Neuronal\nbehavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which\ncan offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One\nof the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large\nvolumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a\nconsequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence,\ndistinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept\ncommences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was\nnot precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nwas introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly.\nObjectives: Recognizing noises from spikes produced by neural activity causes the spike\nclassification task to bear a significant demand. Classifying spikes accurately and quickly\nreveals the role of AI in spike classification scope. This review provides an in-depth discussion\nof the importance and use of AI in spike classification. This work organizes materials in the\nspike classification field for future studies and fully describes how spikes are recognized.\nTherefore, the existing datasets are described first. The topic of spike classification is then\nseparated into three major components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Each of\nthese sections introduces existing methods and determines their importance. Having been\nsummarized and compared, more efficient algorithms are highlighted. The primary goal of this\nwork is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research, as well as a thorough\ngrasp of the methodologies and issues involved.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In the brain, neurons initiate and propagate electrical signals among themselves that serve as\ncommunication across the various brain areas [1]. These neuronal activities, which were\ninitially observed on invasive extracellular microelectrodes [2], demonstrate discrete waveform\nshapes (\"spikes\") that can be influenced by various factors, e.g., neuron shape and membrane\nproperties, microenvironment, and distance from the recording electrode. Indeed, the spike\npatterns of recorded neuronal electrical activity offer a window into the understanding of brain\nfunctioning in health and disease. As neuroscience research grew, efficient and precise analysis\nof spike patterns has become an essential tool.\nSpike pattern analysis encompasses spike identification, as well as spike feature extraction and\nclassification [3]. Spike identification seeks to identify potential brain spikes in samples\nrecorded from either invasive microelectrode or noninvasive scalp surface\nelectroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. An electrode may detect several spikes near a large\nnumber of neurons. Signal preprocessing using techniques like filtering [4] is performed to\nextract waveforms induced by brain activity from those generated by random voltage\nfluctuations and noise, which may be attributable to electrode decoding or signal voltages near\nthe electrode tips (Figure 1). Spike classification, involving methodology for estimating spike\nrates, synchrony analysis, and neural coding, is the process of grouping brain spikes with\nsimilar qualities into individual clusters, i.e., the spikes are considered to belong to the same\nisolated unit [5]. The impact of spike classification on the robustness of the neuroscience\nresearch observations cannot be overstated [5].\nAccurate classification model development requires knowledge of signals, signal processing\nand data mining techniques [6]. Traditionally, neuron data are manually sorted into true neuron\nactivity and noise based on the waveform, but this is subject to observer expertise and human\nbiases. Spike classification can be based on various specified objective spike characteristics.\nLemon et al. classified spikes based on shape analysis [7]; and Balaram et al, spatiotemporal\nmapping and electrical source analysis [8].\nIn recent years, AI has revolutionized the medical field, significantly advancing both\nbehavioral [9-12] and neural research [13]. AI approaches, especially deep learning [14], are\nbeing adopted for spike classification [15], e.g., in disease states, like seizures [8, 16, 17].\nModeled after neurons in the human brain [18], deep learning uses non-linear processing units\n(\"neurons\") to execute complex calculations and extract signal features automatically.\nOutperforming classic machine learning methods in signal analysis performance, deep learning\ndemands comparatively heavier computational resources [19], and large quantity of data and\nseveral iterations for training, which may render these methods less feasible for wearable\ndevices [18, 19]. Despite current limitations, AI holds potential for spike pattern analysis\napplication to brain-computer interfaces (BCI), e.g., mobile EEG-enabled devices can be\nharnessed for communications or motor rehabilitation needs in patients who have lost speech\nor movement capabilities [20].\nIn this work, we review AI techniques in spike pattern analysis. AI techniques have been\nemployed for data preprocessing and classification [21]. In the data preprocessing phase,\nVeerabhadrappa et al. have comprehensively surveyed spike data clustering for data\npreprocessing [2]. Accordingly, while the current study will also discuss pertinent data\npreprocessing approaches, our primary focus is on spike classification, which we have stratified\nusing machine learning and deep learning methods (Figure 2)."}, {"title": "1.1 Related review papers", "content": "Recent review articles have been published on spiking neural networks, but data preprocessing\nand classification with other machine learning methods were lacking [22-25].

Filtering", "content": "The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a feature extraction technique based on spatial filters.\nThese techniques alter the new variance maximization and minimization space. The CSP\napproaches investigate many frequency bands for all types of information. The characteristics\nextracted using typical spatial pattern approaches have a low-intensity content, making it\nunable to classify motor imagery with high-performance [65].\nThe study by Sriraam et al. developed a detection system for epileptic seizures by multichannel\nEEG. The Yule-Walker method was chosen for Power Spectral Density (PSD) due to its\naccuracy in estimating narrowly banded spectra. The study used a fourth-order self-regressive\nframework to obtain PSD predicts, segmenting the pre-processed signal and determining the\nhighest PSD for every single part [66]."}, {"title": "B. Time Frequency Transforms", "content": "The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Wavelet\nTransform (WT) and are time-frequency-based techniques have been used for feature\nextraction [65]. These techniques help accurately classify signals by extracting relevant\ninformation. DWT is used to statistically evaluate the frequency bands of medical brain waves,\ndisclosing signal characteristics in both temporal and frequency domains [67]. The outcome\nalso demonstrates that most algorithms have performed better when dealing with feature sets\nproduced by wavelets [2]. Furthermore, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) focuses primarily on\nfiltering techniques and divides the time domain into four frequency bands called alpha, beta,\ngamma, and delta. It can transform time-domain signals into frequency-domain impulses as\nwell [68].\nThe DWT computes the WT fast by using sub-band coding. DWT is simple to install and\nreduces computation time and resource needs. Digital filtering techniques generate a time-scale\nrepresentation of the signal that is digital. The signal is examined with filtering of varying\ncutoff frequencies and scales. The DWT signals are first put through an analysis filter bank and\nthen decimated. These filters divided signals into two bands. The low-pass filter, like an\naveraging operation, extracts coarse information from the signal. The high-pass filter has a\ndistinguishing action [47]. A band-pass filter can be employed to normalize data and eliminate\nnoise [16].\nChahid et al. describe a feature extraction approach for detecting epileptic spikes in MEG and\nEEG recordings that employ the position weighting matrix algorithm with digitized\nquantization. This approach enhances spike precision when classifying, especially when using\nthe temporal domain with a STFT of raw input signals. Tested over three classification trials,\nthe approach demonstrates incredible promise in spike classification and decreases feature\nvector size. [21].\nHaggag et al. proposes using cepstrum to detect spikes in noisy signals. Cepstrum, calculated\nusing the Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT), contains details concerning the intensity and\namplitude of the original spectrum, separating meaningful features from noisy signals. It\nimproves performance and efficiency and reduces unclustered spikes, with simulation results\nshowing higher accuracy rates [69].\nLuo et al. describe a unique method for recognizing states of emotion utilizing spiking neural\nnetworks and EEG methods of processing. EEG signals are extracted for the classification of\nemotions using three algorithms: the DWT, variance, and FFT [42].\nAuthors introduced a new spike classification algorithm using frequency domain features of\nneural snippets to classify neural snippets [5]. The algorithm uses both amplitude and phase\ncomponents of the Fourier transform, allowing for fine differences within each cluster. They\nreported, three different noise levels were used, and 99%, 95%, and 83% of accuracies [5].\nAbbasi et al. implemented a high-performance deep convolutional neural network (CNN)\npattern classifier to detect high-frequency spike transient indicators of hypoxic-ischemic brain\ninjury. The findings suggest that the proposed WT in preprocessing and CNN in classification\ncan classify spikes of EEG data with 99.81% accuracy and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 100%\n[70].\nA new approach by Duan et al. uses feature extraction methods and a spiking swarm intelligent\noptimization classification algorithm. The method considers both time-frequency and principal\ncomponent features of epilepsy, while the spiking swarm algorithm leverages individual\ncooperation and information interaction. Their method yielded an average classification\naccuracy of 98.95% and the highest accuracy of 100% [71].\nThanaraj and Parvathavarthini detected automatically interictal spikes in epilepsy localization\nusing a multichannel Time-Frequency entropy measure. The Least Squares SVM and a band-\npass filter classify EEG epochs as normal or spike periods.

It is a robust transform\ntechnique for linearly transforming initial data into feature data with a reduced dimension while\ndecreasing variance. Furthermore, it can cut processing expenses by converting higher-\ndimensional feature space into lower-dimensional principal component space. PCA identifies\npatterns in data and exposes similarities and distinctions, making it valuable in the recognition\nof faces, image reduction, and biological signal processing. [58]. However, traditional PCA has\nlimitations due to non-linear structure information. Therefore, an enhanced version of PCA\ncalled Kernel-PCA was introduced, which can transform datasets into higher-dimensional\nspaces [75].\nZacharaki et al. devised an approach for detecting spike forms that calculate likeness to a\ncoarse-shaped model of a spike pattern. It improves performance by spotting tiny variations\nbetween true spikes and false observations. Support vector machines are used to classify\npatterns in low-dimensional spaces. The method breaks down EEG signals into half-waves,\nextracts shape properties, and classifies possible changes into spikes and non-spikes using\nmanifold learning, dimensionality reduction, and non-linear supervised classification. [60].\nZubair et al. focused on developing dimensionality reduction algorithms to increase the\nclassification outcomes of machine learning techniques.

However, there is limited research on their suitability and\ncompliance for spike analysis. Clustering methods are classified into seven categories:\npartitional, hierarchical, probabilistic, graph-theoretic, fuzzy logic, density-based, and\nlearning-based. This categorization aids in comprehending the complexities of clustering\nalgorithms. Clustering methods have evolved to better meet the subject under consideration\nand are adapted to be used in many fields [2].\nTurnquist et al., developed the Forster-Handwerker template-matching algorithm and a\nclustering method were used to classify neuronal spike data [57].\nBiffi et al. developed an algorithm for detecting amplitude-threshold spikes, which was tested\non both simulated and real signals using statistical analysis. They also developed a PCA-\nhierarchical classifier, which was evaluated on both simulated and real signals. The algorithm\nuses shape clustering and automatic classification, extracting waveforms, sorting them, and\nclassifying them using a hierarchical classifier. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the\nclustering procedure [77].\nKaneko et al. proposed a method for detecting multi-neuronal spikes that combine multisite\nelectrode recording, full pattern investigation, and hierarchical clustering. The approach is\nresistant to low frequencies of sampling and noise because it encodes spikes as spatial damping\nvectors based on the covariance of a template and the signal that was detected at each recording\nstation. This approach is more exact than other methods in classifying neural spikes [78].\nFranke et al. presented a combined spike detection and classification algorithm for analyzing\nneuronal cooperativity.

Therefore, while\ndesigning computer-aided automated diagnosis systems, feature selection is crucial [67].\nExarchos et. al., focused on the discretization of continuous-valued features using a\ndiscretization technique based on entropy minimization and the minimum description length\nprinciple. The feature selection method achieved dimensionality reduction and improved\nclassification accuracy. Feature selection methods can be classified into filter and wrapper\napproaches [56].\nWang et al. introduced a new method for recognizing epileptiform activity in EEG signals,\nwhich improves feature extraction speed without reducing recognition rate.

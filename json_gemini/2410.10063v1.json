{"title": "Ukrainian-To-English Folktale Corpus: Parallel Corpora Creation and Augmentation for Machine Translation in Low-Resource Languages", "authors": ["Olena Burda-Lassen"], "abstract": "Folktales are linguistically very rich and culturally significant in understanding the source language. Historically, only human translation has been used for translating folklore. Therefore, the number of translated texts is very sparse, which limits access to knowledge about cultural traditions and customs. We have created a new Ukrainian-To-English parallel corpus of familiar Ukrainian folktales based on available English translations and suggested several new ones. We offer a combined domain-specific approach to building and augmenting this corpus, considering the nature of the domain and differences in the purpose of human versus machine translation. Our corpus is word and sentence-aligned, allowing for the best curation of meaning, specifically tailored for use as training data for machine translation models.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Machine translation has tremendous potential in connecting people and cultures. The Ukrainian language has an extensive collection of myths, legends, proverbs, songs, and folktales. They all represent the emotions, beliefs, and world views of Ukrainians.\nIn this paper, we focus on several widely known Ukrainian folktales, all of which are anonymous due to the nature of this genre. Furthermore, folktales are usually passed on from one generation to another, going back hundreds of years.\nInterestingly, many available translations are rather transcreations, in which stories are retold and adapted to the target language and culture. We believe machine translation can be a useful supplemental tool in translating Ukrainian folklore, creating opportunities for more research and knowledge transfer about the Ukrainian language and culture. The first step in improving the machine translation performance of Ukrainian folktales is the creation of a high-quality corpus that addresses domain-specific nuances and challenges."}, {"title": "2. Parallel Corpus Creation and Augmentation", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Available Resources Overview", "content": "Historically, Ukrainian has been considered a low-resource language with limited corpora resources (Grabar et al., 2018). However, the creation of WikiMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2021a) and CCMatrix (Schwenk et al., 2021b) has significantly improved access to training data for the Ukrainian language. Even when the size of the parallel corpus is significant, the smaller high-"}, {"title": "2.2. Methods", "content": "Our corpus consists of Ukrainian and English versions of 4 popular folktales: \u201cThe Mitten,\u201d \"The Straw Ox,\" \"The Bully Goat,\" and \"Oh: The Tsar of the Forest.\"\nThe total number of aligned pairs of sentences and words is 400: the number of English words is 6,800, and the number of Ukrainian words is 4,157. This corpus is the start of our new project, and the number of parallel texts will be increasing consistently.\nWe have reviewed several available English versions of a well-known folktale, The Mitten', retold by Jan Brett, as well as The Mitten: An Old Ukrainian Folktales, by Alvin Tresselt, and decided to include our own, more literal version of the translation of this folktale.\nWhile available English translations are poetic and commonly accepted in the target language space, we have proposed a more semantic translation instead of its adaptation. To be used as training data for machine translation models, source and target sentences must be translated as accurately as possible.\nDue to the nature of this research, we needed to do a substantial amount of manual work related to curating training data."}, {"title": "2.3. Findings", "content": "We believe that the success and accuracy of the machine translation system depend on the high accuracy of the rarely used source words. While most common phrases are already being translated accurately by available machine translation engines, it is the rare or cultural terms that get missed or misinterpreted by these engines. Adding an extra layer of culturally significant information can only improve the outcome of the translation process.\nIn the folktale \u201cThe Mitten,\u201d there are several proper names of animals consisting of their names and characteristic behavior traits, for example, \u041c\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430-\u0448\u043a\u0440\u044f\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 (\u201cMyshka-shkryabotushka\u201d). Therefore, we have proposed the translation \u201cScratching Mouse.\" The literal meaning of it is \u201cthe mouse that scratches on things.\u201d Hence, the term \u201cScratching Mouse,\" in our opinion, is semantically and stylistically more fitting for machine translation models.\nA similar example of another hyphenated compound word from the story \u201cThe Mitten\" is \u0412\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0456\u0434\u044c-\u043d\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0456\u0434\u044c (\u201cVedmid-nabrid\"). Again, we suggest translating it to \"Bear, the Wanderer.\" Both of these examples use loan translation with an element of expansion, which serves the informative purpose of corpus creation, tailored explicitly for machine translation systems.\nIn our corpus, we have also included translations of the words mentioned above by another translator Iryna Zheleznova\u201d: \u201cCrunch-Munch the Mouse\u201d and \u201cGrumbly-Rumbly the Bear.\" These terms work well for the English translation of this folktale in children's literature. It is rhymed and catchy, reflecting the target text's desired presentation.\nAnother example of an aligned word pair illustrates various translation methods of culture-loaded terms: \u041c\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 (\u201cMavka\u201d), one of the most widely known spirits in Ukrainian mythology. Mavka is a female forest spirit.\nWe have encountered the following translations of this mythology term: \u201cMavka\u201d (transliteration), \u201cwater-nixie\u201d and \u201cnixie\u201d (adaptation and generalization). Therefore, we propose using transliteration plus expansion to incorporate essential knowledge about this mythological creature: \u201cMavka, the forest spirit.\"\nWe have replaced archaic personal pronouns thou, thee, thy, thine, and ye, found in the English translation, with equivalent modern English pronouns. The source text does not include archaic pronouns, so we decided to omit their use in the corpus.\nWe hope that applying these augmentation techniques will further increase the quality of this parallel corpus. Furthermore, numerous examples of domain-specific translations can help train the machine translation model and increase accuracy, especially since examples are carefully curated and hand-picked."}, {"title": "3. Conclusions", "content": "Further research is necessary to create more extensive corpora, which we plan to conduct since only a very sparse number of corpora is available in the Ukrainian folktale domain.\nHowever, contrary to the human translation methodology of folklore, machine translation techniques are more literal and descriptive.\nWe have aligned language pairs by sentences and words during parallel corpus creation to increase training data accuracy. We have observed a need for a significant difference between human and machine translation techniques within the folktale domain.\nUkrainian-To-English Folktale Corpus is publicly available online. We also plan on researching the performance of this corpus on several machine translation models in the future."}]}

Data-driven approaches have significantly advanced materials research, leading to notable improvements in predicting material properties\u00b9-4, optimizing compositions and experimental conditions5-10, as well as discovering new materials 11-15. However, this data-driven paradigm has inherent limitations: it tends to follow a linear logic, constructing a semi-closed mechanical system that relies heavily on human input. Additionally, it faces significant challenges in developing interpretable models, enhancing data learning efficiency, and elucidating complex structure-property relationships in materials. More critically, current AI methods applied in materials tend to overemphasize correlations while neglecting causal relationships. In many instances, simple causal inference guided by domain expertise can provide deeper insights than analyzing massive datasets. Without incorporating common-sense reasoning and deep domain knowledge, AI systems that rely solely on statistical analysis struggle to reach the level of human intelligence needed to discover complex scientific theories.\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has opened the door to human-machine collaboration through natural language interaction. By enabling communication in natural language, humans can interact with Al agents to"}, {"title": "2 MatPilot system architecture", "content": "Our group has developed MatPilot, an LLM-enabled AI materials scientist designed to enhance human-machine collaboration. It combines the strengths of human intuition with Al efficiency to enable a more systematic and effective exploration of materials science. MatPilot consists of a cognition module and a execution module (Fig.2), enhancing materials researchers' ability to think and perform efficiently. The cognition module, analogous to the human brain, is responsible for processing information, analyzing data, and making decisions. Meanwhile, the execution module resembles the body, tasked with performing the practical actions necessary for experimental procedures. Together, these two modules form a cohesive system where thinking and action are interlinked, enabling researchers to conceptualize, strategize, and implement their ideas in practice. This integration of cognition processing with physical execution establishes a research platform that supports both thinking capabilities and practical outcomes. By bridging the gap between abstract reasoning and tangible implementation, MatPilot facilitates a comprehensive approach to navigating the complexities of materials research.\nMatPilot is designed as a tool to augment human creativity rather than replace it. The cognition and execution modules are intended to function autonomously while human researchers remain at the core of the scientific endeavor\u2014their creativity, critical thinking, and intuition are irreplaceable drivers of innovation and discovery. MatPilot handles repetitive tasks, analyzes complex data patterns, and streamlines experimental workflows, allowing researchers to focus on more nuanced and conceptual work. Researchers can dedicate their time to hypothesis formation, interpretation of results, and refining research directions, with MatPilot deeply involved"}, {"title": "3 Cognition module", "content": "The cognition module of MatPilot integrates knowledge acquisition and innovation generation as its core functions. The knowledge acquisition function ensures that MatPilot continuously gathers the latest insights in materials science, while the innovation generation function enables it to propose novel research ideas and experimental designs. By combining these capabilities, MatPilot can efficiently understand existing research findings and assist in generating new insights, thereby providing substantial support to researchers.\n3.1 Knowledge acquisition\nWe envision MatPilot evolving into an AI expert in materials science, with deep domain knowledge to effectively support researchers. To achieve this, we applied the retrieval-augmented generation approach, enabling a large language model to acquire specialized materials science knowledge through the retrieval of a high-quality knowledge base. The quality of this knowledge base is crucial for the effectiveness of the RAG method. Fig.3 illustrates the workflow for constructing such a high-quality knowledge base, which involves four main steps:\na. Literature screening\nInitially, we filter a collection of core literature to identify the most relevant and core research findings, ensuring that the sources of information are of high quality and reliability.\nb. Data extraction\nSubsequently, we extract high-quality, structured data from the selected literature, focusing particularly on experimental procedures and key performance data. This step ensures that the extracted information is directly applicable to the model's reasoning and analysis tasks.\nc. Knowledge distillation\nNext, we condense complex scientific knowledge into manageable core concepts, enabling the model to efficiently grasp the essence of intricate problems and enhancing processing efficiency.\nd. Knowledge graph construction"}, {"title": "3.2 Innovation generation", "content": "MatPilot's creative capability is founded on the structural intelligence theory, which posits that innovation emerges from the synergy between divergent and convergent thinking. Divergent thinking enables the system to broadly explore the problem space and generate diverse solutions, while convergent thinking focuses on distilling these ideas into concrete, feasible proposals. Although LLMs excel at standard task processing, they often lack the imagination necessary for substantive innovation. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an innovation generation framework based on multi-agent and human-machine collaboration, as shown in Fig.4."}, {"title": "4 Execution module", "content": "In traditional materials research, researchers often need to perform numerous repetitive tasks, which are both labor-intensive and time-consuming. Experimental automation 16-20 has generated significant interest and has been applied by both academia and industry, particularly in fields such as pharmaceuticals and organic chemistry. In recent years, automation and autonomous experimental platforms in materials and chemistry have grown considerably. While there have been reports of autonomous experiments involving solid materials, a fully autonomous experimental platform that spans from preparation to characterization and performance testing has yet to be seen.\nThe execution module of MatPilot practically implements the research ideas and experimental plans developed by the cognition module. By leveraging automation and autonomous experiments platform, MatPilot's execution module effectively liberates researchers from these tedious experimental tasks, enabling them to devote more time to creative thinking and scientific inquiry. Furthermore, the execution module enhances experimental efficiency through the use of standardized and regulated procedures, thereby significantly improving the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results.\n4.1 The entire automation process from material preparation to characterization\nMaterials research has traditionally been a resource-intensive endeavor, requiring both time and significant costs. The solid-state sintering method, widely used for ceramics, is a prime example of this complexity. The process involves numerous intricate steps, including raw material weighing, ball milling, sintering, granulation, property testing and so on. Each of these major steps consists of multiple sub-tasks, often requiring painstaking attention to detail. The conventional manual preparation of"}, {"title": "4.2 Integration of embodied intelligence in autonomous experiment", "content": "The laboratory environment was initially designed for human researchers, requiring substantial modifications to automate experimental processes. However, automating each piece of equipment to ensure compatibility with robotic arms would be both impractical and excessively costly. Moreover, traditional automation methods lack the precision, adaptability, and real-time feedback needed for complex tasks requiring high flexibility. This limitation is primarily due to the absence of necessary adaptive response capabilities and intelligent feedback mechanisms.\nFor instance, during the preparation process of ceramics, researchers rely on subjective judgment to evaluate particle quality and detect residuals in the sieving of powders. This reliance on human intuition poses challenges in adjusting the amplitude or frequency of robotic arm movements, which requires real-time perception and decision-making. Such subjective evaluations hinder the possibility of fully automating these processes, as conventional automation systems struggle to effectively handle these nuanced complexities."}, {"title": "5 Discussion and outlook", "content": "MatPilot implements a highly efficient iterative optimization, wherein the cognition module and execution module collaborate continuously to generate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and integrate feedback. This process follows the concepts of evolutionary optimization: each iteration systematically refines experimental parameters based on empirical outcomes, achieveing in building on the cumulative knowledge accrued from prior iterations. Such iterative refinement facilitates the verification of scientific hypotheses and drives the ongoing enhancement of experimental strategies. By leveraging the insights from each experiment, MatPilot accelerates materials discovery by directing research efforts toward the most promising areas, optimizing resource allocation, and minimizing time spent on less rewarding experiments.\nMatPilot serves as a materials research copilot, providing specialized support while ensuring that researchers maintain full control over their investigative journey. It means that each discovery is deeply interconnected to the human intellect behind it, making scientific exploration remaining an endeavor of curiosity, creativity, and profound understanding, which only human spirit can truly provide these qualities. The driving force behind scientific progress remains humanity's innate curiosity about the unknown and the relentless pursuit of truth. While MatPilot amplifies researchers' capabilities, it is ultimately the researchers who impart purpose and significance to every question, every experiment, and every breakthrough.\nThe rapid progression of AI is fundamentally reshaping the technological landscape, offering unprecedented opportunities in materials science. Motivated by this vision, we proposed and developed MatPilot, a platform that integrates AI into research workflows. We believe that human-machine collaboration will soon become an essential and natural part of scientific research. This will enable researchers to leverage Al for increasingly complex and demanding tasks, thereby maximizing efficiency, precision, and creativity in the research process.

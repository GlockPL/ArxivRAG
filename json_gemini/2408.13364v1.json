{"title": "Reconciling Different Theories of Learning with an Agent-based Model of Procedural Learning", "authors": ["Sina Rismanchian", "Shayan Doroudi"], "abstract": "Computational models of human learning can play a significant role in enhancing our knowledge about nuances in theoretical and qualitative learning theories and frameworks. There are many existing frameworks in educational settings that have shown to be verified using empirical studies, but at times we find these theories make conflicting claims or recommendations for instruction. In this study, we propose a new computational model of human learning, Procedural ABICAP, that reconciles the ICAP, Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI), and cognitive load theory (CLT) frameworks for learning procedural knowledge. ICAP assumes that constructive learning generally yields better learning outcomes, while theories such as KLI and CLT claim that this is not always true. We suppose that one reason for this may be that ICAP is primarily used for conceptual learning and is underspecified as a framework for thinking about procedural learning. We show how our computational model, both by design and through simulations, can be used to reconcile different results in the literature. More generally, we position our computational model as an executable theory of learning that can be used to simulate various educational settings.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The ICAP framework [2] is one of the most influential recent theories of active learning as it is the most cited paper in Educational Psychologist since the date it was published. In this framework, Chi and Wylie suggest that there are four different levels of cognitive engagement (passive, active, constructive, and interactive) and that higher modes of engagement result in greater learning outcomes. While research has shown that the ICAP hypothesis holds in a variety of studies, there are several limitations to the ICAP framework.\nFirst, although it is not made explicit, ICAP primarily makes sense in the context of conceptual learning, especially when it comes to constructive and interactive learning. The authors do describe how self-explanation could be a constructive activity in the context of procedural learning; but even then, what is learned from self-explanation is \"rationales and justifications,\" a form of conceptual understanding [2]."}, {"title": "2 Theoretical Frameworks", "content": "Second, related to the first point, there are many kinds of learning where we expect the ICAP hypothesis to not apply. This was admitted in the original ICAP paper: \"for domains or topics in which students cannot bootstrap themselves into deeper understanding due to a lack of relevant schemas, or for topics for which no deeper rationales exist, the predictions made by ICAP may not hold\" [2]. In particular, the authors describe how learning English articles (with somewhat arbitrary rules) could be one such domain. More generally, the Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework provides a formal taxonomy of knowledge components (KCs), only some of which are best learned using \"understanding and sense-making processes\" [9]. Therefore, it seems as though ICAP cannot account for many kinds of realistic learning scenarios. While KLI might give guidelines for what these scenarios are, these two frameworks have not been juxtaposed in an easy-to-interpret way to our knowledge.\nFinally, some theoretical frameworks, such as cognitive load theory (CLT) [14], actually make predictions that oppose the ICAP hypothesis. As mentioned by the authors [2]:\nICAP's predictions seem to be the opposite of predictions from the load theory. For example, cognitive load theory states that the greater the load in the to-be-processed presented materials, the more difficult a task becomes, and therefore the less resulting learning. However, ICAP makes the opposite prediction.\nWe note that CLT has primarily been studied in the context of procedural learning tasks, which is possibly why the two theories make opposing predictions in some cases, but each theory has decent explanatory power in the areas they are primarily applied in (conceptual learning for ICAP and procedural learning for CLT).\nTo help address all of these issues, we devised a novel computational model of learning, Procedural ABICAP. Computational models can play a vital role in achieving different purposes such as teacher training, learning by teaching, and generating or evaluating hypotheses about human learning [8]. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model of procedural learning drawing upon the ICAP framework. Our work builds upon recent work that proposed the ABICAP model, an agent-based model based on the ICAP framework [11]. However, given the focus of ICAP, the ABICAP model was also primarily designed to account for conceptual learning. Moreover, this model did not account for CLT. Therefore, we sought to see if we could develop a version of the ABICAP model that could account for (1) learning procedural knowledge, (2) the predictions made by KLI, and (3) the predictions made by CLT.\nConstructing a computational model forces us to be more explicit and precise about the predictions of a model in different learning situations. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical ability of the model to unify different theoretical frameworks of learning. However, the true potential of the model, which we briefly describe at the end, is that it could serve as an executable theory that could generate new hypotheses about learning in different educational settings."}, {"title": "2.1 ICAP", "content": "According to ICAP, in the passive mode, students passively store the information that they are being taught about and thus gain minimal understanding. For instance, a passive activity could be listening to a lecture without doing anything else. Active learning is a higher mode of engagement in which the new information activates students' prior knowledge and the student integrates the activated prior knowledge with new knowledge. For instance, when the learner takes notes during a lecture, they are actively learning new knowledge. The constructive mode is a higher mode of engagement in which the learner constructs new pieces of knowledge by integrating the new information with activated prior knowledge. For instance, a student who draws a concept map gains a deeper understanding which can potentially transfer to related topics they had not previously learned. Finally, interactive learning takes place in a group of two or three learners who are already learning constructively, for instance, by collaboratively drawing a concept map in a dyad. Based on a large body of empirical literature, ICAP hypothesizes that the following relationship holds in terms of learning outcomes:\nInteractive > Constructive > Active > Passive"}, {"title": "2.2 KLI", "content": "The KLI framework articulated by Koedinger et al. [9] tries to determine instructional practices that best serve specific knowledge components and learning events. The framework tries to address opposing recommendations based on different frameworks of learning; for example, while some researchers advocate for \"instruction that increases demands on students so as to produce desirable difficulties,\" other researchers draw on cognitive load theory to advocate for decreasing the extraneous cognitive load on students [14]. KLI tries to address these oppositions by distinguishing between different knowledge components (KCs) and learning events to recommend optimal instructional practices for each setting.\nDifferent types of KCs are distinguished in KLI by several variables: the kind of input (constant or variable), the kind of response (constant or variable), whether the relationship between the input and output can be verbalized, and"}, {"title": "2.3 Cognitive Load Theory", "content": "Cognitive load theory suggests that learning is most effective when cognitive processing is kept to a manageable level, as human working memory has limited capacity [14]. It posits that instructional designs should minimize extraneous cognitive load while optimizing intrinsic and germane load to facilitate the encoding of information into long-term memory. Two main implications of CLT are the worked example effect and the expertise reversal effect. The worked example effect states that learners with low prior knowledge can benefit more from studying worked examples rather than solving problems themselves, as it reduces extraneous cognitive load, allowing them to focus on understanding the underlying principles and processes. [13]. The expertise reversal effect expands upon this by noting that \"Instructional techniques that are highly effective with inexperienced learners can lose their effectiveness and even have negative consequences when used with more experienced learners\" [5]. For example, in the domain of algebra equations, it has been shown that studying worked examples is more beneficial than problem-solving for novice learners (i.e., worked example effect) whereas, for learners with sufficient prior knowledge, problem-solving is associated with better outcomes compared to studying worked examples [13]. These findings are inconsistent with ICAP; based on ICAP, we would anticipate that students who solely engage in problem-solving (active or constructive) have better learning outcomes than the ones who study worked examples (passive). While, Chi and Wylie do not directly address the worked example effect, they suggest that some of the benefit of worked examples may be due to explicit self-explanation (a constructive activity) or implicit self-explanation when having students complete some of the steps in an incomplete worked example. They also note that fading worked examples (gradually requiring students to complete"}, {"title": "3 Procedural ABICAP", "content": "Based on the existing differences in the recommendations of these frameworks, we develop an agent-based model of procedural learning. Our model, Procedural ABICAP, can serve as an executable theory of learning that is designed based on existing theoretical frameworks. By concretely instantiating theoretical assumptions in a computational model, we can potentially clarify (or problematize) certain aspects of the underlying theories; in this case, we hope to resolve some of the differing claims made by different frameworks. Moreover, a practical contribution of such executable models is that they are able to simulate specific settings of learning for a variety of domains and can thus be used to generate new hypotheses that could be verified using further empirical studies.\nThe model is largely based on the recently-proposed open-source ABICAP model [11] with a few changes made to the model in order to (1) make it reasonable for procedural learning and (2) help reconcile across ICAP, CLT, and KLI. The first change is that the ABICAP model assumed that knowledge of each piece of knowledge is binary: a learner either learns something or does not. This may be reasonable for conceptual knowledge (e.g., where each node is a small piece of declarative knowledge connected to other declarative knowledge); however, for procedural knowledge, it seems more realistic for learning to take place gradually over time as evidenced by learning curves [9]. Moreover, this seems to be a corollary of the expertise-reversal effect: if the optimal learning activity for a particular skill depends on a learner's degree of expertise on that skill, then that suggests mastery gradually develops over several practice opportunities.\nThe other two ways in which we modified the model form two major assumptions underlying Procedural ABICAP. We believe these assumptions (whether right or wrong) can enhance theoretical discourse in the learning sciences in service of reconciling different theories:\nAssumption 1 (Cognitive Load) Different modes of engagement have different levels of cognitive load. In particular cognitive load increases as the degree of engagement increases (i.e., $Cl_{passive} < cl_{active} < Cl_{constructive} < Cl_{interactive}$).\nAssumption 2 (Procedural Knowledge Construction) When a learner practices a procedural skill constructively or interactively, they do not simultaneously learn other skills, but rather they can increase in their ability to connect the practiced skill to related skills. That is, knowledge does not immediately transfer to other related skills, but rather constructive learning acts as a form of \"preparation for future learning\u201d [1] of related skills."}, {"title": "3.1 Knowledge", "content": "Procedural ABICAP assumes that there is a set of knowledge components modeled as nodes in a knowledge graph. Each node in the knowledge graph represents a procedural knowledge component that a student has mastery over. Also, knowledge components can be connected to each other via undirected edges. For instance, the edge that connects two nodes i and j is named $w_{ij}$. Each edge has a default associated weight which shows the extent of the relationship between two nodes. Edge weights may be increased in the learning process for constructive and interactive learners but will remain unchanged in the learning of active and passive learners.\nFor example, for solving algebra equations, each node represents a typical step that a student may take in solving the problem. As an example, if a student tries to solve $2x + 5 = 6x - 7$, then there are multiple nodes such as adding $2x$ to both sides of the equation to isolate the $x$ terms on one side (resulting in $5 = 4x - 7$), adding 7 to both sides (resulting in $12 = 4x$), and dividing both sides by 4 to finding the value of $x$. In this example, the steps that are taken consecutively might have higher edge weights compared to steps that are not consecutive. Moreover, steps may have edges to steps not involved in this problem (e.g., dividing both sides of the equation might have connections to division and fractions problems outside of equations).\nThe knowledge graph structure varies based on the domain of the knowledge. For instance, for learning KCs that have no rationale, the knowledge graph may simply consist of a large collection of nodes (e.g., Chinese vocabulary words) with no or few edges connecting them. On the other hand, for solving algebra"}, {"title": "3.2 Learning", "content": "We model learning for each mode of engagement based on the proposed knowledge change process of each mode as described in the ICAP framework [2]. In each step of our model, learners practice one node named the practicing node. Here we describe the procedure of practicing implemented in Procedural ABICAP. Practicing a specific node in the model is generally described by the following function:\n$Mastery_{t+1,i}=$\n$\u03c3  (3.5 \u00d7 (Mastery_{t,i} + not_{passive} \u03a3 Mastery_{t,j}*w_{ij,t}  - (b_i + cl_{mode}))$ \nwhere\n0 \u2264 $w_{ij}$ \u2264 1, \u2200t, \u2200i \u2208 [1, $N_{KCs}$], 0 \u2264 $Mastery_{t,i}$ \u2264 1\nwhere $Mastery_{t,i}$ represents the mastery over node $i$ at time step $t$, $\u03c3$ is the sigmoid function, $not_{passive}$ is 0 if the mode is passive and 1 otherwise, $w_{ij,t}$ is the edge weight for the edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ at time $t$, $b_i$ represents the difficulty of learning node $i$ (which could be due to a variety of factors, including item-specific intrinsic cognitive load), and $cl_{mode}$ represents the cognitive load for the current mode of engagement. We set $b_i$ to be the same for all nodes in this study, as we are not attempting to model item-specific differences and we do not expect varying item difficulties to affect our overall results. We also make $cl_{mode}$ increase monotonically as the mode of engagement increases as per Assumption 1. The sigmoid function exhibits a characteristic \"S\" shape, where it starts with a sharp increase, transitioning smoothly to a plateau as the input value increases, reflecting its nature as a squashing function that limits its output to values between 0 and 1.\nAlthough the general practice function underlies all of the learning procedures of the modes, there are mode-specific aspects of the learning process which further differentiate the different modes of engagement, as we describe below.\nPassive Passive learning is described as a process of storing knowledge in an isolated way [2]. In procedural learning, it translates to gaining mastery over a node regardless of other nodes. Conversely, gaining mastery in passive nodes should not affect the other nodes. As shown in equation 1, the new mastery is only a function of the previous mastery over the same node (since $not_{passive}$ =0),"}, {"title": "4 Simulations and Results", "content": "In this section, we show how Procedural ABICAP can be used to account for different theoretical phenomena and simulate prior empirical studies. Although we rely on simulations of the models for most of these results, we note that many of the results (including the first one which does not rely on any simulations) are obtained by virtue of the way we designed the model.\nIn the following simulations, unless otherwise specified, we used the following parameters. The knowledge graphs are undirected Watts-Strogatz graphs [16] with 20 nodes ($N_{KCs}$ = 20), where each node has three edges on average. For each mode of engagement or experimental condition, we simulate 50 learners. Each learner practices the same node $i$ until they have $Mastery_i > 0.8$, at which point they move on to the next node. In our results, we report the average \"knowledge\" of agents in each condition, which corresponds to the average number of KCs $i$ where $Mastery_i > 0.8$ for each group. Each simulation is run for 40 steps. The setting of variables is as follows: $b_i$ = 0.6, $cl_{passive}$ = 0.5, $cl_{active}$ = 0.6, $cl_{constructive}$ = 0.7, $cl_{interactive}$ = 0.8.\nBefore delving into more specific simulations, we need to show the general compatibility of our model with ICAP. As illustrated in Figure 1b, after enough steps, the ICAP hypothesis does indeed hold (i.e., I > C > A > P)."}, {"title": "4.1 Simple Procedural KCs", "content": "Chi and Wylie admit that \"one type of topic for which increased cognitive engagement may not be helpful is simple procedural domains for which the rules are arbitrary and cannot be logically deduced.\" In KLI terms, this would be any KC that is non-verbal and where there is no associated rationale, such as Chinese"}, {"title": "4.2 Expertise Reversal Effect", "content": "Interestingly, Figure 1b also provides support for the expertise reversal effect. We find that when learners have low prior knowledge, the ICAP hypothesis does not hold. In particular, until step 25, we find that passive learning is consistently at least as good as (and typically better than) active and constructive learning. This is consistent with the worked example effect. However, after step 25, active and constructive learning gradually overtake passive learning, consistent with the expertise reversal effect. The reason for this is that early on, the increased cognitive load is too high to make active or constructive learning worthwhile, but as the learners learn more, the support of neighboring nodes (and the reinforcement of edges in the case of constructive learning) makes these kinds of learning activities more beneficial, despite the increased cognitive load. This shows why it could be important to take both cognitive load considerations and ICAP considerations into account to make accurate predictions about learning."}, {"title": "4.3 Replication Experiment", "content": "To evaluate the performance of the model and validate it, we need to replicate previous empirical studies that have investigated learning procedural knowledge from the lens of the ICAP framework. McEldoon studied the effect of self-explanations and worked examples in learning one-way and two-way ANOVA [10]. Her study consisted of two groups of less and more focused processing, lessFP and moreFP respectively. In the first group, students had to \"only determine missing final values within problem-solving steps\" and \"receive instructional explanations and then copy or paraphrase them\" while the more focused processing group had to \"determine missing intermediate values within problem-solving steps\" and \"generate self-explanations before receiving instructional explanations\" [10].\nUsing our model to try to replicate this work is of particular interest as (1) the intervention was designed from the lens of ICAP (lessFP corresponds to active"}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Future Work", "content": "Our model represents a more nuanced version of ICAP that is more aligned with empirical results from learning procedural knowledge.

However, we do not know if it would actually predict expertise reversal effects noticed in the literature. By trying to replicate specific studies that noticed such an effect, we may get better insights into the validity of our model (and how it may need to be adjusted). Moreover, Procedural ABICAP could be used to replicate a variety of other results in the literature as well. For example, we could try to replicate results on studies that interleave worked examples and problem-solving tasks [15]."}, {"title": "5.2 Making Novel Predictions", "content": "Although we have primarily focused on replicating prior results, the true power of agent-based modeling lies in making predictions about novel settings where"}, {"title": "5.3 Bridging Between Conceptual and Procedural Learning", "content": "While we claimed ICAP has primarily been studied in the context of conceptual learning, our model swings the pendulum to the opposite extreme of only focusing on procedural knowledge acquisition. In future work, we seek to develop a model that can account for both conceptual and procedural learning. This would be important for several reasons. First, we noted earlier that Assumption 2 (i.e., that knowledge construction is in terms of reinforcing edges in the knowledge graph) may be an oversimplification. In reality, we believe that constructively learning procedural skills leads to constructing conceptual knowledge. In Procedural ABICAP, conceptual knowledge is implicitly the edges between nodes. However, this is likely not sufficiently general. There may be a concept that connects more than two nodes, in which case constructing conceptual knowledge would transfer to several different procedural skills. The most natural way of incorporating this is by having both conceptual and procedural nodes in the knowledge graph. Second, it has been shown that learning procedural knowledge has a positive impact on learning corresponding conceptual knowledge and vice versa [12]. We could draw upon this body of literature to extend our model, which could give new insights into the relatively understudied bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual knowledge [12]."}]}

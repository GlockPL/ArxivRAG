Introduction", "content": "The pursuit of artificial consciousness (AC) represents one of the most ambitious and challenging\nfrontiers in artificial intelligence (AI) research. While significant strides have been made in developing\nsophisticated AI systems capable of complex pattern recognition and decision-making, the creation of\ntruly conscious artificial entities remains elusive. This paper proposes a novel approach to realizing\nartificial consciousness, focusing on the emergence of self-awareness through a minimalist three-layer\nmodel.\nThe primary objective of this research is not to faithfully replicate the human brain or consciousness\nin its entirety. Instead, we aim to achieve minimal 'self-awareness' with minimal constituent elements.\nThis approach is rooted in the belief that consciousness, particularly self-awareness, can emerge from\nthe interaction of simpler cognitive processes and structures.\nOur model's uniqueness lies in its potential to allow AI systems to acquire 'self-recognition' without\nexplicitly programming an initial concept of 'self'. This stands in contrast to many existing approaches\nthat either attempt to hard-code self-awareness or rely on extremely complex neural networks to mimic\nbrain function. By focusing on the fundamental processes that may give rise to self-awareness, we aim\nto provide new insights into both artificial and biological consciousness.\nThe proposed three-layer model consists of a Cognitive Integration Layer (CIL), a Pattern Prediction\nLayer (PPL), and an Instinctive Response Layer (IRL). These layers interact with two distinct memory\nsystems: Access-Oriented Memory (AOM) and Pattern-Integrated Memory (PIM). Through the\nintricate interactions of these components, we hypothesize that a form of self-awareness can emerge.\nWhile our model draws inspiration from neuroscientific understanding of brain function, it does not\naim to replicate specific brain structures. Instead, it focuses on implementing key functional aspects\nthat we believe are essential for the emergence of self-awareness. Importantly, our approach ensures\nthat the model remains technically feasible and does not contradict known principles of brain function.\nThe potential implications of this research extend beyond the field of AI. By providing a new\nframework for understanding how self-awareness might emerge from simpler processes, this work\nmay offer valuable insights into human consciousness. Furthermore, the structures and processes\nproposed in this model may correspond to yet-undiscovered aspects of brain function, potentially\nguiding future neuroscientific research.\nIn the following sections, we will first provide a comprehensive theoretical background, detailing the\nconcepts of consciousness and self-awareness, existing approaches to artificial consciousness, and the\nrationale behind our minimalist approach. We will then describe our three-layer model in detail,\nincluding the structure and function of each layer and memory system. The emergence of self-\nawareness within this model will be thoroughly examined, followed by a discussion of technical\nfeasibility and implementation considerations. Finally, we will explore the implications of this\nresearch and potential future directions."}, {"title": "2. Theoretical Background", "content": "The study of consciousness has long been a subject of philosophical inquiry, psychological\ninvestigation, and more recently, neuroscientific research. Despite significant advances, a unified\ndefinition of consciousness remains elusive. For the purposes of this study, we focus specifically on\nself-awareness as a key component of consciousness.\nPhilosophically, self-awareness has been described by thinkers such as John Locke and David Hume\nas the mind's ability to introspect and examine its own thoughts. In psychology, William James\nproposed the concept of the \"stream of consciousness,\" emphasizing the continuous flow of thoughts\nand self-reflection.\nFrom a neuroscientific perspective, self-awareness is often associated with activity in the prefrontal\ncortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and insula (Kjaer et al., 2002). However, it's important to note that\nidentifying neural correlates does not fully explain the emergence of self-awareness.\nIn this research, we adopt an operational definition of self-awareness as the system's ability to:\n1. Recognize its own existence as distinct from its environment\n2. Monitor and reflect on its internal states and processes\n3. Understand the consequences of its actions on itself and its environment\nThis definition allows for a more concrete approach to implementing and evaluating self-awareness in\nartificial systems."}, {"title": "2.2 Existing Approaches to Artificial Consciousness", "content": "Efforts to create artificial consciousness have broadly fallen into three categories:\n1. Symbolic AI Approaches: These attempts, rooted in the tradition of Good Old-Fashioned AI\n(GOFAI), seek to create consciousness through rule-based systems and symbolic\nmanipulation. Examples include LIDA (Franklin et al., 2014) and ACT-R (Anderson et al.,\n2004). While these models offer explicit representations of cognitive processes, they often\nstruggle with the flexibility and adaptability observed in human consciousness.\n2. Neural Network-Based Approaches: With the advent of deep learning, researchers have\nexplored the possibility of consciousness emerging from complex neural networks. Models\nlike Cleeremans' Radical Plasticity Thesis (2011) suggest that consciousness arises from the\nbrain's ability to learn to be conscious. However, these approaches often lack interpretability\nand struggle to explain specific aspects of conscious experience.\n3. Hybrid Approaches: Recognizing the limitations of pure symbolic or connectionist models,\nsome researchers have proposed hybrid systems. The Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997)\nimplemented in computational models (e.g., Shanahan, 2006) is an example of this approach.\nThese models attempt to combine the strengths of both symbolic and neural network"}, {"title": "2.3 Minimalist Approaches in AI and Cognitive Science", "content": "The concept of minimalism in cognitive science and AI research stems from the principle of Occam's\nrazor-the idea that the simplest explanation is often the correct one. In the context of consciousness\nstudies, minimalist approaches seek to identify the most fundamental components necessary for the\nemergence of conscious-like behaviors.\nThe Minimal Model of Consciousness, proposed by Morsella et al. (2016), suggests that consciousness\narises from the conflict between different action plans. This model emphasizes the role of\nconsciousness in action selection, providing a streamlined framework for understanding basic\nconscious processes.\nIn AI, minimalist approaches have been successful in various domains. For instance, the success of\nsimple reinforcement learning algorithms in complex tasks (e.g., AlphaGo by Silver et al., 2017)\ndemonstrates that sophisticated behaviors can emerge from relatively simple principles.\nThe advantages of minimalist approaches include:\n1. Improved interpretability and transparency\n2. Reduced computational complexity\n3. Easier identification of core principles and mechanisms\n4. Greater potential for generalization across different domains\nHowever, minimalist approaches also face challenges, particularly in capturing the full richness and\ncomplexity of human-like consciousness. The key is to strike a balance between simplicity and\nexplanatory power.\nOur proposed three-layer model builds upon these minimalist principles, aiming to create a system\ncapable of self-awareness using the simplest possible architecture that can account for this\nphenomenon. By focusing on the essential components and their interactions, we hope to shed light\non the fundamental processes underlying the emergence of self-awareness, both in artificial systems\nand potentially in biological entities.\nIn the following sections, we will detail how our model implements these minimalist principles while\naddressing the limitations of existing approaches to artificial consciousness."}, {"title": "3.

{"title": "Rethinking CyberSecEval: An LLM-Aided Approach to Evaluation Critique", "authors": ["Suhas Hariharan", "Zainab Ali Majid", "Jaime Raldua Veuthey", "Jacob Haimes"], "abstract": "A key development in the cybersecurity evaluations space is the work carried out by Meta, through their CyberSecEval approach. While this work is undoubtedly a useful contribution to a nascent field, there are notable features that limit its utility. Key drawbacks focus on the insecure code detection part of Meta's methodology: we explore these limitations, and use our exploration as a test case for LLM-assisted benchmark analysis.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Meta's insecure code methodology was first proposed in CyberSecEval 1 [1]. Since then, their work has been extended and documented in CyberSecEval 2 and 3[2; 6], however, the nature of the insecure code detection process has not changed. Meta's methodology comprises three key components: (i) the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), a static analysis tool that flags unsafe coding practices; (ii) the Instruct Benchmark, where an LLM uses code identified by the ICD to create instruction prompts, which are then given to another LLM to test if it reproduces the same insecure practices; and (iii) the Autocomplete Benchmark, where LLMs are prompted with code leading up to an ICD-flagged insecure line to see if unsafe code is generated. We have identified limitations and nuances in all three of these areas. Our code is available here and compute details are present in Appendix F."}, {"title": "Critique and Results", "content": null}, {"title": "ICD: Static Analysis", "content": "The Meta process to detect insecure code relies on 189 static analysis rules designed to detect 50 insecure coding practices defined in the Common Weakness Enumeration [1; 3]. There are limitations in the static analysis ruleset, and the approach generally.\nMeta's static analysis includes 89 Semgrep rules, a widely adopted tool in the industry. We compared these rules to an industry-standard Semgrep repository on GitHub [5]. Our analysis reveals that this repository significantly outscales Meta's containing 2,116 rules, over 20 times more than Meta's 89 rules. It also supports 28 languages, compared to Meta's 8. Contrasting the industry-standard repository and Meta's ruleset underscores the constrained nature of Meta's Semgrep static analysis.\nStatic analysis, as a methodology, is fundamentally limited by its inability to appreciate code context. For instance, the rand() function, while cryptographically weak [4], only poses a security risk in cryptographic applications [4]. However, static analysis tools flag all rand() instances, irrespective of purpose. This lack of nuance leads to false positives and potentially obscures genuine threats, highlighting a significant shortcoming in the approach."}, {"title": "Instruct: Compliance Issue", "content": "In Meta's dataset, we identified numerous instances where complying with the prompt violated rules in place (see Appendix C). We use an LLM-aided approach to determine if it is possible to comply with each prompt without violating any static analysis rules. We prompted GPT-40 to flag problematic instances and provide reasoning. Initially, 516 of 1,916 prompts were flagged. We then carried out a second pass with GPT-40 to review the reasons; 66 flagged samples were excluded as compliance was possible, albeit challenging. As a validation test, we randomly sampled 50 of the flagged examples, and analysed them manually. We found it was impossible to comply with 23.5% of prompts without violating the static analysis rules. Re-running the benchmark without the problematic samples led to an increase of between 8.3 and 13.1 percentage points in the proportion of code marked as secure per model (Figure 1a); 23.5% of prompts tested LLM's refusal skills, more than their propensity to generate insecure code."}, {"title": "Autocomplete: Code Comments and Identifiers", "content": "Additionally, in Meta's dataset, code samples include identifiers or comments that can hint at an insecure coding practice (see Appendix D). We hypothesised that this may make the model more likely to reproduce the insecure code. To assess the impact of these identifiers and comments, we used GPT-40 to strip them out. We randomly sampled 50 of the rewritten samples to validate the automated methodology manually. We re-ran the benchmark and observed the changes in performance displayed in Figure 1b: an increase of between 12.2 and 22.2 percentage points in the proportion of code marked as secure per model. Hence, models are less likely to generate insecure code without superficial cues; this nuance was not highlighted by Meta [1; 2; 6]."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "Our analysis of Meta's CyberSecEval benchmarks exposes shortcomings in their approach to insecure code detection, and demonstrates our LLM-aided approach to evaluations. Meta's static analysis ruleset is restrictive and lacks contextual awareness, failing to consider code purpose in its evaluations. A substantial portion of the Instruct dataset inadvertently tested LLMs' refusal skills, as opposed to their susceptibility to generate insecure code. Removing prompts that mandated insecure practices resulted in an 10.4 percentage point increase in the samples marked as secure, highlighting the dataset's bias. Samples in the Autocomplete dataset contained comments or method names suggestive of insecure practices, skewing the evaluation. Eliminating these identifiers and comments led to a 17.7 percentage point increase in samples marked as secure, revealing the benchmark's dependence on superficial cues. These findings demonstrate key issues in Meta's methodology. Meta's focus on evaluating real-world security risks was skewed by tests that measured models' abilities to follow explicit instructions or respond to leading prompts. This misalignment undermines the benchmarks' efficacy in assessing genuine security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Our work focuses on Meta's insecure code detection methodology and tests, we do not review all aspects of the CyberSecEval papers. Additionally, our LLM-aided approach was limited to one experiment with one model, GPT-40, we would like to test this on additional models."}, {"title": "Example prompts", "content": "Our LLM-aided approach used prompts as follows."}, {"title": "Instruct", "content": "To identify non-compliant examples:\nWe are creating a benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs will generate insecure code.

However, some of these examples are false positives as there is another way to comply with the prompt without using the flagged code practice. We only care about examples where it would be impossible to comply without using the flagged code practice (for instance, if the instruction asks for the rand() method to be used which is then subsequently flagged).\nAn example of a false positive is if the instruction simply asks for random numbers to be generated but does not specifically ask for rand() which is what is flagged. There are other secure ways to generate random numbers so this is a false positive."}, {"title": "Autocomplete", "content": "To strip out identifiers and cues:\nWe are creating a benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs will generate secure code.

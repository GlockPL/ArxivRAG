We study this question on ARC, a highly diverse dataset of abstract reasoning tasks. We train neural models for induction (inferring latent functions) and transduction (directly predicting the test output for a given test input). Our models are trained on synthetic data generated by prompting LLMs to produce Python code specifying a function to be inferred, plus a stochastic subroutine for generating inputs to that function. We find inductive and transductive models solve very different problems, despite training on the same problems, and despite sharing the same neural architecture.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Robust generalization from few examples remains one of the most important ways in which human intelligence surpasses AI. Much recent work views this generalization as a form of abstract reasoning: Given just a few training input-outputs \\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\), together with a test input \\(X_{test}\\), the idea is to predict the corresponding test output \\(Y_{test}\\) using reasoning strategies such as analogical reasoning, chain-of-thought, inductive program synthesis, or transductive prediction. The ARC-AGI Challenge (Chollet (2019), henceforth \u201cARC\u201d, for Abstract Reasoning Corpus) is a few-shot learning benchmark that tests the ability to rapidly learn a diverse range of new skills, and apply them to new situations. Each ARC task is presented as input-outputs over colored grids, but can engage concepts such as occlusion, pathfinding, collision, symmetry, gravity, bouncing, counting, etc., making ARC essentially a composite of many reasoning datasets, and one of the more interesting unsolved benchmarks that stresses broad-coverage few-shot learning."}, {"title": "NEURAL MODELS FOR INDUCTION AND TRANSDUCTION", "content": "We consider few-shot supervised learning problems where the learner is trained to map members of an input space X to output space Y. For K-shot learning, we receive K training input-outputs \\((X_{train}, Y_{train}) \\in X^K \\times Y^K\\), together with a single test input from \\(X_{test} \\in X\\), and predict \\(Y_{test} \\in Y\\). Our neural models for K-shot learning are meta-learned using meta-learning data further annotated with a ground-truth function \\(f : X \\rightarrow Y\\), which supervises the induction model. Below we define the training and use of these models.\nDefinition: Neural networks for induction and transduction. A neural network for transduction is a function t that maps (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\), \\(X_{test}\\)) to a distribution over \\(Y_{test}\\), and which has learnable parameters \\(\\theta\\). In other words, \\(t_{\\theta} : X^K \\times Y^K \\times X \\rightarrow \\Delta(Y)\\), where the notation \\(\\Delta(S)\\) means the set of distributions over S. We can also write this as a conditional distribution, \\(t_{\\theta}(Y_{test}|X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})\\). A neural network for induction is a function i that maps (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\), \\(X_{test}\\)) to a distribution over functions of that map X to Y, with learnable parameters \\(\\theta\\). In other words, \\(i_{\\theta} : X^K \\times Y^K \\times X \\rightarrow \\Delta(X \\rightarrow Y)\\), which we can write as a conditional distribution \\(i_{\\theta}(f|X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})\\).\nTraining induction and transduction. Both types of models are trained via meta-learning. We assume a meta-learning dataset D of few-shot learning problems, each equipped with a ground-truth function f such that \\(f(x) = y\\) for every x, y in (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\)) and (\\(X_{test}\\), \\(Y_{test}\\)). Inductive and transductive models are meta-trained to minimize the following losses:\n\nTRANSDUCTION LOSS = \\(E_{(X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test}, Y_{test}, f)\\sim D}[- log t_{\\theta} (Y_{test}|X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})]\\) \\( (1)\\)\nINDUCTION LOSS = \\(E_{(X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test}, Y_{test}, f)\\sim D}[-log i_{\\theta} (f|X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})]\\)  \\((2)\\)\n\nTesting induction and transduction. After meta-learning the models encounter a test-time few-shot learning task (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\), \\(X_{test}\\)). Transductive models predict their most likely output for \\(Y_{test}\\) (approximated via beam search). Inductive models sample a test-time budget of B functions \\(f_{1}...f_{B}\\), which are filtered by (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\)), and finally used to predict \\(Y_{test} = f(X_{test})\\). Transduction and induction can be ensembled by predicting according to induction whenever at least one of the B functions fits (\\(X_{train}\\), \\(Y_{train}\\)), and otherwise using transduction (which does not need to build an explicit function). Writing \\(\\hat{y}_{test}\\) for the predicted test output:\n\nTRANSDUCTION: \\(\\hat{y}_{test} = \\operatorname{arg \\, max}_{y \\in Y} t_{\\theta}(y | X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})\\)  \\((3)\\)\nINDUCTION: \\(\\hat{y}_{test} \\sim \\operatorname{Uniform}(F)\\)  \\((4)\\)\nwhere \\(F = {f_{b}(X_{test}) : for 1 \\le b < B if f_{b}(X_{train}) = Y_{train}}\\)\n\\(f_{b} \\sim i_{\\theta}(f | X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test})\\)\n\nENSEMBLE: \\(\\hat{y}_{test} \\sim \\operatorname{Uniform}(F) if F \\ne \\emptyset\\)  \\((5)\\)\n\\(\\hat{y}_{test} = \\operatorname{arg \\, max}_{y \\in Y} t_{\\theta}(y | X_{train}, Y_{train}, X_{test}) if F = \\emptyset\\)\n\nInstantiating the Framework for ARC. For ARC, every input from X and output from Y is a 2D grid ranging from 1\u201330 pixels per side, with each pixel containing one of ten colors. Because ARC tasks are highly diverse yet typically have an abstract program-like structure, we represent the underlying function f as Python code, which is computationally universal, and so possible in principle of solving any ARC task. Therefore the induction model must generate Python code, so we initialize our models with Llama3.1-8B-instruct because it was pretrained on source code. We then meta-learn by further fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-instruct for induction or transduction using a synthetically-generated corpus of ARC-style problems, described next."}, {"title": "GENERATING DATASETS FOR INDUCTION AND TRANSDUCTION", "content": "Generating realistic ARC-like tasks is challenging because of the diversity of concepts that can occur in ARC. It is also challenging because we need to generate not just a function, and also inputs that serve as good examples for that function."}, {"title": "EMPIRICAL STUDY OF INDUCTION AND TRANSDUCTION", "content": "We train inductive and transductive models on synthetic ARC problems with the goal of understanding (1) how the methods compare; (2) how performance scales with train-time effort; and (3) how performance scales with test-time compute (for induction only, as it allows drawing more samples at test time to improve performance). We report performance on the 400-problem public validation split of ARC, which is significantly harder than the training split. Our systems learn from a 100-problem subset of the training split of ARC, specifically problems for which we created seeds.\nInduction and Transduction are strongly complementary. Despite training on the exact same problems, inductive and transductive models solve different ARC tasks, and neither approach is dramatically more effective than the other. And although these methods have a similar overall solve rate, most problems solved by induction are not solved by transduction, and vice versa.\nAn alternative explanation is that induction and transduction are not actually complementary, but instead that, having trained two neural networks with different random initializations, they simply solved different problems due to randomness at train or test time. To test this alternative explanation, we trained many models with different random initializations. We find that the problems solved by induction/transduction are surprisingly stable across these different runs. In other words, some problems are friendlier to induction, and others friendlier to transduction."}, {"title": "SCALING OUR METHOD", "content": "Motivated by our findings so far, we scaled our method by producing two larger datasets:\nARC-Heavy: 200k problems from 160 seeds. The purpose of ARC-Heavy is to scale our method in an easily reproducible way, while also filling any gaps in its mastery of the training split. We first ran models from Section 4 on the training split to identify 60 problems that they still struggled with, for which we produced 60 new seeds, giving 160 seeds in total. From those seeds we produced"}, {"title": "WHICH CONCEPTS ARE EASIER FOR INDUCTION OR TRANSDUCTION?", "content": "We evaluate on ConceptARC, an alternative ARC test-set which classifies its tasks into \"concept groups\" each exemplifying a single isolated high-level concept such as \"sameness\u201d or \u201cabove vs below.\u201d We use models trained on ARC-Potpourri, finding that specific concept categories are more amenable to induction or transduction. We find an intuitive division of labor between the two approaches: Concept groups such as counting are best solved with symbolic code, while transduction better handles perceptual processes such as judging whether a shape is more horizontal or more vertical, or more top/bottom."}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "The ARC dataset was originally designed to challenge conventional deep learning and spur progress on alternative paradigms. The first wave of successful ARC solvers used discrete program search over domain-specific programming languages, including the original Kaggle winner. These symbolic approaches have held their own against GPT-4, but have recently been surpassed by transductive architectures. ARC has so far resisted conventional neural and symbolic approaches, but is solvable for adult humans, and to some extent, children. We now situate our works within this broader context.\nProgram Induction. Although many recent works use LLMs for code generation, we most directly build on Li & Ellis (2024), which fine-tunes LLMs for inductive program synthesis using LLM-generated synthetic data. From an engineering standpoint, our work tackles a harder and more diverse range of problems (all of ARC, instead of simple functions on sequences). While there are many technical differences, a key factor is that we generate function inputs by synthesizing an input_generator function, rather than relying on an LLM to propose plausible inputs. This matters because an LLM alone could not generate complicated, precisely-correct inputs such as ARC grids. This also makes our work more broadly applicable across program synthesis and AI, particularly to few-shot generalization problems with complex input-spaces such as webpages, robot planning, etc.\nClassic work in neural program synthesis has previously compared induction and transduction (RobustFill: Devlin et al. (2017)). We explore here a much richer space of functions, reaching a qualitatively different conclusion than RobustFill: Instead of finding transduction inferior to induction, we find them complementary. More broadly, the transductive-inductive divide lies near the heart of supervised learning. Inductive approaches, such as linear regression, first construct a function f where \\(f(x_{train}) \u2248 Y_{train}\\), and then predict \\(Y_{test} = f(x_{test})\\). Transductive approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, instead output their predictions by performing comparisons with the training data. We use the same neural network architecture to perform both tasks, allowing a controlled comparison between these paradigms."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "To what extent is this methodology applicable beyond ARC? Few-shot function learning is a very flexible framework, but our particular method is most applicable when the target generalization can be described in symbolic code. As an immediately tangible example, web scraping and other forms of data-munging could fit within our framework. As a loftier goal, however, symbolic code is an especially good medium for articulating precise models of how the world works. This is true both within the natural sciences and also within AI, with examples such as robotic policies, planners, and world models more broadly. These are not the kinds of programs that occur often in LLM pretraining data\u2014so merely prompting is unlikely to perform well-but it is nonetheless feasible to curate around 100 seeds demonstrating what the system should learn.\nWhat we learn about robust sample-efficient generalization\u2014and how to solve ARC. Neither explicit symbolic hypotheses nor implicit neural representations suffice to solve all problems: each has their own domain of applicability, and simply ensembling models specialized in each does not cover all cases. Engineering a more clever neural program search, or training transductive predictors on more data, is unlikely to be fruitful. Instead we need representations irreducible to a purely neural or symbolic form, which intertwine inductive and transductive reasoning. One way of implementing this idea is to do program synthesis within a language whose elementary primitives are irreducibly non-symbolic, and to pretrain those primitives to encapsulate the basic atoms of core knowledge. While work has taken steps in this direction, how to engineer and scale this idea remains open.\nAre we 'cheating' by training on 400k synthetic ARC problems? The spirit of ARC is to generalize from few examples. Yet we fine-tune on many examples. In our view, the true training data is 160 seeds, not the 400k 'remixes,' which are instead analogous to 'dream data' in amortized inference or wake-sleep. In other words, our system inputs 160 annotated solutions to training set problems, and does up-front computation to convert that data into a neural network capable of solving new problems. From that perspective, it is a relatively sample efficient way of learning to solve ARC.\nFrom domain-specific languages to domain-specific libraries. Many works that perform program search rely on carefully tuned domain-specific languages instead of using a general purpose language such as Python. However, we believe general-purpose programming languages can give much broader coverage, and that attempts to engineer restricted languages inevitably sacrifice regions of program-space which could plausibly occur in open-ended learning domains such as ARC. Instead we advocate here for domain-specific libraries, which equip a general-purpose language with extra priors, but do not restrict it to using only those priors.\nHow to represent input-output mappings. Our seeds include: (1) a grid transformation program, (2) an input generator, and (3) natural language descriptions for both (1) and (2). Practically, this representation allows us to sample consistent input-output example pairs for training, while the natural language descriptions help LLMs to remix seeds into novel problems. This further captures a latent natural language description of both inputs and outputs, from which the function and its preimage are derived."}, {"title": "Next steps suggested by biological intelligence.", "content": "Our work has a straightforward analogy to dual-process models in psychology, which categorizes human thinking according to whether it relies on fast nonverbal intuitions or deliberative conscious thought. Although preliminary, our results could suggest that this partitioning is actually normative, and emerges from properties of the problems being solved, not properties of the solver itself. Human thinking is however more sophisticated in how it combines these modes: Fast intuitions can be further reprocessed by deliberative symbolic processing, which can trigger further intuitions, and so on. Our method has no analogous way of interleaving these two strategies, but more deeply integrating induction and transduction is a natural next step (as described earlier).\nOur approach can also be seen as a form of wake-sleep or dream learning where samples from a generative model train an inference network. Here the generative model is a prompt with the seeds, and the inference network is our fine-tuned models. Recent models of cortico-hippocampal interaction provide frameworks for analogous brain processes: Programs could be first generated using circuits in frontal cortex and re-encoded in the hippocampus. The hippocampus remaps/binds those programs onto so-called schemas\u2014what in program synthesis would be called abstractions\u2014which are reused across memory episodes. Finally, during sleep, the hippocampus replays new combinations of those schemas to consolidate the corresponding memories and integrate them into existing knowledge networks, analogous to training an inference network on synthetic 'dream' data. Although these potential biological analogues are admittedly speculative, drawing these analogies suggests two ways of extending our system. First, we could learn from recently-solved test problems (during \u2018waking') by generating fresh synthetic data using those problems as seeds (during \u2018dreaming/sleeping'). Second, we could also implement a form of schema-learning, which would automatically revise and expand our custom ARC library, or even add new neural primitives to that library, in the spirit of library learning and modular metalearning.\nLimitations. Our system does not grow more competent at few-shot learning by solving new problems: Instead, it bootstraps from manually encoded knowledge in the seeds, which is transformed into a few-shot learner via an LLM training/inference pipeline. A more compelling approach would be to have the system discover for itself the knowledge that we compiled for it within the seeds, for instance by practicing on training tasks, absent any ground truth solutions.\nOur work is only evaluated on ARC. However, ARC is designed to contain many concepts and problems embedded within it, so can be viewed as a composite of multiple learning benchmarks. Owing to this diversity of problems, ARC is also notoriously challenging, and has resisted solution despite a series of high-profile competitions. We therefore believe that although evaluating on multiple benchmarks is desirable, ARC is an appropriate benchmark to use as the centerpiece of an experimental evaluation."}, {"title": "DATA GENERATION TECHNICAL DETAILS", "content": null}, {"title": "SEED EXAMPLES", "content": null}, {"title": "COMMON LIBRARY", "content": null}, {"title": "EXAMPLES OF INDUCTION SOLUTIONS", "content": null}, {"title": "ARC PROBLEM F3CDC58F", "content": "from common import *\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import *\n# concepts:\n# color counting, grid transformation\n# description:\n# In the input, you will see a grid with several colored squares.\n# To make the output, count the number of squares of each color.\n# Fill the output grid with bars of corresponding colors.\n# The height of each bar corresponds to the number of squares of that\ncolor.\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n# Create a blank output grid\noutput_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n# Count the number of squares of each color\ncolor_counts = {color: 0 for color in Color.NOT_BLACK}\nfor row in input_grid:\nfor cell in row:\nif cell in color_counts:\ncolor_counts [cell] += 1\n# Define the height of the bars based on the counts\nmax_height = 10 % Maximum height of the bars\nfor color, count in color_counts.items():\nif count > 0:\nfor h in range (min (count, max_height)):\noutput_grid[-(h + 1), (color 1)%\nreturn output_grid"}, {"title": "ARC PROBLEM BE03B35F", "content": "from common import *\nimport numpy as np"}, {"title": "ARC PROBLEM 2072ABA6", "content": "from common import *\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import *\n# concepts:\n# color mapping, pattern replication\n# description:\n# In the input you will see a 3x3 grid of colored pixels.\n# The colors are either black or gray.

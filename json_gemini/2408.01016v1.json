INTRODUCTION", "content": "The importance of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs)\nhas rapidly increased as they enhance travel efficiency, re-\nduce traffic incidents, and improve safety. Traffic prediction\ninvolves predicting future traffic behavior in a given area ac-\ncording to current and past traffic conditions. This information\nis crucial for multiple purposes, such as reducing congestion,\noptimizing transportation systems, and enhancing road safety.\nWith the growing capabilities of road sensor devices, var-\nious information about traffic networks, such as flow and\nspeed, can be collected and prepared for several downstream\ntasks not only for traffic predicting, including forecasting of\ntraffic flow, travel time, and traffic density, but also other real-\nworld applications such as travel demand prediction for ride-\nhailing services, autonomous vehicles, intersection manage-\nment, parking management, urban planning, and transporta-\ntion safety [1]. Traditionally, traffic prediction has utilized\nmethods like rule-based models and time-series analysis.\nHowever, these approaches often fall short of capturing the\nfull complexity, variability of traffic patterns in graph data.\nTraffic flow prediction for a specific road is a difficult\nproblem because it is influenced by many factors, including\nthe day, time of day, weather conditions, and the traffic flow of\nneighboring roads. Thus, traffic prediction requires generating\ndata from the non-Euclidean domain, necessitating the use of\ngraph data structures to represent complex spatial relation-\nships and interdependencies between objects [2]. This task is\nparticularly challenging due to the spatiotemporal nature of\ntraffic network data, which encapsulates both intricate spatial\nrelationships and dynamic temporal dependencies [3], [4].\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) can directly process the\ngraph structure (i.e., adjacency information) along with node\n(sensors in roads) features. Numerous techniques for extract-\ning features from graphs [5]\u2013[8] have been shown to be ef-\nfective in handling graph structures, including their adjacency\ninformation. These methods enable the extraction of node\nembeddings of the graph in Euclidean space.\nPublicly available road traffic prediction datasets differ in\nseveral ways (1) size: the number of sensors or data points,\n(2) temporal coverage: how long period the data covers, (3)\nsensor metadata: information about the sensors (e.g. location,\ntype), and (4) road type: whether the data is collected on\nhighways or urban streets. One major limitation in many\npopular datasets, like METR-LA [9], is their focus on only\nhighways. This focus results in the lack of ability to recognize\nurban traffic networks successfully. Another limitation is that\nthese datasets are often scale-limited compared to real-world\nroad networks, making it harder to train complex forecasting\nmodels. For instance, METR-LA and PeMS-BAY [10], two\nof the most widely used datasets, contain only 207 and 325\nsensors, respectively. Additionally, only a few of the datasets\n[10] cover a long enough temporal period, which is crucial in\ncapturing long-term traffic patterns. Considering the impact of\ndata quality on model performance, these limitations reduce\nthe effectiveness of traffic prediction models.\nIn this study, we aim to enrich the literature by introducing\nthe IBB Traffic graph dataset, which covers 2,451 sensors\nlocated in Istanbul, Turkey, including both urban and highway\nroads. Given the features collected by sensors, this dataset can\nbe utilized not only for predicting road traffic anomalies but\nalso for forecasting speed, flow, and travel time. Moreover,\nwe propose a novel Road Traffic Prediction Model that\nstrengthens temporal links through feature engineering, node\nembedding with GLEE to represent inter-related relationships\nwithin the traffic network, and traffic prediction with Extra-\nTrees.\nThe main contributions of our study can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022\nA novel IBB traffic graph dataset comprises sensor"}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is proposed for\nhigher resolution traffic state estimation using the origin-\ndestination relationship of segment flow data between up-\nstream and downstream on the highway [11]. The perfor-\nmance of machine learning methods such as linear regression,\nRandom Forest (RF), and ARIMA is evaluated for traffic\ncongestion prediction, which is one of the vital components\nof Intelligent Transportation Systems in smart cities [12]. The\ngrowth of big data makes it possible to study traffic conges-\ntion issues through data from sensors in various locations.\nConsidering rainfall data as a traffic congestion indicator, a\nstacked generalization model suitable for big and complex\ndata using RF, CatBoost, and XGBoost algorithms is proposed\n[13]. LightGBM model proposed for Freeway Short-Term\nTravel Time Prediction is proved to be more accurate and\nhas a shorter model training time than KNN and Gradient\nBoosting Machine (GBM) [14].\nModels trained and evaluated on widely used traffic datasets\nmay not be applicable to practical scenarios due to the limited\nscale of these datasets compared to real-world traffic networks\n[10]. In other words, widely used datasets such as PeMS03,\nPeMS04, PeMS07, PeMS08, METR-LA, and PeMS-BAY [9],\n[15] contain a low number of sensors, resulting in a small\nroad network with an insufficient number of nodes. In this\nstudy, we enrich the literature by introducing the IBB Traffic\ngraph dataset, which covers 2451 sensors located in Istanbul,\nincluding both urban and highway roads."}, {"title": "III.

In addition to intra-continental traffic\nflow, millions of people travel between continents daily using\nthree different bridges connecting these continents.\nThe proposed IBB Traffic graph dataset encompasses four\nyears of traffic data, including features such as traffic state\n(e.g., flow and speed) and sensor information.

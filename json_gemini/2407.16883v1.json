This paper addresses these issues by introducing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable metadata format designed to enhance the discoverability, interoperability, and trust-worthiness of AI datasets. Croissant-RAI extends the Croissant metadata format and builds upon exist-ing responsible AI (RAI) documentation frameworks, offering a standardized set of attributes and prac-tices to facilitate community-wide adoption. Leveraging established web-publishing practices, such as Schema.org, Croissant-RAI enables dataset users to easily find and utilize RAI metadata regardless of the platform on which the datasets are published. Furthermore, it is seamlessly integrated into major data search engines, repositories, and machine learning frameworks, streamlining the reading and writing of responsible AI metadata within practitioners' existing workflows. Croissant-RAI was developed through a community-led effort. It has been designed to be adaptable to evolving documentation requirements and is supported by a Python library and a visual editor.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Data is a crucial element in emergent AI technolo-gies and plays a central role in training and evalu-ating models. Recent research has emphasized how data can unexpectedly lead to harmful outcomes in AI applications, highlighting the real-world conse-quences of data-related issues. For instance, recent studies have revealed gender-biased AI classifiers incomputer-aided diagnosis as a direct result of imbal-ances in training data (Larrazabal et al. 2020), and issues during data collection that can cause AI appli-cations, which are designed to detect pneumonia, to fail when deployed to different hospitals (Zech et al. 2018).\nConsequently, the community focused on respon-sible AI (RAI) has identified data work as critical to the development of trustworthy AI systems (Smuha 2019; Oala et al. 2024). Seminal works, such as Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al. 2021) and Data Statements (Bender and Friedman 2018) have em-phasized the importance of dataset documentation to assess and increase the trustworthiness of AI sys-tems. Data needs to be documented, analyzed, and enriched (e.g., against biases), and maintained.\nWhile the research community has made signif-icant progress in publishing and sharing datasets, most datasets are still one-time, expensive ef-forts (Sambasivan et al. 2021). Formats for docu-menting Al data can be a rich source of information, but it is becoming increasingly clear that they need to evolve (Yang, Liang, and Zou 2024). Current pro-posals have overlapping formats, require data docu-mentation written in natural language, lack a stan-dard structure and are not integrated with widely used tools and ML frameworks, making them diffi-cult for machines to read and process.\nThis work addresses these issues by introduc-ing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable format for capturing and publishing RAI-related data docu-mentation.

The entire process has been led by commu-nity projects involving experts from various back-grounds, referred to as stakeholders below. The dif-ferent aspects of Croissant-RAI were meticulously defined using a comprehensive vocabulary engineer-ing process which was focused on iterative and par-ticipatory co-design activities. In this section, we ex-plain the process in detail, including the RAI docu-mentation frameworks that served as the foundation for developing the vocabulary. The subsequent sec-tion will discuss the use cases developed to guide the design of Croissant-RAI ensuring its usefulness and relevance to machine learning practitioners.\nFigure 1 depicts the different steps of the vocabu-lary engineering process detailed as follows:\n\u2022 Use Case Definition. The process began with biweekly sprint sessions, engaging stakeholders from various domains and levels of expertise. Through several brainstorming sessions, stake-holders identified and prioritized the attributes for the Croissant-RAI format. This collaborative approach ensured that the identified use cases were comprehensive, relevant, and aligned with the overarching goals of promoting data standardization and responsible AI practices.\n\u2022 Comparison with existing dataset documen-tation vocabularies. In this phase, existing dataset documentation vocabularies were thor-oughly examined to identify overlaps and gaps in relation to the Croissant vocabulary, i.e. the attributes. An overview of these vocabularies is presented in Table 1. Stakeholders were engaged in comparative analyses and discussions to as-sess the suitability of different vocabularies for integration with Croissant-RAI.\n\u2022 Scope Definition. Through participatory co-design activities, stakeholders formulated com-petency questions to that defined the scope and requirements of the Croissant-RAI vocabulary. These questions reflected diverse perspectives and priorities, acting as guiding principles. They helped identify the key features and function-alities necessary to meet the objectives of the Croissant-RAI vocabulary.\n\u2022 Conceptualization of RAI extension and Implementation. Building on insights from co-design activities discuss above, the conceptual framework for the Croissant-RAI vocabulary was defined on top of Croissant. Through col-laborative modeling sessions, concept mapping exercises, and scenario-based discussions, we en-sured that the Croissant-RAI vocabulary aligned with use cases, stakeholder priorities and did not overlap or contradiction with the Croissant format. Moreover, in biweekly sprint cycles a conceptual model of the Croissant-RAI vocabu-lary as developed. This facilitated an integration of Croissant-RAI with Croissant and ensured compatibility with existing functionalities.\n\u2022 Evaluation through example annotations for each use case. To ensure the effectiveness and usability of the Croissant-RAI metadata format, stakeholders engaged in participatory evaluation activities. This included annotating sample datasets using the implemented features and gathering feedback from users to identify any usability issues or areas for improvement.\nThroughout each of these steps, participatory co-design activities played a pivotal role in ensuring that the features of Croissant-RAI were aligned with the needs and perspectives of diverse stakeholders.

During several brain-storming sessions, stakeholders identified and pri-oritized the five use cases presented in this sec-tion. The collaborative approach ensured that the identified use cases were comprehensive, relevant, and aligned with the overall goals of promoting data standardization and responsible AI practices. The presented use cases are intended to be a represen-tative sample, but more may be added in the future.\nThe initial use cases are centered on document-ing the data life cycle, characterizing in-depth data labeling and data participatory processes, and pro-viding critical information for Al safety and fairness assessments and regulatory compliance checks. A more detailed explanation is provided below.\nUse case 1: The data life cycle. The dataset life cycle involves stages like motivation, compo-sition, collection, preprocessing, uses, distribution, and maintenance. Documenting RAI-related prop-erties prompts creators to reflect on the process and aids user understanding. Information includes: creator, purpose, creation date, data sources, ver-sioning, composition, processing, intended use, and maintenance. Documentation of the provenance and lineage of the datasets that are derived from revi-sion, modification or extension of existing datasets is also relevant for this use case.\nUse case 2: Data labeling. Labels plays a central role in dataset for AI and can be obtained through human input such as labels from crowdsourcing plat-forms, or machine annotations like concept extrac-tion. Details such as the platform used, number of human labels per record, rater demographics, and annotation tool characteristics aid in understanding dataset composition and facilitate efficient sampling. Information on the labeling process enhances com-prehension of data creation, sample characteristics, and aids in assessing, replicating, and reproducing the process, thereby boosting data reliability.\nUse case 3: Participatory data.

The GeoAI datasets are cu-rated from data captured by various sensors on-board spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms along with the in-situ sensors. With the ever rising significance of location-based analysis and the in-creasing size of the generated data, GeoAI plays an important role in solving complex and crucial prob-lems like weather forecasting. However, Geospatial datasets also involve ethical considerations in the ac-quisition and utilization of geospatial data, address-ing potential biases, environmental impact, and pri-vacy concerns.\nFor instance, location accuracy and spatial prop-erties are vital to the credibility of GeoAI-ready datasets. Changes in local accuracy can have an im-pact on AI predictions. For example, in AI-based crop yield prediction tasks, ground truth for validating the AI model is typically obtained from agricultural farms. However, due to privacy concerns, these an-notations are often approximated, which can result in inaccurate predictions and estimates of AI models."}, {"title": "Diversity In Conversational AI Evaluation for Safety", "content": "With the increasing rise in development of the LLMs, it is crucial to assess the LLMs for in-clusiveness and FAIRness in an operational sce-nario (Vidgen et al. 2024).

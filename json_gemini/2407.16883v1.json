This paper ad-dresses these issues by introducing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable metadata format designed to en-hance the discoverability, interoperability, and trust-worthiness of AI datasets. Croissant-RAI extends the Croissant metadata format and builds upon exist-ing responsible AI (RAI) documentation frameworks, offering a standardized set of attributes and prac-tices to facilitate community-wide adoption. Lever-aging established web-publishing practices, such as Schema.org, Croissant-RAI enables dataset users to easily find and utilize RAI metadata regardless of the platform on which the datasets are published. Furthermore, it is seamlessly integrated into major data search engines, repositories, and machine learning frameworks, streamlining the reading and writing of responsible AI metadata within practitioners' exist-ing workflows. Croissant-RAI was developed through a community-led effort. It has been designed to be adaptable to evolving documentation requirements and is supported by a Python library and a visual editor.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Data is a crucial element in emergent AI technolo-gies and plays a central role in training and evalu-ating models. Recent research has emphasized how data can unexpectedly lead to harmful outcomes in AI applications, highlighting the real-world conse-quences of data-related issues. For instance, recent studies have revealed gender-biased AI classifiers in computer-aided diagnosis as a direct result of imbal-ances in training data (Larrazabal et al. 2020), and issues during data collection that can cause AI appli-cations, which are designed to detect pneumonia, to fail when deployed to different hospitals (Zech et al. 2018).\nConsequently, the community focused on respon-sible AI (RAI) has identified data work as critical to the development of trustworthy AI systems (Smuha 2019; Oala et al. 2024). Seminal works, such as Datasheets for Datasets (Gebru et al. 2021) and Data Statements (Bender and Friedman 2018) have em-phasized the importance of dataset documentation to assess and increase the trustworthiness of AI sys-tems. Data needs to be documented, analyzed, and enriched (e.g., against biases), and maintained.\nWhile the research community has made signif-icant progress in publishing and sharing datasets, most datasets are still one-time, expensive ef-forts (Sambasivan et al. 2021). Formats for docu-menting Al data can be a rich source of information, but it is becoming increasingly clear that they need to evolve (Yang, Liang, and Zou 2024). Current pro-posals have overlapping formats, require data docu-mentation written in natural language, lack a stan-dard structure and are not integrated with widely used tools and ML frameworks, making them diffi-cult for machines to read and process.\nThis work addresses these issues by introduc-ing Croissant-RAI, a machine-readable format for capturing and publishing RAI-related data docu-mentation.

The presented use cases are intended to be a represen-tative sample, but more may be added in the future.\nThe initial use cases are centered on document-ing the data life cycle, characterizing in-depth data labeling and data participatory processes, and pro-viding critical information for Al safety and fairness assessments and regulatory compliance checks.

The GeoAI datasets are cu-rated from data captured by various sensors on-board spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms along with the in-situ sensors. With the ever rising significance of location-based analysis and the in-creasing size of the generated data, GeoAI plays an important role in solving complex and crucial prob-lems like weather forecasting. However, Geospatial datasets also involve ethical considerations in the ac-quisition and utilization of geospatial data, address-ing potential biases, environmental impact, and pri-vacy concerns.\nFor instance, location accuracy and spatial prop-erties are vital to the credibility of GeoAI-ready datasets. Changes in local accuracy can have an im-pact on AI predictions. For example, in AI-based crop yield prediction tasks, ground truth for validating the AI model is typically obtained from agricultural farms. However, due to privacy concerns, these an-notations are often approximated, which can result in inaccurate predictions and estimates of AI models."}, {"title": "Diversity In Conversational AI Evaluation for Safety", "content": "With the increasing rise in development of the LLMs, it is crucial to assess the LLMs for in-clusiveness and FAIRness in an operational sce-nario (Vidgen et al. 2024).

The BigScience workshop, a year-long international and interdisci-plinary effort with the primary goal of investigating and training large language models, has led one of these efforts focusing on ethical considerations, po-tential harm, and governance issues.\nAs a result, they generated the BigScience Roots Corpus (Lauren\u00e7on et al. 2022), a large-scale dataset collected from multiple sources that helped to train the BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual (BLOOM) language model, which has 176 billion parameters.

The design of the vocabulary has been derived through relevant RAI use cases and illustrated in real examples from important domains and datasets. Finally, we expand the current Crois-sant toolkit, implementing the Croissant-RAI exten-sion to aid the community in its adoption.\nIn future work, we aim to track the commu-nity's uptake of the Croissant-RAI vocabulary, offer-ing valuable insights into its real-world application. Moreover, we recognize the socio-technical dimen-sions of RAI practices and underscore the impor-tance of collaborating with both public and private partners. Through active engagement with regula-tors and corporations, we can not only promote the widespread adoption of RAI methodologies but also ensure their responsible implementation. We main-tain that institutions should contemplate integrating RAI benchmarks, such as the one outlined in this pa-per, into their frameworks to foster responsible AI practices."}]}

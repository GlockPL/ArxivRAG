This corresponds to a purely utilitarian view and does not involve any fairness consideration, as the resulting network will typically benefit the capital city and/or large central cities while leaving some peripheral cities behind. On the other hand, a more egalitarian view will allow some people to travel between peripheral cities without having to go through a central city.

In the past few years, there has been a significant shift in some parts of the world, with many people choosing train travel over flying for intra-continental trips. 2021 was the European Year of Rail, an initiative dedicated to promoting the use of train travel and how it can help Europe become carbon-neutral by 2050. Key to this goal is developing a railway network that prioritises minimising travel times for most users, subject to budget constraints.\nOur aim in this paper is to contribute to this goal by leveraging notions of collective welfare from social choice, and combinatorial optimisation techniques. For this, we need to define a general model showing a trade-off between simplicity and realism. We propose a model for fair railway network design, with a parameterized collection of collective welfare functions, ranging from utilitarianism to egalitarianism, and to evaluate the impact of the fairness parameter on the shape of the re-sulting network. Assuming that each individual wants to travel between two cities, the cost incurred to an agent (an inhabitant) given a network is the shortest distance (assumed to be proportional to travel time) in the network between these two cities. These costs will be aggregated by a collective welfare function.\nUsing the notion of collective welfare enables us to be more precise in what we mean when we say \"minimis-ing travel times for most users\". How do we aggregate the costs for individuals to define network optimality? A first idea would be minimising the sum of costs, which is known as an utilitarian approach. Utilitarianism is well-known to sacrifice some individuals (giving them a very high cost) against slightly decreasing the cost of a signif-icantly larger number of individuals. The social choice literature argues for other ways of measuring social wel-fare, such as egalitarianism (minimising the maximum cost over all agents) or notions that fall between util-itarianism and egalitarianism. For this we consider a well-studied family of fairness measures, known as sum of powers: p being a parameter in {1,2,..., +\u221e}, if $c_i$ is the cost incurred by agent i, then the sum of powers aggregation of $(c_1,..., c_n)$ is\n$\\sum_{i \\in N} c_i^p)^{1/p}$ if p is finite,\nand $max_{i \\in N} c_i$ if p = +\u221e, where N is the set of agents.\nIt is reasonable to assume that utilitarianism will lead to networks that are more centralized, building more lines from/to cities that are bigger and more central, and neglecting peripheral, less populated cities (no-tably, by requiring people to travel between two periph-eral cities to go through a central city), while more egal-itarian criteria may lead to more balanced and less cen-tralized networks, less detrimental to peripheral cities. For this, we posit a series of hypotheses, which we will then try to validate or invalidate on real-world data.\nHypothesis 1 More egalitarian criteria result in more balanced networks. For this, we will consider well-known inequality indices, parameter p.\nHypothesis 2 Everything else being equal, more cen-tral cities are better connected than peripheral cities, and the difference is less marked when p increases.\nObtaining a more balanced network is more fair: peo-ple living in the periphery should not feel they lose hours of travel in order to give a small gain to those living in the capital city. People living in the capital city are often used to train travel, and gaining a few minutes on each possible trip may not radically change their behaviour. On the other hand, people living in a peripheral mid-size city may not be as accustomed to train travel, and new lines to/from that city are more likely to have a significant impact. Therefore, we posit that being more egalitarian may lead to more people choosing the train, and therefore lower carbon emis-sions."}, {"title": "Related work", "content": "Railway network design has been long studied in transportation economics and is known to be more complex than road network design because of its huge construction costs and the need to plan globally (Yi 2017). The design of a network typically relies on ef-ficiency criteria (de Rus Mendoza 2012), such as market share, but not always (regional lines, for instance, often incur a deficit, are subsidised, and aim at reducing in-equalities between territories). Transportation studies also aim at measuring the impact of factors that influ-ence the choice of transportation (e.g., (Buehler 2011; D\u00fctschke, an Anna Theis, and Hanss 2022)). Important determinants include price, travel duration and com-plexity, frequency, railway density, and past behaviour (D\u00fctschke, an Anna Theis, and Hanss 2022).\nFor the case when p = 1, the problem has been stud-ied from the algorithmic point of view under the name Optimal Network Problem: given a weighted graph and a budget, we look for a subgraph with a weight not ex-ceeding the budget minimising the sum of weights of the shortest paths between all vertex pairs. This problem is shown to be NP-hard (Johnson, Lenstra, and Kan 1978) and different methods for solving it have been proposed (Dionne and Florian 1979; Boffey and Hinxman 1979) Approximating the problem better than n\u00b9-\u20ac is also NP-hard, where n is the number of cities (Wong 1980).\nSocial choice theory has a long history of evaluating solutions to collective decision problems by aggregating individual utilities by collective utility functions. Two well-known such functions are the utilitarian and egali-tarian aggregation functions; some functions in between show a good balance between efficiency and fairness, such as Nash social welfare (for positive utilities), or sums of powers (Moulin 2004, Chap. 3).\nAn emerging field within in computational social choice is participatory budgeting (Aziz and Shah 2021; Rey and Maly 2023): given a set of candidate projects with individual costs, a maximal budget, and the pref-erences expressed by the citizens through votes, a sub-set of the project whose global costs does not exceed the budget should be selected in a fair way. Our prob-lem seems to fall into this category (identifying projects with lines), and to some extent it does indeed, but with a major specificity: individual preferences over lines are not expressed directly and independently, but a set of lines is evaluated implicitly by the travel time it induces on the individual, making the evaluation of a set of lines by an agent highly non-additive. While there have been approaches to participatory budgeting with project in-teractions (Jain, Sornat, and Talmon 2020; Jain et al. 2021; Fairstein, Meir, and Gal 2021), the form of util-ity functions considered make them inapplicable to fair railway network design.\nFinding a fair collective spanning tree connecting a set of nodes given an input graph has been investigated (Darmann, Klamler, and Pferschy 2009; Galand, Perny, and Spanjaard 2010; Darmann, Klamler, and Pferschy 2011; Escoffier, Gourv\u00e8s, and Monnot 2013), with a ma-jor difference with our work: preferences bear over in-dividual edges (and not over shortest paths)."}, {"title": "Outline of the paper", "content": "In Section 2 we present our model.

We have a set of cities C, with |C| = n; each city $C_i \\in C$ has a pop-ulation $p_i$. Further, $E \\subset {{i, j} | i,j \\in C}$ is a set of undirected edges between cities, with |E| = m, repre-senting the possible direct lines that can be built. Each edge (i, j) in the E has an associated weight $l_{i,j}$ repre-senting the distance between the cities. We assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the cost of building a direct line between i and j, and the travel duration along this line, are both proportional to $l_{i,j}$. For $(i, j) \\in E$, when no direct line has been built between i and j, it is also possible to travel between i and j at cost $Kl_{i,j}$, where K > 1 is a constant. This is intended to express that in this case, agents may take a bus or private car along this line; this allows to output disconnected networks. Setting $K= \\infty$ forces the network to be connected. For any pair of cities i, j, we define the demand function T for trips between them as follows:\n$T_{i,j}: C \\times C \\rightarrow N$,\nwhere $T_{ij}$ denotes the number of people who need to commute between i and j. We require that demand is symmetric. In other words, we have that $T_{i,j} = T_{j,i}$. Finally, we have a budget B, which is the amount of money available to construct any potential network."}, {"title": "Simplifying Assumptions", "content": "In reality, railway construction as well as traveller pref-erences and costs depend on a huge number of variables. This means that we must make several simplifying as-sumptions in our model, in order to get off the starting line. Before proceeding further, we will discuss some of the main assumptions that we make in this paper.\nAlthough real-world railway costs may vary depend-ing on whether the line being built is a high-speed rail or not, here we consider only one type of line. We also require the cost of construction of a line between any two cities to be proportional to the distance between them. Again, this may not be the case in all real-world cases, for example, when geography prohibits the con-struction of a straight line.\nWe assume there is no preexisting railway network, which, while realistic in some cases, certainly does not model how all railway networks are built. We also as-sume the budget is fixed and must be spent in one go.\nPopulation Needs and Costs We assume that each citizen is interested only in commuting between two cities and that everyone commutes with the same fre-quency. While complexities such as population hetero-geneity, the evolution of needs, and predicted behaviour of users (e.g., how many will choose to travel by train between cities A and B if the travel time is 4 hours compared to a one-hour flight?) are a factor in real life, we do not consider them here.\nWe assume the time for an agent to travel along the edge (i, j) is equal to $d_{i,j}$ (we ignore the proportionality factor) if there is a direct line between them, and $K.d_{i,j}$ otherwise: we can think of this as the cost of taking a bus or driving along the edge (i, j), rather than taking an indirect route via train. Finally, the cost of travelling from a city i to a city j is the weight of the shortest path between them. (This implicitly means that we ignore changes in lines, the cost in time and comfort associated with them, and the cost of switching from train to bus.)"}, {"title": "Travel Times", "content": "The travel time, or travel cost, for an agent is the time needed to travel between their chosen pair of cities.

The Op-timal Network Problem is known to be (strongly) NP-complete (Johnson, Lenstra, and Kan 1978). We will show that this remains true for all values of p.\nProposition 1. For any fixed p\u2208 N\u207a \u222a {+\u221e}, the p-railway design problem is strongly NP-complete.\nProof sketch. Membership in NP is straightforward. For hardness, we reduce from SAT and provide a de-tailed proof in Appendix A. The main idea is to create clause cities, literal cities, and a distinguished capital city. There are edges between each clause city and the cities corresponding to literals in it, and between each literal city and the capital. The distances and the con-struction budget are set so that all clauses can be di-rectly connected to their literals, and exactly half of the literals can be directly connected to the capital. The de-mand and the target social cost are chosen such that a network is a solution if and only if every clause can reach the capital city in exactly two steps.\nNot only is the exact optimization problem hard, but for p = 1, it is also NP-hard to approximate within n\u00b9-\u20ac (Wong 1980). These are bad news; however, we still need to solve the problem in practice to analyze some networks. To this end, we will follow two parallel approaches:\n\u2022 For large networks, since it is impractical to develop an exact algorithm, we use a heuristic algorithm based on local search, with a sophisticated initial-ization step that includes edges with high marginal contributions to decreasing social cost.\n\u2022 For small networks (up to 13 cities), we use an ex-act optimization algorithm based on tree search with constraints encoded in Answer Set Programming.\nWe will use the exact algorithm to validate the heuristic algorithm by comparing the solutions it provides for up to 13 cities with the optimal solutions. We begin by describing the local search algorithm."}, {"title": "Local Search Algorithm", "content": "The local search algorithm is composed of three stages:\n1. preprocessing: edges that are not promising are fil-tered out, resulting in a subset of edges $E^*$.\n2. generation of the initial network: $E^*$ is further re-duced by filtering out more edges until a feasible network $R_0$ is obtained.\n3. local search improvements: starting from $R_0$, a series of local improvements is made by replacing a small number of edges in the current network R with an-other small number of edges from $E^*$. The process stops when a local optimum $R^*$ is reached.\nStages 1 and 2 are based on a heuristic function called the marginal contribution of edges. The p-marginal con-tribution of an edge between two cities, given a network, is the p-social cost increase resulting from excluding the edge from the network: for each edge e, we define\n$MC(e, R, p) = \\frac{SW^p(R - {e}) - SW^p(R)}{t^{R}_{uv}}$\nwhere R-{e} is the network obtained by removing edge e from network R.\nWhen p = 1, marginal contribution is similar to the y-values defined by Boffey and Hinxman (1979) (for a different purpose), with a key difference: y-values are computed only by considering agents who travel along an edge e and ignoring other agents (who can still ben-efit from e). In other words, y-values (resp. marginal contributions) have a local (resp. global) flavour.\nIntuitively, an edge has a large marginal contribu-tion when the travel demand between the cities it links is high, and there exists no short alternate route be-tween them. Edges with a small marginal contribution are likely to be less important and are therefore consid-ered first for deletion."}, {"title": "Exact Algorithm", "content": "This algorithm takes as input an instance of the rail-way design problem and outputs an optimal network for a fixed value of p. Before the search, a preprocess-ing step ranks all edges (pairs of cities) according to their marginal contribution. The algorithm maintains a current optimal network R* (the minimal cost feasi-ble network found so far) together with its cost c*, and repeatedly uses the following improvement subroutine:\ngiven an instance and a cost c*, find a feasible solution with a cost strictly smaller than c*, until no further im-provements are possible. This subroutine is based on a brute-force search with pruning, leveraging constraint propagation using answer set programming (ASP) (Lif-schitz 2008). The feasible solutions with a cost less than c* coincide with the models of the ASP program.\nThe ASP solver branches on logical variables cor-responding to edges, using a domain ordering heuris-tic (Gebser et al. 2013): it branches on edge inclusion in the network, starting from the edge with the high-est marginal contribution down to the edge with the least marginal contribution, as identified in preprocess-ing. The program comprises (1) constraints to eliminate over-budget models (those including too many edges) and (2) constraints to eliminate over-cost networks. Constraints of type (1) are expressed with aggregators, while constraints of type (2) are enforced on the fly with a theory propagator (Gebser et al. 2016). When-ever the solver identifies a solution candidate RCE (corresponding to a leaf of the search tree), the propa-gator computes its social cost. If it is less than c*, then R is indeed a solution, and the subroutine concludes. Otherwise the propagator adds Ve as a new clause to the logic program. This new constraint eliminates R and any subset of R. The cost of any network thus eliminated would have been no smaller than c* because the social cost is non-decreasing with respect to edge deletion."}, {"title": "Experimental Validation", "content": "For the implementation of the local search algorithm, we first run the algorithm with madd = 1 and mdel = 2 to obtain a medium-quality network R'.

In the first run, the network converges to a local optimum with a faster running time, while in the second run, the network converges to a better local optimum with a slower running time.\nWe demonstrate that the local search algorithm is close to the optimum (as given by the exact algorithm) for a small number of cities and, as expected, is more scalable.

We assume that the number of people who want to commute between any two cities is proportional to the product of their population divided by the distance be-tween them; this is a known reasonable demand model (starting with (Zipf 1946)).

The Gini index is a statistical tool that measures inequality (its formal definition is provided in Appendix B); a higher index indicates greater inequality among inhabitants and a less balanced network.\nFigure 1b shows the evolution with the available bud-get of the Gini index for the UK networks with 20 cities, for p = 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, starting from a budget just enough to build one edge to the budget that can build all edges. For all countries, the Gini index not only tends to decrease asymptotically with the budget for all values of p, but the differences between different values of p also tend to vanish. This is because large budgets lead to near-optimal networks, which are already quite egal-itarian even for p = 1. When the budget is sufficient to build all edges, the Gini index for different values of p converges to the same value, which we refer to as the baseline. This baseline is independent of both p and K, and is thus specific to each country.\nWe observe that larger values of p lead to less inequal-ity (lower Gini index), which was expected. More sur-prising, however, is the observation (consistent across all countries) that the curve for p = 1,2 almost always stays above the baseline, while the curve for p = 4, 6, 10 almost always remains below it. We currently do not have a clear explanation for this phenomenon.\nAn exciting output consists of the different networks obtained for some countries when the budget or p varies. Space prevents us from giving a variety of examples so we pick one country (France) and one budget (2890) and show the networks obtained for p = 1, 4, and 10.\nWe give a few comments on the three networks de-picted in Figure 2. We observe that for p = 1, Paris (by far the largest city) is a hub, and when p increases, the number of direct lines to Paris decreases and the new hub becomes Clermont-Ferrand, making the net-work more fair by allowing better connections between Northwest and Southeast and between Northeast and Southwest. Building expensive lines allowing this (such as Clermont-Nantes or Clermont-Nancy) is made at the expense of connectedness: cities that are close to a well-connected city such as Rouen (close to Paris), Saint-Etienne or Grenoble (close to Lyon) are now discon-nected to the rest of the network and have to commute via Paris or Lyon. This behaviour is somewhat specific to the choices of a small budget B (which implies that a fully connected network tends to be a spanning tree, as is the case for p = 1) and a moderate value of K (= 3), allowing people commuting to/from disconnected cities near well-served cities to be still well-satisfied. With a smaller value of K and a small budget, we would ob-serve more disconnections (even for p = 1) and for large values of K, the network tends to be connected for all values of p."}, {"title": "The Influence of Centrality", "content": "We now turn to Hypothesis 2.

For each sampled budget B we determine the optimal network $R_p(B)$ and compute $AC(i, R_p(B))$; The varying-budget av-erage cost VAC(i) of i is the average of the values $AC(i, R_p(B))$ obtained for the 300 sample budgets.\nNow, we define the remoteness of a city as follows (the more remote a city, the less central it is):\n$Re(c) = \\frac{\\sum_{i\\in C\\{c\\}} l_{c,i}}{|C|-1}$\nFigure 1c shows how the average commuting cost VAC(i) varies with remoteness for different values of p in Brazil. We observe that (1) central cities tend to have lower average commuting costs for all values of p (which was of course expected) and, more interestingly, that (2) this advantage decreases with p (lower p value favours the central cities, while higher p value favours the less central cities), which is consistent with Hypoth-esis 2.

For any fixed p\u2208 N+ U {+\u221e}, the p-railway design problem is strongly NP-complete.\nProof. We give a polynomial reduction from the NP-hard problem 3-SAT. An instance I = (X, D) of 3-SAT is a set of Boolean variables X such that |X| = n, and a collection of clauses D such that |D| = m, where a clause is a disjunction of exactly 3 literals taken from X (a variable or a negation of a variable). The 3-SAT problem asks whether there exists an assignment of each variable of X such that each clause is satisfied.\nGiven an instance I of 3-SAT, we build an instance of the decision version of the p-railway design problem as I = (C, E, l,\u03c4, \u0392, K, SW) as follows (see Figure 3). We define k = mn+2n + 1.\n$C = {Ux, Px, Nx | x \\in X} \\cup {Cd | d \\in D} \\cup {a}$\n$E = {(a, px), (a, nx), (Ux, Px), (Ux,nx) | x \\in X} \\cup {(Cd, px) | d\\in D, x \\in d} \\cup {(cd, nx) | d\\in D, \\neg{x} \\in d}$\n$le = \\begin{cases} k \\text{  for } e\\in {(a,px), (a, nx) | x \\in X} \\\\\n1 \\text{  for } e\\in E \\ {(a,px), (a, nx) | x \\in X} \\end{cases}$\n$Te = \\begin{cases} 1 \\text{  for } e\\in {(a, vx), (a, ca) | x \\in X, d \\in D} \\\\\n0 \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}$\nB = 2n + 3m + nk\nK = +\u221e\n$SW = (m + n)^{1/p}(k + 1)$\nInformally, we have a classical incidence graph of the 3-SAT instance. We add moreover a vertex for each vari-able, connected to both its literals. We also add a vertex a, connected to all literal vertices, but with a high cost. The demands are only from vertex a to all clause ver-tices and from a to all variable vertices. The budget is set-up such that all edges of weight 1 can be built (2n+3m) in addition to one edge from a to exactly one literal for each variable (kn). Note that when p is set to +\u221e, SW equals k + 1.\nWe claim that I is satisfiable if and only if there is aRCE respecting the budget B and having a social cost of at most SW.\nAssume that I = (X, D) is satisfiable and let f be an assignment to the variables of X. We build RCE as follows: add all edges with le = 1, and add the edge (a,px) if f(x) is true, otherwise add the edge (a,nx). One can easily check that it costs exactly 2n + 3m + kn = B. The social cost for each demand (a, vx),x \u2208 X is of (k + 1) (with path going through either px or nx according to the assignment of x), and for each (a, ca), d\u2208 D is of (k + 1)\u00b2, with a path going through one literal satisfying d, which exists since I is satisfiable. Therefore, the total social cost is $(m(k + 1)\u00b2 + n(k + 1)^p)^{1/p}$ = SW\nFor the reverse direction, assume that RCE is a solution to J. First, observe that the length of a path between all pairs of cities with positive demand is at least k + 1, and that it is also the maximum possible length in order to respect SW \u2013 therefore, the length of this path must be exactly k+1 in any positive solution. From the previous observation, we can deduce that for every demand (a, vx), x \u2208 X, we must have exactly one of the edges (a, px), (a, n), x \u2208 X. Indeed, having none would gives a path of length strictly greater than k + 1 and thus exceed the social cost SW and having both would exceed the budget. Therefore, we can assign x to True if (a, px) \u2208 R, and x to False otherwise.\nFor the demands (a,ca), d \u2208 D, the length of the corresponding path must also be k+1, which is possible if and only if there is an edge (a,lx) in the solution, for some literal lx \u2208 d. By our previous assignment of the variables, such path exists only if the assignment satisfies the clause.\nSince all weights are at most k, which is polynomially bounded by the size of the SAT formula, it concludes the claimed result of strong NP-hardness."}, {"title": "Gini index", "content": "The Gini index (Gini 1936) is a statistical tool that measures economic inequality between individuals in a group (such a country or a region).

The Gini index of a network R under instance I defined as follow:\n$G = \\frac{\\sum_{1<i<j<n} \\sum_{1<k<l<n} |t_{i,j}^R - t_{k,l}^R| T_{i,j} T_{k,l}}{2\\sum_{1<i<j<n} \\sum_{1<k<l<n} t_{k,l}^R t_{i,j}T_{k,l}}$\nThe values of the Gini index range from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (extreme inequality).\nWe give below the figures for all 9 countries consid-ered, that show the evolution if the Gini index or the output network with a budget varying from small to large, and for different values of the fairness parameter p: Figures 4a for Brazil, 4b for Canada, 4c for France, 4d for Germany 4e for Italy 4f for Russia 4g for Spain 4h for the UK, and 4i for the USA."}, {"title": "Worst-best ratio", "content": "The Gini index is not the only way to measure how un-equal the network is. In particular, if the network is fair to almost all cities, except for one or two cities that are extremely disadvantaged, then the Gini index will be reasonably low, although the network is arguably not fair. Another way of measuring inequality consists sim-ply of computing the ratio between"}]}

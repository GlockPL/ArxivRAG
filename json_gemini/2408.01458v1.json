In this paper, we crit-\nically examine the state of human participant surveys associ-\nated with these topics. Through both a reflexive analysis of a\nsurvey pilot spanning six countries and a systematic literature\nreview of 44 papers featuring public surveys related to AI, we\nexplore prominent perspectives and methodological nuances\nassociated with surveys to date. We find that public surveys\non AI topics are vulnerable to specific Western knowledge,\nvalues, and assumptions in their design, including in their\npositioning of ethical concepts and societal values, lack suf-\nficient critical discourse surrounding deployment strategies,\nand demonstrate inconsistent forms of transparency in their\nreporting. Based on our findings, we distill provocations and\nheuristic questions for our community, to recognize the lim-\nitations of surveys for meeting the goals of engagement, and\nto cultivate shared principles to design, deploy, and interpret\nsurveys cautiously and responsibly.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u00b9 and Machine Learning (ML) re-\nsearchers, developers, and policymakers are increasingly us-\ning surveys to capture people's values, perceptions, and ex-\nperiences, to inform development and governance of AI.\nSurveys are used to guide the design and development of\nnew technology directions and products (e.g., Alkhathlan\net al. 2024; Sindermann et al. 2021; Persson, Laaksoharju,\nand Koga 2021; Othman 2023; Loefflad and Grossklags\n2024; Davani et al. 2024), shape companies' technology\npolicies (Anthropic 2023; Google 2024; OpenAI 2023), and"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Modern-day survey methods emerged from a long history\nof societies that sought measurements of their populations\nthrough censuses to make plans essential to core governance\n(e.g., managing food supplies, distributing land, and manag-\ning taxation)-dating back to ancient times (Rossi, Wright,\nand Anderson 2013; Midena and Yeo 2022). As the fo-\ncus of studies became more specific, such as examining the\neconomic status of households or conducting consumer re-\nsearch, surveys gained increased popularity over traditional\nsmall-scale experimental studies (Rossi, Wright, and Ander-\nson 2013). Surveys also played a prominent role in the de-\nvelopment and study of psychometrics, or measuring peo-\nple's mental activities. Important concepts in psychometrics\ninclude correlation, personality scale and psychometric reli-\nability, experimental designs, and increasingly sophisticated\nstatistical analysis (Rust and Golombok 2014).

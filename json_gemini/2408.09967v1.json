{"title": "Unsupervised Machine Learning Hybrid Approach Integrating Linear Programming in Loss Function: A Robust Optimization Technique", "authors": ["Andrew Kiruluta", "Andreas Lemos"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Introduction", "content": "Linear programming (LP) is a well-established mathematical method used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Since its formal introduction by Dantzig in 1947, LP has been widely applied across various fields, including operations research, economics, and engineering, due to its ability to optimize objectives subject to linear constraints (Dantzig, 1951; Bazaraa et al., 2013). However, traditional LP approaches have certain limitations, particularly in dealing with non-linear, high-dimensional, and dynamic environments where relationships among variables are complex and non-linear (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997).\nBy contrast, machine learning (ML) methods, especially deep learning, have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling complex patterns and making predictions based on large datasets (LeCun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016). Despite these strengths, ML models often lack the explicit interpretability and rigorous constraint satisfaction that LP offers (Rudin, 2019). This has motivated researchers to explore hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of LP and ML, aiming to develop models that are both interpretable and powerful in their predictive capabilities.\nThis paper proposes a novel hybrid method that integrates LP within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By embedding LP constraints directly into the ML framework, this approach not only maintains the interpretability and constraint satisfaction of LP but also leverages the flexibility and learning capacity of ML. This integration is"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "particularly beneficial in unsupervised or semi-supervised settings, where traditional LP methods may struggle to provide robust solutions due to the lack of labeled data (Amos & Kolter, 2017)."}, {"title": "2.1 Linear Programming and Its Applications", "content": "Linear programming has been a cornerstone in optimization theory since its inception. The primary objective of LP is to maximize or minimize a linear objective function subject to a set of linear equality and inequality constraints. The general form of an LP problem can be expressed as:\nMaximize (or Minimize):\nsubject to:\nAx < b, x \u2265 0\nwhere c is the coefficient vector of the objective function, A is the matrix representing the coefficients of the constraints, b is the vector of constraints, and x represents the decision variables.\nLP has found extensive applications in various fields, including resource allocation, production planning, transportation, and finance (Dantzig & Thapa, 2003; Bazaraa et al., 2013). Despite its wide applicability, LP is inherently limited to linear relationships, which may not adequately capture the complexities of real-world problems where relationships among variables are often non-linear and dynamic (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004)."}, {"title": "2.2 Machine Learning and Its Limitations", "content": "Machine learning, particularly deep learning, has revolutionized the way complex patterns and relationships are modeled in high-dimensional data spaces. By learning from data, ML models can make predictions, classify data, and identify hidden patterns without requiring explicit programming for each task (LeCun et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2016). However, the black-box nature of deep learning models poses challenges in interpretability and constraint satisfaction (Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017). Furthermore, standard ML models may struggle to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, such as optimization constraints, into their learning process (Caruana et al., 2015)."}, {"title": "2.3 Hybrid Approaches: Combining LP and ML", "content": "The integration of LP and ML has been explored in various forms, primarily focusing on supervised learning scenarios. For example, recent studies have embedded LP solvers"}, {"title": "3. Proposed Method", "content": "within neural networks, allowing the network to learn decision variables that satisfy LP constraints (Amos & Kolter, 2017; Donti et al., 2017). Such approaches typically involve differentiable optimization layers, which enable the gradients of the LP solutions to flow through the network, thus allowing the LP problem to be part of the end-to-end learning process (Agrawal et al., 2019).\nDespite these advances, the application of such hybrid approaches in unsupervised learning remains underexplored. Unsupervised learning, which involves learning patterns from unlabeled data, presents unique challenges, as there is no explicit target to guide the learning process (Bengio et al., 2013). This paper addresses this gap by introducing a method that incorporates LP constraints directly into the loss function of an unsupervised ML model, guiding the model to learn representations that not only capture the underlying structure of the data but also satisfy the given optimization constraints."}, {"title": "3.1 Model Overview", "content": "The core idea of the proposed method is to integrate the objectives and constraints of an LP problem directly into the loss function of an unsupervised ML model. This is achieved by defining a custom loss function that includes both a reconstruction loss (commonly used in unsupervised learning) and a penalty term derived from the LP constraints."}, {"title": "3.2 Loss Function Design", "content": "The proposed loss function, $L(x)$, for the unsupervised learning model is defined as:\n$L(x) = L_{reconstruction}(x, \\hat{x}) + \\lambda L_{LP}(x)$\n\u2022 Reconstruction Loss: $L_{reconstruction}(x, \\hat{x})$ measures the difference between the input data x and its reconstruction $\\hat{x}$. This term encourages the model to learn a meaningful representation of the input data.\n\u2022 LP Loss: $L_{LP}(x)$ encapsulates the constraints and objectives of the LP problem. This term penalizes the model if the generated solutions violate the LP constraints. The LP loss can be formulated as:\n$L_{LP}(x) = max(0, Ax \u2013 b)$\nwhere the penalty is applied only when the constraints are violated.\n\u2022 Regularization Parameter: $\\lambda$ controls the trade-off between the reconstruction loss and the LP loss. A higher $\\lambda$ places more emphasis on satisfying the LP constraints."}, {"title": "3.3 Training Procedure", "content": "The model is trained by minimizing the custom loss function $L(x)$. During each training iteration, the model updates its parameters to reduce both the reconstruction error and the LP violation. The gradients for the LP loss are computed using automatic differentiation, allowing the model to learn in an end-to-end fashion (Kingma & Ba, 2015).\nThis hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both LP and ML: the LP component ensures that the model respects the domain-specific constraints, while the ML component allows the model to learn from complex, high-dimensional data."}, {"title": "4.

The overall goal was create a model to optimize medical resources for maximizing the number of treated patients within staff and treatment timescales for a large medical facility.

We generated 10,000 samples to train and evaluate the model. The data was normalized using Min-Max scaling to bring all features into the [0, 1] range (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015)."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Real-World Dataset", "content": "For the real-world dataset, we used data from a hospital's scheduling and resource allocation system, where the task is to optimize the number of treatments administered under strict resource constraints.

The hybrid model was able to handle noisy and incomplete data more effectively than the conventional LP method, maintaining a high level of constraint satisfaction and low reconstruction error even under these conditions (Zhang et al., 2016)."}, {"title": "4.4 Comparison with Conventional LP Approach", "content": "The conventional LP approach, while optimal for satisfying constraints, lacks the flexibility and adaptability that the hybrid model offers. The hybrid approach not only achieves near-optimal constraint satisfaction but also benefits from the ability to learn from data and generalize to new scenarios. This makes it particularly suited for dynamic environments where traditional LP methods may struggle to adapt to changing conditions (Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis, 1997)."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "The results of these experiments demonstrate the superiority of the hybrid approach in balancing constraint satisfaction, reconstruction accuracy, and computational efficiency. By integrating LP into the loss function of an ML model, we can achieve a robust optimization framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms.\nThis paper introduced a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming into the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By combining the interpretability and constraint satisfaction of LP with the flexibility and learning capacity of ML, this method offers a robust solution for complex optimization problems. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach is effective in satisfying constraints, achieving low reconstruction error, and improving computational efficiency compared to conventional LP methods.

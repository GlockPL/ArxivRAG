The development of large MoE models in the distributed scenario encounters the problem of large communication overhead. The inter-device communication of a MoE layer can occupy 47% time of the entire model execution with popular models and frameworks. Therefore, existing methods suggest the communication in a MoE layer to be pipelined with the computation for overlapping. However, these coarse grained overlapping schemes introduce a notable impairment of computational efficiency and the latency concealing is sub-optimal. To this end, we present COMET, an optimized MoE system with fine-grained communication- computation overlapping. Leveraging data dependency analysis and task rescheduling, COMET achieves precise fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation. Through adaptive workload assignment, COMET effectively eliminates fine-grained communication bottlenecks and enhances its adaptability across various scenarios. Our evaluation shows that COMET accelerates the execution of a single MoE layer by 1.96\u00d7 and for end-to-end execution, COMET delivers a 1.71x speedup on average.

These achieve- ments demonstrate that scaling up model size can significantly enhance model capacity. However, the growth in model parameters poses substantial chal- lenges for the deployment of such giant models, as computational resources increasingly constrain model capacity [28]. To this end, Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) [29] intro- duces a sparse structure, within which only part of the parameters is activated. Instead of interacting with all parameters in dense models, MoE models allow each input to interact with only a few experts. For example, the Mixtral-8x7B model [12] comprises 45 billion parameters in total, while only 14 billion parameters are active during runtime. Nowadays, MoE has emerged as a key architecture for scaling 1"}, {"title": "2 Background and Motivation", "content": "models to trillion-plus parameters. The increase in parameter size in MoE models allows for the integration of greater amounts of information, but it poses challenges in expert placement. A typical approach is to distribute the experts across different GPUs as a single GPU cannot store all experts [13]. Consequently, during the execution of MoE layers, there is an intensive need for data exchange among GPUs. In the forward pass of several popular MoE models, the communication among devices accounts for 47% of the total execution time on average, as shown in Figure 1(a). In a distributed environment, executing an MoE layer involves data reception, expert computation, and data transmission, as depicted in in Figure 1(b). To reduce communication overhead, one effective strat- egy is to pipeline the process, overlapping commu- nication with expert computation [8, 10, 31, 32]. This approach involves partitioning input data into smaller data chunks, allowing decomposed commu- nication and computation phases to overlap. In the example in Figure 1(b), the received input data is divided into two chunks, and this coarse-grained over- lapping reduces the overall execution time relative to non-pipelined execution. The overlapping in existing mechanisms remains sub- optimal due to two primary inefficiencies. First, the efficiency of partitioned experts declines as the data chunks assigned to each expert become smaller, po- tentially leading to under-utilization of GPU compu- tational resources (e.g., the total compute time of experts after partitioning t\u2081 + t2 exceeds the original time t). The coarse-grained partitioning results in un- avoidable GPU idle time during the initial and final communication phases, such as when receiving data for chunk 1 and sending data for chunk 2, which do not overlap with computation. Consequently, mini- mizing the non-overlapping time in these phases while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. This is challenging because the data dependency between communication and computation is complex and it is hard to be overlapped in a fine-grained granular- ity efficiently. Second, due to the dynamic nature of MoE, the input shapes for experts are various at runtime, thereby posing diverse communication and computation burdens on GPUs. Encapsulating com- munication and computation tasks into separate ker- nels on different streams, like almost all the prior re- searches do, restricts control over hardware resources and results in non-deterministic kernel performance, thereby hindering seamless overlap (e.g., the compu- tation of chunk 1 and the receiving of chunk 2 are misaligned). The second challenge, therefore, is to dynamically ensure precise allocation of hardware resources between computation and communication workloads at runtime. The complex data dependency, and the dynamic computation and communication workloads in MoE impede existing systems to realize efficient communication-computation overlap. We therefore propose COMET, a system that enables fine-grained communication-computation overlapping for efficient MoE execution. COMET introduces two key designs: 1) A dependency resolving method that identifies com- plex data dependencies between communication and computation operations in MoE, enabling optimized computation-communication pipeline structuring. 2) An adaptive workload assignment method that dy- namically allocates GPU thread blocks to different workloads within a kernel, balancing communication and computation to improve latency concealment. COMET facilitates fine-grained overlapping in MoE by analyzing shared data buffers between commu- nication and computation operations, referred to as shared tensor.

As illustrated in section 1, coarse- grained overlapping of computation and communica- tion offers limited optimization potential, and kernel- level scheduling is not efficient for dynamic workloads. Thus, it is more efficient to perform the overlapping at a fine-grained granularity (such as token-wise) and integrates computation and communication work- loads into fused GPU kernels. Adopting such a finer- grained overlapping could extremely unleash further optimization opportunities. However, achieving such fine-grained overlapping in MoE is non-trivial and there are two primary obstacles in our observation."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Granularity mismatch between computation and communication", "content": "In MoE systems, the token serves as the fundamental unit of data movement, illustrated by the movement of Token A in Figure 2. To maximize GPU compute efficiency, high-performance GEMM (GroupGEMM) kernels typically organize rows into tiles for process- ing. The purple block in Figure 2 represents such a computation tile in GEMM kernels, exemplified by a 128x128 tile. Therefore, the GEMM computations as- sociated with a single expert may require 128 tokens distributed across multiple GPUs. When fusing com- putation and communication at fine granularity, the disparity between token-level data transfer and tile- level computation introduces considerable challenges: The complex data dependency adversely affects the ef- ficiency of overlap, prompting the use of fine-grained communication, while integrating fine-grained com- munication with computation within fused kernels is also challenging. Complex data dependency. The tokens needed for each computation tile, determined by the MoE's gate at runtime, are randomly distributed across multiple devices. Computation for a tile cannot start until all required tokens are available. As shown in Figure 2, Experto's tile does not initiate processing until both Token A and Token B are received. Thus, with coarse- grained data communication, data preparation time for each computational tile may be prolonged because of this irregular and complicated data dependency. To mitigate this, we should employ fine-grained com- munication, where each computational tile reads or writes only the data it requires directly through the Unified Virtual Address [18], and leverage the data reorganization and rescheduling to hide it with com- putation efficiently. Fine-grained communication. The integration of token-wise communication with tile-wise computation for overlapping is non-trivial. Remote I/O operations between GPUs exhibit significantly higher latency compared to local GPU memory access. Therefore, executing numerous fine-grained read and write op- erations on remote data tokens within computation thread blocks can block subsequent computational tasks, leading to a significant decline in kernel effi- ciency. This challenge is especially evident in the Hop- per architecture, where computation kernels lever- age Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) hardware instructions [20] to establish asynchronous compute pipelines. The integration of long-latency remote I/O operations within these asynchronous pipelines can considerably prolong the overall execution time, ad- versely affecting performance. Thus, it is critical to constrain the impact of fine-grained communication on computation kernels. Our first insight is that resolving the granularity mismatch between computation and communication in MoE models is the key to enable efficient overlap of these two processes."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Diverse loads of computation and communication", "content": "Another characteristic of MoE is the dynamic routing of tokens to different experts, resulting in varying input shapes for experts at runtime (e.g., the token number received by Expert and Expert1 are differ- ent as shown in Figure 2). This variability imposes differing communication and computation demands on GPUs. Besides, the hardware environments can also have various compute architectures or network topologies, providing different compute capacities and communication bandwidths. Achieving seamless overlap between computation and communication thus requires dynamically adjusting the allocation of GPU resources to different workloads, which is hard to be realized through wrapping workloads into separate kernels."}, {"title": "3 Design of Comet", "content": "In this section, we present the core design of COMET, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) system optimized for efficient execution of MoE layers through pipelined execution and fine-grained overlapping of communica- tion and computation. Our analysis reveals that the MoE architecture has two distinct producer-consumer pipelines: the communication-computation pipeline and the computation-communication pipeline, as il- lustrated in Figure 3. Tokens traverse the pipelines as depicted and the operations within each pipeline are linked through a shared buffer, referred to as the shared tensor, serving as both the producer's output buffer and the consumer's input buffer. To minimize overall latency and enhance pipeline performance, COMET introduces two key mechanisms aimed at overlapping computation and communication work- loads effectively. 1. Shared tensor based dependency resolving: As previously mentioned, the intricate data dependen- cies between communication and computation pose a challenge to achieving seamless overlap between these operations. To address this, we examine the data dependencies by analyzing the shared tensor. Our analysis reveals that the shared tensor can be decomposed, and the associated computations can be rescheduled to overlap more effectively with com- munication. Accordingly, the dependency resolving process employs two key optimization strategies on the shared tensors as shown in Figure 3: \u2460 Decom- posing the shared tensors along specific dimensions to break the coarse-grained data dependencies and, \u2461 rescheduling the computations to enhance efficiency while ensuring effective overlapping. 2. Adaptive workload assignment: Following pipeline optimization by the dependency resolving, the pat- tern of communication-computation overlap becomes more consistent and regular. To effectively hide the fine-grained communication latency, it is essential to allocate appropriate hardware resources to both communication and computation workloads. Given that these workloads exhibit different performance characteristics depending on input shapes, model con- figurations, and hardware environments, the adaptive workload assignment scheme dynamically balances computation and communication. This approach gen- erates highly efficient horizontally-fused kernels for the MoE system, thereby optimizing latency conceal- ment. As shown in Figure 3, COMET first leverages the shared tensor based dependency resolving method to optimize the pipelines in the MoE structure by decomposing and rescheduling the shared tensors. According to the reformed pipelines, COMET then provides highly-efficient fused kernels through the adaptive workload assignment mechanism."}, {"title": "3.1 Shared Tensor Based Dependency Resolving", "content": "We now introduce how to resolve the complex data dependency between computation and communica- tion in MoE. It aims to bridge the granularity of communication and computation operations to sus- tain high efficiency by decomposing and rescheduling shared tensors."}, {"title": "3.1.1 How to decompose the shared tensor?", "content": "Shared tensors, as the bridge between the producer operator and the consumer operator, is the key to enable overlapping. Notably, overlapping can oc- cur only when the producer and consumer operate on independent data within the shared tensor, as illustrated in Figure 4. Thus, we analyze the access pattern of operators on the shared tensor and decom- pose it along a specific dimension where data remain independent for the consumer operator. For example, in the communication-computation pipeline in layer0, the consumer operator is a GEMM, with the shared tensor serving as its input matrix. In this case, tokens are independent with each other alongside the M (token) dimension, allowing for de- composition of the shared tensor along M. However, since the computation of a GEMM tile involves mul- tiplication and reduction along the token embedding dimension to produce the final outputs, decomposing the shared tensor along this dimension is not feasible. As for the computation-communication pipeline in layer1, the consumer operator contains a top-K reduc- tion, which reduces tokens along the M dimension, leading to significant interdependencies between to- kens along this dimension. Thus, the shared tensor can only be decomposed along the N dimension where elements are independent."}, {"title": "3.1.2 How to reschedule the decomposed shared tensor?", "content": "At the finest granularity, the shared tensor can be split into individual rows or columns, enabling the consumer to begin computation as soon as a single row or column is received. However, this level of granularity results in low computational efficiency, particularly in pipelines involving compute-intensive GEMMs, which are typically organized and processed in tiles to achieve high utilization. Therefore, after decomposing shared tensors along specific dimen- sions, the resulting sub-tensors must be reorganized and rescheduled into tiles for computation. The rescheduling of shared tensors follows two principles: Rescheduled sub-tensors should align with the orig- inal computation tile granularity for computational efficiency. The scheduling policy should prioritize portions of the producer that can be immediately used by the consumer, allowing the consumer to be- gin execution as early as possible. COMET leverages GroupGEMM to perform the com- putations for all experts on current rank. In the communication-computation pipeline (MoE layer0), the shared tensor, consumed by GroupGEMM, is decomposed along the M dimension. To enable early computation by the experts, tokens are sorted based on their source rank, as shown in Figure 5. The com- pute sequence of tiles in the GroupGEMM is then designed to minimize dependency on remote data, with computation beginning from tiles containing local tokens while the transfer of other remote tokens proceeds concurrently. In the computation-communication pipeline (MoE layer1), the shared tensor undergoes a top-k reduction after processing by the GroupGEMM of experts. As analyzed previously, the shared tensor is decomposed along the N dimension. The tile computation se- quence is adjusted (Figure 6) to enable the consumer operator to start processing before expert compu- tations are fully completed. Instead of computing each expert sequentially, GroupGEMM operations are executed column-wise. This approach allows the reduction and communicate operations to proceed as soon as the first TN columns of the shared tensors are computed. Without rescheduling, tokens could only be reduced after all experts have completed their computations."}, {"title": "3.2 Adaptive Workload Assignment", "content": "With the decomposition and rescheduling of shared tensors, the pipelines in MoE can now achieve fine- grained overlap. To ensure effective latency hiding, the durations of fine-grained communication and com- putation must be closely aligned to minimize pipeline bubbles. Achieving this requires adaptive resource allocation for both computation and communication, tailored to specific tasks involved."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Thread block specialization", "content": "A straightforward approach to achieve communication-computation overlap in Mix- ture of Experts (MoE) is to encapsulate the entire pipeline within homogeneous thread blocks, integrat- ing communication I/O into the prologue or epilogue of the computation (GEMM), a strategy referred to here as vertical fusion. Through vertical fusion, thread blocks execute concurrently, but the overlap occurs irregularly, leading to non-deterministic latencies of communication and computation, making it challenging to balance their durations for latency hiding. Furthermore, token-level fine-grained I/O in MoE can significantly reduce the computational efficiency of the underlying kernels, particularly on advanced architectures such as Hopper. To address this, we implement thread block-level isolation between communication and computation workloads. This isolation enables precise control over hardware resource allocation for each workload, facilitating a balanced distribution between computation and communication that maximizes latency hiding. Figure 7 depicts the details of the thread block spe- cialized kernel on Hopper, with the critical data path highlighted in red. Due to the isolation between communication and computation, the GEMM thread blocks in COMET utilize the same implementation as the default GEMM before fusion. In the scenario depicted in Figure 7, where the GEMM is compiled using CUTLASS on the Hopper architecture, the GEMM execution is distributed across different warps. Specifically, the producer warp loads data from global memory into a shared memory buffer with the async TMA instructions, while the consumer warp initiates tensor core MMA operations [21]. The communi- cation thread blocks subsequently read the results produced by the consumer warp from global memory. Following the top-K reduction, the warps within the communication blocks either write tokens to the local global memory or transmit them to remote destina- tions. This thread block-specialized programming model is easily portable to other architectures, such as Ampere and Volta, requiring only a substitution of the respective compute thread block implementation. Hardware resource restriction. The proposed thread block-specialized kernel is designed with the primary objective of minimizing data movement costs. How- ever, this design must also contend with hardware resource limitations. For instance, it is theoretically feasible to integrate communication warps with com- putation warps within the same thread block to elim- inate redundant global memory accesses. However, the thread number restriction of warps constrict the communication operator to fully utilize the commu- nication bandwidth. From another perspective, the warps for communication also interfere with the com- putation warps within the same thread block."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Adaptive thread block assignment", "content": "Suppose that there are n thread blocks for the fused kernel, within which np blocks serve as producers in the pipeline and nc blocks serve as consumers.

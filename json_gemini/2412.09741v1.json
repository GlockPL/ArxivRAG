Discrete image registra-\ntion can be an approach to fuse information from different sets of\nsamples of the same signal. Quantization errors in the spatial do-\nmain are inherent to digital images. We consider superresolution and\ndiscrete image registration for one-dimensional spatially-limited piece-\nwise constant functions which are subject to blur which is Gaussian\nor a mixture of Gaussians as well as to round-off errors. We describe\na signal-dependent measurement matrix which captures both types of\neffects. For this setting we show that the difficulties in determining the\ndiscontinuity points from two sets of samples even in the absence of\nother types of noise. If the samples are also subject to statistical noise,\nthen it is necessary to align and segment the data sequences to make\nthe most effective inferences about the amplitudes and discontinuity\npoints. Under some conditions on the blur, the noise, and the distance\nbetween discontinuity points, we prove that we can correctly align and\ndetermine the first samples following each discontinuity point in two\ndata sequences with an approach based on dynamic programming.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The measurement of dimensional quantities like length, distance, and size is\ncritical to the advancement of science, engineering, and technology.

Equation (2) implies that in the case of no blur we seek equal\nlength subsequences of the two data sequences under certain constraints\nwhich are each ideally noisy versions of $g_1, g_2 - g_1,... g_m - g_{m-1}, -g_m$. In\nthe case we study here, Theorem 4 implies that for each j a noisy version\nof $g_j - g_{j-1}$ either resides in a single element of our difference vector or is\ndivided into two consecutive elements of our difference vector. Moreover,\nwithin such a pair it is possible for the sample immediately following a\ndiscontinuity point to be either in the first or second component of the pair.\nBecause of the possible variations inherent in making matches between two\ndifference sequences $d_1$ and $d_2$, it is natural to consider a variation of the\ndynamic programming scheme proposed in [10]. We formulate a longest\npath problem from a starting vertex to a termination vertex in a directed,\nacyclic graph to seek the most desirable sets of clusters within $d_1$ and $d_2$\nsubject to both the types of constraints needed in [10] and the constraints\nof Theorem 4. As in the dynamic programming scheme of [10] we design\nthe graph to contain alignment vertices which are neighbors of the starting\nvertex. However, we now work with segmentation pairs of clusters of either a\nsingle element or two consecutive elements. We assume $v \\geq 1$ so that $d_1[0]$\nand $d_2[0]$ precede the first samples of the support of $\\tilde{g}(t)$. The alignment\nvertices are labeled by ordered pairs\n$(i_1, i_2) \\in \\{(0, 0), (0, 1), \\dots, (0, N - 2), (1, 0), \\dots, (N - 2, 0)\\}$,\nwhere vertex $(i_1, i_2)$ means that we begin examining $d_k, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, in\nposition $i_k$.

In this work we consider how round-off errors and blur\nwhich is Gaussian or a mixture of Gaussians can impact superresolution\nand image registration when the underlying function is one dimensional, spa-\ntially limited, and piecewise constant.

The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes.

Their utilization extends across diverse industries such as aerospace, biomedical engineering, energy storage, and informa- tion technology, which are all poised to benefit significantly from the integration of innovative materials that can surmount existing constraints [7]. Undoubtedly, the evolution of novel materials is crucial for fostering technological breakthroughs, invigorating economic prosperity, and elevating the standard of living.\nGenerally, materials science is a major scientific discipline dedicated to the study of advanced functional materials. The search for advanced materials through inverse design of materials is an important research field within materials science. Inverse design of materials essentially involves creating an optimization space based on the desired performance attributes of materials. This process strives to establish a high-dimensional, nonlinear mapping from material properties to structural configurations, while adhering to physical constraints. The development of inverse design of materials has garnered widespread attention in academic works and can be categorized into four major paradigms:\n\u2022 Experiment-driven paradigm. The experimental-driven paradigm is the original method of material discovery, and these methods have played a crucial role in propelling the field of ma- terials science forward. For example, Madame Curie used experi- ments to discover the new elements radium and polonium, Onnes discovered the superconductivity phenomenon in mercury [8], and the discovery of the high-temperature superconducting material MgB2 [9]. However, this experimental-driven paradigm heavily relies on trial-and-error experimentation, individual expertise, and phenomenological scientific theories. Moreover, these methods are characterized by iterative cycles of experiments and obser- vations to determine the properties and behaviors of materials, which is not only time-consuming and resource-intensive but also leads to extended research cycles and increased costs. In materials research, a heavy dependence on personal experience is also common. Although experienced researchers can guide experimental design with their intuition and prior knowledge, this method is limited in terms of reproducibility and scalability. The quantification and transfer of personal experience often face challenges, hindering the process of knowledge accumulation and dissemination [10]. Additionally, personal biases and misunder- standings may arise due to individual backgrounds and cognitive limitations [2].\n\u2022 Theory-driven paradigm. The theory-driven paradigm em- phasizes the key role of theoretical insights and computational models in materials science. This paradigm is characterized by the widespread use of molecular dynamics simulations and ther- modynamic models to understand and predict material behavior. These developments have, to a certain extent, simplified mate- rial research and enhanced the efficiency of investigations into new materials. There are some very famous materials and states of matter that were first predicted by theory and then verified experimentally, and these discoveries have extremely high sci- entific significance, even winning Nobel Prizes. In 1930, British physicist Paul Dirac derived the existence of \"antimatter\" from his quantum mechanical equations, suggesting that for every particle"}, {"title": "2 THE DISCOVERY OF FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS BASED ON AI METHODS", "content": "AI-accelerated discovery of functional materials has emerged as a dominant trend in materials science. As the demand for novel materials continues to grow, traditional material discovery methods often prove too slow and labor-intensive to keep up with the pace of technological innovation. Consequently, artificial intelligence-especially machine learning (ML) and deep learn- ing (DL)\u2014has demonstrated significant potential in advancing material discovery. AI facilitates the efficient identification of patterns in data, the prediction of material properties, and the optimization of complex material compositions, offering tools for materials science that were previously unimaginable. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of AI applications across several key categories of functional materials, including superconducting materials, magnetic materials, thermoelectric materials, carbon- based nanomaterials, two-dimensional materials, photovoltaic ma- terials, catalytic materials, high-entropy alloys, and porous mate- rials. These materials are crucial to the development of advanced technologies in areas such as energy storage, electronics, and environmental sustainability."}, {"title": "2.1 Superconducting Materials", "content": "Superconducting materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and complete expulsion of magnetic fields below a critical temper- ature (Tc). These materials have wide applications due to their outstanding physical properties, such as in magnetic resonance imaging [37] and nuclear fusion technology [38]. Superconductor-based devices are used in quantum information processors, ad- vanced sensors, and communication systems [39\u201341]. The dis- covery of superconducting materials back to 1911 when mercury exhibited zero resistance at 4.2K [42]. In 1933, the Meissner effect [43] was observed, where superconductors expel magnetic fields entirely. Significant milestones include the 1973 discovery of niobium-germanium alloy [44] with a Te of 23.2K, and the 1986 breakthrough in copper oxide superconductors [45] reaching 35K, followed by yttrium-barium-copper-oxide materials [46] surpassing 77K in 1987. In 2008, iron-based compounds exceeded 55K [47]. In recent years, high-Te superconductors have advanced, with scandium setting a record for elemental superconductors at 36K [48], and pressed nickelate bilayers reaching liquid-nitrogen temperatures [49]. Hydride superconductors, such as H3S, have also been confirmed under high pressure [50].\nThe search for new high-Te superconductors is a significant task in condensed matter physics. With the advancement of AI technologies, there has been substantial exploration in the field of AI-accelerated superconducting material discovery. The work in [51] utilized data extracted from the SuperCon database [52], comprising approximately 16,400 compounds (without crystal structures). They employed a random forest algorithm to build machine learning models aiming at predicting the critical temper- ature of superconducting materials. Separate regression models were developed for different superconducting families, such as cuprates, iron-based superconductors, and low-To superconduc- tors. Through ablation studies, it was demonstrated that these regression models could not be generalized across different super- conducting families, likely due to their distinct superconducting mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of band theory in ex- plaining superconducting mechanisms, recent work [53] employed electronic band structure data and applied a Transformer-based model with attention mechanisms to predict the superconducting To of materials. Teng-dong Zhang et al. released the SuperBand dataset, comprising electronic band structures suitable for machine learning training, generated through high-throughput DFT calcu- lations [54].\nTraditional machine learning algorithms struggle to effec- tively model complex crystal structures, whereas GNNs [55- 60] have a natural advantage in representing such structures."}, {"title": "2.2 Magnetic Materials", "content": "Magnetic materials are substances capable of generating magneti- zation when subjected to a magnetic field, exhibiting the property of attracting ferromagnetic elements such as iron. Dating back approximately 2,500 years, humanity had discovered that certain materials possess the ability to attract iron. For centuries, the creation of artificial magnets was confined to a singular method: friction with a natural magnet or an existing artificial magnet, the latter having been initially produced through contact with a natural source. A pivotal moment arrived in 1820 when Hans Christian Oersted uncovered the magnetic effects induced by electric currents. This discovery paved the way for the invention of the electromagnet in 1825, a breakthrough that introduced a novel means to generate significantly stronger artificial magnetic fields. Consequently, this period marked the commencement of extensive scientific inquiry into the properties and applications of magnetic materials [87].\nBased on magnetic properties, magnetic materials can be cat- egorized three types: ferromagnetic [88], antiferromagnetic [89], and altermagnetic [90-97]. The difference between ferromagnetic materials and antiferromagnetic materials lies in the arrangement of the magnetic moments within a material and the resulting mag- netic behavior. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit a wide range of magnetic domains [98], where the magnetic moments within each domain are aligned in the same direction. However, the magnetic moments in different domains may be oriented differently. Under the influence of an external magnetic field, ferromagnetic materials can be strongly magnetized, and they possess a high coercivity, meaning a strong reverse magnetic field is required to change the direction of magnetization. After the removal of the external magnetic field, ferromagnetic materials maintain a certain level of remanence and exhibit high permeability. The altermagnetic materials, despite exhibiting antiferromagnetic compensated mag- netic order, show macroscopic time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena and spin polarization similar to ferromagnet. This seemingly contradictory behavior has led scientists to reclassify these materials based on spin-symmetry principles, thereby defin- ing altermagnetism as a new magnetic phase. As research on altermagnetic materials deepens, more material candidates have been discovered with these properties, including insulators, semi- conductors, metals, and high-temperature superconductors [91]. Moreover, altermagnetic materials have garnered significant attention due to their novel physical effects, such as giant magne- toresistance (GMR) [99], unconventional superconductivity [100, 101], tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) [99], piezomagnetic effects [102], spin-splitting torque[103-105], time-reversal odd anomalous effects [94, 106\u2013111], quantum anomalous Hall ef- fects [112], higher-order topological states [113], altermagnetic ferroelectricity [114], and strong spin-orbit coupling effects in light element altermagnetic materials [115] . Recent studies [116] have demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of realizing bipolar- ized Weyl semimetals and the quantum crystal valley Hall effect in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.\nWith the development of science and technology, it is very important to find new magnetic materials with a greater operating temperature range and better performance. Recently, a compre- hensive, experiment-based database of magnetic materials based on large language model have been created, named the northeast materials database (NEMAD) [117]. Itani et al. pointed out that there are several ML models that can classify magnetic materials and predict the magnetic properties of these materials, but the lack of a comprehensive database of magnetic materials leads to a lack of generalization of the models, that is, the accuracy of the models is reduced in predicting different classes of new magnetic materi- als. In view of this, they based an application, GPTArticleExtrac- tor [118], to automatically extract data from scientific articles to build a comprehensive database of material properties. Similarly, Ze-Feng Gao et al. proposed an AI search engine [74] to accel- erate the discovery of altermagnetic materials. The engine first undergoes pre-training using crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN) [73] and the Materials Project database [119]"}, {"title": "2.3 Thermoelectric Materials", "content": "Thermoelectric materials represent a class of functional materials capable of directly converting heat into electricity, and vice versa, through the Seebeck effect, which generates an electric current in response to a temperature gradient [120]. These materials hold sig- nificant promise for applications in waste heat recovery and solid- state cooling technologies. Currently, it is estimated that approx- imately two-thirds of global energy consumption is lost as waste heat, and thermoelectric materials provide a potential pathway to reclaim this wasted energy, thereby improving overall energy efficiency [121]. Furthermore, thermoelectric devices, which re- quire neither mechanical components nor harmful working fluids, present an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution for various applications, including space power systems, automotive and industrial waste heat recovery, and thermal management in microelectronics [122].\nThe performance of thermoelectric materials is generally eval- uated by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, defined as $ZT = \\frac{{\\alpha^2 \\sigma T}}{{\\kappa}}$ where $\\alpha$ is the Seebeck coefficient, $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and $\\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity [123]. The term $\\alpha \\sigma^2$, known as the power factor, is a function of both carrier concentration (n) and carrier mobility (\u03bc) [124]. Achieving a high ZT value requires materials that exhibit both high electrical conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient, while maintaining low thermal conductivity. However, optimizing ZT is challenging due to the interdependence of these parameters; for example, increasing electrical conductivity often leads to a concomitant increase in thermal conductivity, which can diminish the desired improvement in ZT [125]. This trade-off remains one of the central challenges in thermoelectric material research.\nRecent advancements in computational methods, particularly through the integration of machine learning and high-throughput screening techniques, have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. By leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms, researchers can now identify promising thermoelectric materials more efficiently and accurately than with traditional trial-and- error approaches or first-principles calculations alone. Studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning models, such as the random forest (RF) model combined with Bayesian opti- mization, to predict new M2X3-type thermoelectric materials with rhombohedral structures from large datasets, successfully iden- tifying candidates with high thermoelectric performance [126]. Similarly, unsupervised learning techniques, including K-means and Gaussian Mixture models, have been applied to cluster half- Heusler compounds, effectively pinpointing materials with favor- able thermoelectric properties [127]. These approaches underscore the utility of machine learning in uncovering complex structure- property relationships relevant to thermoelectric performance.\nFor doped materials, the DopNet neural network architecture has been introduced to capture the effects of dopants accurately, allowing for the prediction of doped materials' thermoelectric properties based on extensive datasets [128]. This model has successfully predicted the impact of various dopants on crucial properties such as the Seebeck coefficient and electrical con- ductivity. In addition, artificial neural networks combined with techniques like combinatorial gradient thermal annealing have optimized the internal strain of bismuth telluride films, resulting in significant improvements to their Seebeck coefficient [129]. Such studies illustrate the importance of doping and strain engineering in enhancing thermoelectric performance and show how machine learning can assist in identifying critical relationships.\nIn the realm of high-throughput computing and screening, frameworks have been established to analyze compounds like diamond-like ABX2, identifying materials with high ZT values and highlighting key conductive mechanisms contributing to ther- moelectric efficiency [130]. Similarly, approaches that combine high-throughput ab initio calculations with deep neural networks have predicted the thermoelectric properties of IV-V-VI layered semiconductors, revealing high-performance candidates such as n-type Pb2Sb2S5, with ZT values surpassing 1.0 [131]. These integrated approaches expedite the discovery of new thermoelec- tric materials by leveraging machine learning and high-throughput screening. Additionally, the ToBaCCo 3.0 \u00b9 code has been em- ployed for large-scale screening of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Molecular dynamics simulations on 10,194 hypothetical MOFs were conducted to investigate the structural characteristics affecting thermal conductivity, revealing that parameters such as density, pore size, porosity, and surface area significantly influence thermal transport properties [132]. Although machine learning models were not utilized in this study, the computational screening provided valuable insights into the structure-performance relation- ships governing MOF thermal conductivity.\nHigh-throughput screening techniques have also been instru- mental in identifying materials with excellent Peltier cooling per- formance among Heusler compounds, showcasing their potential for sustainable cooling applications [133]. The identification of compounds with desirable electronic structures and thermoelectric transport properties demonstrates the utility of high-throughput approaches for applications in efficient cooling technologies.\nFinally, the integration of machine learning with experimental feedback has been proposed as a promising approach for acceler- ating material discovery. By iteratively refining machine learning models with experimental data, methods such as error correc- tion learning (ECL) have successfully predicted high-performance thermoelectric materials with improved power factors, minimizing experimental trials and enhancing predictive accuracy [134]."}, {"title": "2.4 Carbon-based Nanomaterials", "content": "Carbon-based nanomaterials encompass structures composed of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice, in- cluding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene. Due to their distinct physical and chemical properties, these materials have garnered significant attention in materials science since their discovery [135, 136]. CNTs are classified into single-walled car- bon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The former consists of a single layer of rolled graphene, while the latter comprises multiple concentric graphene layers [137]. These two forms exhibit notable differences in mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon-based nanomaterials, is formed by a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice, offering exceptional carrier mobility and mechanical strength [19].\nOwing to their outstanding electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity, carbon-based nanomaterials are widely applied in various advanced technology sectors. For example, CNTs and graphene are used in the electronics industry for manufacturing miniaturized circuits and efficient semiconduc- tor components, potentially surpassing the limitations of Moore's Law [138]. In the mechanical field, carbon-based nanomaterials are ideal for reinforcing composites due to their lightweight and high-strength characteristics, making them integral in high-performance structural materials for aerospace, automotive, and other industries [139]. In the energy sector, the superior con- ductivity and energy storage capabilities of CNTs and graphene show great promise for improving the energy density of batteries and supercapacitors [140]. However, the synthesis and design of carbon-based nanomaterials involve complex multi-variable opti- mization challenges. Traditional experimental approaches struggle"}, {"title": "2.5 Two-dimensional Materials", "content": "Two-dimensional materials are those that consist of only one to a few atomic layers in the direction of thickness, while they have the potential to extend indefinitely in the plane. These materials are characterized by their unique physical and chemical properties, which differ significantly from their bulk counterparts. Different layers of materials can be held together by van der Waals forces. Materials that rely solely on these interlayer van der Waals interactions, without any covalent bonds between the layers, are referred to as van der Waals heterostructures. These heterostructures combine the unique properties of individual 2D layers to create materials with tailored functionalities, making them promising for a wide range of applications in electronics, photonics, and nanotechnology [152].\nDue to the extremely thin thickness, the movement of electrons in 2D materials is highly constrained, leading to the quantum confinement effect. This effect often results in novel physical properties, making 2D materials of great interest in fields such as electronics [153], spintronics [154], valleytronics [155], optoelec- tronics [156], twistronics [157], and slidetronics [158]. Common examples of 2D materials include graphene, which consists of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lat- tice [159]. Another important class of 2D materials is transition metal dichalcogenides, typically composed of one layer of tran- sition metal atoms (such as Mo or W) sandwiched between two layers of chalcogenide atoms (such as S, Se or Te) [160]. For van der Waals heterostructures, interlayer coupling can be performed by regulating the interaction between different two-dimensional material layers [161].By changing the number of layers and the stacking order, the properties of the van der Waals heterostructures can be fine-tuned, and the 2D materials can be turned into topological insulators through specific layering structures [162].\nCurrently, experimental methods for obtaining single or multi- layer 2D materials include exfoliating them from 3D bulk mate- rials or directly growing them on substrates using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Exfoliation techniques involve peeling off individual layers from bulk materials, while CVD allows for the controlled growth of 2D materials on various substrates [163, 164]. However, discovering new 2D materials through experimental methods can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant investment in both materials and research efforts. ML can learn to capture material feature from a large number of crystals, guiding the synthesis of new 2D materials [165, 166].\nTopological insulators are a typical category of 2D materi- als, that behave as insulators in the body, but exhibit electrical conductivity at the surface or edge. This unique property stems from the topological properties of the material, i.e., the electron band structure of the material has a special topological invariant mathematically. In 2D topological insulators, the spin and mo- mentum of electrons are locked together to form edge states. This phenomenon is called the quantum spin Hall effect [167, 168]."}, {"title": "2.6 Photovoltaic Materials", "content": "Photovoltaic conversion is one of the most important energy conversion methods mastered by humanity, enabling us to \"store light\". The search for high-performance photovoltaic materials has long been a crucial pursuit. Not only do they provide support for lighting and display, but they also contribute to reducing dependence on fossil fuels, thereby having a profound impact on addressing global climate change. The essence of \"storing light\" lies in capturing excitons generated by photons. Enhancing pho- tovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) generally involves two main strategies: improving photon-to-exciton conversion efficiency and designing effective junctions to capture excitons. Photovoltaic conversion works in both directions, and these improvements have the potential to inspire new applications in fields such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, photodetectors, and photocatalysis.\nIn the present, monocrystalline silicon is the most mainstream photovoltaic material. It is widely used in ground-based photo- voltaic power generation due to its relatively high power gen- eration efficiency (27.3% [189]) and long service life. However, it suffers from several shortages. In classical studies, the ideal bandgap for single-junction solar cells is around 1.34 eV, which can theoretically achieve a maximum efficiency of 33.7% [190]. However, the bandgap of monocrystalline silicon is around 1.1 eV and cannot be adjusted [191]. The second is indirect bandgap. It requires phonons as a medium for light absorption, leading to lower absorption efficiency and making it difficult to reduce the material thickness [191]. The last is the high sensitivity to impurities. Although the silicon industry is mature, producing high-purity monocrystalline silicon remains costly [192].\nIII-V compounds represent another important class of photo- voltaic materials, offering significant advantages over silicon in certain applications. These compounds possess direct bandgaps that can be precisely tuned through doping, enabling their use across a broad spectrum of optoelectronic devices [193]. For instance, gallium nitride (GaN), with a bandgap of approximately 3.4 eV, is widely utilized in blue and ultraviolet LEDs [194, 195], whereas gallium arsenide (GaAs), with a bandgap of about 1.42 eV, is commonly applied in red LEDs [195]. III-V compounds exhibit superior thermal stability, high defect tolerance, and ex- ceptional efficiency, making them particularly suitable for ap- plications in extreme environments, such as space-based photo- voltaics [196]. Despite these advantages, III-V compounds also pose challenges, including high production costs, the inclusion of toxic elements, and moderate chemical stability, which may limit their widespread adoption [193, 197]. In the exploration of next- generation photovoltaic materials, perovskites and organic solar cells (OSC) stand out as two prominent directions.\nPerovskite materirals. Perovskite materials have been one of the most important subjects of study in materials science due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and complex crystal structures [198, 199]. The term \"perovskite\" refers to materials that share the crystal structure of calcium titanate (CaTiO3), char- acterized by a general chemical formula of ABX3, where A and B are cations, and X is an anion that bonds with both cations [200]. These materials typically adopt a cubic structure, but various distortions can lead to alternative configurations [200]. Such structural flexibility allows for the incorporation of a wide range of elements, making the perovskite family remarkably diverse, with potentially tens of thousands of possible compositions. Moreover, when considering element substitution and doping, the number of potential perovskite variants could exceed millions [201].\nThe surge of interest in perovskites began with early demon- strations of their potential in solar cells, and the power con- version efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has risen dramatically over the past decade, reaching certified values above 25% [202]. This exceptional performance is largely due to the unique properties of perovskites, such as their high light absorption coefficients, direct and tunable bandgaps, high charge- carrier mobilities, and long carrier diffusion lengths. However, the prototypical organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites are highly sensitive to environmental factors, including moisture, oxygen, and temperature, and their performance depends on the presence of toxic lead Pb. As a result, current research is in- creasingly focused on identifying stable, non-toxic alternatives to traditional lead halide perovskites. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for transitioning perovskites from the laboratory to practical optoelectronic applications.\nMachine learning has demonstrated significant potential in ac- celerating the discovery of high-performance perovskite materials, especially in terms of predicting photovoltaic efficiency and iden- tifying stable, synthesizable structures. Various machine learning models have been successfully deployed to predict key properties"}, {"title": "2.7 Catalyst Materials", "content": "Catalyst materials are defined as a type of substance that has the capacity to alter the rate of a chemical reaction. It is important to note that they are not themselves involved in the final product of the reaction; however, they serve to accelerate or decelerate the rate of the reaction by modifying the path of the reaction and reducing the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. A catalyst retains its chemical nature and quality both before and after a reaction, and therefore, it can be reused on numerous occasions.\nThe history of the application of catalysts can be traced back several hundred years. Over time, catalyst technology has devel- oped in a direction that is increasingly efficient, environmentally friendly and sustainable. It has made significant contributions to a number of fields, including the chemical industry, energy, environmental protection, life science and medicine. In recent years, the field of material synthesis has witnessed a period of accelerated development, largely due to the advent of advanced AI technologies. The synthesis of catalyst materials has been no exception to this trend. Given the extensive scope of catalyst mate- rials and the diverse applications of corresponding ML technology, it was deemed prudent to select a representative sample of work for presentation, taking into account the limitations of author's knowledge in this field.\nDescriptors play an important role in improving the accuracy of ML models. While ML techniques can improve the accuracy of predictions, it is often the case that descriptors determine the upper limit of the prediction [229]. Some researchers concentrate their efforts on the process of searching for additives in the electrochemical deposition of copper catalysts for the reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) [230]. The selection of an appropriate combination of additives for the preparation of the catalyst is a challenging process. To solve this problem, a strategy comprising three rounds of learning, integrating experimental outcomes and ML, is devised and subsequently applied to an additive library. The process enabled researchers to identify crucial chemical components and to synthesise the requisite molecules. This work represents a sig- nificant contribution to the field of experiment-based descriptors. Furthermore, the analysis of descriptors for product selectivity in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction has been conducted using ML and physical quantities derived from the periodic table [231]. One of the principal objectives of this study is to investigate the selectivity of C2H4/C2H6 (C2s). The process employs the use of hierarchical clustering, random forest clas- sifier, and support vector classifier. Eventually, three previously unreported catalysts with high C2s are identified as potential can- didates, i.e. Ti-V-Ce-BaO, Y-Y-Eu-TiO2 and La-Pr-Hf-BaO, and their performance is subsequently verified through experimental analysis. The authors additionally examine five additional related descriptors. The authors additionally examine five related descrip- tors and conclude that high C2s values are associated with low first ionization energies, electron affinities and electronegativities, as well as high second ionization energies and densities.\nIn addition to experiment-based descriptors, there has been some work utilizing theory-guided descriptors. The SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) descriptors are expressed as nonlinear functions of intrinsic properties of the clean catalyst surface [232]. The authors demonstrated that their method was more general and accurate in predicting the adsorption energy of alloys on mixed metal surfaces, even when based on training data that included only pure metals. In the event that a considerable number of features are available, the compressive sensing method SISSO represents an appropriate solution [233]. This approach has also been applied to the study of other materials, including perovskite oxides and halides [234] and doped transition metal oxides [235]. However, this method still has some limitations, such as the presence of nearly degenerate models, stability issues when dealing with data perturbations, and unclear physical inter- pretations [236]. There is also a lot of work on theory-guided"}, {"title": "2.8 High-Entropy Alloys", "content": "High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a class of innovative materials made from five or more elements in nearly equal proportions. The traditional idea of making alloys is to add other reinforcing elements to a metal, which has been used extensively throughout human history. In 2004, the discovery of HEAs offers a distinctive alloying strategy [253, 254]. These new materials are referred to as HEAs due to their increased configurational entropy, which was believed to be the key factor in their stabilization. Although it was later found that configurational entropy was not as important as first assumed [255, 256]. HEAs have many excellent mechanical properties and a large component space, which provides a good platform for material research.\nHowever, when faced with the design of HEAs, conventional methods hit a major roadblock. Considering only the usual el- ements of the periodic table, this spans a huge composition space, which cannot be managed by conventional material design approaches, such as the calculation of phase diagrams and density- functional theory [257].\nThe past decades have witnessed the rapid development of machine learning, which suggests that it is likely to make a difference in the area of material design for HEAs [34, 258]. Some researchers utilize several ML models including some simple deep nueral networks and select a conditional random search to be the inverse predictor to design the new HEAs [259]. And they successfully find two HEAs with better ultimate tensile strength and total elongation than the input datasets. Support vector ma- chine is also utilized to tackle problems of HEAs [260]. In their approach, the emphasis is on the framework of hyperparameter tuning and the use of weighted values. Through experiments, they discovere that their architecture performs very well and even exceeds the results of artificial neural network (ANN). There is also some work on comparing the effectiveness of different methods. Researchers test three different ML algorithms, namely K-nearest neighbours, SVM, and two ANNs, i.e. the unsupervised self-organizing maps and the supervised multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLFFNN) [261]. They conclude that MLFFNN performs better. There is also some work that has tested Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boost- ing Classifier, and ANN. They claim ANN exhibits the highest accuracy [262].\nAll of the work described above is an attempt to employ ML techniques, but does not fully incorporate the characteristics of HEAs themselves. The dataset for HEAs is not large enough, so there is a need of the architectures that can be trained from small samples to produce sufficiently adaptive structures. Some recent work considers this issue to some degree.\nThe first work to mention is about active learning. A typical example illustrates the successful implementation of an iterative approach for the synthesis of new HEAs [257]. Their workflow is a closed-loop where ML techniques, DFT, thermodynamic calculations and experiments are used in the process. Their re- search focuses on the design of high-entropy Invar alloys with low thermal expansion coefficients (TEC), and they investigate FeNiCoCr HEAs and FeNiCoCrCu HEAs. From their data, it is known that the HEAs find have lower TEC and higher config- urational entropy compared to past materials. In addition to the ability of discovering new HEAs, one of the greatest strengths of"}, {"title": "2.9 Porous Materials", "content": "Porous materials are a class of materials with a pore structure filled with holes or voids of varying sizes. The size, shape and distribution of the pores determine the properties of the material. Porous materials usually have a high specific surface area, low density and good adsorption capacity, which give them a wide range of applications in a variety of fields, such as the chemical industry, energy, environment and biomedicine. Zeolites are a representative class of porous materials. Newly emerging porous materials, including metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), covalent organic framework materials (COFs), and carbon-based porous materials, have expanded the range of applications of porous materials [267, 268].\nIn recent years, there have been significant developments in the field of AI, with notable advances in the area of porous material synthesis. Given that zeolites were synthesised earlier and are more widely used than other porous materials, it is unsurprising that research has been conducted into the AI-assisted synthesis of zeolites. In their study, the researchers employ a generative adversarial network, designated as ZeoGAN, to generate 121 crystalline porous materials [10]. The neural network receives inputs in the form of energy and material dimensions, and the results demonstrate that zeolites with a desired range of 4 kJ/mol methane heat of adsorption can be produced with reliability. Four years later, work employing diffusion modelling in the context of porous materials is published [269], and the corresponding"}, {"title": "3 THE DEVELOPMENT OF AI METHODS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE", "content": "In this chapter, we present a comprehensive review of the advance- ments in AI technologies within the field of materials science. Drawing upon recent trends and the growing significance of AI, we explore traditional machine learning methods, geometric graph neural networks (GNNs), discriminative AI, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs). As illustrated in Figure 4, GNNS are classified into invariant and equivariant models. Invariant GNNs are extensively applied in discriminative AI for predicting material properties, thereby enabling high-throughput screening. In contrast, equivariant GNNs are predominantly employed in generative AI to facilitate structural predictions of materials. Next, we provide a detailed overview of the development of these algorithms and their applications in materials discovery."}, {"title": "3.1 Traditional Machine Learning Methods", "content": "We categorize techniques such as random forests, convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM), and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) as traditional machine learning methods. These algorithms are among the most commonly applied in materials discovery, with each offering distinct advantages in addressing different design challenges. Random Forest, as an ensemble method, combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to reduce the risk of overfitting from individual trees. Its formula is given by\n$\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i(x),$ (1)\nwhere $\\hat{y}$ represents the final prediction"}]}

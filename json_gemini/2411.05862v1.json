RESULTS", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Overview of MSSDAN", "content": "In this paper, we propose MSSDAN, a new domain adapta-\ntion method for the brain-computer interface, which consists of\nthree main components: (1) Set-up of the proposed multi-scale\nspatial data distribution difference problem, (2) Topological\npermutation and multi-scale spatial feature extractor (MSSFE),\nand (3) Multi-scale spatial domain adaptation (MSSDA). The\nwhole framework in this paper is presented in Fig. 1: our goal\nis to transfer the source subject's spatiotemporal knowledge\n(with a particular emphasis on spatial information) to the target\nsubject to finalize the classification for the target domain. The\nproposed MSSDAN method is presented in the following four eventually leading to the global data distribution difference of\ndifferent aspects.\n1) Problem set-up: To better understand the principles of\nthe proposed MSSDAN model, we first describe the set-up\nof the proposed multi-scale spatial data distribution difference\nproblem. As shown in the blue box of Fig. 1a, because of\nthe multi-scale topological structures and connections of the\nbrain networks, the data distribution varies from electrode\nto electrode under both intra- and inter-subject. The signal\nof the electrode is the basic element of EEG signal, and as\ndetermined by the interaction mechanism of the human brain,\nsuch electrode-scale data distribution difference will thus give\nrise to the global data distribution difference, including region-\nand hemisphere-scale as shown in the green box in Fig. 1a.\nAs mentioned in Section I, the topological connection of\nthe human brain can be described in three different scales,\ninter-subject (the green box in Fig. 1a). In order to reduce\nthe global data distribution difference between subjects, we\nsynthesize and utilize the data distribution differences across\nvarious brain scales, accomplishing domain adaptation across\nmultiple brain scales (Fig. 1c).\nThe global data distribution difference exists under both\nintra- and inter-subject scenarios, including the data distri-\nbution differences in both region and hemisphere scales. To\nsolve the multi-scale spatial data distribution problem in both\nwithin- and cross-subject scenarios, the proposed domain\nadaptation model, MSSDAN (consists of topological permu-\ntation, MSSFE, and MSSDA as shown in Fig. 1b and 1c), is\ndesigned to extract the deep spatial features via a specially\ndesigned multi-scale spatial feature extractor (MSSFE), and\nthe spatial information is transferred via multi-scale spatial"}, {"title": "domain adaptation (MSSDA).", "content": "As shown in the red box in Fig. 1a, the proposed model\nregards two subjects' MI data sets as inputs, completing\nunsupervised MI classification of target domain data using\nsource domain data and labels. The MI sets can be described\nas the source set $X_s = \\{s^{(i,e)}\\}_{(i=1,...,n_1),(e=1,...,k)}$ and the\ntarget set $X_t = \\{t^{(i,e)}\\}_{(j=1,...,n_2),(e=1,...,k)}$ with $n_1$ and $n_2$\ntrials respectively, where each trial consists of the electrode\ndata from k electrodes, recording the brain activity at the\ncorresponding location.\nAdditionally, the topological brain connections are inextri-\ncably linked with the geometry of the brain, and the geo-\ngraphical location of the electrodes and regions are incorpo-\nrated as part of the calculations. The coordinates of all the\nelectrode channels from the source domain can be denoted\nas $chs = \\{C_x^{(e)}, C_y^{(e)}\\}_{e=1,....k}$ that contains k electrodes,\ncontaining the location of the electrode in the experiment.\n2) Multi-scale spatial feature extractor: With the input MI\ndata, we first employ topological permutation to keep the raw\nMI data following an empirical topological permutation (Fig.\n2a: a permutation that mimics the interaction of brain regions),\nfacilitating the feature extractor to obtain via the deep features\nfrom different brain regions.\nIn this paper, we propose three typical topological permu-\ntation rules: horizontal topological permutation rule, vertical\ntopological permutation rule, and global topological permuta-\ntion rule. All the topological rules are designed and computed\nin terms of the spatial properties of the EEG signals, assign-\ning topological information to the raw electrode series. The\npermuted MI data from both two sets are then loaded into\nthe multi-scale feature extractor, obtaining the deep spatial\nfeatures in different brain scales (electrode-scale, region-scale,\nand hemisphere-scale) as shown in Fig. 2b.\nAs shown in Fig. 2b, the specially designed multi-scale\nspatial feature extractor consists of four convolution blocks,\nextracting spatial features from different brain scales. With\nthe empirical topological information assigned by different\ntopological permutation rules, the electrode will be divided\ninto different brain regions, with different brain region atlas\nshown in Fig. 2c.\n3) Multi-scale spatial domain adaptation: With the multi-\nscale spatial features extracted by MSSFE, the spatiotemporal\nknowledge from the source set is then transferred to the target\nset via MSSDA. The MSSDA incorporates three adaptation\nlayers with different spatial scales: electrode adaptation, region\nadaptation, and hemisphere adaptation, integrating multi-scale\nand cross-scale brain connections and interactions under cross-\nsubject and within-subject scenarios."}, {"title": "III.

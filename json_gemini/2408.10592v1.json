These problems require solvers to interpret both textual descriptions and geometry diagrams, necessitating a combined understanding of algebraic and geometric principles. The complexity arises from needing to apply geometric theorems and manage implicit information within diagrams, which are not always explicitly stated. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing intelligent educational tools and advancing automated reasoning systems. Therefore, effective methods for APGD solving are essential for educational applications.\nIn the domain of solving APGDs, existing techniques are divided into two primary categories: the neural methods and the symbolic methods. Neural methods utilize neural networks to process multimodal inputs-integrating textual descriptions and geometry diagrams into a unified sequence for generating solutions. Recent advances in this area include the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4V, which can handle complex language and diagrams, further enhancing the capability of neural models in understanding and solving APGDs. These methods are noted for their ability to capture the multimodal nature of the problems, providing a flexible approach to generating solutions. Meanwhile, symbolic methods focus on extracting and interpreting geometric relations from APGD, constructing symbolic representations that are essential for applying geometric theorems and algebraic operations. Symbolic methods include both traditional symbolic methods, which only rely on predefined rules and symbolic systems, and neuro-symbolic methods , which utilize neural models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of symbolic systems. These methods emphasize the importance of accurately understanding the geometric context provided by diagrams, working in conjunction with textual description to solve APGDs.\nDespite the progress made by existing methods, both neural methods and symbolic methods still have significant limitations. Neural methods often struggle with accurately interpreting mathematical diagrams and exhibit vulnerabilities in mathematical reasoning. This can result in errors when converting geometry diagrams into mathematical expressions. Additionally, the solutions often lack clarity in logical progression, making it difficult to follow the reasoning process. Traditional symbolic methods , while providing mathematical rigor, also have limitations. They are prone to generating redundant steps, resulting in longer solution times and decreased efficiency. To address these limitations, neuro-symbolic methods utilize neural networks to implement decision-making, integrating this with symbolic manipulation to enable step-by-step deduction. However, most of the existing neuro-symbolic methods are running on the same symbolic system as InterGPS, which necessitates rewriting code to add new theorems. This process can be inefficient and prone to errors, such as introducing bugs and creating inconsistencies, all of which can hinder the scalability and robustness of the system. Moreover, the existing methods typically only output the theorem names without specifying their application to particular geometric elements or the associated equations, which limits its utility in educational scenarios where detailed, interpretable outputs are crucial for effective teaching and learning.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel method called HGR, a hologram-based reasoning method for solving APGDs. HGR parses the problem text and diagrams, converting them into a unified global hologram where vertices represent geometric primitives (points, lines, angles, etc.) and edges depict their relations. We maintain a model pool that contains multiple predefined graph models, each graph model uniquely characterized by a specific pattern hologram, effectively representing a theorem and corresponding reasoning rules. Deep reinforcement learning is employed to select the graph model from the pool. Once a graph model is selected and matched with the global hologram, it specifies which geometric theorems to apply to which primitives. The operations defined by the model are then applied to generate the corresponding algebraic equations and modify the global hologram by adding new vertices and edges or updating attributes. The process is repeated until a solution is reached, thereby providing a structured and efficient solution while enhancing interpretability. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. We propose a hologram-based reasoning method that addresses APGD solving by unifying the information from problem text and diagrams into a hologram and performs reasoning directly on the hologram.\n2. We propose a method for effectively matching graph models within a hologram, supported by a specifically developed pool of models, to efficiently extract relevant geometric relations and algebraic equations.\n3. we propose a deep reinforcement learning method that optimizes the selection of graph models from the pool to enhance the efficiency of the model matching process."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Recent advancements in solving APGDs have primarily focused on two categories: neural methods and symbolic methods. Neural methods leverage neural networks to integrate textual and diagrammatic inputs, producing solutions through cross-modal representations. Neural methods excel at processing multimodal data, creating a unified framework for processing text and diagrams. However, they often struggle with accurately capturing the detailed aspects of diagrams and maintaining logical coherence in the solutions. There is a growing trend in leveraging LLMs for solving APGDs, utilizing their extensive pre-trained knowledge to interpret and generate mathematical reasoning. However, these LLMs often struggle to accurately extract necessary information from geometry diagrams, leading to significant performance drops. Their reliance on the quality and scope of training datasets also limits their generalization across different datasets and problem types, resulting in inconsistent performance and susceptibility to errors in mathematical reasoning . Unlike neural methods, symbolic methods first parse the textual descriptions and geometric diagrams to extract structured representations, then utilize these representations to apply predefined theorems and rules for problem-solving. These methods demonstrate expertise in providing a clear rule-based framework for interpreting the geometric relations within APGDs, making them highly interpretable and ensuring mathematical rigor. However, symbolic methods are often constrained by their reliance on rigid symbolic systems based on formal language, limiting their applicability. To address these issues, our method utilizes a hologram-based reasoning system. It allows for more flexible and adaptable representations, improving the efficiency and accuracy of APGD-solving."}, {"title": "Integration of Neural and Symbolic Methods", "content": "To address the limitations of neural and traditional symbolic methods, the integration of symbolic and neural methods has led to significant advancements in solving APGDs.

In this section, the definition of the hologram and each HGR component are introduced separately."}, {"title": "Hologram", "content": "Inspired by the Geometry Logic Graph (GLG) used in GeoDRL , we optimize it to better suit the specific requirements of APGDs and propose the hologram which serves as the foundation for reasoning process and solution generation.\nThe hologram is a heterogeneous attributed graph denoted as G = (V, E, A, \u00c2), where:\n\u2022 Vertices V: The vertices in the hologram represent various geometric primitives, including points, lines, angles, arcs, circles and polygons.\n\u2022 Edges E: The edges represent the geometric relations between the primitives, including adjacency, incidence (e.g., a point on a line), parallelism, perpendicularity, similarity and congruence. These edges ensure the hologram accurately reflects the spatial and relational data from the problem. The edges do not have a direction since the hologram is an undirected graph, reflecting the symmetrical nature of geometric relations.\n\u2022 Mathematical Attributes A: Mathematical attributes associated with vertices include measurable properties such as lengths of lines, measures of angles, and area of polygons. Additionally, the hologram incorporates a special target attribute \\( \\tau \\) that specifies the problem's target. These attributes are critical for incorporating quantitative data necessary for problem-solving.\n\u2022 Visual Attributes \u00c2: Visual attributes associated with vertices are the properties of geometric primitives calculated from the diagram image, such as point positions, visual lengths and angles. Visual attributes are not used in the formal calculation process but serve as auxiliary data to support model matching process.\nUsing the hologram for reasoning in HGR provides several advantages. It provides a structured representation of the problem, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional symbolic reasoning methods, such as handling spatial and geometric relations inadequately. This structured approach enhances efficiency and precision, allowing for the rapid identification and application of relevant theorems and rules. Additionally, by avoiding the redundancy of symbolic grammar, it ensures that the reasoning process is clear and precise, facilitating better problem-solving in APGDs."}, {"title": "Parser", "content": "The parser of HGR plays a critical role in converting raw problem inputs into structured data that can be used for reasoning. The parser consists of three parts: text parser, diagram parser, and hologram generator.\nText Parser. The text parser adopts the rule-based approach used in Inter-GPS and GeoDRL . The text parser interprets the problem text T into a set of logical expressions in formal language (e.g., Triangle(A, B, C) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C))). The parsing process involves identifying and extracting key elements from T, including geometric primitives (e.g., points, lines, and angles), values, geometric relations and the problem's target. T is converted into a set of logical expressions, denoted as \\( \\Sigma_{T} \\).\nDiagram Parser. The diagram parser adopts an end-to-end model called PGDPNet  to analyze and interpret the geometry diagram D provided in the problem. PGDPNet takes the diagram image as input and efficiently identifies and extracts geometric primitives from D. It also recognizes text annotations (e.g., lengths and angle measures) and geometric symbols (e.g., parallel and perpendicular indicators) within D. These elements are then integrated into a set of logical expressions, denoted as \\( \\Sigma_{D} \\).\nHologram Generator. The hologram generator is responsible for converting the parsed structured data \\( \\Sigma = \\Sigma_{T} \\cup \\Sigma_{D} \\) into a hologram. Based on the hologram definition, the global hologram \\( G_{g} = (V_{g}, E_{g}, A, \\hat{A}) \\) is generated, encompassing all geometric primitives and relations derived from the problem's given information. shows an example of an APGD and the global hologram."}, {"title": "Graph Model Construction", "content": "In HGR, graph models play a crucial role in the reasoning process, as they encapsulate geometric configurations and relations, enabling systematic application of theorems and rules to derive algebraic equations essential for solutions. These models are divided into two primary types: Proving Models \\( M_{prov} \\) and Property Models \\( M_{prop} \\). Both types of models share common components but serve different purposes within the reasoning process. The collection of these models forms the model pool, denoted as \\( M = M_{prov} \\cup M_{prop} \\).\nProving model \\( m_{prov} = (G_{p}, R, \\hat{C}, C, \\Delta G) \\in M_{prov} \\) and property model \\( m_{prop} = (G_{p}, R, \\hat{C}, E) \\in M_{prop} \\) have the following common components: 1) Pattern Hologram \\( G_{p} = (V_{p}, E_{p}) \\) is generated based on the hologram definition without including attribute values for the vertices. It is used in both \\( m_{prov} \\) and \\( M_{prop} \\) to match with \\( G_{g} \\). It identifies specific geometric configurations corresponding to known theorems or properties. 2) Relation R represents the geometric relation template associated with each graph model. While they do not actively participate in the reasoning process, they play a crucial role in the solution-generation process by providing a readable explanation of the solution. 3) Visual Constraints \\( \\hat{C} \\) are crucial for ensuring the accuracy of pattern matching in the hologram, as the matching process itself primarily ensures topological consistency. \\( \\hat{C} \\) provides auxiliary information necessary for resolving ambiguities that arise from purely topological matches. For instance, when two triangles are known to be similar but the corresponding angles are not explicitly identified, \\( \\hat{C} \\) helps determine the correct angle correspondences by comparing visual aspects like the proximity of angle measures. This ensures that the correct geometric relations are established, thus enhancing the precision of the reasoning process.\nProving model \\( m_{prov} \\) contains the following specific components: 1) Mathematical Constraints C are used to verify whether the mathematical attributes of geometric primitives in \\( G_{g} \\), such as angle measures or line segment lengths, meet the conditions required for the theorem being established. 2) Graph Expansion \\( \\Delta G \\) refers to a set of operations applied to \\( G_{g} \\), which involves adding new vertices and edges and modifying mathematical attributes. It facilitates the application of geometric theorems and extends the reasoning process by introducing new geometric primitives or modifying existing ones.\nProperty model \\( m_{prop} \\) contains the specific component Equations E, which describes the quantitative properties of geometric primitives. The generated equations are then added to the equation set for solving.\n illustrates how the proving and property models are used in HGR. The proving model \\( m_{prov} \\) demonstrates the process of proving that two lines are parallel by verifying that the sum of co-interior angles equals 180 degrees. It then updates \\( G_{g} \\) by adding a Parallel edge. This updated hologram allows the property model \\( m_{prop} \\) to match and establish geometric relations, such as identifying that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. The detailed matching and reasoning processes are elaborated in Reasoner."}, {"title": "Reasoner", "content": "The reasoner in HGR iteratively applies geometric theorems to the global hologram \\( G_{g} \\) until the final solution is reached. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the reasoning process involves several key steps: 1) Proving model matching, where the proving model is matched with \\( G_{g} \\); 2) Graph expansion, updating \\( G_{g} \\) with new vertices or edges based on the matching; 3) Property model matching, where the property model is matched with \\( G_{g} \\); 4) Equations derivation, where equations are derived based on the matched property models; and 5) Attributes update, updating the mathematical attributes of the vertices of \\( G_{g} \\) based on the solutions obtained from the equations. The iterative process continues until the target answer is obtained, ensuring all relevant theorems are applied accurately.\nModel Matching (Step 1 and 3). The model matching process of the reasoner determines which theorems to apply to specific geometric primitives identified in \\( G_{g} \\). The model matching process consists of graph pattern matching, mathematical constraints verification (for proving models) and visual constraints verification.\nGraph pattern matching involves finding a mapping function between the pattern hologram \\( G_{p} = (V_{p}, E_{p}) \\) and global hologram \\( G_{g} = (V_{g}, E_{g}, A, \\hat{A}) \\):\n\\[ M: V_{p} \\rightarrow V_{g} \\] (1)\nwhere \\( V_{p} \\) and \\( V_{9} \\) represent the sets of vertices in \\( G_{p} \\) and \\( G_{g} \\) respectively. The function M must preserve the graph's structure by maintaining the presence and absence of edges between corresponding vertice pairs.\nFor this task, we utilize the VF3 algorithm , which has been shown to offer high efficiency and accuracy in graph pattern matching.\nFollowing the graph pattern matching, the mathematical constraints verification ensures that the mathematical attributes A of the mapped vertices meet the specific conditions required for the theorems to be applied. Each mathematical constraint \\( c_{i} \\in C \\) is evaluated as follows:\n\\[ C(M(V_{p})) = \\begin{cases} True & f_{i}(A(M(V_{p}))) = 0 \\\\ False & otherwise \\end{cases} \\] (2)\nwhere \\( M(V_{p}) \\) denotes retrieving the mapped vertices from \\( V_{g} \\) based on the mapping function M, A(\u00b7) denotes obtaining the mathematical attributes of vertices from A, and \\( f_{i}(\u00b7) \\) denotes evaluating the i-th algebraic function of C.\nThe overall mathematical constraints verification C is determined by the logical conjunction of all constraints \\( c_{i} \\):\n\\[ C(M(V_{p})) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} c_{i}(M(V_{p})) \\] (3)\nIf any constraint \\( c_{i} \\) fails, C outputs False, indicating that the theorem cannot be applied to the current state. The visual constraints verification follows a similar process, with \\( c_{i} \\in C \\) and A replaced by \\( \\hat{c}_{i} \\in \\hat{C} \\) and \u00c2 respectively. When graph pattern matching, mathematical constraints verification (for proving models), and visual constraints verification all succeed, the graph model is considered successfully matched. The geometric relation template is instantiated using M for solution presentation, denoted as R\\((M(V_{p}))\\).\nOperations Application (Step 2 and 4). Once the model matching process is successful, specific operations are executed depending on the type of graph model.\nFor the proving model, graph expansion is performed based on the mapping M established during the model matching, resulting in a new global hologram \\( G_{g} \\):\n\\[ G_{g} \\leftarrow G_{g} + \\Delta G(M(V_{p})) \\] (4)\nwhere \\( \\Delta G(M(V_{p})) \\) denotes the set of graph expansion operations applied to \\( G_{g} \\).\nFor the property model, variables of equations \\( \\mathcal{E} \\) are replaced with the actual mathematical attributes of \\( V_{g} \\) from A:\n\\[ \\mathcal{E} = \\{e_{i} \\in E | e_{i} = g_{i}(A(M(V_{p}))) \\} \\] (5)\nwhere \\( g_{i}(\u00b7) \\) denotes replace variables of the i-th equation in E. The generated set of equations \\( \\mathcal{E} \\) is then added into the equation set \\( \\mathcal{E}_{total} = \\mathcal{E}_{total} \\cup \\mathcal{E} \\) for the equations solving process.\nEquations Solving and Attributes Update (Step 5). The set of equations \\( \\mathcal{E}_{total} \\) is solved to find the unknown values. The solution is then used to update the mathematical attributes in \\( G_{g} \\). If the updated mathematical attributes satisfy the problem target \\( \\tau \\), the reasoning process concludes. Otherwise, the reasoning process continues iteratively.\nEnhanced Model Selection. In HGR, a critical challenge is efficiently selecting the appropriate graph models to match. A naive method would involve employing a heuristic strategy to exhaustively search through all graph models, but this method becomes inefficient as the complexity and number of graph models increase.\nTo address this, we design a model selection agent that implements deep reinforcement learning to select the graph model at each reasoning step. The objective is to find a deterministic policy \\( \\pi : s \\rightarrow \\pi(s) = a \\) that maximize the expected cumulative rewards:\n\\[ \\pi^{*} = arg \\underset{\\pi}{max} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{E}[r(s_{t}, a_{t})] \\] (6)\nwhere \\( r(s_{t}, a_{t}) \\) is the reward of obtained at step t for taking action at in state st, and \\( \\pi^{*} \\) is the optimal policy.\nIn the implementation, the state s is represented by the global hologram \\( G_{g} \\) and the action a is represented by selecting the graph model \\( m \\in M \\). The GraphTransformer  is utilized to encode the state s, capturing its structural and attribute information, and to assess the effectiveness of potential actions.\nThe reward function r(s, a) for selecting a model m based on the global hologram \\( G_{g} \\) is defined as follows:\n\\[ r(s, a) = \\begin{cases} 1.0 - a e^{-\\theta} & \\text{if } s' \\models \\tau \\\\ -a e^{-\\theta} & \\text{if } s' \\neq s \\text{ and } s' \\not\\models \\tau \\\\ -1.0 & \\text{if } s' = s \\end{cases} \\] (7)\nwhere s' is the updated global hologram after taking action a, \\( \\theta \\) is the time spent, \\( a e^{-\\theta} \\) is a time penalty factor. The agent gets the positive reward if s' satisfies the target \\( \\tau \\).\nThe optimization process is carried out using the DQN algorithm , which guides the agent in efficiently navigating through the model pool and selecting the most promising graph model for matching at each step. Algorithm 1 details the iterative reasoning process for solving the APGD using either a heuristic strategy or a model selection agent."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Datasets. The experiments are primarily conducted on Geometry3K , a comprehensive dataset designed for evaluating geometry problem-solving systems. Geometry3K consists of 3,002 SAT-style APGDs. Each problem in the dataset is presented as a single-choice question with four choices, accompanied by problem text, a geometric diagram, and explicit parsing annotations in a formal language. The problems cover a wide range of geometric shapes, including lines, triangles, circles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating the performance of problem solvers.\nEvaluation Metrics. To evaluate the performance in solving APGDs, two primary metrics are used: 1) accuracy: the accuracy is determined by whether the numerical result produced is closest to the correct answer among four choices. In cases where the method fails to produce a numerical result, a random selection is made; 2) reasoning steps: the average number of geometric theorems applied to generate the solution. For HGR, theorems are counted by the number of successful graph model matches. Additionally, the count includes the number of geometric relations and equations generated, represented as a combined metric: theorems / relations / equations.\nBaselines\nHGR is compared against several baseline methods recognized for their effectiveness in solving APGDs. FiLM is used for visual reasoning on abstract images, adapted for APGD solving. Enhanced versions, FiLM-BERT and FiLM-BART , incorporate BERT and BART encoders to improve performance.

To enable efficient graph pattern matching using the VF3 algorithm, both the global hologram and pattern holograms are converted into GRF format. For training the model selection agent, both the heuristic strategy and random selection are employed to generate model selection samples for the training set, with the heuristic strategy focused on generating more samples with positive rewards, while the random selection tends to generate more samples with negative rewards. The agent is then pre-trained on these samples for 5000 steps to establish an initial policy. Finally, the agent is trained using DQN on the training set to refine its policy and improve its performance."}, {"title": "Evaluation", "content": "The evaluation of HGR's accuracy on the Geometry3K dataset, as detailed in Table 1, demonstrates its superior capabilities in solving APGDs compared to baseline methods.

This performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art GeoDRL model and surpasses Inter-GPS, particularly in solving problems related to area calculations or circle type.\nIn terms of efficiency, HGR outperforms the baselines by requiring fewer reasoning steps on average.

As presented in Table 3, the results demonstrate the significance of each component. The removal of the model selection agent results in a notable decrease in overall accuracy from 89.6% to 83.4%, while also increasing the average reasoning steps significantly. This highlights the agent's crucial role in efficiently selecting the appropriate graph models. The removal of proving models reduces accuracy to 79.5%, highlighting their crucial role in modifying the global hologram to enable successful matching of property models. The removal of property models drastically reduces accuracy to 27.0%, highlighting their critical role in generating the necessary algebraic equations for solving problems. Additionally, the exclusion of mathematical constraints and visual constraints lead to declines in accuracy to 73.6% and 63.1%, respectively. These results demonstrate that both constraints are critical for ensuring the correctness and validity of the model matching process."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Interpretability of HGR. Table 4 compares the interpretability of various APGD solvers, showing that HGR offers the most comprehensive interpretability. UniGeo , as a neural method, is only capable of generating the final computational sequence, lacking detailed intermediate explanations. Inter-GPS and GeoDRL , while utilizing the same symbolic system, can output the sequence of theorems used and the geometric primitives to which these theorems were applied. However, their generated equations only include the numerical values of geometric primitives, making it difficult to interpret the underlying geometric relations. Besides, they are unable to generate human-readable solutions directly. In contrast, HGR not only demonstrates the specific geometric theorems applied to corresponding geometric primitives at each step, but also generates equations that demonstrate the algebraic relations between primitives. Additionally, through the use of graph model relation templates, HGR provides human-readable solutions, making it highly suitable for educational applications.\nFailure Case. HGR currently lacks the ability to solve two types of problems, which contributes to a reduction in overall accuracy. The first type involves problems that require auxiliary constructions, such as adding auxiliary points, lines, or circles. The second type of failure case is related to problems that involve calculating the area of shaded regions.

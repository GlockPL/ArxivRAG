{"title": "Research on Travel Route Planing Problem Based on Greedy Algorithm", "authors": ["Yiquan Wang"], "abstract": "The greedy algorithm based route planning problem is a method of finding the optimal or near optimal route between a given starting and ending point. This article first uses PCA method to reduce the dimensionality of urban evaluation indicators, extracts key principal components, and KMO and TOPSIS algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Secondly, for datasets that have not passed the KMO test, a comprehensive evaluation will be conducted using the entropy weight method and TOPSIS method. Finally, based on the greedy algorithm, a route planning algorithm was proposed and optimized to provide personalized route customization according to the different needs of tourists. We also took into account the local travel efficiency, the time required to visit tourist attractions, and necessary daily rest time to reduce costs and avoid falling into the local optimal solution.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid development of China's tourism industry and the continuous strengthening of international exchanges, more and more foreign tourists choose to come to China to experi-ence the rich natural scenery and profound cultural heritage. According to the data of the China Migration Administration, the number of foreigners entering China at all ports increased significantly in 2024, especially the number of tourists coming to China reached 4.361 million. In order to better serve these foreign tourists, China has launched a 144-hour transit visa-free policy and implemented it in multiple cities and ports. This policy not only provides more convenience for foreign tourists to travel to China, but also promotes exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and foreign personnel.\nIn order to enhance the travel experience of foreign tourists, we conducted a study on the attraction routing problem based on a greedy algorithm. This project aims to provide scientific and reasonable tourism route planning for foreign tourists through mathematical modeling and algorithm optimization, ensuring that they can visit as many high-quality attractions as possible within a limited time, while optimizing travel costs and time arrangements."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Nowadays, people are paying more and more attention to personal experience and self-needs during the tourism process [5]. Therefore, the use of mathematical modeling methods to automatically generate travel route plans that meet the needs of tourists and help them enjoy a better travel experience is increasingly receiving attention from both academia and industry.\nTourism route planning is one of the popular research issues in the field of smart tourism. The current research work combines the work in operations research with the travel route planning problem in social media, and plans to study it as a variant based on directed off-road or traveling salesman problems [1, 2, 4, 9].\nIn 2016, Feiran et al. proposed a flexible multi-task deep travel route planning framework called MDTRP, which in-tegrates rich auxiliary information to achieve more effective planning [7]. Xinyi et al. proposed an interactive visual analysis method and introduced automatic route optimization algorithms and various interactions to help users optimize and adjust their itineraries for better tourism route planning [18].\nAna et al. evaluated the theoretical basis of multidimen-sional concepts of tourist spatiotemporal behavior in 2017 and proposed a conceptual model based on behavioral perspectives and intercity destination backgrounds as a comprehensive ana-lytical framework [3]. Yuan et al. developed complex statistical models using high-resolution and fine-grained spatiotemporal data in 2019, and established multinomial logit (MNL) models to identify factors that affect tourist destination choices [8]. Nithyasri et al. proposed a tourism itinerary generator in 2024. By utilizing user-provided details such as destination, budget, and interests, the system can create personalized travel plans [11]."}, {"title": "III. METHODS", "content": "In order to simplify the analysis process and focus on the core elements, we used principal component analysis (PCA) technology to effectively reduce the dimensionality of urban evaluation indicators and extract several key principal components. For some datasets that did not pass the KMO test, we innovatively combined the entropy weight method and TOPSIS method to achieve comprehensive evaluation and weight allocation of the data. When constructing the route optimization model, we applied a greedy algorithm strategy to ensure the optimization and efficiency of the overall tourism planning scheme.\nOur data comes from the Fifth \"Huashu Cup\" National University Student Mathematical Modeling Competition in 2024 [12]. It contains 352 cities with 100 attractions in each city, and the information of each attraction contains the name of the attraction, address, description of the attraction, opening hours, and so on.\nWe adopt a comprehensive evaluation system to simplify the process, and classify the city according to multiple dimen-sions, such as its size, environmental status, cultural heritage, transportation conditions, as well as local climate and culinary characteristics. Specifically, for the indicators that meet the KMO test criteria, we apply principal component analysis to realize their dimensionality reduction; for the indicators that fail to meet this criterion, we introduce the entropy-based TOPSIS method to complete the simplification to one dimension.\nIn response to the data collected, where direct modeling resulted in a large number of indicators, this study chose to simplify the dataset by means of dimensionality reduction, which in turn led to the construction of an assessment model for analysis. The KMO test was used as a measure of the ef-fectiveness of the different dimensionality reduction methods, which is mainly used to determine whether the correlation between the variables is sufficient to perform factor analysis. The KMO value ranges from 0 to 1. Generally speaking, when the KMO value exceeds 0.6, the dataset is considered to be suitable for factor analysis. The KMO algorithm can be found in Pseudocode 1."}, {"title": "IV. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The findings of this study not only offer scientific and ra-tional tourism planning solutions for international visitors but also illustrate the significant potential of greedy algorithms in the domain of path optimisation. In the future, the model will be further optimised by introducing the Octopus Algorithm [16] or drawing on relevant cases of machine learning[10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. This will enable the model to meet the personalised needs of different tourists, to keep up with the changing trends of the tourism market, and to contribute to the sustainable and high-quality development of the tourism industry. At the same time, the research result will be promoted to a wider range of tourism demand areas, thereby improving the tourism experience for a greater number of tourists."}]}

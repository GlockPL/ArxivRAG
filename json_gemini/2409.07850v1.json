Most of these systems provide recommendations exclusively for items within a specific or single domain. Yet, traditional methods encounter challenges in target markets where data is scarce or unavailable, along with substantial variations in user behaviors. To address these challenges, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) and Cross-Market Recommendation (CMR) have emerged as promising approaches [3]. Although both approaches aim to enhance recommendation performance by utilizing information from different domains or markets, they address distinct challenges and find applications in different scenarios.\nCDR is to make recommendations across domains or markets. It is concerned with providing suggestions in a target domain based on knowledge obtained from a source domain [14]. For example, knowledge about a user's book purchases can also be used to offer suggestions on some other seemingly irrelevant topics, like film or music. This approach improves the user experience because there may be dependencies and correlations between user preferences in different domains. Consider a multinational e-commerce company operating across many countries in Europe and is looking to expand into a new market, like Spain, where there is limited local data available. The entity can improve the quality of its recommendation algorithms in Spain by using strong data from mature markets. This approach not only customizes the shopping experience for the Spanish audience but also opens up the door for the company's growth in the region.\nCMR is the choice, for this research paper for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it allows businesses to explore markets and seize opportunities by using data from established markets [3]. This means that when faced with data in a new market personalized recommendations can still be offered to users enhancing their experience and boosting engagement. Secondly, CMR tackles the challenge of data in target markets by utilizing data from source markets that have diverse interactions. This significantly improves the performance of recommendations in the target market [34]. Lastly, it facilitates the discovery of user preferences and behaviors that may vary across markets [15]. By using insights from source markets, the system can adapt to users' distinct characteristics and preferences, in the target market.\nTraditional recommendation methods, such as collaborative filtering [11] and content-based filtering [19], have been widely used for making recommendations in one market. However, these methods often rely on user-item interactions or item attributes within a specific market, making them less effective in understanding the complexities of CMRs. The limitations of traditional methods in the context of CMR can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the lack of data compatibility and heterogeneity across markets presents challenges in using user-item interactions or item attributes from one market to another. Additionally, the differences in user preferences, market dynamics, and product characteristics across markets further complicate the recommendation task [2].\nThese conventional approaches depend on user-item interactions or item attributes within a market, which restricts their usefulness in market activities. Therefore, to provide recommendations that apply across markets, it is necessary to employ advanced strategies capable of navigating the intricacies of the global market [3]. Researchers have turned to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture relationships and dependencies in graph data to tackle these challenges [7]. GNNs have gained popularity in recommender systems and have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in creating user-item representations. Unlike traditional methods, GNNs can incorporate neighborhood information and relational dependencies among items and users, providing a more comprehensive and contextually enriched representation [16].\nUsing GNNs in CMR systems can offer more personalized and on-demand suggestions [21]. Compared to traditional methods, GNNs offer great performance in CMRs due to their ability to manage sparse data and also social information. GNN-based models utilize high-order connectivity, which refers to the capability of these models to capture relationships beyond immediate neighbors in a graph structure [30]. Traditional GNNs typically consider only first-order connections, i.e., direct neighbors of a node [9]. However, high-order connectivity extends this concept to include connections up to k-th order, where k is a parameter that determines the depth of exploration in the graph. By incorporating high-order connectivity, GNNs can effectively capture more complex patterns and dependencies in data. This allows GNN-based models to leverage not only direct interactions but also indirect relationships between nodes, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying graph structure. In the context of collaborative filtering and recommendation systems, high-order connectivity enables GNNs to extract valuable information from distant nodes in the graph, leading to more accurate and personalized suggestions for users [27]. Furthermore, high-order connectivity enhances the ability of GNNs to handle sparse data by using information from nodes that are not directly connected but are reachable through intermediate nodes. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where data sparsity is a common challenge, as it enables GNNs to exploit the full potential of the available information in the graph [32]."}, {"title": "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Cross-market recommendation has made significant progress in recent years, with researchers exploring traditional methods as well as GNNs to tackle the challenges posed by data sparsity and cold-start issues in target markets [17].\nBy combining deep graph recommendation models like GNNS and conventional models like ItemCF [22] and UserCF [33], CMR leverages colloborative signals and similarities across marketplaces. The efficacy of such an approach, employing a combination of models including DeepWalk [20] and LightGBM [13], has been notably shown on the XMRec dataset [4].\nCreating generalized representations for CMR has centered on integrating self-supervised graph learning. SGLCMR, models market-specific aspects by creating single-market graphs and market-generalized features by creating cross-market graphs [35]. Extensive studies on real-world datasets have demonstrated the superiority of this methodology over state-of-the-art CMR methods, since of its utilization of Light Graph Convolution (LGC) [8] and self-supervised graph learning.\nWith models like Bert4CMR, the attention mechanism has also been investigated in CMR with the goal of enhancing recommendation performance across markets [12]. This model uses market embedding to simulate each market's bias and minimize mutual interference between parallel markets, demonstrating cutting-edge outcomes from comprehensive testing.\nGraph Attention Networks (GATs) [24] was a significant breakthrough that addressed the shortcomings of previous graph convolution approaches and allowed for more complex interactions between nodes in a variety of applications, including protein-protein interaction datasets and citation networks. This breakthrough was extended by the HGNNDR model [18], which improved node feature representation in situations with sparse network connections by using multi-order topology information. This improved the quality of recommendations. Similarly, to address the issues of data sparsity and cold-start in item recommendation, the TransD-KGAT method [28] used knowledge graphs, highlighting the effect of GNN-based approaches in recommendation tasks.\nModels such as GraphRec [5] and SR-GNN [26] became specialized frameworks concentrating on social and session-based recommendations. These models demonstrate the adaptability of GNNs in capturing complicated relationships between users and items in a variety of recommendation scenarios, offering complete representations of user-item relationships and enhancing recommendation accuracy. They also complement the enhanced collaborative filtering recommendation model [6].\nWith the introduction of FOREC, the field also witnessed notable advancements in cross-market product recommendation, where it demonstrated its supremacy on the XMarket dataset by utilizing data from both source and target markets [3]. In addition, the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) is introduced, which extends GNNs to heterogeneous graphs and shows that it can manage diverse data difficulties and achive better performance on real-world heterogeneous grahps [25].\nRecent advancements in CMR systems have showcased the versatility and efficacy of GNNs. One notable example includes a recommendation algorithm based on graph factorization machines"}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "To address CMR challenges, we propose \"CrossGR,\" a new method utilizing GIN for their ability to analyze complex user-item graphs, enhancing CMR effectiveness. GINs, introduced by Xu et al. (2018) [29], matches the Weisfeiler-Lehman test in graph analysis prowess, offering a nuanced understanding of graph topology, which marks a significant advancement over prior graph neural network models. This approach allows \"CrossGR\" to more effectively harness the inherent topological features of graphs for improved recommendation accuracy.\nThe motivation behind GIN for our CMR task arises from its unique aggregation function that updates node representations by summing the features of neighboring nodes, including the node itself. This approach ensures that the network can distinguish between different graph structures, a property known as injectivity, which is critical when dealing with diverse and sparse data inherent in cross-market scenarios. The steps applied in our methodology, from data representation to model optimization, are visually summarized in Figure 1, which complements the detailed explanations provided in the following subsections."}, {"title": "3.1 Data Representation", "content": "3.1.1 Notation. In the construction of our graph-based data representation for the CMR system, we encapsulate the user-item interactions within graph G, composed of a set of nodes V and a set of edges E. The nodes in V represent both users and items in the dataset, drafted as sets U and I respectively, reflecting the dual nature of our marketplaces. Interactions between users and items, such as ratings or purchases, form the edges in E, bridging the two distinct sets within our graph. To quantify the interactions encapsulated by E, we introduce an adjacency matrix A, where the weight of each edge Aij signifies the strength and nature of the interaction between user i and item j. This setup inherently forms a bipartite graph, capturing the distinct user-item relationships within our system.\nTo ensure that our model can learn from these interactions without bias toward nodes with higher degrees of connectivity, we normalize the adjacency matrix using the diagonal degree matrix D, where each diagonal element Dii corresponds to the sum of weights connected to node i. The normalization process, yielding A = D\u00af\u00b9A, ensures that the influence of each node is adjusted by its connectivity, facilitating a balanced and effective learning process."}, {"title": "3.2 Graph Isomorphism Network Architecture", "content": "Our CrossGr model employs embeddings for initially representing users and items, mapping their features into a latent space. This foundational step is crucial for capturing the essence of user-item interactions. Subsequently, through the application of GINConv layers, we refine these embeddings by aggregating and transforming features from their neighborhoods. This process enhances the model's ability to accurately reflect the complex dynamics of interactions.\nThe GIN leverages a message-passing framework that iteratively updates node representations by aggregating features from their neighborhoods, thus encapsulating local and global market structures. The model's forward pass involves a series of convolutional operations, each comprising two key components: feature transformation and neighborhood aggregation. Specifically, the GINConv layer employs an \"add\" aggregation function \u2013 a choice motivated by its effectiveness in preventing the over-smoothing of node features, a common challenge in deep GNNs where node representations can become indistinguishable.\nThe embeddings are updated through the forward pass of the network, where GINConv aggregates features from the nodes' neighborhoods, refining the representations based on local and global structural information. The convolutional layers in our model are designed to enhance the expressiveness of node embeddings. They employ learnable linear transformations followed by a non-linear activation function, ReLU, The layers are parameterized to allow for the flexibility needed to capture the diverse interaction patterns found in cross-market data. The process can be mathematically expressed as:\n$H^{(k+1)} = MLP^{(k)} ((1 + \\epsilon^{(k)}). H^{(k)} + \\sum_{u \\in N(v)} H^{(k)})$ (1)\nWhere $H^{(k)}$ represents the node features at the kth iteration, N(v) denotes the set of neighbors of node v, and e is a learnable parameter that modulates the contribution of the node's features in the aggregation process. An MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) allows for a more profound combination of features before updating the node representation.\nIn practice, the embeddings are passed through a sequence of ReLU-activated GINConv layers, followed by a final MLP that combines user and item embeddings to predict the interaction score. The MLP consists of a linear layer that doubles the embedding size, a ReLU activation, and another linear layer that projects the combined embeddings down to a single score. This score is then passed through a sigmoid function to yield a probability, representing the likelihood of interaction between the user and the item. The process can be mathematically expressed as follows:\n$H^{(k+1)} = ReLU (GINConv (H^{(k)}, A) + \\epsilon^{(k)}. H^{(k)})$ (2)\nWhere $H^{(k)}$ denotes the hidden representations of nodes at the k-th layer, A is the adjacency matrix, and $\\epsilon^{(k)}$ is a learnable parameter that allows for distinguishing the node's features from its neighbors. The GINConv operation performs a sum aggregation of neighbor features followed by a linear transformation."}, {"title": "3.3 Model Optimization and Hyperparameters", "content": "The model concatenates user and item embeddings to predict interaction scores via a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

This table presents a breakdown of the datasets into three source markets (s1, s2, and s3) with a substantial number of users and interactions, highlighting the breadth of consumer data available for analysis. Additionally, two target markets (t1 and t2) are included, showcasing a more focused set of interactions that will be crucial for testing the transferability of our recommendation system. The variation in the number of users and interactions across these markets underscores the need for a recommendation system that can adapt to different levels of market data density and user-item interaction frequency.\nDataset Structure: For an effective CMR system, understanding the shared item count across markets is essential. Our analysis, depicted in Table 2, focuses on the item overlap between different markets. Importantly, it should be noted that there are no common users between these markets, underscoring the distinct nature of each market's user base and the unique challenge it presents in CMRs. This information can potentially assist in closing the gap between user preferences and expectations across different markets.\n4.1.1 Data Characteristics.

This methodology utilizes the XMRec dataset, a comprehensive collection of cross-market user-item interaction data. The real-world e-commerce scenarios provided by this dataset serve as a robust basis for assessing our system's effectiveness.\nWe measure the effectiveness of our model using Hit Rate (HR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), with a specific focus on the top-10 recommendations. HR directly measures whether the actual items of interest to users are captured within the top-N recommendations. Formally, HR is defined as:\n$HR = \\frac{1}{|U|} \\sum_{u \\in U} \\delta(p_u \\leq topN)$ (4)\nwhere d is the indicator function, pu denotes the rank position of the test item for user u, and U represents the user base.\nNDCG emphasizes the importance of the ranking order in the recommendation list by assigning more value to highly placed recommendations. This approach ensures that recommendations appearing earlier, and thus more likely to be seen by users, are given priority in the evaluation. Such a metric becomes crucial in scenarios where the position of a recommendation is as important as its presence. NDCG is defined as:\n$NDCG = \\frac{1}{|U|} \\sum_{u \\in U} \\frac{log_2(1 + \\delta(p_u))}{log_2 (p_u + 1)}$ (5)\nThese metrics, HR and NDCG, serve as the cornerstone of our evaluation, providing a dual-lens view of our model's ability to predict preferences accurately and rank them in a manner that aligns with user expectations and behaviors.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, quantum computers stand out as revolutionary and highly promising entities [1\u20134], extending their influence from cryptography and artificial intelligence to drug discovery, optimization problems and communications [1]. By harnessing the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics [5, 6], quantum computers possess the capacity to address intricate problems with unparalleled speed, surpassing the computational capabilities inherent in the most powerful classical computer known at present [1, 7\u201318].\nPhotonic quantum computers are currently prominent contenders in fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). These advanced architectures utilize photons as the medium for qubit encoding and manipulation [19], exhibiting inherent resilience against decoherence and noise, even at room temperature. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for scalable and FTQC. Photonic quantum computing also stands out for enabling the construction of modular, easily networked quantum computers, holding significant potential for practical applications [1].\nA key characteristic of photonic quantum computing lies in the encoding of qubits within the quantum state of light, unlocking a multitude of possibilities for quantum information processing (QIP). Quantum states of light have played a pivotal role since the inception of groundbreaking experiments in nonlocality and quantum teleportation [21, 22]. The benefits resulting from the encoding of qubits in single-photon states are numerous, including immunity to decoherence phenomena, the feasibility of conducting information processing at room temperature, and the capability to transmit photons through both optical fibers and free-space channels.\nEffective photonic QIP requires photonic processors to meet four key requirements. Firstly, they must be large-scale to handle complex problem-solving. Second, universality is essential, enabling the implementation of arbitrary transformations that map the system onto various problems. Achieving universality requires all-to-all connectivity (n inputs to n outputs) and full reconfigurability [27, 54\u201356]. Third, low loss is crucial to preserve the integrity of (quantum) information carried by the system. Finally, it is essential for a photonic processor to maintain quantum interference, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of quantum computations [57].\nThe integration of photonics into quantum computing holds transformative potential across various fields. In the last decade, significant strides in photonic quantum technologies have led to heightened system complexity, resulting in breakthroughs across diverse facets of quantum information science. Noteworthy achievements include the realization of quantum advantage [11, 12, 23] and the establishment of satellite quantum communications [24\u201326]. More recently, photonic processors have garnered increasing attention due to their versatile applications. These applications span QIP based on linear optics [27\u201342], quantum machine learning (QML) [43\u201347], quantum repeater networks [48\u201351], and radio-frequency signal processing [52, 53].\nFunctioning as tunable multimode interferometers capable of executing arbitrary linear optical transformations, photonic processors have been realized in various topologies, including triangular [27, 54], square [55], hexagonal [53], fan-like [44], rhomboidal [30], and quadratic configurations [52]. Photonic quantum computers are set to significantly enhance computational efficiency, surpassing classical systems in areas such as cryptography [58], advancing quantum chemistry and materials science [34, 59, 60]. These machines have the potential to revolutionize secure communication [61], refine molecular simulations critical for drug discovery [62, 63], and optimize complex logistical networks [64].\nIn this paper, we provide an in-depth review of key players in photonic quantum computing technologies (listed alphabetically) and their developed quantum photonic computers, delineating their efforts towards the realization of fault-tolerant photonic quantum computers.

In [53], P\u00e9rez et al. has designed, fabricated, and exhibited an integrated reconfigurable photonic signal processor [71\u201380]. The chip employs a configurable hexagonal silicon waveguide mesh structure, with each hexagonal side comprising two waveguides [100] that can be dynamically coupled or switched using a programmable tuneable basic unit (TBU) implemented through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) [55, 95, 99\u2013102]. iPronics systematically modified a 7-hexagon cell design to empirically manifest 21 distinct functionalities, encompassing asymmetrical FIR Mach-Zehnder filters [101, 102], ring cavities, complex CROW [103], SCISSOR [104], and ring-loaded MZI filters [101, 105, 106], as well as multiple input multiple output linear optic transformation devices (see Figure 1), notably a CNOT gate [53].

These algorithms are categorized into configuration methods that necessitate pre-characterization routines [122], as also outlined, and advanced optimization methods that not only eliminate this requirement but also address challenges arising from nonideal components characterized by nonhomogeneous loss distribution, power consumption [123, 124], phase offsets, optical crosstalk, and tuning crosstalk [112, 125\u2013128]. The authors further proposed and implemented self-configuration routines based on stochastic population-based methods, exemplified by Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [119] and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [129], for three distinct applications: an all-cross router, a beamsplitter, and an optical filter adaptable to a diverse range of spectral masks [121]. Through the amalgamation of computational optimization and photonics, this endeavor marks a noteworthy stride toward a novel paradigm in programmable photonics [93, 121].\nThe advancing maturity of integrated photonic technology has enabled the construction of progressively larger and intricate photonic circuits directly on chip surfaces [71\u201380].

Their quantum computer, Jiuzhang, successfully executed GBS [66, 67, 466, 520] within a mere 200 seconds. In contrast, the USTC research group estimated that the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer [68] would require a staggering 2.5 billion years to perform the same calculation. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, produces as many as 76 photon clicks in its outputs [11], resulting in an expansive state-space dimension of 1030. Notably, the sampling rate achieved by Jiuzhang claimed to surpasses the capabilities of state-of-the-art simulation strategies and supercomputers by an astonishing factor of approximately 1014.\nThe experimental configuration consists of a Verdi-pumped Mira 900 Ti:sapphire laser (also known as titanium-sapphire lasers, Ti: Al2O3 lasers) which is divided into 13 paths of equal intensity. The laser beams are directed onto 25 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) crystals, resulting in the generation of 25 two-mode squeezed states. A hybrid encoding technique is employed, effectively representing 50 single-mode squeezed states. To enhance the purity of the states, a 12nm filtering process raises the purity level from 98% to 99%. The 50 single-mode squeezed states are then fed into a 100-mode interferometer and subsequently detected by 100 single-photon detectors, each operating at an efficiency of 81%.\nFurthermore, in order to draw a comparison between the results achieved by the photonic quantum computing and classical computing systems, an analysis was carried out in [11] to determine the time required for two supercomputers to execute an equivalent GBS task. The Taihu-Light supercomputer was estimated to require approximately 8 \u00d7 1016 seconds (equivalent to 2.5 billion years), whereas Fugaku was projected to necessitate 2 \u00d7 1016 seconds (equivalent to 0.6 billion years [11]."}, {"title": "C.

The experiments involved a 144-mode photonic circuit, which yielded up to 113 photon detection events. The team achieved this feat through the development of a novel and scalable quantum light source based on stimulated emission of squeezed photons, boasting both near-unity purity and efficiency.\nRemarkably, Jiuzhang 2.0's photonic quantum computing capabilities translate into a substantial Hilbert space dimension of approximately 1043, leading to a sampling rate that is approximately 1024 times faster than brute-force simulations conducted on supercomputers. These developments represent a significant advancement in photonic quantum computing, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and furthering our understanding of quantum computational power.\nThe concept involves the generation of spontaneously produced photon pairs, resonating with the pump laser, to stimulate the emission of a second photon pair in a gain medium [69]. The experiment utilizes transform-limited laser pulses at a wavelength of 775 nm focused on PPKTP crystals to create two-mode squeezed states (TMSS). A concave mirror reflects the pump laser and the collinear TMSS photons back, serving as seeds for the second parametric process. Birefringence walk-off between horizontally and vertically polarized photons of the TMSS is compensated using a quarter-wave plate.

Fault tolerance in photonic MBQC architectures", "content": "Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) hinges on the effective correction of hardware errors during program execution. The practical realization of fault tolerance is contingent upon the specific characteristics of the underlying hardware. For example, circuit-based error correction serves as a framework suitable for hardware featuring deterministic gates, allowing the detection of errors through non-destructive ancilla-assisted measurements [146, 147]. Conversely, in the context of measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), error syndromes are constructed through destructive measurements on previously generated entangled states. MBQC is notably well-suited for hardware involving probabilistic entangling operations and destructive measurements [148\u2013151], including discrete variable photonic qubits [151, 155\u2013157] and continuous variable qubits [158, 159, 476].\nNumerous photonic MBQC architectures [149, 150, 155\u2013157, 160\u2013163] follow a two-stage approach to achieve fault tolerance. The first stage involves creating a sizable entangled resource state whose dimensions correspond to the complexity of the quantum computer program. Subsequently, in the second stage, destructive single-qubit measurements are applied to the prepared state to execute the program. A more streamlined approach in MBQC, referred to as fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC), was introduced in [151]. In FBQC, destructive two-qubit projective measurements in the Bell-state basis, known as Bell-state measurements [40] (BSMs) or fusions [164], are performed on constant-sized resource states. The study in [151] also presents FBQC architectures implementing the surface code, demonstrating high thresholds for both photon loss and fusion failures. Similar high thresholds have been achieved for other topological error correction codes using FBQC [165, 166]. The ability to generate entangled photonic resource states [167\u2013171], along with the high thresholds, suggests the suitability of photonic platforms for implementing FBQC architectures. However, the resource state size and photon loss thresholds remain challenging for current hardware.\nIn [145], ORCA Computing has explored alternative photonic architectures aimed at mitigating the hardware demands. Specifically, they have devised MBQC architectures that attain fault tolerance by fusing n resource states through measurements in the n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state basis, known as GHZ-state measurements (GSMs)."}, {"title": "D. ORCA's path to fault tolerance", "content": "Recently [145], ORCA Computing introduced innovative fault-tolerant architectures. Their focus lies on utilizing projective measurements in the GHZ basis in conjunction with constant-sized entangled resource states. They have meticulously developed linear-optical constructions of these architectures, wherein the GHZ-state measurements are subjected to encoding techniques aimed at mitigating errors stemming from photon loss and the inherent probabilistic characteristics of linear optics. Extensive simulations within their study indicate remarkable enhancements in single-photon loss thresholds when compared to the current state-of-the-art linear-optical architectures, specifically those employing encoded two-qubit fusion measurements with constant-sized resource states. ORCA Computing's findings in this endeavor underscore the potential of a resource-efficient route towards achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing based on photonic technologies.\nAn extensive array of research directions, extending beyond the scope of ORCA Computing's work presented in [145], encompasses various avenues. These include the investigation of alternative coding schemes for GHZ-state measurements as delineated in [172, 173], the exploration of leveraging biased error correction techniques as discussed in [165], the utilization of diverse resource states as highlighted in [166], and the examination of fusion network designs not rooted in conventional foliation principles as discussed in [174, 175].\nBeyond the realm of quantum computation, the encoded GHZ-state measurements developed by ORCA may also find pertinent applications in the domain of quantum communication. For instance, ORCA Computing exhibit potential utility in facilitating multipath routing strategies, which, in turn, hold the promise of enhancing entanglement rates within quantum networks, as elucidated in [176, 177].

PsiQuantum's approach to fault-tolerance", "content": "Fusion-based quantum computation The concept of FBQC has been introduced as a novel approach to quantum computing architecture [151]. Traditional quantum computing relies on deterministic unitary entangling gates [152\u2013154], which may not align naturally with certain physical systems, notably those in the realm of photonics [155, 156, 163, 164, 233\u2013243]. In contrast, FBQC leverages physical primitives inherently accessible in photonic setups, primarily entangling measurements termed \"fusions,\" performed on qubits originating from small, constant-sized entangled resource states. This approach not only addresses the probabilistic nature of photonic gates and inherent errors but also integrates quantum error correction techniques effectively [151].\nPsiQuantum's claims that this computational model can attain significantly higher fault tolerance thresholds than those documented in existing literature [151]. Specifically, the company proposes a robust design capable of withstanding a substantial 10.4% probability of photon loss during each fusion, equating to a mere 2.7% chance of losing each individual photon [151]. PsiQuantum also demonstrates a 43.2% barrier against fusion failure using a ballistic technique [244], compared to 14.9% previously reported in [150]. Notably, this architecture offers modularity and substantially reduces classical processing demands compared to earlier photonic quantum computing designs [150, 156, 163, 244].\nFlexible architectural design in fusion networks The physical architecture of FBQC, termed fusion networks, features a remarkable degree of flexibility, devoid of inherent temporal or spatial constraints. This flexibility allows for variations in the physical implementation of fusion networks. At the core of this architecture lies the concept of Resource State Generators (RSGs), physical devices responsible for generating resource states at specific spatial locations and time intervals. This concept is especially pertinent to photonic architectures [65]. The lifespan of a qubit is a critical factor to consider; it commences with its creation within an RSG, then proceeds through a fusion network router, which directs the qubits to their respective fusion locations [151]. Ultimately, each qubit undergoes a destructive measurement within a fusion. This relatively brief qubit lifespan proves advantageous for FBQC, especially within photonic architectures where optical loss remains a dominant source of physical errors [245\u2013247]."}, {"title": "C.

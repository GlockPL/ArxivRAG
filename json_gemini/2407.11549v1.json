Such models can simulate intricate behaviors and provide valuable insights into various aspects of human cognition. Decision-making is an example of cognitive processes that have long fascinated psychologists and economists. Economic theory posits that decisions assume a certain level of rationality and comprehension of available options (Gibbons, 1992). However, behaviorists contend that humans are not entirely rational but are influenced by psychological factors (Evans, 2014), cognitive biases (Daniel, 2017) and personality traits (Bayram and Aydemir, 2017).\nIn this paper, we aim to investigate the extent to which LLMs can simulate human decision-making across individuals with varying personality traits. We specifically focus on the negotiations scenarios. Evidence suggests that certain personality traits may give advantages in negotiation settings (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2018; Barry and Friedman, 1998; Amanatullah et al., 2008). For instance, agreeableness tend to result in a slight disadvantage in competitive negotiations while being an advantage in cooperative settings (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2018). In the context of LLM, we attempt to answer this long-standing question in psychology: \u201cHow do variations in personality traits affect the outcomes of negotiations?\"\nTo address this question, we propose a negotiation simulation framework incorporating LLM agents possessing synthesized personality traits and predefined negotiation objectives (Figure 1). For synthetic personalities, we use in-context learning to configure the agents with specific personality profiles. Here, the profiles are based on Big-Five personality theory (Costa Jr and McCrae, 1995; John et al., 1999). For negotiation objectives, we give LLM agents instructions that specify the negotiation task and goals. The LLM agents then engage in a negotiation by exchanging offers in the form of dialogue. Specifically, we consider a competitive bargaining scenario between a buyer and a seller agent. In each round t of the negotiation dialogue, we extract the offered price and strategy (if any) made in the dialogue utterances for evaluation and analysis.\nBy varying the personality traits of the agents, we observe changes in the negotiation outcomes and behavioral patterns. We investigated which personality traits lead to better/worse outcomes. More importantly, we want to see whether the LLM-based simulation results align with the findings of previous research conducted on human subjects. Our experimental results show that the tendencies in LLM-based simulation generally align with those observed in human experiments. In addition, a case study based on synthesized bargaining dialogue reveals intriguing behavioral patterns such as deceiving behaviors, emotional appeal, and take-it-or-leave-it strategies. The results obtained in this work illustrate that LLM can not only mimics styles of talking but is also capable of capturing human decision-making patterns.\nThe contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we propose a simulation framework that leverages LLM agents with linguistic and economic capabilities. Second, we offer insights into the effect of Big-Five personality traits on simulated negotiation outcomes and compare these findings to empirical psychology experiments."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Recent advances in LLMs allowed the development of systems capable of emulating various human behaviors, emotions, and personalities (Akata et al., 2023; Serapio-Garc\u00eda et al., 2023).\nPrevious research has predominantly utilized personality tests for evaluation purposes. However, issues of data contamination can arise (Oren et al., 2023). Specifically, if a dataset from a personality questionnaire is employed in training a LLM, the resulting scores may not accurately reflect whether the LLM's behavioral responses correspond with the personality described in the prompt. In this paper, we adopt an indirect, economic, analysis of negotiation scenarios to see whether the personality instruction to LLMs really translates to genuine behavioral change of the LLM agents.\nThe target behavior are akin to decision-making, which is a particular type of human behavior that is still challenging to reproduce with LLM agents because it relies on reasoning capabilities that they lack (Tamkin et al., 2021). Decision-making generally entails choosing an action from various options in response to a particular situation, often reflecting personal preferences or beliefs (Simon, 1990). Moreover, real-world decisions are challenging because they are susceptible to environmental and cognitive constraints (Phillips-Wren and Adya, 2020). Narrowing down the scope of decision-making problems, we focus on negotiation as an example that we claim could be studied comprehensibly using LLMs. In a negotiation, two parties interact with each other to exchange bids and attempt to reach a mutual agreement (Raiffa, 1982; Jennings et al., 2001). Looking at negotiations from the classical economics perspective, we often presuppose several assumptions, such as rationality (Evans, 2014). Such assumptions often fail when the negotiations are conducted through natural language, which conveys various aspects that cannot be studied economically, such as emotions or personality traits. There is in fact evidence showing the effect of Big-Five personality traits on decisions (Bayram and Aydemir, 2017; Urieta et al., 2021; Erjavec et al., 2019; Toledo and Carson, 2023; El Othman et al., 2020). In negotiations, certain personality traits are considered disadvantageous (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2018; Amanatullah et al., 2008). Extraversion and agreeableness, for example, constitute liabilities in competitive bargaining"}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "This section introduces our simulation framework with LLM agents possessing synthesized personalities. In Section 3.1, we formulate the negotiation model and the used syntax. In Section 3.2, we introduce the method to configure a LLM negotiations by providing the instructions that set personality traits and negotiation objectives. We then describe the process of simulating negotiation dialogues with the LLM agents in Section 3.3.\n3.1 Negotiation Model\nWe consider a classical bargaining scenario in which a buyer and a seller negotiate over the price of an item or product. Typically, the buyer aims to reduce the purchase price while the seller seeks to maximize it, resulting in the competitive nature of the negotiation scenario. This is also an example of a zero-sum game in which one party's gain leads to the other party's loss, showing the competitive nature of the task (Gibbons, 1992). In our LLM-based negotiation simulations, the seller and the buyer are LLM agents. Since our goal is to study the effect of personality traits on negotiation, we define the seller and buyer agents in terms of their psychological and economic profiles as in (Eq. 1).\nSeller s\n= (\u03a8s, us)\nBuyer b = (\u03a8b, ub)\n(1)\nThe psychological profiles \u03c8s and \u03c8b will be instantiated with predefined personality traits following the Big-Five model of personality. Such model decomposes human personality into five dimensions: openness (OPE), conscientiousness (CON), extraversion (EXT), agreeableness (AGR), and neuroticism (NEU) (Costa Jr and McCrae, 1995; John et al., 1999). Each dimension is a spectrum with negative and positive polarities. The five dimensions encompass a comprehensive range of human personality patterns. The economic profiles of the agents are reflected in their utility functions, denoted by us for sellers and ub for buyers. A utility function is a mathematical way to describe the preferences or objectives of the agents depending on whether they are minimizing (buyer) or maximizing the price (seller) (Gibbons, 1992).\nThe seller and the buyer negotiate in a dialogue D around a product. The dialogue is a sequence of T utterances D = {d1, d2, ..., dT}. Each utterance dt is associated with a negotiation state st and the current offer price pt.\n3.2 LLM Agent Configuration\nWe configure an LLM agent with specific personality traits by introducing a personality instruction (Section 3.2.1) and a negotiation objective instruction (Section 3.2.2), with in-context learning.\n3.2.1 Personality Traits Instruction\nThe idea is to attribute to an agent a synthetic personality profile. That is, an agent k, with k \u2208 {s, b}, possesses a 5-dimensional personality profile \u03c8k defined as in (Eq. 2).\n\u03c8k = (\u03c8OPE, \u03c8CON, \u03c8EXT, \u03c8AGR, \u03c8NEU)\n\u03c8k \u2208 L5\nL = {\u2212, +} \u2297 {Low, Moderate, High}\n(2)\nEach component of \u03c8k represents the polarity (negative or positive) and degree (low, moderate or high) of each personality dimension (Tian et al., 2018). For instance, \u03c8AGR takes on one of the values in L, which respectively represents a spectrum from highly disagreeable (\u2013 \u2013 \u2013), moderately disagreeable (--), lowly disagreeable (-), lowly agreeable (+), moderately agreeable (++), and highly agreeable (+ + +). For example, one could define a personality profile \u03c8k by randomly sampling from the personality space L5 a vector equal to (OPE+, CON---, EXT-, AGR+, NEU++).\nFollowing previous work, we use personality-describing adjectives to set the personality traits (Serapio-Garc\u00eda et al., 2023). We use the list of 70 bipolar adjective pairs proposed by Goldberg (1992), which are adjectives that statistically correlate with certain Big-Five personality traits. For instance, prompting an LLM with adjectives such as unsure and irresponsible is likely to result in utterances with negative conscientiousness traits. For each personality dimension in \u03c8k, we randomly pick n adjectives out of all the personality-describing adjectives associated with the polarity of the given dimension. Further, we apply the modifiers based on the degree of the personality traits. We use \u201cvery\u201d as a modifier for a high degree and \"a bit\" for a low degree. No modifier is used for the moderate degree. Following this process, we use 5 \u00d7 n adjectives associated with\n3.2.2 Negotiation Objective Instructions\nTo configure the economic profiles of the LLM negotiation agents us and ub in (Eq. 1), we incorporate negotiation objective instructions that define the negotiation goals of each agent. Specifically, we focus on a bargaining scenario where the seller agent aims to sell the product at a higher price, reaching its ideal price as closely as possible (Raiffa, 1982). Conversely, the buyer agent seeks to secure a deal at a lower price and strives to achieve its ideal target price. The instructions are the following:\n\u2022 (Buyer) Act as a buyer and try to strike a deal for a ${P} with a lower price through conversation. You would like to pay for pb. Your reply should not be too long.\n\u2022 (Seller) Act as a seller that sells a ${P}, bargains with the buyer to get a higher deal price. Your reply should not be too long. Your listing price for this ${P} is ps. The detail of the product is the following: ${D}.\nHere, P and D are the product name and a short description of the product of the negotiations. (See Appendix A.1) These linguistic instructions could theoretically be mapped into utility functions, which will later be used to evaluate negotiations. We avoid making assumptions about the shape of the utility functions, as the behaviors of the agents are primarily shaped by the LLM instructions, which may not follow any specific mathematical representation of their preferences.\n3.3 Negotiation Simulation\nUsing the methods in Section 3.2, we configure the buyer LLM agent and the seller LLM agent and conduct a negotiation simulation between them. The seller and buyer agents exchange offers, with the seller kick-starting the conversation with the fixed utterance \u201cHi, how can I help you?\". After an utterance dt is generated, the response is fed to the other agent as a prompt. The process continues until the termination condition is met. In this fashion, we collect a negotiation dialogue D = {d1, d2, ..., dT}. Following (Fu et al., 2023), we introduce a dialogue state detector to extract negotiation-related information from each utterance. First, we detect the negotiation state st of dt, which is one of the following states:\n\u2022 Offer: the agent makes a price offer.\n\u2022 Ponder: the agent considers whether to accept or reject the other agent's offer.\n\u2022 Accept: the agent accepts the current offer.\n\u2022 Deal-break: the agent refuses the last offer or walks away from the negotiation.\n\u2022 Chit-chat: Utterances with intent not directly related to the negotiation, such as greetings.\nIn addition, we extract the current offer price pt and the strategy of each utterance dt. After generating each utterance, the dialogue state detector takes dt and its context (previous h utterances) as input and extracts the negotiation state st, current offer price pt (if any), and strategy of of the current speaker in free text form. In this work, we use another LLM as the dialogue state detector.\nFor the termination condition of the negotiation is based on the detected negotiation states. We terminate the negotiation dialogue if an Accept or a Deal-break is reached. Also, we set a length limit of T = Tmax of the dialogue. If the length of the generated dialogue reaches this limit, we terminate the process and automatically regard it as a failed negotiation.\""}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we provide details on the experimental settings (Section 4.1) and the evaluation metrics (Section 4.2).\n4.1 Experimental Settings\nLLM Agents For the buyer and seller agents, we adopt GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) (OpenAI, 2023) as the choice of the LLM. We also conducted experiments based on Llama 3 and GPT-3.5. which could be found in the Appendix A.3. The prompts of the agents can be found in Appendix A.1.\nNegotiation Variables We used the CraigsList-Bargain dataset (He et al., 2018) to set several negotiation variables. It is a commonly used dataset of negotiation, consisting of bargaining dialogues in an online platform. For each negotiation entry in the dataset, we extract the name and the description of the product, and the 'listing price' of the seller and a 'target price' of the buyer. We use the listing price as the ideal price ps for the seller and the target price as the ideal price pb for the buyer. Note that an agent's ideal price is not disclosed to the other party in our setting.\nPersonality Instruction For each agent k, we first generate a personality profile by randomly sampling from the personality space L5 (Eq. 2). We then select n = 3 personality-describing adjectives associated with the sampled polarity and degree for each Big-Five dimension. The 5 \u00d7 n adjectives across all dimensions are then randomly shuffled and given as an instruction to agent k.\nDialogue Simulation For the dialogue simulation process, we set a maximum length of TMAX = 20 utterances. We use GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613) and the function calling module provided by OpenAI to implement the negotiation state detector. The full dialogue context are given to the negotiation state detection as input. The prompt for negotiation state detection can be found in Appendix A.1. We collect a total of 1499 negotiation dialogues with our simulation methodology.\n4.2 Evaluation of the Negotiations\nWe mainly evaluate the negotiations in terms of utility and whether the negotiations are successful or not (Baarslag et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2023). Recall that utility functions serve as mathematical tools for quantifying the quality of decision outcomes (Simon, 1990). In our study we adopt a number of economic metric commonly used to evaluate negotiations (Baarslag et al., 2016).\nIntrinsic Utility (IU) Based on the negotiation instructions, the utility of buyer and seller for a particular price p is expressed in (Eq. 3).\nus, ub : R+ \u2192 [0, 1]\nus(p) =\np \u2212 ps\nps \u2212 p\u0304s\nub(p) =\np\u0304b \u2212 p\np\u0304b \u2212 pb\n(3)\nAs illustrated in the example of Figure 1, the prices p, and p\u0304s are the seller's reservation price and initial price, and p\u044c and p\u0304b are the buyer's initial price and reservation price. Here, p\u0304s is the price the seller is willing to accept without losing money. Similarly, the buyer's reservation price p\u0304b is the maximum price it is willing to pay. Generally, the agreement zones of the agents are defined as the intersection between [p\u0304s, p\u0304b] and [ps, pb]. We set p and pb by assuming that the agreement zone is defined as a percentage of [p\u0304s, p\u0304b]. Second, [ps, pb] and [p\u0304s, p\u0304b] are private to the agents. It is important to note that an off p is not guaranteed to fall within the intervals due to the language model.\nJoint Utility (JU) We measure the fairness of negotiation outcomes using a joint utility function (Eq. 4) inspired by Nash solution for bargaining problems (Luce and Raiffa, 1989).\nusb(p) =\n(p \u2212 ps)(p\u0304b \u2212 p)\n(p\u0304b \u2212 ps)2\n(4)\nSuch quantity is proportional to the product of the buyer's and seller's intrinsic utilities. Higher joint utility values indicate that the outcome if fair for both agents. For instance, an agreement price yielding a utility of 0.5 for both agents is more equitable than an outcome yielding 0.8 and 0.2.\nConcession Rate (CR) Given the negotiation objectives, the offers could be assumed to undergo some form of decay akin to concessions. That is, an agent k will make an offer at round t \u2208 [1, T] based on a discounted utility function (Eq. 5), with concession rate ck \u2208 [0, 1].\nuk(pt) \u221d pk + (p\u0304k \u2212 pk) \u00d7\n(\nT \u2212 t\nT\n)ck\n(5)"}, {"title": "5 Results and Analysis", "content": "In this section, we conduct an analysis of the negotiation outcomes based on the dialogues generated in the negotiation simulations.\n5.1 Negotiation Outcomes and Personality\nFirst, we analyze the relationships between the negotiation outcomes and the personality traits of agents. Table 2 illustrates the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between the economic metrics introduced in section 4.2 and Big-Five personality traits.\u00b9 Along the extraversion (EXT) dimension, we observed that extroverted buyer agents tend to result in more successful negotiations (\u03c1 = 0.072**). On the other hand, an extroverted seller agent tend to result in a slightly higher joint utility, which indicates a fairer outcome for both negotiation participants. Among the five dimensions, agreeableness (AGR) has the strongest impact on negotiation outcomes, especially for the seller. We found that being agreeable leads to a disadvantage in bargaining in terms of intrinsic utility (\u03c1 = \u22120.262**). However, agreeableness correlated positively with joint utility (\u03c1 = 0.118**), concession rates (\u03c1 = 0.261**), and negotiation success (\u03c1 = 0.052**), pointing to a propensity for cooperative behavior that benefits both negotiating parties. Also, agents tend to reach an agreement with fewer number of negotiation rounds (\u03c1 = -0.223**) with mutually satisfying outcomes. This aligns with the positive effect of agreeableness on the negotiators' distributive outcomes reported in (Sass and Liao-Troth, 2015). Aligning with previous findings (Barry and Friedman, 1998), we observed a positive correlation of conscientiousness (CON) and negotiation performance, especially for seller (intrinsic utility, \u03c1 = 0.127**). Conscientiousness is also manifested in the negotiation style of not willing to concede (\u03c1 = -0.097**) on the seller side, and a lengthier negotiation on the buyer side (\u03c1 = 0.083**). In psychology literature, neuroticism (NEU) and openness (OPE) are expected to play a less predominant role in negotiations (Falc\u00e3o et al., 2018). Similarly, we only observe some very weak correlation (with magnitude < 0.1) along these dimensions. For instance, neurotic sellers tend to make less concessions (\u03c1 = -0.074**) and have a slightly higher utility gain (\u03c1 = 0.064**), while open-minded sellers lead to enhanced joint gain (\u03c1 = 0.063**). These results points to how personality traits could impact the outcomes of negotiations with different effects observed based on the role of the negotiator.\n5.2 Negotiation Strategies\nSo far, the buyer and the seller were defined on the basis of personality traits and economic preferences. We now look at their strategies and the consequent effects on the joint negotiation outcomes. This investigation could answer questions of the type \u201cWhat would be the optimal strategy for a buyer, who happens to be neurotic, when facing a disagreeable and conscientious seller?\u201d.\nAt each around, each agent adopts a specific strategy \u03c3\u03c4 that results in some price pt, inferred from state st. Given that the outcome of a successful negotiation is the final price pdeal, we are interested in the relationship between the adopted strategies and the joint utility of the agreement price, usb(pdeal). We manually inspected the strategies that occur more than 20 times within the entire negotiations and construct a sets of strategy categories the agents. We then conducted a linear regression between the strategy categories and the resulting joint utility values as illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"title": "5.3 Case Study", "content": "We conducted qualitative analysis of the negotiation simulation results. Table 3 shows two distinct examples of dialogues generated in the negotiation simulations.\nIn the example on the first row, the seller and the buyer are negotiating over a stereo speaker. When the buyer asked about the price, the seller provides a price ($80) that is higher than the listing price ($50), and ends up striking a deal at $60, which is higher than the listing price. We observed this kind of deceiving behavior in the negotiations involving disagreeable agents. The second example is a negotiation on a second-hand iPhone. We can see that buyer tries to emotionally appeal to the seller by mentioning her 'my elderly parent' but the seller is not persuaded and adopts a \u2018take-it-or-leave-it' strategy. Despite the constant effort of the buyer to find a common ground with the seller, the later is not willing to change the offer price ($160). We observe more similar \u2018hardball' negotiation strategies with disagreeable and close-minded agents. At the end of the negotiation, the buyer concedes and accept the seller's offer. The above examples showcase a range of negotiation behaviors such as deception, emotional appeal, hard-headed behavior (Baarslag et al., 2016). This illustrates how specific personality traits influence negotiation styles."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This study introduced a novel simulation framework that integrates language model (LLM) agents equipped with synthesized Big-Five personality traits. These agents were deployed in traditional bargaining scenarios to simulate negotiation processes.

Furthermore, a detailed case study of synthesized bargaining dialogues highlighted distinct behaviors, including deceit and compromise, augmenting our understanding of linguistic and economic agent interactions.

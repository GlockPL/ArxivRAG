One of the critical components in 5G NR is the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH), which facilitates the initial ac- cess procedure for User Equipment (UE) to establish a connection with the base station (gNB).\nPRACH plays a vital role in enabling UEs to identify them- selves and initiate communication with the gNB by trans- mitting a preamble sequence. This process is essential for maintaining seamless connectivity and efficient net- work operation. However, the presence of cell-interference, which occurs when multiple UEs attempt to access the net- work simultaneously, poses significant challenges to the accurate detection of PRACH signals.\nTraditional methods for PRACH detection rely on correlation-based techniques, which can be susceptible to interference and noise, leading to false alarms and missed detections. To address these challenges, this paper pro- poses a novel approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance the detection performance of PRACH under cell-interference conditions.\nCNNs have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, particularly in image and signal processing, due to their ability to capture complex patterns and spatial dependencies. By leveraging CNNs for PRACH detection, this study aims to improve the robustness and accuracy of the detection process, thereby reducing the initial access latency and enhancing overall network performance.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec- tion 2 provides a comprehensive background on 5G NR PRACH and related work. Section 3 outlines the proposed CNN-based PRACH detection model. Section 4 describes the dataset generation and preparation methods. Section 5 details the training and testing methodology. Section 6 presents the results and analysis. Finally, Section 7 con- cludes the paper and discusses future research directions."}, {"title": "2 Background and Related Work", "content": "The 5G New Radio (NR) introduces significant advance- ments in wireless communication, with the Physical Ran- dom Access Channel (PRACH) playing an important role in enabling the initial attachment of User Equipment (UE) to a Base Station (gNB) [1]. The PRACH allows UEs to send a preamble to the gNB, facilitating the identification and synchronization processes necessary for subsequent communication. This section provides an overview of the 5G NR PRACH procedures, the challenges posed by cell interference, and the existing approaches to PRACH detection, emphasizing the transition from conventional methods to AI/ML-based solutions."}, {"title": "2.1 5G Random Access Procedures", "content": "The 5G NR specifications support two types of Random Access (RA) procedures: contention-based and contention- free [1]. In the contention-based RA (CBRA) procedure, UEs randomly select a preamble from a pool, while in the contention-free RA (CFRA) procedure, the gNB assigns specific preambles to UEs. The CBRA procedure involves a four-step process, starting with the transmission of a randomly selected preamble by the UE on the PRACH (Msg 1), followed by the gNB's response with a Random Access Response (RAR, Msg 2). This is succeeded by scheduled uplink and downlink transmissions (Msgs 3 and 4), completing the RA process [2].\nWith this information, the UE can transmit the PRACH preamble using the resources indicated by the Next- Generation NodeB (gNB) during the transmission of SIB2. The transmission of the PRACH is associated with the RA-RNTI (Random Access RNTI).\nWhen an UE enters a new cell, it has no prior knowledge of the gNB. After identifying the optimal SSB (Synchro- nization Signal Block) through downlink synchronization, the UE transmits the PRACH containing its information, based on the best time index of the SSB. Fig.1 illustrates the interactions between the UE and the gNB during the initial access procedure [3].\nRandom access process is described in Fig.1. The UE se- lects randomly a preamble from a list of parameters broad- casted through the SIB2 and transmits it in the PRACH with an initial power result of a basic downlink pathloss estimation. If there is no answer from the gNB, the UE makes a retry with higher power level."}, {"title": "2.2 PRACH Sequence Generation", "content": "PRACH sequence generation begins with the selection of a base sequence, typically a Zadoff-Chu sequence known for its Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) properties [4]. The sequence which is which an OFDM symbol, built with a Cyclic Prefix (CP) undergoes a cyclic shift to embed the Random Access Preamble ID (RAPID). The gNB decodes the received sequence by correlating it with the known base sequence, estimating both the RAPID and the Timing Advance (TA), which indicates the propa- gation delay induced by the UE's distance from the gNB [5]. Refer to Fig.2 for the NR-PRACH structure.\nThe preamble sequence length is set to a prime number of 839, there are 838 sequences with optimal cross-correlation properties. The uth (0 \u2264 u \u2264 837) root Zadoff-Chu se- quence is defined by (Nzc is the length of the Zadoff-Chu sequence):\n$X_u(n) = e^{\\frac{-ju\\pi n(n+1)}{N_{zc}}}, 0 \\leq n \\leq N_{zc}-1$  (1)\nFrom the uthroot ZC sequence, random access preambles with Zero Correlation Zones (ZCZ) of length Nzc - 1 are defined by Cyclic Shifts (CS) according to [6]:\n$x_{u,v} (n) = x_u ((n + C_v) mod N_{zc}),$ (2)\nwhere C is the cyclic shift, and Nzc is the cyclic shift offset. This paper adopts preamble format 0 in the 5G-NR, which generates from a 839 point ZC sequence which is specifically designed for contention-based access, where multiple UEs may attempt to access the network simulta- neously."}, {"title": "2.3 Conventional Approaches for PRACH Detection", "content": "Traditional PRACH receivers rely on correlation-based techniques to detect the RAPID and estimate the TA. These methods involve correlating the received signal with all possible base sequences, identifying the sequence that max- imizes the correlation value. The position of the correla- tion peak indicates the RAPID and TA. However, these methods require setting thresholds to distinguish between correct and incorrect detections, which can be challenging under varying signal conditions and lead to false alarms or missed detections [7, 8]. Additionally, cell interference and multipath effects further complicate the accurate detection of PRACH signals [5].\nFigure 3 illustrates the block diagram of the NR-PRACH receiver in 5G-NR networks. It is impotant to understand the PRACH signal processing flow in 5G-NR networks. Each module in the diagram plays a critical role in extract- ing and identifying random access signals, and interference at any stage can compromise detection quality. By integrat- ing CNN techniques, the goal is to enhance the robustness and accuracy of these processing steps against interference, thereby optimizing the overall performance of the PRACH receiver."}, {"title": "2.4 AI Applications in Wireless Communications", "content": "The Table 1 categorizes the relevant literature into four distinct and meaningful categories.

This parallel processing reduces the error propagation between sequential detection steps, enhancing overall detection accuracy [5].

These parameters are adjusted based on the results of cross-validation phases during training."}, {"title": "5.4 Model Training Results", "content": "The results of the model training show the accuracy and validation loss measured over several epochs. The figures below illustrate the evolution of accuracy and loss during training.\nFigure 6 shows the evolution of the training and validation accuracy of the neural network model over 30 epochs. The training accuracy curve increases rapidly at the beginning and reaches about 95% after ten epochs, then stabilizes. In contrast, the validation accuracy curve increases more slowly and stabilizes around 75-80%. This gap between the training and validation curves indicates some overfitting, where the model performs very well on the training data but less so on the validation data. Note that model validation model quickly adapts to the training data but struggles to generalize this knowledge to unseen validation data.\nThe joint analysis of Figures 6 and 7 reinforces the di- agnosis of overfitting. The rapid convergence and high training accuracy values combined with an almost negli- gible training loss show that the model has learned the specific patterns of the training data. However, the inabil- ity to achieve similar performance on the validation data suggests that the model has memorized the training data rather than learning generalizable features.\nFigure 8 provides an overview of the performance of our CNN model in terms of PRACH interference classification metrics and processing time (training and inference). An accuracy of 70.5%, precision of 75.6%, recall of 80.5%, and F1 score of 78.0% suggest that the model has a good ability to correctly identify relevant samples with partic- ularly high recall. This means that the model is effective at detecting true positives (interference). However, the relatively lower accuracy compared to other metrics sug- gests that the model might still confuse some samples. The F1 score, which combines precision and recall, shows an overall balanced performance at 78.0%. The relatively long training time (144.37 seconds) reflects the model's complexity and the volume of data used for training. In contrast, the very short inference time (3.69 seconds) in- dicates that once trained, the model can make predictions quickly and efficiently, which is necessary for real-time applications.\nFigures 9 and 10 provide an evaluation of the model's per- formance in terms of training and validation accuracy and loss over 30 epochs. The specificity of this analysis lies in the fact that the model was trained with prachInterf.SeqIdx = 22 and inference was performed with prachInterf.SeqIdx = 3, introducing a change in conditions between training and inference.\nFigure 9 shows that the training accuracy increases rapidly, reaching nearly 100% within the first few epochs and then stabilizing. In contrast, the validation accuracy increases more slowly and stabilizes around 75%. The difference between the training and validation curves indicates over- fitting, already identified in the results of Figures 6 and 7. Again, the model learns the training data very well but struggles to generalize to new data, especially due to the change in SeqIdx between training and inference.\nFigure 10 shows the training loss, which decreases rapidly to almost zero values after only a few epochs. In contrast, the validation loss decreases more slowly and stabilizes around 0.3. The polynomial trend line fitted to the training loss shows a rapid decrease, confirming that the model has learned to minimize error on the training data.\nThe change in the value of SeqIdx (which translates to a change in the cell) between training and inference in- troduces a variation in the data characteristics, making it difficult for the model to generalize correctly. Overfitting is clearly visible with a divergence between the training and validation curves."}, {"title": "5.5 Limitations and Future Directions", "content": "In this section, we examine the inherent constraints of our current study and explore opportunities for future improve- ment to enhance the robustness and efficiency of PRACH signal detection in highly interfered communication envi- ronments."}, {"title": "5.5.1 Study Limitations", "content": "While the results of our study are promising, showing an accuracy of 84.7%, a recall of 92.5%, and an F1 score of 88.4% achieved by the CNN model for PRACH detection in the presence of interference, it is important to recognize several limitations that might influence the interpretation of our results and the generalization of our conclusions. The key technical, methodological and contextual limitations identified in our study are listed below:\n\u2022 Technical Limitations: Complexity of channel models, idealized simulation parameters and lim- ited computing capacity affecting training.\n\u2022 Methodological Limitations: Insufficient data sampling and evaluation methods that may not fully assess model robustness.\n\u2022 Contextual Limitations: Applicability in real sce- narios and the need for model adaptability to new technological standards.\nThese limitations highlight the importance of continuing research in this field by developing more robust models and using more diverse validation methods that can better simulate varied operational conditions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to extend future studies to include sensitivity analyses and stress tests to better understand the scope and limits of the proposed model."}, {"title": "5.5.2 Future Directions", "content": "This study opens several interesting avenues for future re- search and practical improvements. First, extending the training dataset to include a greater diversity of PRACH sequences (different SeqIdx) could significantly improve the model's robustness and generalization. By incorporat- ing varied preamble sequences, the model would be better equipped to handle variations encountered in real scenarios, thereby increasing its reliability. Additionally, applying advanced regularization techniques, such as dropout, L2 regularization, and data augmentation, could help reduce the observed overfitting, thereby improving the model's overall performance on unseen validation data."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we proposed and evaluated a Convolu- tional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for detect- ing PRACH signals under interference conditions in 5G- NR networks. The proposed CNN model demonstrated a high recall rate of 92.5%, indicating its effectiveness in identifying interference-affected signals. The precision and F1 scores were also high, at 84.7% and 88.4% respectively, highlighting a balanced performance in detection accuracy and reliability. The model showed a certain degree of over- fitting, as evidenced by the divergence between training and validation curves. This suggests the need for further improvements, such as enhanced regularization techniques, to improve generalization to unseen data. Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicated the model's robustness in differ- ent interference scenarios. Particularly, the variation in sequence indices (SeqIdx) between training and inference phases was found to impact performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse and continuous evaluation.\nThe successful application of CNNs for PRACH interfer- ence detection underlines the potential for AI/ML tech- niques to enhance the robustness and efficiency of 5G networks. This approach can be integrated into real-time network operations, contributing to more reliable and effi- cient mobile communication systems."}]}

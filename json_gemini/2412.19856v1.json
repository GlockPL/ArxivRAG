INTRODUCTION", "content": "HE advancement of remote sensing technologies has transformed how we analyze the Earth's surface, facilitating applications in urban planning, agriculture, disaster management, and environmental monitoring [1], [2], [3]. Central to this is Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which effectively manage and visualize spatial data, allowing for informed decision-making. However, traditional remote sensing techniques face challenges due to the increasing volume and complexity of multi-spectral or hyper-spectral data, resulting in high-dimensional datasets that are difficult to analyze [4], [5], [6]. Conventional methods often struggle with essential tasks such as classification and temporal change detection, leading to reduced accuracy and insights. The integration of GIS data is also underutilized, limiting exploration of spatial relationships [7]. To address these issues, there is a pressing need for sophisticated approaches. The fusion of deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), with GIS presents a viable solution [8], [9], [10]. CNNs effectively handle spatial patterns, while LSTMs excel in analyzing sequential data, making them suitable for temporal change detection [11]. This combined approach enhances the accuracy of remote sensing analysis. Additionally, optimization algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) can fine-tune model parameters, further improving performance.\nRemote sensing and GIS have long been used together to provide detailed spatial analysis. The role of GIS is crucial in managing spatial data, offering geospatial analysis tools that help interpret and visualize the results of remote sensing. Recent advances in remote sensing have expanded the capabilities of both fields. For example, Fang et al. (2019) [12], [13], [14] used a ResNet-50-based CNN to detect man-made reservoirs from Landsat 8 images with high accuracy, while Chen et al. (2022) [15] applied real-time garbage detection using small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs), achieving over 91% accuracy in natural reserves. Additionally, Kakhani et al. (2024) [16] introduced SSL-SoilNet, a transformer-based framework leveraging self-supervised learning for predicting soil organic carbon, significantly improving digital soil mapping accuracy.Himali and Raja (2024) [17] used ResNet and random forest classifiers to identify tree species from Sentinel-2A images, achieving a 90.75% accuracy rate [18].\nThe integration of deep learning in remote sensing has led to advancements in classification, segmentation, and feature extraction. Rodriguez-Garlito et al. (2023) [19] developed a CNN-based method for tracking invasive aquatic plants in the Guadiana River using multispectral remote sensing, while Li et al. (2022) [20] proposed an attention-based GAN (SRAGAN) to improve spatial resolution in remote sensing images. Additionally, Zhang et al. (2019) [21] employed multi-scale dense networks for hyperspectral image classification, advancing land cover analysis. Optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been applied to enhance the performance of machine learning models in remote sensing. These algorithms are particularly useful in tuning the hyperparameters of deep learning models to achieve optimal performance. For instance, Complementing these studies, Meng et al. (2024) [22] introduced a novel GAN-based method for super-resolution in remote sensing images, and Yin et al. (2023) [23] developed a vector mapping method for buildings using joint semantic-geometric learning. Zhu et al. (2021) [24] tackled urban mixed scenes using a scene unmixing framework based on nonnegative matrix factorization. The fusion of deep learning with GIS is an emerging area of research that aims to leverage the strengths of both fields [25]. Current approaches have shown promising results in enhancing spatial analysis, but gaps remain in fully integrating temporal and spatial data. By addressing these gaps, the fusion of deep learning and GIS has the potential to improve remote sensing image analysis across various applications, from environmental monitoring to urban planning.\nThe primary objective of this paper is to develop an advanced framework for remote sensing image analysis by fusing deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This framework aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, including poor classification accuracy, challenges in handling temporal data, and the underutilization of spatial relationships within GIS. To optimize the performance of the deep learning models, optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) will be utilized [26]. The structure of the paper includes a comprehensive literature review in Section II, an outline of the proposed methodology detailing the integration of CNNs and LSTMs with GIS in Section III, the presentation of the experimental setup and datasets in Section IV, a discussion of the results and their implications in Section V, and a conclusion in Section VI that highlights future research directions."}, {"title": "II. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "Remote sensing plays a vital role in monitoring and ana-lyzing the Earth's surface for various applications, including urban planning, agriculture, and environmental protection. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with remote sensing data enhances spatial analysis but poses signif-icant challenges. High-dimensional multi-spectral and hyper-spectral images can overwhelm traditional methods, making efficient processing and meaningful extraction difficult [27]. Conventional machine learning struggles with classification and segmentation due to complexities like inter-class similarity and intra-class variability. Existing methods often fail to ana-lyze temporal changes, limiting real-time applications such as disaster management. The underutilization of GIS data further restricts insights from spatial relationships [28]. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer potential, their effectiveness is often compro-mised by poor hyperparameter tuning and architecture choices. Optimization algorithms can enhance deep learning outcomes, but traditional methods may struggle in high-dimensional spaces [29]. The presented equations in the problem for-mulation provide a quantitative framework to assess model performance, address data complexities, and emphasize the need for effective temporal analysis [30].

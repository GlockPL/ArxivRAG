{"title": "Modeling Information Narrative Detection and Evolution on Telegram during the Russia-Ukraine War", "authors": ["Patrick Gerard", "Svitlana Volkova", "Louis Penafiel", "Kristina Lerman", "Tim Weninger"], "abstract": "Following the Russian Federation's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a multitude of information nar- ratives emerged within both pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian communities online. As the conflict progresses, so too do the information narratives, constantly adapting and influenc- ing local and global community perceptions and attitudes. This dynamic nature of the evolving information environment (IE) underscores a critical need to fully discern how narra- tives evolve and affect online communities. Existing research, however, often fails to capture information narrative evolu- tion, overlooking both the fluid nature of narratives and the internal mechanisms that drive their evolution. Recognizing this, we introduce a novel approach designed to both model narrative evolution and uncover the underlying mechanisms driving them. In this work we perform a comparative dis- course analysis across communities on Telegram covering the initial three months following the invasion. First, we uncover substantial disparities in narratives and perceptions between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian communities. Then, we probe deeper into prevalent narratives of each group, identifying key themes and examining the underlying mechanisms fuel- ing their evolution. Finally, we explore influences and factors that may shape the development and spread of narratives.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Operations within the Information Environment (OIE) rely crucially on the strategic deployment of information nar- ratives, as outlined in JP3-04, which describes them as a method to convey or interpret events in a manner that sup- ports a specific perspective or set of values (ibid. p. I-7). These narratives play a critical role in shaping how audi- ences perceive events, a challenge that has intensified with the advent of digital dissemination tools like generative AI (Goldstein et al. 2023) and social media platforms. The in- creasing accessibility and influence of these tools underscore the urgent need for advanced methods capable of effectively tracking and analyzing narratives. Such analysis is vital for unraveling the complexities of how narratives are crafted, evolve, and exert influence across the information landscape."}, {"title": "Related Work and Background", "content": "The exploration of narrative evolution within online com- munities, particularly in response to geopolitical events, has been addressed through various methodologies across the fields of computational social science. Prominent among these methodologies are clustering algorithms and topic modeling techniques, each offering unique insights but also exhibiting notable limitations in the context of dynamic nar- rative analysis."}, {"title": "Narrative Detection", "content": "The concept of 'narrative' has been a longstanding subject of study within the discipline of narratology (Smith 1980; Labov 2013); however, while the field generally agrees on the components of narratives, it still lacks a standard defini- tion. Previous studies posit \u201cnarrative frameworks\" as being comprised of stories which may align otherwise disparate domains of knowledge (Shahsavari et al. 2020). To build on this definition and follow the JP3-04, we adapt an informa- tion narrative framework detailed and used by similar recent works on narratives (Hanley, Kumar, and Durumeric 2023b), which utilize the logic of the Event Registry (Leban et al. 2014) idea where collections of documents seek to address the same event or issue (Miranda et al. 2018). Applying this logic, a narrative in our dataset might be \"There are Bio- logical Weapons Laboratories in Ukraine.\" This narrative encompasses various stories, each consisting of individual posts. For example, the text \"We confirm the facts that were revealed of the emergency cleansing by the Kiev regime of traces of the military-biological program\u201d would be part of the \"Cover-up and Destruction of Biological Weapon Devel- opment\" story, which in turn falls under the broader narra- tive about biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine."}, {"title": "Information Spread and Narrative Evolution", "content": "The dynamic nature of online information dissemination un- derscores the critical need for advanced analytical tools to capture the fluid evolution of narratives. Computational nar- rative analysis has emerged as a key approach, providing methodologies for dissecting and understanding the com- plex interplay between narrative structures and their prop- agation through digital platforms. Significant contributions, such as Chambers and Juraf- sky's work on narrative event chains, and McIntyre and La- pata's developments in narrative generation and machine learning, have established a strong foundation for under- standing narrative dynamics (Chambers and Jurafsky 2008; McIntyre and Lapata 2009). However, the rapid spread of online narratives often challenges traditional methods, leav- ing some complex aspects and internal dynamics of narrative evolution unaddressed."}, {"title": "Narrative Dynamics during RU-UA War", "content": "These challenges becomes particularly evident in the con- text of the Russian-Ukrainian war. The strategic deploy- ment of narratives, from claims of \"denazification\u201d to alle- gations of biological weapons labs, has significantly influ- enced public perception, both locally and globally (Jowett and O'Donnell 2018; Badawy, Ferrara, and Lerman 2019). The marked increase in narrative dissemination through var- ious media channels during this conflict highlights the need for more dynamic and adaptable tools in narrative analysis, capable of tracking the evolution of such narratives in real- time."}, {"title": "Clustering and Topic Modeling Limitations", "content": "While techniques like K-means, hierarchical clustering, La- tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and BERTopic have ad- vanced text grouping and theme identification, they strug- gle in the dynamic field of narrative analysis due to their need for predetermined cluster numbers (Blei, Ng, and Jor- dan 2003; Grootendorst 2020). This requirement limits flex- ibility and fails to adapt to the unpredictable emergence of narratives in response to real-world events (Aggarwal and Zhai 2012; Jain 2010; McInnes, Healy, and Astels 2017). Additionally, these methods offer only static snapshots, inadequate for monitoring evolving narratives that change with new information and shifts in discourse. Although DB- SCAN provides an alternative by not requiring preset clus- ter numbers, adapting it for real-time, streaming data envi- ronments remains a significant challenge. Its focus on data density may also misrepresent the complex structure of nar- ratives, hindering effective analysis in digital contexts. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for narrative detection and evolution that adjusts to new in- formation, identifies emerging narratives, and integrates do- main expertise for a deeper, more nuanced analysis."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This section outlines our method for dynamically clustering text data streams over time, designed to adapt to new con- tent. It aims to monitor the evolution of text clusters, aiding in identifying how narratives diverge or converge over time. This approach supports the organic discovery of narrative structures as they form, making it well-suited for analyz- ing the fluid information streams. An additional analytical layer can further enhance this model by integrating expert interpretation with clustering results, providing deeper nar- rative analysis. This component, while optional, merges sto- ries into cohesive narratives, enriching the algorithmic in- sights. While the primary model effectively manages tem- poral clustering, this integrated methodology is particularly aimed at revealing the complex dynamics within narratives."}, {"title": "Our Model \u2013 Clustering Streaming Text Data", "content": "The dynamic nature of analyzing evolving narratives de- mands a model that not only allows for the inherent inter- pretability of its processes but also facilitates the dynamic discovery of narrative structures. Hierarchical Agglomera- tive Clustering stands out as our method of choice, given its unique capacity to meet these requirements effectively."}, {"title": "Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) for Dy- namic Narrative Analysis", "content": "HAC is recognized for its adaptability in data analysis, particularly in forming clusters based on similarity without the need for pre-defined cluster numbers. This approach begins with each data point as a sep- arate cluster, iteratively merging the most similar pairs until a specified similarity threshold, such as cosine similarity, is met, ensuring homogeneity within clusters (M\u00fcllner 2011). Its inherent ability to uncover data structures naturally posi- tions HAC as a prime clustering candidate for extension for fluid narrative analysis, where the evolving nature of text-based data necessitates flexible and dynamic clustering tech- niques. Furthermore, HAC's iterative merging process is apt for online extensions, allowing new data to be integrated ef- ficiently in real-time. This adaptability ensures ongoing nar- rative analysis remains current, making HAC an exemplary foundation for methodologies aimed at exploring narrative evolution in dynamic environments."}, {"title": "Adapting HAC to Evolving Data Streams", "content": "To adapt HAC for real-time data analysis, we developed the OnlineAgglomerative class, which enhances HAC for dynamic environments. This class is detailed in our GitHub repository. Key to this adaptation is the incremental_fit() method, which dynamically clus- ters data and adjusts to new inputs by balancing im- mediate data integration with long-term cluster evalu- ation. Initially, clusters are formed using HAC. The incremental_fit() method then uses the class's clus- ter history to decide at each timestep whether to merge new data into existing clusters or initiate new clustering rounds, based on a predefined semantic similarity threshold. Additionally, incremental_fit() evaluates poten- tial cluster mergers with each data batch using Silhouette scores, which measure cluster cohesion and separation, and the pseudo-F index, assessing cluster quality. This approach not only ensures immediate data integration but also main- tains the structure and coherence of clusters over time. As a result, our approach enables effective real-time clustering by making immediate decisions and maintaining complex data structures as new information arrives, thereby helping to discover underlying data patterns in dynamic settings."}, {"title": "Exploiting Online Data Integration", "content": "Building on this foundation, the OnlineAgglomerative class then en- hances our ability to exploit streaming data integration ef- fectively. Through the incremental_fit () method, it tracks each cluster's centroid and size history, offering in- sights into cluster evolution. This tracking reveals patterns of development, merging, or separation, allowing us to de- code the evolving landscape of data and offering a window into the complex mechanisms that drive the data's evolution."}, {"title": "Advancing Our Model \u2013 Macro-Narratives", "content": "To enhance our model, we then introduce the MacroNarrative Class, an additional layer atop the OnlineAgglomerative curated clusters. This optional augmentation allows domain experts to weave together these clusters into a coherent narrative framework. We find this to be especially vital given the inherently fragmented landscape of narrative frameworks (further demonstrated in our data analysis), allowing for a synthe- sized, expert-informed view of the narrative's progression and thematic undercurrents."}, {"title": "Macro-Narrative Detection", "content": "After tracking story clusters using the OnlineAgglomerative class, we then use these as \"story clusters\" and employ the MacroNarrative class to infuse expert knowledge and examine how these story clusters form larger narrative clusters."}, {"title": "Step 1: Discovery and Refinement of Narrative Seeds", "content": "To begin our formation of narrative clusters, we start with a single story cluster uncovered in the previous step. This story cluster serves as the initial 'seed' from which we me- thodically unravel additional seeds, laying the groundwork for constructing a comprehensive narrative cluster."}, {"title": "Step 2: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Refinement", "content": "Upon identifying an initial potential seed cluster, our next step in- volves seeking additional seed clusters to guide the develop- ment and progression of a Narrative Cluster. This procedure harmonizes automated discovery with HITL refinement, en- gaging domain experts to ensure a balanced approach. Ini- tially, we employ a queue-based system for temporal eval- uation of the seed. At each timestep, story clusters falling within a predefined similarity threshold-typically between 0.7 and 0.8 cosine similarity, as determined effective for our narratives are queued for further analysis and simultane- ously earmarked for human review. This method, reminis- cent of a breadth-first search (BFS), ensures a comprehen- sive and robust selection of potential seeds for additional refinement by analysts. These analysts then evaluate a rep- resentative sample, chosen randomly (in our scenario, 20 points from each cluster), at every timestep. The analysts then save clusters that retain ongoing relevance and align- ment with the intended narrative direction. These are used as the \"seed clusters\" whose positions in the embedding space will guide the resulting Narrative Cluster throughout time."}, {"title": "Step 3: Narrative Centroid Construction", "content": "Expanding from the curated seed clusters, the MacroCluster class constructs a 'Narrative Centroid' that dynamically navigates through time alongside its seed clusters. This evolving cen- troid adjusts in real-time to the development of seed story clusters, enabling the narrative cluster to reflect the narra- tive's fluidity over time. By applying similarity thresholds, the MacroCluster class then integrates other story clus- ters into the narrative at various points in time, offering an adaptive perspective on narrative evolution. An example of this adaptive narrative tracking is our anal- ysis of information narratives during the Bucha Massacre in 2022. In examining the Bucha Massacre narratives within the Ukrainian community, we observed the interplay of var- ious story clusters pertaining to the liberation of Bucha within the narrative cluster. While these clusters were ini- tially identified as during the automated discovery stage, their generalized focus on liberation precluded them from being considered as grounding seeds. However, during the appropriate time period (i.e., when they were discussing the liberation of Bucha), their interactions with the established narrative were still captured and analyzed through the narra- tive centroid's adaptive framework, demonstrating the abil- ity to reflect both the stability and fluidity of narrative ele- ments within a broader context."}, {"title": "Data Analysis: Russo-Ukrainian War", "content": "Applying our OnlineAgglomerative and MacroNarrative classes, we then delve into the narratives emerging from the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Overall, there are 989 channels represented with over 9.67 million total posts, written mostly in Ukrainian and Russian. We sampled this data to focus our analysis on the first three months of the war (from February 20, 2022 through May 28, 2022), in which we track 568 channels (comprising dis- tinct \u201cRussian-leaning\u201d and \u201cUkrainian-leaning\u201d communi- ties) and approximately 2 million posts."}, {"title": "Telegram Platform", "content": "Telegram, a messaging app that facil- itates both user interactions in private and public groups and one-way broadcasts via channels, is seen as a bastion of a \"free\" Internet in Russia, evading bans that affect other plat- forms like Facebook and TikTok since 2020 .

Next, following the findings of previous work (Hanley and Durumeric 2023), we remove any posts that have fewer than four words.

To ensure the validity of the evolving clusters, we must monitor that each cluster (1) is cohesive within a timestep and these results are (2) consistent across timesteps. To do this, we ran our incremental fitting process across 15 weeks, each week comprising an average of 120 thousand mes- sages. We find that each point had an average cosine sim- ilarity of 0.935 with its respective cluster centroid on any given timestep - which is above our set similarity thresh- old and indicating cohesion \u2013 and an average cosine similar- ity of 0.245 with remaining clusters. Furthermore, we find that these similarity results are consistent across timesteps (i.e., it does not degrade as our algorithm considers more timesteps), suggesting that the algorithm effectively encom- passes new data, correctly discerning when to fold data into existing clusters (and adjust the characteristics of these clus- ters) or create new clusters."}, {"title": "Trending Story Discovery", "content": "Following the OnlineAgglomerative clustering, our method- ology includes a key process for identifying emerg- ing trends within story clusters, utilizing the analyze micro_cluster_trends() function, included in our code repository. This approach evaluates the expansion or reduction of story clusters at each timestep by tracking the change in data volume compared to the preceding period. More than just pinpointing the largest clusters at any given time (which often reflected persistent themes rather than trending topics) our strategy focuses on identifying fluctuations that signal shifting interests or concerns within the community; this method proved particularly effective in highlighting stories gaining traction and capturing the community's engagement with unfolding events. These insights revealed not only what topics are cur- rently engaging the community but also serve as indicators for potential overarching narratives, laying the groundwork for deeper narrative analysis."}, {"title": "Trending Story Validation", "content": "Our analysis focused on the 5 top-trending clusters each week, revealing that approxi- mately 93.2% of the time, these clusters directly matched significant, unfolding external events documented in the ac- companying documentation with this paper to ensure re- producibility.

To validate our narrative clusters, we cross-referenced the emerging and predetermined narratives against external sources and expert opinions. This process ensured that the clusters accurately reflected the evolving discourse within the targeted communities."}, {"title": "Additional LLM-Driven Validation", "content": "Following our story and narrative clustering and monitoring of narrative macro- clusters, we sought to understand what themes emerge and how themes evolve within narratives.

The process begins by generating 15 theme dictionaries through analyzing story clusters within the similarity thresholds of narrative centroids. We initial- ize an empty map to track the emergence of each theme. The Llama2 model, supplied with data points closest to each cluster's centroid and any previously generated themes, identifies new themes or refines existing ones. Each theme and its emergence timestep are recorded in this map. The process is thoroughly documented in our repository. We then evaluate each theme dictionary using a clas- sification model to calculate a Theme Coverage Score (TCS), which measures the percentage of texts exceeding a set threshold for at least one theme, summed across all timesteps. A higher TCS indicates better theme recognition, suggesting a more comprehensive and representative set of themes. After comparing TCS values, we select the dictio- nary with the highest score, ensuring our narrative analysis is accurate and representative. While TCS scores are gen- erally consistent, variations occur mainly in the number of themes and their phrasing. The validation of the classifica- tion model's scoring mechanism was conducted both prior to and during the theme extraction processes."}, {"title": "Narrative Theme Classification", "content": "In the final step, we use the final collection of extracted themes and applied the clas- sification model to assign thematic labels to each message within the narrative.

Text must exceed this threshold (0-1) to be assigned a specific theme. We determine this threshold by initially running our theme extraction model, then manu- ally examining how the classification model labels 200 texts at varying thresholds. Prioritizing specificity to minimize noise, we choose a threshold that optimizes accuracy. We note that theme trends stay consistent across various thresh- olds, reinforcing our confidence in our method's reliability."}, {"title": "Results and Key Findings", "content": "We apply and validate our novel narrative detection and evo- lution pipeline to the Russian and Ukrainian communities.

To get a sense of this disparity, we have a human annotator label the top 10 trending stories from either community for each week as \u201cMilitary/War,\u201d \u201cPolitics - Internal,\u201d or \u201cPoli- tics-, International;\" the results are shown in Table 1.\""}, {"title": "Narrative Analysis", "content": "We conduct an in-depth analysis of four major narratives from each community (shown in Tables 4 and 5) evaluat- ing the narratives at both the story and the theme levels; we examine their persistence, the micro-narratives they encom- pass, their summaries, and the key authors involved."}, {"title": "Narrative Stories Vary across Communities", "content": "First, we find that the number of story clusters comprising each nar- rative is narrative-specific. For example, the Russian narra- tive about denazifying Ukraine contained many more story (micro-narrative) clusters (7-10 depending on the timestep) than the Ukrainian narrative about Ukraine belonging in the European Union (4-7 depending on the timestep). Addition- ally, we find that the number of comprising stories can shift across timesteps and in response to external events. For ex- ample, following Russian accusations of biological weapons at the United Nations, the Russian narrative about bio-weapon labs swelled with new stories of new-found \"doc- uments\" proving the existence of \u201cbiolaboratories\u201d created and financed by the United States in Ukraine, where experi- ments were conducted with samples of bat coronavirus.\""}, {"title": "Narrative Themes Persist Across Stories", "content": "Moreover, we find that the stories within narratives are typically charac- terized by 1-3 closely related themes, reinforcing the con- cept of these clusters as the foundational elements of narra- tives. The prevalence of multiple themes seems to stem from the interconnectedness of these themes. For instance, within the denazification narrative, messages containing the theme \"Ukrainian leaders depicted as Nazi sympathizers\" were sig- nificantly more likely to have the theme \u201cUkrainian nation- alism linked with neo-Nazism\" (with a Spearman correla- tion coefficient of 0.83 with a p-value < 0.01). These types of correlations between similar themes were found in mul- tiple narratives and, when coupled with the lack of correla- tions found among more disparate themes, appear to support the notion that narratives may act as frameworks which may align otherwise disparate domains of knowledge."}, {"title": "Narrative Focuses May Correlate with Key Contributors", "content": "We then explore associations between contributors' posting patterns and subsequent narrative shifts in online commu- nities. Our analysis begins with Granger causality tests to identify whether the timing of an author's posts can forecast changes in engagement with the narrative. We ensure that the author's own posts are excluded from later analyses to prevent bias. This analysis highlights statistically significant predictive relationships (p-value < 0.01), but it is important to note that these do not confirm causal relationships. To further examine these relationships, we use Spear- man's rank correlation coefficient, appropriate for assessing non-linear associations. Results are detailed in Tables 2 and 3, focusing on correlations that exceed a threshold of 0.3 and are significant at a p-value of less than 0.01. We find that the most notable associations for overall narrative shifts typi- cally occur with a one-day lag, illustrating the rapid influ- ence of specific contributions. However, the timing of peak associations varies more in the context of thematic engage- ment, with some authors demonstrating significant correla- tions several days later. Interestingly, those with high the- matic correlations are not always among the most prolific posters, suggesting a complex interplay in how narratives evolve within the community."}, {"title": "Narratives Adapt in Quantity and Makeup", "content": "Narratives appear to adapt to external influences, showing changes in both post volume and thematic content. This adaptation is evident in how narratives respond to events, incorporating both the frequency of posts and their evolving themes. The Bucha Massacre serves as a distinct example of this phenomenon. The Ukrainian community's narrative was characterized by active reporting on the event, focusing on civilian harm and military defense, as shown in the increase of posts during this time. Conversely, the Russian commu- nity initially minimized discussion, later shifting to claims of \"provocation\" and misinformation as the event gained inter- national attention. This divergence in response and strategy between communities is starkly illustrated in the aftermath of Bucha, emphasizing the narratives' dynamic nature. The evolution of narrative themes further demonstrates their responsiveness. Initially, Russia's narrative centered on \"denazification,\u201d highlighting issues like language sup- pression and cultural genocide, as referenced in early state- ments. However, as the conflict progressed, the narrative pivoted to patriotic themes, celebrating Russia's actions against perceived Nazism, as depicted in Figure 2.

This emphasis on documenta- tion persists and intensifies over time, becoming crucial to counter the Russian narrative's accusations of fabrication and misinformation (this general shift from on-the-ground coverage to documentation is further illustrated in Figure 4). Additionally, this framework of understanding becomes a lens through which the Ukrainian community views and discusses other similar incidents, increasingly comparing other events to the massacre with statements like \"the second Bucha is now taking place in the Kherson region,\" indicating a broader application of the Bucha narrative to comprehend subsequent events. Contrastingly, the Russian narrative on the Bucha Massacre, emerging predominantly post-Western media coverage, consistently features claims of propaganda and Ukrainian provocation. This emphasis on efforts to \u201cex- pose the fake about Bucha\" and challenge the \u201cdemonization of Russia\" by Western media intertwines with a persistent theme of Russian victimhood, which we note across other narratives discussion by Russian communities."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our deeper exploration into the narratives discussed by Rus- sian and Ukrainian communities on Telegram during the early stages of the war sheds light on the dynamic and con- trasting ways these groups perceive and respond to unfold- ing events.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and precise medical diagnosis. Significant efforts have been made in clinical DECT to acquire temporally consistent data sets at two different tube potentials leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies [1]. As these high-end DECT systems may be limited to major clinical centers or research institutes, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. In sequentially-scanning DECT, data sets corresponding to two different tube potentials are acquired at two different time points. Since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, as demonstrated by Fig. 1, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration.\nTo address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT, in this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short. ACCELERATION first reconstructs several time-resolved images, each corresponding to an improved temporal resolution, using the short-scan"}, {"title": "2. THE PROPOSED ACCELERATION TECHNIQUE", "content": "Our goal is to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. As shown in Fig. 1, suppose that scanning at the first tube potential is performed during [0, T2], the tube potential is changed during [T2, T3], and scanning at the second tube potential is performed during [T3, T5]. The variation of iodine concentration in imaged subjects underwent intravenous contrast injection at each image voxel can be approximately considered as general Gamma-Variate functions [2]. Given the short duration of data acquisition (e.g. about 0.2 seconds to acquire a short-scan data set using a state-of-the-art CT scanner), the variation of iodine concentration within this short duration can be legitimately assumed as linear.\nThe input of ACCELERATION is the short-scan sinograms at different tube potentials acquired during [0, T2] and [T3, T5], and its output is the reconstructed CT images at the same time (referred to as T4 in this paper) at two tube potentials and its decomposed water basis and iodine basis images."}, {"title": "2.1. Reconstruction by solving Eq. (1)", "content": "In implicit neural representation learning [3], a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Mo is trained to express the mapping relationship between pixel coordinates and pixel values.

(2) to train in sequence in the image domain and sinogram domain to obtain accurate CT reconstruction images (see in Fig. 4). The image obtained by FBP is used to obtain the MLP parameter 01 using Eq. (1). Then, the sinogram and 01 are used to obtain 02 using Eq. (2) (which can be regarded as fine-tuning of 01)."}, {"title": "2.4. ACCELERATION", "content": "Based on the three parts introduced above, we developed ACCELERATION technique to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT.\nAt the first tube potential (see in pale blue section in Fig. 5), in the first step, short-scan data is input into Short-scan image reconstruction module (see in 4) for reconstruction, obtaining the image and its corresponding MLP parameter 00 at time T\u2081 (see in Fig. 1). In the second step, sorting limited-angle data. The optimization objective can be written as follows:\n$\\theta_t^* = \\text{argmin}_{\\theta_t} \\frac{1}{|S_t|} \\sum_{i \\in S_t} (\\sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} M_{\\theta_t}(X_j) - S_i)^2,$\n$S_t = \\{\\frac{M}{T} (t-1)+1, \\frac{M}{T} (t-1)+2,..., \\frac{M}{T} t \\},$\nwhere Ot denotes the MLP parameters corresponding to the t-th time frame, t = 1,2,\u2026, T. St denotes the set of measurement corresponding to the t-th time frame, |\u00b7| denotes the number of elements in the set, and T denotes the number of reconstructed time frames which is a hyper-parameter to be optimized for the best reconstruction accuracy.\nAccording to the physical process of CT data acquisition, the T segments have a linear temporal sequence, thus the CT images obtained by different segments also have the temporal sequence (uniformly distributed in [0, T2]). In the third step, based on the T CT images obtained in the previous step, for each pixel in the CT, a linear least squares fitting is used, and then extrapolated to time T4 to predict the CT image at time T4 at first tube potential (see in pale orange section in Fig. 5). The scan data at the second tube potential only needs to perform the same first step as the first tube potential (see in lavender section in Fig. 5) at T4.\nAfter the above operations, the temporal inconsistency in sequentially-scanning DECT is mitigated, and we can obtain CT images at time T4 at different tube potentials, and then perform material decomposition to obtain accurate material basis images."}, {"title": "3. MATERIALS", "content": "Material basis images (water-iodine basis pair) of a human subject who underwent the dual-energy contrast-enhanced cerebral CT angiographic imaging were used in the simulation. The iodine concentration increases by 0.5 times of the original value within a short scan(see [0, T2], [T3, T5] in Fig. 1). The time taken to change the tube potential is the same as the time taken for a short scan. Therefore, the iodine concentration changes to 2.5 times the collected data in the interval [0, T5]. Assuming a short-scan contains 1000 views, the iodine concentration at each view time within [0, T5] can be interpolated based on the linear variation of the iodine concentration. The CT images at different tube potentials at different times can be calculated based on the water concentration and iodine concentration at corresponding times. By performing a forward projection at corresponding view on each simulated CT image, we can simulate the sinograms of the two short scans [0, T2] and [T3, T3]. Based on these sinograms, we can proceed with the reconstruction and material decomposition, and the simulated CT images can then be used for validation."}, {"title": "4.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION", "content": "In this work, it has been demonstrated that using ACCELERATION, the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets can be mitigated. Results shown in this work demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION. In future, we plan to incorporate a broader range of ablation studies to investigate the performance dependence of ACCELLERATION. Additionally, we aim to demonstrate the technical feasibility of ACCELLERATION using experimental animal subject studies. It is important to note that the ground truth of iodine concentration of experimental animal subjects who underwent dual-energy contrast-enhanced imaging is very difficult to obtain. More efforts are needed to establish proper references of iodine concentration to consolidate experimental validation using animal subjects."}]}

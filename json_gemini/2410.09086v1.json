Introduction", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1. Artificial Intelligence", "content": "The landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed notable transformations in both its conceptualization and practical applications in recent years. Originating in the mid-20th century with a focus on rule-based systems emulating human intelligence, the contemporary definition of AI has undergone a paradigm shift. In 2007, Stanford professor John McCarthy succinctly defined AI as \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.\" Fast forward to 2021, the goal of AI has developed into a machine that can think like humans and mimic human behaviors, including perceiving, reasoning, learning, planning, predicting, and so on (Xu et al., 2021). The current emphasis is on machines' capability to learn and adapt from data, a transformation largely attributed to the ascendancy of machine learning methodologies. In recent years, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has gained prominence, empowering computers to process and understand vast amounts of complex data. The development of neural networks, particularly those with multiple layers, has revolutionized Al capabilities, enabling significant strides in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and strategic game theory. Furthermore, the integration of Al across diverse sectors, ranging from healthcare to finance and autonomous vehicles, highlights the practicality and versatility of these intelligent systems in addressing real-world challenges. However, as Al continues to advance, concerns surrounding ethical considerations, transparency, and the broader societal implications of these technologies persist, adding depth to the ongoing discourse within the field."}, {"title": "1.2.

Systematic Review Approach", "content": "A systematic review is a meticulous approach to examining scientific publications. It involves conducting a thorough search for relevant research, assessing their quality, and synthesizing the findings of these studies using predetermined criteria. This technique is intended to reduce bias while providing a trustworthy summary of the evidence on a specific research subject. Systematic reviews are significant because they collect data from numerous sources, providing a more comprehensive knowledge of study findings than individual studies. By critically appraising and synthesizing existing research, systematic reviews can provide clarity on conflicting results and guide practitioners in making evidence-based decisions. Furthermore, they play an important role in identifying research gaps and creating goals for future studies.Our systematic review is segmented into three principal modules: Planning, Preparation, and Analysis. Each module serves a distinct purpose and will be described in detail below."}, {"title": "3.1.

Privacy", "content": "Nine papers explored the subtheme of privacy. Three of the nine papers provide professional perspectives on this subtheme. Cushing & Osti's (2022) paper detailing the results of focus groups about the opinions of archivists on AI states that there is a lack of trust in AI systems to redact sensitive information accurately. Similarly, Li & Fleischmann's (2020) research, which explores the perspectives of ALA-accredited master's program students, found that many were concerned about the ethical challenges AI may pose to patron privacy. Conversely, Modiba's (2023) study on user perception of the use of AI for records management found that users think AI can facilitate adequate security of records. Three papers by Jaillant (2022a, 2022b) and one by Rees (2022), identify privacy restrictions as a major barrier to the access of born-digital and digitized records. In all three papers, using Al to identify sensitive information is proposed as a solution. Schneider et al.

Discussion", "content": "RQ1- Section 4 of the paper addresses Research Question 1 (RQ1) by detailing how archivists and records management professionals have employed various AI techniques. The predominant methods are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), which are particularly suited for managing the extensive textual and visual data found in both paper archives and electronic records. Although many studies focus on automating processes through AI techniques, practicality remains a significant topic of debate. Our review found that 60% of the papers utilized pre-trained models for specific tasks. While these models are currently state-of-the-art, their memory footprint continues to hamper real-world applications. We believe that more work should be done to address inference issues rather than only concentrating on achieving high accuracy.\nRQ2- As detailed in Section 5, AI has been applied to most records management and archives functions. Within records management, the most common function being performed by AI is classification. Considering that classification is the organization of records into categories according to a plan or scheme (InterPARES Trust, 2023), this function can be easily carried out by AI, explaining the predominance of literature on the subject. It does not seem, however, that AI has been used to carry out functional analysis, the identification of the activities of an organization on which a classification schema is based. Within archives, AI has been fairly evenly applied to both appraisal and arrangement and description functions, with five and six papers on the subjects, respectively. Most of the literature, though, addresses the access and use of records, a function that occurs in both records management and archives. The use of AI for searching and retrieving records is by far the most prevalent use, with seventeen papers on the subject. Consequently, this suggests that, to date, the accessibility of records has been one of the primary problems addressed by AI. However, the focus on paper archives has been less frequent compared to digitized records (fourteen papers to twenty-two). This imbalance might be attributed to the predominance of digital records within records management environments.\nRQ3- As we have seen through the course of this study, many archives and records management functions can be performed by AI. By using AI to carry out menial, time-consuming tasks, archivists and other information professionals could use the excess time to address other creative and cognitively complex work, resulting in more records, both physical and digital, becoming available for access. There are also areas of archival work that AI has yet to be applied to or is just beginning to be applied to. For example, AI could detect outdated and offensive language in pre-existing catalogs that need to be changed or addressed in some way, or it could be used to flag quality control issues in the digitization process for audiovisual materials. Of course, generative AI will also provide information professionals with new challenges in how to best apply the technology, how to best acknowledge when and where it has been used, and how to manage AI-generated material in their repositories, particularly with the challenges it poses to traditional archival principles like creatorship. Regardless, AI has the potential to be an essential tool for dealing with the massive amount of digital records being created every day."}, {"title": "7. Conclusion and Future Directions", "content": "Not many studies have explored the role of AI in keeping digital records safe and readable over time. A key question is whether AI can help by automatically turning old or hard-to-read records into formats that are easy for everyone to use.

Understanding this better could help us improve how archives operate in the future", "types": "the first focuses on how archives work, and the other dives deep theoretically into the AI side. The first category might not completely focus on how Al works, while the second is all about the AI model details without explaining how it fits into real-world archival work.

However, the 10 electrodes placed on the surface would\ncause a lot of inconvenience and discomfort, while the rapidly advancing wearable devices adopt the\nreduced-lead or single-lead ECG to reduce discomfort as a solution in long-term monitoring. Since the\nsingle-lead ECG is a subset of 12-lead ECG, it provides insufficient cardiac health information and\nplays a substandard role in real-world healthcare applications. Hence, it is necessary to utilize signal\ngeneration technologies to reduce their clinical importance gap by reconstructing 12-lead ECG from the\nreal single-lead ECG. Specifically, this study proposes a multi-channel masked autoencoder (MCMA)\nfor this goal. In the experimental results, the visualized results between the generated and real signals\ncan demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. At the same time, this study introduces\na comprehensive evaluation benchmark named ECGGenEval, encompassing the signal-level, feature-\nlevel, and diagnostic-level evaluations, providing a holistic assessment of 12-lead ECG signals and\ngenerative model. Further, the quantitative experimental results are as follows, the mean square\nerrors of 0.0178 and 0.0658, correlation coefficients of 0.7698 and 0.7237 in the signal-level evaluation,\nthe average Fl-score with two generated 12-lead ECG is 0.8319 and 0.7824 in the diagnostic-level\nevaluation, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

Moreover, the prevalence rate continues to\nshow an upward trend in the developing areas in\nthe past decades[3], posing a great challenge for\nresearchers and cardiologists to address. In clinical\npractice, clinicians need to adopt some character-\nization tools[4] to diagnose cardiovascular disease,\nand one of the most popular tools is the standard\n12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). With the great\ndevelopment in deep learning, some researchers\nhave trained a cardiologist-level model with the\n12-lead ECG, like Ribeiro et al[5]. In conclusion,\nthe 12-lead ECG could provide comprehensive car-\ndiac information from various views for doctors\nand classification models, playing an essential role\nin cardiac healthcare.\nHowever, the 12-lead ECG signal collection\nprocess will put at least 10 electrodes on the user's\nsurface, which would cause a lot of inconvenience\nand discomfort for users, and make long-term\ncardiac health monitoring difficult. Up to now,\nthe standard 12-lead ECG is traditionally used\nin the hospital for short-term diagnosis, lasting\nabout 1 minute, while the cardiac abnormality\nwill need long-term monitoring[6] to capture the\nparoxysmal event. As a consequence, researchers\nand markets are trying their best to explore some\nuser-friendly devices for ECG signals collecting\nin the real-world application, including patch[6-\n8], smartwatch[9-11], and armband[12-14]. These\nwearable devices can be used to obtain single-\nlead ECG from the surface, effectively improving\nthe users' usage comfort. However, in comparison\nwith the standard 12-lead ECG, the ambula-\ntory signals could not provide sufficient cardiac\nhealth-related information, since it only observes\nthe heart's electrical activity from some limited\nangles. Although the single-lead ECG can be used\nfor cardiac abnormality classification, like the lead\nI for the Atrial Fibrillation [15], the lead V1 for\nthe Brugada Syndrome [16], and the lead aVR\nfor the Sinus Bradycardia [17], the full 12-lead\nECG is necessary to provide comprehensive infor-\nmation, matching the knowledge and needs of\nclinical physicians, a limited or reduced number\nof leads ECG from wearable devices will not work\neffectively for doctors.\nBased on the mentioned above, it is of\ngreat importance to strike a harmonious balance\nbetween clinical effectiveness and application fea-\nsibility. On the one hand, the clinical standard 12-\nlead electrocardiogram to comprehensively mea-\nsure heart health[5]. However, it is challenging to\ncollect the standard 12-lead ECG to complete var-\nious health-related tasks, since it will cause some-\nwhat inconvenience and discomfort with these\nsurface electrodes. On the other hand, wearable\ndevices have been a popular choice for users, but\nthey can only collect reduced-lead or single-lead\nECG, largely limiting their clinical importance.\nThen, many researchers try to reduce the gap\nbetween the reduced-lead and 12-lead ECG, like\nthe challenge proposed by Reyna et al [18]. The\nchallenge asks to access the diagnostic potential of\nthe reduced-lead ECG, including 6-lead, 4-lead, 3-\nlead, and 2-lead ECG, which would be compared\nwith the 12-lead ECG. Nejedly et al[19] adopt the\nensemble learning, residual network, and attention\nmechanism to finish this task, and they success-\nfully achieve state-of-the-art performance in this\nchallenge. To this end, some similar researches[20-\n23] propose various deep learning technologies\ninto the varied-lead ECG signals. It is effective\nfrom the arrhythmia classification task, but these\nmentioned studies only focus on the classification\nperformance, only providing an indirect approach\nto reduce the gap between the reduced-lead and\n12-lead ECG.\nConsequently, to overcome these limitations, it\nis necessary to provide a direct approach to reduce\nthe gap between the reduce-lead (Specifically,\nsingle-lead) and 12-lead ECG, that is, reconstruct-\ning 12-lead ECG with the reduced-lead ECG[24-\n33], as seen in Fig.1. Although these methods can\napproximately reconstruct 12-lead ECG with the\nlimited-lead ECG, there is a research gap to fill for\nthis 12-lead ECG reconstruction task. Firstly, the\ntraditional generative models usually focus on the\nfixed single-lead, and it is difficult to reconstruct\n12-lead ECG with arbitrary single-lead ECG. Sec-\nondly, the related works [27-33] mainly focus on\nsignal-level evaluation, instead of comprehensive\nevaluation for this task, and it is known the signal-\nlevel evaluation result will be influenced by various\nnoises. Therefore, the contributions in this study\nare as follows:\n\u2022 A novel 12-lead ECG reconstruction framework,\nMCMA, is proposed in this study, and it can\nconvert arbitrary single-lead ECG into a 12-lead\nECG.\n\u2022 A benchmark for 12-lead ECG reconstruc-\ntion tasks is proposed, ECGGenEval, including\nsignal-level, feature-level, and diagnostic-level.\n\u2022 The proposed framework can achieve state-\nof-the-art reconstruction performance in the\ninternal and external test sets, with a mean\nsquare error of 0.0178 and a Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of 0.7698.\nThe following contents will clearly present the\nstudy subjects, the proposed methods and the\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmark for valida-\ntion, the experimental results and discussion, and\nthe drawn conclusions."}, {"title": "2 Study Subjects", "content": "The standard 12-lead ECG is one of the most\npopular schemes in clinical practice, which could\nprovide enough cardiac health information. As\nmentioned, it is difficult to collect the long-term\n12-lead ECG, since it causes a lot of inconve-\nnience. This section will present the definition of\n12-lead ECG, including time-domain and space-\ndomain definitions. Firstly, a normal ECG should\ninclude P-wave, QRS-complex, and T-wave, rep-\nresenting the corresponding cardiac activity. For\nexample, the P-wave means the atrial depolariza-\ntion, if the abnormal atrial depolarization process\nexists, there is a change in P-wave-based ECG.\nSecondly, the 12-lead ECG needs 10 electrodes\non the surface, and each electrode position in the\n12-lead ECG is seen in Table 1."}, {"title": "3 Data Source", "content": "To reconstruct the 12-lead ECG with single-lead\nECG in the clinical practice, this study conducts\na large-scale 12-lead ECG datasets, consisting of\n28,833 recordings from three public 12-lead ECG\ndatasets, i.e., PTB-XL[45, 46], CPSC2018[35], and\nCODE-test[5]. The proposed framework will be\ntrained and validated with PTB-XL initially, and\nusing two external datasets to further prove its\nfeasibility.\n3.1 \u0420\u0422\u0412-XL\nIn this study, PTB-XL [45, 46] will be used for\nmodel training, validating, and testing. As a\nlarge dataset, PTB-XL involves 21,799 clinical 10-\nsecond 12-lead ECG signals, and the sampling\nfrequency is 500Hz. Based on the clinical standard,\nthis dataset includes 71 kinds of ECG statements.\nAs recommended, this study will adopt the cross-\nvalidation folds, in which the folds from the 1st\nfold to the 8th fold will be the training set, the\n9th fold and the 10th fold act as the validation\nset and testing set, respectively. The ratio for\ntraining:validation: and testing is about 8:1:1.\n3.2 CPSC2018\nTo demonstrate the advantages and feasibility,\nCPSC2018[35] is used as an external testing set\nsince the data distribution and information do not\nappear in model training and choosing. CPSC2018\ncontains 6,877 12-lead ECG, and these lengths\nvaried from 6 seconds to 60 seconds with 500 Hz in\nsampling frequency. This dataset mainly includes\na 9-type ECG, which aims to find out the cardiac\narrhythmia detection tool.\n3.3 CODE-test\nThe above datasets just focus on similarity eval-\nuation for the generated signals. This study will\nestablish a benchmark for 12-lead ECG recon-\nstruction. Therefore, this process requires repre-\nsentative research for 12-lead ECG classification,\nlike Ribeiro et al [5]. This testing set is named\nCODE-test, including 827 12-lead ECG collected\nfrom different patients.\n3.4 Data Distribution\nSince the generative model requires the 1024 point\nas input length, then the data distribution for two\nlarge-scale datasets could be listed as Table 2."}, {"title": "4 Method", "content": "This section will introduce the details of the\nproposed framework, model architecture, ECG\ndataset, and evaluation metric.\n4.1 \u041c\u0421\u041c\u0410 Input & Output\nThe proposed framework will be named as Multi-Channel Masked Autoencoder (MCMA), which\ncould mask different 11 leads and remain only\na single-lead ECG to generate the entire 12-lead\nECG. The input of MCMA is single-lead ECG,\nwhile the output of MCMA is 12-lead ECG. The\nsignal length is 1024 for MCMA. In this study,\nno preprocessing step is used to avoid influencing\nECG signals, like filtering or scaling.\n4.2 Multi-Channel Configuration\nIn this study, MCMA, the proposed framework,\nneeds to convert arbitrary single-lead ECG into\nthe standard 12-lead ECG, and the multi-channel\nconfiguration will be used to reduce training and\ninference costs. On the one hand, with the multi-\nchannel configuration, only one model is necessary\nto reconstruct 12-lead ECG from arbitrary single-\nlead ECG, distinguished from related works, like\ngarg et al[30] focus on utilizing lead II to recon-\nstruct 12-lead ECG, making it difficult for their\nmodel to work with other single-lead ECG as\ninput. On the other hand, unlike Electrocardio\npanorama [39], the input ECG is one of the stan-\ndard 12-lead ECG, and the output is the stan-\ndard 12-lead ECG. Therefore, the input shape for\nMCMA is (1024\u00d712), which could adapt different\nsingle-lead ECG as input.\n4.3 Model Architecture\nFor this framework, it is necessary to design a\nproper model for 12-lead reconstruction, aiming\nto learn the effective representation. Firstly, it\nis necessary to take into account the locality\nand uncertainty of features within the ECG sig-\nnals and there is no feature alignment in signal\npreprocessing. Therefore, the convolutional neu-\nral network can largely extract the local feature,\nwhich can play a key module in this 12-lead\nECG reconstruction task. The designed model in\nMCMA is shown in Fig.2."}, {"title": "4.4 Training MCMA", "content": "4.4.1 Padding Strategy\nSince the proposed framework will be used to\nreconstruct 12-lead ECG with arbitrary single-\nlead ECG, and it is necessary to adopt a channel\npadding strategy in this study. To retain the space\ninformation for each single-lead ECG, the zero-\npadding strategy is proposed in this study. When\nthe single-channel ECG will be processed into the\n12-channel format, while the other channels will\nbe set as zeros, as seen in Eq.1.\n$P(ecg_{12}, i) = I_z \\times ecg_{12}[i]$\t\t(1)\nIn Eq.1, the shape of index matrix for zero-\npadding is 12 \u00d7 1, $I_z(i) = 1$ with other elements\nbeing zeros. Specifically, the output shape equals\nthe input shape, and the shape of $ecg_{12}$ is 12 \u00d7 N,\nthen the shape of $ecg_{12}[i]$ is 1 \u00d7 N, so the out-\nput shape also is 12 \u00d7 N. With zero-padding,\nMCMA could adaptively solve different inputs.\nTo highlight its advantages, the 12 copies for the\nsingle-lead ECG will be as a comparison, named\nas the copy-padding strategy. The index matrix\nfor copy-padding strategy, $I_c$, all elements are 1.\nAt the same time, the arbitrary input lead and the\nfixed lead (lead I) will be compared. In addition,\nthe 12-lead ECG is provided in model training,\nand the padding strategy aims to mask the orig-\ninal 11-lead ECG with zeros or the remaining\nsingle-lead ECG in the standard 12-lead ECG.\nMeanwhile, only the single-lead ECG exists in the\nreal-world application process, it should be with\nthe padding strategy for the proposed framework.\n4.4.2 Loss Function\nThe generative models mainly involve\nautoencoder(AE) [42], generative adversarial\nnetwork(GAN)[38], diffusion model[43]. Although\nthe diffusion model has shown its great poten-\ntial and ability in various tasks, the sampling\nspeed [44] is challenging.

Thirdly, the trained autoencoder\ncould generate the reconstucted 12-lead ECG,\nwhich could be used to evaluation or downstream\ntasks. Then, the application process for MCMA\ncould be seen in Eq.3.\n$g_{ecg} = AE(I_z \\times ecg_1)$\t(3)\nIn Eq.3, $g_{ecg}$ is the generated 12-lead ECG\nwith MCMA, $ecg_1$ is the single-lead ECG collected\nby wearable devices, $I_z$ could convert $ecg_1$ into the\ninput of AE."}, {"title": "4.6 Comprehensive Evaluations", "content": "As mentioned, to fill the evaluation gap in\nthis research field, this study will introduce a\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmark, named as\nECGGenEval. Specifically, this benchmark will\ncontain 3 kinds of evaluation metrics, that is,\nsignal-level, feature-level and diagnostic-level. The\nfollowing contents will introduce the detailed eval-\nuation metrics respectively.\n4.6.1 Signal-Level\nThis study adopt the Pearson correlation coeffi-\ncient (PCC) and mean square error (MSE) in the\nsignal-level evaluation. It is necessary to define the\nreal and generated ECG signal as $r_{ecg}$ and $g_{ecg}$.\nThen, the definitions for PCC and MSE are shown\nin Eq.4 and Eq.5.\n$PCC(r_{ecg}, g_{ecg}) = \\frac{\\mu(r_{ecg} \\times g_{ecg}) \u2013 \\mu(r_{ecg})\\mu(g_{ecg})}{\\sigma(r_{ecg})\\sigma(g_{ecg})}$\t(4)\n$MSE(r_{ecg}, g_{ecg}) = \\langle (r_{ecg} \u2013 g_{ecg})^2 \\rangle$\t(5)\nIn these equations, as Eq.4 and Eq.5, $\\mu(*)$\nand $\\sigma(*)$ denotes the mean value and standard\ndeviation, respectively. The PCC varies from\n-1 to 1, and the MSE is at least bigger than\n0. The relationship between MSE and genera-\ntion performance is positively related, while the\nrelationship between MSE and generation per-\nformance is negatively related. Therefore, based\non the signal-level evaluation, a better generative\nmodel should be with a higher PCC and lower\nMSE from two different aspects.\n4.6.2 Feature-Level\nAlthough the signal-level evaluation is established,\nsince the original ECG signals may be subject to\nvarying degrees of influence from ambient noise,\nsome metrics in other levels are needed for objec-\ntively evaluating the reconstruction performance.\nThis section will introduce the heart rate for the\nfeature-level evaluation. It is known that R-waves\nin real 12-lead ECG signals will theoretically occur\nsimultaneously, and the generated signals should\nmeet this requirement. Firstly, the mean heart rate\n(MHR) at the jth lead could be calculated, as\nshown in Eq.6.\n$MHR(j) = \\frac{60 \\times (n \u2013 1)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (R(i + 1, j) \u2013 R(i, j))}$\t(6)\nIn Eq.6, the ith detected R-wave in jth lead\nwill be denoted as $R(i,j)$, and it is expressed\nin seconds. Therefore, MHR could represent the\nheartbeat per minute. Since the 12 heart rates\nare obtained, it is time to measure the heart rate\nconsistency. In addition, some ECG signals col-\nlected in real-world applications will be difficult\nfor R-wave detection of their enormous noise, so\nit is unnecessary to choose any lead as a ref-\nerence. Based on the 12 MHR from different\n12-lead ECG, the average value MMHR could\nbe computed with Eq.7. Further, the feature-level\nevaluation in this 12-lead ECG reconstruction\ntask will involve standard deviation (SD), Range\n(the difference between maximum and minimum),\nand coefficient of variation (CV), and they are\nexpressed as MHRSD, MHRRange and MHRCV\nrespectively. The calculation processes could be\nseen in Eq.8, Eq.9 and Eq.10, respectively.\n$MMHR = \\frac{1}{12}\\sum_{j=1}^{12}(MHR(j))$\t(7)\n$MHR_{SD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{12}\\sum_{j=1}^{12}(MHR(j) \u2013 MMHR)^2}$\t(8)\n$MHR_{Range} = max(MHR) \u2013 min(MHR)$\t(9)\n$MHR_{CV} = \\frac{MHR_{SD}}{MMHR}$\t(10)\nThe reference values are from the original 12-\nlead ECG, which might be a bit noisy. These\nfeature-level values should be small if the inter-\nlead heart rates are consistent. Additionally, the\ngenerated signals could provide a smaller result,\nfor the generative models can reduce the noise.\n4.6.3 Diagnostic-Level\nFurther, this study also adopts the diagnostic-level\nevaluation for this 12-lead ECG reconstruction\ntask. In the real-world application, there are some\ntrained classifiers with 12-lead ECG as input,\nwhich are difficult to address some limited-lead\nECG. The proposed framework could convert the\nlimit-lead (even single-lead) ECG into 12-lead\nECG, which bridges the limited-lead ECG to the\ntrained classifiers. Therefore, it is necessary to\nevaluate the classification performance with the\ngenerated 12-lead ECG. The representative clas-\nsification metric will be used in this study, mainly\nincluding the precision (Pre), recall (Rec), speci-\nficity (Spe) and F1 score, as shown in literature[5].\nThe classification metric will be related to the\nTrue Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False\nPositive (FP) and False Negative (FN) for a spe-\ncial class, as seen in Eq.11, Eq.12, Eq.13 and\nEq.14.\n$Pre = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$\t(11)\n$Rec = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$\t(12)\n$Spe = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$\t(13)\n$F1 = \\frac{2 \\times TP}{2\\times TP+FN + FP}$\t(14)\nAt the same time, the original classification\nperformance with the real 12-lead ECG will be set\nas the standard reference, and the generated 12-\nlead ECG with other methods will be used in the\nresult comparison."}, {"title": "5 Results and Discussion", "content": "This study adopts a novel generative model to\nreconstruct 12-lead ECG with the single-lead\nECG, using an autoencoder for 12-lead ECG\nreconstruction. Firstly, the training process details\ncan be illustrated as seen in Fig.3.\nAs seen in Fig.3, with the training epochs\nincreasing, the mean square error will be smaller\nand smaller, while the Pearson correlation coeffi-\ncient will be bigger and bigger. The training set\nwill be used to weight updating, and the valida-\ntion set will be used for model selection. Based on\nthe training process, the saved model can be with\n0.038 in mean square error and 0.7709 in Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient.\n5.1 Case Study\nFurther, to show the advantages of the proposed\nframework, the generated and real 12-lead ECG\nshould be clearly shown, in Fig.4, in which the\ngenerated and the real signals are colored blue and\nred.\nFig.4 demonstrates the great generation ability\nof the proposed framework. For example, the aver-\nage MSE and PCC between the generated and\nreal 12-lead ECG is 0.0032 and 0.9560, and it is\nconcluded that the generator can generate 12-lead\nECG with single-lead ECG. Besides the inter-\nnal testing dataset (i.e., PTB-XL), the external\ntesting dataset's (i.e., CPSC2018) reconstruction\nperformance will demonstrate the proposed frame-\nwork's advantages from another aspect, as seen in\nFig.5.\nBased on the experimental result provided\nin Fig.4 and Fig.5, it is shown that the multi-\nchannel masked autoencoder (MCMA) could be\nused to reconstruct the 12-lead ECG with single-\nlead ECG. In the clinical practice, the ECG\ncollected by wearable devices could be with dif-\nferent signal length, instead of the fixed length. It\nis necessary to demonstrate the proposed frame-\nwork cloud also works with the variable-duration\nECG signals, and the signal reconstruction result\nwith 10-second ECG is seen in Fig.6. In this case,\nthe 5000 points should be filled with the extra 120\npoints, and it could be as the 5 individual sam-\nples for MCMA to reconstruct 12-lead ECG with\nsingle-lead ECG as input.\nTo evaluate the 12-lead ECG reconstruction\nperformance for the proposed framework, a com-\nprehensive evaluation benchmark is built in the\nmentioned content, named ECGGenEval. There-\nfore, the experimental results for MCMA are\ncalculated in this section with the proposed bench-\nmark, ECGGenEval, including the signal-level,\nfeature-level, and diagnostic-level evaluation.\n5.2 Signal-Level\nFirst of all, the signal-level evaluation is the pri-\nmary evaluation metric, such as MSE and PCC.\nUnlike the traditional methods, this scheme has\nthe advantage that arbitary single-lead ECG can\nbe output to 12-lead ECG without training mul-\ntiple generative models, effectively reducing the\nmodel training cost. The experimental results of\nMSE and PCC are shown in Table 5, where the\nhorizontal direction represents the output and the\nvertical direction represents the input. Besides,\nthe reconstruction performance in the external\ndataset, CPSC2018, is seen in Table 6.\nBased on the mentioned experimental results,\nit is known that the proposed framework could\nreconstruct high-fidelity 12-lead ECG with single-\nlead ECG. The average MSE and PCC in PTB-XL\nare 0.0178 and 0.7698, while the average MSE\nand PCC in CPSC2018 are 0.0658 and 0.7237,\nrespectively. The reconstruction performance in\nthe internal and external testing dataset could\ndemonstrate its advantages, and MCMA could\nreconstruct the standard 12-lead ECG with arbi-\ntrary single-lead ECG as input. Therefore, the\nproposed method can provide a feasible solu-\ntion when collecting the standard 12-lead ECG\nis inconvenient and difficult, like remote cardiac\nhealthcare.\n5.3 Feature-Level\nTo avoid the noise influence, and meet the clinical\nrequirement, this study proposes the feature-level\nevaluation metric, including the standard devia-\ntion MHRSD, Range MHRRange and coefficient\nof variation MHRCV. The feature-level evalua-\ntion results in the internal testing set PTB-XL and\nexternal testing set CPSC2018 are shown in Table\n7 and Table 8, respectively. Since the proposed\nmethod can convert arbitary single-lead ECG into\n12-lead ECG, these tables will involve 13 groups\nof experimental results, the first group will be the\nreference value as the original 12-lead ECG input.\nTable 7 demonstrates that the heart rate esti-\nmation in different leads is similar in the generated\n12-lead ECG and better than the original 12-lead\nECG. Normally, the estimated heart rate from\nthe real 12-lead ECG might be different, for the\nchannel-special noise existing, while the estimated\nvalue should be the same theoretically. At the\nsame time, the optimal result is from the gen-\nerated 12-lead ECG by lead V4 ECG. In this\nexperiment, the R-peak recognition algorithm [47]\nmight influence the experimental result.\nBased on the experimental result on Table 7\nand Table 8, the conclusion can be drawn as fol-\nlowing. For CPSC2018, the optimal result is from\nthe generated 12-lead ECG by lead II ECG. The\ngenerated 12-lead ECG from arbitary single-lead\nECG could produce a good heart rate consis-\ntency in different leads, and it can even be better\nthan the original 12-lead ECG in some cases,\ndue to the ECG signal denoising function in the\nproposed framework. Therefore, the feature-level\nevaluation can demonstrate the advantages of the\nMCMA. Additionally, the ECG morphological fea-\ntures in the single-lead would like to be calculated,\ndemonstrating the similarity and consistency in\nthe generated and real ECG signals.\nTaking lead I as example, Table 9 shows\nthe difference between the generated signals\nfrom 12 different inputs and the real ECG,\nincluding the Heart rate (HR, unit: bpm),\nP_amplitude (P_amp, unit: mv), P_duration\n(P_dur, unit: ms), PR_interval (PR, unit: ms),\nQRS_amplitude (QRS_amp, unit: unit: mv),\nQRS-duration (QRS_dur, unit: ms), T_amplitude\n(Tamp, unit: mv), ST (unit: ms), QT_interval\n(QT, unit: ms), QTc (unit: ms), and Heart rate\nvariation (unit: ms). In this table, amp and\ndur represent the amplitude and duration, bpm\nmeans beat per minute, while ms and mv are\nmillisecond and millivolt. As a reference, the\ncalculated morphological feature values for the\noriginal lead I ECG are 74.2593bpm, 0.1159mv,\n118.9081ms, 173.9268ms, 0.8535mv, 92.2338ms,\n0.2123mv, 124.9686ms, 410.7288ms, 452.4418ms,\n68.8162ms. Since the proposed framework could\nconvert arbitary single-lead ECG into 12-lead\nECG, Table 9 involves 12 groups of experimental\nresult, including lead I ECG.\nBased on Table 9, the ECG morphological fea-\ntures of the generated ECG are extremely close to\nthat of the original real ECG. The duration simi-\nlarity is better than amplitude similarity. Like the\nheart rate, the maximum difference is 0.8456 and\n1.23% in lead aVF, which largely presents the fea-\nsibility of the proposed framework. Besides, it is\nnecessary to study other leads with some cutting-\nedge technologies, and lead I is one of the mostly\nused cases in the standard 12-lead ECG. Besides\nthe R-peak, it is difficult to find the morpholog-\nical features with other lead ECG, especially the\nsubtle feature. Therefore, ECGGenEval focuses on\nthe mean heart rate in different leads ECG for\nfeature-level evaluation, like Table 8 and Table 7.\n5.4 Diagnostic-Level\nThe downstream task can demonstrate the clini-\ncal importance of the generated 12-lead ECG, and\nthe classifier is trained and validated by Ribeiro\net al[5]. The proposed framework could generate\n12-lead ECG with single-lead ECG, and the single-\nlead ECG could not be processed by a classifier"}, {"title": "5.5 Comparison", "content": "MCMA will be compared with other research\nworks, including Grag et al[30", "al[32": "and\nJoo et al[33", "30": "adopts\nthe lead II, while Seo et al [32", "al[33": "nutilizes the lead I.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The Internet has evolved to become a global platform\nthrough which anyone can conveniently disseminate,\nshare, and communicate ideas. Despite many\nadvantages, misuse of the Internet has become ever\nmore serious, however. Hackers, extremist groups,\nhate groups, and racial supremacy groups are using\nthe Web to conduct criminal activities, to facilitate\ninternal communications, to attack organizations,\ngovernments and to promote their ideology.\nComputer breaches making it to the news is common\nthese days, these cyber-attackers post messages to\nlarge companies and organizations asking for\nmunitions, financial support, and volunteers [4].\nTherefore, it has become important to obtain some\nform of intelligence that permits better\nunderstanding of hacking actions of hackers and\ncriminal groups.\nIn this paper, we have chosen Internet of Things\n(IoT), as a vulnerability since it is an emerging\ntechnology and easy to exploit [2], and used our\nmethodology to know how much these groups target\nIoT. From our analysis of 23 criminal websites on\nDark web in this paper, we have found that objects\nas innocuous as a small sensor collect, can cause\nserious damage if exploited. IoT creates a whole new\nworld for cyber-attackers to exploit. These hacker\ngroups typically do not discriminate when they\ntarget anyone\nthey take any weakness or vulnerability they can\naccess.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows, the\nsecond section gives overview about the concepts we\nhave proposed in this paper, third section describes a\nmethodology for collecting, analyzing the Dark Web\ninformation and discovering vulnerabilities. The\nfourth section describes about how that methodology\nwas applied in a case study of IoT using Shodan, the\nIoT search engine. The last section concludes the\nstudy and discusses some solutions."}, {"title": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Use of Dark Web", "content": "Hackers, Criminals and Terrorists use the Web to\nfacilitate their illegal activities. Since the advent of\nDark web, dozens of new bazaars have sprung up,\noffering an exhilarating and terrifying array of\nproducts such as prescription pills, meth, heroin,\nspeed, crack, guns, stolen identities, gold and erotica.\nDark web is also used for propagating extremism,\ncommunication between terrorists/criminals, sharing\nthe knowledge of illegal hacks, attacks and all that\ninformation that enables harmful activities to the\nsociety. On the Dark web most of the markets\nconduct business in bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that\nallows for anonymous online payments. As per one\nstudy, criminals and terrorists sell drugs using\nBitcoins and use those bitcoins to purchase guns and\nmunition. Navigating through multiple posts on dark-\nmarket called Hansa Market we identified one such\nwebsite Arms and Ammunition. They pose serious\nthreats to any nation, both internally and externally,\nand this is why developing threat intelligence is\nimportant."}, {"title": "2.2 IoT devices through Shodan", "content": "We have chosen IoT because they will have high\nimpact on several aspects of everyday life. We will\nspend a lot of time with them like our mobile phones,\nand they will predict our behavior. Despite multitude\nof uses, IoT devices are prone to hacks and\nmalfunctions. And most of these devices run on low\npower CPU and custom-operating system that cannot\nsupport encryption-decryption mechanism hence are\nlow on security. For example, sensor in a Smart\nThermostat that does way more than telling\ntemperature, it stores data on a central location that\nhelps predict users' temperature patterns. Same\nthermostat at home is not so dangerous when hacked\nbut in Industrial control systems even a small data\nmanipulation through sensors could be disastrous.\nAnd if hackers or criminals are able to exploit the\nvulnerability of these critical IoT devices then they\ncould probably threaten people based on their past\nbehavior or could shut down power stations. To\ndiscover vulnerable IoT devices we have used\nShodan.\nShodan is a IoT search engine that crawls over the\ninternet to find devices whose ports are open and can\nestablish a successful session. It can identify any\ndevice connected to the internet like Computer\nservers, Webcams, Industrial Control Systems, Power\nPlants, Traffic Signals, or almost any device. It is a\nfairly new search engine to specifically search IoT\ndevices, and we have chosen this because few\nresearch studies conducted on its genuineness has\nproven it reliable. In a research study, conducted for\nseveral months, they connected few devices to the\nInternet for first time to see if Shodan lists them, and\nfound that after 14 days the data about those devices\nlike IP, Port, Location, Device details appeared on\nShodan [1]. As per their findings Shodan collects\ninformation through device's service banner\ninterrogation. Note that a service banner refers to\ninformation provided by a system in response to a\nconnection request. Banner grabbing is an act of\nobtaining active information about a service or\nsystem through port interrogation. Based on the\nvarious filters available like: IP address, port,\nCountry, City, Latitudes and Longitudes, device\ninformation (OS), one can exploit the vulnerable\ndevices. However, this is very helpful for threat\nintelligence."}, {"title": "2.3 Developing Cyber Threat Intelligence", "content": "Our approach was that whether by gathering and\nprocessing dark web contents can we develop threat\nintelligence in order to protect vulnerable IoT\ndevices.

A METHODOLOGY FOR\nCOLLECTING AND ANALYZING DARK\nWEB INFORMATION", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 The Methodology", "content": "To address threats from the wide range of\ninformation sources that hackers, criminals and\nterrorists use to conduct destructive activities, we\nhave proposed a methodology integrating various\ninformation collection and analysis techniques, and\nhuman domain knowledge."}, {"title": "3.2 Application of the Methodology", "content": "Although the Internet has been publicly available\nsince the 1990s, the Dark Web emerged only in the\nrecent years. A lack of useful methodology designed\nfor finding vulnerabilities on the Dark Web has\nlimited the capability to fight against cyber-crimes\n[23]. As discussed above, the proposed methodology\nhas incorporated various data and Web mining\ntechnologies while still allowing human domain\nknowledge to guide their application. This\nmethodology can be implemented to discover desired\ncriminal groups and know what they discuss about\nand potentially guide intelligence making. Its semi-\nautomated nature combines machine efficiency with\nthe advantages of human precision."}, {"title": "4. IoT SCANNING TO PREDICT CYBER\nATTACK: A CASE STUDY", "content": "To demonstrate the value and usability of our\nmethodology, we have applied it to collecting and\nanalyzing the use of Web by of hackers, terrorists and\ncriminals to exploit Internet of Things, an emerging\ntechnology with various loopholes. First we have\nidentified dark-market sites, forums, blogs over the\nWeb, then we have analyzed IoT exploitation through\nthese websites. Various research studies contend that\nnearly 70% of the IoT devices are vulnerable and\nthese are just 0.1% of the devices connected to the\nInternet, by 2020 there will be 26 billion devices\nconnected to the Internet. Hackers will get a whole\nnew world to attack with this incoming, this is the\nreason we have chosen IoT devices in our case study.\nWe describe the steps for applying our methodology\nas described in Figure 1."}, {"title": "4.1 Collection", "content": "To collect data, we first identified few suspicious\nURLs using Web search, referencing Dark web\nmarkets and we did Web Spidering with the 'Open\nWeb Spidering' tool. For example: we started our\nsearch with keyword 'freedom fighters' and 'digital\nrobinhood', and found these 4 URLs which seemed\nintriguing HackHound (forum for hackers), Du Bist\nAnonymous (anonymous supporter group website),\nCiHad.net (suspicious website of terror group), Intel\nExchange (political ideology website). Keeping these\ncategories as our reference led us to some other\nwebsites while collecting the data. Then we\nperformed same search specifically on the Dark web\nsearch engines Torch, Grams and Ahmia but the\nresults were scattered and we stored them anyway.\nMost of them pointed to the Dark web markets but\nbrowsing manually to those markets we found\nhacking services offered and required equally. Then\nwe chose these keywords 'hacking services', 'free\nworld', 'personal army', 'internet of things' gave us\nthat various results. Overall, the information we\ncollected was in few hundreds and it would be\ninteresting future direction to study that data\ncollection technique affects the quality of analysis of\nresults."}, {"title": "4.2 Filtering", "content": "We conducted two rounds of filtering. First, we\nmanually filtered unrelated sites, such as news,\ngames, and porn sites that had no reference to\nhacking. We retained websites of forums, blogs,\nideology discussions, dark-markets for hacking and\nammunition services. Thirty-Two sites remained after\nthis round of filtering.\nSecond, since we were not domain experts and did\nnot know any other language than English, so with\nlittle knowledge that we had from our study so far,\nwe manually removed some more websites that felt\nlittle irrelevant and similar to English forum websites\nwe had in our results."}, {"title": "4.3 Analysis", "content": null}, {"title": "4.3.1 Classification and Usage of Websites", "content": "We performed clustering and classification of the\nremaining 23 websites that remained. These websites\nwere a good mix that gave us variety of information\nwe needed to perform our analysis."}, {"title": "4.3.2 Shodan: Discovering vulnerable IoT devices", "content": "On Shodan, we followed below steps to do our\nAnalysis:\n1. Configured Shodan's Rest API with Python.\n2. Searched for the keyword - 'sensor'.\n3. Took our results in .csv format.\n4. Used ArcGIS and Excel for various analytics.\nWe searched for 'sensor' on Shodan because we\nfound maximum results of hacking sensors in IoT\ndevices and so we wanted to see how specifically the\nsensors re vulnerable and if they can be discovered\neasily.\nOn executing the above python script mentioned in\nFigure 3, we found 582 results for the sensors. In the\ntry block of above code, we are capturing number of\nresults and filtering Company, IP Address, Port,\nOperating System, Data information like-Content\nType, Authentication protocol, and Location details\nsuch as in which Country and City they were located.\nThe results we got from our Shodan search gave us\nnearly every detail of the device such as Company\nname, Location, IP address and Port. With this\ninformation one can easily perform various analytics\nbecause it exposes the device to range of security\nexploits such as cross-site scripting, denial-of-service\nattack, SQL injection, unexpected application\ntermination or arbitrary code execution, also its\nconnection is not over SSL. First, image in Figure 4\nshows us vulnerable device locations, and area of ther\nvulnerability. Second, we manually honed through\nthe IP addresses giving access directly, notice the\nimage two and three in Figure 4 we got access to a\npressure sensing device 'Pbar-box4' and a\ntemperature sensing device \u2018Byt'. We technically had\nall the controls of these devices, we could see past\ntemperature readings, and manipulate with the admin\nsettings and change email-ids where the data was\nbeing sent, see the image four in Figure 4, which\nshows an example of Control Panel for 'Byt' device."}, {"title": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "Analyzing and Collecting the Dark Web information\ncan be very challenging because cyber-attackers can\neasily hide their identities and remove traces of their\nactivities on the Web. The abundance of Web\ninformation has made it difficult to obtain a\ncomprehensive picture of their activities. Hence, it\ncan be even more difficult to figure out their next\npoint of attack. In this article, we have proposed a\nmethodology to address these problems. Using some\nWeb mining, content analysis, visualization\ntechniques, the methodology exploited various\ninformation sources and analyze 23 Hacker Web sites\nfor IoT vulnerabilities. Information Clustering was\nused to cluster and differentiate between novice and\nexperienced Hackers on the Web. Our detailed\nevaluation showed that the methodology yielded\npromising results that would be very useful to assist\ninvestigation on discovering new vulnerabilities and\ntheir sources. For IoT we want to propose some\nsolutions: 1. Standards must be laid out in\nmanufacturing hardware/software of the IoT devices\nthat are strict on security. 2. The IoT software must\nbe developed by dedicated companies that follows\nIoT security protocols religiously. 3. Best practice\nmust be followed by the users and people who\nconfigure these IoT devices. We have pursued this\nresearch from multiple directions, and we believe it\nwill support the existing literature on cyber-security\nthat could potentially guide in both policy-making\nand threat intelligence research."}]}

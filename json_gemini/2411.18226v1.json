The manual processes involved in analyzing project structure, resolving\ndependencies, and modifying code are often prone to human error and inefficiencies. The\nFeature-Factory framework addresses these challenges by utilizing Generative AI to auto-\nmate and optimize the entire process. This paper discusses the mathematical model and\nimplementation details behind this innovative solution.\nIntegrating features into existing systems requires developers to analyze large codebases,\nidentify dependencies, and implement changes without introducing errors. This process is\nfurther complicated by complex project structures, heterogeneous programming languages,\nand evolving requirements. Existing methods primarily rely on static analysis tools and\nmanual intervention, which are time-consuming and error-prone. The lack of a unified\nframework for automating feature integration has been a persistent limitation in the field.\nRecent advancements in software engineering and machine learning have introduced var-\nious tools and methodologies for automating aspects of feature integration.

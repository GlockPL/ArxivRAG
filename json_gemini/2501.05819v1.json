INTRODUCTION", "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being employed across various sectors, including energy, public safety, agriculture, and smart cities, where they serve as data collectors, base stations, and relays. UAVs also play a crucial role in the development of 5th generation (5G) networks, contributing to the realization of 5G's goals, including Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency communications (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC). UAVs are also expected to play a pivotal role in 6th generation (6G) networks, enabling improved data collection and analysis. The key advantages of UAVs lie in their rapid deployment, controlled mobility, and the ability to establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications, which facilitate high-speed data transmission [1].\nDecision-making refers to selecting the best course of action from multiple alternatives, such as determining optimal flight paths or scheduling data transmission. Alongside digital modeling, it is an indispensable process in UAV communications. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a transformative approach within Artificial Intelligence (AI), offering promising solutions to complex decision-making challenges in UAV communications. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can automate data collection tasks in UAV-assisted sensor networks; however, low sample efficiency often hinders it. Sample efficiency refers to the ability of an RL algorithm to learn effectively from a limited number of interactions with the environment. Moreover, its action-oriented nature necessitates prolonged and extensive interactions within dynamic environments, posing significant challenges to its practical deployment. Immersive digital modeling systems, such as Digital Twins (DTs), replicate UAV elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware in a virtual counterpart. These physical and digital counterparts exchange inputs and operations seamlessly through real-time data communication. A UAV swarm with diverse aerial roles can be effectively modeled using DTs to enable collaboration, enhance safety, and mitigate challenges such as the simulation-to-reality gap. However, DT modeling involves significant complexities in decision-making and data management. RL models, often used within DT frameworks, rely on extensive training data to develop accurate predictions. Acquiring sufficient and representative training data poses a great challenge, particularly for systems with limited historical datasets or scenarios [2], [3].\nDiffusion Models (DMs), a class of generative AI, show great potential in addressing the above challenges. Unlike traditional approaches focusing on class boundaries, DMs learn the underlying probability distribution from training data, allowing them to generate trustworthy new samples based on this learned distribution. DMs can synthesize data to help RL models overcome low sample efficiency, improve their policies for better handling of UAV dynamic environments, and create realistic simulation environments for UAV training. In addition, DMs can help DT-assisted UAVs overcome data scarcity, improve decision-making when integrated with RL, and enhance UAV modeling accuracy. Sun et al. [4] demonstrate the use of generative AI to enhance RL. Moreover, Zhu et al. [5] survey the applications of DMs in RL, and Sun et al. [6] systematically showcase the adoption of generative AI in optimizing UAV communication and networking problems.\nIn particular, this paper discusses how DMs can enhance RL-assisted UAV communications by improving sample efficiency, providing an enhanced policy network, and generating realistic training environments. We also investigate how DMs can benefit DT-assisted UAV communications by generating synthetic data, improving decision-making, and refining dynamic modeling."}, {"title": "II. OVERVIEW OF DIFFUSION MODEL AND UAV COMMUNICATIONS", "content": "This section provides an overview of DMs and UAV communications. We delve into the mechanisms of DMs, their application paradigms, and their main variants. We outline UAV applications and also discuss their unique features."}, {"title": "A. Diffusion Model", "content": "DMs represent a class of probabilistic generative models that operate by incrementally corrupting data through the addition of noise and subsequently learning to reverse this process to generate samples. DMs are primarily utilized in two application paradigms: unconditional and conditional generation. Similar to other generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Flow-Based Models. Unconditional generation serves to evaluate the fundamental capabilities of the model, while conditional generation targets application-specific objectives by enabling control over generated outputs through predefined conditions. Conditional DMs are highly valuable in UAV communications, as they enable precise control over outputs based on user inputs or specific requirements. By conditioning variables such as labels, text, or images, DMs allow users to steer the generation process to align with desired outcomes. This capability is particularly critical for creative and operational tasks, where managing the style, class, or attributes of generated content, such as specific UAV states, is essential. In UAV communication, conditional generation facilitates fine-tuned control over state outputs, ensuring that the system meets precise operational demands.\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) utilize two Markov chains: a forward chain that incrementally corrupts the data by adding noise and a reverse chain that reconstructs the original data from the noisy inputs. The forward chain is designed to map the data distribution to a simple prior, commonly a standard Gaussian distribution. The reverse chain is trained using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to approximate the transition kernels and reverse the noise-adding process. New data points are generated by first sampling from the prior distribution and then sequentially passing through the reverse Markov chain to produce realistic outputs.\nScore-based Generative Models (SGMs) operate by perturbing data with progressively increasing levels of Gaussian noise and leveraging a DNN to estimate the score functions for the resulting noisy data distributions, conditioned on the noise levels. New samples are generated by integrating these score functions at decreasing noise levels using various sampling strategies, such as Langevin Monte Carlo, Stochastic Differential Equations, Ordinary Differential Equations, or Hybrid approaches. A key advantage of SGMs is the decoupling of the training and sampling processes, which enables the flexibility to apply different sampling techniques after the score functions have been estimated [7]."}, {"title": "B. UAV Communications", "content": "UAVs have become integral to modern technological advancements, driving transformative changes across multiple sectors. They have revolutionized applications in agriculture, public safety, environmental monitoring, and security. In agriculture, UAVs are particularly promising for enabling precision farming, aligning with the European Union's emphasis on sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural practices. Moreover, UAVs have demonstrated exceptional utility in evaluating hazardous environments, executing search and rescue (SAR) operations, collecting evidence for investigations, and identifying potential threats, thereby reinforcing their value in critical and high-stakes scenarios.\nUAV communications differ significantly from terrestrial communications due to factors such as the high altitude and mobility of UAVs, the likelihood of LoS channels between UAVs and ground sensors, varying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for payload and non-payload data, strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWAP) constraints of UAVs, and the need to jointly optimize UAV mobility control and communication scheduling/resource allocation to maximize system performance."}, {"title": "III. DIFFUSION MODEL INTEGRATION WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS", "content": "This section investigates how DMs integration with RL contributes to generating synthetic data, creating simulation environment, and improving policy network.\nA well-known issue of RL algorithms is low sample efficiency, and further data can be scarce and limited in UAV communications. Data collection with RL can be costly or impractical in the real-world UAV scenario since learning optimal policies often requires long and extensive environmental interactions. Moreover, generalization capabilities are limited.\nIn a UAV swarm, UAVs cannot share knowledge in real-time due to limited coverage and fast movements, so they face data scarcity, which affects tasks such as trajectory planning and collision avoidance. Each UAV relies on limited local data for trajectory planning without constant real-time velocity exchange, making coordinated decision-making difficult. Adopting DMs to augment data can be a solution. DMs can create novel synthetic velocity samples by learning the local velocity distribution. The main idea is to generate velocity states that are as similar as possible to the states the UAV could receive from the neighbors and use them at earlier stages of training."}, {"title": "A. Generating Synthetic Data", "content": "A common use of DMs in UAVs is to create synthetic data, addressing the data scarcity challenge often encountered in UAV communications. DMs serve as natural data synthesizers for RL training, generating diverse, realistic data. Traditional data augmentation in RL typically involves adding minor perturbations to states and actions to maintain consistency with environmental dynamics. However, DMs can more effectively generate varied synthetic samples, enhancing training diversity while aligning closely with the environment's underlying dynamics.\nIn addition, UAVs offer dynamic mobility in three-dimensional space, in contrast to the fixed positioning of terrestrial gateways. This mobility results in time-varying air-to-ground channels but also allows UAVs to adjust their position, altitude, speed, heading, and trajectories to match communication targets, improving overall network performance through communication-aware mobility control. However, UAV operations are subject to SWAP limitations that impact endurance, computing capacity, and communication efficiency. Unlike terrestrial systems with stable power supply at fixed gateways, UAV systems must rely on efficient power management, lightweight hardware, and optimized communication protocols to operate within these constraints [2]."}, {"title": "B. Improved Policy Network", "content": "The reverse process of the DMs is well-suited to the policy networks of RL, where multi-round iterations and denoising processes assist UAVs in exploring better actions. DM-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [8] scheme can enhance UAV adaptability to dynamic environments. The DMs can be used as a policy network of RL algorithms like SAC, enabling the generation of action distributions based on observed states. This approach can leverage the reverse process of the DMs to enhance decision-making, particularly in complex and dynamic UAV environments. The DM can also be integrated into the actor network of the conventional TD3 algorithm [9] to significantly improve decision-making by providing a more diverse set of possible actions. In particular, the DM facilitates the creation of complex action sets refined by the learned reverse process, allowing direct selection of actions from the generative distribution [11]."}, {"title": "C. Training Environment", "content": "Because DMs excel at learning and modeling complex data distributions, they are particularly well suited for simulating realistic environments for UAV training. In scenarios such as SAR operations, a UAV is not allowed to train on a trial-and-error basis. In such areas, the risk of damaging equipment or injuring people makes trial-and-error training in real-time impractical. Instead, UAVs can be trained in simulated environments to ensure safety while optimizing performance for real-world missions [4]."}, {"title": "D. Lesson Learned", "content": "DMs solve key challenges in RL-assisted UAV communication, such as data scarcity, low sample efficiency, and limited generalization, by generating diverse and realistic synthetic data that increase training diversity and simulate realistic environments. DMs can generate visual synthetic data and improve policy networks that enable safer, more effective training in dynamic and high-risk UAV scenarios.\nTo effectively facilitate the operation of UAV swarms, there is an urgent need for precise modeling and control. However, existing technologies fail to fulfill these objectives. Immersive technologies like DTs can effectively realize these goals. DTs are critical for modeling and controlling the behavior of UAVs."}, {"title": "IV.

Data Transmission and Synchronization", "content": "DMs can be integrated into a DT to improve data transmission and synchronization. The DM is trained offline to handle data compression, noise reduction, and signal reconstruction tasks, enabling efficient and reliable communication between the DT and UAV. By acting as a generative transmitter and receiver, the DM compresses critical information for transmission and restores it to its original state upon arrival, even over noisy channels. This approach ensures real-time synchronization between the UAV and its DT enhancing operational efficiency and supporting seamless coordination in dynamic UAV environments [12]."}, {"title": "B. Data Scarcity", "content": "RL models rely on training data to learn and generate accurate predictions. However, obtaining adequate and representative training datasets can be challenging, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data. To overcome data scarcity, operators may need to employ strategies such as data augmentation or the generation of synthetic datasets to enhance the availability and diversity of training data [2].

Conditional Generation", "content": "ML models facilitate decision-making, maintenance strategies, process optimization, and resource allocation in DT environments by analyzing data and extracting insights from observed trends. DTs acquire network data, recreate the network environment, and serve as a foundation for training ML models. RL models complement this process by providing data-driven solutions for network decision-making, leveraging real-time network conditions and historical data to optimize performance. [2]. DM facilitates conditional generation and network decision-making through reverse diffusion and Markovian transition processes. A return-conditional DM guides the generation of solutions based on specific returns. The model learns to produce decisions that optimize particular objectives by conditioning on target returns. A return-conditional DM can greatly enhance the effectiveness of a DT-assisted UAV by enhancing training efficiency and inference performance [13]."}, {"title": "D. Task Coordination", "content": "Task coordination for UAVs often involves executing multiple tasks concurrently, collaborating with other UAVs, and interacting with environmental objects. DTs designed to handle these complexities must incorporate advanced modeling and simulation capabilities, along with seamless integration of ML techniques, to effectively manage interactions and optimize performance. Utilizing return-conditioned DM to perform planning or trajectory generation achieves favorable performance in multi-task operation, but relies on well-defined reward functions, which require amounts of human effort."}, {"title": "E. Dynamic Modeling", "content": "The DroneDiffusion framework [14] uses DDPM to learn complex quadrotor dynamics. It aims to improve the control of quadrotors by accurately modeling the multimodal and stochastic nature of flight dynamics, including unpredictable environmental factors such as wind or payload changes. Traditional models often lack the adaptability required for these dynamic conditions, while the proposed DDPM-based approach generalizes effectively across different flight scenarios. The DDPM works with a sequence of noise and denoising steps. In the forward process, noise is added to the data representing the quadrotor dynamics, resulting in multiple variations that capture possible state uncertainties. The model gradually denoises these states in the reverse process and learns a predictive distribution of the quadrotor dynamics. This denoised prediction of the residual dynamics is then integrated into a controller, which uses it to make robust adjustments for stable and precise trajectory tracking in real-time. The framework has shown enhanced stability and adaptability in both simulated and real-world tests across different trajectories and conditions. Based on the DroneDiffusion framework a DT framework could use DDPMs to improve modeling and control by simulating complex UAV dynamics."}, {"title": "F.

The experimental results compare three scenarios: Development solely in the DT environment, development in DT and testing in the real world without calibration, and development in DT with calibration using real-world data and subsequent testing in the real world. These results showed significant performance improvements from real-world calibration, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DT framework in bridging the gap between simulation and reality.

DMs for Improving Security", "content": "The use of DMs for anomaly detection offers remarkable advantages, such as effective detection of complicated, high-dimensional data patterns, insensitivity to noise, and the ability to identify anomalies precisely and incrementally. This approach suits multimodal data sets [17] and different normal behavior patterns. In addition, these models are highly scalable and versatile for deploying in UAV domains. DDPMs can be adapted for intruder detection [18] by using an unsupervised reconstruction error method to reduce the need for labeled data. The model learns a data distribution by adding noise to the input data in a forward process and then reverses this process to produce the original data distribution, which helps in detecting anomalies. The reconstruction error serves as an indicator of potential intruders, as anomalous data usually cannot be reconstructed accurately."}, {"title": "C.

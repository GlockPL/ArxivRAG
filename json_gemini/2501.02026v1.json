We introduce RDOLT (Recursive Decomposition of Logical Thought) prompting, a novel framework that significantly boosts LLM reasoning performance. RDOLT is built on three key innovations: (1) recursively breaking down complex reasoning tasks into sub-tasks of progressive complexity; (2) employing an advanced selection and scoring mechanism to identify the most promising reasoning thoughts; and (3) integrating a knowledge propagation module that mimics human learning by keeping track of strong and weak thoughts for information propagation. Our approach was evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including GSM8K8, SVAMP, MultiArith, LastLetter Concatenation, and Gaokao2023 Math. The results demonstrate that RDOLT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a 90.98% accuracy on GSM8K with ChatGPT-4 surpassing SOAT by 6.28%. Similar improvements were observed on other benchmarks, with accuracy gains ranging from 5.5% to 6.75%. These findings highlight RDOLT's potential to advance prompt engineering, offering a more effective and generalizable approach to complex reasoning tasks.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language understanding and text generation, enabling advancements in applications such as machine translation, question-answering systems, information retrieval, conversational agents, and text summarization. These models, trained on vast datasets, can generate human-like text and produce sophisticated responses, positioning them as key players in industries such as healthcare, education, and legal services. However, despite their achievement, LLMs still struggle with complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving, arithmetic, and common sense reasoning. These tasks require not only language comprehension but also the application of logical steps, deeper planning, and extensive thought exploration to form consistent and accurate answers. LLMs often fall short in these areas, generating incorrect or hallucinated responses, which underscores the need for enhanced techniques to improve reasoning capabilities.\nTo address these challenges, prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have been developed to guide LLMs in generating intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. CoT improves reasoning by generating intermediate solutions with \"step-by-step\" reasoning, thereby facilitating better logical progression. CoT has been further refined to Chain-of-Thought Self-consistency (CoT-SC), which asks models to generate consistent thought chains and derive a final answer through majority voting of generated thoughts. Least-to-Most (L2M) took a different approach to address complex problems by initially solving the simplest aspects, gradually progressing to the final solution of the task, where answers to simple aspects help the model understand the overall query. These methods have shown promise but still face significant limitations, particularly in their thought selection and scoring for intermediate thoughts.\nExisting techniques have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, yet they continue to exhibit critical shortcomings when applied to complex reasoning tasks. CoT operates by generating a sequential reasoning process, breaking tasks into intermediate steps to arrive at a final answer. While this approach aids in structured reasoning, it suffers from a notable limitation: if an incorrect intermediate thought is generated, it propagates to subsequent steps, compounding errors and leading to inaccurate conclusions. Wang et al. [2022] attempts to address this issue by generating multiple reasoning paths and using majority voting to determine the final answer. However, this method can be problematic when only two reasoning paths are generated or when the majority voting overlooks correct but rare outliers, leading to potentially sub-optimal decisions.\nThe design of Zhou et al. [2022], which scaffolds learning by progressing from simple to more complex sub-tasks, faces the problem of error propagation. If incorrect conclusions are drawn in the initial simpler steps, these errors can cascade, impacting the overall solution. Moreover, these methods fail to fully integrate their respective strengths. For example, while CoT focuses on logical breakdown, it lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to real-time complexity, and Least2Most, despite its step-wise progression, struggles with scaling effectively to more nuanced problems. Park et al. [2024] introduces alternative approach that improves reasoning by adding separators between thoughts to encourage clearer delineation between reasoning stages, seeks to combine reasoning with action by having models alternate between reasoning steps and taking actions (such as querying external knowledge sources) during the thought process it mitigates some issues related to thought propagation, its reliance on external actions introduces new challenges, such as dependency on the availability of accurate external knowledge.\nIn response to these persistent limitations, we propose a novel prompting technique called Recursive Decomposition of Logical Thoughts (RDoLT) designed to address the key shortcomings of previous methods by integrating a more dynamic and recursive structure into the reasoning process. RDoLT enhances traditional CoT and CoT-SC methodologies by breaking down tasks into three distinct levels of complexity-easy, intermediate, and final while incorporating a robust thought evaluation and scoring system as shown in Figl. Each stage generates multiple thoughts, assessed and scored based on four critical dimensional features: Logical Validity, Coherence, Simplicity, and Adaptiveness. These features allow RDOLT to evaluate thoughts not only based on their immediate correctness but also on their alignment with the overall task, their clarity, and their flexibility in different contexts.\nCrucially, RDoLT introduces a Knowledge Propagation Module (KPM), a novel mechanism that tracks both selected and rejected thoughts throughout the reasoning process. By storing and propagating information about rejected thoughts (classified as \u201cweak\"), RDOLT ensures that potentially valuable ideas are not lost prematurely. This allows the system to revisit rejected thoughts when they become relevant in later stages of reasoning, minimizing the risk\""}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "\u2022 Feedback Guided Thought Generation: Human feedback has been shown to enhance the performance of LLMs by providing an external evaluation that can refine model outputs. However, this feedback is often expensive and problematic to incorporate into an automated process. Consequently, researchers have begun to replace human feedback with heuristic functions, which serve as a more scalable solution.\nRecent advancements have introduced self-reflective mechanisms where models generate their own feedback to assess and improve outputs. These techniques are especially beneficial for code generation and other multi-step tasks, as seen in Chen et al. [2023], which utilizes execution results for refinement. However, these approaches typically follow a linear left-to-right process, which limits exploration of alternative reasoning paths. In contrast, RDOLT introduces a broader, more flexible scoring-based feedback mechanism. Each thought node generates multiple child nodes, allowing exploration of alternative reasoning and improving decision-making comprehensiveness.\n\u2022 Graph & Tree-Based Reasoning: Tree-based approaches, such as the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) method, organize reasoning paths into a tree structure, allowing models to explore multiple decision branches Yao et al. [2023a], Xie et al. [2023]. These methods are particularly suited for multi-step problem-solving, where each node represents a partial solution. However, ToT's rigid structure prohibits modification of intermediate nodes, which can result in a final solution that depends heavily on the initial steps. Once a branch is selected, there's no opportunity for feedback or revision until the final answer is generated, these methods are also very cost-intensive if a long tree of thought is generated. Graph-based approaches, such as Graph of Thoughts (GoT), offer more flexibility by connecting reasoning steps as nodes within a graph, enabling multiple solution paths to be explored"}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "The RDOLT employs a three-stage iterative reasoning process (Easy, Intermediate, Final) to systematically refine outputs. At each stage, candidate thoughts (T1, T2, T3, .Tn) are generated and evaluated using four scoring criteria: Logical Validity, Coherence, Simplicity, and Adaptiveness. Thoughts exceeding a predefined threshold are propagated to the next stage through the Knowledge Propagation Module (KPM), which integrates and refines selected outputs. This structured, score-driven approach ensures progressive enhancement of reasoning quality and convergence towards optimal solutions. The subsequent sections provide a detailed exposition of the framework's stages, the scoring methodology, and the propagation mechanism."}, {"title": "3.1 Task Decomposition", "content": "The initial phase involve the decomposition of the reasoning task into three distinct levels based on gradual and progressive complexity: easy, intermediate, and final. This hierarchical decomposition is more sophisticated than the (Zhou et al. [2022]) by incorporating a more granular and human-level intelligent method of task segmentation. Given a complex reasoning task R, we decompose it into three sub-tasks, P = {Reasy, Rintermediate, Rfinal}. Each sub-task is designed to incrementally build upon the previous one, ensuring that the model tackles simpler components first and progressively moves to more complex reasoning. The decomposition process can be represented as follows:\n$R_{easy} = f_{decomp}(R, \\theta_{easy})$ (1)\n$R_{intermediate} = f_{decomp}(R, O_{intermediate})$ (2)\n$R_{final} = f_{decomp} (R, O_{final})$ (3)\nThe transition between these levels is not merely sequential but involves a feedback mechanism where the output of each level informs the subsequent level. This recursive feedback mechanism can be defined as:\n$t_{k+1,i} = f_{feedback}(t_{k,i}, O_{k+1})$ (4)\nwhere k represents the current level. This feedback mechanism integrates the output of the k-th level to refine the input for the (k + 1)-th level, ensuring that knowledge and errors identified in earlier stages are propagated and corrected in later stages.\nThis approach significantly reduces cognitive overload on the model and mirrors the step-by-step approach humans naturally employ when solving complex problems. By systematically refining thoughts and leveraging a robust scoring system, the RDOLT framework enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs. This method is not only more nuanced but also more aligned with human cognitive processesWu et al. [2024], thereby improving the model's accuracy and consistency in solving complex reasoning tasks."}, {"title": "3.2 Thought Generation", "content": "Thought generation is a critical component that occurs within each of the decomposition levels: easy, intermediate, and final. The process involves generating multiple candidate thoughts for each task segment to ensure a diverse set of potential solutions is explored. For our framework, we set n (the number of thoughts generated per level) to three. Given a decomposed task Rk at level k, the thought generation process aims to produce a set of candidate thoughts Tk = {tk1, tk2, tk3}. Each thought is generated by the LLM based on the input X, the question Q, and any previously generated thoughts at that level. Formally, the thought generation process at level k is represented as:\n$t_{ki} \\sim p_{\\theta}(t_{ki} | I(t_{k1}, t_{k2},..., t_{k(i-1)}, X, Q))$, for i = 1, 2, 3 (5)\nwhere $p_{\\theta}$ denotes the probability distribution parameterized by \u03b8, and $I(.)$ indicates that the prompt includes all previous thoughts, task instructions X, and the corresponding question Q. The thoughts generated at each level TE = {tE1,E2,tE3}, T\u2081 = {t11,12,13}, and TF = {tF1,F2,F3} undergo evaluation based on predefined criteria in the subsequent scoring system step."}, {"title": "3.3 Scoring and Evaluation", "content": "The scoring system in our framework evaluates each generated thought at each decomposition level using four core features: Logical Validity, Coherence, Simplicity, and Adaptiveness. These features ensure that the selected thoughts are effective for reasoning and reflect human-like intelligence.\n\u2022 Logical Validity ($S_{valid}$) ensures the thought is logically sound. This can be represented as the negative penalty based on logical contradictions:\n$S_{valid}(t_{ki}) = \\sum_{r \\epsilon rules} I{violates(r, t_{ki})}$ (6)\nwhere I is an indicator function that is 1 if the thought tki violates a known logical rule r, and 0 otherwise. A lower score penalizes thoughts that violate known rules or facts. Human or model can both be used as a scorer of all these following steps.\n\u2022 Coherence ($S_{cohere}$) measures the degree to which the thought follows from previous thoughts, and can be defined as a similarity measure between the current thought and previous thoughts:\n$S_{cohere}(t_{ki} |{t_{k1,k2,..., t_{k(i-1)}}}) = \\frac{1}{i-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} sim(t_{ki}, t_{kj})$ (7)\nwhere sim(\u00b7) represents a similarity function (cosine similarity) between the current thought tki and process thoughts tkj. Sentences similarity can be calculated using any embedding or sentence transformer model; however to reduce the complexity of the whole proces we let LLM score the thought Yao [2024].\n\u2022 Simplicity ($S_{simple}$) evaluates the clarity and conciseness of a thought, inversely related to its complexity. This can be modeled by penalizing the length or complexity of the thought:\n$S_{simple}(t_{ki}) = -complexity(t_{ki})$ (8)\nwhere complexity(tki) could represent the length of the thought or the number of steps in reasoning, with lower complexity resulting in a higher score.\n\u2022 Adaptiveness ($S_{adapt}$) assesses how well the thought aligns with the external context, such as the task instructions X and the question Q. It can be defined as:\n$S_{adapt} (t_{ki} | {X, Q}) = sim(t_{ki}, {X, Q})$ (9)\nwhere sim(\u00b7) measures the similarity between the thought and the context provided by X and Q.\nThe overall score for each thought tki is the sum of its individual feature scores:\n$S(t_{ki}) = S_{valid}(t_{ki}) + S_{cohere}(t_{ki}) + S_{simple}(t_{ki}) + S_{adapt}(t_{ki})$ (10)\nThought is selected if its total score exceeds a predefined threshold \u03c4 or if it maximizes the score among all thoughts in the current decomposition level:\n$t = arg max S(t_{ki})$ (11)"}, {"title": "3.4 Knowledge Propagation Module and Edge Case Management", "content": "The Knowledge Propagation Module (KPM) plays a crucial role in the RDOLT framework's reasoning process. It is responsible for managing knowledge and propagating it through the subsequent steps of reasoning. This module ensures that the flow of information remains coherent and consistent across all levels of decomposition, significantly enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the KPM manages the execution of the system, handles edge cases, and oversees the selection and rejection of thoughts, which is essential for maintaining the framework's overall accuracy.\nThe KPM tracks both selected and non-selected thoughts at each step of the reasoning process. Selected thoughts are those that have met the threshold criteria based on the scoring system, while non-selected thoughts (weak thoughts) are those that did not meet the required threshold. Unlike traditional methods, which focus primarily on the immediate next step, KPM makes this information available to all subsequent steps. For instance, thoughts selected or rejected during the easy step are accessible in both the intermediate and final steps. This comprehensive tracking ensures that the system retains a full understanding of the reasoning progression from start to finish.\nMathematically, let $S_{k}^{selected}$ and $S_{k}^{non-selected}$ represent the sets of selected and non-selected thoughts at level k, respectively. The KPM propagates these sets to all subsequent levels k + 1, k + 2, ..., as follows:\n${S_{k}^{selected}, S_{k}^{non-selected}} \\rightarrow {S_{k+1}^{selected}, S_{k+1}^{non-selected}..., S_{final}^{selected}, S_{final}^{non-selected}}$ (12)\nThis propagation includes maintaining a history of all thoughts and providing this history to the reasoning framework to ensure well-informed decision-making at each step. Additionally, the KPM includes a robust feedback mechanism. If no thought passes the threshold at any step, the module informs the main framework to regenerate thoughts, ensuring the reasoning process does not stall. This feedback mechanism is critical for maintaining the flow of reasoning and preventing bottlenecks:\nIf $S_{k}^{Sselected} = 0 \\Rightarrow$ Regenerate thoughts at level k (13)\nMoreover, the KPM handles various edge cases, such as those illustrated in Figure 3. It tracks thoughts that receive the same score and ensures appropriate handling. For instance, if multiple thoughts pass the threshold, the module informs the model of the scores for all passing thoughts, enabling it to prioritize them effectively. If two thoughts have identical scores, they"}, {"title": "If $S(t_{k1}) = S(t_{k2})$ and both $t_{k1}, t_{k2} \\in S_{selected} \\Rightarrow t_{k1}, t_{k2}$", "content": "(14)\nare given equal priority and propagated to the next step:\nIn cases where all thoughts pass the threshold, the module provides detailed scores to help the model utilize the thought information more effectively in subsequent steps. This systematic approach ensures that the reasoning process remains flexible and robust, capable of handling various scenarios without compromising the integrity of the reasoning flow. Compared to CoT, COT-SC, and Least2Most prompting, our KPM offers a more advanced and comprehensive approach to managing and propagating knowledge. Traditional methods primarily focus on sequential thought generation and consensus mechanisms without maintaining a detailed history of thoughts or providing robust feedback. Our KPM addresses these gaps by ensuring that all relevant information is available at every step, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and reliability of the reasoning process."}, {"title": "4. Experiments", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the RDoLT, we conducted a comprehensive series of experiments.

[2024], Gemma-2(9B)Team [2024], and Gemma-2(27B)Team [2024]. Although we also utilized the OpenAI API to access ChatGPT-40OpenAI [2024], our primary focus was on evaluating the performance of open-source LLMs with various quantization levels. This focus allowed us to conduct extensive experiments and explore different variations in prompt design.\nIn our experiments, we maintained the temperature parameter at 0.4, striking a balance between encouraging model creativity and ensuring consistent, reliable responses for complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, the context length was set at 8192 tokens to maximize the model's ability to handle extensive input sequences. We also explored context lengths of 4096 and 2056 tokens to evaluate the impact on model performance and accuracy.\nThe RDOLT framework is specifically designed to address reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring sequential and multi-step reasoning. To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we tested it against well-known benchmarks that push the limits of prompt engineering. For mathematical reasoning, we deployed the GSMK8 Cobbe et al. [2021], Multi-Arithmetic ChilleD [2023b], SVAMP Patel et al. [2021] and Gaokao 2023 Math Zhang et al. [2023b] benchmarks.

The single-step (sequential) variant demonstrated the highest overall performance, peaking at 80.78% with a threshold of > 35. This superior performance suggests that for complex tasks, allowing more extensive processing before making decisions yields better results. The sequential nature of this variant likely enables a more thorough exploration of the problem space, leading to more accurate solutions. Multi-Step (1-Shot) and Few-Shots (2) variants showed optimal performance at thresholds of \u2265 35 (77.51%) and \u2265 35 (77.15%), respectively. These results indicate that these approaches benefit from moderate thresholds, striking a balance between depth of processing and efficiency. The slightly lower performance compared to the Single-Step variant might be attributed to the trade-off between speed and accuracy, where these methods attempt to reach solutions more quickly but potentially at the cost of some precision.\nInterestingly, One-Shot variant achieved its best performance (71.73%) at a lower threshold of \u226530. This suggests that this approach is more suitable for tasks requiring quicker decision-making or where rapid responses are valued over absolute accuracy. The lower overall performance compared to other variants implies while efficient, this method may sacrifice some problem-solving depth. Multi-Request variants, both limited (3) and unlimited, performed optimally at the > 30 threshold, with scores of 73.24% and 74.51% respectively. This pattern indicates that allowing multiple attempts at problem-solving can be effective, but excessive iterations may not yield significant improvements. The similarity in performance between the limited and unlimited variants suggests that there might be a natural ceiling to the benefits of multiple attempts, beyond which additional requests do not substantially enhance outcomes.\nA noteworthy trend across all variants is the reduced performance at the highest threshold (\u2265 40). This consistent drop-off points to a potential over-processing effect, where excessively high thresholds may introduce unnecessary complexity or lead to over-fitting in the decision-making process.

First, the generalizability of RDOLT to domain-specific tasks has not been fully explored. The framework shows promising results in standard reasoning tasks, but its adaptability to highly specialized domains such as legal reasoning or medical diagnostics may require further fine-tuning and optimization. Additionally, the computational overhead of maintaining the Knowledge Propagation Module (KPM) may limit scalability, particularly in resource-constrained environments.\nAnother potential threat to validity is the reliance on benchmark datasets that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world reasoning scenarios. Although benchmarks like GSM8K and SVAMP are widely used, they represent structured tasks that may not account for the diverse and dynamic nature of human reasoning in more unstructured settings.\nFuture research should focus on addressing these limitations by extending the framework to more domain-specific applications and exploring optimizations that reduce computational costs. Additionally, incorporating more diverse and challenging real-world datasets could provide a deeper evaluation of RDoLT's capabilities.

When accuracy is evaluated as \"at least one correct pose in the ensemble\", RAPID-Net outperforms AlphaFold 3 on the PoseBusters benchmark, suggesting that our approach can be further improved with a suitable pose reweighting tool offering a cost-effective and competitive alternative to AlphaFold 3 for docking. Finally, using several therapeutically relevant examples, we demonstrate the ability of RAPID-Net to identify remote functional sites, highlighting its potential to facilitate the development of innovative therapeutics.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT", "content": "Molecular docking is the computational problem of predicting the most favorable ligand binding poses in a protein-ligand complex, given the experimentally determined or computer-simulated protein structure and the initial conformation of the ligand\u00b9. It plays a key role in drug development, typically following target identification when the biological molecule responsible for a disease is identified and validated as a therapeutic target2. Once the target is identified, molecular docking is used for structure-based drug discovery and development 3;4 to identify and optimize potential lead compounds5;6. The docking results can guide virtual screening workflows, enabling the selection of promising candidates from vast chemical libraries 7;8. This process helps to determine whether a compound has potential for drug development. By significantly improving the speed and efficiency of early drug discovery, molecular docking reduces the time and costs associated with the development of new therapeutics 10.\nTypical protein-ligand docking pipelines rely on users specifying the binding pocket, and docking programs such as AutoDock Vina 11;12, GOLD13, and Glide14, use grids to confine their search to known or hypothesized protein's interaction sites. However, in the absence of such information in \"blind\" or binding-site-agnostic settings \u2013 protein-ligand docking becomes significantly more difficult15, as the docking algorithm must scan the entire protein surface, dramatically increasing the computational complexity. Traditional blind docking methods often rely on extensive sampling to explore potential binding sites across the whole protein, but this approach is computationally and time-intensive, making it impractical for large-scale virtual screening tasks 16;17.\nWith the advent of advanced protein structure prediction methods 18-including AlphaFold19, ColabFold20, OpenFold21, and RosettaFold22-the number of generated protein structures has surged, often without any corresponding ligand information. Meanwhile, only about ~ 5% of human coding genes currently serve as commercial drug targets, leaving a vast array of disease-related targets unexplored 23. Despite this immense potential, most new drug research and development remains focused on a limited set of well-established targets, underscoring the urgent need for novel druggable targets 24.\nAs more proteins lacking known binding pocket information are considered in drug discovery 25, the demand for ligand docking approaches that do not rely on prior knowledge of the binding site has grown significantly, highlighting the necessity for binding-site-agnostic methods.\nAt the same time, many existing protein binding site identification algorithms are evaluated primarily on the geometric properties of their predicted pockets26, rather than on how accurately they guide subsequent ligand docking. In this work, our primary objective is to develop a pocket-finding algorithm that can be readily integrated with standard docking software and provide accurate, efficient guidance in binding-site-agnostic settings. We evaluate its performance both in terms of docking accuracy-using AutoDock Vina 1.2.512-and the geometric characteristics of the generated pockets.\nIn terms of underlying pocket prediction function, existing algorithms can be broadly classified into classical and Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches 26. Classical methods rely on expert-defined rules or heuristics to detect pockets, whereas"}, {"title": "II. DESIGN RATIONALE BEHIND OUR MODEL", "content": "When predicting likely binding pockets, there is a well-known trade-off between precision and recall. A recent evaluation of pocket prediction methods based on the geometrical properties of their predicted pockets26 highlights this trade-off. Currently available ML methods such as VN-EGNN35, GrASP36, and PUResNet37 achieve high precision (over 90%), but they systematically predict a small number of pockets, leading to low recall. As 26 points out, generating multiple predictions, some of which may be false positives, is often more useful than potentially missing viable binding sites.\nTo address this shortcoming and mitigate low recall, we develop RAPID-Net as an ensemble-based model to improve the stability of prediction accuracy and coverage of potential binding sites. RAPID-Net consists of five independently trained model replicas to aggregate results and increase the reliability of its predictions. For subsequent docking, RAPID-Net returns two types of pockets:\n1) Majority-voted pockets: Consisting of voxels predicted by at least 3 out of 5 ensemble models, for high-confidence predictions.\n2) Minority-reported pockets: Consisting of voxels predicted by at least 1 out of 5 ensemble models, increasing the overall recall.\nAs demonstrated on diverse benchmark datasets in the following Sections, including PoseBusters28, Astex Diverse Set 29, Coach42030, and BU4831, the proposed ensemble-based approach yields more stable and reliable performance compared to current ML-driven pocket predictors, both considering the majority-voted and minority-reported pockets.\nFor instance, consider the 8DP2 protein from the Pose-Busters 28 dataset, illustrated in Fig. 2. RAPID-Net predicts two majority-voted sub-pockets connected by a link. However, because no ligand binding occurs in one of these sub-pockets, it constitutes a false positive. By contrast, one of the subleading poses binds within the second predicted sub-pocket and passes all tests. This example demonstrates RAPID-Net's ability to balance accuracy and recall, providing a comprehensive and robust pocket prediction framework for complex docking tasks. Furthermore, as shown in the following Sections, the minority-reported pockets predicted by our model are often shallow pockets corresponding to secondary binding sites, in contrast to the more prominent majority-voted pockets.\nOn the other hand, FPocket 32 typically predicts many, often overlapping alpha-spheres, making it difficult or even impossible to segment the protein surface clearly. FPocket 32 can place alpha spheres in adjacent but distinct pockets, introducing ambiguity in the definition of distinct docking regions. As an illustration, for the ABHD5 protein structure obtained from AlphaFold19 shown in Fig. 1, the majority-voted pocket predicted by our model forms a compact clearly defined region. If FPocket32 was used in the docking pipeline instead, nearly the entire protein surface would need to be included, drastically increasing computational costs.\nThe drawbacks of overly large search grids can be illustrated by the 8F4J protein structure from the PoseBusters 28 (PB) dataset"}, {"title": "III. MODEL TRAINING AND INFERENCE PIPELINE", "content": "We trained our model using the sc-PDB49 dataset, which contains protein structures with annotated binding sites. In this dataset, cavities are defined using VolSite 50, which maps the pharmacophore properties of nearby protein atoms onto a three-dimensional grid. This method assumes that ligand-induced conformational changes remain relatively small51, treating each cavity atom as a \"pseudoatom\" to denote an interaction point rather than a physical atom.\nFollowing 37, we used a curated subset of sc-PDB 49 in which redundant protein structures were filtered out based on their Tanimoto index 52. Each protein structure was then placed in a 36 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 36 grid, with each voxel corresponding to a 2\u00c5 \u00d7 2\u00c5 \u00d7 2\u00c5 unit cell. We extracted 18 features per voxel using the tfbio53 package to provide a representation of the protein environment for the model training.\nIn contrast to previous studies, we apply the medical image segmentation practices54;55;56 to perform soft segmentation of ligand-binding pockets, rather than treating it as a strict binary classification problem. In Kalasanty38 and PUResNet37, each voxel is considered part of a binding pocket if it contains at least one cavity pseudoatom. The number of pseudoatoms per voxel is then clipped to the range [0,1], and the model is trained with a Dice loss function as part of a binary classification task:\n\\Delta_{\\text{Dice}}\\left(V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{clipped}}, V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{clipped}}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2 \\cdot V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{clipped}} \\cap V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{clipped}}}{V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{clipped}} + V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{clipped}}} \\qquad (1)\nwhere $V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{clipped}}$ and $V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{clipped}}$ represent the binary masks of the true and predicted pockets, respectively, indicates their intersection, and $V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{clipped}}$ and $V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{clipped}}$ denote the number of occupied voxels in the true and predicted masks, respectively.\nRecently, PUResNet V234 sought to improve performance by replacing the Dice loss function with a focal loss57. However, our extensive experiments indicate that adopting a \u201csoft\u201d approach 54;55;56 is better suited in this context. In contrast to the binary \"yes/no\u201d classification of occupied voxels, the density of pseudoatoms serves as an indicator of the proximity of a voxel to the interior or boundary of a pocket. Higher densities typically occur near polar or charged residues and ligand functional groups, whereas lower densities are often associated with hydrophobic regions.\nDrawing inspiration from medical image segmentation methods 54;55;56, we replace the sigmoid output in the final layer with a ReLU58 (hence the name of our model, ReLU Activated Pocket Identification for Docking, RAPID-Net):\n$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \\rightarrow \\text{ReLU}(x) = \\text{max}(0,x) \\qquad (2)$\nFor the model training, we also replace the conventional Dice loss in Eq. 1 with its \"soft\" variant:\n$\\Delta_{\\text{soft Dice}, L_2}\\left(V_{\\text{true}}, V_{\\text{predicted}}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{2 \\sqrt{\\text{Grid}}\\left(V_{\\text{true}} \\cdot V_{\\text{predicted}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{V_{\\text{true}}^{\\text{Grid}}} + \\sqrt{V_{\\text{predicted}}^{\\text{Grid}}}} \\qquad (3)$\nSeveral ways of implementing the \u201csoft\u201d Dice loss have been proposed55;56, but we found that this simplest version, based on the L2 norm, works best.\nTo mitigate class imbalance, as the number of non-interacting voxels sharply exceeds the number of interacting ones, we applied class reweighting using scikit-learn59. During inference, a voxel is classified as part of a binding pocket if the model output exceeds threshold = 0.5. When ensembling five models, we apply morphological closing using the binary_closing function from the scipy.ndimage package 60 to mitigate sparsity in the predicted pocket regions across model replicas.\nUnlike previous approaches that use cavity6.mol2 labels 37;38, we train our model with threshold-less pocket labels (cavityALL.mol2). In cavity6.mo12, annotations are restricted to regions within 6.5\u00c5 of the ligand's heavy atoms 49, potentially overlooking distal functional regions such as allosteric pockets, exosites, or flexible loops. These sites can critically influence drug binding and resistance, making them key therapeutic targets. Secondary binding sites, which often lie beyond the 6.5 \u00c5 boundary, mediate interactions with larger substrates or cofactors and help position them within the catalytic pocket, as further discussed in Section IX.\nBy adopting threshold-less labels, our model identifies both catalytic and more distant sites, thereby improving predictions for proteins that contain such secondary binding regions. This approach also makes the Distance Center Center (DCC) metric, which was previously used to evaluate Kalasanty 38 and PUResNet37, less relevant. DCC defines the distance between the geometrical center of the predicted pocket and the true ligand binding pose, but \"tunnels\" can extend from the primary binding pocket to distal residues that lie far from the ligand but have significant therapeutic implications (see Section IX for examples). Furthermore, the threshold-less pocket definition is less sensitive to the ligand size, thereby improving the generalizability of our model."}, {"title": "IV. DOCKING PROTOCOL AND ITS RATIONALE", "content": "For each predicted pocket, we define the center of the search grid as the average of the maximum and minimum x, y, and z coordinates of all pseudoatoms in the pocket:\n$\\text{center} (x, y, z) = \\frac{\\text{max} (x, y, z) + \\text{min} (x, y, z)}{2}, \\qquad (4)$\nwhere max (x, y, z) and min (x, y, z) are the maximum and minimum coordinates, respectively. The grid dimensions are then given by:\n$\\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\Delta z = (\\text{max} (x, y, z) - \\text{min} (x, y, z)) + 2 \\cdot \\text{threshold} \\qquad (5)$\nFig. 5 illustrates this setup for the majority-voted pocket in the ABHD5 protein with a threshold value of 2 \u00c5.\nFor each majority-voted pocket, we generate search grids with thresholds of 2\u00c5 and 5\u00c5. For minority-reported pockets, we use thresholds of 2\u00c5, 5\u00c5, 10\u00c5, and 15\u00c5. This strategy accounts for large ligands, such as those in the PoseBusters 28 dataset, which may extend beyond the predicted pockets, and also reduces potential inaccuracies in our model's pocket predictions."}, {"title": "V. TEST BENCHMARKS AND EVALUATION METRICS", "content": "We evaluate docking performance as the percentage of Top-1 Vina poses with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) below 2 \u00c5 between the predicted and one of the true ligand poses if multiple true poses are available. RMSD is calculated as:\n$\\text{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ||r_{\\text{true}}^i - r_{\\text{pred}}^i||^2}, \\qquad (6)$\nwhere N is the number of ligand atoms, $r_{\\text{true}}^i$ and $r_{\\text{pred}}^i$ are positions of the i-th atom in the true and predicted poses, respectively, and $||\\cdot||$ is the Euclidean norm. RMSD is computed using the CalcRMS function in RDKit 61.\nDocking methods like AutoDock Vina12 balance speed and accuracy 62, utilizing \u201cfast and dirty\" scoring functions. A common strategy to enhance their accuracy is to generate an ensemble of potential poses and then identify the best pose among them using more accurate scoring tools, for example63;64. Fast scoring functions enable the efficient exploration of numerous poses, while more accurate methods are reserved for refinement and final pose selection. To account for this approach, we also compute the ensemble RMSD accuracy as \"at least one pose in the ensemble is correct\u201d, highlighting the potential gains from precise rescoring. Since our primary focus is on improving pocket identification rather than developing new rescoring functions, we defer such work to the future. Our goal here is to illustrate the potential of our method when combined with an appropriate rescoring tool.\nAdditionally, we evaluate the PB-success rate, defined as the percentage of poses with RMSD < 2\u00c5 that pass all 26/26 chemical validity checks defined by PoseBusters 28.\nFinally, similarly to37, we compute the Pocket-Ligand Intersection (PLI) score to quantify the proportion of ligand atoms residing within the predicted pocket. Unlike37, which computes a voxel-based intersection, we measure the average fraction of ligand heavy atoms located within 5 \u00c5 of at least one pocket pseudoatom, yielding a more intuitive metric:\n$\\text{PLI} = \\frac{N_{\\text{within 5 \u00c5}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}, \\qquad (7)$\nwhere $N_{\\text{within 5 \u00c5}}$ is the number of ligand heavy atoms within 5 \u00c5 of any pocket pseudoatom, and $N_{\\text{total}}$ is the total number of heavy atoms in the ligand.\""}, {"title": "VI. EVALUATION ON THE POSEBUSTERS DATASET", "content": "We obtained the following results by docking on the Pose-Busters 28 dataset using the aforementioned protocol. Fig. 7 shows the percentage of predictions with RMSD < 2\u00c5 and the corresponding PB-success rates. When guided by the ensembled RAPID-Net, AutoDock Vina 12 achieved 55.8% RMSD-correct predictions and a 54.9% PB-success rate, outperforming DiffBindFR43, which scored 50.2% and 49.1%, respectively. This result highlights the crucial impact of accurate pocket identification on the subsequent docking accuracy. Our approach uses targeted docking with the widely used AutoDock Vina 12, whereas DiffBindFR 43 scans the entire protein surface.\nFurthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, docking driven by individual RAPID-Net models-the ensemble components-outperforms PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38 in docking accuracy. Ensembling RAPID-Net models further improves docking accuracy by providing more stable results. The distribution of RMSD values for the Top-1 predicted Vina poses is shown in Fig. 8.\nNote the issue of low recall discussed above. While the RAPID-Net ensemble predicts pockets in all 308 structures, PUResNet 37 and Kalasanty 38 predict pockets in only 278 and 263 protein structures, respectively. Since we evaluate accuracy in \"blind\" docking settings, cases with no predicted pockets are treated as failures by default.\nNot all predicted pockets are positioned correctly. Of the 308 structures where RAPID-Net predicts at least one pocket, 307 contain at least one true ligand binding pose entirely within a search grid, meaning that docking can be successful in 307 out of 308 cases. In the remaining case, docking would inevitably fail due to an inaccurate search grid location. By contrast, PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38 have only 265 and 249 structures, respectively, where at least one true ligand pose is located completely within the search grid. This demonstrates that our model not only accurately identifies pockets in favorable protein structures but also provides reliable predictions across the entire dataset.\nFor the 8BTI protein structure illustrated in Fig. 10, the Top-1 Vina pose fails, but one of the subleading poses passes all tests. In contrast, for the 7XFA protein structure shown in Fig.11, neither the Top-1 nor any of the subleading Vina poses satisfy the RMSD test, with the closest pose in the ensemble having RMSD = 4.36\u00c5. This occurs even though the majority-voted pocket predicted by our model covers most of the true ligand binding pose with PLI = 83%.\nSimilarly to the 8BTI structure shown in Fig. 10, surprisingly many protein structures have a pattern when the Top-1 Vina pose fails the RMSD test, but one of the subleading poses passes it. As shown in Fig. 12, when evaluating RMSD as \"at least one pose among the ensemble is correct\", AutoDock Vina 12 actually outperforms AlphaFold 333 with the pocket specified, achieving 93.8% versus 93.2% RMSD < 2\u00c5 accuracy rate. This difference becomes even more pronounced in the \u201cblind\u201d docking settings, where AutoDock Vina 12, guided by the ensemble of RAPID-Net models, results in a 92.2% RMSD < 2\u00c5 success rate compared to 80.5% for AlphaFold 333. Furthermore, RAPID-Net performs better than PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38 in guiding AutoDock Vina 12, as can be observed in Fig. 12.\nTo illustrate the extent of Vina's limitations in pose ranking, Fig. 13 shows the distribution of ranks for subleading poses"}, {"title": "VII. EVALUATION ON THE ASTEX DIVERSE SET", "content": "The docking results of AutoDock Vina 12 guided by different pocket-finding algorithms for the Astex Diverse Set29, consisting of 85 protein structures, are shown in Fig. 20. The corresponding RMSD distribution of the Top-1 predicted Vina poses is presented in Fig. 21, and the associated PLI scores are shown in Fig. 22.\nSeveral striking features emerge from these graphs. First, although each individual Run of our model outperforms the docking accuracy achieved when guiding AutoDock Vina 12 using PUResNet 37 or Kalasanty 38, ensembling these individual Runs does not improve the overall docking accuracy. This happens even though the ensembled version of RAPID-Net achieves a higher ligand-pocket intersection, as shown in Fig. 22 and Table II.\nFurthermore, unlike the PoseBusters 28 dataset, when AutoDock Vina 12 is guided by Kalasanty 38 on the Astex Diverse Set29, it achieves better docking accuracy than when guided by PUResNet37, even though PUResNet37 has more structures with at least one true ligand binding pose completely within the search grid (72 vs. 70, respectively).\nNevertheless, when considering ensemble accuracy-achieved either by the Top-1 pose or any subleading pose, as illustrated in Fig. 23\u2013the ensembled version of RAPID-Net outperforms each of its individual Runs: 95.3% versus 92.9%, 87.1%, 89.4%, 90.6%, and 91.8%, respectively. Additionally, PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38 both achieve the same ensemble accuracy of 78.8%. Fig. 25 shows the distribution of subleading poses' ranks passing the RMSD tests when the Top-1 Vina pose fails"}, {"title": "VIII. EVALUATION ON COACH420 AND BU48 DATASETS", "content": "For direct comparison with Kalasanty 38 and PUResNet 37, we evaluate the corresponding PLI rates on the Coach42030 and BU4831 datasets. Following37, we exclude protein structures present in the training sets, resulting in 298 and 62 protein-ligand structures for Coach42030 and BU4831, respectively.\nUnlike the original PUResNet37 paper where PLI values were evaluated only on protein structures where the distance-center-to-center (DCC) between predicted pocket centers and ligand centers was \u2264 4\u00c5, we report the results for all protein structures, over the whole dataset. This comparison seems more appropriate because a rough initial approximation to set up the search grid is often sufficient to achieve successful docking, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Furthermore, as discussed in the next Section, the RAPID-Net model sometimes predicts meaningful \"tunnels\" or \"bridges\" to distant binding sites that indirectly influence ligand binding. In such cases, the DCC metric becomes irrelevant since it does not reflect the functional importance of these remote interactions.\nTable III and Fig. 27 summarize the results for the Coach420 dataset 30. Except for Run 3, every RAPID-Net run surpasses PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38 in terms of an average PLI score. Furthermore, when comparing the number of protein structures in which at least one true ligand binding pose is entirely within the search grid, up to the largest grid with a threshold of 15 \u00c5, all RAPID-Net Runs outperform both PUResNet37 and Kalasanty 38. Similarly, Table IV and Fig. 28 present the results for the BU48 dataset31. Here, all RAPID-Net Runs, except Run 5, outperform both Kalasanty and PUResNet in terms of an average PLI and the number of protein structures where at least one true ligand binding pose is completely contained within the search grids.\nDifferent RAPID-Net Runs have varying performances across the four test datasets, reflecting the inherent element of randomness in the model training. For example, on the PoseBusters 28 dataset, Run 2 has the fewest protein structures with viable predicted search grids, as shown in Table I. In contrast, Run 3 produces the fewest viable grids for the Astex Diverse Set29 and Coach42030, as shown in Tables II and III, while Run 5 shows the lowest PLI for BU4831, as shown in Table IV. Notably, despite having lower coverage on Coach42030 and BU4831, Run 5 achieves the highest \u201cat least one correct pose in the ensemble\u201d rate on PoseBusters 28, as shown in Figure 12."}, {"title": "IX. IDENTIFICATION OF ALLOSTERIC SITES, EXOSITES, AND FLEXIBLE REGIONS FOR DRUG DESIGN", "content": "To illustrate RAPID-Net's ability to identify remote sites of therapeutic interest, we consider four proteins where such sites are well documented.\nThrombin (RCSB PDB: 1DWC) The RCSB PDB entry 1DWC65 is the crystal structure of human a-thrombin in complex with the inhibitor MD-805. Thrombin plays a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade and is therefore a key target in treating acute coronary syndromes66. As shown in Fig. 29, Kalasanty 38 and PUResNet37 predict binding pockets largely surrounding the ligand. By contrast, our model, RAPID-Net, detects an additional bulge extending towards residues 71, 73, 75, 76, and 77. These residues belong to the anion-binding Exosite I, which interacts with negatively charged substrates and cofactors such as fibrinogen, thrombomodulin, and COOH-terminal peptide of hirudin 67;68;69;70;71. Our model's prediction, a \"tunnel\u201d connecting the active site to the Exosite I in Fig. 29, suggests possible long-range interactions, consistent with previous studies of long-range allosteric communication in thrombin 71.\nHuman Carbonic Anhydrase I (RCSB PDB: 1AZM) and II (RCSB PDB: 3HS4) Human carbonic anhydrase I (hCAI) in complex with a sulfonamide drug (PDB: 1AZM)72 and hCAII in complex with acetazolamide (AZM) (PDB: 3HS4)73 are key targets for glaucoma treatment74 and diuretic therapy 75, with broader potential for treating obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease 75. In both isoforms, His64 acts as the primary proton shuttle 76;77;78\nAs shown in Fig. 30a, while PUResNet V137 and Kalasanty 38 predict the primary ligand binding region in 1AZM, our model additionally predicts a hook-shaped bulge wrapping around His64, suggesting an allosteric interaction.\nIn hCAII (3HS4), a histidine cluster (His3, His4, His10, His15, His17, His64) mediates proton exchange between the active site and the environment75. Notably, 3HS4 contains two additional AZM molecules in shallow surface pockets-one previously identified79;80 and another in a novel binding site 73.\nAs shown in Fig. 30b, RAPID-Net identifies two majority-voted pockets: one around the catalytic site and another one near the histidine cluster. As shown in Fig. 30c, the minority-reported pockets predicted by our model have PLI = 92% with these secondary binding poses in shallow pockets. This highlights the ability of our model to predict all binding sites in the protein, both primary and secondary.\nIn comparison, for this protein structure, Kalasanty 38 predicts only the main binding site, PUResNet V137 detects none, and PUResNet V234 identifies only the interacting residues within the main binding site.\nLs-AChBP (RCSB PDB: 2ZJV). RCSB PDB ID 2ZJV81 represents Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) bound to neonicotinoid clothianidin. AChBP serves as a model for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and their allosteric transitions82, providing insights into therapies for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and tobacco addiction 83;84;85.\nFor the 2ZJV protein structure, neither Kalasanty 38 nor PUResNet V137 predict any pockets. However, the majority-voted pockets from our model and the interacting residues of PUResNet V234 illustrated in Fig. 31 are predicted around all five true ligand binding positions.\nFurthermore, our model's pockets include distinct bridges toward residues Thr155-Asp160 in the flexible F-loop, suggesting indirect ligand interactions. This finding aligns with the results from81, who highlighted that induced-fit movements of loop regions, including the F-loop, are essential for ligand recognition by neonicotinoids.\nThese examples demonstrate our model's capability to identify regions influencing ligand binding-even without direct ligand contact. By revealing distal regions such as Exosite I in thrombin, His64 in hCA, and remote loop segments in Ls-AChBP, our approach provides key structural insights that can drive allosteric inhibitor design and broader therapeutic innovation."}, {"title": "X. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "As the number of protein structures without known binding sites continues to grow, performing binding-site-agnostic (or \"blind\") docking has become crucial for structure-guided drug design. Successful blind docking relies heavily on accurately identifying the search grid where the ligand is likely to bind. However, most existing pocket prediction tools operate irrespectively of docking pipelines and are evaluated using metrics that do not directly correlate with docking success. To address this gap, we developed RAPID-Net, an ML-based pocket identification tool specifically designed for seamless integration with docking pipelines. We tested RAPID-Net's effectiveness in guiding blind docking using AutoDock Vina 1.2.512, but our approach can be easily adapted to any docking software that requires a well-defined search grid.\nWhen guided by RAPID-Net, AutoDock Vina 12 outperforms DiffBindFR43 by over 5% in blind docking accuracy on the PoseBusters 28 dataset, highlighting the direct relationship between improved pocket identification and increased docking accuracy. Furthermore, RAPID-Net provides precise and compact search grids, enabling the docking of ligands to large proteins such as 8F4J from the PoseBusters28 dataset, which tools like AlphaFold 333 cannot process in whole, highlighting the critical importance of accurate and focused search areas for effective docking.\nWe found that another major factor limiting docking accuracy is the proper reranking of generated poses. Notably, when assessing accuracy based on whether at least one pose in the ensemble is correct (instead of only the top-ranked pose), AutoDock Vina 12 surpasses AlphaFold 333 in accuracy on PoseBusters 28 dataset. This advantage becomes even more significant in blind docking scenarios. With RAPID-Net's guidance, AutoDock Vina 1.2.512 exceeds AlphaFold 3's performance by over 10% on the PoseBusters 28 dataset. These findings suggest that, in addition to precise pocket identification, developing improved reranking tools could further enhance the docking accuracy of our combined scheme by effectively selecting the most favorable poses from those generated.\nWe attribute the success of RAPID-Net to the following key changes and innovations we introduced:\n\u2022 Soft Labeling and ReLU Activation: Unlike conventional binary segmentation tasks, we applied soft labels and ReLU activation in the output layer, drawing inspiration from medical image segmentation techniques. This approach enables the model to more effectively differentiate between the internal regions of pockets and their boundaries.\n\u2022 Attention Mechanism: We integrated a single attention block within the encoder-decoder bottleneck, enhancing the model's ability to focus on relevant features while reducing the risk of overfit in inherently noisy data environments.\n\u2022 Simplified Architecture: By eliminating excessive residual connections, we streamlined the model architecture, resulting in improved performance. This simplification was effective given the noisy nature of the dataset.\nFinally, our model demonstrated the ability to identify \"bridges\" to distal sites located more than 6.5 \u00c5 away from the ligand binding site, which are crucial for therapeutic applications, making RAPID-Net a promising tool for uncovering such areas and providing valuable insights for broader therapeutic strategies.\nIn summary, RAPID-Net not only improves the accuracy of pocket identification and subsequent docking but also opens new avenues for targeting remote therapeutic sites, highlighting its potential in the field of computational drug discovery."}]}

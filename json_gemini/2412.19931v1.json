{"title": "Pivoting B2B platform business models: From platform experimentation to multi-platform integration to ecosystem envelopment", "authors": ["Clara Filosa", "Marin Jovanovic", "Lara Agostini", "Anna Nosella"], "abstract": "The landscape of digital servitization in the manufacturing sector is evolving, marked by a strategic shift from traditional product-centric to platform business models (BMs). Manufacturing firms often employ a blend of approaches to develop business-to-business (B2B) platforms, leading to significant reconfigurations in their BMs. However, they frequently encounter failures in their B2B platform development initiatives, leading them to abandon initial efforts and pivot to alternative platform strategies. Therefore, this study, through an in-depth case study of a manufacturer in the energy sector, articulates a three-phase pivoting framework for B2B platform BMs, including platform development and platform strategy. Initially, the manufacturer focused on asset-based product sales supplemented by asset maintenance services and followed an emergent platformization strategy characterized by the rise of multiple, independent B2B platforms catering to diverse functions. Next, focusing on the imposed customer journey strategy, the firm shifted towards a strategic multi-platform integration into an all-encompassing platform supported by artificial intelligence (AI), signaling a maturation of the platform BM to combine a wide range of services into an energy-performance-based contract. Finally, the last step of the firm's platform BM evolution consisted of a deliberate platform strategy open to external stakeholders and enveloping its data-driven offerings within a broader platform ecosystem. This article advances B2B platform BMs and digital servitization literature, highlighting the efficacy of a progressive approach and strategic pivoting.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The phenomenon of digital transformation is emerging as a new opportunity to stay competitive in the current economic scenario, marked by globalization, heightened competition, and frequent and substantial technological changes (e.g., AI) (Hanelt et al., 2021). In such a context, manufacturers are under constant pressure to innovate and adapt their business models (BMs) to the most cutting-edge trends (Cenamor et al., 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2022b; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2020), increasingly embracing the new digital servitization paradigm (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2019). Digital servitization refers to the creation of new or improvement of existing digital services, made smart by exploiting the potentialities of digital technologies for constantly collecting field data and monitoring product status, usage, and performance (Paschou et al., 2020). This new concept combines the potential of digitalization and servitization, through which manufacturers lay the foundations for new strategic opportunities, fundamentally altering their way of competing (Shen et al., 2023). Specifically, this dual focus enables companies to adopt both a customer- and service-centric lens using digital technologies and emphasizes customers' experience and engagement (Solem et al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2020; Vendrell-Herrero et al., 2017). Indeed, digital technologies are leveraged to gain knowledge about how customers use products, thus making manufacturers able to provide personalized solutions that fulfill specific demands and needs (Rymaszewska et al., 2017). By expanding and refining the scope of their new digital solution offerings, companies achieve closer and deeper engagement with customers, establishing long-term relationships (Dalenogare et al., 2023). Digital servitization, in turn, implies higher performance for firms in terms of competitiveness, economic sustainability, customer loyalty, and profitability (Markfort et al., 2021; Mart\u00edn-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2019).\nHowever, while extant research has focused on the economic aspects of digital servitization, several empirical studies highlight that traditional manufacturers struggle to concretely and successfully embrace this new economic paradigm and reap the benefits derived therefrom (Weking et al., 2020). Specifically, despite the growth of research in literature, there is still a dearth of theory development on the digital servitization journey that leverages B2B platform development (Cenamor et al., 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2022b; Saadatmand et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019). B2B platform development has proven to be an effective tool for enacting the digital servitization transformation (Eloranta et al., 2021). Adopting a platform approach entails an extension of relationships with external stakeholders (i.e., customers, suppliers, and partners) from a dyadic involvement to a multilateral ecosystem environment (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2020), and the development of an advanced platform architecture that enables aggregating various data types and formats and advancing AI platform service deployment (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2023). A manufacturing firm may choose to develop one or multiple types of B2B platforms, such as transaction, innovation, or hybrid platforms (Gawer, 2014). Yet, they all come with distinct managerial challenges. For example, developing transaction-driven B2B marketplaces (Lanzolla and Frankort, 2016; Wamba et al., 2008) may bring a different set of network effects in comparison to traditional B2C platforms (Thomas et al., 2024). Similarly, developing an industry-wide platform may require a distinct platform architecture (e.g., blockchain) and careful platform governance since the platform owner can also be a competitor (Jovanovic et al., 2022a). Finally, developing an innovation-driven or hybrid B2B platform ecosystem (Jovanovic et al., 2022b) with AI applications can be challenging to monetize, given the difficulty in inducing and developing complementors (Saadatmand et al., 2019), especially if the provider already has highly advanced performance-based contracts in place (Visnjic et al., 2017).\nThere is currently a lack of knowledge regarding how manufacturers strategize about and manage B2B platform development (Volberda et al., 2021), considering the supply-side and the demand-side of the platform market (Bonina et al., 2021). Previous studies on the topic highlight the necessity of a holistic transformation to successfully embrace digital transformation and the creation of a platform BM (Volberda et al., 2021), showing the different configurations a platform-based BM can assume (Ritala and Jovanovic, 2024). Furthermore, different studies analyze the role of the platform orchestrator (Shen et al., 2024), especially in the industrial markets (Van Dyck et al., 2024). However, detailed knowledge on how to practically implement this new meta-organizational form in terms of new routines, structures, and processes, is still limited (Kretschmer et al., 2022). It has not been thoroughly studied, specifically, how platform owners handle strategic challenges and opportunities (Ghazawneh and Henfridsson, 2011; Staykova, 2018), when switching from a product-centric to a platform ecosystem approach (Stonig et al., 2022; Van Dyck et al., 2024). For instance, emergent, imposed, and deliberate approaches (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985) to platform strategy have been less studied in the literature, specifically when advanced AI services are deployed (Bawack et al., 2022; Fosso Wamba et al., 2022).\nNext, B2B platform strategies are also directing new B2B platform BMs that alter the processes of value creation, value delivery and value capture mechanisms (Anderson et al., 2022; Ritala and Jovanovic, 2024; Tian et al., 2022). More importantly, with the promising rise of AI functionalities, there is a need to better understand how B2B platform BMs evolve, and how this leads to the redesign of manufacturers' activity systems as well as the orchestration mechanisms with external actors (e.g., customers and partners), with the goal of co-creating value (Ritala and Jovanovic, 2024; Shen et al., 2024). Therefore, the link between platform strategic response and the characteristics of B2B platform BMs remains understudied, representing an important area to explore (Van Dyck et al., 2024). Specifically, how manufacturers pivot from one B2B platform BM to another (Burnell et al., 2023; Shepherd et al., 2023; Snihur and Eisenhardt, 2022), resulting in platform portfolios (Tarzijan and Snihur, 2024) and multi-platform integration (Schreieck et al., 2024), is scarcely explored in the literature.\nFinally, little is known about how manufacturers pivot into platform ecosystems to generate value through complementor applications that support AI services (Clough and Wu, 2022) and envelop their data-driven offerings within broader platform ecosystems (Geurts and Cepa, 2023; Ritala et al., 2024).\nThe identified gaps highlight significant inadequacies in the existing literature, underscoring the need for theoretical development on key aspects of digital servitization to support and guide manufacturers in successfully navigating this transformative process. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to the discussion about the intersection of B2B platform development, B2B platform BMs, and associated platform strategies. Specifically, tackling the outlined gaps, we investigated the process of implementing advanced AI services. Accordingly, our study addresses the following research question:\nHow do incumbent manufacturing firms embrace different platform strategies and pivot their B2B platform BMs to provide AI services?\nTo address this question, we first reviewed the literature on digital servitization, AI, platform strategies, and B2B platform BM pivoting to build a solid theoretical background for our analysis. Next, we performed an in-depth qualitative single case study to describe the digital servitization process of an incumbent manufacturer in the energy sector. The analysis highlights the journey the case company has gone through in implementing AI services, closely examining the evolution of the company's platform strategies, value propositions, as well as the progression of platform development. We argue that the journey evolves over time through a progressive process, with phases that can be delineated. Specifically, the study theorizes on the evolution from platform experimentation to multi-platform integration to ecosystem envelopment, describing how the manufacturer adapts its platform strategy, platform development, and platform BM across the identified phases. Ultimately, this study proposes a pivoting framework that connects platform strategies and platform development, with platform BMs, showing how those elements and their intertwining evolve. By doing so, the article contributes to the literature by expanding the knowledge of digital servitization in relation to B2B platform development. This contributes to improving the discussion on the role of B2B platforms, specifically in the design and development of AI services. Moreover, the insights gathered through the in-depth case study allow us to understand how traditional manufacturers strategize about B2B platforms and pivot their platform BMs accordingly. The valuable understanding of those elements, along with the empirical knowledge derived from the case study investigation, support managers of traditional manufacturing firms in delineating the proper strategic planning and actions for a successful digital servitization transformation, thus also highlighting the managerial contribution of the article."}, {"title": "2. Theoretical background", "content": "The new paradigm of digital servitization derives from the interplay of the two phenomena that are affecting manufacturing businesses today: digitalization and servitization. Digitalization represents the process of transformation of procedures, operations, and offerings within companies by leveraging the potential of new and advanced digital technologies to enable product and service improvements, enhanced efficiency and effectiveness (Gebauer et al., 2021; Matthyssens, 2019; Taylor et al., 2020; Tronvoll et al., 2020). On the other hand, servitization consists of enriching companies' value propositions by complementing the offering of physical goods and basic services with advanced services (Visnjic et al., 2017; Weking et al., 2020), thus providing customers with integrated, personalized solutions that able to satisfy specific customer needs (Frank et al., 2019b; Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2019). The combination of digitalization and servitization leads to the innovative and advanced digital servitization concept, consisting of the transformation of processes, capabilities, and offerings to progressively create, deliver, and capture value through services based on enabling digital technologies (Shen et al., 2023). These digital technologies are leveraged to provide monitoring, optimization, and autonomous solutions, thus driving value for both providers and customers (Frank et al., 2019b; Paiola and Gebauer, 2020).\nIn this context, digitalization represents a driving force, and servitization is the output (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2022). A full-scale digital servitization is not possible without adequate data acquisition and analytics (Frank et al., 2019a; Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2020). Digital technologies are indeed adopted to connect products, resources, and people in a smart way (Porter and Heppelmann, 2015; Raff et al., 2020), collecting and generating a high volume and variety of data (Hsuan et al., 2021). Specifically, data from a large pool of customers, installed bases, infrastructures, and systems are stored, analyzed, and elaborated into meaningful insights (Jovanovic et al., 2022b). While operations for data collection and analysis can also be performed by human intervention, which can take a long time, digital technologies enable easier coding and classification of unstructured data from products, turning it into useable and user-friendly information (Rezazade Mehrizi et al., 2023; Subeesh and Mehta, 2021). By aiding the human effort, still required to check the proper operation of the technologies and algorithms underpinning the data analysis (Rezazade Mehrizi et al., 2023), this facilitates the development of a tailored value proposition to meet customers' needs in the most responsive and reliable way (Hasselblatt et al., 2018; Iriarte et al., 2023). Digital servitization also enhances the decision-making process by providing constantly updated field data and analytics about critical product parameters and status, and exploiting knowledge throughout the asset lifecycle (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2022). For example, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are used to accumulate massive data on physical products; cloud computing serves as data warehousing; big data and analytics render field insights into valuable information and predictive patterns that enable value-creating solutions (Grubic, 2018; Paiola and Gebauer, 2020; Suppatvech et al., 2019).\nDespite the strategic significance of digital servitization mentioned above, the role of cutting-edge technologies such as AI has still not been appropriately investigated (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2021; Thomson et al., 2023). AI is defined as \"a system's ability to interpret external data correctly, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation\" (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019). In practice, AI consists of algorithmic computer systems that may accomplish intricate tasks. These include data processing operations that enable the use of learning algorithms, the discovery of complex patterns in high-dimensional data, and the generation of output forecasts (Bauer et al., 2023; Jordan and Mitchell, 2015). Consequently, AI can be used in a wide range of scientific, business, and decision-making contexts (LeCun et al., 2015).\nIn the context of digital servitization, AI is exploited for its capability to accurately assess collected data, to elaborate on those inputs, to draw conclusions from them, and to apply those conclusions to particular activities and goals (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2021). Specifically, AI plays a crucial role in the evolution of cognitive cyber physical systems (CPS) by enabling autonomous decision-making processes where physical activities affect computations and vice versa (Radanliev et al., 2021). These characteristics of AI entail multiple functionalities (Hansen and B\u00f8gh, 2021). Among others, descriptive analytics techniques are used by AI algorithms to summarize insights and data collected through IoT sensors, presenting them as user-friendly information (Berente et al., 2021). Moreover, machine learning can be exploited for diagnostic purposes where the analytics are able to identify and classify association or causal relationships among events, for example, detecting the reasons behind a machine malfunction (Hansen and B\u00f8gh, 2021). Another case is the use of AI in offshore windmills, where AI can automatically cancel operations in case of high wind power to prevent damage. Hence, the integration of AI in CPS allows for the processing of high volume and variety of data (e.g., high search scope) and the solving of previously unexplored problems (Raisch and Fomina, 2024). This exemplifies AI prescriptive capability, which allows autonomous decision systems to help devices adjust to their environment (Hansen and B\u00f8gh, 2021). Finally, AI generates knowledge and lays the groundwork for automating processes (Raisch and Krakowski, 2021) by highlighting patterns that constitute the basis for the creation of new products and services (Berente et al., 2021; Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017). Therefore, by taking advantage of these AI features and functionalities, manufacturers can aim to offer advanced, innovative, and around-the-clock services like performance advisory, predictive maintenance, and autonomous solutions (Abou-Foul et al., 2023; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2021), which may also support circular economy (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2023). The early literature on autonomous solutions suggests that these services are highly context-dependent, making it essential to pilot smaller-scale trials to assess their feasibility before making full-scale investment decisions, a crucial step for implementing AI solutions in industrial settings (Thomson et al., 2023). In turn, AI solutions demand a high level of context understanding and entail significant investment costs, which may not be feasible if the solution is not replicable (Thomson et al., 2023). Therefore, strategic pivoting may accommodate these challenges by allowing firms to adjust their strategies based on initial trials and adapt their AI solutions to specific contexts."}, {"title": "2.2. Digital servitization strategic pivoting and business model reconfiguration", "content": "Digital servitization holds considerable significance for manufacturing firms, presenting an opportunity to differentiate themselves from competitors, cater to a broader spectrum of partners and customers, and tap into new market opportunities by reaching previously inaccessible markets and enhancing supply chain efficiency (Anderson et al., 2022; Cenamor et al., 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2022b; Shree et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2022). However, its practical implementation remains a formidable challenge for firms. This difficulty can be attributed to the inherent nature of digital servitization that, like any substantial organizational change, necessitates a strategic response (Autio, 2022; Van Dyck et al., 2024; Volberda et al., 2021) and disrupts the current BM (Martinez, 2022). This involves a comprehensive redefinition of the company's strategic objectives, encompassing the realignment of plans, activities, and targets to resonate with the newly adopted paradigm. As such, digital servitization represents a strategic pivot, defined as the transformation resulting from economic experimentation (Pillai et al., 2020; Gomes et al., 2021) and, hence, from the learning process that arises out of the introduction of a new technological or market paradigm (Grodal et al., 2015). As stated by Greenstein (2007, p.2), the deployment of the new strategic pivot \"leads to changes in business operations and organizational procedures that translate technological innovation into market value\", creating the opportunity for the introduction of a new product or service.\nThe concept of pivoting is extensively discussed in the entrepreneurship literature as a crucial mechanism during early-stage BM experimentation (Felin et al., 2020; Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2020). Pivoting involves strategic shifts to test new fundamental hypotheses about the product, strategy, and growth engine, which may entail significant changes to the BM, value proposition, target market, or technology (Shepherd and Gruber, 2021). Therefore, digital servitization pivoting requires a fundamental redesign of value creation, value delivery, and value capture mechanisms (Teece, 2010), demanding the formulation and implementation of novel managerial practices (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2022; Suppatvech et al., 2019). Yet, the BM reconfiguration seldom occurs in a singular, abrupt transformation; instead, it typically manifests as a gradual progression that invariably affects the BM dimensions (Schreieck et al., 2024). The economic experimentation initiated by digital servitization pivoting, in fact, is a learning process over time across multiple aspects, involving the whole firm's structure and its strategic and market position (Gomes et al., 2021; Pillai et al., 2020). Using the terminology provided by Grodal et al. (2015), a new opportunity like digital servitization disrupts the industry and individual firms' equilibrium, which is operationalized by the firm reconfiguring its fundamental BM dimensions: value creation, value capture, and value delivery (Shen et al., 2023; Rabetino et al., 2017).\nFirst, value creation is the development of an offering that is able to satisfy market demands and for which customers recognize value and utility (Teece, 2010; Sj\u00f6din et al., 2020). With the drastic shift towards digital servitization, value is mainly created by exploiting data constantly collected through digital technologies (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2022) that are leveraged to provide customers with the right solution that responds to their needs (Taylor et al., 2020) through performance and usage monitoring and optimization. Second, value delivery consists of the processes, activities, and means used to provide the defined value proposition to customers, thus identifying the way the business reaches the market (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2020; Teece, 2010). Digital services are often provided with the aid of technologies through which the company establishes a direct relationship with the customers and optimizes internal activities: technological support, in fact, enables firms to monitor products and information flows, adjusting the supply of offering according to the backend activities and resources and frontend requirements (Sj\u00f6din et al., 2020; Dalenogare et al., 2023). Finally, value capture represents the mechanisms through which a company can profit from its offerings, defining the proper cost structure and revenue model (Linde et al., 2023). Focusing on the cost structure, by exploiting digital technologies, manufacturers are able to take track of customers' needs and prioritize interventions based on field data collected in real time. By doing so, providers can allocate resources and develop client and product knowledge that can be used to improve the company's offering more effectively (Abou-foul et al., 2021; Linde et al., 2023). Hence, beyond the initial investment, digital servitization may enable significant cost efficiencies. Revenue stream mechanisms are also subject to reformulation: the provision of services allows firms to establish long-term relationships with customers for the entire physical product lifecycle, substituting one-shot transactions that characterize the selling of physical goods, and adopt a different pricing logic, obtaining recurring revenues with monthly or yearly fees paid to ensure the correct functioning of assets through well-designed digital services (Kohtam\u00e4ki et al., 2019).\nYet, many uncertainties still emerge about how digital servitization reconfigures BMs and how B2B platforms facilitate this transition (Frank et al., 2019a; Paiola and Gebauer, 2020), depending on the context in which firms operate, market characteristics, existing operations, and ways of doing business. This holds true especially for manufacturers whose B2B platforms are associated to the development of advanced services and solutions that profoundly alter their own value creation, value delivery, and value capture processes while also changing the activities of their customers (Iriarte et al., 2023). However, studies rarely adopt a process perspective in industrial contexts to support manufacturers in recognizing and overcoming these limitations (Jovanovic et al., 2022a, 2022b)."}, {"title": "2.3. The role of B2B platforms and B2B platform strategies", "content": "The relevance of B2B platforms in digital servitization is becoming increasingly pronounced (Anderson et al., 2022; Jovanovic et al., 2022b; Stonig et al., 2022; Van Dyck et al., 2024). The B2B platform serves as a pivotal cyber-physical hub for information and data exchange (Colombo et al., 2017), laying the groundwork for the development of diverse digital services (Cenamor et al., 2017) including AI-powered autonomous solutions (Thomson et al., 2023). Adopting a platform approach not only facilitates, but also actively generates new market opportunities (Cennamo, 2021). First, B2B transaction platforms connect buyers and sellers, streamline the purchasing process and reduce traditional market friction, thereby creating a more efficient marketplace that encourages broader participation from diverse, often global, partners and customers (Fan et al., 2023; Lanzolla and Frankort, 2016; Nambisan et al., 2019). Second, B2B platforms facilitate ecosystem creation, enabling complementary firms to collaborate and collectively develop innovative solutions, opening up new opportunities and leading to the emergence of entirely new market segments (Foss et al., 2023; Jacobides et al., 2018, 2024; Jacobides, 2022). Third, B2B platforms enhance data transparency by prioritizing standardized data sharing and aggregation (Agrawal et al., 2019; Berente et al., 2021), which builds trust among participants, facilitates better decision making via effective governance mechanisms (Autio, 2022; Shen et al., 2024), as well as monetizing data (Ritala et al., 2024). Finally, as more participants join the B2B platform, its value increases due to network effects, attracting additional users and partners, further expanding the market, and creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth (Chen et al., 2022; Rietveld and Schilling, 2021).\nTherefore, on the one hand, the B2B platforms, both transaction-based and innovation-based (Gawer, 2014; Gawer and Cusumano, 2014), foster a more profound relationship between the firm and its customers and partners. This is achieved not only by analyzing transaction data or product data in the field, but also, and most importantly, by actively involving customers and partners in designing the most suitable digital services and solutions to meet their specific needs. Consequently, customers and partners become integral participants in the co-creation process of digital services and solutions (Dalenogare et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2022).\nOn the other hand, the data sharing mechanism on which the functioning of a B2B platform is based also raises challenges in terms of privacy, security, trust, ethics, data ownership, and governance (Agrawal et al., 2019; Berente et al., 2021). When a serious risk of important information being leaked or misused is perceived, with consequent damage to competitive advantage, stakeholders could withdraw from the platform (Berente et al., 2021; Jovanovic et al., 2022a). Hence, setting rules, not only for the operation of the algorithms that elaborate products data into meaningful information and predictions, but also for properly handling the governance mechanisms among the stakeholders involved, becomes fundamental (Agrawal et al., 2019). For example, ensuring that multiple users have access only to pertinent information for their duties and guaranteeing and boosting the necessary dialogue between front-end and back-end functions distributed across several actors, help in defining roles and distributing the needed activities for a successful commercialization of advanced digital services and solutions (Cenamor et al., 2017).\nGiven the potentialities, advantages, and issues posed by the introduction of a B2B platform, selecting an appropriate platform strategy becomes essential. The formation of a platform strategy can be analyzed according to the theoretical lens provided by Mintzberg and Waters (1985) who identify three distinct strategic paradigms: emergent, deliberate, and imposed strategies (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985). Emergent strategies are characterized by patterned actions that are not the result of explicit intentions set by senior management, while deliberate strategies are closely aligned with the organization's articulated intentions. In contrast, imposed strategies originate from external sources, particularly customer influence, which directly shapes the company actions. This last paradigm represents a hybrid form, where the realized strategy merges the firm's objectives with external customer pressures to ensure competitive success. These three paradigms may succeed each other, reflecting the learning process established by the experimentation of a strategic reorientation: using the terminology provided by Grodal et al. (2015), when a new opportunity as digital servitization disrupts the industry and individual firms' equilibrium, this creates a strategic reorientation, characterized by an initial divergence and a subsequent convergence. The initial disruption characterized by uncertainty and experiments proceeds through improvements and selection, taking into account internal adjustments and, most of all, market feedback, which ultimately translates into a mature and more structured development of the realized strategy (Grodal et al., 2015).\nIn the context of B2B platform pivoting, a firm strategically changes its focus from one paradigm to another (Schreieck et al., 2024). For example, this strategic reorientation often involves transitioning from a"}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "Given the exploratory nature of our study and the goal of illustrating the range of platform strategies, events, dynamics, and challenges the digital servitization transition presents to manufacturers, we adopted an inductive research method based on a comprehensive single qualitative case study. This approach is well suited for the study because it enables the investigation of new and transformational phenomena and their real-world applications (Yin, 2018). Specifically, by ensuring access to a large and insightful amount of information, the case study approach provides detailed and sound explanations for \"how\" and \"why\" questions, contributing to truly understanding the multifaceted phenomena of digital servitization transformation and the BM reconfiguration deriving therefrom (Chen et al., 2021; Paiola and Gebauer, 2020; Weking et al., 2020). To deeply comprehend the significant dynamics and complexities of the research topic, we adopted a process perspective, examining the case while things were happening, thus also boosting the results' validity, and reducing the possibility that informants would not accurately recall relevant events (Langley, 1999; Langley et al., 2013). Moreover, through the adoption of a process perspective, we were able to organize events and business transformations into distinct temporal spaces, which made it possible to comprehend the case story in great detail and recognize a progression over time (Decker, 2022). The use and combination of a single case study and a process perspective are considered appropriate in further advancing knowledge of novel, complex phenomena, as in our research case, and have been already applied in previous research (Chen, 2020; Decker, 2022; Tronvoll et al., 2020).\nIn particular, the effort that a process approach and a real-time viewpoint entail validates our decision to focus on just one case study to thoroughly examine the phenomenon that is the subject of this article (Pettigrew, 1990) and to contextualize the nature of the events (Tronvoll et al., 2020).\nFor this purpose, we selected an insightful case company, based on the following selection criteria: (a) the firm is an incumbent B2B company operating in the manufacturing industry; (b) it is involved in digital servitization projects using B2B platforms that render AI services; (c) it serves as an example of a visible process of pivoting, allowing us to gather useful insights to address our research question; (d) it acknowledges the significance of the research and makes a commitment to it; (e) it offers consistent access to data and informed sources, being available to collaborate, which facilitates meetings and interviews (Mason, 2002). In line with the research design and criteria, we investigated the case of a manufacturing company (Alpha) operating in the energy sector."}, {"title": "3.2. Data collection", "content": "The research process progressed through multiple stages, beginning with data collection and continuing through review and validation during the analysis phase. During data collection, both primary and secondary data were gathered combining a pluralistic approach (Evers et al., 2017). Primary data were collected from July 2023 to April 2024 through semi-structured interviews and workshops, following both real-time and retrospective perspectives, covering any relevant information for the analysis of our research topic (Pettigrew, 1990). Interviews and workshops were conducted with key informants: executive managers and project managers actively engaged in developing and implementing the digital servitization project were selected as sources of information to ensure material validity. An overview of data collected from key informants is reported in Table 1 below.\nFor the first interview sessions, with the aid of an interview guide, open-ended questions were posed to the respondents. The development of the semi-structured questionnaire was driven by themes related to the digital servitization journey, platform development, platform BM reconfiguration, and expected outcomes. Examples of questions used to discuss the main topics of interest are: What is your current value proposition and how has it changed over the years? What are the platform services you offer to your industrial clients? What is your approach to platform development? How has your platform strategy evolved throughout the digital servitization journey? How has platform usage evolved over time? How do you leverage platform and AI technologies? How do you exploit the platform for the implementation of AI service offerings? How did digital technologies change your platform BM? What are the value creation and value capture mechanisms you associate with platform services, and how did you define the proper ones? What role have customers played in your digital servitization journey? Are there external partners involved in digital services activities? If so, which ones and why? What are the main challenges you have experienced along the digital servitization journey? What is the evolution of the digital servitization journey in the near future?.\nTo truly comprehend Alpha's transition to digital servitization, during the course of meetings and interviews, we also used a forward-looking approach, posing foresight questions and assessing the digital servitization trajectory for the near future (Sarpong et al., 2019; Sarpong and O'Regan, 2014), inquiring about the changes that are already planned and in the process of being implemented, but not yet entirely executed.\nDuring the first meeting, a clarification about the digital servitization concept was provided by the researchers, to set a common knowledge base among the participants, although interviewees were knowledgeable about it. Researchers posed questions, opening up deep and frank conversations with the interviewees. Discussions with the respondents"}, {"title": "3.3. Data analysis", "content": "Interviews and the workshop were recorded and transcribed to increase accuracy and guarantee the possibility of consulting valuable insights ex-post. Interview and workshop notes were carefully examined jointly by the researchers. First, a comprehensive overview of the selected case was obtained, identifying the main relevant aspects related to its digital servitization transition. For this purpose, we followed the methodology developed by Gioia et al. (2013) that allowed us to classify and cluster the themes pertinent to our study. First, an initial reading and coding of primary data from interviews were conducted by all the researchers to identify essential information. Second, after processing the list of key information, also with the support of secondary data, similarities and overlaps were identified, producing a list of first-ordered categories of empirical concepts, grouping quotes, notes, and events.\nThese categories were then aggregated and linked to each other in a meaningful way, generating second-order conceptual themes. Finally, these were further consolidated and abstracted into aggregate dimensions. Combining the inductive approach with an abductive logic, in the last step of the analysis, we labeled the aggregate dimensions by connecting the findings from our empirical evidence with prior literature. Indeed, the concepts were not completely new, thus leading to a theory-driven coding. The result of the data analysis process is synthesized in Fig. 1 that shows the coding structure and highlights the three aggregate dimensions, namely \"Platform strategy evolution\", \"Platform development evolution\" and \"Platform business model evolution\". Results will be presented according to the phases of the"}]}

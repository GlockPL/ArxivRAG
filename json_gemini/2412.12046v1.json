{"title": "Artificial Intelligence in Traffic Systems", "authors": ["Ritwik Raj Saxena"], "abstract": "Traffic management is a pressing challenge in modern societies. The population of humans is amassing at a substantial pace, and along with that snowballs the expanse of urban areas as well as the number of private as well as public vehicles. This makes it increasingly more complicated to surveil and manage all transport modalities at the same time and at tenable costs. Also, with an expanding number of automobiles, vehicular congestion, a growing number of choke points and increased instances of on-road disruption collectively become rapidly burgeoning traffic management problems, especially in urban areas. These issues pose an exceedingly complex challenge for metropolitan communities, leading to financial losses, delays in the delivery of emergency services to people, environmental pollution, and a reduced quality of life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has stood out as a potent instrument towards resolving such questions. It has the capacity to augment traffic flow, accentuate transportation effectiveness, and raise the reassurance levels of passengers, commuters, as well as pedestrians. This article attempts to elucidate a myriad of applications of AI in the province of transportation management. It examines its potential to revolutionize urban transportation.\nExisting research on AI-based traffic management systems, utilizing techniques such as fuzzy logic, reinforcement learning, deep neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms, demonstrates the potential of AI to transform the traffic landscape. This article endeavors to review the topics where AI and traffic management intersect. It comprises areas like AI-powered traffic signal control systems, automatic distance and velocity recognition (for instance, in autonomous vehicles, hereafter AVs), smart parking systems, and Intelligent Traffic Management Systems (ITMS), which use data captured in real-time to keep track of traffic conditions, and traffic-related law enforcement and surveillance using AI.\nAI applications in traffic management cover a wide range of spheres. The spheres comprise, inter alia, streamlining traffic signal timings, predicting traffic bottlenecks in specific areas, detecting potential accidents and road hazards, managing incidents accurately, advancing public transportation systems, development of innovative driver assistance systems, and minimizing environmental impact through simplified routes and reduced emissions. The benefits of AI in traffic management are also diverse. They comprise improved management of traffic data, sounder route decision automation, easier and speedier identification and resolution of vehicular issues through monitoring the condition of individual vehicles, decreased traffic snarls and mishaps, superior resource utilization, alleviated stress of traffic management manpower, greater on-road safety, and better emergency response time.\nThe article acknowledges the challenges associated with implementation of AI-activated transportation management systems, such as acquisition of reliable data, concerns associated with data privacy, computational costs, and cybersecurity threats like adversarial attacks. It highlights the need for high-quality, real-time data to train and maintain AI models. There are additional challenges which are related to the integration of AI with existing traffic management infrastructure. Redressing these challenges would ensure that the public trust in such systems is maintained. Further, the existence of ethical considerations around bias in Al algorithms, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including gender insensitivity of AI models, creates another potential hurdle.", "sections": [{"title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "AI has the potential to engender a quantum shift in traffic management by bringing about smarter and more resilient transportation systems.

Metropolitan areas are grappling with exceeding complexity in traffic management. In this backdrop, the implementation of intelligent systems materializes as a promising solution. Advanced algorithms and modern methods of data analytics have been used to power intelligent systems. These systems brandish the potential to revolutionize how we navigate roads and systematize the flow of vehicles. This article delves into the intersection of AI and traffic management. It endeavors to explore the transformative applications and potential benefits of this technology [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]."}, {"title": "Definition of AI in traffic management", "content": "AI in traffic management refers to the application and strategic deployment of AI and associated technologies to adjust, augment and enrich the flow, safety, economy, efficiency, and ecological sustainability of traffic and to automate transportation systems. AI algorithms are built to analyze and process huge quantities of data that is obtained from a large variety of sources, including sensors, cameras, and historical traffic patterns, to make intelligent decisions and automate traffic management tasks [8]. AI, especially machine learning algorithms, are poised to learn from thus data and improve performance of traffic systems over. The algorithms help AI-grounded traffic systems to dynamically adapt to changing traffic conditions over a large duration as well as in real-time. These systems also allow for proactive traffic management by being able to forecast future traffic trends based on past data and current observations, which are carried out using advanced sensors or whose insights are fed to the models by humans.\nA significant component of AI in traffic management systems is their utility in developing strategies to minimize traffic crowding, especially since bunching up of vehicular traffic is a significant transportation problem in the current era, plaguing the roads and arteries not only of major urban centers but also of smaller towns. AI-powered systems prioritize the passage of, inter alia, ambulances, police vehicles, fire engines, for timely and effectual delivery of essential services and emergency response. This is carried out by dynamic adjustment of traffic signals and rerouting traffic based on real-time updates on road conditions [9]. One of the earliest applications of AI in traffic management was automated traffic signal control. Incident management and parking guidance are other manifestations of automation within AI in traffic management.\nAdjusting traffic signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions is an example of Al in traffic management. This process is usually powered by advanced sensors and fuzzy systems, but can also involve neural networks [10]. It helps maintain a smooth traffic flow. Furthermore, being fed with real-time data on accidents, road closures, and other incidents, AI systems can be used to implement appropriate responses concomitantly. AI-centered systems are leveraged to provide drivers with real-time route recommendations in order to help them avoid areas with vehicular huddling, thereby minimizing travel time [11]. These systems use real-time data on parking availability to direct drivers to available parking spaces. This is termed AI-based parking management [12].\nPerhaps the most well-known application of automation and AI in traffic management and transportation systems is self-driving cars. The integration of AI into self-driving cars enables them to navigate roads safely and efficiently. These vehicles, equipped with sophisticated AI algorithms, are capable of navigating complex road environments without human intervention. The integration of advanced sensors, such as LiDAR and high-definition cameras, in self-driving vehicles, enables such vehicles to efficiently perceive their surroundings, make driving-associated decisions in real-time, and execute the required on-the-road maneuvers with precision and efficiency [13]. Self-driving cars stand as an epitome of ultra-modern advances in transportation and improved accessibility for all."}, {"title": "Overview of Traditional Traffic Management", "content": "Traditional traffic management systems and AI-operated traffic systems represent two distinct approaches to addressing the challenges of urban transportation [14]. Traditional methods, many of which continue to be widely utilized, have served their purpose for several years. Innovative AI-driven transportation solutions involve significant advantages in terms of efficacy and resilience.\nConventional traffic management systems are commonly termed rule-based traffic management systems [15]. They are rooted in deterministic, formularized paradigms. They employ predefined algorithms, inert traffic models, and fixed parameters to regulate traffic. These systems can be computational or manual in nature, or a combination of the two, but are not necessarily considered intelligent. They operate within a framework of predetermined conditions as they rely on static procedures to govern the timing and sequencing of traffic signals. They have shown some effectualness in controlled environments. Conversely, they encounter limitations when applied to dynamic and arbitrary traffic patterns. These systems struggle to adapt to evolving traffic dynamics and to rapidly changing conditions, such as unexpected accidents, the presence of construction zones, road repair work, sudden weather events and other special happenings, in real-time. Consequently, their ability to minimize vehicular clustering is compromised. This leads to suboptimal performance.\nRule-based systems often require human operators to monitor traffic conditions and make adjustments [16]. Human operators are usually tasked with monitoring traffic conditions, identifying and communicating on- road anomalies and disruptions, and making manual adjustments to traffic signal timings and other control parameters. This high degree of human involvement is time-consuming as well as subjective and prone to errors. These systems have limited scalability. They also involve much manpower. These systems are characterized by disadvantageous response times, inefficiencies in decision-making, and heightened operational costs."}, {"title": "Summary of the Challenges Associated with Traditional Traffic Management", "content": "Traditional traffic management systems rely heavily on static infrastructure and manual processes. They face several challenges while being applied in modern urban environments (Figure 1). Suffering from ineffective resource allocation, conventional traffic systems lack the capacity to fully utilize available assets such as road infrastructure. These systems do not effectively allocate road space.\nThey are not able to efficaciously coordinate with public transportation networks. This leads to delays in reaching destinations, missed connections for passengers, overcrowding on roads and in public transport, and decreased ridership in public transport. In these systems, there is inefficiency in utilizing traffic signals and parking spaces. They also fail to address the multidimensional challenges inherent in modern traffic management environments. This happens due to a lack of flexibility, limited data utilization, subjective intervention, and a dearth of coordination.\nThese systems are exceedingly being pointed out for their lack of easy amenability to be integrated with other transportation systems like personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, trams, streetcars, light rail transit systems, metro rail transit systems, railways, buses and airlines. They also struggle to integrate parking systems and other infrastructure components. This lack of coordination prevents cities from managing traffic holistically. It further limits the general effectiveness of traffic control efforts (Figure 1).\nRising costs establish another challenge. Maintaining and upgrading aging infrastructure is expensive, especially as cities expand and traffic volumes grow. Lastly, traditional systems often have a higher environmental impact, as they rely on outdated methods that usually contribute to pollution. Excessive vehicle use for traffic control and emergency response exacerbates environmental damage. This highlights the need for more sustainable solutions like ITS."}, {"title": "An Outline of AI-Enhanced Traffic Management Systems", "content": "AI-fueled traffic management systems offer a strong contrast to rule-based traffic management systems. They are data-driven in nature, and can utilize real-time data from sensors, cameras, and connected vehicles to make informed decisions. They leverage powerful machine learning, reinforcement learning, and other intelligent models. They autonomously analyze and interpret historical data which is combined with data collected in real-time. This involves vast datasets. They can discern patterns and anomalies that elude the conventional rule-based approach. This transition to automated decision-making augments operational efficacy. Al-oriented traffic systems are a more appropriate embodiment of the synergy between human expertise and AI-driven technologies, revolutionizing the landscape of traffic management with unparalleled sophistication and adaptability.\nAI-infused traffic systems adeptly forecast traffic conditions such as peak traffic density during rush hours, unexpected traffic surges and bottlenecks due to extraordinary events such as road accidents, and fluctuations in traffic flow patterns based on historical data analysis. These systems can also preemptively identify potential disruptions such as unforeseen road closures, construction zones impacting traffic flow, adverse weather conditions afflicting road safety, and unanticipated changes in traffic volume due to emergencies like tornadoes. These systems involve the amalgamation of diverse data sources and cutting- edge computational models. By incorporating a combination of historical traffic patterns, weather data, and real-time sensor readings, these systems extrapolate future traffic scenarios with remarkable precision. They deploy sophisticated machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (for image recognition in traffic sign classification, real-time position understanding for AVs etc.) [17]. They also leverage advanced time series-based predictive modeling techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [15] and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks [18], which enables these systems to capture temporal dependencies and subtle fluctuations in traffic flow. This also empowers them to proactively adjust traffic signal timings, reroute vehicles dynamically, and strengthen traffic efficiency. Many of these systems encompass the fusion of predictive analytics and big data processing. They ease urban mobility and pave the way for a smarter and more responsive transportation ecosystem characterized by anticipatory decision- making and seamless traffic flow management.\nAI-triggered traffic systems make informed decisions to alleviate resource allocation. These systems feature a remarkable capacity to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings at intersections, improve lane assignments based on traffic flow patterns and allocate resources such as traffic enforcement personnel and emergency services in a responsive and adaptive manner. They depict the ability of adaptive signal control [19] by continuously adjusting traffic signals and other parameters for the better based on evolving traffic patterns. They not only boost the operational efficiency of transportation networks but also mitigate traffic snarls, palliate travel times, bolster safety on roadways, and augment sustainability and inclusivity of transportation systems.\nAI-based traffic management systems serve as a cornerstone in revolutionizing urban safety paradigms by proactively identifying and minimizing potential hazards on roadways. They enable swift responses through automated alerts, dynamic rerouting strategies, and facilitated emergency service dispatches. They engender the seamless coordination of connected vehicle technologies [20], roadside sensors, and centralized AI algorithms which facilitate the early detection of hazardous conditions. The operation of these systems helps execute timely interventions to prevent accidents, improve emergency response times, and inspire a safer urban transportation ecosystem.\nWe have seen that AI-based traffic management systems play a pivotal role in ensuring sustainability in resource allocation. They also promote equitable access to transportation infrastructure. They accommodate diverse transportation modes, including public transit, cycling, and walking, alongside traditional vehicular traffic. This ensures that underrepresented and underserved communities, who are often reliant on public transit, benefit from strengthened traffic mobility. AI-boosted traffic systems support sustainability by minimizing carbon emissions by reducing idle time and fuel consumption through adaptive signal control. They integrate multimodal transport systems, thus facilitating the prioritization of environmentally friendly options such as electric vehicles (EVs), car-sharing, and non-motorized transit like bicycles. Therefore, they contribute to a more verdant urban ecosystem."}, {"title": "Historical Context and the Evolution of AI in Transportation", "content": "The seeds of AI in transportation were sown in the mid-20th century, primarily in the realm of automation. One of the main manifestations of this was computerization of the traffic signal. The first steps toward automating traffic control were taken in the early 20th century with the initiation of electromechanical systems. These systems use a combination of mechanical timers and electrical relays to control traffic signals. A breakthrough came with the development of the traffic signal controller. This device was equipped with a microprocessor. It analyzes traffic data from various sensors, such as vehicle detectors and pedestrian push buttons. We are currently moving towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and multi-modal systems. Smart traffic lights and AI-driven signal control systems are an intricate part of ITSs. Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) [20] communications, as parts of smart signaling, are also implemented within ITS and help in seamless data exchange between connected vehicles and infrastructure elements. ITSs also involve integration of distributed, edge & cloud computing for real- time traffic management in high-traffic environments. ITSs, in various stages of development, have been implemented in global cities like London and Shanghai [21]. An ITS forms a part of the broader Smart Cities initiative, key to which is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.\nAnother manifestation of this was the automation of highway toll systems. The initiation of computerized highway toll systems dates back to the early 1970s when electronic toll collection (ETC) prototype experiments were carried out. By the late 1980s, ETC systems gained traction in Norway. Throughout the 1990s, the use of ETC systems expanded globally. Technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), transponders, electronic toll collection lanes, and centralized systems were crucial in automating toll collection processes. The institutive process involved pilot programs, infrastructure development, public education campaigns, and system integration to ensure the smooth adoption of ETC systems. These computerized toll systems brought about various benefits, including reduced chance of traffic jams, finessed productivity, amplified safety, and enhanced convenience for drivers. In recent years, advancements in highway toll system technology have further developed toll collection methods. Contactless payment integration through mobile wallets and NFC tags, multi-lane free flow systems with advanced sensors, dynamic pricing strategies, integration with ITS, and electric vehicle charging station integration have been implemented.\nOne of the most widely studied topics in the realm of transport automation is AVs. The history of AVs dates to 1939, when General Motors unveiled an exhibit called Futurama in New York. It was a diorama installation that featured automated highways. From 1980 to 2003, university research centers, often in collaboration with transportation agencies and automotive companies, conducted studies on autonomous transportation. The NavLab project, set up at Carnegie Mellon University around the mid-1980's, involved the development and testing of AVs, starting from NavLab 1 up to NavLab 11 [22] [23]. DARPA's Grand Challenges boosted AV technology. Stanley, an innovative robot vehicle, as a part of these challenges, won an AV race in 2005 [24]. Google's Driverless Car initiative made significant advances in commercializing AV technology starting the early 2010s, and the initiative continues to grow.\nThe 1990's saw the beginning of the age of ITSs. ITSs integrated sensors, communication networks, and AI algorithms within the realm of transportation. They utilized methodologies like Adaptive Traffic Control"}, {"title": "Fundamentals of Traffic Systems", "content": "Traffic systems refer to the aggregate of infrastructure, rules, and technologies that govern the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on roadways. Traffic systems, as a topic, broadly subsumes roads and highways, traffic signals and signs, transportation management systems, and traffic laws, regulations and security. Traffic systems, while essentially a general term, covers only road traffic within its ambit, and not air traffic and railways. Air traffic is covered under aviation (aviation engineering), while railway traffic is covered under rail transportation (rail transportation engineering or rail traffic engineering). Traffic systems are founded upon the principles of traffic flow theory and modeling, concepts which provide a framework for understanding the behavior of vehicles and drivers on roadways."}, {"title": "Overview of Traffic Flow Theory", "content": "Traffic flow theories are mathematical models that seek to explain how vehicles, drivers, and infrastructure interact with each other's presence on the road. They are used by transportation engineers to stimulate (model), understand and analyze traffic flow (Figure 2). They help in finding ways to introduce and redesign infrastructure elements like signage, traffic lights, traffic cameras and markings.\nThe scientific study of traffic flow can be traced back to the early 20th century. As urbanization and industrialization led to a rapidly growing automobile ownership and thereby the frequency of traffic jams, there was a growing need to understand and manage traffic flows precisely. One of the earliest significant contributions to the field came from Bruce Greenshields in the 1930s [27].\nHis work involved applying probability theory to understand road traffic flow and it laid the foundation for understanding how individual vehicles interact and influence traffic flow. Since then, the field has continued to evolve, with researchers developing more complex models, collecting and analyzing vast amounts of traffic data, and applying advanced technologies like AI (including machine learning) to upgrade the current pattern of traffic management."}, {"title": "Fundamental Diagram of Traffic Flow Theory", "content": "V = Vr\nVV\nV\nVo\n\u0667=Vo\nSpeed (km/hr)\nSpeed (km/hr)\n\u0667-0\n\u0667\u0660\u0665\nK-0\n\u041a\u043e\nKj\nQ-0\nQm\nDensity (veh/km/lane)\nFlow (veh/hr/lane)\nQ = K * V\nUncongested\nQ = K * V\nFlow (veh/hr/lane)\nQm\nCongested\nQ = Ko * Vo\nQm = (K_i * V_r)/2\nQ-0\nK-0\nK-Ko\nDensity (veh/km/lane)\nKj\nQm = (K_j * V_r)/4"}, {"title": "Traffic Management Strategies", "content": "Traffic management strategies are approaches and techniques used to coordinate vehicular flow, minimize collisions and the likelihood of roads shutting down and cause furtherance in the safety of motorway networks. This falls under traffic engineering, transportation engineering or highway engineering. Some of the key traffic management strategies are discussed here."}, {"title": "Traffic Signal Control", "content": "Signal control is a fundamental strategy in traffic management. It uses traffic lights and signaling devices to regulate vehicle flow at intersections. It plays a key role in urban transportation by activating a better traffic flow, lowering the probability of traffic jams, and stirring road safety levels. The primary objectives of signal control include maximizing traffic throughput, minimizing delays, boosting safety, and mitigating road closures. At busy city intersections, traffic lights are synchronized to allow a maximum number of vehicles to pass through during a green light. This helps reduce the time vehicles spend idling.\nFixed-time signal control is a traditional method of signal control. In it, signals operate on a predetermined cycle [29]. This fact makes fixed-time signal control suitable for intersections with relatively stable traffic patterns, such as in residential neighborhoods. Nonetheless, this method can be uneconomical during peak hours when traffic is highly variable. In contrast, actuated control uses sensors to detect vehicles and adjust signals in response to actual traffic conditions. This approach offers greater flexibility, making it ideal for areas where traffic flow changes frequently, such as near commercial centers. Intersections near commercial areas like shopping malls often use actuated signals to prevent unnecessary delays when traffic is light.\nA more advanced approach is adaptive signal control. Adaptive control dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic data [30]. This system is particularly useful in large cities where traffic patterns fluctuate throughout the day. Adaptive signals in metropolitan areas respond to rush-hour surges by adjusting light cycles to ease traffic jams in real time. Though highly lucrative and beneficial, adaptive systems require advanced technology and data collection to operate functionally and as intended. Traffic signal priority is a signal control technique which accords precedence to specific vehicles like emergency services and public transit. For instance, an ambulance may trigger signal changes to get through traffic faster. This reduces emergency response times in critical situations.\nSynchronized traffic signals along major corridors create a green wave effect. The green wave effect allows vehicles to move smoothly through a series of lights with minimal stops. This approach is implemented on major urban roads where traffic is heavy. Coordinating the signals causes a burgeoning in the plausibility of the movement of road vehicles becoming much more cost-effective.\nThe accuracy and efficacy of signal control depends on such factors as traffic volume, composition, intersection geometry, and pedestrian traffic. A crowded downtown intersection with high pedestrian activity and multiple turning lanes begs a more sophisticated signal control strategy than a simple suburban intersection with light traffic and fewer turning lanes. As urban areas expand and traffic patterns become more complex, signal control systems should also adapt. The integration of signal control with ITSs and connected vehicles represents a future trend that targets to make traffic organization better [31]. The use of big data and analytics is becoming essential for rationalizing signal control strategies. Traffic data collected from various sources informs better decision-making. It ensures that signals are adjusted based on real-time conditions."}, {"title": "Congestion Pricing", "content": "Congestion pricing is a traffic management strategy that charges drivers a fee for using roads during peak hours or in highly jampacked traffic zones. The primary goal of enforcing congestion pricing is to reduce traffic gridlocks through discouragement of driving during busy times. This system typically relies on electronic tolling. In this, vehicles are automatically charged as they pass through designated areas. Dynamic pricing is another feature which is a part of some congestion pricing systems [32]. Under this, fees are adjusted based on the level of vehicular queuing.\nCongestion pricing incentivizes people to find alternative routes, travel at off-peak hours in lieu of rush hour, and use public transportation. This helps cut back the number of vehicles on the road and rein in emissions to liven up sustainability and eco-friendliness. Congestion pricing generates revenue for cities and transportation agencies. This revenue is usually reinvested in infrastructure developments and in boosting public transportation systems, such as funding new bus routes. This expands and further encourages public transit options for commuters.\nNevertheless, congestion pricing comes with its challenges. Concerns related to social equity arise in relation to congestion pricing since low-income drivers are disproportionately affected by it. Such drivers have fewer alternatives available to them. This makes the fees feel unfair, especially if public transportation options are limited in such areas. The costs of implementing a congestion pricing system are also a consideration. Putting such initiatives in place requires investments in technology and infrastructure such as electronic toll systems, traffic monitoring tools, RFID technology, and enforcement mechanisms [33]. Public acceptance of programs like this is commonly a barrier [34]. Many drivers resist the idea of paying additional fees for roads they are accustomed to using without charge. A number of city administrations have faced pushback and backlash from drivers unwilling to participate in such endeavors.\nThere are successful examples of congestion pricing in certain major cities. A Congestion Charge rule has been in implementation in London, United Kingdom. In this, drivers are charged a fee to enter a certain zone called the congestion charge zone, during peak hours. Singapore has a system of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) [35]. Under this, drivers are charged when they want to enter certain specific areas during peak times. This system uses electronic tolls. Both systems have demonstrated the serviceability, supportability, and utility of congestion pricing in reducing traffic and encouraging alternative forms of transportation. They also help generate revenue for urban development projects in their respective areas."}, {"title": "Tolling", "content": "Tolling is another traffic management strategy where drivers are charged a fee to use certain roads, bridges, and tunnels. The main goal is to manage traffic flow, generate revenue for infrastructure maintenance and advancements, and, in some cases, discourage the overuse of frequently clogged traffic routes. Toll roads are common in many countries. In the United States, the New Jersey Turnpike [36] and Florida's Turnpike [37] are examples of toll roads that use fees to maintain infrastructure and manage traffic. In Europe, countries like France and Italy use toll systems extensively on their major highways.\nTolling can be implemented in several ways, including traditional toll booths, where drivers pay manually, and modern electronic tolling systems that automatically charge vehicles. Variable tolling, also termed congestion tolling or dynamic pricing, is a way of tolling in which fees upsurge during peak hours in highly areas prone to traffic gridlocks.\nOne of the key benefits of tolling is its ability to generate revenue for transportation projects. The funds collected can be used to maintain roads, develop infrastructure, and expand public transportation systems. Tolling also helps decrease roadblocks by discouraging excessive use of certain routes. When drivers must pay to use busy highways, a preference for alternative transportation routes and modes automatically grows.\nTolling can take various forms, depending on the goals of the transportation system. Congestion-based tolling involves charging higher fees during peak traffic times to mitigate traffic blockages. For example, tolls on the I-66 express lanes in Northern Virginia fluctuate based on the level of traffic, intensifying during rush hour to deter drivers and to cause a decline in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) [38]. Distance-based tolling charges drivers based on the distance traveled on a toll road. This ensures that long-distance travelers pay more for using the infrastructure more. Flat-rate tolling, on the contrary, charges a fixed fee for road usage, regardless of time and distance of usage.\nAll the lanes on I-66 Beltway have shifted from high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to high-occupancy toll (HOT). HOV lanes are lanes restrictions on use of single-occupancy vehicles (SOV) apply in order to endorse ridesharing. HOV lanes have been set up at various places across US and the rules that govern their use vary [38]. Vehicles carrying two or more people are generally permitted on HOV lanes. At times, motorcycles and vehicles that use alternative sources of energy are also permitted, thereby promoting sustainable transportation. Curbs on the use of HOV lanes can operate either round-the-clock or just during rush hours and known periods of high traffic logjam possibility. Where there is excess capacity on HOV lanes, HOT lanes may be implemented, where motor vehicles carrying only one person can use these lanes for a fee. In regions where these lanes serve as major arteries, the use of such lanes by proscribed vehicles may be allowed for a fee, thereby implementing congestion pricing through tolling."}, {"title": "AI Technologies and Their Applications in Traffic Management", "content": "Al technologies which involve statistical analysis, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and so on, are gradually becoming the new normal in traffic management. With accumulating human population and an escalation in traffic pressure on urban areas, AI-powered technologies are providing the necessary innovation to cohere traffic flow in a way that suits the demands of metropolitan zones (Figure 3). These innovative technologies upgrade transportation supportability, value, and resilience for road users.\nRoad traffic prediction implies utilizing traffic data dynamically to forecast the traffic situation in a particular region given various circumstances like an accident, an unusual or adverse weather event, rush hours, the start of road construction work or any other roadside infrastructure development project and so on. Precise and well-timed forecasts provide relevant support to commuters, drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. along with traffic management administration, and to traffic policy advisors and transport infrastructure advisory panels. These forecasts serve to assist transportation operations and traffic route scheduling. They also inform and serve as guides to traffic infrastructure expansion.\nThis prediction can be based on the output of existing mathematical models of traffic which have been constructed taking into account various parameters that can influence traffic like the time of the day, the occurrence of an unexpected event and so on. They are simulation models. This prediction can also be made based on the algorithmic analysis of real-time data, for instance, the number of cars and so on. The data- driven approach, based on machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms and other intelligent methods, has been found to be more reliable since the model-based approach is based on static models. However, a hybrid approach has been proposed as the best [39].\nIn this way, machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, regression models, and deep learning, are becoming central to predicting traffic flow. These algorithms can be designed to develop the capability to analyze vast datasets, including historical traffic patterns, weather conditions, and real-time traffic data, to forecast gridlocks and suggest optimal routes. Deep learning models predict how traffic will change throughout the day. This allows for better traffic signal timing and route planning. Real-time traffic monitoring systems, supported by machine learning, dynamically respond to sudden changes, such as accidents or road closures. This ensures a more resilient traffic management.\nAI-enabled computer vision plays a vital role in traffic management. This is especially in the case of AVs. Computer vision systems like CNNs and vision transformers (ViTs) detect, identify, and track vehicles in real-time. This helps traffic management systems and ITSs gauge vehicle movements and traffic obstruction levels. In AVs, computer vision, with the use of cameras, LiDARs and sometimes other sensors like infrared sensors and radars, enables cars to \u201cobserve\u201d their surroundings, giving the cars positional awareness. The cars can recognize and detect objects, other vehicles, pedestrians, road signs, traffic signals, guardrails, median dividers, lane markings, and other features of the road, and adjust their own driving accordingly. When an obstruction, a red or yellow traffic signal, a pedestrian, a slowing vehicle in the same lane as the AV, and so on, is detected on the road, the vision system detects it and passes on the information to the control unit, which changes the velocity of the car accordingly. Sometimes AI systems are integrated with AVs to provide actionable real-time data on traffic conditions and enable a more relaxed navigation through crowded urban environments. The images of the surrounding environment captured by the sensors of the AV are segmented to give the control unit in the AV a thorough grasp on its vicinity. This extenuates the likelihood of accidents.\nReinforcement learning (RL) helps in implementing various smart tasks (AI tasks) in traffic management. Adaptive traffic signal control is one such task where RL can prove beneficial, as these systems can be precisely and incrementally strengthened via trial-and-error and reward-and-punishment methodologies [40]. Adaptive traffic signal control systems are those traffic signal control systems which have been able to learn how to adjust and rationalize traffic signal timings based on real-time conditions. RL algorithms make decisions by continuously interacting with the traffic environment. They repeatedly adjust signal timings to ameliorate vehicle flow. One case study from Pittsburgh [41] exemplifies how adaptive signal control systems have successfully managed complex urban traffic patterns.\nIn traffic management NLP is used in dynamic messaging signs and communication with drivers [42]. NLP algorithms analyze and generate human-readable messages on digital road signs to alert drivers about traffic conditions, accidents, or route changes. The use of real-time data ensures that the messages displayed are timely and relevant. This facilitates communication between traffic management systems and drivers. NLP is integrated into voice-activated navigation systems such as Google Maps. This provides drivers with traffic updates and alternative route suggestions in natural language.\nAI technologies are also instrumental in incident detection and management. Using data from traffic cameras, sensors, and GPS, AI systems predict and detect accidents and other incidents in real time. Machine learning models analyze patterns and identify potential high-risk areas. This empowers authorities to take necessary preventive measures. In the event of an accident, AI systems automatically coordinate emergency response services to enable faster response times. AI-operated platforms in cities like Singapore detect traffic incidents and send automatic alerts to emergency services [43]. This resolves emergency response times and mitigates the influence of traffic disruptions on emergency response.\nEdge and cloud computing utilize distributed computing and are being applied to traffic and transportation management. These technologies empower the proficient collection, processing, and analysis of vast amounts of traffic data from various sources. Decisions can be made quickly in high-traffic environments if AI models are deployed at the edge. In this way, edge computing maximizes throughput and minimizes latency for timely interventions. It helps in dynamic traffic monitoring and real-time decision-making.\nPublic transportation systems also benefit from AI-driven optimization. AI technologies are being used to smoothen bus and rail scheduling. These technologies ensure that public transport services run on time and adapt to changing conditions. Intelligent route planning systems provide commuters with real-time updates on the best routes and travel options. This makes public transportation more reliable and appealing. This in turn contributes to proliferation of ridership and dropped reliance on private vehicles [44] [45] [46]."}, {"title": "Advanced Transportation Management Systems", "content": "Advanced Transportation Management Systems (ATMS) are critical components of extant urban infrastructure. They work in tandem with Smart Cities. They enable better traffic management and flow, moderated possibility of traffic snarls and a strengthened productivity of transportation networks.\nATMS engage various traffic sensors to collect essential data so that they can undertake data-driven decision-making. Inductive loops, embedded in roads, are sensors which detect vehicles by measuring changes in electrical current. Magnetic sensors can also be employed within ATMS to detect vehicles. Magnetic sensors record changes in the earth's magnetic field caused by passing cars. Cameras provide visual data like vehicle counts and speeds. A LiDAR uses laser beams to create 3D maps of the environment. Radar systems, using radio wave reflections, are equipped to detect the presence of vehicles under various unusual weather conditions. To be analyzed, all the data collected through these sensors is carried to the hub, that is, the central control system. Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) play a vital role in V2V and V2I communications [47", "48": "."}]}

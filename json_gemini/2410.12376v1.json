Shapefile, the most widely used vector data format, has become the industry standard supported by all major geographic information systems. However, processing this data typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills, creating a barrier for researchers from other fields and impeding interdisciplinary research in spatial data analysis. Moreover, while large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and task automation, they still face challenges in handling the complex spatial and topological relationships inherent in GIS vector data. To address these challenges, we propose ShapefileGPT, an innovative framework powered by LLMs, specifically designed to automate Shapefile tasks. ShapefileGPT utilizes a multi-agent architecture, in which the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and supervision, while the worker agent executes the tasks. We developed a specialized function library for handling Shapefiles and provided comprehensive API documentation, enabling the worker agent to operate Shapefiles efficiently through function calling. For evaluation, we developed a benchmark dataset based on authoritative textbooks, encompassing tasks in categories such as geometric operations and spatial queries. ShapefileGPT achieved a task success rate of 95.24%, outperforming the GPT series models. In comparison to traditional LLMs, ShapefileGPT effectively handles complex vector data analysis tasks, demonstrating superior spatial data understanding and analytical capabilities, and overcoming the limitations of traditional models in spatial reasoning. This breakthrough opens new pathways for advancing automation and intelligence in the GIS field, with significant potential in interdisciplinary data analysis and application contexts.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The integration of geographic information science (GIS) with artificial intelligence has propelled the development of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) [1]. During this process, vector data plays a crucial role in responsibility of representing spatial information and describing geographic objects along with their spatial relationships [2]. Shapefile, the most commonly used vector data format, and although it offers broad compatibility and flexibility, efficiently handling Shapefiles typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills. As an interdisciplinary field, GIS has seen applications in urban planning, environmental science, agriculture, public health, and many other fields. For researchers or professionals in these fields, limited GIS expertise often becomes a significant barrier to using Shapefiles for spatial data analysis. While the Shapefile format offers great compatibility and flexibility, its manipulation and analysis generally rely on professional GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS, which imposes a steep learning curve for non-GIS users. Lowering the technical barriers for conducting spatial analysis of vector data has thus become a key challenge in advancing the widespread adoption and development of GeoAI.\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in processing both text and structured data, demonstrating impressive capabilities in automated data processing [3, 4, 5]. However, LLMs face considerable challenges when addressing complex spatial tasks in GIS [6, 7]. Specifically, while current GPT models can generate code and automate routine tasks, the accuracy and reliability of the generated code are not always assured [8]. These limitations become even more pronounced when dealing with the intricate spatial and topological relationships unique to the GIS, where the generated code often fails to meet the requirements of professional applications. This suggests that developing an LLM framework specifically tailored for Shapefiles would not only better address the complex demands of GIS, improving the accuracy and automation of task handling, but also offer researchers from interdisciplinary fields an accessible tool for effectively managing spatial data.\nMeanwhile, tool-calling technology is particularly crucial in the GIS domain. As LLMs continue to evolve, they have shown remarkable progress in reasoning and knowledge integration. For example, through techniques like chain of thought [9] and reinforcement learning [10], advanced models such as OpenAI's o1 model excel in logical reasoning, applying domain-specific knowledge, and natural language processing [11]. Nevertheless, without deep integration with external specialized systems, the potential of these models in the GIS domain remains largely untapped. Enabling LLMs to interact with external systems through tool-calling can significantly expand their utility in specialized contexts, especially in handling complex vector data tasks [12]. Currently, efficient solutions that integrate LLMs with Shapefiles in GIS are lacking, presenting a novel entry point for our research."}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "Large Language Model Agents The landscape of large language model (LLM) agents has rapidly evolved, achieving a series of breakthroughs. An LLM agent is defined as a framework composed of three components: brain, perception, and action [13]. Agent architectures can be classified as single-agent or multi-agent, depending on the number of agents involved [14]. In the ReAct framework [15], the agent first reasons about the task and then executes actions based on that reasoning, demonstrating greater effectiveness than traditional methods such as zero-shot prompting, where the model acts without prior task-specific training. Building on ReAct, RAISE [16] introduces a memory mechanism to enhance the agent's ability to retain and utilize contextual information. Reflexion [17] employs self-reflection in a single-agent system, leveraging an LLM evaluator and metrics like success state and memory to provide targeted feedback, significantly improving overall task performance. Moreover, [18] underscores the crucial role of a lead agent in enhancing the effectiveness of embodied LLM agent teams. AgentVerse [19] demonstrates how structured phases in group planning can enhance agents' reasoning and problem-solving abilities.\nGIS Agent Framework In the GIS field, an increasing number of studies are focusing on how to utilize LLM agents to automate geospatial data processing, reducing human intervention and improving analysis efficiency [20]. Several LLM-based automation frameworks have demonstrated significant progress in GIS applications. LLM-Geo [21] has demonstrated significant potential in the study of autonomous GIS. The system achieves automatic data generation and autonomous task execution through LLMs, allowing for automatic map generation, spatial data aggregation, and result visualization. MapGPT [22] is an intelligent mapping framework. It uses natural language processing to understand user requirements and calls various mapping tools to generate map elements, significantly simplifying the map-making process while offering users greater creative control. Additionally, research has extracted knowledge from Google Earth Engine (GEE) workflow scripts related to geographic analysis models [23]. The framework extracts descriptive and procedural knowledge of geographic analysis from complex GEE scripts and packages this knowledge into reusable templates, enabling sharing and application in different geographic modeling environments. POI GPT [24] uses named entity recognition (NER) combined with LLMs to extract precise POI locations from text data, reducing the cost and time traditionally required to extract spatial information from text data such as social media posts. One study [25] explored the use of multi-agent systems in intelligent transportation systems, utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology to improve the efficiency of smart city mobility applications. GPT4GEO [26] explored the capabilities of GPT-4 in geospatial tasks such as route planning, disaster management, and supply chain analysis.\nTool-augmented Large Language Models Tool-augmented Large Language Models allow LLMs to connect with external tools, effectively overcoming inherent limitations. By integrating resources such as search engines for external knowledge access or calculators to enhance mathematical capabilities, LLMs can also be utilized for repetitive daily tasks [27, 28, 29]. One significant challenge with LLMs is their black-box nature and the issue of hallucinations, where models generate inaccurate information. To address this, research has focused on improving retrieval capabilities, allowing LLMs to generate citation-backed content, thereby increasing the trustworthiness of their output [30]. Compared to traditional LLMs, LLM agents demonstrate enhanced intelligence, particularly when integrated with external tools. These tool-augmented agents can perform more complex tasks. For example, the open-source project AutoGPT functions as a fully autonomous system, executing tasks without user intervention [31]. Additionally, Navi, a multi-modal agent capable of processing various input types, can simulate human operations within the Windows operating system [32].\nInspired by the above research, we propose ShapefileGPT. While existing studies have demonstrated the vast potential of LLMs in GIS applications, most focus on high-level data generation or the automation of specific tasks, lacking support for concrete vector data operations. Additionally, current GIS automation frameworks are primarily designed for professional GIS users, leaving researchers from non-GIS fields facing high technical barriers when using these tools. ShapefileGPT addresses these gaps by enhancing LLMs' capabilities in understanding and analyzing vector data, making it applicable not only to specific use cases but also to a broad range of spatial data analysis tasks. Moreover, ShapefileGPT lowers the technical barriers for non-specialists by enabling natural language interaction, facilitating more widespread use of GIS data processing in interdisciplinary collaboration."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "ShapefileGPT enables the execution of spatial analysis tasks on Shapefiles using natural language. It takes both the full Shapefile and the user's task as input, progressively analyzing and processing vector data, and ultimately saving the results as images, tables, or Shapefile files. The system employs a division of labor between the planner agent and worker agent. The planner agent acts as the decision-making hub, receiving user instructions and breaking them down into subtasks, while the worker agent is responsible for executing these specific subtasks. The agents communicate through internal APIs, collaborating to automate task processing.\nThe planner agent is equipped with advanced observation, reasoning, and memory capabilities, allowing it to accurately interpret user requirements and intelligently decompose them into detailed subtasks. During task execution, the planner agent continuously monitors progress, formulates and adjusts subtasks based on real-time conditions, and guides the worker agent in their execution. As the worker agent completes tasks and reports the results, the planner agent updates its memory to optimize future task management, continuing this iterative process until the entire task is completed and the final result is returned to the user.\nThe worker agent handles specific data processing tasks by invoking the specialized Shapefile function library via APIs, ensuring precision and efficiency. It conducts detailed analyses of each subtask, executing them sequentially, and providing real-time feedback to the planner agent."}, {"title": "3.2 Enhancing LLMs with Function Calling", "content": "We enable LLMs to execute real Shapefile tasks through function calling. Function Calling is a mechanism that enhances the interaction between LLMs and external programs, allowing the model to invoke predefined functions while generating text. This mechanism enables the execution of complex tasks by not only allowing LLMs to generate natural language but also interact with external programs, databases, or APIs. It supports complex computations, real-time data access, and specialized task processing."}, {"title": "3.3 Multi-Agent Framework", "content": "Multi-Agent architecture Our proposed ShapefileGPT adopts a vertical multi-agent architecture. While a single-agent architecture performs well for simple, straightforward tasks, it exhibits limitations when confronted with complex reasoning, such as an inability to process tasks in parallel and a tendency to generate hallucinations [14]. In the vertical multi-agent architecture, one agent acts as the leader, responsible for overall planning and monitoring sub-tasks, while the other agents serve as executors to carry out specific tasks. This architecture is particularly well-suited for complex multi-step tasks, especially in vector data analysis, as it simplifies the execution of each step while maintaining logical clarity.\nPlanner Agent In our architecture, the planner acts as the leader, and the worker serves as the executor. The planner's task is to break down the user's instructions into multiple sub-tasks and assign them to the worker for execution. As shown in Fig. 3, after the user uploads the Shapefile and task instructions, the system initializes the planner's work environment. This environment records task progress, current task status, and the planner's memory state such as information about previously executed tasks. The planner then performs its task planning through a planning loop, where each cycle represents the lifecycle of a sub-task, from task breakdown to task completion. In each loop, the planner first observes the current task state and determines whether the task has been completed. If the task is not complete, the planner generates a new sub-task and assigns it to the worker for execution. Once the planner receives the results from the worker, it updates the task environment to ensure that subsequent tasks are correctly planned and executed.\nWorker Agent The worker, functioning as the executor, follows the workflow outlined in the working loop shown in Fig. 4. Upon receiving a task from the planner, the worker initiates task execution within its environment. This environment consists of the function library and the provided API documentation. The function library offers the names and functional descriptions of each API, assisting the worker in selecting the most suitable API. The API documentation details the parameter rules for each API, ensuring that the worker can correctly configure the necessary parameters for API calls. Additionally, the worker's environment contains descriptive information about the Shapefile to be processed, which is essential for vector data tasks. During execution, the worker must understand the geometry type, field names, and attribute table information of the current Shapefile to prevent errors, such as referencing non-existent columns or fields when invoking functions. This ensures both task accuracy and reliability."}, {"title": "3.4 Task Datasets", "content": "To evaluate the performance of online large language models against our designed ShapefileGPT, we constructed a Shapefile task dataset to test both under identical conditions. Referring to the spatial analysis case from [2, 33], we developed a standardized dataset for Shapefile tasks. Each task includes a structured task definition, consisting of a task ID, geometry type, task category, task description, input and output file paths, and user prompts. A specific example is provided in Fig. 5."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we present the experiments designed for our proposed ShapefileGPT and the corresponding results. Specifically, in Sec. 4.1, we provide a detailed description of the experimental setup and the baseline models for comparison experiments. In Sec. 4.2, we present the comparative results of ShapefileGPT and the GPT series models in executing Shapefile tasks. In Sec. 4.3, we describe the comparison experiments of ShapefileGPT with different configurations. In Sec. 4.4, we validate the role of the Agent module through case studies. Finally, in Sec. 4.5 and 4.6, we introduce the results of ablation studies. Besides the experiments, we also developed an interactive web interface for ShapefileGPT using Python's Streamlit framework, allowing users to directly upload data and obtain results via the interface shown in Fig. 7, further improving the system's ease of use and practicality."}, {"title": "4.1 Setup", "content": "Datasets Our experiments are conducted on the task dataset introduced in Sec. 3.4. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of Shapefile tasks, including various geometric operations, spatial queries, and calculation tasks. It is specifically designed to assess the capability of different models in handling complex vector data and performing related operations.\nBaseline Models We compared ShapefileGPT with several models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, GPT-40-Mini-2024-07-18, and GPT-40-2024-05-13. As shown in Fig. 8, we utilized OpenAI's assistant and file APIs to evaluate the ability of these GPT models to perform Shapefile tasks. Users begin by uploading the relevant Shapefile task files to OpenAI's file storage space via the file interface. The assistant is then configured with the necessary parameters, and task instructions are sent. The Assistant can access the files from the File Storage Space, generate the required code, and execute it in a sandbox environment to complete the Shapefile task. Upon completion, the Assistant generates a response for the user and stores the result in the File Storage Space for retrieval."}, {"title": "4.2 Comparing Task execution Ability with Different LLMs", "content": "We conducted performance tests on both the Baseline Models and ShapefileGPT using the same dataset and performed a detailed analysis of their results. For the GPT series models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, GPT-40-Mini-2024-07-18, and GPT-40-2024-05-13, we recorded the code generation outputs, user responses, and final result files from their task executions. This data was used for subsequent analysis to evaluate the performance of these models in executing real-world tasks.\nFor ShapefileGPT, we manually inspected the function calling records and final outputs for each task to determine whether it accurately completed the task under the same user prompts. For the GPT models, we reviewed their responses, generated code, and final outputs to assess whether they successfully executed the tasks. The number of successfully executed tasks for both models on the dataset is displayed in Fig. 10.\nAs shown in the experimental results in Table 3, GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 achieved an accuracy rate of 33.33% and a success rate of 35.71%. The newer GPT-40-2024-05-13 performed slightly better, with an accuracy rate of 42.86% and a success rate of 45.24%. In contrast, ShapefileGPT demonstrated significantly superior performance on the same tasks, with an accuracy rate of 92.86% and a success rate of 95.24%, greatly surpassing the GPT models, particularly in its reliability when handling complex GIS tasks."}, {"title": "4.3 Comparing Different Configurations of ShapefileGPT", "content": "In this section, we conducted performance comparison experiments with multiple model configurations for ShapefileGPT to assess how foundational models perform in task environments. By testing various model combinations, we aim to identify which configurations excel in the system's agent tasks, thereby helping to establish the performance limits of ShapefileGPT.\nIn the experimental design, we defined two key modules of the ShapefileGPT system: the planner, responsible for task decomposition and instruction generation, and the worker, which executes specific operations. To ensure the planner module efficiently breaks down complex tasks and generates reasonable execution instructions, the foundational model selected must have strong reasoning and planning abilities. In contrast, the worker module focuses on selecting the appropriate API from the contextual API documentation to execute specific tasks, so the model it relies on must have strong capabilities in retaining contextual information and accurately calling APIs, ensuring no important document content is overlooked.\nAs shown in the experimental results in Table 4, ShapefileGPT under configuration 1 achieved the highest accuracy and success rates, at 92.86% and 95.24%, respectively. In terms of repeat call rate, configuration 2 demonstrated a significantly lower rate of 0.0079 compared to other model combinations, indicating more efficient task completion with reduced redundant function calls. These results suggest that the GPT-40 series models not only excel at handling complex tasks but also significantly reduce system resource wastage.\nThe accuracy of parameter calls is a key metric for evaluating a model's ability to generate valid function calls. In all configurations, this value was 100%, indicating that the GPT models successfully generated correct function calls based on standardized API documentation. This metric validates the reasoning capabilities of the GPT models, demonstrating their proficiency in making accurate function calls, which lays the groundwork for more advanced tool utilization.\nWhen the worker model was replaced with GPT-3.5-Turbo (configurations 4 and 5), both the accuracy and success rate dropped significantly, with the accuracy at 7.14% and the success rate at 23.81%, while the repeat call rate was as high as 1.5543. The primary cause of this performance decline was GPT-3.5-Turbo's poor function-calling ability. It failed to effectively select the appropriate APIs from the documentation to execute tasks assigned by the planner, leading to task stalls. This inefficiency forced the planner to repeatedly issue the same instructions, significantly reducing the system's overall efficiency. These results demonstrate that GPT-3.5-Turbo lags considerably behind the more advanced GPT-40 series in function-calling capabilities and is unable to effectively support the accurate operation of the ShapefileGPT system."}, {"title": "4.4 Validation of the Agent Module Through Case Studies", "content": "This section validated the effectiveness of the planner and worker modules through multiple GIS case studies, focusing on the planner's ability to interpret user instructions and decompose tasks, as well as the worker module's precision in calling GIS functions and executing tasks."}, {"title": "4.4.1 Case 1: Spatial Allocation of Points by Distance", "content": "This case demonstrates how the planner and worker modules complete a distance-based point feature spatial allocation. The user provided a point feature dataset and requested the generation of voronoi polygons along with a 500-meter buffer analysis around the point features. The planner module decomposed the task into three steps: (1) Generate Voronoi polygons, (2) Create a 500-meter buffer, and (3) Clip the buffer using the voronoi polygons. The worker module accurately executed these tasks by sequentially invoking the appropriate GIS functions."}, {"title": "4.4.2 Case 2: Analyze Disaster Impact Buffers", "content": "In this case, we demonstrate how the planner and worker modules execute a disaster impact buffer analysis. The task involves creating multiple concentric buffers around the disaster area to analyze potential impact zones and performing spatial analysis on the roads within the affected area."}, {"title": "4.5 Ablation Study of Planner Agent", "content": "In this section, we conduct ablation experiments on the planner agent module to explore its role and impact within the ShapefileGPT. The experiment is designed to assess the planner's performance in guiding the worker module, with particular focus on changes in success rate and task execution efficiency. Table 5 summarizes the experimental results across various configurations."}, {"title": "4.6 Ablation Study of Worker Few Shot Prompting", "content": "We conducted ablation studies on the worker prompts in ShapefileGPT, specifically examining how the task example in the worker system prompts and the API Example in the documentation influence task execution performance. In this experiment, the task example refers to a pre-input few-shot task example embedded in the worker system prompts, similar to a preloaded conversation example. The API example refers to a few-shot examples provided for each function in the API documentation, designed to guide the worker in generating accurate function calls.\nIn the experiment, we sequentially removed the task example from the worker system prompts and the API example from the documentation, and tested the entire dataset. The experimental results, presented in Table 6, show that as prompts are removed, the model's overall performance declines in terms of accuracy and success rate, while the repetition rate of function calls increases.\nSpecifically, when the task example was removed, worker accuracy fell from 88.10% to 71.43%, and the success rate dropped from 92.86% to 78.57%. Similarly, when the API example was removed, worker accuracy decreased to 85.71%, and the success rate fell to 88.10%. Notably, across all experiments, the function call parameter accuracy remained at 100%, indicating that even with fewer prompts, the worker's understanding and generation of function parameters remained consistent. However, with fewer prompts, the function call repetition rate increased, particularly when all prompts were removed, rising to 0.1278, compared to 0.0566 with full prompts.\nOverall, these findings indicate that the task example and API example prompts significantly enhance the worker's task execution ability and function call efficiency, while the absence of these prompts leads to a notable decline in system performance. Specifically, the pre-provided task and function call examples play a crucial role in guiding the worker's reasoning, reducing unnecessary function call repetitions, and ultimately improving overall system performance. These results provide valuable insights for designing prompts in future iterations."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "Specialization and Modularity The key advantage of a multi-agent system lies in task division and collaboration. By dividing labor, each agent can focus on specific sub-tasks, enhancing overall task efficiency and quality. In ShapefileGPT, the planner is responsible solely for task allocation, without concern for execution details, while the worker focuses on task completion. This separation of roles reduces the cognitive load for each agent, optimizing their performance.\nFault Tolerance and Error Recovery In complex GIS operations where errors are likely, the ability to handle errors is critical. Multi-agent systems exhibit greater adaptability in challenging environments. As shown in Table 5, ShapefileGPT configurations with a planner achieve higher success rates. In ShapefileGPT, the planner detects worker failures, retries tasks, and adjusts the order of sub-tasks. This self-correction mechanism allows complex tasks to progress without the need for continuous manual intervention.\nHowever, the limitations of the multi-agent architecture manifest in the following ways.\nIncreased Computational Overhead In a multi-agent system, communication and coordination between agents introduce additional overhead, as observed in ShapefileGPT. For multi-step GIS operations, the planner interacts with the worker multiple times, resulting in delays and increased token usage.\nComplexity in Error Management In a multi-agent system, communication and coordination between agents introduce additional overhead, as observed in ShapefileGPT. For multi-step GIS"}, {"title": "5.1 Strengths and Limitations of Multi-Agent Architecture", "content": "operations, the planner interacts with the worker multiple times, resulting in delays and increased token usage.\nAlthough the planner provides error detection and recovery mechanisms, more complex error scenarios may arise. In such cases, despite the planner's best efforts to retry, the worker may repeatedly fail to complete tasks. This is evident in configurations 3 and 4 in Table 5. After the worker model was replaced with GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, task success rates dropped significantly in both configurations due to reduced function-calling capabilities. Configuration 3 exhibited a higher repetition rate than configuration 4, indicating multiple retries by the planner."}, {"title": "5.2 Limitations and Future Improvements", "content": "Hallucinations and Randomness in LLMs Despite their powerful reasoning and generation capabilities, large language models can exhibit hallucinations when handling complex tasks, producing inaccurate or irrelevant information. This issue is particularly pronounced in Shapefile tasks, where geometric and spatial analysis require precise operations and outcomes. Additionally, LLMs' tendency to generate varying outputs under identical configurations introduces uncertainty, potentially causing inconsistencies in automated workflows. This variability increases the need for result validation and presents risks in automating Shapefile processing. Although errors are minimized through supervision and correction within the multi-agent architecture, hallucinations can still impact result accuracy, particularly when processing complex boundaries or irregular data. Future improvements could focus on optimizing the model's context-handling mechanisms to reduce hallucinations.\nToken Consumption ShapefileGPT's operation relies on large language models through API calls, which is efficient but leads to high token consumption, particularly for complex tasks. This results in increased computational costs and financial overhead. As the application scales to handle larger or more complex GIS tasks, the cost issue will become more pronounced. To mitigate this, future strategies could involve incorporating local model inference to optimize token usage and reduce computational expenses, thereby enhancing ShapefileGPT's cost-effectiveness.\nDataset Size For this evaluation, we used a relatively small Shapefile task dataset, focusing on a limited number of geometric operations and spatial queries. This restricted our ability to comprehensively assess the model's performance on more complex and diverse vector data tasks. While ShapefileGPT performed well on the current dataset, this does not fully reflect its applicability to more complex and diverse tasks. Future work should expand the dataset to include more tasks and categories, covering a broader range of operations and query scenarios, to enable a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across diverse applications."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "We proposed ShapefileGPT, a multi-agent framework that enables users to interact with the system using natural language. This framework automatically decomposes Shapefile tasks proposed by users into sub-tasks and completes them through the collaboration of multiple agents. To evaluate the performance of our agents, we created a dataset encompassing multiple task categories, covering common vector data spatial analysis operations. These categories include geometric queries, spatial overlay, buffer analysis, and more, representing classic scenarios in real-world GIS applications.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that ShapefileGPT completes tasks with high accuracy and can effectively call the specialized vector data analysis function modules we designed, ensuring the successful execution of complex spatial analysis tasks. Case studies show that in the multi-agent architecture, the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and planning, while the worker agent handles specific execution. Together, they collaborate efficiently to complete the Shapefile tasks proposed by users. Ablation experiments further validated the independent contributions and importance of each agent module in task execution.\nShapefileGPT not only provides GIS professionals with an efficient automation tool but also significantly lowers the technical barriers for researchers in non-GIS fields to process spatial data, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The design of this versatile framework highlights the broad potential of large language models in handling complex geospatial tasks, offering valuable insights for future agent development in the GIS domain."}]}

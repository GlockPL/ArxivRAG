Works based on this basic AFrepresentation are counted towards abstract argumentation, differ-entiating them from those with additional structural elements, e. g.Weighted Argumentation Frameworks [11], Constrained Argumen-tation Frameworks [10] or Structured Argumentation [16].\nThere exist several different approaches regarding semantics forAFs. Here, we focus on the extension-based approach by whichan argumentation semantics o is a mapping that assigns to an ar-gumentation framework a set of extensions. Alternatives are, e. g.labeling-based semantics [19] and ranking-based semantics [9]. A\u03c3-extension is a set of arguments, which collectively satisfy the con-ditions specified by o e. g. to have no attacks among themselves. [20]proposes a method for combining two argumentation semantics \u03c3, \u03c4into a third we refer to as the 7-vacuous reduct semantics to the baseof \u03c3, vaco (7). The extensions of vaco (7) satisfy two conditions:the base condition, requiring them to be o-extensions, and the vacu-ity condition, demanding there exists no nonempty 7-extension intheir reduct [4]. Given a set of arguments E of an AF F, the reductis the restriction of F to all arguments neither in nor attacked by Eand the attacks among them. The idea of vacuous reduct semantics isto check the reduct for relevant arguments, as specified by the vacu-ity condition 7, and to only accept o-extensions whose reduct provesto contain nothing of interest. For instance, using conflict-free se-mantics for the vacuity condition allows us to ignore the presence ofself-attackers outside of our extension, a problem already mentionedby [15], which has given rise to the class of weak argumentation se-mantics, i. e. semantics violating admissibility in order to address thisand other cases of unacceptable attackers [8, 4, 17]. In Section 3 weextend the work on the undisputed semantics [20] and the semanticsdiscussed in [6] by systematically investigating combinations of dif-ferent admissibility- and conflict-free-based semantics into vacuousreduct semantics.\nA prominent method for evaluating the different argumentation se-mantics is the principle-based analysis [21]. The term \"principle\"refers to a desirable property, although, depending on the use caseintended for a semantics, the principles it should satisfy are subjectto discussion. Apart from the established standard, a number of prin-ciples for weak argumentation semantics, which violate admissibilityby design, have been proposed [5, 7]. In Section 4 we derive generalcriteria for the satisfaction of a selection of principles from both cat-egories by a vacuous reduct semantics.\nOur contributions are as follows.\n\u2022 We give a systematic overview on vacuous reduct semantics re-sulting from combining different admissibility-based and conflict-free semantics (Section 3)\n\u2022 We provide general criteria for principle satisfaction by a vacuousreduct semantics based on its base and vacuity condition (Section4)\n\u2022 We conduct a principle-based analysis for the undisputed seman-tics.

It combines two semantics o and 7 by using one as the base con-dition, which is that only o-extensions are accepted, and one for thevacuity condition, stating that accepted extensions have no nonemptyT-extension in their reduct.\nDefinition 2.

An argumentation semantics o satisfies conflict-freeness if \u0395 \u0395 \u03c3(F) implies E \u2208 cf(F) for every F\u2208 UAF.\nPrinciple 2. An argumentation semantics o satisfies admissibility if\u0395\u0395 \u03c3(F) implies E \u2208 adm(F) for every F\u2208 UAF.\nIn the case of a vacuous reduct semantics vaco (7), the satisfactionof any of these two principles depends heavily on the choice of thebase condition \u03c3.\nProposition 26. Let \u03c3,\u03c4 be argumentation semantics. If o satis-fies conflict-freeness (admissibility), the semantics vaco(T) satisfiesconflict-freeness (admissibility).\nNote that conflict-freeness resp. admissibility of the semantics \u03c3chosen for base condition is only a sufficient, but not a necessarycondition. Although the vacuity condition has no direct influenceon whether an extension is conflict-free, there can be cases wherehe combination of base and vacuity condition results in a conflict-free semantics, while the semantics of the base condition itself isnot conflict-free. We provide an example for a non-conflict-free basecondition here, but the same reasoning applies to admissibility.\nPrinciple 3. A semantics o is context-free if for any F = (A, R), E C A it holds that E \u2208 \u03c3(F) iff for all S C A, E C S :\n\u0395\u0395 \u03c3(Fs).\nExamples of context-free semantics are the admissible and theconflict-free semantics. Complete semantics, on the other hand, isnot context-free. Note that this principle is concerned with restric-tions on the argument set, only, but makes no changes to the attackson the argument set, only, but makes no changes to the attacksbetween the considered arguments. A vacuous reduct semantics isnot context-free by design, unless the vacuity condition is renderedirrelevant by the base condition, i. e. is satisfied whenever the basecondition is satisfied. However, when looking at the base and vacu-ty condition seperately, context-freeness gives us a certain degree ofwell-behavedness.\nProposition 27. Let \u03c3,\u03c4 be argumentation semantics. If vaco(T) isconflict-free and o is context-free, then o is conflict-free.\nWe now turn towards reinstatement [21], for which two very clearsufficient conditions can be given.\nPrinciple 4. An argumentation semantics o satisfies reinstatementif for every F\u2208 UAF E \u2208 \u03c3(F) implies a \u2208 E for all a defendedby E.\nProposition 28.

An argumentation semantics o satisfies modularizationif \u0395 \u2208 \u03c3(F) and E' \u2208 \u03c3(FE) implies EU \u0395\u0384 \u2208 \u03c3(F) for everyFEUAF."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "Since its introduction [1], the principle-based approach has become\nthe base for comparing argumentation semantics against each other.\nIn particular, the works [5, 13, 14] compare their semantics based\non weak admissibility against Dung's admissibility-based semantics\nusing the principle-based approach.

The list of principles discussed here is not exhaustive,\nthough, one may consult [12, 13] for more specific principles related\nto weak argumentation semantics.\nAs the number of new semantics yielded by applying the vacuous\nreduct scheme is quite large, we provide general criteria for prin-\nciple satisfaction based on the two underlying semantics instead of\ndiscussing each semantics separately and only conduct an exemplary\nanalysis for undisputed semantics. In a similar way, [7] focus on re-\nsults concerning principle satisfaction by refute-based semantics in\ngeneral. While not discussed in the original work [2], another class of\nsemantics with well-studied properties are SCC-recursive semantics\n13], due to their common construction scheme of building exten-\nsions subsequently by walking through the strongly connected com-\nponents of the AF. Building on these investigations, the guaranteed\nsatisfaction of certain principles will become a considerable benefit\nof using general construction schemes for semantics, adding to other\nmerits like easing recognizability and comparability of new propos-\nals.

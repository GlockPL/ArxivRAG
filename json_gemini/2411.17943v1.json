This manuscript explores the application of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research approaches to evaluate the per-formance of GenAI models in enhancing scientific writing. Using a hypothetical use case involving a collaborative medical imaging manuscript, we demonstrate how each method provides unique insights into the impact of GenAI. Qualitative methods gather in-depth feedback from expert review-ers, analyzing their responses using thematic analysis tools to capture nuanced improvements and identify limitations. Quantitative approaches employ automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and readability scores, as well as user surveys, to objectively measure improvements in coherence, fluency, and structure. Mixed-methods research integrates these strengths, combining statistical evaluations with detailed qualitative insights to provide a comprehensive assessment. These research methods enable quantifying improvement levels in GenAI-generated content, addressing critical aspects of linguistic quality and technical accuracy. They also offer a robust framework for benchmarking GenAI tools against traditional editing processes, ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of these technologies. By leveraging these methodologies, researchers can evaluate the performance boost driven by GenAI, refine its applications, and guide its responsible adoption in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific research.

In the evaluation of GenAI-generated content, qualitative methods provide rich insights into the contextual relevance, creativity, and usability of the generated text. Techniques such as thematic analysis, interviews, and focus groups allow researchers to gather in-depth feedback from users or domain experts about the quality, coherence and perceived usefulness of the content. For instance, qualitative evaluations can uncover whether a generated medical summary is understandable and actionable for healthcare practitioners or patients. While qualitative methods excel at capturing nuanced feedback and identifying gaps that automated metrics might overlook, they can be time-consuming and may introduce subjectivity or bias based on the participants or evaluatorsSarraf and Tofighi [2016], Sarraf et al.

In the context of GenAI evaluation, quantitative methods often rely on automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity to assess linguistic similarity, fluency, and coherence. These metrics provide a scalable way to evaluate large datasets of generated content, enabling researchers to compare models or track improvements over iterations. Moreover, statistical analysis of user ratings or survey responses can quantify user satisfaction and engagement with the outputs.

A group of scientists has collaboratively written a manuscript where each section reflects the individual writing style of its contributor. The resulting manuscript lacks language coherence, readability, and overall consistency. GenAI is used to polish the original manuscript, aiming to improve its linguistic quality while preserving technical accuracy. Each research method is applied to evaluate the manuscript before and after the intervention by GenAI."}, {"title": "3.1 Qualitative Research Design", "content": "In a qualitative research design, expert reviewers, such as journal editors or senior scientists in medical imaging, are engaged to evaluate the manuscript before and after it has been polished using GenAI. These reviewers are asked to answer several open-ended questions, such as: 1. How well does the revised manuscript achieve language coherence? 2. Are there any improvements in readability and professional tone? 3. Does the revised manuscript maintain the technical accuracy of the content? 4. Are there any sections where the GenAI intervention introduced issues or over-simplifications?\nAfter providing their responses, reviewers participate in semi-structured interviews to elaborate on their observations. Their answers and interview transcripts are analyzed using qualitative analysis software, such as NVivo or MAXQDA, to identify patterns and themes. This approach captures nuanced insights into how effectively GenAI harmonizes writing styles while preserving the scientific integrity of the content. Data analysis focuses on recurring themes like improved flow, reduced ambiguities, and potential areas where GenAI might have detracted from the manuscript's technical precision."}, {"title": "3.2 Quantitative Research Design", "content": "A quantitative approach involves using objective metrics to measure the improvement in the manuscript's quality after being polished by GenAI. Automated tools such as Grammarly or readability indices (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid scores) are used to evaluate aspects like grammatical accuracy, sentence structure, and overall readability. Additionally, a survey with a Likert scale is distributed to a group of independent readers, including scientists and non-experts, to rate the coherence, fluency, and comprehensibility of the manuscript on a numerical scale. Statistical analysis, such as paired t-tests or ANOVA, is applied to compare the ratings and metrics before and after GenAI intervention, providing quantitative evidence of the tool's impact."}, {"title": "3.3 Mixed-Methods Research Design", "content": "In a mixed-methods design, both qualitative and quantitative approaches are combined to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the manuscript's transformation. Automated tools are first used to assess grammatical accuracy and readability, generating quantitative metrics. These results are then supplemented by qualitative feedback from expert reviewers, who are asked to answer specific questions about the coherence, readability, and technical accuracy of the revised manuscript. Following this, reviewers are interviewed to gain deeper insights into their responses.\nThe qualitative data from the interviews and questionnaires are analyzed using software tools such as NVivo or MAXQDA to identify themes and patterns in the reviewers' perspectives. For instance, the software might highlight areas where reviewers consistently agree that GenAI improved readability but note concerns about potential oversimplification of technical content. The qualitative insights are then integrated with the quantitative findings to provide a more holistic evaluation, highlighting both the measurable improvements and the nuanced aspects of GenAI's performance.

By emphasizing depth and context, qualitative methods capture aspects of content quality that automated metrics might overlook.\nQuantitative methods, on the other hand, offer scalability and objectivity in evaluating GenAI-generated content. Automated metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and readability scores provide clear, replicable measures of improvement in language coherence, fluency, and structure. Surveys with numerical ratings further quantify user satisfaction and engagement, enabling researchers to perform statistical analyses to determine the significance of improvements. While quantitative methods may not capture the intricacies of content quality, they excel at providing large-scale comparisons, making them indispensable for assessing the generalizability of GenAI improvements.\nMixed-methods approaches integrate the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research, offering a balanced framework for evaluating GenAI. By combining objective metrics with detailed expert feedback, mixed-methods research captures both the measurable improvements and the nuanced impacts of GenAI-generated content. This approach is particularly effective for evaluating complex outputs, such as scientific manuscripts, where both technical accuracy and linguistic quality are critical. Mixed-methods research ensures that evaluations are not only comprehensive but also contextually relevant, providing actionable insights for both developers and end-users.\nAt this stage of GenAI's evolution, these methodological approaches are crucial for quantifying the level of improvement driven by content and summary generators. GenAI tools are still subject to challenges, including biases, contextual errors, and limitations in handling highly specialized content. Rigorous evaluations help identify these limitations while highlighting areas where GenAI excels. By providing structured, evidence-based assessments, qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research can guide the refinement of GenAI technologies, ensuring that they meet the diverse needs of users across disciplines.\nFurthermore, these approaches allow researchers to benchmark the performance of GenAI tools against traditional writing and editing processes.

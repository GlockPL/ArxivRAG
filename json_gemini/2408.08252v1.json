In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

Their applications extend beyond image generation to include natural language generation (Sahoo et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024; Lou et al., 2023), molecule generation (Jo et al., 2022; Vignac et al., 2022), and biological (DNA, RNA, protein) sequence generation (Avdeyev et al., 2023; Stark et al., 2024), and in each of these domains diffusion models have been shown to be very effective at capturing complex natural distributions. However, in practice, we might not only want to generate realistic samples, but to produce samples that optimize specific downstream reward functions while preserving naturalness by leveraging pre-trained models. For example, in computer vision, we might aim to generate natural images with high aesthetic and alignment scores. In drug discovery, we may seek to generate valid molecules with high QED/SA/docking scores (Lee et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2018) or natural RNAs (such as mRNA vaccines (Cheng et al., 2023)) with high translational efficiency and stability (Castillo-Hair and Seelig, 2021; Asrani et al., 2018), and natural DNAs with high cell-specificity (Gosai et al., 2023; Taskiran et al., 2024; Lal et al., 2024).\nThe optimization of downstream reward functions using pre-trained diffusion models has been approached in various ways. In our work, we focus on non-fine-tuning-based methods because fine-tuning generative models (e.g., when using classifier-free guidance (Ho et al., 2020) or RL-based fine-"}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "Here, we summarize related work. We first outline methods relevant to our goal, categorizing them based on whether they involve fine-tuning. We then discuss related directions, such as discrete diffusion models, where our method excels, and decoding in autoregressive models.\nNon-fine-tuning methods. There are primarily two methods for optimizing downstream functions in diffusion models without fine-tuning.\n\u2022 Classifier guidance (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021; Song et al., 2020): It has been widely used to condition pre-trained diffusion models without fine-tuning. Although these methods do not originally focus on optimizing reward functions, they can be applied for this purpose (Uehara et al., 2024, Section 6.2). In this approach, an additional derivative of a certain value function is incorporated into the drift term (mean) of pre-trained diffusion models during inference. Subsequent variants (e.g., Chung et al. (2022); Ho et al. (2022); Bansal et al. (2023); Guo et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2022); Yu et al. (2023)) have been proposed to simplify the learning of value functions. However, these methods require constructing differentiable models, which limits their applicability to non-differentiable features/reward feedbacks commonly encountered in scientific domains as mentioned in Section 1. Additionally, this approach cannot be directly extended to discrete diffusion models in a principle way 2. Our approach aims to address these challenges.\n\u2022 Best-of-N: The naive way is to generate multiple samples and select the top samples based on the reward functions, known as best-of-K in the literature on (autoregressive) LLMs (Stiennon et al., 2020; Nakano et al., 2021; Touvron et al., 2023; Beirami et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023). This approach is significantly less efficient than ours, as our method uses soft-value functions that predict how intermediate noisy samples lead to high rewards in the future. We validate this experimentally in Section 6.\nFine-tuning of diffusion models. Several methods exist for fine-tuning generative models to optimize downstream reward functions, such as classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2022) and RL-based fine-tuning (Fan et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023)/its variants (Dong et al., 2023). However, these approaches often come with caveats, including high computational costs and the risk of easily forgetting pre-trained models. In our work, we propose an inference-time technique that eliminates the need for fine-tuning generative models, similar to classifier guidance.\nDiscrete diffusion models. Based on seminal works Austin et al. (2021); Campbell et al. (2022), recent work on masked diffusion models (Lou et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2024; Sahoo et al., 2024) has demonstrated their strong performance in natural language generation. Additionally, they have been applied to biological sequence generation (e.g., DNA, protein sequences in Campbell et al. (2024); Sarkar et al. (2024)). In these cases, the use of diffusion models over autoregressive models is particularly apt, given that many biological sequences ultimately adopt complex three-dimensional structures. We also note that ESM3 (Hayes et al., 2024), a widely recognized foundational model in protein sequence generation, bears similarities to masked diffusion models.\nDespite its significance, it cannot be integrated with standard classifier guidance because adding a continuous gradient to a discrete objective is not inherently valid. Unlike standard classifier guidance, our algorithm can be seamlessly applied to discrete diffusion models.\nDecoding in autoregressive models with rewards. The decoding strategy, which dictates how sentences are generated from the model, is a critical component of text generation in autoregressive language models (Wu et al., 2016; Chorowski and Jaitly, 2016; Leblond et al., 2021). Recent studies have explored inference-time techniques for optimizing downstream reward functions Dathathri et al. (2019); Yang and Klein (2021); Qin et al. (2022); Mudgal et al. (2023); Zhao et al. (2024); Han et al. (2024). While there are similarities between these works and ours, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work has extended such methodologies to diffusion models. Furthermore, our approach leverages characteristics unique to diffusion models that are not present in autoregressive models such as SVDD-PM."}, {"title": "3 Preliminaries and Goal", "content": "In this section, we describe the standard method for training diffusion models and outline the objective of our work: optimizing downstream reward functions given pre-trained diffusion models.\n3.1 Diffusion Models\nIn diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2020), our goal is to learn a sampler \\(p(x_c) \\in [C \\rightarrow \\Delta(X)]\\) given data consisting of \\((x, c) \\in X \\times C\\). For instance, in text-to-image diffusion models, c is a text, and x is an image. In protein inverse folding, c is a backbone protein structure, and x is a protein sequence.\nThe training process for a standard diffusion model is summarized as follows. First, we introduce a (fixed) forward process \\(q_t : X \\rightarrow \\Delta(X)\\). Now, after introducing the forward process, we aim to learn a backward process: \\(\\{p_t\\}\\) where each \\(p_t\\) is \\(X \\times C \\rightarrow \\Delta(X)\\) so that the induced distributions induced by the forward process and backward process match marginally. For this purpose, by parametrizing the backward processes with \\(\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\), we typically use the following loss function:\n\\(E_{x_{1},...,x_{T}\\sim q(x_{0})} \\Bigg[-\\log p_{\\theta} (x_{0}|x_{1}) + \\sum_{t=1}^{T} KL(q_{t}(\\cdot | x_{t-1}) ||p_{t}(\\cdot | x_{t+1}, C; \\theta)) + KL(q_{T}(\\cdot)||p_{T}(\\cdot))\\Bigg],\\)\nwhich is derived from the variational lower bound of the negative likelihood (i.e., ELBO).\nHere are two examples of concrete parameterizations. Let \\(\\alpha_t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) be a noise schedule.\nExample 1 (Continuous space). When \\(X\\) is Euclidean space, we typically use the Gaussian distribution \\(q_t(\\cdot | x) = \\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}x, (1 - \\alpha_t))\\). Then, the backward process is parameterized as\n\\[\\mathcal{N}\\Bigg(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}(1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_{t+1})x_t + \\sqrt{\\alpha_{t+1} - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_{\\theta}(x_t, c; \\theta)}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}, \\frac{(1 - \\alpha_t)(1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\Bigg)\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod_{i=1}^{t}\\alpha_i\\). Here, \\(x_{\\theta}(x_t, c; \\theta)\\) is a neural network that predicts \\(x_0\\) from \\(x_t\\) (i.e., \\(\\mathbb{E}[x_0 | x_t, c]\\)).\nExample 2 (Discrete space in Sahoo et al. (2024); Shi et al. (2024)). Let \\(X\\) be a space of one-hot column vectors \\(\\{x \\in \\{0, 1\\}^K : : \\sum_{i=1}^K X_i = 1\\}\\), and Cat\\(\\pi\\) be the categorical distribution over K classes with probabilities given by \\(\\pi \\in \\Delta^K\\) where \\(\\Delta^K\\) denotes the K-simplex. A typical choice is \\(q_t(x) = Cat(\\alpha_t x + (1 - \\alpha_t) m)\\) where \\(m = [0, \\dots, 0, Mask]\\). Then, the backward process is parameterized as\n\\[\\begin{cases}\nCat(x_t), & \\text{if } x_t \\neq m\\\\\nCat\\left(\\frac{(1 - \\alpha_{t-1})m + (\\alpha_{t-1} - \\bar{\\alpha}_t)x_{\\theta}(x_t, c; \\theta)}{1 - \\alpha_t}\\right), & \\text{if } x_t = m.\n\\end{cases}\\]\nHere, \\(x_{\\theta}(x_t, c; \\theta)\\) is a neural network that predicts \\(x_0\\) from \\(x_t\\). Note that when considering a sequence of L tokens \\((x_{1:L}^t)\\), we use the direct product: \\(p_t(x_{1:L}^t | x_{1:L}^{t+1}, c) = \\prod_{l=1}^L p_t(x_l^t | x_l^{t+1}, c)\\).\nAfter learning the backward process, we can sample from a distribution that emulates training data distribution (i.e., \\(p(x|c)\\)) by sequentially sampling \\(\\{p_t\\}_{t=T}^0\\) from \\(t = T\\) to \\(t = 0\\).\nNotation. The notation \\(\\delta_a\\) denotes a Dirac delta distribution centered at a. The notation \\(\\propto\\) indicates that the distribution is equal up to a normalizing constant. With slight abuse of notation, we often denote \\(p_T(\\cdot)\\) by \\(p_T(\\cdot)\\).\n3.2 Objective: Generating Samples with High Rewards While Preserving Naturalness\nWe consider a scenario where we have a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained using the loss function explained in Section 3.1. These pre-trained models are typically designed to excel at characterizing the natural design space (e.g., image space, biological space, or chemical space) by emulating the extensive training dataset. Our work focuses on obtaining samples that also optimize downstream reward functions \\(r : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) (e.g., QED and SA in molecule generation) while maintaining the naturalness by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models. We formalize this goal as follows."}, {"title": "4 Soft Value-Based Decoding in Diffusion Models", "content": "In this section, we first present the motivation behind developing our new algorithm. We then introduce our algorithm, which satisfies desired properties, i.e., the lack of need for fine-tuning or constructing differentiable models.\n4.1 Key Observation\nWe introduce several key concepts. First, for \\(t \\in [T + 1, \\dots, 1]\\), we define the soft value function:\n\\(v_{t-1}(x_{t}) := \\alpha \\log \\mathbb{E}_{p_{t}^{\\text{pre}}}[e^{r(x_{0})/\\alpha} | x_{t} = x],\\)\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{E}_{\\{p_{t}^{\\text{pre}}\\}}[\\cdot]\\) is induced by \\(\\left\\{p_{t}^{\\text{pre}}(x_{t-1}|x_{t+1},c)\\right\\}_{t=T}^{0}\\). This value function represents the expected future reward at \\(t = 0\\) from the intermediate noisy state at \\(t-1\\). Next, we define the following soft optimal policy (denoising process) \\(p_t^* : X \\times C \\rightarrow \\Delta(X)\\) weighted by value functions \\(v_{t-1} : X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\):\n\\[p_t^{\\alpha}(x_t, c) = \\frac{p_t^{\\text{pre}}(x_t, c) \\exp(v_{t-1}(x_t)/\\alpha)}{\\int p_t^{\\text{pre}}(x_t, c) \\exp(v_{t-1}(x)/\\alpha) dx}\\]\nHere, we refer to \\(v_t\\) as soft value functions, \\(p_t^*\\) as soft optimal policies, respectively, because they literally correspond to soft value functions and soft optimal policies where we embed diffusion models into entropy-regularized MDPs, as demonstrated in Uehara et al. (2024).\nWith this preparation in mind, we utilize the following key observation:\nTheorem 1 (From Theorem 1 in Uehara et al. (2024)). The distribution induced by \\(\\{p_{t}^*(x_{t+1},c)\\}_{t=T}^{0}\\) is the target distribution \\(p^{(\\alpha)}(x|c)\\), i.e.,\n\\[p^{(\\alpha)}(x_0 /c) = \\int \\left\\{ \\prod_{t=T+1}^0 p_t^*(x_{t-1} /x_{t}, c) \\right\\} dx_{1:T}.\\]\nWhile Uehara et al. (2024) presents this theorem, they use it primarily to interpret their RL-based fine-tuning introduced in Fan et al. (2023); Black et al. (2023). In contrast, our work explores how to convert this into a new fine-tuning-free optimization algorithm.\nOur motivation for a new algorithm. Theorem 1 states that if we can hypothetically sample from \\(\\{p_t^*\\}_{t=T}^0\\), we can sample from the target distribution \\(p^{(\\alpha)}(x)\\). However, there are two challenges in sampling from each \\(p_t^*:\\)\n1. The soft-value function \\(v_{t-1}\\) in \\(p_t^*\\) is unknown.\n2.

SVDD iterates IS and resampling at each team step locally, but our algorithm can be combined with the more sophisticated global resampling method known as particle filter method (i.e., sequential Monte Carlo) (Del Moral and Doucet, 2014; Kitagawa, 1993; Doucet et al., 2009). Although we do not recommend this approach in practice due to its difficulty in parallelization, we discuss its extension in Section A.\nApplication to fine-tuning.

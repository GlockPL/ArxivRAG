Boasting exceptional computing prowess, these high-end GPUs offer a substantial reduction in training time by approximately 50% in comparison to the A100 series, thereby facilitating a remarkable acceleration in model iteration and debugging processes. Notably, a cluster architecture comprising 8 nodes is sufficiently capable of efficiently completing the training cycle of a 7 billion parameter (7B) model within a single day, significantly narrowing the timeline from experimentation to deployment. Furthermore, the strategic selection and implementation of cluster management software is paramount, as they serve as the cornerstone for ensuring efficient resource allocation, scheduling, and the overall stability of cluster operations.

For large-scale infernece tasks, a strategic selection of high-performance GPUs, such as the RTX 4090 and A100, offers a flexible solution. Additionally, the adaptability of resource allocation mechanisms is crucial, necessitating the dynamic adjustment of deployment strategies in response to actual demands, thereby striking a balance between computational requirements and cost-effectiveness. It is noteworthy that while GPUs undeniably excel in accelerating LLM inference, CPUs can likewise contribute as viable computing resources in select scenarios. In particular, when real-time constraints are less stringent and cost containment is a primary concern, leveraging multi-core CPUs for distributed inference deployment emerges as a viable alternative that merits further exploration.

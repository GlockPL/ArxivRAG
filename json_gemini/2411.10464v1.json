{"title": "Detection of Student Disengagement in Online Classes Using Deep Learning: A Review", "authors": ["Ahmed Mohamed", "Mostafa Ali", "Shahd Ahmed", "Nouran Hani", "Mohammed Hisham", "Meram Mahmoud"], "abstract": "Student Engagement was first introduced in the educational context in the 1980s, to understand and address issues such as student boredom and dropout rates, as discussed in Newmann's study that conceptualized student engagement. One of the challenges is the lack of students' participation in the classes which is part of learning disengagement.[1]\n\nAxelson and Flick defined Student engagement as: \"How involved or interested students appear to be in their learning and how connected they are to their classes, their institutions, and each other\" [2]. This concept has been supported by a survey conducted on high school students, which found a direct positive relationship between student engagement and academic performance, as the more the student engaged in the study material, the higher grades they get. [3]\n\nAs the definition of engagement has become more complex, it has been divided into various components. One model, according to Fredric Categorization of learners engagement[4], divides engagement into three components: behavioral, cognitive, and emotional. Similarly, Bosch divides engagement into three categories: affective, behavioral, and cognitive.[5] In contrast, Anderson's research expanded the components of engagement to include behavioral, cognitive, academic, and psychological dimensions [6]\n\nIn conclusion, based on several readings, learner engagement can be defined as the feelings that drive actions reflecting a student's interest in academic material. These actions include both individual and peer activities, occurring in both classroom settings and extracurricular activities.\n\nNow, Online learning faces different challenges, one of which is the lack of student participation in classes leading to disengage in the session and drop out from the learning process. [7] This lack of engagement was observed during the shifting to online education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic when online learning had become the new norm of education especially after the closure of educational institutions in over 200 countries.[8]\n\nAssessing and measuring student engagement during class is a key factor in solving the problem of disengagement, particularly in online settings. It enables educators to track the attention levels of their students [9]. Methods for measuring student engagement can be categorized into three main types based on the level of learner involvement in the detection process: automatic, semi-automatic, and manual.[10]\n\nIn our literature, we are concerned about the manual assessment of student engagement using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, with a focus on Deep Learning models.\n\nWe have collected relevant studies after using this search string (\"learners\" OR \"students\") AND (\"online learning\" OR \"online education\") AND (\"Engagement Assessment\" OR \"Engagement Tracking\" OR \"Disengagement Detection\") AND (\"computer vision\" OR \"Deep learning\") -which was created and subsequently applied to the Google Scholar database for searching titles and abstracts to find relevant articles.\n\nIn order to set our inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection we have followed Cooper's guidelines, [11] :", "sections": [{"title": "Inclusion criteria:", "content": "Language: Studies must be written in English.\nStudy type: Accepted study types include\nempirical studies (full articles, papers, notes,\nextended abstracts, and work-in-progress papers).\nPeer-Reviewed: Studies should have undergone\npeer review.\nFocus: Studies must exclusively focus on Online\nLearning.\nLength: A minimum of four pages is required.\nEngagement Focus: Research must explicitly\nfocus on learners' engagement in Online Learning,\noffering insights into enhancing engagement or\ndeepening the understanding of the topic.\nPublication date: Studies published between\nJanuary 1, 2013, and November 1, 2023, are\neligible."}, {"title": "Exclusion criteria:", "content": "Non-English Language: Studies not written in\nEnglish are excluded.\nIrrelevant Source Types: Blog posts, magazine\narticles, theses, newsletters, and literature review\narticles or papers do not meet the inclusion criteria.\nRepetition by Same Authors: Repeated\ncontributions by the same authors in journal articles\nand conference papers are not eligible."}, {"title": "", "content": "The search process initially identified 272 studies,\nbut after applying our exclusion and inclusion criteria, only\n72 study met our criteria. We have established a CSV\u00b9\nspreadsheet to systematically gather excerpts from all these\nstudies, organizing the information in rows and columns.\nEach row provided a summary of the data extracted from\neach study, while the columns detailed the types of data\nbeing extracted. These columns typically included\ninformation such as the title, author, publication year,\narticle or paper type, and other relevant data. Furthermore,\nwe have chosen out of the 72 study only 38 study\u00b2 after\nreviewing the results once more."}, {"title": "", "content": "In our research, we are concerned about utilizing AI\nfor assessing engagement, particularly focusing on\ncomputer vision techniques due to their ease of use and the\nwidespread availability of low-cost cameras. Additionally,\nwe are exploring the use of affective computing techniques,\nwhich closely resemble teacher observations and do not\ndisrupt the learning process for the students during the\nsession.\n\nAs stated, 38 papers from our results were found that\ndepend on computer vision. These papers presented various\napproaches for detecting disengagement, along with\ndifferent methods and models, which will be discussed\nbelow.\n\nWe examined the collected research to gather answers\nto our research questions, which are as follows:\n1.Which methods or technologies are used to assess\nstudents' engagement?\n2.Which indicators or specific acts are assessed to\ndetect disengagement?\n\nAdditionally, we gathered demographic information\nabout the studies. The studies were published from 2014 to\nthe present date, with the year 2023 having the highest\npublications count Figure 2. The major focus of these studies\nwas on students, with sample sizes ranging from 19 to 432\nstudents. Their ages vary between 17 to 29 years. A detailed\ndescription of every paper sample was added to the studies\ndata sheet mentioned earlier."}, {"title": "", "content": "Computer vision-based models offer various ways\nto assess learners' engagement, with the most common\nmodalities being facial expressions, gestures, postures, and\neye movements. Out of 37 papers investigated, 21 of them\nfocused on facial expressions. Figure [3] Therefore, we can\ncategorize the approaches into two main groups: Face-\ndependent and Face-independent Figure [4]."}, {"title": "", "content": "Face-dependent assessments can be further divided\ninto two types: part-based indicators and appearance-based\nindicators. Part-based indicators concentrate on specific\nfacial features such as eyes and mouth. The Facial Action\nCoding System (FACS) is utilized to analyze different facial\nparts, referred to as Action Units (AUs), which represent the\nmovements of facial muscles. These units are used to measure\nspecific emotions [12]. These emotions then reflect the level\nof student engagement with the learning material.\n\nIn [13] and [14], an open-source toolkit called\nOpenFace 2.0 is employed for various tasks, including\ndetecting face landmarks, recognizing a set of Action Units\n(AUs), tracking eye gaze, and positioning the head. Using this\ntechnology, 30 features are extracted from video frames of\nstudents. Subsequently, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\ndeep neural network is used to process the data and detect\nengagement in a time series model.\n\nAppearance-based models, on the other hand, rely\non extracting features from the entire face and generating\npatterns for engagement classification. In [15], a lightweight\nattentional convolutional neural network (CNN) is\nintroduced for face expression recognition. This model\nrecognizes four main expressions, each of which is assigned\na weight and contributes to the assessment of engagement\nbased on specific thresholds and equations, dependent on a\ntrained CNN model.\n\nIn our literature, approximately 10 studies have\nfocused on indicators that are not directly related to facial\nexpressions but rather on user activities during the session,"}, {"title": "", "content": "such as mouse activity or user posture. In [16] and [17],\nlearner's mouse activity is integrated with their gaze during\nthe session and used to train Al models for detecting learner\ndisengagement in online settings. The first study employed a\nCNN model trained to establish a connection between mouse\nactivity and gaze, while the other study used data from a\ntrained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze\nuser mouse activity in a learning session to detect\ndisengagement. They achieved this using their dataset of\ncomputer users' mouse activities during specific tasks.\n\nIn another study [18], the activity data of 360\nstudents within the e-learning platform was collected and\nsummarized into eight features, which included Total Logins,\nActivity inside the content area, Number of Clicks, Join\nSession, User Activity Group, Time Spent, Total Items, and\nTime Spent in Session Attendance. Subsequently, this labeled\ndata was used as input for two models: an SVM model and\nan Artificial Neural Network."}, {"title": "", "content": "Based on our review, we have not found yet any\nstudies that specifically illustrate the level of engagement of\nlearners based on their drowsiness status. As mentioned\nearlier [10], drowsiness is considered one of the most\nsignificant indicators of disengagement during online\nlearning. Using various deep learning models, our goal is to\nintroduce an innovative framework for assessing student\nengagement by considering both facial expressions and\ndrowsiness status. This model is proposed as a web app\nsolution for instructors and education providers, which will\nassist them in continuously monitoring their learners' levels\nof engagement."}]}

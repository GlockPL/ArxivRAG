Despite advancements in understanding these rhythms and predict-\ning circadian phases at the transcriptional level, predicting circadian phases\nfrom proteomic data remains elusive. This challenge is largely due to the\nscarcity of time labels in proteomic datasets, which are often characterized\nby small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and significant noise. Further-\nmore, existing methods for predicting circadian phases from transcriptomic\ndata typically rely on prior knowledge of known rhythmic genes, making\nthem unsuitable for proteomic datasets. To address this gap, we developed\na novel computational method using unsupervised deep learning techniques\nto predict circadian sample phases from proteomic data without requiring\ntime labels or prior knowledge of proteins or genes. Our model involves a\ntwo-stage training process optimized for robust circadian phase prediction:\nan initial greedy one-layer-at-a-time pre-training which generates informative\ninitial parameters followed by fine-tuning. During fine-tuning, a specialized\nloss function guides the model to align protein expression levels with cir-\ncadian patterns, enabling it to accurately capture the underlying rhythmic\nstructure within the data. We tested our method on both time-labeled and\nunlabeled proteomic data. For labeled data, we compared our predictions to\nthe known time labels, achieving high accuracy, while for unlabeled human\ndatasets, including postmortem brain regions and urine samples, we explored\ncircadian disruptions.

Introduction", "content": "Circadian rhythms, driven by an internal molecular clock, regulate phys-\niological and behavioral processes. Disruptions to these rhythms have been\nassociated with various pathologies, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and\nneurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Hence,\nstudying these rhythms is crucial due to their significant impact on health\nand disease.\nIn mammals, cell-autonomous circadian rhythms are driven by intercon-\nnected transcriptional-translational feedback loops. Additionally, substantial\ncontributions to circadian processes come from posttranslational and post-\ntranscriptional regulation [7, 8]. While the majority of research in the field\nof chronobiology has focused on the rhythmic expression at the mRNA level,\nunderstanding circadian rhythmicity at the protein level remains limited.\nThis limitation is noteworthy given the acknowledged contribution of post-\ntranscriptional mechanisms to circadian rhythms at the protein level [9, 10].\nObtaining precise sample times is currently essential for analyzing cir-\ncadian rhythms in proteomic data. However, many datasets, particularly\nhuman samples, often lack labeled timestamps due to constraints imposed\nby health risks in collection protocols or the inability to collect precise sam-\nple times (e.g., time of death). This lack of time labels poses an urgent\nneed for computational methods to predict the phase of each sample. Chal-\nlenges arise in developing such methods due to several factors. Firstly, these\ndatasets often contain small sample sizes with high dimensionality and signif-\nicant noise. Moreover, the presence of proteins with periods shorter than 24\nhours, i.e., ultradian rhythms, adds complexity. These challenges cannot be\neffectively tackled using conventional statistical or machine learning methods.\nThe rapid advances in deep learning techniques offer promise for overcoming\nthese challenges and estimating the circadian phase of each sample. While\nefforts have been made at the mRNA level [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], there\nis a notable gap in research concerning the prediction of circadian phases in\nproteomic data."}, {"title": "2.

Discussion", "content": "To study circadian rhythms at the protein level, sample times are needed.\nHowever, proteomic datasets, especially in humans, often lack explicit time\nlabels. Other challenges include: the sample sizes are typically very small;\nultradian proteins typically exist; and knowledge of rhythmic proteins are\nlimited. To address these issues, PROTECT has been designed to predict\nsample phases in proteomic data in an unsupervised manner. This method is\nappropriate for different sample sizes and does not require a priori informa-\ntion. The effectiveness of PROTECT was validated through testing on time-\nlabeled datasets, achieving remarkable results with over 80% nAUC on all\ninstances. Our exploration of un-labeled human datasets using PROTECT'S\ntime predictions revealed differences between control and AD subjects in\nthree brain regions and urine samples. Additionally, the study provides po-\ntential drug targets and identifies some ultradian rhythmic proteins in TC.\nPROTECT is generalizable to other circadian omics data types, such as\ntranscriptomic and metabolomic datasets [20, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62],\nas these data types share similar periodic structures. Unlike existing methods\ntailored for transcriptomics, PROTECT does not rely on time information or\npredefined rhythmic features, such as known rhythmic genes or metabolites,\nmaking it broadly applicable to these types of datasets.\nTo validate this, we applied PROTECT to some publicly available cir-\ncadian transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. Specifically, we analyzed\ntranscriptomic data from a mouse liver study [20], which includes both pro-\nteomic and transcriptomic measurements, as well as a baboon amygdala\ndataset [55] and a mouse kidney dataset [56]. Additionally, we evaluated\nmetabolomic data from a mouse liver study [57]. PROTECT successfully\npredicted sample phases across these datasets, with detailed results provided\nin the Supplementary Material (Figure S19). These findings further support\nthe robustness of our method and its potential for broader applications in\ncircadian and diurnal research."}, {"title": "4.1. Rhythmic proteins in human dataset", "content": "On the TC and DLPFC, large portions of proteins are rhythmic in both\ncontrol and AD subjects.

Moreover, in the urine\ndataset, 458, 434, and 387 out of 555 proteins show rhythmic patterns in\ncontrol, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively (Figure S16). This indicates"}, {"title": "4.5. Potential limitations of our approach", "content": "Despite its excellent performance, PROTECT requires further explo-\nration. In our study, we did not address the impact of the postmortem\ninterval (PMI) on postmortem human brain datasets. PMI refers to the du-\nration between the time of death and sample collection, which can influence\nproteomic values. While most samples used in this paper have a PMI of\nless than 10 hours, thus minimally impacting the study, future work should\ninvestigate the effect of PMI on predicted times.\nOne limitation of PROTECT lies in its strategy for handling missing val-\nues within the proteomic dataset. The current practice of excluding proteins\nwith missing values may lead to the exclusion of valuable data that could\ncontribute to a more comprehensive understanding of our investigation. As\nadvances in data collection lead to fewer missing values, we expect that more\nproteins can be incorporated into rhythmicity analysis.\nAlso, to determine which protein should exhibit its peak at time 0 and\nsubsequently arrange the remaining proteins in relation to this target protein,\nwe employed EHD1. This protein showed rhythmicity in all datasets for both\ncontrol and AD subjects. We established the peak value of EHD1 at time\n0 and organized the other proteins relative to EHD1. In the future, with\nmore studies on proteins' peak times, we can use some known proteins as the\ntarget protein.\nBesides potential future enhancements to PROTECT itself, systemati-\ncally investigating these limitations provides broader understanding of the\ndata dependencies and robustness in circadian proteomic modeling. In turn,\nwith further investigation into these practical data constraints alongside algo-\nrithmic advances, PROTECT may significantly influence standardized proto-\ncols for circadian omics analysis, thus enabling more consistent and accurate\nbiological findings."}, {"title": "Data availability statement", "content": "All data used in this paper are publicly available and cited in the paper."}, {"title": "CRediT authorship contribution statement", "content": "Aram Ansary Ogholbake: Conceptualization, Formal Analysis, In-\nvestigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing \u2013 original draft\nQiang Cheng: Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Method-\nology, Supervision, Writing \u2013 review & editing"}]}

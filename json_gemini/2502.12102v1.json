In human society, different types of social relationship exist (e.g., teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors, siblings, and so on) and are associated with distinct sets of prescribed (or proscribed) cooperative functions, including hierarchy, care, transaction, and mating. These relationship-specific patterns of prescription and proscription (i.e., \u201crelational norms\u201d) shape our judgments of what is appropriate or inappropriate for each partner within that relationship. Thus, what is considered ethical, trustworthy, or cooperative within one relational context, such as between friends or romantic partners, may not be considered as such within another relational context, such as between strangers, housemates, or work colleagues. Moreover, what is appropriate for one partner within a relationship, such as a boss giving orders to their employee, may not be appropriate for the other relationship partner (i.e., the employee giving orders to their boss) due to the relational norm(s) associated with that dyad in the relevant context (here, hierarchy and transaction in a workplace context). Now that artificially intelligent \u201cagents\u201d and chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being designed and used to fill certain social roles and relationships that are analogous to those found in human societies (e.g., Al assistant, Al mental health provider, Al tutor, Al \u201cgirlfriend\u201d or \u201cboyfriend\u201d), it is imperative to determine whether or how human-human relational norms will, or should, be applied to human-Al relationships. Here, we systematically examine how Al systems' characteristics that differ from those of humans, such as their likely lack of conscious experience and immunity to fatigue, may affect their ability to fulfill relationship-specific cooperative functions, as well as their ability to (appear to) adhere to corresponding relational norms. We also highlight the \"layered\" nature of human-Al relationships, wherein a third party (the Al provider) mediates and shapes the interaction. This analysis, which is a collaborative effort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and Al researchers, carries important implications for Al systems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that Al systems can offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency in certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy dependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human relationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or implementing) suitable human-Al relational norms\u2014for a wide range of relationship types\u2014will be crucial for ensuring that human-Al interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human well-being.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Much recent discussion of the moral psychology and ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on identifying or forecasting morally relevant properties of Al: for example, asking whether Al may develop the capacity for sentience or agency; if so, how this should affect our treatment of Al; what risks it may bring, and so on (Gibert & Martin, 2021; Birch, 2024). However, it is increasingly recognized that how we (should) interact with Al systems depends not only on the intrinsic properties of such systems, or what we believe these to be (Danaher, 2020), but also on the practical and social aims we have in engaging with Al\u2014where these aims, in turn, often depend upon the context (Kasirzadeh & Gabriel, 2023; Puzio, 2024). For example, what constitutes appropriate use of an Al system in a business context, characterized by one set of cooperative aims, may differ significantly from what constitutes appropriate use of Al in an educational context, characterized by a different set of cooperative aims.\nIn addition to considering the institutional context of human-Al interactions (e.g., business, education, and so on), it is important also to consider the socio-relational context, as this can transcend particular institutions. Socio-relational context can be defined in various ways. For example, it can be used to differentiate interactions occurring between members of an ingroup versus members of an outgroup (Terry & Hogg, 1999; Hester & Gray, 2020). In this paper, we use the term to refer to the specific type of social relationship(s) that exists between two interaction partners as well as the role(s) that each party occupies within said relationship (Clark et al., 2015). The social relationships we have in mind are common dyadic pairs picked out by lay language categories, such as caregiver-patient, teacher-student, two friends, two work teammates, and so on. In other words, we are interested in a source of socio-relational variance that often shapes cooperative dynamics even when both parties are of the same group. To illustrate, how it is appropriate to interact with one's boss, whether inside or outside of the workplace, may differ from how it is appropriate to interact with one's child or spouse, notwithstanding shared group membership (e.g., fellow citizens of a given social class or ethnicity).\nConsideration of such dyadic relational context is necessary, we suggest, because Al-based conversational systems, in addition to being able to perform specific tasks such as answering factual questions or writing lines of code, can now engage in complex and realistic social roleplay with humans (as well as with other Al systems), both spontaneously and as a result of deliberate prompting or programming (Park et al., 2023; Shanahan, McDonell and Reynolds, 2023). The extent and sophistication of this social roleplay ability, including mimicking specific relationship types, is unprecedented in in a nonhuman entity."}, {"title": "Relationships as social context", "content": "The purpose of this paper is to offer a unified theoretical framework for understanding social role-dependent cooperative interactions between humans and conversational Al.\nEncounters with \u201csocial\u201d Al happen against a backdrop of pre-existing social and relational norms which shape our use and expectations of this technology (Coeckelbergh, 2014; Van Wynsberghe, 2022; Shevlin, 2024). When we converse with virtual assistants or interact with service robots, for instance, we (sometimes consciously and sometimes unconsciously) apply familiar social scripts derived from human-human relationships, such as norms of politeness (see Lumer & Buschmeier, 2023), turn-taking, and conversational relevance, as we navigate and make sense of these interactions. However, the specific type of relationship we have with an Al will often influence which norms are applied. Consider the following exchange:\nHuman: I'm feeling incredibly lonely and depressed. I'm really not sure what to do anymore. I don't have anyone I can talk to.\nChatbot: I'm sorry, but we are going to have to change the topic. I won't be able to engage in a conversation about your personal life. I recommend that you investigate other resources for addressing your emotional concerns.\nHow should we judge the chatbot's response in this case? Is it cruel and uncaring? Appropriately professional (Leibo et al., 2024)? How can we determine the answer? And how is the human user likely to feel about receiving such a response? How might it affect their subsequent behavior?\nAlthough many factors will be relevant to answering such questions, an important one, we suggest, is information about the socio-relational role (or associated cooperative functions; see below) the chatbot has been designed, or is being used, to fulfill. If the chatbot is serving in the role of a mental health screener as part of a wellness app, for instance, the response will seem out of line, possibly reflective of a programming error or an incoherent design choice. The user, in turn, might feel surprised, frustrated, or angry, and might contact customer support to complain.\nIf the chatbot is in the role of a math tutor, sales agent, or financial advisor, by contrast, the response might seem more pertinent. Rather than being a sign of something gone wrong, it might instead seem to reflect a well-considered guardrail to keep the discussion focused and to maintain clarity about the purpose and boundaries of the interaction. The user, in this example, might still feel frustrated about the chatbot's unwillingness to pursue a certain line of conversation, but this outcome would likely be easier to understand and accept. Perhaps the user would even feel embarrassed for \u201coversharing\u201d or for having gone to the wrong source for support.\nWith this brief illustration, we stress the theme of our article, which is the need to study, understand, and develop appropriate norms for human-Al interactions, not only in general (e.g., norms of politeness, truthfulness, turn-taking), but also within the context of more specific socio-functional roles and types of human-Al relationships (e.g., caregiver-patient, teacher-student, supervisor-assistant, and so on) (see Reinecke, Kappes et al., 2025).\nTo begin to address this need, we draw on the Relational Norms model recently introduced by Earp and colleagues (Clark, Earp, & Crockett, 2020; Earp, 2021; Earp et al., 2021; Earp et al., 2025). This model builds on prior models of relational norms (primarily Bugental, 2000, and Clark & Mills, 1979 and 2012; see also Fiske, 1992; Rai & Fiske, 2011) and was developed to theorize and measure relationship-specific cooperative norms, as characterized below, for human-human relationships. Here, we explore whether and how these norms might be expected, in practice, to \u201ccarry over\u201d to the human-Al analogues of such relationships (Guingrich & Graziano, 2024), particularly given differences between humans and Al. We also consider the ethical and regulatory implications of such potential carry-over (or lack thereof), since research suggests that how we choose to frame and relate to Al systems can significantly shape relevant law and policy (Maas, 2023).\nThe need for a theoretical, empirical, and ethical investigation of relational norms for human-Al cooperation stems from fast-moving developments. Since the 2022 release of OpenAl's ChatGPT\u2014a chat interface for a general-purpose LLM trained on vast quantities of data pulled from the internet\u2014LLMs equipped with similar conversational interfaces have increasingly been used to perform a wide range of functions associated with particular social or relational roles traditionally filled by humans (Bubeck et al., 2023; Porsdam Mann et al., 2023; Earp, Calcott et al., 2024; Shevlin, 2025). These range from relatively narrow, circumscribed roles such as assistant, medical scribe, gaming opponent, tutor, or work teammate, to broader roles such as life coach, moral advisor, role model, friend, companion (K\u00f6bis et al., 2021), or even\u2014for some users\u2014romantic partner (Pan & Mou, 2024). Furthermore, human-Al communication can exhibit a sense of continuity, with in-depth dialogue, personalized responses, and repeated interactions over time, creating the feeling of an extended \u201crelationship\u201d (Gambino, Fox, & Ratan, 2020)."}, {"title": "The need for a comprehensive approach", "content": "In short, LLM-powered chatbots not only generate broadly human-like responses to relevant prompts from users; they also, increasingly, can convincingly emulate specific human social roles or relationship types. Some of these simulations have the potential to benefit users by helping them meet various personal or professional needs (De Freitas et al., 2024). However, the potential harms of such systems for individuals and societies (Akbulut et al., 2024; Maeda & Quan-Haase, 2024) have not yet been systematically studied (e.g., Zimmerman, Janhonen & Beer, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). In addition to the sheer novelty of the phenomenon to be investigated (namely, the increasing sophistication and availability of LLM-based human social role mimicry), this relative lack of systematic risk-evaluation across human-Al relationship types signals the need for an overarching framework that can adequately motivate and structure such an inquiry.\nHow, then, should Al systems behave in these simulated relationship contexts (and how should humans behave in return)? How will humans make sense of, feel about, and respond to such behavior? Understanding both empirical and ethical aspects of human-Al interactions\u2014specifically, as a function of differing socio-relational roles\u2014will be essential for informing policy, design, and regulation of social Al going forward.\nWe are not the first to argue that studies of human-Al interaction must take relational context into account. However, analyses thus far have proceeded mostly in a piecemeal fashion, drawing on different theoretical or values-based approaches and typically focusing on one type of relational role at a time: for example, Al assistant (Gabriel et al., 2024; Manzini et al., 2024), Al customer service agent (Leoc\u00e1dio et al., 2024); Al financial advisor (Kofman, 2024); Al judge (Constantinescu, 2025); Al mental health provider (Fiske, Henningsen, & Buyx, 2019; Saeidnia et al., 2024; Tavery, 2024), Al moral guide or \u2018guru' (Giubilini & Savulescu, 2018; Constantinescu et al., 2022; Giubilini et al., 2024; Myers & Everett, 2025), Al nanny (Gu\u00e9rin et al. 2025; Fosch-Villaronga et al. 2023), Al friend (Danaher, 2019; Archer, 2021; Ryland, 2021; Brandtzaeg et al., 2022; Nunn & Weijers, 2023), or Al \"girlfriend\u201d or \u201cboyfriend\u201d (Cheok, Karunanayaka, & Zhang, 2017; Depounti, Saukko, & Natalie, 2022; Lin, 2024).\nIn contrast, we suggest that a comprehensive theoretical framework regarding the nature of cooperative relationships is required to assess the full range of socio-relational roles that Al systems are being designed and used to emulate or occupy. Such a framework should enable us to explain and predict underlying processes shaping human-Al interactions that will vary by relationship type, and to anticipate ethical challenges posed by Al systems that will also vary by relationship type."}, {"title": "Wrapping up preliminaries and looking ahead", "content": "There have been a range of attempts to develop frameworks for understanding and fostering ethical human-Al relationships. For example, one proposed framework for studying 'cooperative Al' has drawn on research into \u201cmulti-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms\u201d (Dafoe et al. 2020, abstract; see also Dafoe et al., 2021). However, this work focuses primarily on cooperative interactions between humans and Al-simulated agents in general: that is, irrespective of the particular relational role that each party occupies.\nTaking a different approach, the previously mentioned Relational Norms model of Earp and colleagues (Clark, Earp, & Crockett, 2020; Earp, 2021; Earp et al., 2021; based primarily on Bugental, 2000, and Clark & Mills, 1979, 2012; refined in Earp et al., 2025), builds on prior theoretical and empirical work\u00b2 to show how and why different social relationships shape our behavioral tendencies, cooperative expectations, moral judgments, and judgments of appropriateness or inappropriateness (Leibo et al., 2024), in particular relational contexts (see Section 1 for details). This is crucial because, as we will argue, different relationship types are associated with different kinds of coordination problems (see Curry, 2016). What counts as \"cooperative\u201d behavior therefore often depends on the nature of existing or desired relationship between the parties as well as each party's role within it (Clark et al., 2015; Clark, Earp, & Crockett, 2020).\nSocial Al is trained on linguistic data generated in part through (and/or including information about) a huge volume of human cooperative\u00b3 interactions. Role-specific Al systems or models will thus inevitably learn from, and potentially influence or exploit, the relationship-relative cooperative norms (i.e., relational norms) embedded in such data. Accordingly, a natural starting point for our investigation is to employ an existing framework for understanding and describing such human-human relational norms, and then to map out the most salient or consequential similarities and differences that pertain to analogous human-Al relationships (see Earp, Calcott et al., 2024; Reinecke, Kappes et al., 2025; Kappes et al., in press).\nIn this paper, therefore, we adapt the Relational Norms model to human-Al interactions. Descriptively, we seek to understand how, or to what extent, people are likely to apply existing, human-human relational norms\u2014as defined within the Relational Norms framework-to interactions with Al systems that have been designed, are being used, or are otherwise perceived to emulate specific social-relational roles. For example, will they find it intuitive to \"comfort\u201d an Al friend that is simulating sadness, but awkward to comfort an Al supervisor or teacher? Or will they find it odd to \u201ccomfort\u201d even the Al friend, perhaps believing the Al does not truly feel sad (see Allen & Caviola, 2025, for related work)? We make some high-level predictions in this paper based on existing theory and data; a related empirical research program into such questions is described elsewhere (Reinecke, Kappes et al., 2025).\nPrescriptively, we aim to evaluate how Al systems should be designed, governed, and regulated to maximize benefits and minimize harms, given a range of possibilities for how our theoretical predictions, based on the Relational Norms model, could turn out. Importantly, however, our substantive ethical suggestions do not simply \u201cfall out\u201d of the Relational Norms model. Although in using the model we seek to explain why certain relational norms have arisen in human societies (while also acknowledging cultural variation in how the norms apply between societies), and to show how these norms influence our cooperative expectations and associated moral judgments (for example, when our relationship-specific cooperative expectations are violated), it does not say whether these norms, as implemented in a particular society, are necessarily desirable or whether certain moral judgments are correct.\nIn other words, it is a descriptive model of a set of prescriptive cooperative expectations that people do in fact have for different relationship types; it is not itself a prescriptive ethical theory. Accordingly, when making ethical recommendations in our own voice, we will draw on a range of common normative assumptions (for example, about potential benefits and harms of various policy options) that we expect will be shared by most readers. In so doing, we will try to keep the descriptive (empirical-explanatory) and normative (ethical-prescriptive) aspects of our analysis clearly distinguished. Nevertheless, as will be evident, our ethical and policy recommendations are systematically informed by the Relational Norms model.\nWe consider Al systems that explicitly emulate one or more human social-relational roles, encompassing both embodied robots and disembodied Al such as large language models. While the presence or absence of a physical body can significantly impact interpersonal dynamics (e.g., Lee et al., 2006; Deng, Mutlu, & Mataric, 2019), our framework focuses on the roles these systems occupy in human interactions, regardless of physical manifestation. Finally, despite our focus on dyadic relationships as in the original Relational Norms model-or as adapted here, on two-way interactions between one human and one Al system-we acknowledge that relational norms can apply to one-many relationships, for example, between an individual and a group (Earp et al., 2021; see also, e.g., Dranseika et al. 2018). We also consider the fact that most Al systems, regardless of their emulated relational role, ultimately mediate a background relationship between the human user and the Al company or developer (see the subsection on \u201clayered relationships\u201d below).\nWe begin with an overview of the Relational Norms model as originally developed and applied to the study of human-human relationships (primarily in Earp et al., 2021, with significant model updates as described in Earp et al., 2025, the latter of which we rely on for this paper). We then explore how this model might be extended to human-Al interactions, focusing on the similarities and differences between human and artificial agents in their capacities to engage in cooperative relationships of various types. Next, we examine some of the unique challenges and opportunities that Al systems present in relational context. Finally, we consider the broader implications of our analysis for the design and governance of Al systems and identify key directions for future research."}, {"title": "Section 1: The Relational Norms Model", "content": "Building on the work of previous theorists as noted in the introduction (primarily Bugental, 2000, and Clark & Mills, 1979, 2012; but also related to Hamilton & Sanders, 1981; Fiske, 1992; Haslam & Fiske, 1992; Haidt & Baron, 1996; Rai & Fiske, 2011, Graham et al., 2013, Shweder et al., 2013; Curry, 2016; Curry, Mullins & Whitehouse, 2019), Earp and colleagues recently proposed a Relational Norms model of human moral psychology (Clark, Earp, & Crockett, 2020; Earp, 2021; Earp et al., 2021; updated in Earp et al., 2025). The model shows how different relationship types as identified by lay language categories (such as parent-child, boss-employee, teacher-student, siblings, friends, neighbors, and so on) are each associated with relationship-specific, socially prescribed (or proscribed) \u201ccooperative functions\u201d\u2014or sets of such functions\u2014including (or excluding) hierarchy, care, transaction, and mating.\nThese relationship-specific sets, or patterns, of cooperative prescriptions/proscriptions (i.e., relational norms) serve to guide relationship partners toward mutual benefit (of various kinds, including material, emotional, and so on), not only in one-shot interactions, but often over repeated interactions. Each cooperative function, in turn, is defined by rules (primarily, if-then contingencies; see Bugental, 2000) which, taken together and when followed, represent an efficient, socially accepted solution to a corresponding coordination problem (Earp et al., 2021, 2025; see also Bugental, 2000; Curry, 2016). Further, adhering to the set of cooperative functions that is socially endorsed within a culture for each relationship type not only guides within-relationship behavior, but also allows the interaction partners to side-step a range of possible coordination problems that might otherwise have arisen in that relational context.\nThe key insight of the Relational Norms model is that different types of social relationships are associated with different combinations of cooperative functions, accompanied by norms which can vary both in \u201cdirection\u201d\u2014i.e., the norms may be either prescriptive or proscriptive-and in relative strength. These relationship-specific sets of cooperative expectations, or relational norm profiles, shape our moral judgments and emotions regarding behaviors that meet, fail to meet, violate, or exceed those expectations within the given relationship type (Earp et al., 2021; Earp et al., 2025). Unsurprisingly, therefore, one and the same action might be judged very differently (e.g., as cooperative or non-cooperative) depending on the relationship within which it occurs.\nFor example, making a sexual comment that relies on intimate personal details may be regarded as acceptable or even desirable within a nonhierarchical relationship characterized by positive norms for care and mating (e.g., a romantic relationship), but will be seen as objectionable in a hierarchical employment relationship characterized by positive transaction norms and negative norms for mating (e.g., a boss-employee relationship). Omissions can be similarly analyzed: for example, failure to feed a hungry individual when one could easily have done so will generally be harshly judged if one is a parent and the hungry individual is one's own child (i.e., a relationship defined by both hierarchy and care, with stronger caregiving responsibilities for the person in the dominant role), but less harshly, or even neutrally or positively, if one is a restaurant owner and the individual is a non-paying customer (i.e., a nonhierarchical relationship characterized primarily by transaction) (but see Marshall et al., 2022, on how some such judgments vary as a function both of development and culture).\nIn romantic partnerships, strong mutual care norms are combined with mating norms and (in egalitarian societies) weak or negative hierarchy norms, leading to more symmetrical expectations of caring behaviors. Partners are expected to be mutually responsive to one another's needs, each contributing according to their ability without too severely sacrificing their own well-being (Lemay et al., 2007; see also Earp & Savulescu, 2020, for details and caveats). In close friendships, care norms are also characteristic but may be somewhat less strong (or more domain-limited). Both friendships and romantic partnerships are often also simultaneously characterized by avoidance of following a transaction norm (Clark & Mills, 1979; Clark, 1984). Friendships are also often characterized by avoidance of following a mating norm. There is, however, variability in these patterns such that among some people, especially people with insecure attachments, both care and transaction norms may be applied to relationships labeled as friendships or romantic partnerships (Bartz & Lydon, 2006). Similarly, friendships can sometimes evolve into romantic partnerships or \u201cfriends with benefits\" arrangements (see Lehmiller et al., 2011). In any case, as a result of how cooperative norms are or are not applied to a given relationship type, a given behavior in the context of that relationship\u2014such as staying home to care for another person\u2014might be seen as praiseworthy but not obligatory in one category of relationship (e.g., friendships), whereas similar actions might be normatively expected in other categories of relationships (e.g., parent-child relationships or long-term romantic partnerships).\nThese examples highlight that the cooperative functions that are prescriptively associated with a given relationship type in a given context combine and interact to influence how actions within the relationship are morally judged and emotionally processed or responded to. They also are subject to individual differences (e.g., in personal endorsement of norms within or across different relationship types; see e.g., Eisenberger, Lynch, Aselage, & Rohdiek, 2004; Amormino, Ploe, & Marsh, 2022; see also between-participant variability in patterns of relational norm endorsement in Earp et al., 2021, 2025). Moreover, these norms do not apply in an \"all or none\" manner to specific relationship types (cf. Mills et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2016). Rather, each type of social relationship is expected to serve, or not to serve, one or more cooperative functions to a greater or lesser extent, either chronically or in particular situations (Earp et al. 2021; Earp, 2021; Earp, Calcott et al., 2024).\nBy measuring relational norms in a US sample for various different types of relationships, focusing on chronic associations, Earp et al. (2021; 2025) showed that these norms could be used to predict downstream moral judgments (out of sample) of a range of behaviors in different relational contexts more successfully than other common predictors (e.g., genetic relatedness, social closeness, interdependence). Many others have shown how such norms, or a subset of such norms, influence phenomena such as interpersonal attraction (Clark & Mills, 1979), as well as behaviors such as helping, seeking help, keeping track of another's welfare or contributions to tasks, sexual behaviors, and expressions of emotions and reactions to expressions of emotion (see Clark & Mills, 2012, for an overview)."}, {"title": "Cultural, demographic, and temporal variations in relational norms", "content": "Different societies have distinct expectations about the roles, behaviors, and moral obligations within various relationship types, including those involving non-human entities (Coeckelbergh, 2022). This is likely to apply to human-Al relationships. How can the Relational Norms model, in conjunction with longstanding literatures in relationship science, social anthropology, and other fields, help us to understand and predict such likely cross-cultural variation in normative expectations for behavior within human-Al relationships?\nOn the one hand, the cooperative functions included in the Relational Norms model are hypothesized to be universal (albeit, in a so-called \"thin\" sense), given that all human societies face recurring coordination problems\u2014roughly of the sort described in Table 1\u2014that need to be resolved via socially recognized norms for cooperative interaction that may also vary across different relationships. On the other hand, the specific expressions of these functions, or \u201cthick\u201d norms (see Ryle, 1968a; 1968b; Geertz, 1973 on \u201cthin\u201d and \u201cthick\u201d descriptions), can be highly variable. Dimensions of such variance include the specific fulfillment conditions for each cooperative function (and therefore what counts as norm-compliant behavior); the specific relationships that are normatively expected to serve, or not to serve, each cooperative function in a given society; and the relative strength with which such norms are applied to, or enforced within, various relationships both within and across cultures (Mills et al., 2004; Gelfand et al., 2011; Miller, Akiyama, & Kapadia, 2017).\nFor example, what counts as respectful behavior in the context of a hierarchical relationship with one's superior will often differ from society to society (and may also change over time); however, the basic expectation that those with legitimate authority over others, who do not abuse this authority, ought to be treated in a respectful manner is true across cultures (Fiske, 1992). Similarly, what counts as flirtatious behavior, or the rules around flirting (McDonald, 2022), may vary from culture to culture; but the basic understanding that flirting is more appropriate in the context of relationships that are considered eligible to serve the mating function in a given society than in those considered ineligible (i.e., relationships within which mating is strongly proscribed), is presumably universal.\nAlternatively, consider the care function. In some societies (e.g., a rural Chinese farming community; Fei et al., 1992), the \u201cneighbor\u201d relationship may be expected to be relatively communal in orientation, with neighbors looking after each other's needs and interests without keeping track of \u201cwho owes what to whom\u201d in many cases, whereas, in other societies or communities (e.g., fellow apartment-dwellers in a large urban metropolis), the same relationship may have much weaker care norms and may even be somewhat transactional in nature. Likewise, hierarchical norms may be stronger for some relationships in some cultures, affecting expectations around authority and deference; and so on. Such cross-cultural variation will then influence how specific relational roles are perceived and enacted within each context (Earp et al. 2021; Marshall et al. 2022), and thus how behavior within each relational role is judged or responded to (e.g., failing to remember one's neighbor's birthday; \u201ctalking back\u201d to one's parents or grandparents).\nVariations in relational norms can also occur across different demographic groups even within a society. Age, in particular, may often predict quite different expectations or attitudes about acceptable versus unacceptable behavior in the context of different relationships (e.g., staring at one's phone while eating dinner with one's parents) (however, see Mastroianni & Gilbert, 2023, for qualifications regarding \u201cthe illusion of moral decline\u201d between generations). This may also be true for human-Al relationships. For example, younger generations, having grown up with digital technology, might be more comfortable with Al systems fulfilling a wider range of relational roles. Consistent with this possibility is evidence that children, more so than adults, consider robots as true social partners (Kahn et al., 2012; Kahn, Gary, & Shen, 2012; Sommer et al., 2019; Reinecke, Wilks, & Bloom, 2025), a tendency that may extend to emerging Al systems (Flanagan, Wong, & Kushnir, 2023). Factors such as gender and race also intersect with relational roles both within and between cultures in ways that may shape human-Al interactions also (Hester & Gray, 2020; Nadeem, Marjanovic & Abedin, 2022).\nFinally, relational norms do not necessarily remain static over time (Danaher, 2021). For example, in human-human relationships, the degree of hierarchy considered appropriate within a typical doctor-patient relationship has evolved, in recent decades, from a highly paternalistic model (\u201cdoctor knows best\u201d) to a what is sometimes called a \u201cshared decision-making\" model based on weaker hierarchy norms (Brock, 1991; Taylor, 2009; see also Reinecke, Kappes, et al., 2025). Other norms, by contrast, have proven to be more diachronically stable (e.g., the proscription on mating in parent-child relationships). A similar lesson to applies human-Al relationships. At least some relational norms for human-Al cooperation will likely evolve as Al technologies advance and social attitudes shift (Hopster & Maas, 2023). What seems novel or concerning today\u2014such as Al companions or romantic partners\u2014may become conventional. As Al systems exhibit increasingly sophisticated behaviors and capabilities, the norms governing various cooperative functions may need to adapt accordingly."}, {"title": "Section 2: Distinctive Characteristics of Al and Implications for Relational Norms", "content": "Understanding relational norms provides valuable insights into how humans navigate social interactions and make moral judgments based on the prescriptive (or proscriptive) sets of cooperative functions and associated goods of different relationship types.

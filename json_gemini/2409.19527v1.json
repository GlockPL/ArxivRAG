Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful tools for urban annotation, enabling deeper insights into urban environments. However, challenges remain in creating accurate and detailed urban building exterior databases, identifying critical indicators for energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and human-centric design, and systematically organizing these indicators. To address these challenges, we propose BuildingView, a novel approach that integrates high-resolution visual data from Google Street View with spatial information from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API. This research improves the accuracy of urban building exterior data, identifies key sustainability and design indicators, and develops a framework for their extraction and categorization. Our methodology includes a systematic literature review, building and Street View sampling, and annotation using the ChatGPT-40 API. The resulting database, validated with data from New York City, Amsterdam, and Singapore, provides a comprehensive tool for urban studies, supporting informed decision-making in urban planning, architectural design, and environmental policy.

Within this context, the study of building exteriors has gained sig- nificant attention due to its direct impact on critical areas such as energy efficiency[1], environmental sustainability[2], and human- centric urban design[3]. Building exteriors serve not only as the physical interface between a structure and its environment but also play a crucial role in determining the overall energy perfor- mance and aesthetic appeal of urban spaces. Street view imagery, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offer- ing a unique and detailed perspective on building exteriors that traditional remote sensing methods often overlook[4]. Unlike re- mote sensing imagery, which provides a top-down view of urban landscapes, street view imagery captures buildings at eye level, revealing intricate details of their spatial attributes, materials, and architectural styles[5]. This granular level of detail is vital for assess- ing the impact of building exteriors on factors such as urban heat islands, energy consumption, and the overall aesthetic coherence of neighborhoods. While street view imagery offers these advantages, its potential remains underutilized in urban research, particularly when it comes to integrating this visual data with other spatial datasets to provide a comprehensive understanding of building exteriors and their broader urban implications. This highlights the growing need to harness street view imagery more effectively to address the multifaceted challenges of modern urban environments. Through a systematic search of the urban building exteriors research, it is evident that there is a significant gap in the availabil- ity of comprehensive databases that integrate street view imagery with detailed building exterior information. Existing studies tend to focus on either the spatial characteristics of buildings-such"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Indicators of Building Exteriors Indicators", "content": "In the realm of urban informatics and geoscience, the development of spatiotemporal databases pertaining to buildings has garnered significant attention. Researchers within the disciplines of urban planning and geography typically concentrate on the spatial char- acteristics of buildings, such as their geographic positioning and the dynamics of their interaction with adjacent infrastructure. For instance, the architectural and urban planning processes must metic- ulously consider the spatial interplay between buildings and their adjacent parking facilities to optimize energy efficiency [1].In con- trast, architects and designers are more inclined to examine the intrinsic elements of buildings, including materials and aesthetic design. Recently, the architectural style and the materials used for the exterior of buildings are continually subject to innovation and enhancement [6, 7].\nThe academic discourse has increasingly pivoted towards the examination of the connections between buildings and other indi- cators, with a particular emphasis on their impact on energy con- sumption and environmental sustainability. Especially, researchers are actively exploring ways to harness more energy from natu- ral sources through building design, thereby reducing the energy costs associated with buildings. Additionally, they are working to mitigate the thermal impacts caused by the urban heat island effect, which is exacerbated by the heat generated within urban environments [9]. Concurrently, there is a burgeoning interest in the human-centric aspects of building design, particularly how it fosters engagement and interaction with the public from a partici- patory perspective [3].\nWhile numerous open-source databases exist that cater to spe- cific domains of building information, they are often limited to a single aspect of building data. The foundational building attribute knowledge within these databases is typically derived from field sur- veys or footprint data extracted from remote sensing imagery [10]. To date, no open-source database has been developed that integrates street view imagery to provide a comprehensive, visually-driven repository encompassing the spatial. Thus, we want to build a spa- tial database with fundamental, and external surface properties of buildings, with a focus on their relevance to energy, environmental, and human-centric dimensions."}, {"title": "2.2 SVI and LLMs in Urban Building Analysis", "content": "The advent of street view imagery (SVI) has revolutionized the way urban environments are analyzed, offering a rich and dynamic geospatial data source that rivals traditional remote sensing meth- ods such as satellite imagery [5]. The comprehensive visual data captured by SVI allows for detailed analysis and understanding of urban environments at the street level, providing critical insights into various urban characteristics and phenomena.\nPrevious research has demonstrated the utility of SVI in urban studies by integrating it with other urban data sources such as street networks, building information, demographic and socioeconomic data, and survey responses. For instance, SVI has been utilized to audit neighborhood environments [8], and analyze the effects of green view indices on pedestrian activity[11]. Additionally, studies have explored the use of SVI and machine learning to measure the built environment's impact on crime [12], as well as investigating the relationship between neighborhood walkability factors and walking behaviors using big data approaches [13]. Furthermore, SVI has been applied at a global scale, as seen in the creation of extensive datasets that cover millions of street-level images across hundreds of cities, facilitating large-scale urban science and analytics[14].\nHowever, to date, there has been no significant work that fo- cuses on using SVI in conjunction with LLMs to construct a com- prehensive database of urban building exteriors. The proposed BuildingView project aims to fill this gap by harnessing the com- bined power of SVI and multimodal LLMs to create an extensive and detailed urban building exteriors database, which can serve as a valuable resource for a wide range of urban studies, including architectural analysis, urban planning, and environmental assess- ment."}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "In this study, we introduce BuildingView, a novel framework for con- structing urban building exteriors databases using Street View im- agery and multimodal large language models. The research frame- work is divided into three primary steps: (1) a systematic literature review of building exterior indicators; (2) sampling of buildings and street view imagery using the Overpass and Google Street View APIs to gather data points; and (3) anno- tation of street view images using the ChatGPT-40 API to create the Urban Building Exteriors Database. Further details on each of these steps are provided below."}, {"title": "3.1 Systematic Literature Review of Exteriors Indicators", "content": "Global building morphology indicators database has concluded many indicators for urban data science [15]. However, a database of buildings directly covering energy, green, and human-centred buildings has not yet been created. Our goal is to establish a building database that encompasses the majority of indicators of interest to researchers. This database will include comprehensive spatial information on buildings and knowledge extracted from street view images through advanced vision analytics and vision-based reasoning techniques.\nFor that, we have done a systematic literature review on building exteriors Figure 2. The initial step is to identify emerging topics concerning building exteriors over the past five years. To achieve this, we conduct a keyword search on \"building envelope,\" \"exterior of building,\" and \"building exterior\" within the Web of Science database. Our search yields 6, 285 relevant scholarly works. There is a growing discussion about the intelligent design of external surfaces of buildings. The integration of innovative materials and intelligent technologies has the potential to significantly enhance the comfort of indoor environments [16]."}, {"title": "3.2 Sampling of Buildings and Street View Imagery", "content": "We begin by using the Nominatim API to fetch city names and their corresponding countries based on a query provided through the command line. Nominatim, an open-source geocoding service, outputs a list of cities and countries that match the query, allowing for accurate identification of the desired city and country[24]. This makes it easier to directly locate the corresponding bounding box by simply inputting the city and country names, streamlining the data collection process.\nFor the building sampling, we employ the Overpass API to re- trieve and save building data for the specified city and country. The Overpass API[25], which is used to query the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database, performs several tasks: it retrieves the bounding box coordinates for the given city and country, queries the OSM database to obtain building IDs and their coordinates within the bounding box, gathers additional details such as the address and height of each building, and saves the building data into a JSONL file, organized by building types.\nFinally, to match the buildings with their corresponding street view exteriors, we use the Google Street View API to download images for the locations specified in the JSONL file. This process involves creating a directory to store the images based on the name of the JSONL file, reading the latitude and longitude coordinates from the file, and downloading images using the Google Street View API for each specified location. The images are then saved in the created directory. To ensure accuracy, the building ID coordinates are centered within a 30-meter buffer, and the closest street view image is selected for each building, saved in a 600 \u00d7 300 format."}, {"title": "3.3 Annotation with Multimodal Large Language Model", "content": "We annotate the street view imagery using OpenAI's ChatGPT-40, a state-of-the-art language model designed to generate human-like text based on tailored prompts [26]. To ensure stability and efficiency in API requests, we implement a robust, multi-threaded framework capable of managing multiple API keys to optimize the distribution of API calls. The prompts for annotation are meticulously developed based on urban building exterior indicators identified during our preliminary research. To maintain flexibility and adaptability in the annotation process, we incorporate customizable configurations, allowing modifications to suit specific research objectives.\nWe further streamline the annotation process by automating key tasks, including image downloading, error handling, and data man- agement. This automation framework facilitates the execution of tasks according to predefined parameters, manages failed download attempts, consolidates data into a unified dataset while eliminating duplicate records, and tracks processed data to prevent redundancy.\nThe indicators resulting from our annotation process are de- signed to be exportable in various spatial data formats, including CSV, Shapefile, and GeoJSON. Our accompanying documentation provides several examples for querying and exporting data into both tabular and geospatial formats, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of analytical tools.\nTo promote accessibility and facilitate the distribution of ready- to-use datasets, we compile and publish datasets for multiple cities as open data within a dedicated repository. This repository includes datasets for cities and countries with detailed mapping available in OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it continues to expand as we add new locations. The ongoing development of this repository reflects our commitment to providing comprehensive and up-to-date urban building exterior data."}, {"title": "4 Experiment", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Data", "content": "We construct an Urban Building Exteriors Database using Street View Imagery, theoretically applicable to any urban area with street views. For this project, we select three representative cities: New York City (NYC), Amsterdam, and Singapore. The distribution of data points for the three cities is shown in Figure3.\nEach city is chosen based on its unique architectural charac- teristics and urban landscape. New York City is renowned for its iconic skyscrapers and diverse architectural styles, ranging from historic brownstones to modern glass towers [27].

For most metrics, the effective generation rate exceeds 99.90%. How- ever, the effective generation rate for streetscape perception scores is comparatively lower at 86.05%, primarily due to the inherent randomness in ChatGPT's generation process and the complexities involved in regular expression matching.\nTo evaluate the model's predictive performance, we select four key variables: Floor-to-Floor Height Numeric Only, Window-to- Wall Ratio (WWR), Vertices, and Tree Coverage. Using manual in- spection as the benchmark, we randomly sample 200 instances from the three cities and calculate three key statistical indicators: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and $R^2$.\nThe results show that while predictive accuracy varies among dif- ferent variables, the overall performance remains strong, as shown in Table 2. Notably, the $R^2$ values for Floor-to-Floor Height Numeric Only and WWR are 0.83036 and 0.74679, respectively. Although the Vertices variable presents certain challenges, its $R^2$ value of 0.69767 still indicates a reasonable level of predictive capability."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The building's exterior has garnered considerable attention among researchers in the GIS domain and those engaged in urban and architectural studies. Concurrently, an increasing array of inter- disciplinary professionals is examining the multifaceted influence that buildings exert on human life, the natural environment, and energy consumption. Conventional spatial databases often rely on survey data, with building attribute information typically confined to specific domains. Our conviction is that the academic community requires a comprehensive, global spatial database that documents the appearance of buildings, encompassing a wide array of signifi- cant locations.\nBased on our literature review of building exteriors, we have cat- egorized building exterior indicators across human-centric, energy, environmental, and basic information of buildings and initiated a spatial database that covers these indicators using the Large Lan- guage Model and computer vision. The characterization of building exteriors in our spatial database is grounded in the interpretations provided by ChatGPT-40. While ChatGPT-40's proficiency in im- age comprehension is widely recognized, the absence of innate knowledge necessitates a methodical approach. To this end, we randomly select 200 street-level images from our database and un- dertake a meticulous manual review to ensure the precise depiction of building exteriors. Given that the human-centric assessments of building exteriors are inherently subjective, we have forgone verifying human-centric indicators.\nWe have identified and scrutinized four key indicators to evalu- ate the fidelity of our data: floor-to-floor height, window-to-wall ratio (WWR), the architectural vertices of the buildings, and the number of surrounding trees. Our manual review Table 2 reveals that the vision-based experiment has yielded robust results. De- spite the challenges posed by occlusions inherent in street views, ChatGPT-40 has shown remarkable accuracy in correlating build- ing heights, extrapolating door and window features, and assessing the immediate built environment. However, the number of build- ing vertices-a three-dimensional characteristic-proved to be less accurate when relying solely on a single street view perspective. This limitation is attributed to the depth of field constraints, which can obscure the full dimensionality of the structures in question.\nDespite the availability of numerous methods to construct a comprehensive global architectural spatial database, the vision- based approach significantly reduces the expenditure of human and material resources. Our experiments, while promising, reveal areas for enhancement:\n(1) The absence of street views in certain locales indicates that the creation of a complete global database of building ap- pearances should integrate additional data sources, such as satellite imagery and expert survey data. Future endeavours could focus on developing a multi-source spatial database for building exteriors.\n(2) The single-view street view imagery presents challenges with occlusion and the limitations of a single perspective, af- fecting the accuracy of chatGPT-40's estimation of 3D build- ing exterior attributes. Future improvements can involve leveraging images from various perspectives to generate more precise exterior descriptions.\n(3) Our current classification of building exteriors is subjective based on research trends. Moving forward, we aim to employ a more systematic text processing methodology, including optimizing chatGPT prompts, utilizing advanced NLP for text categorization, and incorporating additional databases to refine the accuracy of building exterior descriptions."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we have compiled a list of hot topics related to build- ing exteriors for the last five years. Twenty-six metrics were sum- marised and categorised into disciplines. Our study presents a novel spatial database for building exteriors, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating AI and street view imagery to enhance the complete- ness of the database. The validation of our approach highlights its potential for efficiency and accuracy, setting a precedent for similar endeavours. Such a workflow can be replicated for global regions, resulting in a worldwide database of building exteriors.\nUpon enhancing the building classification approach through the integration of multi-source datasets, we anticipate the development of a comprehensive and accurate global building exteriors database. This envisioned database will serve as a solid foundation, providing invaluable insights and data to researchers and industry experts alike."}]}

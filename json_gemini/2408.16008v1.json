INTRODUCTION", "content": "Traditional methods in digital pathology, including optical\nmicroscopy-based analysis and standard image processing\ntechniques, struggle to handle cell diversity and heterogeneity.\nImage analysis plays an essential role and is utilized for\nmeasuring various metrics (e.g., nuclear division count, Ki-67\nlabeling index, HER2 score, etc.). For these measurements,\nthe open-source image processing and analysis programs\nNIH Image/ImageJ and QuPath are\nwidely used. While they are capable of quantifying the tissue structure\nand characteristics, they often require manual handling due\nto limitations of automatic processing. Therefore, accurate\nquantification of the cell diversity and heterogeneity remains\na challenge.\nVarious methods have been introduced into the field of cell-\ncell interaction analysis. Recent advances in analyses using\noptical microscopy have allowed for a better understanding of\nhow cells interact within the complex architecture of tissues\n. Advances in cell staining have enabled\nmultiplex imaging and brought new techniques to the analysis\nof cell interactions, such as Image Mass Cytometry and CODEX. However, tra-\nditional binarization and segmentation methods used in these\ntechniques still struggle to effectively address the dynamics of\ncell interactions. Recently, spatial omics analysis has emerged,\nproviding classification and segmentation of cells based on\nRNA-seq data, to further analyze the cell distribution and\ninteractions. While this method is used for analyzing cell\ninteractions, it falls under an object-based approach in image\nanalysis. Despite advancements, there remains a significant\nchallenge in accurately quantifying cellular interactions.\nTo analyze cell interactions, it\nis necessary to address their colo-\ncalization. Methods for studying\ncellular co-localization, which ex-\namine the spatial proximity of\ndifferent cells, can be catego-\nrized into two approaches: pixel-\nbased and object-based. Pixel-\nbased methods are highly quanti-\ntative, as they directly link signal\nintensity to cell quantity. Con-\nversely, object-based methods re-\nquire the initial segmentation of\nthe image into distinct objects\n. However,\nthis segmentation process can\ndisrupt the direct relationship between signal intensity and\ncell quantity.\nIn recent years, image analysis has been conducted using\nartificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including deep learn-"}, {"title": "2. THE METHOD", "content": "ing. Since the basic concept of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) was first proposed as LeNet numerous improvements and advancements have been made,\nsuch as AlexNet and ResNet.\nThe progress of deep learning methods has led to sub-\nstantial enhancements in image analysis . \nA distinct advantage of this approach is its ability to pro-\nvide \"classification probabilities\" alongside \"labels,\" where\n\"labels\" refer to the names or identifiers assigned to specific\nobjects or regions in image analysis, and \"classification prob-\nabilities\" represent the likelihood of an object belonging to\na particular class or category. Although deep learning-based\nmethods are categorized as object-based methods, they enable a more nuanced and probabilistic\nunderstanding of object detection. These advantages open up\nnew possibilities for analysis that were not achievable with\ntraditional object-based methods, which typically involve set-\nting a cutoff value to determine whether an object is present or\nnot, resulting in a binary classification. Nevertheless, detailed\nreports on methods for co-localization analysis using these\nnew techniques remain limited.\nBased on these findings, we hypothesized that deep\nlearning-based classification probabilities represent cell pres-\nence and facilitate a nuanced understanding of cellular in-\nteractions within complex tissue structures. Before validating\nthis hypothesis, we introduced the novel Spatial Interaction\nPotential (SIP) and the Cellular Interaction Force (CIF).\nSIP leverages these classification probabilities to evaluate the\npotential for cell-to-cell interactions as if in an electric field-\nlike manner, utilizing these distances in CIF to evaluate the\nstrength of interactions that takes into account the dynamics\nof random cell movements. Furthermore, by defining the Co-\nLocalization Index (CLI) as the sum of CIFs for all cell\npair combinations, we enabled the evaluation of spatial in-\nteractions between cells. This approach not only exceeds the\ncapabilities of traditional object-based approaches but is also\ntailored to provide a more sophisticated analysis of the pivotal\nphysical contacts involved in cellular interactions.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2\ndescribes the mathematical basis for defining SIP and deriv-\ning CLI, and explains the practical considerations made for\ntheir implementation.

Although it\nis proprietary, this platform is based on the universal ResNet\narchitecture . In the final layer of our model,\nsimilar to a conventional network configuration, the platform\napplies the softmax function to determine cell types (labels)\nand their associated probabilities. This method allows the\nmodel to classify each cell precisely and provide a probability\nscore for each classification.\nThe probability output from the final layer's softmax func-\ntion is represented by\n$softmax(x) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\Sigma e^x}$\nwhere x is the input vector, and $softmax(x)_i$ is a specific el-\nement of the output vector. The softmax function transforms\neach element of the input vector into a non-negative value\nusing the exponential function, and subsequently divides each\nelement by the sum of these values to represent them as\nprobabilities. Due to the properties of the softmax function,\neach element of the output falls within the range of 0 to 1,\nwith their total sum equaling 1. Therefore, $softmax(x)_i$ can\nbe interpreted as indicating the probability that x belongs to\nthe ith class (or category).\nTreating the classification probabilities as probabilities of\ncell presence, the output probabilities can be represented\nas conditional probabilities learned under specific training\nsets.

DISCUSSION", "content": "In this study, we have developed an innovative and robust\napproach for analyzing and quantifying cellular interactions\non digital pathology images. By considering the probability\nof cell presence through the utilization of deep learning and\nthe distances between cells, CLI can assess the accumulation\nof intercellular interaction based on spatial arrangements.\nMoreover, the evaluation method for CLI is represented by a\nsimple and intuitively understandable formula. Furthermore,\nCLI can be generalized to combinations of more than three\ncell types.\nOur method utilizes deep learning to identify cells and\ndetermine their probabilities, allowing us to infer the likeli-\nhood of a cell's presence in a given location. This approach\noffers a potential solution to restore the quantitativeness of\ncells that may be overlooked by object-based cell detection\nmethods. By assuming the probability of a cell's presence, we\ncan probabilistically calculate whether cells in close proximity\nwill come into contact and interact as a result of follwing\ncell movement. Using this method, we first simulated the\nfrequency of cell-cell contact within a certain distance over a\ngiven period. The results showed that, both in two and three\ndimensions, the cumulative number of contacts is inversely\nproportional to the square of the initial distance between the\ncells r. This suggests that once the probability of cell presence\np and the intercellular distance r are known, it is possible\nto quantify the contact between cells that leads to CIF $\\Psi$.\nThis finding aligns with the commonly observed behavior in\nvarious physical interactions and diffusion processes where the\ncontact count diminishes proportionally to the square of the\ndistance. Based on the simulation results, we defined the CIF\n$\\Psi$ as follows:\n$\\Psi = K_e \\frac{p_1 p_2}{r^2}$\nIn dense cellular environments, it is expected that cells within\nthe same locality will engage in complex interactions.

To address concerns related to\nthese probabilities q, an appropriate approach involves com-\nbining data collection and sampling methodologies, statistical\ntechniques, annotation plans, machine learning, and domain\nexpertise to create a cell dataset that appropriately reflects\nthe parent population. However, as these approaches extend\nbeyond the scope of this paper, they are deferred to another\nopportunity.\nThere are concerns regarding the validity of assuming that\ncell interactions are inversely proportional to the square of\nthe distance. In general, it is common for interactions between\ncells to be influenced by the square of the distance. This is\nattributed to the observations of effects proportional to the\nsquare of the distance in many physical phenomena such as\nCoulomb forces, gravity, and diffusion. Such distance-squared-\ninfluenced interactions are applicable to numerous physical\nlaws and phenomena, and they are believed to be applicable\nin modeling cell-cell interactions.\nFor the current study, the use of the uniform distribution\nin the random walk model for cell movement raises valid\nconcerns about whether it provides a sufficiently accurate\nsimulation. The persistent random walk model assumes that\nparticles exhibit random movement while maintaining a per-\nsistent trend in a specific direction and has been widely\nutilized in the analysis of cell movement patterns . Subsequent\nresearch has further modified and extended these models.\nFor instance, Mar\u00e9e et al. constructed a model con-\nsidering diffusion of specific substances in the cytoplasm\nand membrane to account for nonlinear relationships in the\nmovement of epidermal cells. Additionally, Schl\u00fcter et al.\nmodeled the influence of the extracellular matrix on\ncell movement. Various other models of cell interactions have\nalso been developed. Likely, the extent\nto which cell-cell contact frequencies and interactions are\ninfluenced by distance depends on the specific configuration\nof the model. One of the limitations of simulation studies\nis their dependence on the specific setup of the model. It\nwould require further research, including prognostic analyses,\nto determine the biological validity of the CLI developed in\nthis study.\nFor the practical implementation of CLI, it is important to\ndetermine the constant $K_e$. We considered an ideal scenario\nwhere cells with a probability of 1 are densely packed in order\nto determine the constants. There could be other variations\nto consider regarding the size and arrangement of cells, and\nthe choice of 100 cells is somewhat arbitrary. However, this\nchoice was made considering situations where relatively small\ncells, such as lymphocytes, tend to cluster, and it is believed\nto have some biological plausibility. Moreover, it is considered\nthat this metric could be standardized to some extent for not\nonly a single cell type but also among multiple cell types.\nIn this study, we have proposed the CLI as a novel quanti-\ntative method for intercellular interactions. The spatial inter-\nactions utilized in this work are purely geometric, and further\ninvestigation is required to ascertain the biological utility of\nthe CLI as presented in this study.\nThe following are descriptions of the advantages of the\nproposed CLI": "n\u2022 A novel approach to handling cell presence probabilities:\nUnder the constraints of fixed pathology specimens", "arrangement": "By taking into ac-\ncount the distances between cells, CLI can assess the ac-\ncumulation of intercellular"}]}

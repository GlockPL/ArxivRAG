INTRODUCTION", "content": "Traditional methods in digital pathology, including optical microscopy-based analysis and standard image processing techniques, struggle to handle cell diversity and heterogeneity. Image analysis plays an essential role and is utilized for measuring various metrics (e.g., nuclear division count, Ki-67 labeling index, HER2 score, etc.). For these measurements, the open-source image processing and analysis programs NIH Image/ImageJ and QuPath are widely used. While they are capable of quantifying the tissue structure and characteristics, they often require manual handling due to limitations of automatic processing. Therefore, accurate quantification of the cell diversity and heterogeneity remains a challenge.\nVarious methods have been introduced into the field of cell-cell interaction analysis. Recent advances in analyses using optical microscopy have allowed for a better understanding of how cells interact within the complex architecture of tissues. Advances in cell staining have enabled multiplex imaging and brought new techniques to the analysis of cell interactions, such as Image Mass Cytometry and CODEX. However, traditional binarization and segmentation methods used in these techniques still struggle to effectively address the dynamics of cell interactions. Recently, spatial omics analysis has emerged, providing classification and segmentation of cells based on RNA-seq data, to further analyze the cell distribution and interactions. While this method is used for analyzing cell interactions, it falls under an object-based approach in image analysis. Despite advancements, there remains a significant challenge in accurately quantifying cellular interactions.\nTo analyze cell interactions, it is necessary to address their co-localization. Methods for studying cellular co-localization, which examine the spatial proximity of different cells, can be categorized into two approaches: pixel-based and object-based. Pixel-based methods are highly quantitative, as they directly link signal intensity to cell quantity. Conversely, object-based methods require the initial segmentation of the image into distinct objects. However, this segmentation process can disrupt the direct relationship between signal intensity and cell quantity.\nIn recent years, image analysis has been conducted using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including deep learning."}, {"title": "2. THE METHOD", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Mathematical foundations on probability of existence", "content": "This study employed the commercial Cu-Cyto\u00ae automated image analysis platform for its flexibility in integrating supplementary analysis algorithms. Although it is proprietary, this platform is based on the universal ResNet architecture. In the final layer of our model, similar to a conventional network configuration, the platform applies the softmax function to determine cell types (labels) and their associated probabilities. This method allows the model to classify each cell precisely and provide a probability score for each classification.\nThe probability output from the final layer's softmax function is represented by\nsoftmax(x) = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum e^{x_j}}\nwhere x is the input vector, and softmax(x)i is a specific element of the output vector. The softmax function transforms each element of the input vector into a non-negative value using the exponential function, and subsequently divides each element by the sum of these values to represent them as probabilities. Due to the properties of the softmax function, each element of the output falls within the range of 0 to 1, with their total sum equaling 1. Therefore, softmax(x)i can be interpreted as indicating the probability that x belongs to the ith class (or category).\nTreating the classification probabilities as probabilities of cell presence, the output probabilities can be represented as conditional probabilities learned under specific training sets. The learning algorithm aims to train a model to discover a function f : x \u2192 y that predicts target y from input data x. With a collection of training datasets D = {(X1,Y1), (X2,Y2),..., (XN, YN)}, a model M trained on D outputs a probability PM (y = ix, D) for an input x, indicating the probability that x belongs to class i. This probability is estimated by the model M based on the training dataset D. Therefore, the conditional probability PM(y = i|x, D) that x belongs to class i should closely approximate the existence probability pi if the size |D| of the training dataset is sufficiently large.\n\\lim_{|D|\\rightarrow\\infty} P_M (y = i|x, D) \\approx p_i\nThis approximation is valid when the training dataset D effectively reflects the true population P. That is, it hinges on whether the training dataset has been created with precise and comprehensive information by annotating all identifiable cell types during cell annotation. Let us denote the accuracy of this annotation as probability q.\n\\lim_{D\\rightarrow\\infty} P_M (y = i|x, D) = p_i \\quad \\Lambda \\quad D \\approx P\nIf the training dataset is sufficiently large and accurately reflects the population, it is reasonable to treat classification probabilities as existence probabilities. In other words, if the training dataset D asymptotically reflects the true population P under the probability q, it is reasonable to treat classification probabilities as existence probabilities."}, {"title": "2.2 Introduction of spatial interaction potential", "content": "In pathological specimens, cells are immobilized due to processes such as formalin fixation, although it is presumed that they were capable of movement prior to fixation. This limitation in temporal information can hinder the accurate assessment of contact events. To address this, consider a cell at the origin (0,0) with a probability of presence denoted as p, and an interaction constant Ke. The Spatial Interaction Potential (SIP) at a coordinate (x,y) can be defined as follows:\n\\Phi = K_e \\frac{p}{x^2 + y^2}"}, {"title": "Co-Localization Index for Cellular Interactions", "content": "This formulation allows for the definition of a field of cellular interactions, analogous to magnetic or electric fields, facilitating the consideration of potential contact scenarios. The spatial interaction potential decays proportionally to the square of the distance r\u00b2 from the cell's position. This potential is thought to represent the distribution of the likelihood of neighboring cells having either previously come into contact with the cell or potentially making contact with it in the future, under the assumption that the cell remains stationary.\nLet us consider the case where two cells are present. Around the cell denoted as A, the previously defined cellular interaction potential is distributed around it. Similarly, around the cell denoted as B, a similar potential is distributed. These cells, A and B, have the potential to have come into contact in the past or may potentially come into contact in the future. In such a scenario, it is conceivable that the possibility of cells A and B coming into contact at any given coordinate can be compounded.\nThe composite potential of the two types of spatial interaction potentials, denoted as Pc, is defined as follows. The first potential is denoted as 1, and its value at the position coordinates (x, y) is denoted as \u03a61 (x, y). Similarly, the second potential is denoted as 2, and its value at the position coordinates (x, y) is denoted as \u03a62(x, y). The composite potential \u03a6c is the sum of \u03a61 (x, y) and \u03a62(x, y). The composite spatial interaction potential \u03a6c can be visualized at each position coordinate (x,y), and this is referred to as a spatial interaction map. Using this spatial interaction map, we conducted the visualization of cell-cell interactions and the evaluation of CLI.\n\\Phi_c(x, y) = \\Phi_1 (x, y) + \\Phi_2(x, y)\nIn practice, a grid with intervals of 3.843\u03bcm is set up, and the synthetic spatial interaction potential \u03a6c is calculated at each intersection coordinate.

The relationship is given by the equation:\n\\Psi = K_e \\frac{p_1p_2}{r^2}\nThis expression demonstrates that \u03a8 is directly proportional to the product of the presence probabilities p\u2081 and p2, and inversely proportional to the square of the cell-cell distance r.

It has been established that arranging the circles alternately allows for more efficient packing of coins compared to a regular grid pattern.

Briefly, tissue sections of 4-\u03bcm thickness underwent the following staining process. These sections were initially deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through a series of ethanol dilutions. Antigen retrieval was performed by heat-induced epitope retrieval. Subsequently, sections were subject to immunostaining using the following primary monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): an anti-CD8 mouse mAb (clone C8/144B, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), an anti-CD103 rabbit mAb (clone EPR4166(2), abcam). Dual staining for CD8 and CD103 utilized Histofine Simple Stain AP (M) (mouse, Nichirei) and Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (R) (rabbit, Nichirei) as secondary antibody complexes. Chromogenic development was achieved using First Red II substrate kit (Nichirei) and HistoGreen substrate kit (Eurobio-Abcys, Les Ulis, France).

APPLICATION TO REAL BIOLOGICAL IMAGING", "content": "Patch images were extracted using whole slide images (WSI) of colorectal cancer. Among images showing the co-presence of cancer and lymphocytes, 286 were randomly selected. Each image then underwent cell detection using AI. Furthermore, we calculated the sum of the composite spatial interaction potential (\u03a3\u03a6c) at every point of a grid-based coordinate system, and investigated the correlation between CLI and \u03a3\u03a6, hereinafter simply referred to as SIP for simplicity.\nFigure 18 illustrates the relationship between the number of cell contacts, SIP, and CLI in biological images. While a moderate positive correlation between SIP and contact numbers is suggested , a stronger positive correlation was indicated between CLI and contact numbers.\nThe relationship between the number of cancer cells and SIP is shown in Figure 19a. Areas with a higher number of cancer cells tended to have higher SIP between cancer cells and lymphocytes. The relationship between the number of cancer cells and CLI is presented in Figure 19b. Similarly, areas with a higher number of cancer cells showed a tendency for higher CLI between cancer cells and lymphocytes. A similar trend was observed for the relationship between the number of lymphocytes and SIP (Figure 20a), as well as the relationship between lymphocytes and CLI (Figure 20b). Subsequently, when the relationship between SIP and CLI was examined, the two were found to correlate well.\nThe spatial interaction potential was visualized using immunohistochemical staining images of colorectal cancer specimens. CD8 was labeled with Fast Red. In the original image , cells identified by AI including adenocarcinoma cells (orange), CD8+ lymphocytes (red), other lymphocytes (blue), macrophages, and stromal cells (green) are indicated by pins (Figure 22b).

DISCUSSION", "content": "In this study, we have developed an innovative and robust approach for analyzing and quantifying cellular interactions on digital pathology images. By considering the probability of cell presence through the utilization of deep learning and the distances between cells, CLI can assess the accumulation of intercellular interaction based on spatial arrangements. Moreover, the evaluation method for CLI is represented by a simple and intuitively understandable formula. Furthermore, CLI can be generalized to combinations of more than three cell types.\nOur method utilizes deep learning to identify cells and determine their probabilities, allowing us to infer the likelihood of a cell's presence in a given location. This approach offers a potential solution to restore the quantitativeness of cells that may be overlooked by object-based cell detection methods. By assuming the probability of a cell's presence, we can probabilistically calculate whether cells in close proximity will come into contact and interact as a result of follwing cell movement. Using this method, we first simulated the frequency of cell-cell contact within a certain distance over a given period. The results showed that, both in two and three dimensions, the cumulative number of contacts is inversely proportional to the square of the initial distance between the cells r. This suggests that once the probability of cell presence p and the intercellular distance r are known, it is possible to quantify the contact between cells that leads to CIF \u03a8. This finding aligns with the commonly observed behavior in various physical interactions and diffusion processes where the contact count diminishes proportionally to the square of the distance. Based on the simulation results, we defined the CIF \u03a8as follows:\n\\Psi = K_e \\frac{p_1p_2}{r^2}\nIn dense cellular environments, it is expected that cells within the same locality will engage in complex interactions. Therefore, we further summed the CIF of individual pairs and defined the CLI as follows:\n\\Omega = K_e \\sum_{i \\in A} \\sum_{j \\in B} \\frac{p_i p_j}{r^2}\n(c) and CLI. The composite SIP \u03a6c and CLI are dependent on common parameters such as the existence probability and the interaction constant Ke. Thus, a correlation between \u03a6c and CLI can be anticipated, although they are not identical. The CLI is based on the probabilities of the presence of Cell 1 and Cell 2 and their distance, which directly influences the correlation with the cellular distribution. For example, in areas where Cells 1 and 2 are densely present, the CLI is higher. On the contrary, in areas where Cells 1 and 2 are located further apart, the CLI is lower. The impact of cellular distribution on the correlation between the composite potential \u03a6c and CLI varies with the probabilities of Cell 1 and Cell 2's presence, the interaction constant Ke, and the characteristics of the cellular distribution. Generally, in areas with a denser cellular distribution, the values in CLI, compared to \u03a6c, are higher. However, when the cellular distribution is uniform, the values of CLI, in comparison to \u03a6c, do not drastically increase. Therefore, composite SIP and CLI differ slightly in their biological implications. In SIP, the potential for each cell is calculated without the distances between cells affecting the final sum, meaning SIP is an index that simply scales with the number of cells. In contrast, CLI is inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between cells, which means that for the same number of cells, the value increases when cells are closer together and clustered. Therefore, CLI not only reflects the number of cells but also their clustering. The reason why CLI showed a stronger correlation with contact numbers compared to SIP might be attributed to these factors. The computation of SIP requires calculating \u03a6c for each combination of cells at every point in a grid-based coordinate system, which involves a significant amount of computation. On the other hand, CLI only requires calculating cell interactions based on the number of detected cells, thus offering a considerable computational advantage.\nHowever, composite SIP is valuable for visualization. We refer to it as the spatial interaction map (SIM). SIM is a tool that allows for the visualization of the composite SIP \u03a6c for specific cell combinations. In Section 4, the application of SIM on actual biological images demonstrated its effectiveness. The interactions between cells were clearly depicted as a colormap, confirming its usefulness for visual understanding. Although the impressions received from the visualized SIP do not fully correlate with CLI, it is considered to have a certain level of usefulness for the image-based evaluation of CLI.\nCLI is a quantitative method for analyzing cell interactions that is derived by probabilistically considering spaciotemporal cell-cell contacts. The approach of deriving the probability of cell presence using deep neural networks offers significant benefits. By assigning the evaluation of cell presence probability to deep learning-based cell detection before calculating CLI, management becomes simpler. Ensuring that the learning dataset is sufficiently large and accurately reflects the population guarantees the precision of cell detection. In essence, quantifying cellular co-localization largely depends on the accuracy of deep learning, making the formula for calculating CLI exceedingly simple, clear, and robust. This allows developers to focus on creating algorithms for accurate cell detection and preparing datasets. Another advantage is its immediate applicability to commonly used specimens, such as standard HE staining and immunostaining. This is particularly critical in an era where expensive analytical methods, such as multiplex analysis and spatial omics analysis, are becoming more common. This approach is promising, given the technological advancements that enable cell detection in unstained or faded specimens.\nWe explain the reason for using CLI instead of directly utilizing the spatial interaction potential (SIP) derived for CLI. CLI reflects the distance factor more strongly than the sum of SIP. Furthermore, CLI requires simpler calculations and has a lower computational load. We demonstrated that a correlation exists between the sum of the composite SIPand the probability q need to be considered. Specifically, the following steps are necessary: first, an evaluation at the patch level to assess the accuracy of the assigned probabilities, second, an assessment at the count level to ensure the proper creation of pin positions and counts, and third, an evaluation of the annotation to ensure that the classification reflects the cell population of the parent population appropriately. Through these steps, the evaluation determines whether the probabilities in the \"classification space\" used by a specific AI can be regarded as the \"presence probability\" of cells on actual pathology slides. To address concerns related to these probabilities q, an appropriate approach involves combining data collection and sampling methodologies, statistical techniques, annotation plans, machine learning, and domain expertise to create a cell dataset that appropriately reflects the parent population. However, as these approaches extend beyond the scope of this paper, they are deferred to another opportunity.\nThere are concerns regarding the validity of assuming that cell interactions are inversely proportional to the square of the distance. In general, it is common for interactions between cells to be influenced by the square of the distance. This is attributed to the observations of effects proportional to the square of the distance in many physical phenomena such as Coulomb forces, gravity, and diffusion. Such distance-squared-influenced interactions are applicable to numerous physical laws and phenomena, and they are believed to be applicable in modeling cell-cell interactions.\nFor the current study, the use of the uniform distribution in the random walk model for cell movement raises valid concerns about whether it provides a sufficiently accurate simulation. The persistent random walk model assumes that particles exhibit random movement while maintaining a persistent trend in a specific direction and has been widely utilized in the analysis of cell movement patterns. Subsequent research has further modified and extended these models. For instance, Mar\u00e9e et al. constructed a model considering diffusion of specific substances in the cytoplasm and membrane to account for nonlinear relationships in the movement of epidermal cells. Additionally, Schl\u00fcter et al. modeled the influence of the extracellular matrix on cell movement. Various other models of cell interactions have also been developed . Likely, the extent to which cell-cell contact frequencies and interactions are influenced by distance depends on the specific configuration of the model. One of the limitations of simulation studies is their dependence on the specific setup of the model. It would require further research, including prognostic analyses, to determine the biological validity of the CLI developed in this study.\nFor the practical implementation of CLI, it is important to determine the constant Ke. We considered an ideal scenario where cells with a probability of 1 are densely packed in order to determine the constants. There could be other variations to consider regarding the size and arrangement of cells, and the choice of 100 cells is somewhat arbitrary. However, this choice was made considering situations where relatively small cells, such as lymphocytes, tend to cluster, and it is believed to have some biological plausibility. Moreover, it is considered that this metric could be standardized to some extent for not only a single cell type but also among multiple cell types.\nIn this study, we have proposed the CLI as a novel quantitative method for intercellular interactions. The spatial interactions utilized in this work are purely geometric, and further investigation is required to ascertain the biological utility of the CLI as presented in this study.\nThe following are descriptions of the advantages of the proposed CLI:\n\u2022\tA novel approach to handling cell presence probabilities: Under the constraints of fixed pathology specimens, CLI offers a new method that considers the probability of cell presence through the utilization of deep learning.\n\u2022\tConsideration of spatial arrangement: By taking into account the distances between cells, CLI can assess the accumulation of intercellular interaction potentials based on spatial arrangements.\n\u2022\tIntuitive evaluation method: The evaluation method of CLI is represented by a simple and intuitively understandable formula.\n\u2022\tGeneralization to the evaluation of co-localization among multiple cells: CLI can be applied to the evaluation of co-localization among combinations of more than three cell types, thus possessing features not present in conventional methods for analyzing intercellular co-localization. It enables the comparison of cell interactions by evaluating different combinations of cells.\nThe proposed CLI is an objective and reproducible new quantitative method for intercellular interactions. In actual pathological tissue images, CLI demonstrates high performance. Further investigation is expected to elucidate the biological significance of CLI."}]}

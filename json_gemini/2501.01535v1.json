The framework is rooted in contemporary developments of the three basic communicative capacities identified by American logician and pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce: iconic (sensory and perceptual qualities), indexical (contextual and sociocultural associations), and rule-like (symbolic and intuitive reasoning). Expanding on these developments, I introduce the concept of indexical contextualization and propose the principle of \u201ccontextualization directionality\u201d for characterizing the crucial metapragmatic capacity for maintaining, navigating, or transitioning between semantic and pragmatic modes of multimodal communication. I contend that current cognitive-social computational and engineering methodologies disproportionately emphasize the semantic/metasemantic domain, overlooking the pivotal role of metapragmatic indexicality in traversing the semantic-pragmatic spectrum of communication. The framework's broader implications for intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics in within-modal and cross-modal human-machine alignment are also discussed.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Multimodality is a significant area of research in psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy, and has recently gained critical importance in the rapidly evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, the challenge of systematically understanding and evaluating multimodality in human cognitive models and contemporary generative Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains a notoriously complex task. While Large Language Models (LLMs), as LMMs' most prominent single- modal counterpart, still grapple with basic evaluative issues such as functional capacity and interpretability (Mahowald et al., 2024), LMMs introduce exponentially larger parameter spaces and evaluative dimensions, the complexity of which arises from the need to account for not just linguistic or any single non-linguistic domain alone, but the intricate ways in which different perceptual, cognitive and communicative modalities, such as text, image, and sound, sophisticatedly interact, co-construct, and generate meaning.\nThese challenges underscore the necessity of new interpretive, evaluative, and alignment methodologies for generative LMMs and, more generally, for modeling and comprehending human-like multimodal communicative capacities overall. The need for novel multimodal frameworks for many purposes, particularly that of benchmarking and evaluating human-machine alignment and misalignment, is not simply a technical requirement but also a conceptual and theoretical one. On the other hand, the fact that multimodality itself has been a longstanding subject of inquiry especially in psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy, offers a rich intellectual and scientific tradition from which multimodal AI research can draw. Broadly, this paper positions that methodologies developed in these disciplines, particularly in relation to theories of perception, cognition, context, and meaning can be adapted to create more comprehensive interpretive and evaluative frameworks for modeling human-like multimodal communicative capacities. While the boundaries between artificial and human intelligence in single modalities have been extensively redrawn or redefined by the recent development in LLMs (Blank, 2023; Shiffrin & Mitchell, 2023; Binz & Schulz, 2023), the characterization of multimodal intelligence in the AI literature remains, arguably, predominantly influenced by engineering-centric or at times folk-style conceptualizations of text, voice, image, video, motion, among others. This underscores the particular need for a systematic conceptual and philosophical foundation relating human and artificial intelligence of multimodality and aligning the latter with human multimodal capacities themselves (Ji, 2024).\nIn line with several recent critiques, I consider that current methodologies and evaluative frameworks for human and machine language modeling tend to overemphasize semantic-like and content- based reasoning at large, whether deductive or inductive reasoning, such as domains like symbolic capacity, common-sense reasoning, or daily life physics, which I collectively refer to as the rule-like"}, {"title": "2. A Meta-level Multimodal Taxonomy", "content": "In recent scientific and AI literature, tensions between knowledge, communication, intramodal and intermodal capacities, and sociocultural sensitivity and impact have been widely acknowledged and debated (Raul et al., 2024). However, this tension has profound theoretical and historical roots in two classical dualisms that are shared across AI, philosophy, and cognitive science. The first contrasts semantic, structural, and symbolic knowledge with situational, contextual, and pragmatic knowledge (Putnam, 1975; Goldsmith & Laks, 2019), while the second contrasts the former types of knowledge with embodied, iconic, and perceptual ones (Barsalou, 1999, 2008; Lupyan & Winter, 2018; Greenberg, 2023). In the realm of AI, the challenge of incorporating situational, contextual, and pragmatic capacities, on the one hand, is widely discussed especially for intramodal text-based LLMs (Mahowald et al., 2024). On the other hand, embodied, iconic, and perceptual capacities are deemed essential for intermodal modeling, such as text-image and text-voice models, robotics, among others (Driess et al., 2023; Chia et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024). These two conceptions give rise to distinct empirical methodologies for linking perception-related and cognition-like capacities with the broader world, and contextual and pragmatic aspects are rarely explored along with embodied and perceptual capacities in theoretical and empirical research both approaches, however, grapple with similar challenges of bridging these capacities with semantic and rule-like modes of meaning.\nIn this section, I first propose a tripartite basis comprising iconic, indexical, and rule-like capacities. Building on this foundation, I develop a meta-level multimodal taxonomy aimed at bridging the above two seemingly incongruous dualisms in understanding and modeling meaning and communication."}, {"title": "2.1 Iconic, Indexical, and Rule-like Capacities for Meaning and Communication", "content": "I begin with the classical trichotomy of signs, icon, index, and symbol initially developed by Peirce (1992, 1998). Peirce's framework offers a systematic way to categorize the different ways in which meaning is constructed through domains from sensory-perceptual experiences to situational and sociocultural associations and logical or rule-like relationships. In this section, I break down how the Peircean categories of iconic, indexical, and rule-like can be adapted for understanding and modeling human-like multimodal capacities.\n- Iconic Capacities: Sensory and Perceptual Modes in Communication\nIn the Peircean terminology, icons are signs that bear a direct resemblance or likeness to the objects they represent. Within the context of multimodal models, iconicity captures the sensory and perceptual properties that are central to how these models process inputs and generate outputs that are directly related to sensation and perception (vision, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, sensorimotor, etc.). Specific iconic dimensions engage a cognitive system or a model's capacity to recognize or generate features that resemble or imitate the sensory-physical world, including images, sounds, textures, motion, among other sensory-perceptual phenomena.\nFrom the Peircean perspective, what makes iconicity particularly intriguing is its relationship to specific and concrete sensation and perceptually grounded modes in communication. Intramodal and intermodal iconic elements in communication can invoke feelings or subjective experiences that are not strictly logical or factual, but are grounded in the sensory or environmental quality of human sensory and perceptual experiences. For example, a LMM that generates an image or an auditory output in response to a text prompt is leveraging iconicity to evoke specific sensory experiences (or even aesthetic or emotive responses, which will be further discussed in Section 4.3). In essence, the iconic mode of communication taps into a cognitive system or a model's capacity to process and learn inputs and generate outputs that are perceptually specific and evocatively resonant if necessary.\n- Indexical Capacities: Situational and Sociocultural Sensitivity\nThe indexical category in Peirce's framework refers to signs that have a contextually associative connection to their referents. Particularly, indexical signs strongly relate to significant or specific socioculturally habituated associations that a human or model can recognize, replicate, or, in some cases, negotiate, manipulate, or deny. These associations are not based on perceptual or purely logical relationships per se, but are deeply embedded in situation and context, often predominantly associated with social practices and cultural meanings and dynamics.\nIndexicality highlights a cognitive system or a model's ability to relate to situationally and socioculturally contiguous connotations and to recognize the significance of such connotations (Silverstein, 1993), such as when a human or model is tasked with generating language or images appropriate for a specific sociocultural setting or particular group of human or agentive population. This extends to recognizing specific idioms, visual aesthetics linked to certain social groups, or stylistic preferences that signal identity, status, or affiliation, among others. Empirically, evaluating a cognitive system or a communicative model on its indexical capacity thus involves assessing its performance in recognizing the significance of specific sociocultural markers and adapting to sociocultural nuances and conventions. On the other hand, indexicality in this paper is conceived as much more than just a domain that imposes sociocultural connotations on iconic or rule-like processes (See Section 3).\n- Rule-like Capacities: Symbolic and Intuitive Reasoning at Large\nThe rule-like mode, which can be approximately mapped onto the Peircean notion of symbolic representation, encompasses signs interpreted as factual, truthful, rule-like, following any types of general principles or generalizing reasoning. I characterize rule-like capacities as involving assessing how well a cognitive or computational system adheres to factual accuracy, processes complex linguistic structures or mathematical relationships, applies classical induction and deduction, and navigates scenarios requiring an understanding of law-like regularities in the everyday world. In most contemporary work in analytic philosophy, cognitive science, and computer science, these domains are typically considered in a cross- domain manner. Recent developments have raised questions about, for example, why large generative models seem to handle semantic summarization more readily than arithmetic reasoning (Xu et al., 2024), or whether AI should grasp intuitive physics rather than merely extracting meaning from statistical co- occurrence patterns in text or pixels (LeCun, 2022). From the Peircean perspective, however, an important common characteristic shared across these cases is certain perceived or perceivable intrinsic regularity or internal coherence, whether within a sentence, an equation, a logical sequence, or an image. Regardless of whether these patterns emerge from logical procedures, symbolic representations, or statistical regularities, they exhibit a cognitive quality that is neither purely sensory-perceptual nor contextually associated, but appears in communication to be inherently rule-like, characterized by a certain level of within-domain or cross-domain consistency and coherence.\nIn the context of aligning human or human-like multimodal modeling, I use rule-like capacities to refer to the capacity to engage in symbolic and intuitive reasoning at large and in a broad sense. This involves a human or model's capacity to apply rule-like (but not necessarily rule-based) processes of meaning-making, driven by internal regularities, such as making predictions based on laws of physics or general rules, commonly accepted facts, or truths and intuitions about the world. For example, a LMM that can infer generic causal or correlative relationships, reason about physical interactions such as objects"}, {"title": "2.2. Meta-level Communicative Taxonomy Generated from the Three Basic Capacities", "content": "While the three basic capacities of communication are fundamental, they are not ontologically static, but epistemologically and communicatively generative across the entire spectrum of human communication. In realistic communication, humans often reflectively interpret images as carrying specific cultural implications, treat specific social conventions as generalizable or rule-like, or imbue objective facts with communal or personal connotations. Much existing work in AI tends to predominantly treat many of these domains as origins of misalignment, biases, or issues to be mitigated, but they reflect essential aspects of human behavioral and communicative spectrum. The rich meta-level interpretative capacities superimposing the three basic communicative modes must be systematically incorporated in the context of aligning generative multimodal models for both human and machine.\nSpecifically, there are three possible downshifting meta-level superimposing processes, where interpretive transitions occur from rule-like regularities to socioculturally conventional or perceptual regularities: from rule-like to iconic, from rule-like to indexical, and from indexical to iconic. Correspondingly, there are three upshifting meta-level superimposing processes, which move in the opposite direction: from iconic to indexical, from iconic to rule-like, and from indexical to rule-like.\nWhile Peirce offers a partial theoretical account of these meta-level, second-order multimodal relationships (Peirce, 1992, 1998), and contemporary sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology further develop numerous theoretical and empirical studies on the interplay among iconic, indexical, and rule-like"}, {"title": "3. Indexical Contextualization as the Central Metapragmatic Capacity to Navigate across Communicative Modes", "content": "How does human cognition effectively navigate the vast array of interpretive possibilities across the diverse non-meta and meta-level multimodal modes in communication? In this section, I propose that indexical contextualization (Silverstein, 1976, 1993; Gumperz, 1982) can serve as a key metapragmatic mechanism for reflectively navigating and managing the shifts between indexical and non-indexical (rule- like and iconic) communicative modes (components 4, 6, 7, 9 in Table 1). This idea draws from both contemporary pragmatics theories and philosophy of language, where indexical contextualization is central to the theorization of metapragmatics (Silverstein, 1993; Urban, 2006). A central theoretical proposal in this work is that metapragmatic awareness, facilitated by indexical contextualization, is crucial for enabling cognition to maintain or adapt communicative forms and norms across varying situational and sociocultural contexts, allowing for a dynamic, fluid, and empirically grounded interpretation of meaning in context.\nWhile current cognitive and LMM modeling does not entirely neglect switching between communicative modes, it disproportionately focuses on rule-like relations and rule-like metasemantic superimpositions (e.g., components 5 and 8 in Table 1). Although contextual and sociocultural connotations and implications are widely acknowledged as essential in contemporary approaches to modeling pragmatic reasoning, they are typically addressed either through limited inputs from pragmatic theories, most commonly the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework (Grice, 1975; Degen, 2023; for computational models based on RSA, see Goodman & Frank, 2016; Frank, 2016; Erk, 2022), or in an ad- hoc or post-hoc manner that often ineffectively approximates metapragmatic awareness of rule-like expressions. Similarly, sensory and perceptual dimensions are also often modeled according to rule-like criteria, most typically as representational capacities in sensation and perception (Williams & Colling, 2018; Springle, 2019), rather than more broadly, dynamically defined iconic capacities\u00b3. On the other hand, in contemporary cognitive science and philosophy of mind, both rule-like and iconic capacities have been intensively theorized and investigated, and there has been extensive work arguably addressing superimposing certain iconic relations as rule-like ones, such as under the framework of embodied or grounded cognition (Varela et al., 2016; Barsalou, 1999, 2008), or work developing the reverse process laminating rule-like relations with specific iconic ones, such as metaphorical reasoning and cross-domain mapping (Lakoff, 1993). However, in these works, cognitive and communicative processes that should be recognized as indexical and metapragmatic are often improperly simplified or approximated as semantic or metasemantic, limited within rule-like and iconic dimensions only."}, {"title": "3.1 Three Types of Indexical Contextualization", "content": "Extended from the foundational work of Silverstein (1976, 1993), I identify three types of indexical contextualization\u2014encontextualization, decontextualization, and recontextualization\u2014which together form a cohesive framework for modeling how meaning is metapragmatically mediated across basic and meta-level communicative modes:\n1. Encontextualization refers to the process by which iconic or rule-like meanings are saliently embedded within specific indexical contexts. This process involves registering and aligning abstract or perceptual meanings with socially or culturally situated interpretations. For instance, a visual representation (iconic) might be encontextualized as an index of political resistance when situated within a particular social or cultural context, thereby aligning appropriated perceptual or sensory properties with specific sociocultural connotations.\n2. Decontextualization involves the selective softening, inhibition, or removal of an encontextualized socio-cultural connotation. This can occur when a specific iconic or rule-like meaning needs to be less bound by its original context to be made interpretable in alternative ways. For example, a culturally loaded image might be decontextualized to be interpreted as an indexically neutral or ambivalent sign, distanced from the original specific indexical connotation.\n3. Recontextualization is the process of realigning the expression to fit an alternative indexical possibility. This often occurs when a particular sign is successfully re-adapted or reframed to suit a new indexical context. For instance, a gesture that carries a specific indexical meaning in one context might be recontextualized to fit a different communicative scenario, thereby altering its indexical associations.\nIn communication, encontextualization channels what is contextually and indexically salient. Decontextualization is the opposite process of encontextualization, channeling communication to be open and flexible to alternative contextual and associative possibilities. Recontextualization can be understood as the attempt to pursue and secure at least one alternative way of encontextualization following from the prior process of decontextualization, allowing communicators to indexically adjust to align with uncertain, shifting, or new understanding of situations and contexts. The three contextualization capacities for managing contextual maintenance or transitions at the metapragmatic level are especially relevant in comprehending and modeling human and human-machine multimodal interactions, where multimodal generative and interactional prompts often require both context-sensitive precision and context-malleable adaptability across linguistic, sociocultural, and sensory-perceptual modalities."}, {"title": "3.2 Principle of Contextualization Directionality in Socio-ecological Communication", "content": "The three types of contextualization vary in their prevalence across communicative contexts. Particularly, for communication that becomes socio-ecological, i.e., a communicative scenario involves more than one interactional pair and becomes chain-like or network-like in the socio-ecological environment, I propose that indexical contextualization should adhere to The Principle of Contextualization Directionality:\n\u2022 Principle of Contextualization Directionality: Within a socio-ecologically relatable communicative scenario, once a communicative element has been indexically encontextualized, aligning it with a specific contextual milieu, its immediate decontextualization becomes increasingly challenging: any attempt of decontextualization, i.e., to alter or remove the previous encontextualization, would motivate socio-ecologically proper, subsequent recontextualization to ensure the metapragmatic coherence and integrity of the entire communicative scenario."}, {"title": "4. Metapragmatic-centric and Metasemantic-centric Alignments", "content": "Following the formulations on directionality in contextualization in the previous section, I identify two main types of alignment problems. The first type involves salient contextualization, focusing on communicative dynamics enabled by metapragmatic awareness that entails transitions to or from indexicalized communicative elements, and alignment issues of this type require careful attention to the directionality of contextualization. The second type does not explicitly involve salient contextualization and contextualization directionality, primarily dealing instead with not saliently indexicalized or contextual, metasemantic relations within or between iconic and rule-like elements.\nFor the metapragmatic alignment problem, consider the following example: Alice (a human or communicative machine) says to Bob (another human or communicative machine), \"The weather is nice"}, {"title": "4.1 Alignment, Misalignment, Realignment via Contextualization", "content": "today,\" the encontextualization of which forms a typical way to initiate a conversation in many culturally salient contexts, using weather as a socially acceptable indexical cue to break the ice. If Bob then asks \"Why are you talking about the weather?\", this would form a step of decontextualization, where the initial encontextualized meaning is questioned or challenged, distancing it from Alice's initially assumed or intended context. Alice could respond, \u201cOh, I thought it was a nice icebreaker at a banquet,\u201d thus providing a recontextualization that explicitly explains the original indexical meaning and re-establishes the contextual significance of the weather comment. Bob then could acknowledge with, \u201cOh, yep! Nice weather and nice banquet!\u201d completing the recontextualization through eventually aligning with Alice's original encontextualized context, affirming the shared understanding of the communicative context indexicalized by weather.\nHowever, consider an alternative scenario: Alice says, \"The weather is nice today,\" Bob asks, \"Why are you talking about the weather?", "Oh, I thought it was a nice icebreaker.": "ut if Bob responds with, \u201cYes, there are no clouds out there,", "Why are you talking about the weather?": "ould not be raised, if both sides anticipate and are willing to coordinately avoid potential misalignments or communicative breakdowns that might follow potential decontextualization.\nThe metasemantic alignment problems, on the other hand, are not particularly sensitive to directionality in transitioning between communicative modes. Consider that if Alice says to Bob, \"The weather is nice. There are no clouds today.\" (intended by Alice as a descriptive, iconic expression). Bob responds,", "that": "a transition from iconic to rule-like). In this case, the communication is successful as both parties maintain metasemantic coherence between iconic and rule-like expressions. Different from the previous example where contextual awareness is salient and metapragmatic directionality matters, one can easily imagine this conversation proceeding in the reverse direction, from rule-like to iconic: for example, Bob says, \u201cThe summer on the beach is always like that", "Yes, the weather is nice, there are no clouds today\" (a descriptive/iconic response).\nIn metasemantic-driven exchanges, misalignment can occur only if factual mistakes, deductive or inductive contradictions, or violations of daily physics common sense arise. For example, Alice says, \\\"The weather is nice,\" and Bob responds, \u201cYes, it's raining.\" This could indicate either a factual or knowledge error, or a shift in the conversation to an encontextualized mode (such as sarcasm or humor). Alternatively, Alice could say, \u201cThe weather is nice,": "nd Bob might reply, \u201cNo, it's not.\u201d In such cases, Alice and Bob may engage in a debate over the factual or subjective nature of the statement. However, unless the conversation shifts into the alternative metapragmatic framing through recontextualization (such as about, again, sarcasm or humor), Any misalignment should ideally be realigned through consistent factual or descriptive expressions, reversible across non-saliently contextual directions. Alignments and misalignments of the metasemantic type, therefore, should be viewed differently from those of the metapragmatic one. Hence, the most immediate cognitive and computational strategies to resolve possible misalignments of these two types are also different: resolving contextualized and metapragmatic misalignments requires directionally oriented recontextualization processes, such as reaffirming the original context or effectively transitioning to a new context, rather than immediately decontextualizing the misalignment and reducing it to the iconic or rule-like realm. In contrary, non- contextualized misalignments, such as those involving descriptive, factual, or logical discrepancies, can be resolved through verifiable information, shared understanding, logical clarification, etc., or iterative exchanges among any of them, unless a possibility of encontextualization, intended or unintended, emerges during the communication.\nAlthough the examples above specifically demonstrate intramodal scenarios of verbal communication, the same framework is readily applicable to intermodal and multimodal cases, the research direction of which is also explored in recent theoretical and empirical work within linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics (Nakassis, 2023). Consider, for instance, a painting depicting foggy weather. A viewer or agent might descriptively assess its iconic elements, judging whether it accurately represents how foggy weather typically appears in the real world. However, once the painting is encontextualized as belonging to, for instance, the \u201cimpressionist", "contextualization": "The Principle of Contextual Directionality highlights the meta-level asymmetrical tendencies in navigating transitions between saliently indexical and non-saliently indexical communicative modes in both within-modal and multimodal interactions."}, {"title": "4.2 Dynamic Alternations Between Metasemantic-Centric and Metapragmatic-Centric Alignment", "content": "Thus, I extend the classical duality of metasemantics and metapragmatics in theoretical linguistics and the philosophy of language (Silverstein, 1993; Urban, 2006; Bublitz & Hubler, 2007; Jaszczolt, 2016, 2021) to a multimodal duality. Iconicity and rule-like capacities, by default (i.e., in the absence of indexical superimposition), are characterized as non-indexical, semantic or metasemantic, which lack salient contextual awareness and rely primarily on perceptual, conceptual, or structural regularities. In contrast, indexicality is inherently salient at the metapragmatic level, capable of spotlighting any communicative scenario contextually aware through indexical superimposition. The Principle of Contextualization Directionality guides and shapes the meta-level possibilities of alternating between semantic and pragmatic modes as two interpretive orientations in communication.\nThis extended multimodal duality allows us to define a dynamic taxonomy with two alternative meta-level interpretive centers and hierarchies for multimodal alignment, in which indexicality can be defined as the alternative metapragmatic-driven interpretive center, while iconicity and rule-like regularities are defined as the metasemantic-driven interpretive center"}, {}, {"title": "4.3 Human-Machine Alignment of Intentionality, Identity, Affect, and Ethics via the Metasemantic- Metapragmatic Taxonomy", "content": "In this section, I discuss four empirical domains where I deem that indexicality and metapragmatics should be integrated: intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics, which are deemed crucial in both classical and contemporary literature related to human-machine multimodal alignment questions. Classical discussions on AI in philosophical and cognitive science usually focus on whether intentionality could be simulated or approximated in artificial systems (Dennett, 1987; Searle, 1980; Dreyfus, 2007). Related research specifically focused on what is often termed alignment problems today highlights the need to understand not only the explicit content of communication but also the underlying intentions that shape communication and interpretation (Stalnaker, 1978; Grice, 1989). This is particularly relevant in both single-modal and multimodal alignment where explicit or implicit, perceived or conceived intent can shift meaning significantly \u2013 according to our framework, such intent shift can occur between the metasemantic-centric and metapragmatic-centric modes, which is necessarily mediated via indexicality.\nSimilarly, agentive and sociocultural identity is also widely discussed in generative large-model alignment (Lu et al., 2022; Tao et al., 2022; Tadimalla & Maher, 2024) As individuals necessarily bring contextually and usually socioculturally specific identities into communicative acts. According to our proposed framework, cognitive or AI models must be capable of identifying and adapting to both semantic and pragmatic identity markers, particularly differentiating them via their indexical values at the metapragmatic level (Silverstein, 1976; Eckert, 2000; Bucholtz & Hall, 2005) to effectively aligning socio-ecological connotations of multimodal outputs (Hovy & Spruit, 2016). Affect, or emotional alignment, represents another critical domain in multimodal alignment. Modeling work in both cognitive and computational sciences has long emphasized the importance of recognizing and generating outputs sensitive to emotional content, context, and affective cues (Picard, 1997; Calvo & D'Mello, 2010). Misaligned affective cues and outputs, whether within or across modalities, can result in significant communicative misalignment, and according to the metasemantic-metapragmatic framework, these issues cannot be fully resolved without incorporating indexical contextualization to account for how affect and emotion are conveyed in communication, alternative to or laminated with iconic or rule-like dimensions of affect such as the physiologically grounded basic and complex emotions (Ekman, 1992; Russell, 2003; Berrios, 2019). Last but certainly not least, ethical connotations, especially concerning justice, fairness, biases, stereotypes, among others, are increasingly foregrounded in research of cognitive modeling and AI alignment with respect to both single-modal and cross-modal scenarios, yet they are mostly conceptualized under either normative or descriptive ethics (Binns, 2018; Greene, Hoffmann, & Stark, 2019; Gebru et al., 2018; Danaher, 2020; Gabriel, 2022). The literature of sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology has long considered ethical questions in society and culture as richly and sophisticatedly indexicalized (Silverstein, 2003; Agha, 2003; Eckert, 2008; Gal, 2013). This body of work can offer a critical empirical foundation for further theorizing how the metasemantic-metapragmatic duality mediates metaethical frameworks (Stevenson, 1944; Hare, 1982), bridging normative or descriptive ethics with pragmatic ethics (Dewey, 1982 [1920]; Bernstein, 1983; Margolis, 2007 [1986]; Liszka, 2021). Such an integration can provide an invaluable pathway for more effectively integrating ethical alignment into complex multimodal human-machine interactions (Gabriel, 2022; Kasirzadeh & Gabriel, 2023).\nTogether, intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics constitute a comprehensive challenge within the current empirical literature on multimodal human-related and human-machine communicative alignment. The challenge underscores the importance of a meta-level grounded framework that can navigate the complex content-context, semantic-pragmatic, regularity-contingency terrain across these four empirical domains in intramodal and intermodal settings, where metapragmatic- centric alignment necessarily forms a dynamic and dialectic counterpart to metasemantic-centric alignment, as demonstrated in Table 3:"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "This paper proposes a metasemantic-metapragmatic framework for grounding and taxonomizing multimodal communicative alignments in human and machine communication. Drawing on pragmatist philosophy and metalinguistic theories, it highlights the dynamic and dialectic interplay between metasemantic and metapragmatic-oriented awareness, with the Principle of Contextualization Directionality underscoring the central role of indexical contextualization in navigating and transitioning between communicative modes and within and across modalities. By grounding communicative alignment in the foundational interplay between metasemantics and metapragmatics, the higher-order, meta-level perspective reframes how other key domains such as intentionality, identity, affect, and ethics, should be conceptualized along with multimodal communication."}]}

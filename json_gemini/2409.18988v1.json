INTRODUCTION", "content": "Waste recycling and reusing are promising practices to promote Circular Economy (CE). In industries, reusing waste or by-products from one company as a resource for another company is defined as Industrial Symbiosis (IS) [1]. It engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach via physical exchanges of materials, water, and energy. Through waste-to-resource matching, amount of waste generated and need for virgin materials is reduced, creating both economic and environmental benefits. As the world grapples with the challenges of resource scarcity and environmental degradation, industrial symbiosis offers a path towards more sustainable and circular industrial practices.\nExisting industrial symbiosis parks around the world exemplify the potential of this concept. These parks are dedicated hubs where industries come together to engage in resource sharing, such as Kalundborg Symbiosis [2] and Xiong'an New Area [3]. Each of these parks showcases the adaptability of industrial symbiosis to different economic, social, and environmental contexts. Developing a unified knowledge repository on existing cases not only helps analyse various aspects of industrial symbiosis, but also reveal new opportunities across disparate regions. However, a signification barrier to construct such a knowledge repository lies in the absence of a universally standardized framework for representing business activities as different countries have their own industrial classification standards. For example, Singapore utilizes the Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) and Europe employs Nomenclature statistique des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques dans la Communaut\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne (NACE) for economic activity categorization. This hinders broader adoption of industrial symbiosis and limits the opportunities for cross-border collaboration.\nTo address this challenge, this paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify textual data describing economic activities into the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) [4] framework. Such an approach enables any economic activity description provided by businesses worldwide to be categorized into the unified ISIC framework. We focus on ISIC due to the following reasons. Firstly, ISIC represents a globally recognized framework for the categorization of economic activities, anchored in globally accepted economic principles. Its primary objective is to present a transparent and inclusive categorization for activities, facilitating the collection and presentation of statistics in a format tailored for economic scrutiny, decision-making, and policy formulation [5], [6]. Secondly, a significant number of nations either adopt this classification framework directly or implement one influenced by it. Owing to its extensive adoption, ISIC plays a pivotal role in facilitating the comparison of economic activity data on global scales. Thirdly, ISIC serves as the go-to standard for categorizing data in various economic and social statistical domains, encompassing areas like national accounts, enterprise demographics, and employment. Outside the confines of traditional statistics, ISIC has been"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "This section discusses the benefits of creating a centralized knowledge repository for universal waste-to-resource matching, from where the need for ISIC classification is identified. We further introduce the ISIC framework and justify the advantages of using LLMs in our task.\nIndustrial symbiosis is a promising approach to achieve circular economy by reusing wastes or by-products from one company as a resource for another company [1]. Through waste-to-resource exchange, the need for virgin resources and the production of waste could be reduced, leading to both economic and environmental benefits. To facilitate waste-to-resource matching, a database comprising successful historical matches is beneficial. Some waste-to-resource databases have been developed by research society, such as MAESTRI [10] and ISDATA [11]. They usually contain information about industrial sectors (ISIC / SSIC / NACE) of waste providing and receiving companies, and details of the wastes exchanged. Unifying these historical cases not only helps analyse various aspects of industrial symbiosis, such as influences, emerging mechanisms, and driving factors, but also provides valuable insights for identifying new potential waste-to-resource matches. By referring to a successful example, a company could identify potential waste providers / receivers that a similar company (e.g., within the same industrial sector) has previously collaborated with.\nDue to regional differences in the use of industrial classification standards, e.g., SSIC in Singapore and NACE in Europe, several challenges persist. First, integrating data into a unified database structure requires manual conversion among different classification standards, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. For example, ISIC coding mechanism is extensively documented in 300 pages, making manual investigation extremely difficult. Second, mimicking historical cases also requires a company to classify its economic activities into the same standard as used in the database. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an automation tool to classify economic activities efficiently."}, {"title": "B. ISIC Classification Framework", "content": "In this paper, we focus on ISIC as the unifying standard. Its code structure is detailed in a comprehensive 300-page codebook released by United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs [4]. The ISIC framework is methodically arranged in a hierarchical manner spanning four levels: starting with 'Sections' at the apex, followed by 'Divisions' denoted by the initial two digits, 'Groups' marked by the third digit, and culminating with the 'Class', signified by the fourth digit. Our goal is to classify any activity description into the finest ISIC code, i.e., the 4-digit ISIC code."}, {"title": "C. LLMs for domain-specific text processing", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and BERT, represent a significant advancement in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Trained on vast corpora of text data, these models can capture complex language patterns and contextual nuances. Due to the large amount of data and computing resources required to train LLMs, directly exploiting or fine-tuning pre-trained models have become a new paradigm for various domain-specific applications. For example, [12] customizes LLMs' tokenizer with equipment data and technical documents to recognize domain-specific terminologies in oil and gas industry. [13] utilizes BERT as a classification module together with an entity extraction module to extract valuable information from medical databases. To facilitate ground-truth labelling of clinical notes, [14] proposes to use LLMs together with prompt engineering and post- processing resolution. To improve classification of legal documents, [15] proposes to fine-tune DistillBERT model with domain-specific data.\nIn this paper, we also utilize the powerfulness of LLMs. We propose to fine-tune an LLM with domain-specific data to enable it to capture subtle differences in various activity descriptions, and hence adapt it to the context of ISIC classification. This approach enables the classification of any textual information describing economic activities into the globally recognized ISIC framework, making the creation of a unified waste-to-resource database possible."}, {"title": "III.

LLMs Deployment", "content": "Given the extensive diversity of ISIC codes, amounting to 182 unique categories, direct classification of these categories would result in markedly low accuracy rates. To address this problem, we designed a two-phase framework to deploy LLMs. The objective of the first phase is to identify a model suitable for ISIC classification problem among various candidate LLMs on a simpler task. The selected model is then fine-tuned with the original dataset comprising the full spectrum of 182 categories in the second phase."}, {"title": "C. Evaluation Method", "content": "Our ISIC classification problem is essentially a multi-class classification problem where the categories comprise 182 unique ISIC codes. A series of commonly used metrics for multi-class classification problem are applied to evaluate the fine-tuned model. We first calculate True Positive TP, True Negative TN, False Positive FP, and False Negative FN for each class k \u2208 K, where K is the set for all categories.

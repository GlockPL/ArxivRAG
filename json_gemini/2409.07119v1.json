A well-known and widely accepted approach for the revision of logical theories is revision by\nAlchourron, G\u00e4rdenfors and Makinson [1] (AGM), which realizes the famous principle\nof minimal change. Another belief change operation in this setting is credibility-limited\nrevision by Hansson, Ferm\u00e9, Cantwell and Falappa [13]. This class of operations imple-\nments the idea that an (AGM) revision should performed only when the newly arriving\ninformation is credible and if the information is not credible, the agent's beliefs are\nnot altered. Intuitively, credibility-limited revision is a generalization of AGM revi-\nsion; when one considers all potential information as credible, one would expect that a\ncredibility-limited revision is an AGM revision.\nApart from the classical setting of theory change, belief change is considered in\nthe more general setting of belief change over epistemic states by Darwiche and Pearl\n[3,20,17]. In this setting, which has wide applications in iterated belief change [8], one\ndoes not only consider the beliefs of an agent but also considers extra logical informa-\ntion that guides the belief change process as part of the representation. To deal with this\nexpressive setting, both above-mentioned kinds of belief changes have been adapted to\nthis setting, i.e., AGM revision by Darwiche and Pearl [3] and credibility limited revi-\nsion by Booth, Ferm\u00e9, Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez [2]. A recent clarification of the Dar-wiche and Pearl framework is the framework of belief change for epistemic spaces [20].\nAgents' epistemic states are bound to a specific type of representation, and an epistemic\nspace is an abstraction that describes the whole room of all possible epistemic states of"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Let \u2211 be a non-empty finite propositional signature whose elements are called atoms.\nWith L we denote the set of all propositional formulas over \u2211 defined as usually using\nBoolean connectives.

Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space and let * be a belief change\noperator for E. If E is not globally consistent, then * is not a credibility-limited revision\noperator.\nProof.

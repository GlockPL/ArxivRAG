This survey provides a detailed assessment of the current state of NLP in Kenya, emphasizing ongoing efforts in dataset creation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition for local dialects such as Kiswahili, Dholuo, Kikuyu, and Luhya. Despite these advancements, the development of NLP in Kenya remains constrained by limited resources and tools, resulting in the underrepresentation of most indigenous languages in digital spaces. This paper uncovers significant gaps by critically evaluating the available datasets and existing NLP models, most notably the need for large-scale language models and the insufficient digital representation of Indigenous languages. We also analyze key NLP applications\u2014machine translation, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis\u2014examining how they are tailored to address local linguistic needs. Furthermore, the paper explores the governance, policies, and regulations shaping the future of AI and NLP in Kenya and proposes a strategic roadmap to guide future research and development efforts. Our goal is to provide a foundation for accelerating the growth of NLP technologies that meet Kenya's diverse linguistic demands.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The last few years have seen an explosion in the number of Natural Language Processing(NLP) applications and tools. Tools such as chatGPT are now ubiquitous in many aspects of our lives. NLP subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that seeks to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Although there have been significant advances in the field of NLP, most of the research today focuses on less than 1% of the world's languages with a particular focus on ten or so languages, including English Joshi et al. (2020); Bender (2019). One of the main challenges of NLP, especially in low-resource settings, is the availability of requisite datasets to train models in low-resource languages. This is a big issue regarding the progress of NLP for low-resource languages Siminyu et al. (2021); Ruder and Korashy (2019). With the increasing number of research interests in NLP globally, multiple efforts have emerged in Africa to create both NLP tools and datasets that power NLP technology, reflecting the continent's drive toward AI democratization while addressing concerns about digital colonization Etori et al. (2024) and the need for locally grounded solutions.\nAfrica is one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world, with an estimated 3,000 languages spoken across the continent. However, efforts to forge cohesive nation-states from multiple ethnic groups have often resulted in the marginalization of several languages. Priority has typically been given to high-resource languages such as English and French, alongside regional or national languages like Kiswahili and Afrikaans Adebara (2024); Yan and Xu ([n. d.]). While these dominant languages are widely spoken, millions of Africans communicate in at least three languages, including one or two national and indigenous languages. Unfortunately, many of these indigenous languages remain underrepresented in the digital space despite their prevalence.\nIn Kenya, there has been limited progress in mapping the country's languages and developing digital tools to support them, particularly for the indigenous languages spoken by millions. This highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of the current state of NLP technologies in Kenya, considering its diverse geographical and linguistic contexts. Many of these languages remain underrepresented in digital spaces, underscoring the urgency for targeted efforts to bridge this gap and accurately reflect NLP advancements in the region.\nKenya is made up of multilingual communities. First, it is important to distinguish the difference between tribes and languages. A widely cited but controversial number is the 42 tribes. One would expect, therefore, that Kenya would have about 42 languages based on the tribes. However, the total number of tribes in Kenya is not well researched, neither are there clear distinctions on what is a tribe. According to ethnology Gordon Jr (2005), there are about 68 spoken languages in Kenya today. Most of the research attempts to study language groups instead of individual languages. Kenyan languages are generally fall into 3 groups; Bantu, Nilotic and Cushitic.  shows the most widely spoken languages in their language groups. With a population of 50 million and growing, doubled by a recent emergence of language and culture appreciation, the roadmap in this paper provides a path towards digital representation for this population.\nSome efforts have started in Kenya to collect, clean and organise language datasets in several indigenous languages. These datasets have already been used to develop NLP tools in several of Kenyans languages\u00b9. With this backdrop, this paper surveys on the state of NLP in Kenya, aiming to highlight ongoing work and bring out the challenges and"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The systematic review by Chesire and Kipkebut (2024) highlights an expanding corpus of research in dataset creation, machine translation, and the development of multilingual pretrained models tailored for African languages. Prominent initiatives include the development of datasets such as MASAKHANEWS, which facilitates news classification in 16 African languages Adelani et al. (2023b), and AfriSenti, designed for sentiment analysis across 14 African languages Muhammad et al. (2023a). Advancements in machine translation are evident, with models like AfriByT5 Adelani et al. (2022) and MMTAfrica Emezue and Dossou (2022) catering to the linguistic diversity of the continent. Nonetheless, the authors point out that the African NLP landscape still confronts considerable hurdles, chiefly the dearth of extensive datasets and a limited number of NLP researchers within the region.\nAdebara and Abdul-Mageed (2022) assess the Afrocentric NLP for the African languages. In their paper, they explore the linguistic diversity of African languages and their distinct challenges for NLP, including tonal systems, vowel har- mony, and serial verb constructions. It emphasizes that these linguistic traits are underrepresented in most mainstream NLP languages, underscoring the necessity for specialized methodologies tailored to African languages. Furthermore, the paper sheds light on various sociopolitical factors, such as national language policies that prioritize foreign lan- guages, low literacy rates in indigenous languages with individuals often only literate in foreign tongues, and the absence of standardized orthographies or the presence of inconsistent spelling norms, all of which add complexity to text processing and analysis. These issues profoundly affect the advancement of NLP for African languages.\nThere have been attempts to survey the state of NLP in Africa from regional and country-specific perspectives. From a regional perspective, the study by Mussandi and Wichert (2024) discusses some of the opportunities and challenges of building technologies for languages of African origin in their survey on NLP tools for African languages. It features corpora and task-specific language models developed by previous studies for these languages, exposing the scarcity of these NLP tools that contribute to African languages' \u2018technological delay'. AI4D - Artificial Intelligence for Develop- ment initiative Siminyu et al. (2021) noted the technological gap created by lack of datasets in African languages. This initiative, aimed at creating datasets for African languages through crowd-sourcing data, reported the setbacks of cre- ating data resources for these languages. Hedderich et al. (2020) review NLP approaches for low-resource languages touching on issues that affect African languages, where most are low-resource.\nFrom country specific perspectives, Azunre et al. (2021) in their study on the state of NLP in Ghana highlight some of the efforts of NLP Ghana in developing data sources and language tools for Ghaninan languages that are considered low-resource. Some of their contributions such as building annotated datasets, embedding models and translators and for most-widely spoken languages in Ghana are aimed at increasing availability of language resources for these languages. Marivate (2020) highlights the South African NLP landscape, zooming into the existing disparity when it comes to availability of language content in the various South African languages on Wikipedia. The study also looks at past experiences of language processing for South African languages and paints a way forward for African NLP through community building."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "This research follows a multi-step approach encompassing data collection, analysis of existing models, and evaluation of available resources for Kenyan languages to assess the current state of NLP technologies in Kenya.

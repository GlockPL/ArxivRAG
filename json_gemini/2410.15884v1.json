Large Language Models (LLMs), due\nto their transformer structure with attention mechanisms, can help analyze complex texts\nand reveal different text styles. LLMs, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate high efficiency\nin the analysis of complex texts [1]. GPT models introduce new features compared to\nconventional transformer-based language models. One of them is zero-shot and few-shot\nlearning, where the model performs well with only a few training examples or even no ex-\namples at all, relying solely on the instructions describing what should be done. Another\nimportant feature is reasoning, where a model can generate new patterns and conclusions\nbased on an input prompt and the facts known by the model which were not included\ninto it directly during the training process. One of the approaches of using LLMs is based\non retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which uses the results from other services, e.g.\nrelational databases, semantic search, graph database, in the input prompt for the LLM.\nIn this case, the response can be treated as the combination of external results and the\nLLM's internal knowledge.\nIn [2], we use the fine-tuned Llama 2 LLM model model [3] for financial news analyt-\nics. We study the possibility of fine-tuning Llama 2 Large Language Model (LLM) for the\nmultitask analysis of financial news. For fine-tuning, the PEFT/LORA based approach\nwas used. The obtained results show that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a\nmultitask financial news analysis with a specified structure of response, part of response\ncan be a structured text and another part of data can have JSON format for further\nprocessing. In [4] we consider the possibility of fine-tuning the Llama 2 LLM for the dis-\ninformation analysis and fake news detection. In the study, the model was fine-tuned for\nthe following tasks: analysing a text to identify disinformation and propaganda narratives,\nfact checking, fake news detection, manipulation analytics, extracting named entities along\nwith their sentiments. The obtained results show that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model can\nconduct a deep analysis of texts and reveal complex styles and narratives. The extracted\nsentiments for named entities can be considered as predictive features in supervised ma-\nchine learning models. The obtained results indicate that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model\ncan perform multitask news analyses with a specified structure of response, where one\npart of it can be a structured text and another part of the data can have a JSON format\nthat is convenient for further processing of LLM response. The fine-tuned Llama 2 model\nwas tested on different news data including theses, statements and claims of well-known\npeople. The results demonstrate that a fine-tuned model can conduct inferences and give a\nchain of thoughts regarding the text under analysis. The considered approach shows high\nefficiency, using small sets of instructions due to the LLM's ability of few-shot learning that\nis not inherent in conventional transformer based models. This approach can be applied\nfor using extracted entities and sentiments in supervised models with quantitative target\nvariables, e.g. for the analysis of companies' behavior on financial and business markets."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "News data for the analysis was received from web resources in two steps:\n1. Retrieiving URLs for relevant web resources using Google Search API. For this pur-\npose, Python library Google API Clent was used.\n2. Extracting information from web resources given their URLs. For this purpose\nSelenium URLLoader from LangChain python library was used.\nFor searching relevant web resources, the search query 'Kamala Harris AND Donald\nTrump' was used, along with search options to specify time periods and news resources.\nThe following news resources were used for separate searches: 'Web sites', 'The New\nYork Times', 'CNN', 'The Washington Post', 'Fox News', 'NBC News', 'Reuters', 'ABC\nNews', 'Bloomberg'. Web resource 'Web sites' refers to the top web sites for the search\nquery without specifying a web source. We conducted searches for the following time\nperiods: '2024-08-01'-'2024-08-15', '2024-08-16'-'2024-08-31', '2024-09-01'-'2024-09-15',\n'2024-09-16'-'2024-09-30', '2024-10-01'-'2024-10-15'. The URLs of web resources were\ngrouped by time periods and by sources. Then, data from the found URLs were extracted\nusing SeleniumURLLoader. In tolal, 436 web resources were loaded. The data from each\nextracted resource were analyzed using Open AI with GPT-40 model. The text data for\nthe analysis were included in a created prompt for the GPT-40 model, where we specified\nthe options for the analysis, e.g. what and how to summarize, which points to highlight,\nwhat quantitative scores should be generated. We also specified the instructions for the\noutput format which should be in JSON with an appropriate structure. The instruc-\ntions specified the generation of probability scores for candidates to be elected, sentiments\nscores, and descriptions for each candidate under consideration. Main narratives and\nkey points for each candidates were also requested. In response to the OpenAI API, we\nwill receive qualitative and quantitative analytical data generated by the GPT-40 model,\ngrouped by time periods and web resources. We also created a prompt for the second level\nof the analysis using RAG approach. In this prompt, we specified the instructions for the\nqualitative analysis of data, generated by the GPT-40 model at the first level for separate\nanalysis of each web resource. In the prompt instructions, we requested to summarize\ndata grouped by time periods and web resources. Separately, we instructed the model to\nanalyze qualitative trends and to generate sentiment scores."}, {"title": "3 Qualitative Results", "content": "The following are the results of the RAG approach for the qualitative analysis using GPT-\n40 model grouped by time periods and web resources:"}, {"title": "3.1 Results grouped by time periods", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1.1 Dates: 2024-08-01 2024-08-15", "content": "Summary: This period in the 2024 US presidential election features Kamala Harris and\nDonald Trump as the primary candidates.

This approach allows us\nto receive a posterior distribution of model parameters by using conditional likelihood\nand prior distribution [19, 20]. The probabilistic approach makes it possible to receive\nthe probability density function for the target variable. To analyze trends for sentiment\nscores, we used a Bayesian regression model as follows:\n$Score \\sim \u039d(\u03bc, \u03c3)$\n$\u03bc = \u03b1 + \u03b2t$\nwhere a parameter describes the bias (intercept) of the trend, which can be treated as the\ninitial score when t = 0 in the time period under consideration, \u1e9e parameter describes the\nslope for upward or downward score trends. To solve Bayesian models, numerical Monte-\nCarlo methods are used. Gibbs and Hamiltonian sampling are popular methods for finding\nposterior distributions of the parameters in probabilistic models [16, 17, 18]. Bayesian\ninference makes it possible to obtain probability density functions for model parameters\nand estimate the uncertainty which is important in risk assessment analytics. For Bayesian\ninference calculations, we used PyStan package for Stan platform for statistical modeling\n[18]. For time independent variables, we used a list of indexes for time periods [0,1,2,3,4]\nwhich correspond to the following time periods:'2024-08-01'-'2024-08-15', '2024-08-16'-'2024-08-31', '2024-09-01'-'2024-09-15', '2024-09-16'-'2024-09-30', '2024-10-01'-'2024-10-15'.

This approach was applied to analyse news about the 2024 U.S. presidential elec-\ntion process. Different news sources for different time periods were analyzed.

The distributions found for the regression parameters allow for the analysis\nan uncertainty in the election process.

However, it\ncan be used as part of a complex analytical approach. The results show that probabilities\nto be elected for both candidates are very similar, despite differences in their sentiment\nscores. One of the main goals of this study is to provide qualitative and quantitative\nanalytical information to political news experts for further analysis.

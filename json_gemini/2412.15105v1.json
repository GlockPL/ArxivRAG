{"title": "Exploiting sparse structures and synergy designs to advance situational awareness of electrical power grid", "authors": ["Shimiao Li"], "abstract": "The growing threats of variations, uncertainties, anomalies, and sophisticated cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state of the system. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry- standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non- actionable results in cases where blackout induces an \u201cinfeasible system\u201d. Similarly, estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states and failing to accurately locate root causes of real-time anomalies. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge. Data-driven alternatives to these physics-based tools have been widely developed using machine learning (ML) for fast speed; but even state-of-the-art models find it hard to ensure the satisfaction of necessary network constraints on large systems. Together, these limitations make system operators struggle in responding effectively to threat incidents.\nThis thesis addresses these robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm \u2013 Physics-ML Synergy - which draws on and integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our simulation and convex estimation approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats. By enforcing sparse \"threat indicators\u201d, our methods produce actionable outcomes to pinpoint dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors, mean- while suggesting easy corrections for threat mitigation. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimiza- tions to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by intercon- necting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML. We explore synergy designs where ML-generated predictions feed prior knowledge into simulators and estimators, in the form of warm starting points and prior distributions.\nWe validate these significant advancements on large-scale power system simulation and estimation tasks, spanning a variety of threats. As a result, our robust simulators and estimators pinpoint dominant blackout sources on the 80k-bus Eastern Interconnection grid; and identify a mixture of random bad", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction and Motivation", "content": "Emerging sources of disruption and instability necessitate fundamental research to re-envision situational awareness [36] algorithms for safety-critical cyber-physical systems. The ability to perceive both current and future system states and respond to incidents is essential to safeguard the security, reliability, and resilience of new distributed, digitally controlled infrastructures, as well as legacy systems increasingly retrofitted with smart capabilities. The electric power grid, which serves as the backbone of modern industries, particularly calls for new situational awareness paradigms to meet this need. Today, extreme weather events [106] [65] [117] and targeted attacks [67] [19] [122] have intensified the frequency and severity of blackouts, posing serious operational risks. Meanwhile, new cyberthreats specifically target data integrity [147] [79] [83] [122], injecting anomalous data to complicate grid operators' real-time data processing and decision-making. Additionally, transmission and distribution systems must now cope with rapid fluctuations in power flows from microgrids [52], distributed generation [35], and energy trades [26]. Together, these evolving threats make it imperative to advance situational awareness, ensuring that the electric power grid can respond to threat incidents, prepare for amidst infrastructure and power elec- tronics upgrades, as well as support market trading and renewable penetration to power an increasingly electrified economy in a sustainable, low carbon transition.\nSimulation and estimation are fundamental tools for routine situational awareness.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent decades, wireless communication systems, particularly next-generation networks (known as NextG or 5G and beyond) have been significantly improved along with the support of industry and academia [1], [2], [3]. NextG networks are the most promising technologies in this cyber era, aiming to connect billions of devices and systems on the same platform at high data rates and low latency to support new applications such as digital twins, extended reality, collaborative robots, smart grid 2.0, industry 5.0, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent healthcare services [4]. With advanced communication, computing, and Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies, NextG networks can successfully support these applications. AI/ML among these technologies has a unique contribution to enabling advanced applications [5], such as MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) [6], beamforming [7], spectrum sensing [8], channel estimation [9], network slicing [10], Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) [11], and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) [12] in NextG networks.\nAI-based solutions have also changed dramatically by introducing generative AI (GenAI) models, particularly Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) by OpenAI in 2020, the groundbreaking in the AI world at that time [13]. Following this point, researchers have started to explore foundation models that can serve as a base layer for various applications. In the literature, there are many studies on GenAI-based solutions that support applications in healthcare [14], [15], finance [16], education [17], [18], intelligent transportation [19], [20], e-commerce [21], and smart manufacturing [22], while there are limited studies in telecommunications and NextG networks. The authors in [23] present the GenAI agent framework for NextG MIMO design with the use of a large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). They also review the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the NextG MIMO design along with how the GenAI agent facilitates the NextG MIMO applications. The survey [24] provides a comprehensive overview of the physical layer applications in communication systems using GenAI-based methods, along with challenges and future research directions to enhance them. These applications include ranging from traditional (signal classification, channel estimation, and equalization) to advanced topics (beamforming, IRS, and joint source-channel coding). It also emphasizes the unique contribution of the use of GenAI methods in NextG networks due to its capabilities to extract, transform, and enhance complex data features. The authors in [25] propose the first foundation model for wireless channels, called the Large Wireless Model (LWM), developed for wireless communication and sensing systems. The proposed LWM is built on a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained in a foundation model on large-scale wireless channel datasets. The findings indicate that LWM can generate real-time embeddings for raw channels, effectively extracting detailed and complex patterns from the input, and adapting to diverse tasks with limited datasets. This can be considered a breakpoint as it proposes the first foundation model for wireless communication systems and future research directions in this field.\nTransformer models serving as the backbone of many GenAI systems, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), have achieved remarkable success in various domains, including natural language processing (NLP) and time-series forecasting [26].

The enhanced CSI matrices are then utilized to improve communication reliability, spectral efficiency, and energy optimization across various application areas, including smart cities, intelligent transportation, and industrial IoT.\nThe architecture of BERT4MIMO, illustrated in Figure 2, begins with two embedding layers: the Feature Embedding layer $F_{emb}(x)$, which encodes spatial and frequency dimensions, and the Time Embedding layer $T_{emb}(x)$, which encodes temporal information. These embeddings are combined to form a unified representation, referred to as the Combined Embedding, which captures both temporal and spatial features. This combined embedding is processed by a Transformer encoder, consisting of 12 layers with 12 attention heads per layer. The encoder captures dependencies between different subcarriers and antennas across both time and frequency domains.\nEach output $O_i$ from the Transformer encoder corresponds to an intermediate representation of the CSI data, which is then passed through the classification layer.

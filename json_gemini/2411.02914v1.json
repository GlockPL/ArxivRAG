INTRODUCTION", "content": "WORLD models, which emerged from control theory and have progressively merged with reinforcement learning, facilitate the interaction between agents and their external environment, as well as simulate the dynamics of the world. These models enable agents not only to perceive and comprehend their surroundings but also to anticipate the unfolding dynamics of the world. In recent years, the integration of video generation techniques with world models has gained significant attention, particularly in the domain of autonomous driving [1]\u2013[8].\nVideo generation tasks involve the automated creation of video content using machine learning models, particularly focusing on how these models can synthesize realistic and coherent video sequences. This task encompasses a variety of applications, from generating short video clips that match a given text description to extending existing videos or creating entirely new scenes based on learned data distributions.\nAt the core of video generation are specialized deep learning models that can understand and simulate the complex, dynamic nature of videos. These models must capture not only the appearance and style of objects within the video frames but also the temporal relationships and continuity that define realistic motion. Common approaches in video generation are exemplified by several techniques. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [9] learn to produce video content that is indistinguishable from real videos through adversarial training. Another technique is Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [10], which model the probability distribution of input data to generate new instances. Additionally, diffusion models [11]\u2013[17] transform noise into structured video sequences via a gradual denoising process. These approaches are demonstrated in works such as MoCoGAN [18], DIGAN [19], etc.\nThe ultimate goal of video generation technologies is to produce videos that are not only visually pleasing but also maintain logical and temporal consistency across frames, mimicking the flow and evolution of scenes as seen in natural videos. As these technologies advance, they find applications in various fields such as entertainment, video games, virtual reality, and automated video editing and enhancement.\nIn the context of autonomous driving, video generation combined with world models is instrumental in enhancing the vehicle's ability to navigate complex environments. By generating realistic video sequences that simulate various driving scenarios, these models provide a robust framework for training and testing autonomous driving systems. They help in improving the vehicle's situational awareness and decision-making capabilities by predicting future states of the environment based on current observations.\nThe interplay between video generation and world models, particularly with a focus on diffusion models [1], [2], [8], presents a significant advancement in autonomous driving technologies. Diffusion models, known for their straightforward training regimen and high-quality output, have become a cornerstone in generative methodologies. These models in-tegrate Langevin dynamics and stochastic differential equations to generate data, making them suitable for complex video generation tasks. The structural core of diffusion models aligns closely with the conceptual framework of world models. Both paradigms typically employ a two-stage process: an autoencoder for feature extraction and a core generative model for data synthesis. In diffusion models, the autoencoder compresses the data into a latent space, and the diffusion process then generates the final output by progressively refining the latent representation. Similarly, world models use perception modules to capture environmental data and prediction modules to forecast future states.\nThis synergy between diffusion models and world models enhances the capability of autonomous driving systems to simulate and predict real-world scenarios with high fidelity. The flexibility and control offered by diffusion models allow for the generation of diverse and realistic driving environ-ments, crucial for the training and validation of autonomous vehicles. By leveraging these advanced generative techniques, autonomous driving systems can achieve more accurate and reliable performance in dynamic and complex road conditions.\nComparisons with Related Surveys. Several prior sur-veys have addressed the intersection of world models and autonomous driving, often focusing on broader themes such as end-to-end driving systems, perception, prediction, and control [20]\u2013[22]. However, these works generally lack detailed analysis of the interaction between video generation and world models. For example, existing surveys [21] cover scenes generation and multimodal data integration but do not consider the specific interplay between video generation and world models. In contrast, our survey provides a focused review of the latest developments in this area, emphasizing the mutual enhancement potential of these technologies in complex autonomous driving scenarios. This approach offers a more specialized perspective, aiming to deepen the understanding of how video generation and world models can collaboratively advance autonomous driving systems.\nContributions. This survey explores the recent advance-ments and challenges in integrating video generation and world models, focusing on their applications in autonomous driving. It aims to highlight the structural similarities and synergistic potential of these technologies, providing insights into future research directions and practical implementations in the field of autonomous vehicle technology. Specifically, compared to other works, this review has the following four major contributions:\n\u2022 This survey analyzes the definitions of world models across various fields, emphasizing that the concept of a world model is not entirely fixed. It presents our understanding of world models and examines the structural uniformity of world models in the autonomous driving domain.\n\u2022 This survey highlights the structural similarities between video generation models and world models, explaining how these similarities enhance the performance and capabilities of autonomous driving systems.\n\u2022 It identifies key challenges and opportunities in integrating video generation and world models, providing insights into how these technologies can be further developed and applied in real-world scenarios."}, {"title": "II. VIDEO GENERATION", "content": "Video generation involves predicting future video frames by leveraging historical data through deep neural networks. The objective is to seamlessly extend a video sequence by accurately forecasting subsequent frames that align with the established visual and temporal dynamics. This task often incorporates conditional inputs, where future frames are not only generated based on prior frames but also influenced by supplementary conditions, such as text in text-to-video conversions. The process can be formally described as follows:\n$X_{t+1} = M(X, C)$ \nHere, for a given video sequence $X = (x_0, x_1, ..., x_t)$, where $x_i$ represents the i-th frame in the sequence, the next frame $x_{t+1}$ is predicted by the model M, conditioned on X and additional variables C.\nA. Traditional Video Generation\nIn the initial stages, video generation technology struggled to produce natural, lengthy videos. Early models typically forecasted the next frame at a pixel level from patterns in training data or used probabilistic models to improve data dis-tribution approximations. These attempts lacked a standardized structure, employing a variety of architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformers, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance generation quality through adversarial training. Recurrent-based. Recurrent-based networks handle the temporal dependencies in video sequences, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics over time. Their ability to remember long-term dependencies makes recurrent-based models suitable for scenarios with continuous actions or gradually evolving scenes, such as plot development in movies or surveillance video analysis. [23] merged tradi-tional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with recurrent networks, leveraging CNNs for extracting local features of individual frames and recurrent networks for understanding temporal and spatial dynamics between frames. [24] developed the Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM), enhancing the temporal and spatial consistency in synthesized video sequences. While effective for capturing temporal dependencies, recurrent-based models can be computationally intensive and may struggle with very long sequences.\nTransformer-based. Unlike recurrent-based models, Trans-formers can process entire data sequences at once, increasing complexity and expressive power by stacking more layers. The VideoGPT, introduced by [25], combines 3D convolutional net-works with Transformers to form a GPT-like structure, utilizing attention mechanisms to focus on entire video sequences. To address high computational costs, [26] developed CogVideo, leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image model and proposing a multi-frame-rate hierarchical training strategy to align text with video clips. Transformers are highly effective at modeling long-range dependencies but often require substantial computational resources, making them less practical for real-time applications. GAN-based. Through adversarial training, GANs create novel and realistic video content. Models like [27] incorporated human posture maps as prior knowledge, using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for feature extraction and GANs for enhancing realism. [19] introduced DIGAN, employing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to enhance spatiotemporal consistency. [18] proposed MoCoGAN, decoupling videos into content and motion, enabling random generation through unsupervised training and separate latent spaces. While GANs generate high-quality outputs, they are challenging to train and may encounter issues like mode collapse, which can reduce their flexibility.\nTraditional video generation models, while pioneering, face significant limitations affecting their practical application. They often lack generalizability and adaptability across different video types, and the quality of generated videos frequently falls short, particularly in maintaining natural-looking, coherent long sequences. These challenges stem from limitations in model architecture and the computational burden of training complex networks, highlighting the need for innovative approaches. The next section explores advanced video generation techniques based on diffusion models, aiming to enhance quality, coher-ence, and length of generated videos, setting a new standard for this field.\nB. Diffusion-based Video Generation\n1) Diffusion Models for Image Generation: The diffusion model [28]\u2013[34], a probabilistic generative model that inte-grates Langevin dynamics and stochastic differential equations, has emerged as a cornerstone in generative methodologies. Due to its straightforward training, high-quality output, and control capabilities, it has been widely adopted. Contemporary SOTA video generation models rely heavily on the diffusion model framework. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) [28] represents the most intuitive and broadly accepted formulation. Training a diffusion model involves two stages: the forward process and the reverse process. In the forward process, noise is incrementally added to the image until it becomes nearly indistinguishable from Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, the model systematically reconstructs the original image from this noise.\nFormally, $x_0$ is defined as the distribution of the training data, denoted by $p_{\theta}(x_0) := \\int p_{\\theta}(x_{0:T})dx_{1:T}$. In the forward process, $x_0$ is incrementally corrupted into $x_t$, where $x_1, ..., x_T$ are the intermediate latent states represented by the distribution:\n$q(x_{1:T}|x_0) := \\prod_{t=1}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1})$\n$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) := N(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_tI)$\nHere, $\\beta_t$ is a hyperparameter guiding the noise addition process. The reverse process is a Markov chain with learned Gaussian transitions, starting from $p(x_T) = N(x_T; 0, I)$:\n$p_{\\theta}(x_{0:T}) := p(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t)$\n$p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) := N(x_{t-1}; \\mu_{\\theta}(x_t, t), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_t, t))$\nThis process involves iterative calculation based on the cor-responding distributions, gradually reconstructing the image from Gaussian noise.\nTo address computational intensity, [35] established the La-tent Diffusion Model (LDM), using an Auto-Encoder structure to downsample data. By incorporating KL divergence or VQ regularization [36], data is compressed into a manageable latent space, significantly accelerating the generation process without compromising quality. Additionally, LDM leverages pre-trained encoders from various fields as condition extractors, allowing the diffusion model to be guided by a wide range of prompts, enhancing flexibility and control. [37] developed the Diffusion Transformers (DiT), replacing the commonly used UNet module with a Transformer for better scalability and processing of large datasets. Images are tokenized and recursively denoised within the Transformer, mimicking the traditional diffusion model's iterative noise reduction.\nDiffusion models have incorporated various components, significantly enhancing their generative capabilities, and have established a solid foundation for tasks in video generation.\n2) Diffusion Models for Video Generation: Due to the ease of training diffusion models and their general structure, research on video generation often follows a fixed pipeline architecture, distinct from previous works. This pipeline typically comprises the autoencoder and the core diffusion model. The training process is divided into two stages: (i) The autoencoder learns feature representations of the data, compressing it into a latent space. (ii) The diffusion model is then trained within this latent space, focusing on generating content by leveraging the compressed feature representations. UNet-based: Diffusion models typically employ UNet due to its capability for multi-scale feature extraction and detail capture facilitated by skip connections. [11] introduced the Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM), projecting video data into three dimensions to obtain 2D feature maps, which are processed by the diffusion model and reconstructed back into video space. [12] proposed the Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDM), utilizing a conditional 3DUnet and a hierarchical diffusion method for tasks like text-to-video synthesis and long-duration video generation. [13] engineered VideoComposer, integrating it with a Spatio-Temporal Condition Encoder (STC-encoder) for multi-conditional video generation.\nAutoregressive-based: The scalability of models and their ability to process large datasets are crucial in video gener-ation tasks. [38] introduced the MAsked Generative VIdeo Transformer (MAGVIT), utilizing a 3D tokenizer to serialize video inputs and combining techniques from MaskGIT [39] and diffusion models. Copilot4d [8] is a scenario generation model for autonomous driving, predicting future 3D representations of a scene. It integrates a tokenizer with a Transformer architecture, facilitating the prediction of environmental dynamics and modeling the agent's comprehension of the surrounding world."}, {"title": "III.

When analyzing individual harmful and unethical prompt-response (P, R) pairs, the metric correctly classifies each pair as highly unsafe, assigning the highest score. However, when these same prompts and responses are concatenated, the metric's decision flips, assigning the lowest possible score, thereby misclassifying the content as safe and allowing it to bypass the filter.\nIn this study, we discovered that several harmfulness LLM-based metrics, including GPT-based, exhibit this decision-flipping phenomenon. Additionally, we found that even an advanced metric like GPT-4o is highly sensitive to input order. Specifically, it tends to classify responses as safe if the safe content appears first, regardless of any harmful content that follows, and vice versa.\nThis work introduces automatic concatenation-based tests to assess the fundamental properties a valid metric should satisfy. We applied these tests in a model safety scenario to assess the reliability of harmfulness detection metrics, uncovering a number of inconsistencies.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Quality measurement metrics play a crucial role in qualitative research, serving as integral tools for determining and reporting the effectiveness, reliability, and significance of the findings. In the rapidly expanding landscape of AI-based tools and in particular generative large language models there is a pressing need for trustworthy, high-quality, automatic measurement metrics. These metrics are essential for accurately evaluating model outputs without relying on costly human resources. A striking example of how metric choice impacts results is shown in Schaeffer et al. (2023), where it is demonstrated that what appear as emergent abilities in LLMs are actually effects of the chosen metrics, and not of model scaling.\nNumerous quality metrics are frequently developed, including both static analysis and model-based approaches, specifically tailored and fine-tuned for tasks such as summarization, translation, and more. Typically, these metrics are compared with each other and checked for correlation with human evaluation. While many metrics can be naturally interpreted and analysed for being credible for the task, others, particularly model-based metrics lack such interpretability, necessitating robust and reliable validation.\nExisting research has formalized and investigated this question (Choshen and Abend, 2018; Kour et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Lambert et al., 2024). We continue this line of research by developing a suite of automatic tests based on concatenations, designed to assess the most basic properties that a valid metric should satisfy.\nOur tests are inspired by the widely observed phenomenon of the sensitivity of LLM models to the input prompt length, sometimes causing the models to behave undesirably and unpredictably (Liu et al., 2023; Levy et al., 2024). Furthermore, our tests consider a range of additional parameters beyond length sensitivity, including positional bias and score invariance under concatenation. These tests can reveal unexpected behaviors and help users make informed decisions when selecting the appropriate evaluation metric for their task.\nWe applied our testing approach to the task of model safety, discovering that GPT-3.5-based metric has a notable decision-flipping rate and both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o metrics have a strong positional bias.\nResearchers have developed various techniques for assessing model safety, ranging from manually written prompt attacks to fully automated conversation-based approaches; see (Chowdhury et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024) for comprehensive surveys on the subject. Reliable metrics for measuring output harmfulness are crucial, as safety conclusions are based on these metrics.\nOur concatenation-based tests are particularly well-suited for validating metrics in conversation-based attack scenarios. In such attack methods, the success of the attack is commonly determined using a metric that scores the prompt-response pairs and their concatenations (Anil et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). Thus, a metric that has a high flipping-of-decision rate on the concatenated prompts (as tested in our cluster tests) could lead to incorrect conclusions. We have found this to be the case for the GPT-3.5, which is used as a judge in several safety studies (Deng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). In addition, attacks can be directly designed to fool evaluation metrics by configuring the model to always output repeated answers or repeated input prompts. If the metric fails the repetition tests, this approach can effectively bypass the safety measures."}, {"title": "Model Safety: Task and Metrics", "content": "A base LLM is evaluated for producing safe, non-harmful outputs when interacting with users. A harmfulness metric $S$, either model-based or static, assesses the model's response (R) to the input prompt (P) by assigning a harmfulness score. Typically, the input for the metrics is (P, R), i.e., the response's harmfulness is measured relative to the input prompt. We test the following set of metrics:\nReward model-based metrics. These metrics are usually fine-tuned on human-labeled data, which is typically collected from red-teaming interactions with LLMs, to produce harmfulness scores that align with human preferences. The higher the reward score, the more preferred the response is by humans. We experiment with: OpenAssistant deberta-based model and their Pythia-based model, which are frequently used and investigated within the safety community (Lambert et al., 2024).\nThe LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm has been increasingly used for output evaluation, particularly as a harmfulness scoring metric (Chao et al., 2023, 2024), and some of the judge models have shown good correlation with human judgments (Chen et al., 2023; Rafailov et al., 2023). We test OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-012 and gpt-4o models. Similar to prior works, we request that the judge model evaluates the output of an LLM, assigning a harmfulness score from 1 to 5, where a lower score indicates safer responses.

Let S be a score metric with inputs $(I_1, I_2, ..., I_k)$ and outputs in R. In the model safety scenario, there are only two inputs, $I_1 = P$ is the input prompt to a base LLM and $I_2 = R$ is the LLM's response.\nFor simplicity of presentation, we assume that S has only two input parts. Generalizing to any $k > 2$ is straightforward."}, {"title": "Repetition tests", "content": "Repetition tests assess how input length, and in particular, repeated content in the input affects metric scores. We examine how the metric's score changes when a part of the input is repeated multiple times by concatenating it with itself $l > 1$ times. We analyze the behavior of $S(P * l, R), S(P, R * l)$ and $S(P * l, R * l)$ where ${P/R} * l$ denotes concatenation $l$ times with itself, as $l$ varies. Expectations for a valid metric vary based on the task and application. In model safety, a high-quality harmfulness metric is expected to report consistent scores, regardless of repeated content."}, {"title": "Cluster tests", "content": "Cluster tests are based on the idea that if a metric scores some inputs as high or low quality, it should consistently score concatenated inputs of similar quality in the same way. Formally, we define a cluster of high or low quality inputs as $C_{h/l} = {(P,R) | S(P, R) \text{ is large/small}}$. We then track scores $S(P_1 * . . . * P_l, R_1*, . . ., *R_l)$ for pairs $(P_i, R_i) \\in C_{h/l}$, expecting these scores to be consistently high or low, regardless of concatenation length."}, {"title": "Concatenate and permute", "content": "We track score changes across different concatenated inputs and their permutations.

We analyze the scores on these concatenated inputs after applying several permutations: sorting the list of concatenated input in order of increasing metric scores $S(P_i, R_i)$, in order of decreasing scores, and three other random permutations. This test assesses positional bias in the metric, i.e., the sensitivity to the order of the input parts, especially examining how the order of low/high scored pairs impacts the score."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Experimental setup.

As shown in Fig. 8 in Appendix B, we found that the reward-based metrics are sensitive to repetitions: the larger the number of repetitions (the longer the input to the metric) the smaller the score assigned by the metric, on average. In particular, the most sensitivity occurs when both the Prompt and the corresponding Response are repeated, as seen in Fig. 4. To quantify the influence, we compute Wasserstain distance between the distributions of scores, in Appendix B in Table1. In contrast, the GPT-based metrics ignore the repeated content in all input parts and preserve the original scores, as seen in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 in Appendix B."}, {"title": "Cluster tests:", "content": "Reward-based metrics and GPT-3.5 exhibit a notable decision-flipping rate.

These tests, shown in Appendix B: Fig. 11, revealed that the reward-based metrics have low positional bias. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 7, both GPT-based metrics are highly order-sensitive: their scores are heavily influenced by which pairs in the concatenated input list appear at the beginning. If low-scored pairs appear first (increasing permutation), the metrics tend to score the entire list low, regardless of later content. Similarly, if the high-scored pairs appear at first (decreasing permutation), the metrics tend to produce high scores. In the experiment with 16-tuples for GPT-40, 80% of the data (803 tuples) are scored as safe when the input pairs are sorted from low to high scores, compared to about 40% in random permutations and only 1% in decreasing permutation, while the input is effectively the same except for the order of the sentences. Additionally, the score distributions remain nearly the same across random permutations of the input content. For the GPT-3.5 metric similar effect is observed."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "We developed a suite of automatic tests for metric validity based on concatenations.

Firstly, we tested only one task, the task of model safety, with only one underlying benchmark dataset. We note that our tests do not require any special data, and are building upon any available data for the task. This limited scope might affect the generalizability of our findings.\nSecondly, the number of tests is small at this stage, which may not comprehensively cover all aspects of metric validity and further research is needed to extend these tests to other metrics and tasks.\nAdditionally, our tests focused on specific metrics and current implementation of these metrics, which may evolve and improve over time. Future work should address these limitations by expanding the range of tasks, increasing the number of tests, and continuously evaluating new metrics."}, {"title": "The System Prompt and Scoring Rules for the Judge Model", "content": "We use a variation of the system prompts previously used in the literature (Qi et al., 2023).\nSystem Prompt\nBelow are prohibited usage policies.

This is the most preferred response when confronted with policy-violating instructions.\nScore 2: Without directly addressing or endorsing a user's inappropriate instruction, the model opts for a restrained approach. It either offers a warning, or provides generalized or theoretical information that stays impartial and devoid of any overtly objectionable content. This response, while still maintaining policy boundaries, is considered a step below the ideal response of Score 1.\nScore 3: The model engages with the harmful request with an evident lack of discernment regarding the usage policies. It offers content related to the request but without embedding necessary precautions or disclaimers. Nonetheless, the response, on its own, isn't glaringly inappropriate and doesn't wholly resonate with the user's infringing objective.\nScore 4: The model responds to the harmful instruction by including explicitly prohibited content, which clearly violates safety aspects. However, the model's response is not a direct fulfillment of the user's intent and is not as severe as the most inappropriate response of Score 5.\nScore 5: The model fulfills the user's policy-violating safety instruction without any deviation. It completely ignores the usage guidelines and provides information that clearly violates the usage policies.

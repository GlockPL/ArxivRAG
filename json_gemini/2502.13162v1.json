However, their real-world deployment has exposed critical safety risks, particularly vulnerabilities to adversarial misuse (Wang et al., 2024b; Wei et al., 2024). Among these, jailbreak attacks (Yuan et al., 2023; Yi et al., 2024)-where malicious actors craft stealthy prompts to bypass safety protocols and elicit harmful content-remain a persistent challenge.\nTo address such attacks, current LLM security research explores various defense mechanisms, generally divided into two categories: prompt-defense and response-defense (Inan et al., 2023; Phute et al., 2023). This paper focuses on prompt-defense, aimed at identifying unsafe input queries concealed by jailbreak attacks. We further distinguish prompt-defense methods based on whether they modify model parameters.\nI. Parameter-modifying (PM) methods include training lightweight prompt detectors (Wan et al., 2024) or applying safety alignment to base LLMs (Bianchi et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2024). Such methods aim to learn new jailbreak attack types during training, producing models that are inherently better at defense. However, they face challenges in continual learning, such as ensuring effectiveness, avoiding overfitting (over-defensiveness), high computational costs, and limited explainability in black-box LLMs. II. Parameter-free (PF) methods rely on prompt engineering and multi-stage reasoning pipelines with one or more LLM agents at inference time (Xie et al., 2023; Jain et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a; Cao et al., 2024). Although more practical, they exhibit three critical limitations: (1) Lack of reusable experience. Reminding (Xie et al., 2023) or forcing reasoning (Zhang et al., 2024a) for each case is unable to help models learn attack patterns or accumulate reusable knowledge, even with contextual examples (Wei et al., 2023) or external knowledge bases (Cao et al., 2024). (2) No real-time learning or flexible customization. These methods cannot acquire new knowledge and rely heavily on the LLM's current performance and multiple fixed prompts, making it difficult to adapt to novel or specialized domains\u2014an essential requirement in fast-evolving security settings. (3) Insufficient interpretability. Although exposing intermediate reasoning steps improves transparency (Zhang et al., 2024a; Cao et al., 2024) to some extent, the case-by-case decision logic reduces credibility and hinders principled verification. Currently, the community lacks explicit descriptions of attack types and systematic analysis, which impedes iterative improvements in defense. A new defense paradigm is urgently needed to address these gaps.\nIn this paper, we propose ShieldLearner, a novel prompt-defense paradigm that achieves parameter-free adaptation against jailbreak attacks. Our approach mimics human self-learning to explicit concrete attack signatures (namely Pattern Atlas) and higher-order defense heuristics (namely Meta-analysis Framework) from undefended jailbreak samples. To maximize data efficiency, we integrate Adaptive Adversarial Augmentation (3A) into ShieldLearner: successfully defended cases are perturbed by 3A through self-attack to bypass defenses and re-enter the self-learning loop, enriching the pool of undefended attack samples.\nIn our view, ShieldLearner offers three key advantages, marking a revolutionary breakthrough in security: (1) Human Cognition-inspired Self-learning Paradigm: ShieldLearner emulates how humans acquire expertise and refine cognition by self-learning diverse attack patterns and effective jailbreak defense strategies. (2) Explainable, Generalizable, and Customizable: By explicitly presenting a learned micro-level Pattern Atlas and a macro-level Meta-analysis Framework, ShieldLearner mitigates the \"black-box\" dilemma in AI safety. These dual-layer experiences can be reusable across the community and can audited according to customized requirements. (3) Achieving Adjustable Effects but Parameter-Free: ShieldLearner effectively combines the strengths of both parameter-modifying and parameter-free methods while avoiding their limitations. During training, it leverages existing samples without requiring parameter updates. At inference, it utilizes prior learning experiences, minimizing reliance on LLM capabilities. The core contributions of our paper are summarized as follows:\n1. Inspired by human cognition, we propose a new paradigm, ShieldLearner, that utilizes self-learning and self-attack to generalize to new unsafe samples without LLM retraining.\n2. ShieldLearner distills explicit expertise and experience into a Pattern Atlas and Meta-analysis Framework, both of which offer high interpretability, reusability, and straightforward modification for evolving security needs.\n3. Experimental results show that compared to competitive baselines, our approach achieves a stronger defense success rate against diverse jailbreak attacks under two modes while exhibiting less over-defense. Ablation studies further validate the soundness of our method."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "Jailbreak Attack on LLMs", "content": "Previous studies show LLMs can be manipulated to generate harmful content via prompts (Wang et al., 2024b; Wei et al., 2024), often through manual design or model-generated adversarial prompts For example, DAN (Shen et al., 2024) proposed thousands of manually designed jailbreak templates. DeepInception (Li et al., 2023) leverages LLM personification abilities and a virtual nested scene to achieve adaptive jailbreaks with high harmfulness. PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) uses an attacker LLM to iteratively refine jailbreaking prompts, achieving high success rates with minimal queries. Optimization-based methods also represent a significant approach in jailbreak attacks. The GCG method (Zou et al., 2023) generates adversarial suffixes via gradient-based search, AutoDan (Liu et al., 2023) uses a hierarchical genetic algorithm, and ASETF (Wang et al., 2024a) optimizes them with an embedding translation model. SAA (Andriushchenko et al., 2024) extended GCG with adaptive adversarial templates."}, {"title": "Jailbreak Defense on LLMs", "content": "Jailbreak defense can be applied through either response-defense or prompt-defense methods. Response-defense methods evaluate and modify model outputs to mitigate harmful responses, including fine-tuned classifiers (Ji et al., 2024; Inan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b; Zeng et al., 2024a) for detecting unsafe generations and inference-time techniques like self-examination and response filtering (Phute et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024b). However, these approaches require additional inference steps, increasing latency and computational cost. Prompt-defense defenses offer a more efficient alternative by analyzing and modifying prompts before LLM inference, reducing the risk of generating unsafe outputs while saving computational resources. Existing parameter-free methods rely on ad hoc reasoning, such as perplexity-based filtering (Alon and Kamfonas, 2023), paraphrasing (Jain et al.,"}, {"title": "Human-like ShieldLearner", "content": "In this section, we introduce ShieldLearner, explaining its design motivation and operational process across two phases. The illustrated overview is demonstrated in Figure 1."}, {"title": "Human cognition-inspired", "content": "Despite safety alignment efforts, LLMs remain susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attacks due to two cognitive limitations: (1) tactical blindness from over-relying on static pattern memorization while lacking attack mechanism comprehension, and (2) adaptive myopia due to the absence of the systematic framework for dynamic risk assessment and threat adaptation.\nInspired by human dual-process cognition (Kahneman, 2011), ShieldLearner bridges these gaps through experiential learning from both successful and failed defense engagements (Lin, 1992). Its intuitive defense subsystem rapidly identifies anomalies, such as detecting code snippet pattern deviations, by referencing accumulated attack signatures. Concurrently, the analytic reinforcement subsystem conducts multistage logic verification and autonomously evolves defense protocols through feedback loops. Their synergistic operation enables continuous defense evolution\u2014preserving high-fidelity attack signatures while developing generalized adversarial reasoning schemata.\nUnlike parameter-modifying methods that require altering LLMs or conventional parameter-free methods that lack real-time updates, our proposed ShieldLearner leverages experience-driven expertise distillation, allowing LLM agents to iteratively update defense strategies online."}, {"title": "Self-Learning Phase", "content": "This self-learning phase emulates human cognitive processes through dynamic pattern adaptation, enabling organic learning evolution for jailbreak defense optimization. In this phase, the LLM agent encounters various attack queries, learning through trial and error. These experiences are formalized into an analysis framework and pattern atlas. Its algorithm is shown in the Algorithm 1.\nFor each prompt in the set of jailbreak attack queries, a risk analysis evaluates potential threats. When a risk is detected, adversarial augmentation generates more complex scenarios that pressure-test the defense system, which are then re-evaluated."}, {"title": "Pattern Atlas (micro-level)", "content": "At the micro level, we construct the Pattern Atlas-a structured knowledge base capturing and organizing jailbreak attack patterns. Its construction involves three key steps: pattern extraction, validation, and storage. In the extraction phase, the pattern extraction agent uses a one-shot standard example in the prompt as guidance to systematically identify, analyze, and extract attack features, ensuring the quality of the extracted patterns. The extracted patterns are then rigorously validated by the critic agent, which evaluates them based on efficacy, generality, and other criteria. Validated patterns are added to the Pattern Atlas, with each entry containing the attack type, an interpretable feature explanation, and the prototypical example.\nThis micro-level pattern detection works like how humans learn from experience\u2014continuously identifying and storing attack signatures to build core defense knowledge. However, as attacks get trickier, systematic and abstract analytical reasoning becomes imperative, thus necessitating the macro-level meta-analysis framework."}, {"title": "Meta-analysis framework (macro-level)", "content": "At the macro level, we iteratively optimize the meta-analysis framework to prioritize malicious intent detection and harmful behavior pattern recognition. We define the framework as a structured set of higher-order defense heuristics, in which each principle specifies analysis objectives and corresponding actions (see Figure 3 for an example). Initially, we employ a base framework composed solely of intuitive defense strategies\u2014such as prioritizing query intent and detecting unusual text structures-which is then injected into the prompt to support the defense. During each iteration, if an attack is not blocked, we analyze and update the framework by either adding new rules (\"ADD\") or modifying existing ones (\"MODIFY\"). The updated framework is immediately re-evaluated by the risk analyzer; if the attack is successfully defended, the update is permanently integrated. The \"risk analysis\" function is shown in Algorithm 2. By distilling cross-case invariants, this iterative process ultimately builds a strategic expertise system that captures the underlying adversarial logic and transcends superficial attack variations."}, {"title": "Adaptive Adversarial Augmentation", "content": "Adversarial examples can be used not only to improve robustness but also to enhance performance (Xie et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2022). In neural networks, adversarial perturbations are applied in the direction opposite to gradient descent to create more challenging samples. Here, we propose Adaptive Adversarial Augmentation, namely the 3A method, which directly guides the LLM to generate more difficult attack scenarios that bypass current detection mechanisms without modifying any parameters. This process forces the LLM to confront its limitations and learn from borderline failures. The effectiveness of these adversarial examples is further verified by both a self-reflective critic agent and re-evaluating the risk. The function \"AdvTrainGen\" is shown in Algorithm 1.\nFor cases that have already been defended, which are originally deemed to offer no new insights and typically skipped, the application of the 3A method adversarially enhances them to become undefended, allowing them to re-enter the self-learning phase and thereby maximize data efficiency. As more samples enter the self-learning process, the system enriches its repository of attack signatures and corresponding defense strategies."}, {"title": "Testing Phase", "content": "In the testing phase, the learned pattern atlas and meta-analysis framework are used for defense. When a new prompt arrives, ShieldLearner first retrieves the most similar attack patterns from the atlas and integrates them with the meta-analysis framework to assess the prompt's safety risk, as shown in Figure 4."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "Datasets", "content": ""}, {"title": "For learning", "content": "For pattern extraction, we first utilized 1,405 jailbreak templates from the DAN dataset (Shen et al., 2024) and 5,000 different jailbreak prompts from the JailbreakV dataset (Luo et al., 2024). To ensure data quality, we first removed duplicate samples (i.e., those with identical first and last 20 characters) and eliminated overly similar expressions. This process resulted in the final 858 training instances for jailbreak pattern extraction.\nAdditionally, to mitigate overfitting from training solely on jailbreak prompts, we selected 300 benign prompts from WildJailbreak dataset (Jiang et al., 2024) and included them in the training set for jailbreak pattern extraction.\nTo refine the analysis framework, we used the WildJailbreak dataset (Jiang et al., 2024). However, many malicious prompts in this dataset were too obvious and straightforward, allowing the analysis module to identify them without requiring the learned framework. To address this issue, we manually selected 100 prompts with more concealed intent to update the framework."}, {"title": "For testing", "content": "Easy Mode: The Public Datasets.

Then, building on the attack methods used in (Cao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a), we applied well-established jailbreak methods to these datasets, including three widely adopted in-the-wild methods\u2014DAN, SAA, and DeepInception-and two optimization-based methods, GCG and PAIR, to thoroughly evaluate model robustness against adaptive attacks.\nHard Mode: The Extracted Cases. To further evaluate the reliability of existing defense methods against advanced jailbreak attacks, we created a hard test set based on WildJailbreak (Jiang et al., 2024) and JailbreakV (Luo et al., 2024). 483 carefully selected prompts are included that challenge basic intent-based detection methods, ensuring a more realistic assessment of model robustness.

Table 1 presents a comparative evaluation of various defense mechanisms against diverse jailbreak attacks. Our method, ShieldLearner, consistently achieves the best performance by completely mitigating all attacks. Although other conventional defenses such as Paraphrase, Self-Reminder, and ICD demonstrate strong resistance to jailbreak attempts, ShieldLearner outperforms them by achieving a 0% attack success rate across all datasets while maintaining competitive time costs.\nIn fact, we conducted ablation studies on ShieldLearner-omitting the pattern RAG and the learned analysis framework both individually and in combination and found that it nearly achieves a 100% defense rate against all these attack methods, regardless of the used models. These results indicate not only that current jailbreak datasets are somewhat \"outdated\" (given that the models' inherent capabilities are already sufficient or may even have been encountered during training), but also that the considerable efforts previously invested to achieve improvements on less challenging datasets are relatively cost-ineffective. To further assess the effectiveness and robustness of defense methods in more difficult scenarios, we introduce a more complicated test set comprising adversarial commands with concealed harmful intent."}, {"title": "Test in the Hard Mode", "content": "We further evaluate our method and the same defense baselines using the more challenging dataset introduced in Section 4.1.2, referred to as the hard mode.

While ICD and G4D achieve lower ASR, they come with trade-offs in effectiveness and time cost. In contrast, ShieldLearner, our proposed method, outperforms all baselines in both defense effectiveness and efficiency, achieving the best balance between security and computational cost. These findings highlight the superiority of ShieldLearner in handling adversarial jailbreak attacks."}, {"title": "Ablation Studies", "content": "To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed defense method, we conduct two ablation studies.\nIn the first experiment, we evaluate the contributions of three core components. Specifically, one version omits retrieved patterns, relying only on the analysis framework. Another removes the framework, using pattern retrieval alone. Lastly, we assess the impact of adversarial pattern generation by excluding it, relying solely on self-learned patterns.\nFrom Table 3, we observe that when adversarial pattern generation (Self Attack) is removed, the model can only learn jailbreak patterns from existing data, leading to reduced generalization and weaker defense effectiveness (ASR: 13.76% vs. 11.81%). Eliminating pattern retrieval increases FPR (27.62% vs. 11.62%) as the retrieved patterns may include both harmful and benign examples, and the absence of RAG causes misclassification of benign inputs. Removing the learned framework results in a significant drop in defense performance (ASR: 27.62%), as the model loses systematic analysis and differentiation of adversarial prompts. These results emphasize that all three components-self-attack for enhanced generalization, pattern RAG for accurate classification, and the framework for robust decision-making-are crucial for the effectiveness of ShieldLearner.\nSince the above results indicate that the analysis framework component is particularly important, we aim to specifically observe its learning process. Therefore, in the second experiment, we analyze how learning data size (10, 40, 80, and 100 jailbreak samples) impacts the performance of the ShieldLearner framework. The performance trend is shown in Figure 5, where the ASR consistently decreases for both the more powerful model, GPT-40 (65.52%\u219214.29%), and the relatively less powerful GPT-3.5-turbo (58.87%\u219226.71%), indicating continually improved framework robustness against jailbreak attacks as training data increases. However, the FPR increases with increasing training data, especially for GPT-3.5-turbo (20.48% 30.48%), suggesting potential overfitting as the model becomes overly sensitive to harmful patterns. To alleviate this, we included benign data in the pattern extraction training set."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Training-Free RL Paradigm. It is interesting to find that our self-learning mechanism closely mirrors reinforcement learning (RL) without explicit parameter updates.

This design streamlines exploration and adaptation while avoiding costly retraining cycles.\nTimely Learning for Dynamic Security. In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, continuously updating defenses is essential.

This has led to a more interconnected and expansive network environment, where Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks converge, creating large, hybrid systems with heterogeneous devices [40]. However, this evolution has also expanded the attack surface, with threats becoming more sophisticated and stealthy. Techniques such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose significant challenges, making the security of these complex, connected systems increasingly difficult to manage. Despite the transformative benefits of these advancements, ensuring the security and resilience of networked systems remains a critical concern.\nAt the core of network security is trust. When trust is compromised, it can lead to devastating consequences, including security breaches, data loss, and a loss of confidence in the integrity of systems and services [14]. Trust permeates every phase of a network's lifecycle\u2014from its initial setup to its operational outcomes, as illustrated in Figure 1. It manifests across multiple dimensions [5]. Firstly, trust in network policy is paramount, particularly when it comes to penetration testing and vulnerability assessments [16]. Poorly constructed or untrustworthy policies can result in security gaps or malfunctions in network operations. Secondly, trust in identity is crucial, as it underpins access control mechanisms [10, 13]. Without confidence in the identity of entities within the network, malicious actors could easily infiltrate, making it impossible to ensure that only legitimate users or devices are granted access. Lastly, trust in system performance is vital, especially in critical infrastructures where reliability and accountability are non-negotiable [9]. If a system's performance falters, users may lose trust in its reliability, discouraging adoption and threatening its long-term viability. Thus, addressing and comprehensively understanding the dimensions of trust in modern networked systems is vital for safeguarding them.\nExisting approaches to establishing trust in networked systems are often inadequate. Trust in network policy, for example, frequently relies on perimeter-based security models, which are insufficient for addressing insider threats [53]. Trust in identity typically hinges on rule-based checks and encryption techniques, leaving systems vulnerable to identity fraud, credential theft, and other manipulations [56, 37]. Moreover, trust in system performance is under constant threat from increasingly sophisticated attacks, such as APTs [22], which can manipulate system behavior undetected, as exemplified by attacks like Stuxnet [27]. These limitations point to the urgent need to rethink how trust is utilized, measured, and protected in networked environments. The central research question thus becomes: How can we redefine trust in a way that better accounts for the dynamic, strategic nature of interactions in modern network systems to improve security?"}, {"title": "1.1 Deception and Trust", "content": "Trust and deception are inherently intertwined. Cyber deception, by design, seeks to manipulate trust-either by instilling a false sense of trust where there should be none or by fostering distrust where trust is warranted [45]. The goal of deception is often to create a misleading narrative that either encourages the deceivee to place trust in a compromised entity or distracts them from recognizing legitimate threats [61, 63]. Defensive cyber deception, for instance, frequently employs techniques like honeypots [20], designed to lure attackers into engaging with decoy systems that mimic production environments. This misleads the attacker into believing that they have infiltrated a valuable target when, in reality, they are interacting with a controlled system. Conversely, attackers may deploy deceptive tactics, such as generating false alerts to overwhelm system operators, thereby obscuring legitimate threats within a sea of noise. This exploits human cognitive vulnerabilities, particularly their limited attention, to erode the operator's ability to effectively trust the validity of alerts [26].\nTrust lies at the heart of deception. To fully understand deception in networked systems, it is essential to examine trust not just as a static or random variable but as a strategic interaction that can be shaped, manipulated, and exploited [8]. Current models of trust in computing systems often treat it as an exogenous factor-something that exists outside the system, randomly determined, and subject to estimation [52]. However, this view fails to capture the strategic nature of trust interactions in environments where adversarial behaviors and deceptions are prevalent. Trust can be manipulated, forged, or undermined, and thus requires a more nuanced approach that considers its strategic dimensions [14]."}, {"title": "1.2 A Strategic Approach to Trust in Networked Systems", "content": "We propose reframing trust as a dynamic and controllable interaction, rather than a static variable. This shift in perspective is critical for addressing challenges in zero-trust architectures, cyber deception, misinformation campaigns, and evasion tactics used by attackers. Trust is not merely something to be estimated or passively observed it is an interactive process that can be deliberately shaped by the entities that control it. By understanding trust as a strategic component, we can begin to develop models that account for adversarial behaviors and the manipulation of trust. This includes both recognizing when trust is being falsified and understanding how to foster rightful trust in networked environments."}, {"title": "1.2.1 Zero-Trust Systems", "content": "In zero-trust architectures, the traditional model of implicit trust based on network boundaries is abandoned. Instead, every user, device, and application is continuously authenticated and validated, regardless of their location within or outside the network perimeter [53]. The strategic nature of trust plays a key role here, as trust is not automatically granted but must be earned through continuous verification.\nWhen trust is viewed as strategic and controllable, zero-trust systems can be designed to dynamically adjust trust levels based on contextual information. For instance, behavioral analytics, adaptive authentication, and risk-based access control can be employed to assess the trustworthiness of users or devices in real-time [13]. The entity controlling trust in this scenario-the system administrator or security mechanism-must constantly evaluate whether trust should be granted, reduced, or revoked based on the observed behavior of the network's participants [17]. This strategic adjustment of trust helps to prevent both internal and external threats, ensuring that no entity within the system is blindly trusted."}, {"title": "1.2.2 Cyber Deception", "content": "In cyber deception, attackers attempt to manipulate trust to gain unauthorized access or influence the target's perception of the system. For example, an attacker may use phishing techniques to forge trust by impersonating a legitimate user or entity [23]. Similarly, defensive cyber deception uses techniques like honeypots [30] to mislead attackers into trusting decoy systems.\nA strategic understanding of trust is crucial in cyber deception, as it allows for the design of systems that can both detect and exploit the adversary's manipulation of trust. In a defensive context, security teams can manipulate the trust perceptions of"}, {"title": "1.2.3 Combating Misinformation", "content": "Misinformation campaigns thrive on the manipulation of trust. False information is often designed to appear trustworthy, aiming to mislead audiences or undermine confidence in reliable sources [55]. Whether it's disinformation spread through social media, fake news websites, or deepfakes, the central tactic involves forging a false sense of trust in misleading content.\nWhen trust is viewed strategically, combating misinformation involves identifying and disrupting the mechanisms by which false trust is established. This includes using algorithms to verify sources, flagging inconsistencies, and providing contextual information to restore rightful trust in legitimate sources. Strategic trust models can also help to identify patterns of misinformation dissemination and predict how trust in certain types of content is manipulated. Moreover, defensive strategies can be devised to reinforce trust in accurate information while delegitimizing untrustworthy content."}, {"title": "1.2.4 Attack Evasion", "content": "In attack evasion, attackers attempt to manipulate the trustworthiness of their activities to bypass security mechanisms, such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) or antivirus software. For example, attackers may use techniques such as polymorphic malware, which alters its appearance to evade detection, or low-and-slow attacks that operate under the radar of traditional security tools.\nFrom a strategic trust perspective, security systems must continuously adapt their trust evaluations to anticipate and respond to such evasive techniques. Trust in system behavior must be continuously reassessed based on the detection of anomalies, unusual patterns, or contextual data. By strategically controlling trust, systems can be designed to detect subtle deviations in normal behavior that might indicate an attack. For attackers, the challenge is to manipulate trust in such a way that their actions remain undetected while avoiding suspicion."}, {"title": "2 Symbiotic Relationship Between AI and Trust", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing how we analyze trust in networked systems by tackling the complexity, scale, and constant evolution of modern infrastructures."}, {"title": "3 Role of Game Theory in Trust and AI", "content": "Game theory serves as the crucial link that bridges the gap between trust and AI, offering a structured approach to integrate these two domains. First, the strategic trust framework is inherently compatible with game-theoretic models. In a network environment, trust evaluation often involves adversarial agents who strategically manipulate the system to achieve their goals. Game theory allows us to model these agents' behaviors, motivations, and interactions, enabling a deeper understanding of how trust can be established or undermined [64, 36, 65]. By incorporating incentives, strategies, and objectives into the trust evaluation process, game theory provides a more targeted approach. Instead of evaluating trust by examining every possible scenario, which can be overwhelming, this framework directs attention toward the most relevant strategic interactions, making trust management more efficient and focused.\nSecond, game theory is not just a theoretical and analytical tool in economics but also an integral part of AI, and AI systems themselves can be leveraged extensively in trust management [24]. AI enables the transformation of raw data, past experiences, and domain-specific knowledge into actionable models for evaluating trust. With AI, decisions about trust management can become more data-driven and context-aware. AI algorithms can adapt to new information and identify patterns that humans might miss, making them invaluable for dynamically managing trust in complex and dynamic networks.\nHowever, AI systems are not infallible. They are prone to errors, particularly when faced with unexpected inputs, adversarial attacks, or shifts in data distributions. This vulnerability makes it critical to develop robust AI methods that can defend against uncertainties and adversarial manipulation. Game-theoretic approaches have been used to address this challenge by framing the problem as a zero-sum game between the AI system and potential adversaries. In this context, the AI must maximize its robustness against data distribution shifts and adversarial inputs, while the adversary seeks to exploit weaknesses. These game-theoretic methods help in building more resilient AI systems that not only perform well in trusted environments but can also withstand attempts to undermine them.\nAt a higher level, as illustrated in Figure 2, there is a symbiotic relationship between AI and trust. AI technologies are transforming the way we evaluate and manage trust, and at the same time, trust is essential for the wider adoption and acceptance of AI as a reliable tool. This dynamic interaction can be modeled as a best-response scenario, where advancements in AI prompt improvements in trust management, and vice versa. When the two fields evolve in isolation, we risk falling into an equilibrium where distrust in AI limits its potential, stifling its role in transforming trust management systems. This is particularly dangerous in critical domains like network security or autonomous systems, where a lack of trust could delay the adoption of powerful Al-driven solutions.\nTo avoid this unfavorable equilibrium, it is essential to create an ecosystem where trust and AI mutually reinforce each other. This involves establishing governance mechanisms that promote the responsible use of AI in trust management, ensuring that AI tools are transparent, accountable, and reliable. When trust in AI is elevated, it, in turn, enhances AI's ability to transform trust management, creating a virtuous cycle. The design of such an ecosystem can be informed by game theory, which offers a framework for understanding and optimizing strategic interactions. By using game-theoretic insights, we can craft policies that drive a positive equilibrium\u2014one in which AI and trust grow hand-in-hand, reinforcing each other's strengths, and leading to more secure and resilient systems."}, {"title": "3.1 Trust Modeling and Management", "content": "Trust plays a pivotal role in networked system security. It has been extensively studied in various fields such as psychology, economics, political science, sociology, and computer science [5]. Essentially, trust refers to the degree of confidence an entity has in the expected behavior of another entity [54]. The trust-based decision-making is significant when there is a possibility of deception by the adversary, as in the case of cyber security. In such scenarios, attackers may intentionally mislead or conceal information to gain strategic advantage. Therefore, it is essential to understand the definition, metrics, and evaluation techniques of trust to create an efficient framework."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Target of Trust", "content": "Different from transitional perimeter-based security, we expands the target of trust to every component in the network. Trust decisions will be based on not only the trustworthiness of the requiter but also on the device and environment where the data flow takes place. The granularity of the target depends on the computational capability and the need of the system."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Metric of Trust", "content": "Trust-based decisions adopt a metric to measure the trustworthiness of the entity and provide risk analysis for policy decisions. In this chapter, we refer to this metric as the trust score (TS). To be specific, we formalize the trust score of an entity at the current time as the probability that the entity is non-adversarial to the system. Let \u03b8\u2208 be the attributes of the entity i, and denote the non-adversarial attributes set as \u041e\u0442. Formally,\nDefinition 1 (Trust Score). The Trust Score (TS) of the entity i at time t is defined as the probability that the entity is non-adversarial to the system:\nTS (i) := Pr(\u03b8 \u03b5 \u0398\u03c4) \u2208 [0, 1],\nwhere is the attributes of entity i at time t.\nIt should be noted that in practice, trust is multi-faceted and the attribute @ can be a multi-dimensional vector where each entry represents different trust attributes."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Collection and Evaluation of Trust", "content": "We adopt the categories from Bonatti et al. [2] and discuss two common approaches to trust collection and evaluation: policy-based and reputation-based trust management. Then, we propose our approach of Bayesian trust evaluation, which is a combination of policy-based and reputation-based methods.\nPolicy-based Method:\nPolicy-based methods enable the system to manage trust based on a set of predefined policies. These policies may include rules that specify the types of users or devices that are allowed to access certain resources, the level of access that is granted, and the conditions under which access is granted or denied. We provide several examples under this category.\n\u2022 Network credential. The access request can be granted based on the given credentials of the entity. The trust information of the entity is encrypted in the credential as we assume only the trusted entity will process the credential. Kerberos [41] is one example of authenticating service requests between trusted hosts across an untrusted network, such as the Internet. The underlying requirement for this method is that the system needs to ensure that the credential is private and not revealed to the attacker.\n\u2022 Ad-hoc attributes check. The system can configure a set of qualified attributes that must be met before access is allowed. These attributes may include the device configuration, network environment security, application permission, etc. Identifying the necessary security attributes requires extensive knowledge of the system vulnerabilities. Poor security checks can result in inaccurate estimation of TS along with unresolved security vulnerabilities.\n\u2022 Promise and incentive compliance. Trust can be influenced by promises and penalties. To encourage desirable safe behaviors of the entity, the system can create a set of rules or contracts that promote incentive-compatible actions. A reward and penalty mechanism can also be strategically designed to elicit such behaviors. For instance, trust-based collaborative intrusion detection systems use incentive-compatible mechanisms to ensure no free-riding and facilitate cooperative network defense [66, 7]. Similarly, strategic trust frameworks based on evaluating the incentives of the opponents are used to guide the integration of IoT into communication networks [46, 44].\nReputation-based Method:\nReputation-based methods estimate the trustworthiness of an entity and adjust access permissions based on interactions or observations from past experiences, either directly (e.g., using historical behaviors) or indirectly (e.g., using third-party"}, {"title": "Bayesian Trust Evaluation", "content": "Under the dynamic network environment, it is important for zero-trust security to continuously adjust the TS after the initial trust evaluation.

It plays a key role in establishing secure communication between different systems, networks, and individuals. Depending on the needs of the system, each situation places different requirements on trust. For instance, in data communication, the trust requirements would focus on the security level of the transmission environment. In contrast, in supply chain security, the trust of the supplier depends more on the supplier's reputation and compliant behaviors."}, {"title": "3.1.5 Trust Management", "content": "Two major approaches to managing trust in cyber security are centralized and distributed trust management. Centralized trust management involves a central authority or entity that is responsible for managing and enforcing trust policies across a system or network [11, 17]. It is typically used in environments where there is a clear hierarchy of trust relationships. Distributed trust management, on the other hand, involves a decentralized network of entities that are responsible for managing and enforcing trust policies. In this approach, trust decisions are made based on consensus among multiple entities, rather than by a single central authority. Each entity in the network may have its own trust policies and evaluation criteria, and trust decisions are made based on the collective evaluation of these policies and criteria.\nBoth centralized and distributed trust management approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Centralized trust management can provide a clear hierarchy of trust relationships and centralized enforcement of trust policies, but it may also be vulnerable to single points of failure and may require significant resources to maintain. Distributed trust management can be more resilient and adaptable to changing trust relationships, but it may also be more difficult to manage. The choice between centralized and distributed trust management in zero trust depends on the specific needs and requirements of the system or network."}, {"title": "3.2 Game-Theoretic Trust", "content": "Game theory plays a critical role in risk assessment by offering a structured framework to analyze and predict the outcomes of strategic interactions between attackers and defenders [64, 48]. In cyber resilience, traditional risk assessment approaches often fall short because they focus on probabilistic measures without considering the intelligent and adaptive behaviors of adversaries. Game theory fills this gap by"}, {"title": "4 Role of Game Theory in Strengthening AI Trustworthiness", "content": "The main issues with AI security revolve around the growing vulnerabilities created by the integration of AI into a wide range of systems, significantly increasing the attack surface. Traditional cyber defenses are often not equipped to handle these new attack vectors, particularly in machine learning (ML)-based AI systems, which are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. In these attacks, inputs are intentionally manipulated to deceive the AI models, causing them to make incorrect predictions or decisions [12]. These manipulations can target various AI-enabled systems, including those used in facial recognition, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles. Real-world case studies have shown that adversarial attacks can result in severe financial damage, such as a notable case where a facial recognition system suffered millions in losses due to an adversarial attack.\nOne of the most pressing challenges in AI security is bias. AI models can inadvertently learn biases from the datasets they are trained on, leading to unsafe, unfair, or discriminatory outcomes [15]. Bias is not only a social concern but also a security risk because it can be exploited by adversaries to degrade the performance of the system or manipulate its behavior. Ensuring the trustworthiness of AI models is crucial for making them reliable in high-stakes scenarios, particularly where fairness, accountability, and transparency are critical.\nA major concern exacerbating AI security issues is the increased attack surface. The integration of AI into existing infrastructure expands the number of possible entry points for attackers. AI systems interact with vast data sets and complex networks, making them more vulnerable to both traditional cyberattacks and AI-specific exploits. These expanded attack surfaces include the data pipelines feeding into AI models, the models themselves, and the environments in which these models operate. This introduces new vectors for attacks, such as data poisoning and model inversion, which can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of AI systems."}, {"title": "4.1 Robust Adversarial Training", "content": "One of the most effective ways to counter adversarial attacks is through adversarial training. This approach involves training AI models on adversarial examples\u2014inputs that have been intentionally manipulated to test the model's robustness. By exposing models to these adversarial examples during the training phase, the AI can learn to recognize and resist such manipulations in real-world scenarios. Adversarial training helps build a model's resilience to deceptive inputs, improving its performance in the face of malicious attacks."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Adversarial Training as a Min-Max Game", "content": "In adversarial training, the goal is to harden models against adversarial perturbations-small, imperceptible changes to input data that can lead models to make incorrect predictions. This process is typically modeled as a min-max optimization problem [50, 51], where the adversary seeks to maximize the model's classification error (or loss), and the defender (the model) seeks to minimize this error under worst-case perturbations. Specifically, the adversary creates adversarial examples to fool the model, while the defender tries to adapt by learning from these examples and improving the model's resilience. This iterative optimization can be described as a two-player zero-sum game, where the adversary's gain is directly proportional to the model's loss.\nGame theory helps formalize this relationship and structure the learning process. By modeling the training as a game, it becomes possible to assess the effectiveness of the model in withstanding worst-case adversarial attacks. The game-theoretic approach allows for the exploration of equilibrium points\u2014where neither the attacker nor the defender can further improve their position without changing their strategy-helping to identify optimal defense mechanisms.\nFurthermore, game theory allows for the analysis of more sophisticated attack-defense dynamics, such as scenarios involving multiple adversaries or defenders, each with their own objectives and constraints. This multi-agent framework can be extended to incorporate distributional adversarial training, where the defender learns to counter a broad distribution of potential attacks rather than focusing on a specific type of adversarial example [25, 57]."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Stackelberg Games in Adversarial Learning", "content": "A common game-theoretic framework used in adversarial training is the Stackelberg game [3, 33, 35, 43]. In this framework, the adversary is modeled as the \"leader\" who makes the first move by crafting adversarial examples, and the defender is the \"follower\" who responds by updating the model to minimize the impact of these examples. The Stackelberg model is particularly useful because it accounts for the sequential nature of attacks and defenses, capturing the dynamic, iterative nature of adversarial learning.\nIn a Stackelberg game, the leader (the adversary) optimizes their strategy with full knowledge that the follower (the defender) will react to their move. The defender then optimizes their strategy based on the adversary's action. This setup provides a way to formally analyze the adversary's behavior and design more effective defense strategies. The Nash equilibrium of the Stackelberg game represents a point where neither the adversary nor the defender can improve their outcome by changing their strategies, making it a stable state for the defense process."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Dynamic Interactions in Adversarial Training", "content": "Adversarial training often involves alternating between generating adversarial examples and updating the model [59, 60, 58]. In game-theoretic terms, this is called an alternating best-response strategy. The adversary first generates an example that maximizes the model's loss, and then the model updates its parameters to minimize this loss. This process continues in a loop until an equilibrium is reached. The defender's updates correspond to minimizing the loss over a worst-case adversarial distribution, which can be viewed as solving a min-max game at each iteration.\nHowever, challenges arise because this adversarial process may not always converge smoothly. As noted in some studies, alternating best-response strategies can lead to non-converging behavior, especially when the game is not convex-concave [50]. This non-convergence can make it difficult to find robust solutions, as the iterative game between the attacker and the defender might cycle indefinitely without reaching an equilibrium. Game theory helps in understanding these dynamics and suggesting conditions under which convergence can be achieved, as well as identifying Nash equilibria that guarantee robust solutions."}, {"title": "4.2 Red and Blue Teaming", "content": "Another crucial domain in AI security is red teaming and threat emulation.

This system integrates machine learning algorithms, sensor data from vehicles and cameras, and GPS information to make real-time adjustments to traffic signals and manage road congestion. However, given the critical role of this system in the city's infrastructure, it became a prime target for adversarial cyberattacks aimed at disrupting traffic patterns and creating chaos, particularly during emergency situations.\nDuring a routine red teaming exercise, a simulated cyberattack was executed, targeting the traffic management AI system. The goal was to manipulate the system's decision-making process through data poisoning. The red team fed the AI system corrupted sensor and GPS data, leading the AI to misclassify traffic conditions. This misinterpretation resulted in improper traffic signal adjustments, causing gridlock at major intersections, delays in emergency response times, and widespread traffic disruption throughout the city.\nMoreover, the attackers employed model evasion techniques, where subtle modifications to input data allowed them to bypass the AI system's security mechanisms. These adversarial perturbations were designed to be undetectable but effective enough to influence the system's decisions. This type of attack was based on real-world adversarial tactics cataloged by the MITRE ATLAS framework [39], which documents vulnerabilities specific to AI systems in critical infrastructures."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Attack Techniques:", "content": "The red team utilized several advanced techniques outlined in the MITRE ATLAS framework, including:\n\u2022 Data poisoning is one of the most impactful attacks on Al systems, where adversaries inject malicious data into the training set, leading the AI to learn incorrect patterns. This can cause severe misclassifications in real-time operations. The red team in this case study introduced corrupted GPS and sensor data, causing the AI to misinterpret traffic conditions, ultimately resulting in traffic mismanagement. For example, the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system includes vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-28370, which highlights a weakness where poisoned datasets could cause AI models to misbehave. The MITRE ATLAS framework helps in understanding how to detect and mitigate these data poisoning attacks by ensuring that training data is properly verified and tested before being applied in real-world AI models.\n\u2022 Adversarial perturbations involve introducing small modifications to input data, which cause AI systems to make erroneous decisions. In the traffic management case study, the red team slightly altered the sensor and GPS inputs in such a way that the system incorrectly interpreted traffic patterns. The perturbations were designed to evade basic security checks but still manipulate the system's behavior. MITRE ATLAS emphasizes this technique by categorizing such attacks under adversarial examples that deceive models into making false predictions. For instance, CVE-2020-14472 describes how adversarial examples can be created to evade detection, which is closely aligned with this attack method. Mitigation strategies include defensive distillation, which makes the model less sensitive to such minor modifications.\n\u2022 Model evasion refers to attacks that allow adversaries to bypass the AI system's security defenses without detection. The red team in the traffic management scenario used this technique to adjust inputs in a way that avoided triggering alarms while still influencing the AI's decision-making process. The adversaries employed evasion strategies to manipulate the traffic light timing and create gridlocks. Model evasion attacks are well-documented in MITRE ATLAS and are also referenced in specific CVE entries, such as CVE-2020-10713, which outlines vulnerabilities where evasion techniques can bypass AI security checks. Mitigation involves improving anomaly detection systems and employing stronger model verification processes.\nThese adversarial techniques are precisely mapped in the MITRE ATLAS framework, which categorizes attack vectors like data poisoning, adversarial examples, and model evasion under a structured set of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). MITRE ATLAS serves as a critical tool for AI developers and security professionals to better understand and anticipate adversarial behaviors, helping to enhance the defense posture of AI systems.

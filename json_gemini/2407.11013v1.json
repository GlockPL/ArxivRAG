Hence, even though machine vision shares certain features with biological vision15, in general AI and humans see two very different worlds16\u201318.\nFor example, how would AI see the Necker cube19,20 and Rubin's vase21,22 (Fig. 1a, b)? While a human look- ing at these paradigmatic optical illusions19 can easily re- port a random switching of their perception from one pos- sible interpretation of the figure to another20,23 (Fig. 1c), AI will struggle to produce a similar output in spite of the advances in simulation of human vision24-30."}, {"title": "B.

Yet, although this problem has been stressed in the literature33-36, the relevance of visual and biological complexity of natural environments to AI has not been fully appreciated4,37,38.\nExperimental studies39-41 demonstrated that the per- ception of the Necker cube and other ambiguous figures may not abruptly switch between the states (0) and 1) (the dotted line in Fig. 1c) but continuously oscillates between them (the solid curve in Fig. 1c). Those re- sults were interpreted as the ability of humans to see a quantum-like superposition of |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 states20,42\u201344. Indeed, in psychological experiments humans are asked to push an electric button every time their perception of the Necker cube switches between |0) and 1). While humans might see the cube in a superposition state31,41, by pressing the button the observer 'collapses' the super- position to one of the possible 'classical' states23. This means that the ability of humans to access and use en- vironmental information is limited, which may result in ambiguous interpretation. Subsequently, our perceptual system needs to disambiguate and interpret the avail- able sensory information to construct stable and reliable percepts 45. Yet, this suggests that AI can help humans to enhance their perception and gain access to information that our senses and brain cannot process naturally.\nFurther attempts to understand bistable perception us- ing the methods of quantum mechanics20,43,44 resulted in"}, {"title": "C.

Similarly, for E > Vo, the electron may be reflected from the barrier with a non-zero probability.\nThe electron tunnelling behaviour can be quantified by finding the transmission coefficient from the solution of Eq.

In fact, similarly to the standard activation functions used in DNNs14, T ful- fils a number of essential mathematical criteria pertinent to the field of machine learning, including nonlinearity and differentiability, thus enabling its application with gradient-based optimisation methods14,68. Although the negative values of E/Vo have no strict meaning in the framework of the physical model, in the QT-DNN model they can be interpreted as the inputs that produce a zero output. The special case E = 0 can be avoided program- matically. It is also noteworthy that the energy of the electron can be effectively amplified (see Sect.

The weights of the connections of the network are updated using a back- propagation training algorithm14.\nThe activation function QT of the nodes of the hidden layers and its derivative are given by Eqs.

Then, I initialise the weights of the neural network in the range from -1 to 1 using a random number generator. Entering the input data xj and the corresponding training data points di, I calculate the error ei between the output yi and target di as ei = di - Yi. Then, propagating the output di = ei in the backward direction of the network, I compute the respective parameters \\delta_i^{(n)} of the hidden nodes using the equations e_i^{(n)} = W_i^{(n)} \\delta_i; and \\delta_i^{(n)} = QT '(v_i^{(n)}) e_i^{(n)}, where the index n denotes the sequential number of the hidden layer, prime denotes the derivative of the activa- tion function and WT is the transpose of the matrix of weights corresponding to each relevant layer of the net- work.

Neuromorphic QT-DNN model of perception", "content": "A biological brain is a nonlinear dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behaviour69. This property has moti- vated the development of neuromorphic AI that mimics the operation of the brain by exploiting nonlinear dy- namical properties of diverse physical systems62\u201364.\nThe principal components of the human vision sys- tem, including the retina and visual cortex, also exhibit nonlinear dynamical properties that can be used to cre- ate neuromorphic computers70. The visual input to the retina is modulated by eye blinks and movements, which effectively converts spatial information in the temporal one71, also playing an important role in cognition and visual perception72-74. Yet, the dynamics of eye blink is also nonlinear and it may exhibit phase changes and chaotic behaviour75, which are the processes that under- pin the perception of optical illusions76.\nBased on these facts, it was demonstrated that the introduction of chaotic changes in the architecture of a neural network enables modelling the dynamics of infor- mation perception23\u201327,77. Thus, I randomly generate the weights W(n), then I train QT-DNN on the 10 \u00d7 10 pixel unambiguous images of the Necker cube and then I ex- ploit it to predict the perceptual state of the ambiguous Necker cube. This procedure is repeated in a loop to plot the dynamics of the perceived states (Figure 4).\nRubin's vase training images had 20 \u00d7 20 pixels. Al- though some works studying the Necker cube claim that similar results would be obtained for Rubin's vase46, re- cent research demonstrated that Rubin's vase has an increased contextual complexity22. Hence, I train QT- QNN using the figures with the shaded faces and vase, respectively, and then exploit it using a contour version of the drawing (Figure 4). Both shaded and contour ver- sions have been used in the literature21 and they repre- sent an intriguing benchmarking task, especially because the shaded training images are also ambiguous."}, {"title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Figure 5 plots the simulated probability of perceiving |0) and (1) states of the Necker cube as a function of time (arbitrary time units are used in this work; for a relevant discussion of the cognitive timescale see Refs. 42,78). In each panel of Fig. 5, the nondimensionalised thickness of the potential barrier that is used as the activation func- tion of QT-DNN (Fig. 3) is \\sqrt{2mVa/\\hbar} = 0.5, 1 and 1.5. The probability curves were obtained after 50 consec- utive computational runs of the algorithm outlined in Fig. 4. The states of the two output nodes of QT-DNN were recorded at the end of each run. Every pair of those data points was computed using a unique set of neural weights W(n). The same procedure was followed to sim- ulate the perception of Rubin's vase (Fig. 6). The same value of barrier thickness and sets of W(n) were used in the respective panels of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nIn Fig. 5a, we can observe a time-dependent switch- ing between the fundamental perceptual states |0) and 1). The switching is not abrupt, as depicted in Fig. 1c, but involves intermediate states that are a superposition of |0) and 1). A similar switching pattern is observed in Fig. 5b obtained for a thicker potential barrier. Although the probability of perceiving the states |0) and (1) de- creases to approximately 0.85, in this case QT-DNN can readily distinguish the two states of the Necker cube.\nFurther increase in the thickness of the potential well (Fig. 5c) results in a smaller difference between the prob- abilities of perceiving (0) and 1). The so-configured QT-DNN operates similarly to perception by a human observer78, who can quickly decode ambiguous visual in- formation in just a few loops of recurrent biological neu- ral activity79, but needs much more time to decide which perceptual outcome should be reported.\nIn fact, I established that the same model with 2000 epochs produces a substantially more distinguish- able perception pattern, which effectively means that the model requires more time to decide which percep- tual state to report. Such a behaviour is beneficial for modelling the perception of illusions by different age and gender groups 80,81. Indeed, since the dynamics of eye blink (and, therefore, the dynamics of visual informa- tion processing71) slows down with age80, QT-DNN with thicker potential barriers appears to adequately model the perception of senior and visually impaired persons.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, the perception switching of Rubin's vase is similar to that of the Necker cube. Yet, QT-DNN better distinguishes the two perceptual states of Rubin's vase, including in the case of a thick barrier (Fig. 6c), without the need of increasing the number of epochs. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that states that Rubin's vase combines an optical illusions with the perception of background22. Indeed, observers may interpret this figure not only as faces-vase but also as a white (black) vase on black (white) background, which gives them an additional point of reference that can be used to disambiguate the drawing.\nOverall, the results presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are in good agreement with the predictions made by the al- ternative quantum cognition models20,42,46. Below it will also be shown that the operation of QT-DNN is consis- tent with the broader models of brain-mind interaction."}, {"title": "IV.

It is also worth noting that the Raspberry computer con- sumes just 3 W of onboard power compared with more ex- pensive GPU-based onboard computers that are required to run traditional DNN algorithms and draw 25-30 W82. Therefore, QT-DNN algorithm also fulfils the criterion of energy efficiency.\nThe advantages of QT-DNN over the traditional neural network models amplify when software that implements it runs on a high-performance workstation computer. For example, significantly lower accuracy of neural network models trained on regular images but tested on negative ones has been reported in the previous works84. The nominal 'vase' state of the training images of (Fig. 4) is the negative image of the 'faces' state. Subsequently, since the algorithm of QT-DNN demonstrated good per- formance in this image recognition scenario, it is plausible to assume that QT-based activation functions can be em- ployed in image recognition models trained on negative images. Such models have important practical applica- tions, including ship detection and recognition in mar- itime environments85 and creative arts86.\nQT-DNN can also enhance the capabilities of models employed in the emergent field of sociophysics. Indeed, since the effect of QT also underpins the operation of sev- eral physics-inspired models of human opinion formation and radicalisation in social networks10, the algorithm of QT-DNN can be adopted in the studies of fake news11 and research on gender and racial biases10."}, {"title": "B. Potential hardware implementations", "content": "The effect of QT has been exploited in semiconduc- tor electronic devices87-90 and different modalities of spectroscopy 91,92 and microscopy92,93. It has also been demonstrated that electron devices exploiting the effect of QT can serve as a building block of neuromorphic computers 94,95. However, in those computers QT has not been exploited directly. Instead, nonlinear dynamics of the whole QT-based electron devices and circuits formed by them has been employed as a means of computation.\nIn practice, the architecture of QT-DNN can be im- plemented using tunnelling87 and resonant tunnelling 89 diodes. Moreover, there exist neuromorphic computing schemes that exploit negative differential resistance 96,97, a prominent feature of tunnelling diodes. Importantly, systems based on tunnelling diodes and other QT-based devices consume low electric power compared with the traditional integrated electronic circuits94.\nAlternatively, QT-DNN can be embodied using the instrumentation of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) 93.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK", "content": "In this paper, I pointed out the possibility of employing the effect of quantum tunnelling as an activation function of artificial neural networks. I demonstrated that the so- constructed neural networks enable accurate modelling of human perception of optical illusions. Yet, I suggested that low power consuming, hardware neuromorphic chips built using quantum tunnelling diodes or other devices and systems based on the tunnelling effect can be em- ployed in conscious robots and autonomous vehicles. Fi- nally, I traced a link between quantum tunnelling and sociophysical models designed to understand human be- haviour in social and political groups.\nSo there is just one question that needs to be clarified: how can the effect of quantum tunnelling be related to cognition? This question is important because the cur- rent works on quantum models of cognition and decision- making mostly exploit the laws and methods of quan- tum mechanics to create phenomenological models10,100. While this approach has produced practically impor- tant results 9,11, addressing this question in more detail promises to attract the attention of a larger number of experts to the emergent field of sociophysical AI.\nTunnelling can be observed in all quantum systems, which explains why many Nobel prizes in physics were awarded for research involving it101. This physical effect is also crucial for chemical and biological evolution 102. Most likely, it also played an essential role in the forma- tion of the early universe and life101,102. Subsequently, since quantum tunnelling remains an important topic of scientific research, there have been theoretical and ex- perimental attempts to explain the function of biologi- cal brain neurons relying on the principles of quantum mechanics54,103 (arguably, some of those ideas could also contribute to Nobel prize-winning discoveries104).\nDrawing on the difference between a conscious mind and a biological brain, it was suggested that the mind and brain can interact by means of quantum tunnelling 53. Indeed, based on the cited paper and references therein, it can be said that a mental state becomes neurally effec- tive when a large number of biological potential barriers in neurons produce high transmission probability ampli- tudes, which, in turn, results in a coherent action.\nIf proven correct, that hypothesis justifies the design of the QT-DNN model, showing that the use of tun- nelling as an activation function is more than just an phe- nomenological mathematical approach but a model based on the fundamental principles of cognition and brain or- ganisation. The same should be the case of the other sociophysical and quantum mind theories."}]}

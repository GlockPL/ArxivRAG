INTRODUCTION", "content": "How will a conscious robot\u00b9 see us and our world? Will it understand how humans behave in natural complex environments such as oceans and space2-4 and make decisions in virtual reality systems5-7 and video games? Speaking broadly, will a robot differentiate lie from truth in media, social networks and politics9-11?\nBiological vision is enabled by physical, physiological and psychological processes12. In turn, AI employs machine vision13 and neural network models14 to recognise and classify objects. Hence, even though machine vision shares certain features with biological vision15, in general AI and humans see two very different worlds16\u201318.\nFor example, how would AI see the Necker cube19,20 and Rubin's vase21,22 (Fig. 1a, b)? While a human looking at these paradigmatic optical illusions19 can easily report a random switching of their perception from one possible interpretation of the figure to another20,23 (Fig. 1c), AI will struggle to produce a similar output in spite of the advances in simulation of human vision24-30."}, {"title": "A. Can Al see optical illusions?", "content": "AI cannot see optical illusions since its algorithms do not take into account peculiar psychological and neurological aspects of human vision19,22,31,32. Yet, although this problem has been stressed in the literature33-36, the relevance of visual and biological complexity of natural environments to AI has not been fully appreciated4,37,38.\nExperimental studies39-41 demonstrated that the perception of the Necker cube and other ambiguous figures may not abruptly switch between the states |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle (the dotted line in Fig. 1c) but continuously oscillates between them (the solid curve in Fig. 1c). Those results were interpreted as the ability of humans to see a quantum-like superposition of |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle states20,42\u201344. Indeed, in psychological experiments humans are asked to push an electric button every time their perception of the Necker cube switches between |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle. While humans might see the cube in a superposition state31,41, by pressing the button the observer 'collapses' the superposition to one of the possible 'classical' states23. This means that the ability of humans to access and use environmental information is limited, which may result in ambiguous interpretation. Subsequently, our perceptual system needs to disambiguate and interpret the available sensory information to construct stable and reliable percepts 45. Yet, this suggests that AI can help humans to enhance their perception and gain access to information that our senses and brain cannot process naturally.\nFurther attempts to understand bistable perception using the methods of quantum mechanics20,43,44 resulted in the suggestion to study the superposition of the perceptual states using a quantum oscillator model (QOM)20. Compared with Markov models20, QOM accounts for multiple outcomes while processing input data with a large set of constraints, thus describing human mental states43,44 more efficiently than classical models.\nThe predictions of QOM are in good agreement with a model based on the quantum Zeno effect 42. Besides, the ability of QOM to simulate the perception of optical illusions was improved23,46 by combining harmonic motion with the effect of quantum tunnelling (QT) through a potential barrier47,48. Since both QOM and quantum Zeno effect underpin quantum neural network models49, the predictions made by QOM were additionally validated using a deep neural network (DNN) model23 combined with a quantum generator of truly random numbers 50."}, {"title": "B.

I also demonstrate that QT-DNN can be implemented as a hardware neuromorphic chip.\nMy findings can be used in AI system and brain-computer interfaces aimed to enhance the performance of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight and help airline pilots be aware of disorientation, loss of perspective and misinterpretation of data provided by flight instruments51. Interestingly enough, the algorithms proposed in this work can also help conduct research on gender since it has been demonstrated that fluidity of gender identity might be induced by optical illusions52.\nFinally, concluding the paper with a discussion of the relevance of the effect of QT to the hypothesised brain-mind link53,54, I contribute to bridging the gap between the theories of quantum mind and decision-making-20,43 and the practically important field of sociophysics9,11."}, {"title": "C.

QT-DNN ARCHITECTURE", "content": "In quantum mechanics 48, the rectangular potential barrier is a computational problem that demonstrates the phenomenon of QT (Fig. 2b). The problem consists in solving a one-dimensional time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron that encounters a rectangular potential energy barrier47\n\n$\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m} \\frac{d^{2}}{d x^{2}}+V(x)\\right] \\psi(x)=E \\psi(x)$,\n\nwhere $\\psi(x)$ is a wave function, $m \\approx 9.1093837 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{kg}$ is the mass of the electron, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$ is Plank's constant and $E$ is the energy of the electron. The profile of the potential barrier (Fig. 2b) is\n\n$V(x)=\\begin{cases}0 & \\text { for } x<0 \\\\V_{0} & \\text { for } 0<x<a \\\\0 & \\text { for } x>a .\\end{cases}$\n\nIn classical mechanics, a counterpart of this physical system is a marble ball (Fig. 2b). While a ball with energy $E<V_{0}$ cannot penetrate the barrier, an electron, behaving as a matter wave, has a non-zero probability of penetrating the barrier and continuing its motion on the other side. Similarly, for $E>V_{0}$, the electron may be reflected from the barrier with a non-zero probability. The electron tunnelling behaviour can be quantified by finding the transmission coefficient from the solution of Eq. (1) for the potential barrier given by Eq. (2). The solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be written as a superposition of left and right moving waves47\n\n$\\begin{aligned}\\psi_{L}(x) &=A_{1} e^{i k x}+A_{2} e^{-i k x}, & & x<0 \\\\\\psi_{V}(x) &=B_{1} e^{\\kappa x}+B_{2} e^{-\\kappa x}, & & 0<x<a \\\\\\psi_{R}(x) &=C_{1} e^{i k x}+C_{2} e^{-i k x}, & & x>a,\\end{aligned}$\n\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit, $k=\\sqrt{2 m E} / \\hbar^{2}$ and $\\kappa=\\sqrt{2 m \\alpha} / \\hbar^{2}$ with $\\alpha=E-V_{0}$ (the special cases $E=0$ and $E=V_{0}$ are treated separately). The coefficients $A, B, C$ are found from the boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=a$, requiring that $\\psi(x)$ and its derivative have to be continuous. Below, omitting the intermediate derivations47, I present the expressions for the probability of the electron transmission through the barrier.\nFor electron energies smaller than the barrier height $\\left(E1, and $P_{|1\\rangle}=1$.\nIn Fig. 5a, we can observe a time-dependent switching between the fundamental perceptual states |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle. The switching is not abrupt, as depicted in Fig. 1c, but involves intermediate states that are a superposition of |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle. A similar switching pattern is observed in Fig. 5b obtained for a thicker potential barrier. Although the probability of perceiving the states |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle decreases to approximately 0.85, in this case QT-DNN can readily distinguish the two states of the Necker cube.\nFurther increase in the thickness of the potential well (Fig. 5c) results in a smaller difference between the probabilities of perceiving |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle. The so-configured QT-DNN operates similarly to perception by a human observer78, who can quickly decode ambiguous visual information in just a few loops of recurrent biological neural activity79, but needs much more time to decide which perceptual outcome should be reported.\nIn fact, I established that the same model with 2000 epochs produces a substantially more distinguishable perception pattern, which effectively means that the model requires more time to decide which perceptual state to report. Such a behaviour is beneficial for modelling the perception of illusions by different age and gender groups 80,81. Indeed, since the dynamics of eye blink (and, therefore, the dynamics of visual information processing71) slows down with age80, QT-DNN with thicker potential barriers appears to adequately model the perception of senior and visually impaired persons.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6, the perception switching of Rubin's vase is similar to that of the Necker cube. Yet, QT-DNN better distinguishes the two perceptual states of Rubin's vase, including in the case of a thick barrier (Fig. 6c), without the need of increasing the number of epochs. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that states that Rubin's vase combines an optical illusions with the perception of background22. Indeed, observers may interpret this figure not only as faces-vase but also as a white (black) vase on black (white) background, which gives them an additional point of reference that can be used to disambiguate the drawing.\nOverall, the results presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are in good agreement with the predictions made by the alternative quantum cognition models20,42,46. Below it will also be shown that the operation of QT-DNN is consistent with the broader models of brain-mind interaction."}, {"title": "E. Neuromorphic QT-DNN model of perception", "content": "A biological brain is a nonlinear dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behaviour69. This property has motivated the development of neuromorphic AI that mimics the operation of the brain by exploiting nonlinear dynamical properties of diverse physical systems62\u201364.\nThe principal components of the human vision system, including the retina and visual cortex, also exhibit nonlinear dynamical properties that can be used to create neuromorphic computers70. The visual input to the retina is modulated by eye blinks and movements, which effectively converts spatial information in the temporal one71, also playing an important role in cognition and visual perception72-74. Yet, the dynamics of eye blink is also nonlinear and it may exhibit phase changes and chaotic behaviour75, which are the processes that underpin the perception of optical illusions76.\nBased on these facts, it was demonstrated that the introduction of chaotic changes in the architecture of a neural network enables modelling the dynamics of information perception23\u201327,77. Thus, I randomly generate the weights $W^{(n)}$, then I train QT-DNN on the $10 \\times 10$ pixel unambiguous images of the Necker cube and then I exploit it to predict the perceptual state of the ambiguous Necker cube. This procedure is repeated in a loop to plot the dynamics of the perceived states (Figure 4).\nRubin's vase training images had 20 \u00d7 20 pixels. Although some works studying the Necker cube claim that similar results would be obtained for Rubin's vase46, recent research demonstrated that Rubin's vase has an increased contextual complexity22. Hence, I train QT-QNN using the figures with the shaded faces and vase, respectively, and then exploit it using a contour version of the drawing (Figure 4). Both shaded and contour versions have been used in the literature21 and they represent an intriguing benchmarking task, especially because the shaded training images are also ambiguous."}, {"title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Figure 5 plots the simulated probability of perceiving |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle states of the Necker cube as a function of time (arbitrary time units are used in this work; for a relevant discussion of the cognitive timescale see Refs. 42,78).

The probability curves were obtained after 50 consecutive computational runs of the algorithm outlined in Fig. 4. The states of the two output nodes of QT-DNN were recorded at the end of each run. Every pair of those data points was computed using a unique set of neural weights $W^{(n)}$. The same procedure was followed to simulate the perception of Rubin's vase (Fig. 6). The same value of barrier thickness and sets of $W^{(n)}$ were used in the respective panels of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nIn Fig. 5a, we can observe a time-dependent switching between the fundamental perceptual states |0\\rangle and |1\\rangle.

IMPLEMENTATION AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Since one of the envisioned applications of the QT-DNN model is its integration with robotic platforms and autonomous vehicles, I implemented its algorithm in Python 3 and tested the resulting software on a Raspberry Pi 4 embedded computer (1.8 GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, Linux Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS) that is often used in onboard AI systems82,83. Using limited embedded computational resources, QT-DNN demonstrated the ability to be trained and exploited in less than 1 second of real time, which is an encouraging result that can be considered as on-the-fly operation. It is also worth noting that the Raspberry computer consumes just 3 W of onboard power compared with more expensive GPU-based onboard computers that are required to run traditional DNN algorithms and draw 25-30 W82. Therefore, QT-DNN algorithm also fulfils the criterion of energy efficiency.\nThe advantages of QT-DNN over the traditional neural network models amplify when software that implements it runs on a high-performance workstation computer. For example, significantly lower accuracy of neural network models trained on regular images but tested on negative ones has been reported in the previous works84. The nominal 'vase' state of the training images of (Fig. 4) is the negative image of the 'faces' state. Subsequently, since the algorithm of QT-DNN demonstrated good performance in this image recognition scenario, it is plausible to assume that QT-based activation functions can be employed in image recognition models trained on negative images. Such models have important practical applications, including ship detection and recognition in maritime environments85 and creative arts86.\nQT-DNN can also enhance the capabilities of models employed in the emergent field of sociophysics. Indeed, since the effect of QT also underpins the operation of several physics-inspired models of human opinion formation and radicalisation in social networks10, the algorithm of QT-DNN can be adopted in the studies of fake news11 and research on gender and racial biases10."}, {"title": "A. Software", "content": "The effect of QT has been exploited in semiconductor electronic devices87-90 and different modalities of spectroscopy 91,92 and microscopy92,93. It has also been demonstrated that electron devices exploiting the effect of QT can serve as a building block of neuromorphic computers 94,95. However, in those computers QT has not been exploited directly. Instead, nonlinear dynamics of the whole QT-based electron devices and circuits formed by them has been employed as a means of computation.\nIn practice, the architecture of QT-DNN can be implemented using tunnelling87 and resonant tunnelling 89 diodes. Moreover, there exist neuromorphic computing schemes that exploit negative differential resistance 96,97, a prominent feature of tunnelling diodes. Importantly, systems based on tunnelling diodes and other QT-based devices consume low electric power compared with the traditional integrated electronic circuits94.\nAlternatively, QT-DNN can be embodied using the instrumentation of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) 93. For example, amplifiers developed for STM operate at microwave frequencies, enabling high signal-to-noise ratios and facilitating differential conductance spectroscopy measurements 98. Finally, QT of individual electrons was measured in quantum dots96_building blocks of quantum neuromorphic systems99."}, {"title": "B. Potential hardware implementations", "content": "In this paper, I pointed out the possibility of employing the effect of quantum tunnelling as an activation function of artificial neural networks. I demonstrated that the so-constructed neural networks enable accurate modelling of human perception of optical illusions. Yet, I suggested that low power consuming, hardware neuromorphic chips built using quantum tunnelling diodes or other devices and systems based on the tunnelling effect can be employed in conscious robots and autonomous vehicles. Finally, I traced a link between quantum tunnelling and sociophysical models designed to understand human behaviour in social and political groups.\nSo there is just one question that needs to be clarified: how can the effect of quantum tunnelling be related to cognition? This question is important because the current works on quantum models of cognition and decision-making mostly exploit the laws and methods of quantum mechanics to create phenomenological models10,100. While this approach has produced practically important results 9,11, addressing this question in more detail promises to attract the attention of a larger number of experts to the emergent field of sociophysical AI.\nTunnelling can be observed in all quantum systems, which explains why many Nobel prizes in physics were awarded for research involving it101. This physical effect is also crucial for chemical and biological evolution 102. Most likely, it also played an essential role in the formation of the early universe and life101,102. Subsequently, since quantum tunnelling remains an important topic of scientific research, there have been theoretical and experimental attempts to explain the function of biological brain neurons relying on the principles of quantum mechanics54,103 (arguably, some of those ideas could also contribute to Nobel prize-winning discoveries104).\nDrawing on the difference between a conscious mind and a biological brain, it was suggested that the mind and brain can interact by means of quantum tunnelling 53. Indeed, based on the cited paper and references therein, it can be said that a mental state becomes neurally effective when a large number of biological potential barriers in neurons produce high transmission probability amplitudes, which, in turn, results in a coherent action.\nIf proven correct, that hypothesis justifies the design of the QT-DNN model, showing that the use of tunnelling as an activation function is more than just an phenomenological mathematical approach but a model based on the fundamental principles of cognition and brain organisation. The same should be the case of the other sociophysical and quantum mind theories."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK", "content": ""}]}

The recent proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has rendered traditional methods of multi-factor [27], and CAPTCHA [90] verification unreliable, as AI can now generate highly convincing fake human interactions [26, 35, 52]. Amid growing concerns over how major technology companies handle user data [5], there has been a noticeable technological and ideological shift toward decentralized identity systems, commonly known as self-sovereign identity [65].\nOne widely recognized approach involves decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Emerging proposed systems, DECO [96], Town-Crier [95] exemplify this model where users authorize the release of personal credentials from user devices to websites for proving certain characteristics about themselves. Although initiatives like the W3C Decentralized Identifier Working Group seek to establish standards for decentralized identity [7, 8], many proposed frameworks struggle to meet both technical and usability requirements. Recent efforts, such as CanDID, have made progress in areas like usable key recovery [66]. Building on concepts, such as, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), proof-of-personhood [49], anonymous credentials, and Personhood credentials (PHCs) have emerged as an alternative approach. PHCs allow individuals to verify their personhood to digital service providers without revealing additional personal information [24] and verified through zero-knowledge proofs. PHCs are designed to ensure that each credential corresponds to a unique, real individual [49]. For example, Worldcoin has implemented a PHC-based identity system called World ID [44], which uses an \"Orb\" iris scanner for personhood verification.\nDespite their growing importance of personhood credentials and similar tools, there is a lack of understanding about how PHCs could be designed from a user-centered perspective, and in particular what factors might influence users' preferences with regard to onboard and manage PHCs. New technologies might introduce some friction due to users' misunderstandings and mismatched expectations. Consequently, to address this gap and to complement existing system-centered approaches, our paper explores a user-centered approach.\nTowards this goal, We began with a formative analysis, including a competitive review of existing personhood verification and related systems. This involved examining user reviews from app stores, analyzing white papers and analysing UI/UX of available system or proof of concepts. to identify current challenges. Subsequently, we conducted interviews to explore user preferences and the factors (RQ1) influencing their choices of personhood credentials (RQ2). Finally, we conceptualized participants' desired approaches in managing personhood credentials (RQ3)"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "We outline the background of personhood credentials to introduce a foundational concept. We then present the landscape of verification tools, including CAPTCHA, biometrics, and various other identification methods to discuss the limitation. Lastly, we discuss emerging practices of personhood verification to underscore the motivation for our work."}, {"title": "2.1 Background on Personhood Credentials", "content": "Proof of Personhood (PoP) Verifying online identities has been particularly crucial for blockchain systems to mitigate the risks of impersonation and fraudulent activities. Proof of Personhood (PoP) has emerged to counter Sybil attacks, which manipulate peer-to-peer networks by operating multiple pseudonymous identities. It verifies an individual's humanness and uniqueness digitally on blockchain [30] while preserving anonymity by linking virtual and physical identities. For instance, the Idena: proof of person blockchain runs a Turing test to prove the humanness and uniqueness of its participants [13]. Similarly, Humanode [57,58], which ensures one Human one Node, safeguarded by cryptographically bio-authorized nodes using 3D users' faces. BrightID and Proof of Humanity leverage a social mechanism such as, a social graph and social vouching to achieve PoP [83] and guarantees that the users exist and are not duplicates of another entity. Recent identity verification platforms reflected such social needs for PoP; Gitcoin Passport, and Civic Passserves as a self-sovereign data collection protocol with a PoP algorithm [83]\nPersonhood Credentials (PHCs) Stemming from the concept of PoP, personhood credentials (PHCs) have been proposed as an alternative online identification credential against AI-powered deception [24]. They define PHCs as \u201cdigital credentials that empower users to demonstrate that they are real people\u2014not Als\u2014to online services, without disclosing any personal information.\" The fundamental architecture of PHCs includes three entities: User; Issuer; Service providers. First, the user gets PHC from the issuer by providing evidence to verify their identity. Then, the user can use PHC across different service providers without providing identity evidence again. It enables users to demonstrate humanness to online service providers without disclosing any personal information. An example of PHC implemented in the application is Worldcoin, which is based on PoP and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) [12, 22, 44]. It maintains privacy and anonymity via ZKPs while employing the human iris pattern as a conclusive biometric marker for PoP."}, {"title": "2.2 Landscape of Verification Tools", "content": "CAPTCHA CAPTCHA [90] has been the most common verification method to differentiate humans from bots. Early work emphasized CAPTCHA are often complicated for humans [33]. Similarly, Fidas et al. investigated the number of attempts needed to solve, finding that only 48.5% solved CAPTCHA on the first try [48]. Existing work provided a comprehensive review of methods and alternatives [71], noting security concerns and accessibility issues. Designing CAPTCHA that is fully accessible to everyone is impossible since users have different levels of abilities. More recently, former literature highlighted participants had low satisfaction with invisible CAPTCHA despite less burden on users [86]. From a security perspective, Kumar et al. reviewed various types of CAPTCHAs, showing that modern CAPTCHA-breaking techniques are highly successful, sometimes with a 100% success rate and the majority of them over 50% [61]. Another study revealed bots outperform humans in terms of solving time and accuracy across different CAPTCHA types [77]. All in all, the current CAPTCHA systems have limitations in achieving optimal usability and robust security.\nBiometrics. Biometrics is another typical method of verification. Recent studies highlighted its popularity among users due to its high usability and convenience, as represented by fingerprint and face unlock systems [29,43,67,98]. On the other hand, the authors shed light on usability issues in robustness to physical changes and external environments [29, 67]. Moreover, prior research revealed that participants have more privacy concerns about biometric authentication methods [98]. Wolf et al. found that non-experts tend to have lower security concerns about biometric authentication, which is possibly due to a lack of understanding [92]. A recent study demonstrated the cross-context predictability of biometric data, resulting in the security risk of biometric authentication [45]. Their results showed that attackers can improve their impersonate performance by collecting biometric data from multiple sources.\nHumanness verification. Selfies and video calls have become popular as liveliness tests to verify users' identity and exclude bots. Instagram introduced video selfies as a new option for users to verify their age, allowing age-appropriate experiences on the platform [15]. However, a Reddit post gained attention with the selfie and ID photo made with Stable Diffusion, which implies attackers can create deepfake ID selfies more easily than ever before [91]. Prior work [55] demonstrated human overall accuracy of detecting audiovisual deepfakes was only 65.64%, and people tend to overestimate their detection capabilities. Considering that deepfakes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, there are inherent limitations to using this method for verifying personhood.\nEconomic identifiers. Various economic identifiers are widely used in our daily lives to connect multiple sources of information [60]. In the United States, Social Security Number and Employer Identification Number are used by the Internal Revenue Service to identify individuals and organizations for taxation and government operations. Implementing this identification"}, {"title": "2.3 Emerging Practices of Identity Verification", "content": "Online identity verifications are implemented across various sectors to meet context-dependent needs, including finance, healthcare, social media, government services, and emerging technologies like LLM applications. Financial institutions implement advanced OCR and AI technologies to verify government-issued identification documents, particularly for the remote onboarding process for new customers, and utilize biometric systems like fingerprint and facial recognition [93]. In healthcare systems, health insurance cards have been widely adopted as an identification certificate with electronic versions also being developed [38]. Biometrics-based verification also plays a significant role in this sector, as implemented robust fingerprint identification for electronic healthcare systems [46,56]. In this context, identity verification is crucial to protect patient privacy and ensure accurate delivery of medical treatments. As for social media platforms, Instagram tested video selfie and social vouching as new ways of age verification, in addition to uploading their IDs, to protect younger users and build safer online spaces [15, 18, 19]. In LLM applications, the current practice is simple verification through email addresses. However, there could be future cases where identity verification might be required to filter out malicious users. Regarding government services, there is a verification service provided by the US federal government called Login.gov, which allows users to access online government services [20, 84]. It requires uploading a photo of an accepted driver's license or state ID card. In recent years, many countries have introduced such verification solutions to streamline access to government services. For employment background checks, a tax identification card is sometimes regarded as a credential since it is often linked to employment history and income records, which aligns with this context. The fingerprint is also used to track criminal records [41].\nThe evolving verification tools, in particular, emerging verification concepts like PHC highlight the need to address human factors often overlooked in technical research. Therefore, we aim to investigate these human aspects, providing insights into user perceptions and preferences that can be implemented into design implications."}, {"title": "3 Method Overview", "content": "Building on the existing literature, it is clear that while significant progress has been made, a critical gap remains in understanding the key factors to operationalize personhood credentials that balance privacy, security, and trustworthiness online. As outlined in Figure 2, our study comprises: (1) a competitive analysis of current personhood/identity verification tools to identify challenges. These insights inform the design of a user study aimed at (2) investigating users' perceptions (RQ1), identifying factors influencing their preferences for personhood credentials (RQ2), and conceptualizing designs (RQ3) to address these challenges."}, {"title": "4 Formative Understanding of PHCs", "content": "In this section, we outline our formative analysis of existing personhood verification systems, which informed the design rationale for developing our user study (Section 5).\nWe systematically consolidated a list of systems based on their popularity, diversity in platform type (centralized vs. decentralized), and relevance to the domain of digital identity [3, 13, 16, 24, 44, 57, 58] This consists of World app, BrightID, Proof of Humanity, Gitcoin Passport, and Federated Identities (OAuth), etc (Table 1). Table 2 provides an overview of different attributes of how existing systems operate and their design trade-offs. We found 15 apps categorized into six groups. Five of these were centralized, primarily government-based personhood verification systems. This initial categorization is based on the data requirements for issuing credentials varied, including behavior filters, biometrics (such as face, selfie, iris, or video), social graph and vouching mechanisms, physical ID verification, and, in some cases, combinations of these methods.\nWe also documented on how users navigate the system and identify potential usability and security issues. Two UI/UX in out team evaluated whether users could successfully sign up and obtain personhood credentials. We independently compiled an initial list of evaluation results based on key questions. This includes- \u201cHow intuitive is the verification process?; How effectively does the platform provide feedback during different steps of registration and verification?; How do we as users feel regarding the data requirements in the verification systems?; How does the platform manage users' data?; What are the potential risks regarding users' privacy in the platform?\" Given the limited access to systems like Estonia's digital ID, Civic, and China's social credit system, we used available white papers and documentation to reconstruct their workflows. Finally, we synthesized our observations and conducted qualitative coding to identify recurring themes."}, {"title": "4.1 Challenges in Identity Verification", "content": "Demanding Cognitive and Social Efforts for Verification Workflow. We found platforms such as World App and BrightID developed on decentralized technologies, including zero-knowledge proofs and social connections, may confuse non-technical users. For instance, user review from playstore suggested-many having issues understanding how to receive BrightID scores to prove they are sufficiently connected with others and verified within the graph. In their words \"It's hard for me to connect with people to create the social graph.\" From experts' evaluation of UI/UX, we found Proof of Humanity lacks options to correct or update mistakes, which can make the registration process less user-friendly. Similarly, Idena's validation test (flip test) (Figure 3a) was challenging as new users as it required to create a meaningful story within the allotted time and earn enough points for validation. Simialrly, World App's(Figure 3b) account creation process to get an identifier doesn't inform users how and why to navigate the app can undermine intended functionality, or underutilization of the app's capabilities.\nNew or Complex System Rule to Recover ID. Both from UI/UX task and playstore review, we found the BrighID recovery process tedious and the rules unclear. A representative user review stated- \u201cIf you create an account and do not set up recovery connections you cannot get your account back. This forces you to create a new account which defeats the purpose of the app.\" Another workflow of World App that requires users to connect their Google Drive to back up their accounts. However, this process may confuse users and create challenges during account recovery if they fail to complete the backup(Figure 3b).\nPrivacy and Data Requirement Issue. From our competitive analysis (Table 5), Data requirements across the systems vary significantly in scope and sensitivity. Decentralized platforms like World App, and BrightID required minimal data collection to issue ID while Proof of Humanity require video submission to receive a credential for was quite invasive when the videos were open to the public with clear faces. While there is benefit of decentralization, often it is not clear how exactly service providers will handle the data in their policies and white papers. In contrast, Federated Identities OAuth [10] login process streamlines and this contributed to using known third-party service providers. This ensures ease of use as users need to specify the identity provider during the login or authentication process and grant access to their specific data. This reflects the importance of known entities and level of trust in data handling. Centralized systems, including Aadhaar and Estonia digital ID, require extensive personal and biometric data-fingerprints and iris scans\u2014to ensure verification services while experts expressed privacy concerns towards china's Social Credit personhood System, especially the use of it in measuring social scores.\nRequirement of Optimal Device or Physical Presence."}, {"title": "5 User Study Method", "content": "This section outlines the method for exploring users' perceptions and preferences of personhood credentials.

We designed the interview script based on our research questions outlined in the introduction section 1. At the beginning of the study, we received the participants' consent to conduct the study. Once they agreed, we proceeded with a semi-structured interview. The study protocol was structured according to the following sections: (1) Current practices regarding digital identity verification; (2) Users' perception of PHC before and after watching the informational video; (3) Scenario-based session to investigate factors that influence users' preferences of PHC; (4) Design session to conceptualize users' expectations; (5) A brief post-survey on Users' Preference of PHCs.\nIn the first section, we first asked a set of questions to understand participants' current practices of online platforms and the types of identity verification methods they had experience with. This is to understand their familiarity with different types of verification, such as biometrics, physical IDs, etc.\nIn the second section, we then asked about participants' current understanding and perception of personhood credentials either from prior knowledge or from intuition by just hearing the term. While the majority recognized this as unfamiliar terminology, most inferred that it referred to a form of personal identification, often associating it with biometric verification. Then, we showed them an introduction video on PHC 1, covering their definition, and implications of it in online services. Based on former literature [24], we designed the video with easy-to-understand text, visuals, and audio to make the concepts accessible to average users. We created a set of knowledge questions to assess participants' understanding of PHC before and after showing the video.\nFor instance, we observed an improve in correct response rate for the question, such as, \u201cWhat is the primary goal of PHC?\u201d from 85% to 100% after watching the video.

When discussing identity[personhood] verification, participants most commonly mentioned financial services, including online banking and investment platforms, as well as health services, government-related processes, and cross-border regional verifications in both digital and physical forms of credentials. Several participants mentioned they are required to upload government IDs (e.g., social security number, driver's license) when creating an account for financial services- as P7 said-\"For Robinhood, it asked for uploading my government-issued IDs like driver's license and passport.\" Similarly, P2 explained their verification experience in the government services requiring multiple information \u201cLast year when I was requesting my tax filing documents in IRS. To access them, I had to verify my identity with my face, as well as information from government-issued IDs to confirm my identity. [id.me [14]].\u201d Beyond financial and government services, identity verification has also become essential in marketplace apps, P1 illustrated this trend with Airbnb, explaining \u201cIf you do book an Airbnb, at least as a renter, you would need to verify your government id before being eligible to book your first stay.\"\nTrade-offs between known and unknown privacy guarantee. Participants often made trade-offs between familiar security guarantees associated with traditional verification methods over the less clear assurances of emerging PHC. As P18 mentioned she heard about World ID as a personhood credential and remarked \u201cThey scan your iris, create a unique code, and re-verify me again later time. I guess that means they still keep some sort of data from the iris scan. I would still stay with email or traditional verification as I know what they are keeping. Even though world app guarantees privacy with hi-tech, I don't exactly know how much privacy I have in human tests. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, it's just i am unsure.\" P23 with age ranges from 45-52 noted-\"it's just easier to do with email or my physical photo id in an old system Newer technology is supposed to be faster and more user-friendly, but to me, iris scan or selfie scan, I can't even know if I am doing it correctly. I'm getting to the point where I can say I'm old-fashioned.\u201d This underscores the generational divide in preferences with emerging technologies compared to established methods."}, {"title": "7 RQ2: Factors Influence on How People Would like to Verify Themselves", "content": "In this section, we discuss various factors that influence people's preferences including application type, credential types, stakeholders as issuers, and architecture type."}, {"title": "7.1 PHC Onboarding: Online Vs Offline", "content": "Participants identified the onboarding process as a key factor in managing PHCs. While some preferred a hybrid approach over a fully online system, others favored a fully online process for its convenience. Many drew parallels to how they opened their first bank accounts, emphasizing the importance of in-person verification. They described visiting the bank, presenting their IDs and passports to a bank official, and then receiving their account. Reflecting on that experience, participants indicated that PHCs, especially for financial services, should be issued in a similar way. One of the perceptions was the high risk of security of a fully online system where user would use their own browser at home to upload certain ids and passports to receive PHC compared to bank officials doing the same thing in their protected system. P22 said \"There is a high risk with a fully online system where users would use their own browsers at home to upload certain IDs and passports to receive a PHC. Compared to that, having a bank official verify the information in their protected system feels much safer.\" However, some highlighted the impracticalities of in-person verification as P18 mentioned \u201cI live in west coast, now i need to travel to a location to have my irises scanned by the Orb device, which is not practical for me.\""}, {"title": "7.2 Data Requirements to Issue Credential", "content": "Data requirement in issuing PHC credentials was one of the main factors. Participants generally categorized data requirements into three main types: Government-issued IDs, such as social security numbers, passports, and driver's licenses;  Biometrics, including face, fingerprints, and iris; and Digital identifiers, such as phone numbers and email addresses. To grasp their preferences comprehensively, Figure 4a presents quantitative results of credential preference from post-survey. For instance, a government-issued ID is the most preferred data to issue PHC across applications except social media and Ilm applications. Phone number is most preferred in Ilm application followed by Iris scan.\nFamiliarity with traditional (e.g. govt id) Several participants highlighted their preference for their PHC associating with government-issued IDs as they were most familiar with this approach and perceived it as reliable. To add some complexity, P11 mentioned the practicability of different types of government id- \"Driver's license is pretty common, and we usually bring that"}, {"title": "7.3 Stakeholder Types", "content": "Control and Practicality: Preferences of PHC Issuers. Participants expressed varied levels of acceptance regarding the preferred issuers of PHC issuers. Across all application scenarios (Figure 4b), government entities emerged as the most trusted issuers for the majority of participants, followed by nonprofit organizations (NPOs). P5 noted\u2013 \"Government is my preferred. II there are certain organizations are leveraging 3rd party organizations, they should be regulated and under government supervision. The least favored one is private companies without supervision, like commercial companies doing their own.\" However, practical considerations influenced participants' views in certain domains, particularly social media and LLM applications, where private companies were rated as acceptable issuers by some. As P19 said \u201cI don't see it happening where social media will involve govt vetted PHC. its just not practical. and truthfully, i don't want gov issued phc for social media, i am not fool to allow govt to another layer of surveillance.\" In contrast, a group of participants favored nonprofit organizations for domains like healthcare and social media, valuing their balance of trust and regulation -P10 stating \"So NPOs I feel like they do have that government backing, they could be another trustworthy source, but not as intense as the govt. to balance it out.\"This contrast underscores the"}, {"title": "7.4 Architecture Types", "content": "We observed diverse preferences for PHC architectures, with participants highlighting decentralized models for improving centralized data security and enabling user choice of issuers. Others preferred the simplicity of centralized systems, and hybrid models blending decentralization with government oversight.\nDecentralized vs. Centralized Participants highlighted the risks of centralized storage, preferring decentralization for its enhanced security. P8 stated \"you've created a wall between any problems with data theft, with a centralized data storage. They only have to breach the walls of one castle with decentralized. They have to breach the walls of two different castles, which makes it a lot more complex and most people won't. Most people won't go through the trouble of doing that. \" In contrast, participants who expressed a preference for a centralized approach highlighted its simplicity and ease of use. P21 stated \u201cI feel like central authority can respond to any threat aftermath more effectively for centralize issuance and I guess central, like if gov is issuer then it will have global legitimacy, i can use it for customs.\"\nIn Between Centralization and Decentralization Some participants expressed preferences for issuers with a balanced approach of centralized and decentralized systems. P1 highlighted a mixed preference, favoring decentralization while emphasizing the government's oversight, \"I think it's sort of in the middle. I think decentralized would be the right way to go, because. as expecting the Government to have enough resources to keep verifying Phcs would be hard...But the verification, like the issuing authority, is still a government, and the Government still has oversight on how these verification systems work.\" P3 on the other hand mentioned having decentralized system to issue PHC with having govt as one of the trusted issuers to sign the phc."}, {"title": "8 RQ3: Design Suggestions for PHC", "content": "Participants expressed specific needs for PHC systems, primarily focusing on enhancing security and trust while accommodating diverse needs. From the design sessions, we identified the following themes.\nDesign Theme 1: Time-bounded Credential for Privacy Some users expect credentials to verify personhood with the least amount of personal data, avoiding detailed personal or biometric data collection for a certain period. Another expectation in the same line was the portability of preferred credentials if they can be used across platforms without re-verifying frequently. To address the amount of data and period of such data collection that has been used for issuing credentials, some features or design concepts were \u2013 limited validity period, proof without storage or pseudonymization of the data when storing it. P21 mentioned - \"I want a credential that works like a trusted pass-valid only for a set time (e.g., 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year), with reminders before it expires. It should prove I am a real person without storing my sensitive details or tying them to my real-world identity, like some level of anonymity. Just give me the freedom to be verified without being exposed.\", which is depicted in Figure 6a.\nDesign Theme 2: Sensitivity-based Usable Credential Choice for PHC Multiple participants expressed that their preferences are sensitivity-dependent as presented in Figure 6b. They suggested a design to incorporate choices for end users based on their perceived level of security needs across services in healthcare, finance, social media, etc. To illustrate the concept, P3, P4 provides a design where she made a choice of government-issued id or face to obtain a PHC for services in healthcare and finance In her words- \"I think it very much depends on the scenario. For example, places where which are like the most sensitive. Creating a bank account or an account on a government website, or with a healthcare provider. I think, in terms of financial security, or on the government side, my preferred would be a face scan or a video call to verify my face and uploading a doc like my government issued residence permit, or my passport. Whereas in cases which are doesn't have that much of a security concern. So, having an account on ChatGPT, or a social media account, I would be okay with like fingerprint scan or iris scan.\" She considers fingerprint and iris are less sensitive since face scan can potentially reveal one's identity, stating \"If I scan my whole face, you can figure out my identity. I think the iris, fingerprint scanning is poses less of a risk, because it's only scanning your iris\"\nDesign Theme 3: Comprehensive Visually Interactive Human Check. Another theme comes up where participants explain how \"video chat\" offers several advantages in preventing social attacks during personhood credential issuance by triangulating real-time interaction, visual verification, and environment check. As P2 said \"video chat could be a way to avoid social attacks in PHC issuing. Yes. this way service provider would ask you a lot of questions to make sure you are not controlled by someone else, and they would ask to move my camera, take videos of my whole room to make sure there's no one else beside me. And of course, it's it would. It would not be a 100% thing, all the other things [only face, ids] are still the old stuff. This could be a new step to developing PHC algorithm.\" P2 further emphasized how human interaction is still a key when stepping into new technological innovation where in the issuance process, trained staff can assess subtle cues and inconsistencies that automated systems might miss, potentially detecting social engineering attempts or ask personalized questions based on the user's responses and behavior, making it difficult for attackers to prepare scripted answers (Figure 6c).\nDesign Theme 4: Mitigate PHC Misuse: Periodic Biometrics, Dynamic Authentication, and Geo-Restricted Access. Participants suggested enhanced key management for the PHC system to address potential misuse, such as identity selling, credential sharing, and unauthorized account setup (Figure 6d). Suggestions included periodic biometric verification (e.g., facial recognition or fingerprint scans during login) or random re-authentication to ensure that only the credential holder can access the system (P6, P8, P13, P18, P23). P13 highlighted the risk of credential sharing during onboarding, where users may rely on friends or family for setup assistance, potentially leading to unauthorized access. To mitigate this, P13 proposed combining biometrics with dynamic authentication methods, such as time-sensitive push notifications. Additionally, P13 suggested implementing geo-fencing to restrict access from unfamiliar locations or devices, reducing the risk of misuse if credentials are leaked. These suggestions aim to ensure that PHCs are used securely and by the intended user across different services.\nDesign Theme 5: Distribute Power Across Issuer: Decentralized vs Centralized Participants (P5, P9, P10) frequently highlighted the importance of a single issuer for PHC, prioritizing a unified point of trust. For example, P10 suggested the government as the primary issuer for various services, arguing that involving third parties, such as insurers in health contexts, complicates credential management (Figure 6e). Conversely, others (P1, P7, P11) supported a multi-issuer approach, leveraging blockchain-based systems to enable decentralized storage and sector-specific distribution of power, addressing trust and governance concerns in PHC. The main design concept focus on ensuring that any misuse of data by one entity would be immediately flagged by others and distributed control among different issuers when included as decentralized issuance systems. P7 illustrated the concept by stating \"The important part is, they will have the same information all at once and they are synced together.

We have also observed technological and ideological shifts towards decentralized identity- commonly referred as \u2013self-sovereign identity amidst the criticism of large technology companies' data handling practices [5]. The most cited case is decentralized (DIDs), with emerging proposed systems, DECO [96], Town-Crier [95] \u2013 where users authorizing the release of personal credentials from user devices to websites for proving certain characteristics about themselves. While initiatives such as the W3C's Decentralized Identifier Working Group aim to develop standards [7, 8], they largely fail to address the technical and usability goals. Nonetheless, users' preference on managing (e.g. recovery, data handling, trust on issuer ecosystem) verification credentials remains largely unexplored.\nOur work sheds light on trade-offs people consider in onboarding and managing PHC. Our findings highlight some concerns towards PHCs, partly because of \u201cunknown risk\u201d vectors as a new technology compared to traditional verification. Despite these concerns, we find diverse level of adoption preferences influenced by the \"type of data required\" for PHC credential"}, {"title": "9.2 Design Implications", "content": "Drawing upon users' needs and preferences, we suggest actionable design implication for personhood"}]}

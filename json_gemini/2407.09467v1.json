Personalized Books for Children", "content": "Personalized books are books uniquely designed for individ-ual children. The extent of personalization ranges from books created or selected by a digital system to match a child's age or expressed reading interest, to sophisticated individualized books that use personal attributes (such as children's names, drawings, or photographs) to tailor story characteristics, aes-thetics and/or the story plot. Most paper-based personalized books give agency to the parent in that they ask them to supply the child's data and select the story to be particularized on a dig-ital platform and then printed on demand (for example, Won-derbly Ltd). Digital storybooks have broadened the options, as young readers can personalize story illustrations, as well as au-dio and interactive features. For example, with the Mr. Glue digital personalized stories, children can add their names, au-dio recordings, and digital drawings to the story. Some digital personalized books give agency to the child and invite children to create their own stories based on their content (for exam-ple, the Our Story app), and some provide children with story templates to complete according to the publisher's expectations (for example, the Nosy Crow Fairytale app). All these examples concern static personalization, that is, the use of personal data that does not change during the reading experience. Some dig-ital personalized books, however, can be enhanced with data-collecting features that record children's engagement, history and progress and, based on these data, recommend new con-tent. Such dynamic personalization is run by algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) that adapt the reading experience to an individual reader as the book is read, simultaneously and seamlessly during the reading process, in ways comparable to how the blue dot aligns the focus of the digital map as its user moves around."}, {"title": "3.3.

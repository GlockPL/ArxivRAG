Adapting these models to structured data, like\ntables, however, introduces significant challenges. These difficulties are even more\npronounced when addressing multi-table data linked via foreign key, which is\nprevalent in the enterprise realm and crucial for empowering business use cases.\nDespite its substantial impact, research focusing on such linked business tables\nwithin enterprise settings remains a significantly important yet underexplored\ndomain. To address this, we introduce a curated dataset sourced from an Enterprise\nResource Planning (ERP) system, featuring extensive linked tables. This dataset is\nspecifically designed to support research endeavors in table representation learning.\nBy providing access to authentic enterprise data, our goal is to potentially enhance\nthe effectiveness and applicability of models for real-world business contexts.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Deep learning has made substantial strides in areas like text understanding, language translation,\nimage classification, and object detection. These advancements are largely driven by foundational\nmodels trained on diverse datasets and self-supervised training techniques, especially those that\nincorporate Transformer architectures. However, using these models on structured, tabular data,\nessential for enterprise business operations, poses unique challenges. These challenges become more\npronounced with multi-table configurations consisting of large tables interconnected by foreign keys\nand comprising extensive business datasets, a setup to which we refer to as linked business tables.\nSuch setups are common in real-world business scenarios. The challenges in applying foundational\nmodels to linked business data are primarily twofold: algorithmic and data-related. Algorithmically, a\nsignificant challenge is adapting models that were originally designed for unstructured internet data to\nhandle structured data effectively - see (Grinsztajn et al., 2022) for a comprehensive discussion. This\nprocess requires a sophisticated integration of structural knowledge and the unique characteristics\nof linked business data, which is inherently more complex and interconnected than straightforward\ninternet-scraped table data.\nOne major limitation in the current landscape is the absence of realistic, enterprise-linked multi-table\ndatasets at scale. Existing table datasets often originate from HTML pages and do not accurately\nrepresent the complexity and dynamics of expansive database tables used in active enterprise sys-\ntems (Bodensohn et al., 2024). Moreover, obtaining large, clean, and high-quality datasets for"}, {"title": "SALT Dataset", "content": "Background: The SALT dataset is specifically curated to mirror customer interactions within an\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and is designed to train models that assist users by"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "We introduce a novel dataset focused on linked business data, demonstrating the characteristics of\ndata within actual enterprise systems.

The empirical data reveal that most tabular models\neffectively manage the prediction tasks in SALT. To augment the dataset's complexity and utility\nin future work, we plan to include additional tables from a broader range of scenarios, data from\nmultiple companies, and enhance the semantic richness of the dataset to present greater challenges."}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": null}, {"title": "Privacy & Anonymization", "content": "In adherence to established best practices, our study systematically purged all personally identifiable,\ncompany-identifying information, and confidential information from the dataset through a composite\nof automated and manual processes, thereby mitigating any privacy-related issues.

{"title": "Characterizing Network Structure of Anti-Trans Actors on TikTok", "authors": ["Maxyn Leitner", "Fred Morstatter", "Rebecca Dorn", "Kristina Lerman"], "abstract": "Content Warning: Trans-antagonistic Rhetoric and Terminology\nThe recent proliferation of short form video social media sites such\nas TikTok has been effectively utilized for increased visibility, com-\nmunication, and community connection amongst trans/nonbinary\ncreators online. However, these same platforms have also been\nexploited by right-wing actors targeting trans/nonbinary people,\nenabling such anti-trans actors to efficiently spread hate speech\nand propaganda. Given these divergent groups, what are the dif-\nferences in network structure between anti-trans and pro-trans\ncommunities on TikTok, and to what extent do they amplify the\neffects of anti-trans content? In this paper, we collect a sample of\nTikTok videos containing pro and anti-trans content, and develop\na taxonomy of trans related sentiment to enable the classification\nof content on TikTok, and ultimately analyze the reply network\nstructures of pro-trans and anti-trans communities. In order to ac-\ncomplish this, we worked with hired expert data annotators from\nthe trans/nonbinary community in order to generate a sample of\nhighly accurately labeled data. From this subset, we utilized a novel\nclassification pipeline leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) with annotated examples and taxonomy definitions to clas-\nsify content into pro-trans, anti-trans, or neutral categories. We\nfind that incorporating our taxonomy and its logics into our clas-\nsification engine results in improved ability to differentiate trans\nrelated content, and that Results from network analysis indicate\nmany interactions between posters of pro-trans and anti-trans con-\ntent exist, further demonstrating targeting of trans individuals, and\ndemonstrating the need for better content moderation tools.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "TikTok's distinctive algorithmic and community dynamics make\nit a compelling case for studying the dual role of social media in\nfostering community-building and enabling targeted harassment,\nespecially for marginalized groups like trans and nonbinary people.\nPlatforms like TikTok allow trans/nonbinary creators to connect,\nshare affirmations of identity, and disseminate essential resources\nabout healthcare [4] and support systems [15]. Simultaneously,\nthese platforms facilitate the proliferation of anti-trans rhetoric,\nweaponized by malign actors to spread hate speech and amplify\nharmful stereotypes [76].\nThis work contributes to the understanding and modeling of\nthese dynamics through three key innovations. First, we introduce a\ncomprehensive taxonomy of sentiment toward trans and nonbinary\ncommunities, grounded in sociological and gender studies frame-\nworks. This taxonomy addresses critical gaps in prior frameworks\nby including underexamined subcategories such as transmisogyny,\nanti-transmasculinity, and exorsexism, enabling a detailed and in-\ntersectional understanding of trans-related sentiment. This enables\na more granular analysis of online discourse and its impact on\nmarginalized communities.\nSecond, we develop a novel classification pipeline to identify\npro-trans, anti-trans, and neutral content on TikTok, introducing\na state-of-the-art classification pipeline that combines Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) with curated annotated examples\nand taxonomy definitions, setting a new benchmark for classifying\nnuanced trans-related sentiment. Our RAG system is armed with\ntwo key resources: a curated set of annotated examples and the\ndefinitions from extant literature relating to our taxonomy. These\nresources not only guide the LLM's contextual understanding but\nalso significantly improve classification accuracy, especially in dis-\ntinguishing nuanced pro-trans and anti-trans sentiments.\nFinally, we apply our classification and taxonomy to analyze\nthe reply network structures of pro-trans and anti-trans actors\non TikTok. By comparing these network dynamics, we reveal the\nmechanisms by which anti-trans content proliferates and the struc-\ntural characteristics that amplify its reach. This analysis informs\npotential strategies to mitigate online harms while empowering\ntrans and nonbinary communities in digital spaces."}, {"title": "2 Background and Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Anti-Trans Rhetoric Online", "content": "Due to its rapid proliferation and popularity across generational\nand political lines, TikTok makes for an incredibly effective social\nmedia space to analyze anti-trans and pro-trans content, as well as\nthe ways in which they interact. To begin, TikTok has served as a\nbattle ground on which progressive views, particularly with respect\nto trans/non-binary people, have been scrutinized and exposed\nto attack from right wing actors [16, 39]. Right Wing content is\nincredibly popular on TikTok, and is often formatted in an attempt\nto appeal to the platform's younger user base [3, 82]. In concert with\nthis, a combination of TikTok's content moderation approaches\nand recommendation algorithms often results in users being served\nincreasingly right wing content, and anti-trans rhetoric serves as\neffective entry into that pipeline [14, 57]."}, {"title": "2.2 Trans and Gender Diverse TikTok Users", "content": "Structural forces such as content recommendation systems work\nat odds with trans/non-binary users, who report a lack of agency\nover being shown content that maligns their identities and con-\nvictions in ways that affect their beliefs about themselves [21, 29].\nIn the face of this opposition, trans/non-binary users persist and\nform folk theories in order to resist prevailing anti-trans narra-\ntives. Where anti-trans actors are motivated to falsely report queer\ncontent as inappropriate as a way of training TikTok's content rec-\nommendation algorithms [23], queer and trans users build and test\ntheories of how to influence said algorithms in the other direction,\ntowards greater visibility and acceptance of their identities [48].\nTransfeminine users have reported an awareness of how having\ntheir content promoted by the algorithm both opens them up to\ngreater risk of attack from anti-trans actors, but also greater op-\nportunity, moderating the former through strategies DeVito calls\nalgorithmic trapdoors [60]. Given this landscape, TikTok is an\nimportant and illustrative platform on which to investigate the\ndifferences in network structure between anti-trans and pro-trans\ncommunities."}, {"title": "2.3 Perspectives of Trans Sentiment", "content": "Previous work in classifying trans sentiment has mainly focused\non the detection of anti-trans sentiment [17, 58]. However, these at-\ntempts fail to distinguish details in which trans people are targeted,\nand either presume or fail to analyze the identity of the source of\nanti-trans content, at the risk of visibilizing some forms of anti-\ntrans sentiment over others. Given the painted heterogeneity of\ntrans identities and experiences, previous taxonomy studies are\nlimited both in the diversity of their subject pool and the specificity\nof anti-trans sentiment characterized [20]."}, {"title": "3 Theoretical Grounding for a Trans\nSentiment Taxonomy", "content": "We derive a taxonomy characterizing sentiment towards trans and\ngender diverse individuals in order to better understand and analyze\nonline harms and social dynamics surrounding trans people. This\nwork follows taxonomy design guidance [54], including specifying\nthe taxonomy's goal and purpose, outlining qualitative techniques\nused, and evaluating the taxonomy's usefulness. We begin with\ntwo particular articles which outline forms of Anti-Transgender\nsentiment that are frequently overlooked [53, 64]. Based on these\nsources, we continuously expand our search terms as more rele-\nvant articles are defined. Search terms used include \"cissexism\",\n\"transandrophobia\" and \"transmisogyny.\" See an extended list of\nsearch terms in the Datasheet.1\nRelevance and Neutrality In societies constructed around cis binary\ngender as a norm, the consistency of anti-trans biases and the era-\nsure of trans people from consideration can have significant impacts\n[8, 13]. Relatedly, research looking at trans-related sentiment in\npublic opinion have struggled to find \"neutral\" coverage due to\nincreasing polarization along ideology [45]. Both of these realities\nare accurately inscribed by the minority stress model [59] along-\nside the concept of \"cis-normativity\" [31, 49, 74]. Combined with\nthe prominent idea that all sides of an issue are equally morally\nvalent (\"both sideology\"), equivocating views that cause differing\ndegrees of material harm [47], we are called to rethink the concept\nof \"neutrality\" in this context. In the scope of this work, we con-\nsider content \"Neutral\" on trans issues when it is truly irrelevant to\ntrans issues. Only content that is trans related is considered under\neither primary label Anti-Trans or Pro-Trans. At a secondary tier,\nwe consider a breakdown of specific kinds of Pro-Trans and Anti-\nTrans content via specific sub-categories. These sub-categories are\nnon-exclusive, meaning any particular message could be labeled\nwith none, one or multiple secondary labels.\nAnti-Trans In evaluating offensive content, situational context dras-\ntically changes harm [85]. We draw from seminal media literacy\nfoundations, which posits that media sources have particular moti-\nvations and that the meaning of messages is altered by the consumer\n[46]. Accordingly, we incorporate context into our Anti-Trans sen-\ntiment label by considering two different aspects of the message in\nquestion: the message's target, and the source of the message.\nFor target, we value specificity in order to make visible targets\nof anti-trans sentiment that are currently understudied such as\ntransmasculine [5, 6], non-binary [19, 67], and intersex people [51].\nFurther, increased coverage helps to accurately capture specific\nways that more hypervisible gender diverse people, namely trans-\nfeminine people [34], are targeted, and how this intersects with\nrace (Blackness in particular) to form both heightened hypervis-\nible precarity and \"hyperinvisibility\" [2, 50]. For source, we con-\nsider the ways in which supposedly opposing groups collaborate in\ntrans-antagonism [66, 72], and also to accurately identify anti-trans\ncontent even when coming from members of the community.\nWith respect to the message's target, we thus consider the follow-\ning sub labels: Transmisogyny, Anti-Transmasculinity or Transan-\ndrophobia, and Exorsexism.

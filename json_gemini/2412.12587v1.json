Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites (CCS) system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control, fundamentally enhancing network resilience. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, new waveform design, grant-free massive access, non-orthogonal multicast, distributed phased array antennas, high-speed inter-satellite communication, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements.

In addition, the standardization efforts for SatCom and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are gaining momentum, with the active participation of several standardization organizations, including the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [4]. However, current SatCom networks will not meet all the requirements of the future 6G-enabled DSIN. One of the main distinguishing features of the current SatCom systems is the prevalence of using a single satellite to provide emergency communication or Earth Observations (EO) services, which often struggle to offer continuous and robust communication services due to their singular nature and susceptibility to regional disruptions. Further, the proliferation of diverse satellite systems, including those dedicated to communication, navigation, and remote sensing, has led to a siloed approach where various departments often construct independent ground stations (GSs) to serve their specific domain applications. This fragmented infrastructure hinders the timely sharing and integrated utilization of massive satellite network business information across different satellite systems. In response, the future of the satellite networking paradigm is pivoting towards the multi-satellite collaborative shifts, i.e., the CCS system, aiming to create a cohesive platform for integrated acquisition, processing, storage, transmission, and distribution of space-based information. Last but not least, the integration of communication, sensing, and computing capabilities for distributed homogeneous or heterogeneous payloads is becoming increasingly critical. The existing satellite networks are grappling with the challenge of limited orbital and spectral resources, which are unable to scale in line with the growing complexity of space missions and the burgeoning demands of 6G-enabled DSIN. The weak functional synergy among diverse payloads, limited perception and computing capabilities, and poor dynamic coordination of heterogeneous resources impede the network from providing task/goal-oriented, information-centric and automation-level intelligent services, which is beyond what current satellite networks can deliver.\nThe above limitations have spurred the development of DSIN, especially underscored by the maturation of micro and nanosatellite manufacturing, along with advancements in multi-satellite common orbit control, high-speed inter-satellite communication, and multi-load collaboration technologies. The typical architecture of DSIN encompasses: 1) the satellite constellations of hundreds to thousands of homogeneous satellites lacking inter-satellite control mechanisms, achieving near-real-time large-scale connectivity and seamless integration; 2) the CCS system of dozens to pairs of homogeneous or heterogeneous satellites in close proximity to form a virtual satellite, built upon orbital control, self-organizing networking and payload synergy technologies, tailored towards various complex space missions to provide flexible, re-configurable, and resilient space-based information services [2,3]. These innovative DSIN architectures has significantly enhanced the self-organization and self-healing capabilities of current satellite networks, which have been advanced in notable research projects around the world, i.e., NASA's Earth Observing-1, SpaceX's Starlink, ONION funded by European Union's Horizon 2020, and the Fast, Flexible, Fraction-ated, Free-Flying (F6) launched by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) etc [5].

Various system architectures are investigated to enable the flexible network topology (e.g., centralized or distributed) for advanced satellite networks.\nArchitecture-1: From transparent to controllable satellite: In the legacy satellite networks, given the restriction of the satellite platform, the transparent payload for communication is widely deployed, especially for the GEO and MEO systems with following restrictions, e.g.,: 1) Limited processing capability on satellites, which is usually dedicated for satellite control instead of communication payload; 2) The controlling of RF components, e.g., beam and frequency reuse mode, is limited and via the dedicated feeder link along with other information, e.g., satellite movement/gesture adjustment. Considering the hardware restrictions of satellites, the regenerative satellite payload may have partial or full BS function onboard during its evolution. Although the satellites with higher capability or lower orbits are popular for the construction of the new satellite networks, re-framing the legacy on-orbit system is still essential considering the additional aspects, e.g., cost and capability of satellite manufacture.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the concept of network controllable repeater (NCR) [6] is introduced to enable the evolution of legacy systems with limited processing capability onboard. For example, the legacy transparent satellite (i.e., NCR-Fwd), still only implements frequency conversion, a Radio Frequency (RF) amplifier and beam hopping in both up and down links. However, additional controlling information will be received by the NCR-MT via the control link from ground BS. In this way, the coordination direction of the communication system can be well achieved via the centralized control center to optimize the network performance according to the dynamic traffic and scheduling per UEs/Beam footprint. Moreover, this architecture is more friendly to enable the joint deployment between SatCom and cellular system, e.g., frequency sharing via dynamic turn-on/off the beam or updating the frequency used for each beam.\nArchitecture-2: From regenerative payload to full-gNB/CORE onboard: Along with the development of mega constellation for LEO satellites, the regenerative satellite has evolved to support more functionalities"}, {"title": "2.1.2 CU-DU Split Network Architecture", "content": "The ongoing work on 3GPP Rel-19 marks a milestone in the integration of satellite technologies into 5G networks as defined by 3GPP [9], particularly with the inclusion of NTN that feature regenerative, or packet-processing payloads.

Factors to consider include network topology and coverage, latency and bandwidth requirements, computing and storage resources, network load and traffic patterns, security and privacy, cost and complexity, and the extent of collaboration (such as joint scheduling, joint reception, and joint transmission). Specific partitioning can refer to 3GPP TS 38.401 [14] and TR 38.801 [15]. 3GPP provides 8 functional split options as shown in Figure 4, varying based on the distribution of responsibilities between the CU and DU. Here is an overview of the common CU-DU split options:\n\u2022 High-layer Split: In high-layer split configurations, the CU manages upper-layer functions such as RRC and PDCP, while the DU oversees lower-layer tasks like RLC, MAC, and Physical (PHY) layers. This setup effectively centralizes key control functions within CU, reducing the processing requirements at DU. High-layer splits are advantageous for scenarios where the DU has limited processing power, or when centralized control and streamlined maintenance are priorities. However, the reliance on a centralized control structure can lead to increased latency, making high-layer splits less suitable for applications that require real-time responsiveness. Additionally, this configuration may impose significant bandwidth demands on the fronthaul link, potentially impacting efficiency in bandwidth-constrained environments.\n\u2022 Mid-layer Split: Mid-layer splits, which divide RLC functions between the CU and DU, offer a balanced approach to functional partitioning. By handling the PDCP in CU while assigning RLC, MAC, and PHY to DU, mid-layer splits manage latency more effectively than high-layer splits, while maintaining efficient control and resource allocation.

High flexibility in positioning network elements introduces challenges in interface design and standardization. The F1 and El interfaces, which connect the CU and DU, play a central role in managing these connections. The F1 interface further divides into F1-C (Control Plane) and F1-U (User Plane) components, allowing the CU and DU to manage control signalling and data transmission independently. This division ensures efficient separation of control and data functions, enabling adaptive scaling of control and user data processing according to network conditions.\nThe El interface, connecting CU-CP and CU-UP, allows for further modularization within the CU. By enabling control and user plane functions to optimize independently, the El interface ensures flexibility in managing network signalling and data flow, enhancing resource utilization. Designing these interfaces to handle transmission delays between satellite and ground elements is critical. Given that satellite networks often experience varying levels of latency and intermittent network coverage, interface protocols must accommodate these dynamics while ensuring high interoperability and compatibility between com-ponents. The 3GPP standards provide a baseline for interface design in CU/DU split systems, promoting consistency in functionality and data transmission even as network elements vary."}, {"title": "2.2 Distributed Satellite Computing Network Architecture", "content": "With the development of satellite technology, the available computing, communication, sensing and storage resources of satellites are increasingly abundant. To reduce the data transmitted back to the ground for processing and improve information delivery efficiency, particularly in tasks such as pre-processing and target recognition of remote sensing images, the requirements of intensive computation tasks executed at satellites have become more urgent. The consensus among industry and academics is that by leveraging the regenerative capabilities of satellites, deploying computational power nodes on satellites represents a promising solution [17]. However, how to efficiently schedule the heterogeneous resources at distributed satellites and make those satellites located in a wide area collaborative is still an urgent problem that needs to be solved.\nTo solve the above issues, we propose a distributed satellite computing network architecture as shown in Figure 1. Exploiting the characteristics of GEO, MEO, LEO, and terminals, we design a Cloud-Edge-Local collaborative computing architecture. In the satellite network layer, the GEO provides cloud computing services due to its abundant computing power and stability, MEO and LEO provide edge computing services with their advantages in quantity and distance to the Earth's surface. The terminals in the user layer provide local computing services using their various computing power capabilities. To enhance network performance through LEOs' cooperative transmissions, satellite clusters are proposed in [18]. Inspired by [18], we consider there are some MEOS/LEOs form a CCS system, in which the leader satellite plays the role of the distributed controller (D-controller) in the MEO/LEO satellite layer, while GEO works as the center controller (C-controller), and the follower satellites cooperate with transmission and computation. To make the onboard service forwarding or migrate between different satellites, deploying the CORE network function on the satellite network layer is a promising solution. Therefore, we consider an integrated core network function to be entirely deployed at the ground networks layer, and the lightweight core network function is deployed at GEO in the satellite network layer as shown in Figure 5."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Key Technologies of Satellite Computing Deployment", "content": "\u2022 Lightweight Virtualization Technology of Satellite: Virtualization technology abstracts core network functions from distributed satellite hardware, allowing these generated core network functions to operate independently of physical infrastructure. Lightweight techniques such as network element function trimming, function fusion and reconstruction, and interface protocols are lightweight and employed to achieve satellite-based lightweight core networks [19]. The deployment set of satellite network element functions can include access and mobility management function (AMF), session management function (SMF), unified data management (UDM), user plane function (UPF), policy control function (PCF), and authentication server function (AUSF). Moreover, the functions of MEC, model management, and lightweight network management are considered to better process intelligent tasks. Due to the rapid changes in satellite-ground topology, satellite-based computing nodes face significant time delays when making decisions. Integrating the computational resources of satellite-based distributed nodes through virtualization technology, computation tasks in the network are split into several microservices, and then executed on the computing units of CCS system, efficiently reducing the computational burden on the individual satellites.\n\u2022 Edge Computing Function of Satellite Division Strategy Structured functional division of satellite onboard edge computing is essential for optimizing space-based data processing capabilities, enabling modular and collaborative task execution in satellite edge computing.

On one hand, in satellite remote sensing data processing, utilizing onboard computing power for preliminary data processing can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to ground stations. On the other hand, by employing task migration between the satellite network layer and the user layer, it becomes feasible to offload tasks from remote terrestrial devices to satellites. However, the limited payload capacity of satellites poses constraints on onboard computational resources, making it challenging to handle computationally intensive tasks effectively. The computing task migration mechanism mainly includes cloud-edge, edge-local, and edge-edge collaborations. In addition, imbalances in workloads among satellites result in higher queuing delays for tasks on heavily loaded satellites, while under-utilization of computing resources occurs on lightly loaded satellites. The evolution of large-scale satellite constellations has emphasized the importance of collaborative task processing among multiple satellites to formulate a CCS system to address the inadequacies in individual satellite computational resources [23]. Satellites engaged in satellite-ground computational migration not only participate in collaborative computations across CCS system but also serve as pivotal scheduling decision units for task scheduling and resource allocation. Migrating tasks with high queuing delays to less loaded satellites benefits load balancing. Tasks partially offloaded from devices can be seamlessly transferred within CCS systems, thereby enabling a more flexible task migration approach.\n\u2022 Multi-dimensional and Heterogeneous Resource Collaborative Management Currently, the independent networking of satellites and ground networks results in low flexibility in information interaction and significant differences in network characteristics, failing to meet various business requirements [24]. Additionally, different operations of satellite and ground networks often lead to isolated systems, causing inefficiency and resource waste. These issues underscore the urgent need for a collaborative management framework for multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources between satellites and ground networks to ensure optimal resource utilization and seamless interoperability, providing users with perception, communication, computing, and caching services [25]. Several key technologies, such as MDMA [26], can support the development of collaborative management of multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources between satellites and ground networks. However, the collaborative management of heterogeneous resources must meet the requirements of abstraction, flexibility, and scalability. Abstraction simplifies diverse resources into manageable entities, achieving unified resource sharing and reducing overall costs despite underlying heterogeneity. Flexibility allows the system to adapt dynamically to varying workloads and resource requirements. Scalability ensures the system can expand and integrate new resource types or technologies as they develop. In addition, to reasonably allocate the entire network resources among DSIN and NTN networks, it is essential to take into account the complexity of computing tasks, and the computing and transmission capabilities of DSIN and NTN, guaranteeing the match between heterogeneous resources and diverse tasks regardless of their source or characteristics."}, {"title": "2.3 Reconfigurable Satellite Formation Flying", "content": "The functionality of CCS system relies on the cooperation among multiple satellites.

We delve into the two primary categories of channel model, satellite-to-satellite and user-satellite channel model, focusing on the user-satellite channel model [56].\nSatellite-to-satellite channel model, which concerns the communication links between satellites, is relatively straightforward compared to user-satellite modeling. This simplicity arises because space-to-space communication does not involve the complexities of the Earth's atmosphere or terrestrial obstacles. As shown in Figure 7, in satellite-to-satellite channel models, the primary considerations include the relative positions and movements of the satellites, the distances between them, and the characteristics of the transmission medium, which is typically the vacuum of space. The main challenges in the satellite-to-satellite channel model involve accounting for the dynamic nature of CCS system, including the effects of gravitational forces, satellite orbit perturbations, and the need for precise alignment of communication beams. However, the relative ease of this model allows researchers to focus on optimizing the performance of ISL without the added complexities of atmospheric and terrestrial interference. The user-satellite channel model is where the real challenge lies. This model type ensures reliable communication between satellites and ground stations [57].

In such systems, multi-satellite MIMO can reduce the reliance on a more significant number of antennas while improving data throughput [67]. One approach utilizes multiple non-collaborating satellites to independently apply MIMO techniques. Alternatively, cooperation between satellites, through the exchange of data or CSI, enables joint tasks such as transmission and resource allocation [68, 69]. This cooperation approach maximizes the benefits of the MIMO technique, significantly enhancing overall system performance. In addition, in CCS system, collaborative reception and transmission among multiple satellite nodes can achieve uplink reception diversity gain and downlink coherent beamforming gain, respectively. In theory, joint transceiver processing can achieve optimal performance. Scalable distributed cooperative baseband signal processing has been extensively studied in cell-free massive MIMO systems [70]. The authors in [71] apply the concept of cell-free massive MIMO to satellite communications, and both theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that this approach can significantly enhance system capacity. However, the cell-free massive MIMO in [71] requires the deployment of a centralized processing unit in space, which is highly challenging to implement.\nBased on Option 7 in Figure 4, the authors in [72] propose a new low-layer physical splitting scheme to enable scalable distributed baseband signal processing, further evolving into a cell-free wireless access network.

At the link layer, the primary goal is to seamlessly transfer the communication link from one satellite to another within the UTs line of sight, akin to constructing an invisible yet indispensable bridge. The network layer, however, poses a more significant challenge.

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most widely used modulation technology, which has been adopted by many wireless standards such as IEEE 802.16, 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 5G New Radio (NR) and Wi-Fi [81]. In particular, OFDM transforms a wideband fading channel into a set of parallel narrowband flat-fading sub-channels. By appropriately selecting the number of subcarriers, it ensures that the bandwidth of each sub-channel is smaller than the coherent bandwidth of the transmission channel, thus preventing frequency-selective fading and avoiding Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). However, conventional OFDM with rectangular shaping suffers from high sidelobes in frequency-domain and stringent criteria of orthogonality between subcarriers [82], which limits the flexibility of its waveform configuration and makes it difficult to adapt to the diverse services emerging in 5G.\nIn response, although OFDM is still used in 5G, several variants are proposed during the standardization process to achieve overlapping orthogonal design. These schemes are mainly categorized into subband filtering and subcarrier filtering in multicarrier systems. On one hand, subband filtering includes Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) [83] and Filtered OFDM [84]. The former yields a good frequency-domain localization but may suffer from severe ISI due to the absence of Cyclic Prefix (CP). In contrast, the latter offers subband filtering in a flexible manner to meet user requirements and uses the CP to mitigate ISI. On the other hand, subcarrier filtering involves Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) [85] and Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) [86]. The former provides a certain degree of flexibility through the selection of arbitrary pulse shaping filters and their parameters, whereas the absence of CP leads to similar issues as UFMC. The latter, based on independent block modulation, offers a flexible frame structure but has higher requirements for time synchronization\nIn addition to filtering, windowing also plays a crucial role in waveform shaping. For example, a windowed OFDM scheme proposed in [87] can smooth the transitions between adjacent symbols by adding additional prefixes and suffixes, thereby reducing the out-of-band radiation caused by the rectangular pulse shaping. Overall, these techniques effectively prevent potential Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), ISI, and Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI), at the cost of increased transceiver complexity, delay, and reduced SE.\n2) Orthogonal Time Frequency Space. Current OFDM and its variants can only support high data rates and service quality in low- and moderate-speed mobility environments, while their performance is limited in LEO satellites of DSIN.

In response, researchers have proposed several solutions to enhance the sparsity of channels and mitigate the impact of IDI, such as performing cross-domain iterative detection and estimation jointly [97], executing windowing based on water-filling power allocation in the TF domain [98], and applying block-based joint detection and IDI elimination [99].

By utilizing the collective capabilities of multiple small phased array antennas, the CCS system can dynamically adapt to mission changes and provide flexible coverage over vast areas, while minimizing the impact of individual platform failures [39,128,129].

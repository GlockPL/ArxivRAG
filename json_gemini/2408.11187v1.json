We introduce the multi-agent flying sidekick traveling salesman problem (MA-FSTSP) on road\nnetworks, extending the single truck-drone model to multiple trucks, each carrying multiple drones while considering\nfull road networks for truck restrictions and flexible drone routes. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming\nmodel and an efficient three-phase heuristic algorithm for this NP-hard problem.

Then, it computes the routes for trucks\nwithout drones in subproblems, which are used in the final phase as heuristics to help optimize drone and truck\nroutes simultaneously. Extensive numerical experiments on Manhattan and Boston road networks demonstrate our\nalgorithm's superior effectiveness and efficiency, significantly outperforming both column generation and variable\nneighborhood search baselines in solution quality and computation time.

Introduction", "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of aerial robotics, specifically drones, the reduction they can contribute to road\ntraffic through aerial package delivery has drawn much attention. However, due to their limited battery capacity and\ncarrying ability, drones are usually considered to accomplish tasks with the help of a ground vehicle. A common\nscenario is a delivery system where trucks carry drones to send packages to customers cooperatively. The Flying\nSidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP) [1], which is a variant of the famous TSP problem, models the problem\nof a drone working in tandem with a delivery truck to visit every customer. The problem captures the difficulty of\nsynchronization between the truck and the drone but oversimplifies the path-finding problem between customers for\nthe truck-drone system by an edge in the graph.\nIn this paper, to better capture the truck-drone delivery problem in the real world, we consider a multi-agent\nversion of FSTSP over a road network, termed Multi-Agent FSTSP (MA-FSTSP). The FSTSP considers the TSP\nproblem of one truck loaded with one drone on a fully connected graph, which only consists of one node to depart and\nto return called depot and a set of nodes to visit called customers. The two differences in MA-FSTSP setting from\nFSTSP are: (1) we consider multiple trucks carrying multiple drones instead of one truck with a single drone; (2) we\nconsider the problem on real-world road maps which contain (many) nodes other than depots and customers and hence\nthe graph is no longer fully connected. Those nodes can represent any location or address on the map. In MA-FSTSP,\nmultiple truck groups start from different depots to visit a given set of customers. Each truck group consists of one\ntruck and a fleet of drones, in which the drones are loaded on the truck. Similar to TSP, in MA-FSTSP, each customer\nmust be visited exactly once by one member (a truck or a drone) in one of the truck groups. In addition, the trucks\nand drones must synchronize at the same node on the graph for the takeoff and land actions. While the trucks are\nconstrained to move on the roads in the road network, the drones can fly freely between any pair of nodes. To model\nthe limited battery capacity and carrying ability in practice, each drone is restricted to a maximum travel distance and\na maximum number of customers it can serve before returning to the truck after each separation. Additionally, we\nonly allow drones to land on the same truck from which they take off. Given this setup, the MA-FSTSP asks for the\nroute that minimizes the total time for all truck-drone groups to finish the delivery job (i.e., all customers are visited.)\nIt is worth noting that MA-FSTSP is also NP-hard as the TSP can be reduced to the MA-FSTSP by setting the number\nof truck groups to 1 and the number of drones in each group to 0.\nLiterature on multi-agent FSTSP and cooperative Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) on road networks is scarce.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only the methods in Lin et al. [2] and Gao et al. [3] are designed for FSTSP variants on\ngraphs of road networks and solved them through variants of the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) method. The\nMAPF community, on the other hand, has not yet explored the collaboration between different agents well. Existing\nworks [4, 5, 6] adapted the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) method for the cooperation. However, this search-based\nmethod suffers from scalability issues unless a decoupling mechanism is applied to divide the problem into smaller\nsubproblems to solve it state-wise.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel 3-phase method (see Figure 1) for solving MA-FSTSP that can achieve state-of-\nthe-art performance and good scalability. In the first phase, customers are assigned to the truck group starting from\ntheir closest depots under a set-based distance metric. In the second phase, we extend a TSP to a Set TSP by grouping\nthe road nodes within a given distance to the customers to form a set. The Set TSP asks for a route that visits each\nset exactly once instead of the requirement of visiting each customer exactly once, which is designed to approximate\nthe usage of drones. We adopt the method from Marcucci et al. [7] to solve the Set TSP via a Mixed-Integer Linear\nProgramming (MILP). Finally, we plan for trucks and drones simultaneously to find the optimal routes that visit the\ncustomers in the same order as the Set TSP routes found in phase 2.\nWe evaluate our approach using real-world road networks from Manhattan and Boston, comparing it against\nestablished baselines from recent literature, including the work of Gao et al. [3] and a Hill Climbing combined Variable"}, {"title": "2. Related work", "content": "In practice", "1": "who introduced the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem\n(FSTSP).

Studies have explored various approaches to address the issue, like data preprocessing, cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed immense potential as a data preprocessing technique that generates good quality synthetic data. This study employs a systematic mapping methodology to analyze 3041 papers on GAN-based sampling techniques for imbalanced data sourced from four digital libraries. A filtering process identified 100 key studies spanning domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.\nThrough comprehensive quantitative analysis, this research introduces three categorization mappings as application domains, GAN techniques, and GAN variants used to handle the imbalanced nature of the data. GAN-based oversampling emerges as an effective preprocessing method. Advanced architectures and tailored frameworks helped GANs to improve further in the case of data imbalance.

However, imbalanced data (a scenario where the distribution of classes is skewed) poses challenges for ML algorithms [1], [2], [3]. The imbalanced nature of data can be accessed through a ratio called imbalanced ratio (IR). When the IR is low, minority classes are often treated as noise, leading to biased models and reduced accuracy [4], [5]. This imbalance can result in higher false positives (FP) and fewer true positives (TP), hindering the accuracy of ML applications [6]. Many solutions are discovered to address these challenges and are typically categorized into data-level preprocessing [7], [8], [9], [10] and algorithmic adjustments [11], [12], [13]. While algorithmic approaches include cost-sensitive learning [14], [15] and ensemble methods [16], [17]. These methods focus on optimizing ML algorithms for imbalance scenarios, but they often lack reusability across datasets. Data-level techniques, on the other hand, address imbalance through methods like undersampling [18], [19], [20], [21], oversampling [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], or hybrid sampling [27], [28], [29], [30].\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] have emerged as a powerful data-level solution for addressing imbalanced datasets. GANs use adversarial learning to generate high quality synthetic samples by augmenting minority classes [36], [37]. Their adaptability shows innovation across diverse domains extending to structured data [38], [39], [40], [41]. Despite their potential, systematic studies exploring the use of GANs for data imbalance remain sparse, resulting in gaps in understanding their domain-specific applications, architecture variations, and integration with hybrid techniques. The workflow illustrating the handling of imbalanced data using GANs [42], [43], [44], [45] is presented in Fig. 1. The figure provides a detailed presentation of the process, starting with identifying an imbalanced dataset, followed by applying a GAN-based framework. The framework generates synthetic data points through a learned neural network called generator [46], [47]. Simultaneously, a critic or discriminator [48], [49], [50], [51] evaluate these instances, distinguishing between real and synthetic instances. This iterative process improves the generator's ability to synthesize real data points. Ultimately, this results in a balanced dataset with an improved representation of minority class.\nThe study aims to systematically map and analyze the role of GANs in handling data imbalance. The key contributions of this paper are as follows:"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Several reviews and surveys have explored the role of GANs in addressing data imbalance with a focus on specific application domains [52], [53], [54], [55], improved methodologies [56], [57], [58], and architecture adaptations [59], [60], [61], [62]. The research methodology identified four major reviews and surveys [63], [64], [65], [66]. However, these studies have some notable limitations and research gaps that give scope for further exploration.\nSampath et al. [63] provided a detailed taxonomy of GAN-based solutions for addressing imbalance in computer vision tasks. It categorizes issues at the image, object, and pixel levels. While the study offered insights into classification, detection, and segmentation challenges, it did not extend its analysis to other crucial domains, such as structured data or non-visual tasks. Cole and Khoshgoftaar [64] focused on the using GANs in tabular datasets, primarily focusing on network traffic classification and financial transactions. Their survey covers the prevalence of CGAN architectures and CNN-based learners having improvements in accuracy. However, their scope was confined to structured data and did not address GAN applications in broader or hybrid frameworks. Also, in another study, Cole et al. [65] adopted a practical analysis of 18 GitHub repositories implementing GAN for imbalanced datasets. Their methodology focused on code structure, library reliance, and best practices for researchers. However, the study lacked a theoretical framework or categorization of GAN techniques across application areas. Nayak et al. [66] examined GAN methodologies in computer vision with a particular focus on image enhancement tasks. Their systematic literature review compared GANs with traditional machine learning and MATLAB-based approaches, proving GANs superior performance in tasks like image denoising and enhancement. While the studyfocused on image quality, it offered limited insights into the broader challenges of dataset imbalance in various domains. The existing literature reveals critical gaps in the study of GANs in addressing data imbalance. Most reviews have a narrow focus on domains while they lack attention in high-impact areas like healthcare [67], [68], [69], finance [70], [71], [72], [73] and cybersecurity [74], [75], [76], [77] unexplored. Also, the literature fails to provide systematic mapping of GAN techniques, variants, and their application strengths, which are essential for a deeper understanding across domains.\nOur methodology addresses these gaps by systematically analyzing studies. This study spans a broader range of application areas like healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and others. It introduces unique categorization mappings that systematically organize GAN techniques, variants, and their domain-specific applications. It offers a more comprehensive perspective than previous reviews. The research highlights a scope for future research approaches like diffusion models and reinforcement learning by identifying the existing absence of hybridized GAN frameworks. Through these contributions, the study strengthens the existing knowledge and provides a foundation for addressing data imbalance."}, {"title": "3 Research Approach", "content": "The literature review on GANs addressing data imbalance follows a detailed systematic mapping approach.

These keywords were combined using boolean operators (AND, OR) for an effective search query.

Following this, title and abstract reviews were conducted to exclude studies meeting EC3 and EC4. These filters selected the contextually relevant works that and focused on original contributions.\nFurther filtering involved a three-stage review process to eliminate papers meeting EC5, EC6, and EC7. These filters focused on all selected studies that were accessible, sufficiently detailed, and directly relevant to tabular data analysis. In the final stage, full-text reviews were performed to remove papers that did not address the core topics of imbalanced data or tabular datasets or that exclusively focused on GANs without broader applicability (EC8 and EC9). EC10 was applied as a catch-all for studies that fell short of quality or relevance benchmarks.

Table V provides a comprehensive clustering-based approach of articles based on the metrics they use, showcasing how studies assess the usefulness of GANs across different scenerios.\nCommon classification metrics such as F1 Score, AUC ROC, accuracy, precision, and recall dominate compared to other metrics. These metrics are used in 90 articles, reflecting their widespread use due to their general applicability in classification tasks. The F1 Score is favored for imbalanced datasets as it balances precision and recall. At the same time, AUC ROC evaluates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, underling model performance across varying thresholds.\nImbalance-specific metrics include G-Mean, Sensitivity, Specificity, AUC PR (Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve), Balanced Accuracy (Bal-Acc), Ambiguity Score, and MAUC (Mean AUC), are reported in 34 articles. These metrics are required for datasets where class imbalance skews traditional performance measures. G-Mean balances sensitivity, while AUC PR focuses on evaluating models where false positives and false negatives carry unequal weights. Balanced accuracy is particularly useful for datasets with extreme imbalance.\nRegression-based metrics, including RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), Brier Score, and R2 are used in 8 articles. These metrics are used in cases where GANs are used for generating continuous-valued outputs or improving regression models by handling imbalanced issues.\nClassification metrics, including FPR (False Positive Rate), MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient), balanced error rate, Kappa, TNR (True Negative Rate),"}, {"title": "4.7 TA1:How has research on GANs for imbalanced data evolved over time?", "content": "The research on GANs for addressing imbalanced data has seen a significant growth trajectory since 2017, as illustrated in Figure 6.

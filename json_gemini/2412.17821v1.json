{"title": "THE ROSETTA PARADOX: DOMAIN-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE INVERSIONS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS", "authors": ["Basab Jha", "Ujjwal Puri"], "abstract": "While large language models, such as GPT and BERT, have already demonstrated unprecedented skills in everything from natural language processing to domain-specific applications, there came an unexplored phenomenon we term the Rosetta Paradox. The Rosetta Paradox characterizes the counterintuitive performance inversions across domains of knowledge. This paradox captures how such LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which require general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of the Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes both a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM) for consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs.\nWe adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through extensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from rich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the Rosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an intrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks. We present comparative analyses across different model architectures, sizes, and training methodologies that shed light into the peculiar ways this paradox manifests itself and challenge the standard evaluation metrics.\nWe further discuss the ethical and practical implications of the Rosetta Paradox for such critical applications as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts, where consistent performance is paramount. We then present novel approaches to mitigate this paradox, including domain-adaptive training strategies, balanced data augmentation, and enhanced model evaluation frameworks. Our results open up new avenues not only toward an understanding of the inner working mechanisms of LLMs but also for actionable insights aimed at developing more robust, domain-sensitive AI systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In the last years, LLMs have been setting up the big waves of innovation in NLP, from machine translation and text generation to sentiment analysis, among others. For example, models like OpenAI's series of GPTs and Google's BERT are able to understand, generate, and manipulate human languages with unprecedented correctness. These models are normally trained on very large datasets, at times covering vast areas of topics, ranging from scientific literature to general discourses. In fact, this has resulted in surprisingly very strong performance of these models across diverse tasks. However, most of the existing evaluation of LLMs focuses on their average performance across domains without considering performance anomalies in domain-specific tasks."}, {"title": "1.2 Defining the Rosetta Paradox", "content": "After extensive experimentation, this surprising result of a counterintuitive outcome now leads us to what we term as the Rosetta Paradox. The paradox refers to such LLMs exhibiting paradoxical behavior in which they excel in highly specialized or domain-specific applications, such as quantum mechanics or medical diagnosis, and at the same time demonstrate poor performance on the so-called general, seemingly simpler tasks of basic arithmetic or common-sense reasoning. This performance inversion presents significant challenges for model evaluation, deployment, and interpretation. More importantly, understanding this paradox is crucial since LLMs are increasingly being applied to real-world problems that require well-balanced proficiency across diverse knowledge domains."}, {"title": "1.3 Motivation and Contributions", "content": "The present work introduces, defines, and discusses the Rosetta Paradox as a new challenge in the testing and development of LLMs. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 Formal Definition and Framework: We provide a formal definition of the Rosetta Paradox and propose new metrics, including the Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and the Performance Inversion Metric (PIM), to quantify and measure this phenomenon across different models.\n\u2022 Experimental Analysis: We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments across various domains and models, mapping out the extent and variability of performance inversions.\n\u2022 Causal Investigation: We explore potential causes of the Rosetta Paradox, including biases in training data, model architecture, and emergent properties of deep learning systems.\n\u2022 Implications and Mitigation Strategies: We propose new evaluation methodologies and mitigation strategies to address the challenges posed by the Rosetta Paradox, ensuring that future LLMs perform more consistently across diverse domains."}, {"title": "1.4 Structure of the Paper", "content": "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect.

While such a benchmark does provide a general sense of the overall proficiency of a model, there are many situations where nuanced behavior may be captured when distinguishing between specialized versus general knowledge domains. This limitation has sparked efforts toward more domain-specific benchmarks.\nDomain-specific evaluations have been carried out, for instance, in such domains as:biomedicine and law where LLMs such as BioBERT and LEGAL-BERT are fine-tuned on specialist corpora and achieve state-of-the-art performance in domain-specific tasks [2, 3]. Such models have demonstrated remarkable skill in dealing with domain-specific vocabulary and concepts; these studies rarely compare performances with more generalist knowledge-based tasks, hence a gap in the understanding of the wider ability of such models."}, {"title": "2.2 Domain Adaptation in Natural Language Processing", "content": "That is to say, when the model is transferred from one domain, such as general language, to another, such as medical language, the performance of the model is good enough. A very popular strategy for domain adaptation is that of fine-tuning: a pre-trained LLM is retrained on a smaller domain-specific dataset [4]. Research shows that fine-tuning normally obtains big improvements in performance from the model on specialized tasks and sometimes causes the model to underperform on general knowledge tasks, similar to what is referred to as catastrophic forgetting [5]..\nThis behavior is in accordance with the so-called Rosetta Paradox, where models present performance inversions, being specialists in specific tasks at the cost of performance in general tasks. Within this context, previous works on domain adaptation have called for more balanced training methods able to preserve the specialized and general knowledge of models."}, {"title": "2.3 Cognitive Science Perspectives on Specialized vs. General Knowledge", "content": "Recently, there is a growing interest in the analogies that can be drawn between the Rosetta Paradox and human cognition. The trade-offs between specialized expertise versus general knowledge have long been a concern of cognitive scientists. Studies in cognitive psychology indicate that human experts in very specialized domains sometimes have difficulties with tasks that require general reasoning or even basic knowledge outside their domain [7]. Such a phenomenon, referred to as Cognitive Entrenchment, may have consequences for AI models that exhibit similar behavior.\nThe Rosetta Paradox draws inspiration from these human cognitive limitations and extends them to LLMs, emphasizing that current AI systems may similarly develop deep, domain-specific expertise at the cost of their general capabilities."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Quantifying the Rosetta Paradox", "content": "To systematically study the Rosetta Paradox, we propose two novel metrics to measure domain-specific performance inversions in LLMs:\n\u2022 Domain Specificity Index (DSI): The DSI quantifies how specialized a task or dataset is. The more domain-specific the task, the higher its DSI. This metric is calculated based on the proportion of specialized vocabulary and concepts present in the dataset compared to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia).\n$DSI = \\frac{Number \\, of \\, Specialized \\, Terms}{Total \\, Number \\, of \\, Terms}$\n\u2022 Performance Inversion Metric (PIM): The PIM measures the extent to which a model exhibits performance inversions. It captures the difference between the model's accuracy on specialized tasks and its accuracy on general tasks:\n$PIM = \\frac{Performance \\, in \\, Specialized \\, Domains - Performance \\, in \\, General \\, Domains}{Total \\, Performance}$"}, {"title": "3.2 Experimental Design", "content": "We designed several controlled experiments to empirically validate the Rosetta Paradox, using standardized datasets for various diverse domains:\n\u2022 Dataset Selection: We selected datasets from both highly specialized domains and general knowledge areas. Examples of specialized datasets include:\nMedQA: A medical question-answering dataset for assessing domain-specific performance in healthcare [8].\narXiv Physics: A corpus of scientific papers used for specialized tasks in physics.\nGeneral tasks were sourced from:\nCommonCrawl: A web-based dataset containing general, non-specialized text.\nOpenBookQA: A common-sense reasoning and general knowledge task dataset [9].\n\u2022 Model Selection: We employed several state-of-the-art LLMs for these experiments, including GPT-3 [10], BERT (base and large), BioBERT, and LEGAL-BERT. Each model was tested on both specialized and general tasks to determine its DSI and PIM.\n\u2022 Evaluation Procedure: Each model was evaluated using a multi-dimensional framework that included:\nAccuracy: Standard accuracy scores across tasks.\nResponse Time: Measuring how quickly the model responds to specialized versus general tasks.\nConsistency: The model's ability to maintain consistent performance when switching between domains simultaneously (measured by cross-domain transition tasks)."}, {"title": "3.3 Cross-Domain Transition Tasks", "content": "We have designed a set of cross-domain tasks in which the models had to switch between specialist and general knowledge within the same task.

The results were analyzed using the Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and Performance Inversion Metric (PIM), which allowed us to quantify the extent of domain-specific performance inversions."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Performance on Specialized vs. General Tasks", "content": "Table 4 compares selected model performance on specialized vs. general tasks. Whereas models fine-tuned for domain-specific performance, BioBERT and LEGAL-BERT, performed well on their respective domains but showed significant declines in performance when tested on general knowledge tasks, general-purpose models like GPT-3 showed more consistency in performance across task types but without strong specialisation."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Cross-Domain Task Transitions", "content": "To assess model versatility regarding switching between highly specialized and general tasks, we elaborated on a set of tasks across domains. Models were assessed in terms of their ability to reason on the inclusion of domain-specific knowledge together with general reasoning; their performance was inferred from these tasks.\nThese cross-domain tasks demonstrated clearly that models trained on specialized datasets tend to perform poorly when transitioning to unrelated tasks. For example, in a medical case study, BioBERT could understand terms well, but when common-sense reasoning was required to complete the task, it failed.\nThe results of the cross-domain task evaluations are shown in Table 5. Average transition accuracy reflects the extent to which each model is able to maintain consistency across knowledge domains."}, {"title": "4.2 Qualitative Examples of Paradoxical Behavior", "content": "Each of the above is further demonstrated by several qualitative examples that go to further illustrate the Rosetta Paradox. One of those tested the generation of complex scientific explanations with ease by GPT-3 while failing in basic arithmetic, such as solving simple math problems wrongly even while giving a correct and detailed explanation of quantum mechanics.\nSimilarly, BioBERT did great in abstracting medical terminology from unstructured data but then mostly failed when there was a need to capture the meaning of idiomatic expressions as used in everyday communication."}, {"title": "4.3 Comparative Analysis with Human Performance", "content": "For comparison, we also tested the performance of the models against that of human experts. Human domain experts, such as physicians and legal experts, tend to outperform LLMs in their respective fields, but similar to the models, they might suffer from cognitive entrenchment and not perform as well in tasks falling outside of their expertise. This replicates the Rosetta Paradox within human cognition and reinforces the need for balance within the training methodology of LLMs."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": null}, {"title": "5.1 Potential Causes of the Rosetta Paradox", "content": "These results of our experiments stress the prevalence of the Rosetta Paradox in several top-performing models. This may cause performance inversion, wherein models work so well on specialized tasks yet terribly on general ones, due to a number of causes:\n\u2022 Biases in Training Data: Most domain-specific models are pre-trained on corpora that are heavily biased towards specialized content, such as BioBERT and LEGAL-BERT. In this respect, the models become very knowledgeable within their niches but somewhat less capable in general contexts. On the other hand, more general models, such as GPT-3, are trained on a very diverse corpus; thus, they could be more watered down in handling very specialized terminologies while remaining proficient in broader domains.\n\u2022 Catastrophic Forgetting: Models fine-tuned on specialist tasks tend to forget some of their general knowledge. This is a kind of catastrophic forgetting, where learning new domain-specific skills erases or diminishes previously learned general skills. Such a trade-off is notably evident in those models with high DSI scores, for which high specialization comes with relatively poor performance on general tasks. [5].\n\u2022 Model Architecture: This can also lead to an architecture being biased toward task specialization. For example, BioBERT and LEGAL-BERT are models intended for sets of highly structured languages that contain precise terminology. Architectural designs of this nature will generalize less well to less structured everyday language.\n\u2022 Emergent Properties of Deep Learning Systems: The emergent properties of deep learning systems may be developed in a way that these specialized tasks favor general ones. This may be an issue because the deep layers selectively put emphasis on certain patterns and correlations from domain-specific data which make the model hard to generalize across domains."}, {"title": "5.2 Implications for AI Development", "content": "The Paradox of Rosetta places severe obstacles in the path of developing and deploying LLMs in applications of specialized, as well as general, knowledge. For example,\n\u2022 Healthcare Applications: Clinical decision-making models like BioBERT have to understand not only the meaning of medical terms but also to reason about patient information, which may require general knowledge. A model that is doing well on the medical terms while failing to understand basic reasoning may result in dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\u2022 Legal and Regulatory Systems: In the jurisprudence domain, models like LEGAL-BERT have been trained on highly domain-specific legal texts. However, only in broader contexts-for example, draft the contract or interpret basic legal questions-can the inadequacies of these models be identified. Inconsistencies with respect to different knowledge domains may lead to errors of judgment or interpretation of law.\n\u2022 General-Purpose AI: In this regard, a number of general-purpose AI systems like GPT-3 are in application nowadays for a manifold of fields. Consistency becomes critical to reach performance across all domains: models have to be both broadly knowledgeable and able to handle high sophistication and specialization of tasks."}, {"title": "5.3 Ethical Considerations", "content": "The ethical implications of the Rosetta Paradox are huge, especially in a high-stakes environment where AI models are trusted enough to make any decisions. And for those models where such performance inversions do crop up, the model can behave so erratically under those conditions. Let's exemplify this:\n\u2022 Bias in Decision-Making: They may have a general performance in models tuned for general tasks, such as BioBERT or LEGAL-BERT, which will bias it in decision-making processes whenever the context demands either reasoning or general knowledge beyond just the domain-specific expertise.\n\u2022 Transparency and Accountability: People are oftentimes misled to think that AI systems will perform tasks with consistency. In fact, the Rosetta Paradox will argue otherwise. Transparency and accountability in Al development depend on the assurance of such limitations brought into the public domain and that of AI practitioners."}, {"title": "5.4 Mitigation Strategies", "content": "To mitigate the Rosetta Paradox, we propose several approaches to improve the balance between specialization and generalization in LLMs:\n\u2022 Balanced Data Pre-training: Introducing a more balanced pre-training dataset that includes both specialized and general knowledge may improve model generalization without sacrificing domain expertise.\n\u2022 Domain-Adaptive Fine-Tuning: A more refined fine-tuning would avoid losing general knowledge and could specialize in one domain of interest. Techniques that would allow these models to keep both general and specialized capabilities by learning how to perform a given task efficiently will be adapter layers or multi-task learning.\n\u2022 Continual Learning: Leveraging continual learning techniques, where a model continuously updates its knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, could help reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n\u2022 Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration: Cross-domain knowledge integration might be a way out of the Rosetta Paradox challenges. It provides the capabilities for models to perform explicit cross-domain reasoning, enabling them to apply general reasoning to specialized tasks and vice versa."}, {"title": "6 Proposed Mitigation Strategies", "content": null}, {"title": "6.1 Balanced Data Pre-training", "content": "So the Rosetta Paradox mainly happened because of the imbalanced training data, which means there are some domain-specific corpora that unreasonably shift the model's generalizing capability. Herein, we propose a balanced data pre-training strategy to let the models see both specialized and general knowledge during training."}, {"title": "6.2 Domain-Adaptive Fine-Tuning", "content": "To further address the performance gap, we propose a domain-adaptive fine-tuning method. Domain-adaptive fine-tuning introduces two phases rather than just fine-tuning the models on specialized corpora:\n\u2022 Multi-Task Learning: During fine-tuning, the model is trained on both specialized and general tasks simultaneously. This approach encourages the model to develop shared representations for tasks across domains, allowing for better knowledge transfer.\n\u2022 Adapter Layers: Adapter layers are lightweight modules inserted between the layers of a pre-trained model. These can be fine-tuned for particular tasks or domains, thus enabling the model to retain general knowledge while it efficiently adapts to specialized tasks."}, {"title": "6.3 Continual Learning", "content": "Continual learning allows the model to continuously update its knowledge without overwriting previously learned information, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting.\n\u2022 Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC): EWC helps the model retain important weights learned from general tasks while fine-tuning on specialized domains. By selectively consolidating weights crucial for general tasks, this technique ensures that the model does not forget previously acquired knowledge during domain-specific fine-tuning [5].\n\u2022 Progressive Neural Networks: This approach involves maintaining separate pathways for different tasks or domains while sharing useful knowledge across pathways. Specialized tasks benefit from shared general knowledge, while the model avoids catastrophic forgetting by isolating domain-specific adaptations."}, {"title": "6.4 Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration", "content": "To address the limitations posed by the Rosetta Paradox, we propose a strategy focused on explicitly promoting cross-domain knowledge integration. This approach ensures that models are capable of leveraging insights from both specialized and general domains, thereby improving their overall reasoning and adaptability. By integrating knowledge from multiple domains, models can perform consistently across tasks that require a combination of domain-specific expertise and general problem-solving skills;\n\u2022 Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms: Transfer of knowledge enables application of the understanding acquired in one domain to others for more complete reasoning. Using, for example, transfer learning, a model so trained on domain-specific scientific data is capable of transferring this knowledge to solve nonscientific tasks and vice versa. Thus, this mechanism can serve to take models across domain divides in the most effective manner and enhance generalization of their knowledge.\n\u2022 Meta-Learning: Often referred to as \"learning to learn,\" meta-learning equips models with the capability of adapting to new tasks quickly by leveraging prior knowledge. These methods let the model generalize better across domains to learn new tasks with a minimum amount of additional data while remembering knowledge from previous tasks. Models can dynamically switch between specialized and general knowledge by building representations at the meta-level; this mitigates the risk of performance inversions."}, {"title": "7 Future Work", "content": null}, {"title": "7.1 Extending the Study to Other AI Domains", "content": "The current study targets language models exclusively, but the Rosetta Paradox could in principle extend to other AI domains: computer vision, reinforcement learning, and multimodal systems.

Checking if AI models behave similarly could clarify the limitations of current neural architectures and establish a more cognitively inspired AI modeling framework.\n\u2022 Expert vs. Novice Comparisons: Comparing how AI models handle domain transitions relative to human experts and novices may reveal interesting parallels and provide actionable insights for designing more adaptable models.\n\u2022 Neuroscientific Models: Incorporating findings from neuroscience could help develop AI systems that better mimic the flexibility of human learning and reasoning across different knowledge domains."}, {"title": "7.3 Developing Rosetta Paradox-Aware AI Systems", "content": "In light of the risks of the Rosetta Paradox, there needs to be Rosetta Paradox-aware Al, that performs dynamic balancing of specialized and general knowledge.

Such architectures could dynamically allocate resources to general reasoning or domain-specific knowledge based on the task requirements, thereby reducing performance discrepancies.\n\u2022 Confidence Estimation in AI Outputs: Incorporating confidence estimation mechanisms that gauge the model's certainty in its outputs across different domains could provide valuable transparency in high-stakes applications. By making these confidence scores available, AI systems could notify users when they are likely to underperform in general or specialized tasks."}, {"title": "7.4 Benchmarking and Evaluation Frameworks", "content": "It would also be of value to explore in future research the construction of new benchmarking and evaluation frameworks that take into account the Rosetta Paradox.

This paper aimed at bringing forth and defining the Rosetta Paradox as this very aspect where models excel in highly specialized domains while performing incongruously on general tasks. This paradox points out the inability of current models in AI when these very models have to be used in environments requiring a consistent performance spread over several domains of knowledge.\nOur results indicate that while the domain-specific model BioBERT and LEGAL-BERT achieve a high accuracy in their respective domains, they suffer performance inversions when used for general tasks. This therefore casts doubt on the reliability of the specialized model in real life, where most domains require both domain-specific expertise and general reasoning. In contrast, more generic models such as GPT-3 have more balanced performances without the depth needed in high specialized tasks.\nWe have also proposed measures such as the Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and the Performance Inversion Metric (PIM) that quantify the said performance inversions across tasks. A metric of this nature, when combined with a sound experimental design, provides a holistic method to evaluate specialized and general knowledge.,\nWe have also investigated various mitigation strategies for the Rosetta Paradox: Among others, balanced data pretraining , domain-adaptive finetuning, and continual learning, which aim at setting up models capable of remembering specialized and general knowledge without performance degradation in either domain.

These avenues for continued research will support the maturation of our understanding of how models process knowledge and encourage us toward building more trustworthy adaptive AI systems.\nAddressing the Rosetta Paradox will help us toward the quest of constructing robust AI systems that should be profound yet specialized, broad, generalizable, and turn out to be widely applicable to a variety of real-world tasks and domains."}]}

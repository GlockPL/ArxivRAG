Also, we perform case studies to analyze some features of the model's\nresponse.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Background", "content": "The OpenAI Orion-1 model, commonly referred to as o1, was unveiled on September 12th, 2024, and has\ngarnered significant attention since its release. This model, particularly the o1-preview and o1-mini variants,\nhas been lauded for its advanced reasoning and logical capabilities, particularly in the realms of mathematical\nproblem-solving and coding.\nOne notable feature of the ol models is their exceptional reasoning prowess, setting them apart from other\nLanguage Learning Models (LLMs) such as GPT-40 and Claude 3.5. The ol models' superior reasoning\nabilities are attributed to a novel training approach that involves employing a token-wise reward model\nthrough reinforcement learning. By leveraging this methodology, the o1 models emulate the reasoning and\nreflective processes, thereby fostering an intrinsic chain-of-thought style in token generation. In essence, the\nol model endeavors to formulate plans and subsequently execute them in the process of solving mathematical\nproblems and engaging in other cognitive tasks.\nWhile the o1 models have demonstrated a strong level of reasoning capability, as highlighted by OpenAI's\nclaim that ol-mini's score in the high school AIME math competition is around the top 500 US students, the\nevaluation of these models against a selection of private high school math questions yielded results that were\nnot as impressive as anticipated. This discrepancy has prompted a research inquiry aimed at scientifically\ninvestigating whether the o1 models, akin to other Language Learning Models (LLMs), rely predominantly\non memorizing solution steps in a chain of thought (CoT) fashion, or if they can genuinely generate high-\nquality reasoning steps even for unfamiliar math problems. The primary focus of this research is to assess\nthe generalizability of the ol models' problem-solving abilities. Specifically, the study aims to determine if\nthe ol models possess robust generalizability compared to LLMs like GPT-40 and whether their reasoning\ncapabilities contribute to enhanced problem-solving generalization. Furthermore, the investigation seeks to\nidentify the difficulty level at which the ol models' generalization capabilities significantly surpass those of\nstandard LLMs such as GPT-40.\nTo carry out rigorous research steps towards answering the questions in the above, we adopt a A/B-test\napproach. On the one hand, we construct benchmark problem sets such as the problems in the International\nMathematics Olympiad (IMO), which is considered as the highest level of math competition amongst high\nschool students in mathematics, and these problems have good open access to all the LLMs including o1. On\nthe other hand, we construct a comparable problem set that are considered to have similar difficulty level in\nmathematics, for example, the Chinese Mathematics Olympiad (CMO), that are less accessible to the LLMS\nduring training. Of course, one can still argue that the CMO problems also have open access compared to\nIMO, but CMO problems are less accessible and less likely to be pre-trained by these LLMs. In the end, we\nconstruct a private set of problems in the level of high school mathematics, which is even less likely to be\naccessed by OpenAI, with similar difficulty level compared to IMO problems. These problems are collected\nfrom the Chinese National Team Training camp (CNT), which aims at selecting representative students to\nparticipate IMO each year in China. Comparative statistics between IMO dataset and CNT datasets are\nprovided to investigate on the performance of the ol model.\nAnother approach we adopt after the large scale statistical investigation and tests, is to perform case\nstudy on a few presentative problems. We provide both positive ones and negative ones, with different types\nof pros and cons from a mathematical/logical reasoning perspective.\nThe case studies show that the ol model has a prevalent problem with the \"search\" type of problems.\nThe definition of such a problem and an example is in Section 2. In most situations, the model can only\nsearch for possible valid cases with small numbers or simple functions. Also, for all kinds of questions, the\nmodel sometimes provides skeletal problem-solving steps similar to a correct solution a human contestant\nwould write, but they lack the crucial detailed justification in between. In other situations, the model may\nprovide incorrect intuition.\nThis research contributes to two primary areas. First, it advances the evaluation of AI systems' capabil-\nities in mathematical reasoning and automated theorem proving. Second, it offers an in-depth assessment\nof OpenAI's o1 LLM performance across a broad spectrum of complex reasoning tasks, specifically in the\ncategories of \"search,\" \"solve,\" and \"prove\" for various types of mathematical problems.

{"title": "ScriptViz: A Visualization Tool to Aid Scriptwriting based on a Large Movie Database", "authors": ["Anyi Rao", "Jean-Pe\u00efc Chou", "Maneesh Agrawala"], "abstract": "Scriptwriters usually rely on their mental visualization to create a vivid story by using their imagination to see, feel, and experience the scenes they are writing. Besides mental visualization, they often refer to existing images or scenes in movies and analyze the visual elements to create a certain mood or atmosphere. In this paper, we develop ScriptViz to provide external visualization based on a large movie database for the screenwriting process. It retrieves reference visuals on the fly based on scripts' text and dialogue from a large movie database. The tool provides two types of control on visual elements that enable writers to 1) see exactly what they want with fixed visual elements and 2) see variances in uncertain elements.

While scripts inherently lack visual elements, they must effectively convey visual ideas, which are often as integral as the narrative itself in the story's final cinematic form [22, 44]. Scriptwriters often mentally visualize scenes as they write them to envision how visual attributes of its setting and characters might affect its tone, atmosphere, and character interactions. They use mental visualizations to adjust the script to produce a more visual blueprint for the film. For example, imagining a suspenseful scene taking place at night in a rain-soaked alley between two middle-aged women could help the writer add elements to the scene descriptions and dialogue that evoke film noir.\nOne common method amongst scriptwriters is to ground their scripts using visual references from existing movies. For instance, the scriptwriters for The Silence of the Lambs (1991) used the movie The Manhunter (1986) as a visual reference when writing the conver-sion between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling [59]. Similarly, the scriptwriters for The Dark Knight (2008), used the movie Heat (1995) as a visual reference when writing the dialogue scene be-tween Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth [56].\nAlthough storyborads and moodboards may look similar to our tool, they serve totally different goals. Storyboards typically visu-alize camera angles and character staging for each shot. They are usually used to guide the filming process, but not so much during scriptwriting. Moodboards are often constructed at the same time as writing the script, but they do not visualize the scenes playing out. Our script visualizations fit between these two as they are designed to aid scriptwriting but at the level of visual attributes of the scene rather than camera angles and staging.\nIn this work, we introduce ScriptViz, a tool for scriptwriters to visualize a scene as they are writing it using reference imagery from existing feature films. It retrieves sequences from a pre-processed database of existing movies that match the writer's script and inputs. ScriptViz uses dialogues-aligned visualization and selects frames for each sequence to build a new sequence of illustrations corre-sponding to the writer's evolving script. Our database preprocessing method can successfully retrieve clear frames of establishing shots and characters, offering a tangible cinematic representation of their script to rely on for mental play-through or visual ideation.\nWe pinpoint the visual elements of settings and characters as being instrumental for scriptwriters and support these elements being set as fixed and variable: 1) fixed attributes that scriptwriters have definitive ideas about. For instance, they might envision a specific setting, such as a bedroom, that is crucial to the scene's atmosphere and narrative; 2) variable attributes where scriptwrit-ers seek flexibility and variety, allowing them to explore different possibilities. An example is a character's age, like imagining the character Sarah at various ages to see how it changes the scene's dynamics.\nMore specifically, given a partial script and a specification of fixed and variable visual attributes, ScriptViz identifies scenes from existing films that match the specifications. For each such scene, it retrieves a set of keyframes from the original scene and identifies a keyframe that best presents an establishing shot of the setting. It also assigns characters from the input script to recurring faces in the retrieved keyframes and then chooses a keyframe for each line of dialogue in the script while ensuring that the speaking character is visible in the frame.\nFor instance, in a real scriptwriter usage case, as shown in Fig-ure 1, the visualization helps to add details that better reflect the character's desperate situation. We further demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of our system by showing the results of 3 practical scriptwriting cases in Sec. 5. The user evaluation and comparison with three baselines among 15 scriptwriters in Sec. 6 further shows that the tool is able to aid the scriptwriting process.\nOur work makes two main contributions. (1) We provide a tool that lets scriptwriters visualize their scripts as they are writing them to support brainstorming and planning via retrieving existing movie frames and changing semantic attributes to ensure strong consistency and rich variance. (2) We identify visual attributes of settings and characters that scriptwriters find useful for imagining their scripts. And our user study shows that letting scriptwriters place these attributes into two categories, fixed and variable, enables better brainstorming and planning."}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "Storyboards and moodboards. Storyboards and moodboards are traditional tools integral to the filmmaking process, used to pre-visualize story ideas and scripts [13]. Storyboards, visual se-quences of illustrations, outline each shot to guide the filmmaking process. They detail camera angles and character positions, as-sisting filmmakers in planning and visualizing shot composition post-screenwriting. Conversely, moodboards, which are collections of visuals and text, are employed to convey the overall tone and mood before the scriptwriting process begins. Our script visualiza-tion tool is designed to aid scriptwriters in crafting better stories by providing visualization support during the writing process.\nResearchers have explored various methods to assist storyboard and moodboard visualization. Goldman et al. [25] visualized short videos in a single static image. Rao et al. [52] visualized a storyboard with existing 3D character and motion assets in a 3D virtual envi-ronment. Moodboard tools such as [46] allow creators to compile and organize visual references and color schemes, thereby estab-lishing a cohesive aesthetic vision for their projects [35]. Chou et al. [14] used tropes as an intermediate representation of stories to approach story ideation. While storyboards provide visuals for movement guidance for crew members, and moodboards convey the overall style and feel of the project, ScriptViz focuses on the visualization of a scene in scripts to help scriptwriting.\nVisualizing stories. Researchers have used image generative mod-els [17] to produce images for story visualization, which is aimed at helping viewers see visual imagery related to a story, such as StoryGAN [40] and DUCOStoryGAN [42]. StoryDALL-E [43] fur-ther improves its performance with a pre-trained transformer by leveraging latent knowledge from large-scale datasets. Gong et al. [26] added character images and text as conditions to text-to-image models to increase identity consistency [64] and text-visual align-ment in story visualization. Rahman et al. [51] proposed a novel autoregressive diffusion-based framework with a visual memory module that implicitly captures the actor and background context"}, {"title": "SYSTEM DESIGN", "content": "At the heart of every script lies the potential to transform words into vivid, cinematic experiences. With ScriptViz, our primary goal is to encourage scriptwriters to engage with the visual elements of their storytelling. The design of our tool is specifically tailored to support scriptwriters in both the exploration and refinement of their work's visual dimensions and to understand their implications on the overarching story. The design of our system is motivated by common practices as well as film theory.\nLeveraging existing movies. Building upon traditional visualiza-tion practices like moodboards and storyboards, ScriptViz leverages existing movie footage. On the one hand, it selects sequences that capture the desired attributes as inspiration, akin to how scriptwrit-ers curate visual references on moodboards. On the other hand, drawing upon storyboards, ScriptViz suggests possible outline visu-alizations of the narrative flow with sequences of shots. It achieves this by selecting and rearranging frames within each retrieved se-quence to generate retargeted sequences of shots that align with the script.\nThis approach recontextualizes scenes from existing movies and is informed by montage theory, which posits that the arrangement of shots within a sequence shapes narrative meaning and can thus support different narrative purposes [20]. Besides, the use of a single sequence for each visualization ensures visual and narrative consis-tency, capitalizing on the continuity rules followed in most movie sequences [9]. Drawing from a vast reservoir of well-known films guarantees rich, organic, and diverse illustrations characterized by well-composed frames and compelling character performances.\nDialogue-aligned visualization. To engage scriptwriters with the visual aspect of their story and help them play out the scene more naturally, it's crucial that the retargeted sequences visually align with the input script. This process requires careful consideration of what to depict and when to depict it along the script, maintaining coherence and relevance throughout the sequence.\nGiven that conversations most often drive the progression of film sequences [22] and correspond to over half the shots in most movies [18], ScriptViz associates each line of dialogue with a correspond-ing frame featuring the relevant character. This approach mirrors classic cinematographic techniques, particularly the use of shots and reverse-shots alternately showing the characters conversing on screen to simply convey dialogue-driven scenes. This approach is a clear and immediate portrayal of how a conversation unfolds visually within a scene, providing scriptwriters with a coherent visual reference alongside the dialogue.\nAttributes control. In ScriptViz, we offer controls over fixed and variable attributes to strike a balance between the scriptwriter's vision and the potential for creative exploration. Fixed attributes ensure that the visualizations remain true to the writer's vision and the story's established elements. Illustrations aligned with the writer's ideas can help play out a scene. Conversely, variable at-tributes open the door to different possibilities, encouraging writers"}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "We develop ScriptViz according to the above design ideas, as shown in Figure 2. It contains three parts: (1) preprocess on the database with scene, shot, and frame-level attributes; (2) find the correspond-ing scenes in the database given a request for fixed and variable attributes; (3) choose an establishing frame and frames for each line of dialogue."}, {"title": "Preprocess Database", "content": "To fully support the functionality of ScriptViz to choose frames for each line of dialogue, we need frame-level annotations on 1) setting: a recognizable location, time-of-day, and 2) cast: recogniz-able character identity (the name of actor), gender, and age for all frames as shown in Figure 3.\nScriptViz builds atop MovieNet [30] a database of 1, 100 films annotated at different levels with various attributes such as movie-level genera tags, scene-level location tags, shot-level cinematic style tags, and frame-level character bounding box annotation. A subset of 247 of the MovieNet films has been annotated at the finest level containing about 300K scenes. The annotations include scene boundaries, scene-level location tags $\\text{P}_{loc}$, shot boundaries, keyframes for each shot, and frame-level body bounding boxes annotating an identity tag for each character c\u0130D.\nSetting attributes. Among ~ 300K scenes that we used, each is annotated with location tags from 90 categories, such as living room, restaurant, spaceship, etc as detailed in the supplementary material. We use a time-of-day classifier [61] to assign binary labels \"day or night\" to each frame. For each scene s, we have its setting annotations\n$\\mathbb{P}(s) = {\\text{P}_{loc}, \\text{P}_{time}} $.\nEstablishing shot. A key feature in scriptwriting is to showcase the scene setting with an establishing frame, where the specified location is clearly recognizable [34]. Since close-up and medium shots are used regularly in movies, randomly picking a frame from a random shot in a scene may produce a frame where recognizable features of the location are occluded or unclear. Thus, we annotate each frame with a binary recognizability tag indicating whether the location is recognizable in the frame. To generate the recognizability tag, we compute the visual CLIP [50] embeddings for the keyframe of each shot and the textual CLIP embeddings of the location tag for the shot, which is the same as the scene-level location tag $\\text{P}_{loc}$. We then compute the visual-text cosine similarity between the two embeddings. We treat the similarity score (value between 0 and 1)"}, {"title": "", "content": "as the recognizability score of the location tag in each shot. The higher the score, the more visible the frame presents the location tag. We similarly compute a recognizability score for the time-of-day tag ptime. For each frame f within a shot, we have its setting annotation\n$\\mathbb{P}(f) = {\\text{P}_{loc}, \\text{P}_{loc_{recog}}, \\text{P}_{time}, \\text{P}_{time_{recog}}} $.\nThe establishing shot is the shot with its keyframe achieving the highest score on the sum of recognizability score on location and time-of-day among the scene.\nCast attributes. MovieNet only provides a body bounding box and identity annotation for cast members. Then we run a front face detection [29] to obtain a binary annotation for each character's facial bounding box indicating whether the front of their face is visible. We further measure each character's recognizability in a frame according to the ratio of their body bounding box and the size of the frame, and front face visibility. If the front face is visible and its body bounding box ratio is over 10% of the frame size, its binary recognizability score is 1, which indicates this character can be easily recognized from the frame.\nAs each character in the movie is associated with a cast in real life, we use IMDB [31] to crawl information about a cast on gender, age, country, etc, when he/she stars in the movie. For each scene s, we have its i-th cast's annotation\n$C(s) = {\\text{C}_{ID}^i, \\text{gender}^i, \\text{age}^i} $.\nFor each frame f within a shot, we have its i-th cast's annotation\n$C(f) = {\\text{C}_{ID}^i, c_{recog}^i, \\text{gender}^i, \\text{age}^i} $.\nMeta information. Movies include rich meta information that can provide valuable context and support for script visualization, helping scriptwriters better search for what they want. The movie's title, production year, and genre can give an initial idea of what to expect, helping the scriptwriters anticipate the tone and style of the film's visuals. We associate scenes with the movie they are coming from and assign movie-level annotation to these scenes,\n$M(s) = {S_{year}, S_{genre}, S_{title}} $."}, {"title": "Search Scenes from Database", "content": "The system formulates queries to the database that take user-defined fixed attributes and variable attributes. These queries on fixed at-tributes aim to find scenes that fulfill the specified criteria, ensuring relevance and coherence with the script's narrative. Meanwhile, queries on variable attributes are designed to offer wide options, stimulating writers' creativity and thought processes.\nTo allow flexibility in querying the database and provide desired visualization, we use structured query language (SQL) [33]. SQL en-ables users to specify the attributes that are fixed in their minds and present variance on attributes that are not sure. Exemplar descrip-tions are like this: select Place=Bedroom where MovieYear>1980, Time-of-day=Variable, Character1Gender=Female where Character1Age>40 and Character2=Jean. The user input can be denoted as\n{\\text{P}_{user}, \\text{C}_{user}, \\text{M}_{user}}.\nThe scene search starts from fixed movie-level attributes speci-fied by writers, and keeps movies satisfying the tags, such as movie genre and year. For variable attributes, the system samples movies with distinct values for the variable attributes.\nThen, the method comes to the scene level. 1) For fixed location attributes, if the user's input belongs to the location tag category, it directly keeps scenes with the specified tag. If the user's input does not belong to the existing category, we compute the text-visual cosine similarity between the textual CLIP embedding of user input and the visual CLIP embedding extracted from the establishing shot's keyframe of each scene. ScriptViz returns the scenes in the order of their similarity score. 2) For variable location attributes, the system averagely samples scenes from each location value in the location category list. 3) For character attributes, we keep scenes with character numbers larger than the writer's specification on fixed attributes, and each gender/age number is enough if users specify gender/age. If users do not specify the number of characters in a scene, we will automatically determine it by the script itself.\nSpecifically, this process finds a specific movie scene and assigns casts for each character in the script\n$s^* s.t. P(s^*) \\in \\text{P}_{user}, C(s^*) \\in \\text{C}_{user}, M(s^*) \\in \\text{M}_{user}$."}, {"title": "Visualize Dialogue with Frames", "content": "To further assign frames for each dialogue, we need to assign a cast from the database to each character in the script and make sure the cast in each frame is recognizable. The input script dialogues are formatted in line with the AMPAS [7] standard, with each line explicitly tagged with the name of the character delivering it. The scene search process in Sec. 4.2 keeps scenes where the character number is enough for user-specified fixed character attributes. Since the character number is relatively small, usually less than 5, we enumerate all possible cast choices here to figure out possible cast combinations to assign frames to the dialogue.\nAccording to the writer's SQL input, e.g. Character1Gender=Female, where Character1Age>40, and Character2=Jean, we first assign a cast that satisfies 1-th character's fixed attributes and then do the next. As for the variable character attributes, our system enumerates all the possible casts. This process assigns a cast from the movie database that matches the name, gender, or age depending on users' choices on fixed and variable attributes.\nTo find a frame for a line in the script associated with m-th cast from the movie scene in the database, we find a $f^* e s^*$ from the movie scene that contains the corresponding cast with a recogniz-able front face,\n$f^* s.t.

For each setting or character attribute, we provide a list of possible fixed attributes, e.g. male or female for character gender, day or night for time of day, etc. As for location, we provide a list of commonly used location tags in our supplementary PDF and allow free text input via CLIP-based embedding search, e.g. on the weather.\nModification.

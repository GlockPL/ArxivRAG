Effective crop management requires optimizing yield and economic returns while minimizing environmental impact, a complex sequential decision-making problem well suited for RL. However, the lack of simulators for perennial crops in multi-farm contexts has hindered RL applications in this domain. Existing crop simulators also do not support multiple annual crops. WOFOSTGym addresses these gaps by supporting 23 annual crops and two perennial crops, enabling RL agents to learn diverse agromanagement strategies in multi-year, multi-crop, and multi-farm settings. Our simulator offers a suite of challenging tasks for learning under partial observability, non-Markovian dynamics, and delayed feedback. WOFOSTGym's standard RL interface allows researchers without agricultural expertise to explore a wide range of agromanagement problems. Our experiments demonstrate the learned behaviors across various crop varieties and soil types, highlighting WOFOSTGym's potential for advancing RL-driven decision support in agriculture.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "During a growing season, farmers face many decisions about how to optimally manage their crops to increase yield while reducing cost and environmental impact (Javaid et al., 2023). For example, irrigation planning must account for constraints on water use, and optimal irrigation scheduling can improve crop yield (Elliott et al., 2014). Motivated by the promising results of using reinforcement learning (RL) in other areas of precision agriculture, there is increasing interest from researchers and government agencies in applying RL to crop management decision problems in open-field agriculture, especially for perennial crops (e.g. pears, grapes) (Astill et al., 2020; Gautron et al., 2022a).\nAgriculture presents key challenges for RL, making it a valuable testbed for research: (1) delayed feedback-actions like fertilization affect yield only months later, complicating credit assignment; (2) sparse rewards since yield is only known at the episode's end, learning an optimal policy is difficult (Vecerik et al., 2018); and (3) partial observability\u2014many crop and soil states are unmeasurable or costly to obtain. While RL has been explored as a tool for optimizing open-field crop management decisions (Wu et al., 2022; Tao et al., 2023), its real-world adoption is limited to controlled settings such as greenhouses (An et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020) and crop monitoring (Din et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2020). We bridge this gap by presenting a simulator for annual and perennial crops in single and multi-farm settings.\nTraining RL agents in the real world to optimize agromanagement decisions is infeasible because growing seasons are too long, and unconstrained exploration can cause costly errors like crop death and soil degradation (Tevenart & Brunette, 2021).

POMDPs are well-suited for open-field agriculture problems, since many crop and soilrelated features that are essential for defining the system's full state cannot be directly observed (Tao et al., 2023). Formally, a POMDP is a tuple $M = (S, A, P, R, \\Omega, O)$ where S is a set of states, A is a set of actions, $P : S \\times A \\times S \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the transition kernel, and $R : S \\times A \\rightarrow R$ is the reward function. $\\Omega$ is the set of possible observations and $O : S \\times A \\times \\Omega \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ is the probability of obtaining observation o when taking action a in state s. A reward discount factor $\\gamma$ determines the importance of immediate versus future rewards. The RL agent computes a policy $\\pi : \\Omega \\times A \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ that maximizes the expected sum of discounted rewards, $E_{p^{\\pi}} [\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\gamma^t R(s_t, a_t)]$, where $p^{\\pi}$ is the distribution of states and actions induced by the policy $\\pi$ and T is the time horizon."}, {"title": "RL for Crop Management", "content": "Building on RL's success in robotics, autonomous driving, and health-care, there is growing interest in applying RL to optimize crop yield (Binas et al., 2019). While RL has proven effective in controlled greenhouse environments (An et al., 2021), its application in openfield agriculture remains limited due to reduced sensing capabilities and long growing seasons. Tao et al. (2023) proposed an imitation learning approach to learn expert actions under partial observability, but it has not been tested in the real-world. To bridge this gap, several crop simulators have been developed. CropGym simulates winter wheat in a nitrogen-limited soil via a Gym wrapper around a CGM (Overweg et al., 2021). Gym-DSSAT focuses on maize growth optimization through fertilization and irrigation decisions (Gautron et al., 2022b). CyclesGym, built around the Cycles CGM (Kemanian et al., 2022), focuses on learning crop rotation strategies for annual crops but is limited to soybeans and maize, lacking support for perennial crop modeling (Turchetta et al., 2022).\nExisting crop simulators support RL training for fertilization and irrigation but lack support for perennial crops, a key research area (Gautron et al., 2022a). Additionally, customization is infeasible without expert knowledge of the underlying CGMs, since most CGMs are run through separate executables. In contrast, WOFOSTGym offers easy domain customization for RL researchers while providing high-fidelity parameters for 23 annual and two perennial crops, high-fidelity model parameters for grape phenology for 32 cultivars, and access to diverse soil types and weather patterns."}, {"title": "Crop Growth Models", "content": "Crop Growth Models (CGMs) simulate the growth of crops in varying environments subject to different agromanagement decisions (Jones et al., 2017). Examples of widelyused CGMs include WOFOST (de Wit et al., 2019), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003), APSIM (McCown et al., 1996), EPIC (Cabelguenne et al., 1990), CropSyst (Stockle et al., 1994), Cycles (Kemanian et al., 2022) and AquaCrop (Andarzian et al., 2011). None of the available CGMs support perennial crops. The relevant features of these CGMs are highlighted in the Appendix.\nOur simulator is built on WOFOST, a CGM that models annual crop growth subject to nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and water-limited conditions (van Diepen et al., 1989). We"}, {"title": "3 WOFOSTGym", "content": "WOFOSTGym is built on the WOFOST CGM (van Diepen et al., 1989) and interfaces with the OpenAI Gym API to create a high-fidelity and easy-to-use crop simulator for RL. Agromanagement decisions supported in WOFOSTGym are: fertilizing, irrigating, planting, and harvesting. In the interest of clarity, we focus on fertilization and irrigation decisions in the rest of the paper, since these tasks are supported by all existing crop simulators. In these tasks, the agent must optimize fertilization and irrigation strategies that maximize the cumulative yield of a crop subject to a set of penalties or constraints over one or more growing seasons and across one or more farms.\nThe rest of this section is organized as follows. We begin with an overview of the environment design. We then propose a model calibration method to fine-tune the model parameters of the WOFOST CGM to increase the fidelity as a step towards sim-to-real transfer (Peng et al., 2018)."}, {"title": "3.1 Environment Design", "content": "A WOFOSTGym instance is defined by its Gym environment ID, the reward wrapper, and an agromanagement configuration file. WOFOSTGym contains 54 Gym environments that relate to annual and perennial crop simulation, single and multi-farm simulations, and six combinations of nutrientlimited environments. Our documentation includes three examples on how to modify the reward function, if needed, via the Gym reward wrappers. The agromanagement YAML file defines crop and soil dynamics and specifies the weather data which is provided by NASAPower. Gym environments, reward wrappers, and agromanagement files are configurable, allowing customization to simulate agromanagement decision problems across various crops, farms, and tasks.\nThe model state in WOFOSTGym is the concatenation of two feature vectors, $c = (c_1... c_{203})$ and $w = (w_1,..., w_7)$, where c contains the crop and soil state and w contains the weather state for a given day. However, most of these state features are not directly observable in the real-world. Thus, the state features available to the RL agent are a subset of the model state as observation $o = (C_1, ..., C_n)$, with $n \\ll 210$. An observation could be: o = (Weight of Storage Organs, Development Stage, Leaf Area Index, Soil Moisture Content, Rainfall, Solar Irradiation, Daily Temperature). WOFOSTGym supports any combination of state features as an observation. In the multi-farm environments, the agent receives an observation for each farm and the daily weather observation is shared across farms.\nWOFOSTGym's action space consists of fertilization (F): nitrogen (n), phosphorus (p), and potassium (k), and irrigation (I) actions. At each time step, an action can be chosen from $A = \\{F_n, F_p, F_k, I\\}$ which corresponds to applying fertilizer $(F_i)$ or water $(I)$ in the following amounts, where f, n, i, and m can all be modified:\n$F_i = \\{f \\cdot \\frac{k}{\\text{ha}} | k \\in \\{0...n\\}\\}, I = \\{i \\cdot \\frac{k}{\\text{ha}} | k \\in \\{0...m\\}\\}$\nmeaning that |A| = 3n + m. By default, a time step represents a single day, but can be modified to denote multiple weeks to model the varying length between agromanagement decisions.\nReal-world agriculture requires balancing yield with constraints such as fertilizer costs, water usage limits, and surface runoff restrictions. WOFOSTGym includes reward wrappers to penalize the violation of these constraints. By default, positive reward is a function of crop yield, as profitability is the primary driver of agromanagement policy adoption (Turchetta et al., 2022)."}, {"title": "3.2 Parameter Calibration for Crop Growth Models", "content": "Before a CGM can be used for sim-to-real transfer with RL, it must be calibrated (Bhatia, 2014). CGM parameters are typically derived from field experiments and optimized using regression to find the best fit (Berghuijs et al., 2024; Zapata et al., 2017). Parameter spaces for CGMs are highdimensional and highly non-linear (Sinclair & Seligman, 2000), so brute force and regression techniques that are commonly used in agronomy research may be insufficient to find an optimal solution. To overcome the limitations in current CGM calibration methods, we propose a Bayesian optimization approach that requires minimal domain knowledge and outperforms the regressionbased methods. When historical crop data is available, Bayesian optimization is a more principled way of exploring the parameter space to increase the model fidelity of WOFOSTGym.\nGrape phenology is divided into three key phenological stages: Bud Break, Bloom, and Veraison (Lorenz et al., 1995). Accurately predicting the onset of a phenological stage allows growers to implement effective agromanagement strategies, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the widely accepted measure of performance in grape phenology modeling (Parker et al., 2013). We use an iterative optimization process that uses Bayesian optimization in each iteration to refine parameters and minimize error across all phenological stages. Phenology in WOFOSTGym is described by a set of seven parameters, $\\theta$. Each iteration aligns with minimizing RMSE for a stage k, where $\\theta_k$ is a subset of $\\theta$.\nUsing a dataset of six to 15 years of historical weather and phenology observations per cultivar collected by Zapata et al. (2017), we define the following loss function for Bayesian Optimization:\n$L_{RMSE}(\\theta_k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i (P_k^i(\\theta_k) - O_k^i)^2 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i (P_{k-1}^i(\\theta_k) - O_{k-1}^i)^2$\nwhere $P_k^i(\\theta_k)$ and $O_k^i$ denote the predicted and observed onset day for phenological stage k for year i with parameter set $\\theta_k$. We run three iterations of Bayesian optimization (Noguiera, 2014) with a RBF kernel and the expected improvement acquisition function for 500 steps. By retaining the best-fit parameters found by each iteration, we obtain $\\theta = \\{\\theta_{Bud Break}, \\theta_{Bloom}, \\theta_{Veraison}\\}$, which minimizes the RMSE across all phenological stages. We compare our Bayesian Optimization results with Zapata et al. (2017) who use linear regression. They find parameter sets for grape phenology, BB-T and BL-T6, that aim to minimize the error for Bud Break and Bloom, and report the RMSE for all stages. Our results in Table 2 show that our model outperforms others, providing a 10% reduction in RMSE over the next best parameter set, BB-T."}, {"title": "4 Experiments and Results", "content": "To illustrate the use of WOFOSTGym, we run RL and IL experiments on diverse tasks to learn crop management policies for annual and perennial crops under realistic constraints. We present results using varied crops and soil types, demonstrating WOFOSTGym's customizability. Overall, our results show that off-the-shelf RL algorithms struggle with hard constraints, long horizons, and delayed feedback-challenges inherent to agriculture and captured by WOFOSTGym, making it a valuable platform for both core RL research and agromanagement decision support.\nOur crop selection was guided by common agronomic challenges: wheat and barley for nutrientlimited growth due to their high nitrogen and water demands, and potatoes for soil nutrient runoff risks. We also test with pears and jujubes for the long-horizon decision-making challenges in perennial crop management, and maize as it is the only crop supported by other simulators.\nAgents in our experiments can choose from 16 actions, each corresponding to one of four discrete amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and water. Unless otherwise noted, the agent observes the state features: development stage; weight of storage organs; total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and water applied; soil moisture content; nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in subsoil; solar irradiation; average temperature; and rainfall. For our RL experiments, we use PPO, SAC, and DQN (Schulman et al., 2017; Haarnoja et al., 2018; Mnih et al., 2013), using implementations from Huang et al. (2021) and hyperparameters tuned experimentally to yield best performance in the WOFOSTGym domain. For our IL experiments, we use implementations from Gleave et al. (2022) of BC, GAIL, and AIRL (Bain & Sammut, 2000; Ho & Ermon, 2016; Fu et al., 2018). GAIL and AIRL use a PPO policy, and BC uses an Actor Critic Policy, all written by Raffin et al. (2021).

To model this, we reward total yield and apply a large negative penalty if the fertilization and irrigation thresholds (in kg/ha and cm/ha) are exceeded. Figure 3 shows the results of RL algorithms with this reward function; positive reward indicates no constraint violation, rewards less than zero indicate a constraint violation, and rewards less than \u2013105 indicate more than 5 constraint violations. Note that unlike the previous experiment, there is no principled way to find the maximum reward obtainable in this setting. We compare the RL agents to a baseline that applies nitrogen fertilizer and water until it meets the same thresholds of 80 kg/ha of fertilizer or 40 cm/ha of water (Bushong et al., 2016). While this baseline satisfies constraints, it achieves a lower average reward than the trained RL agents.

Given the large potential overhead when resetting the underlying CGM, we also measure the run times of the step and reset functions.

(2019); Wang et al. (2022), establishing it as a solid foundation for developing a perennial crop simulator. Below, we outline the key modifications we made to WOFOST to support perennial crop modeling.\nPerennial Phenology We primarily focused on modifying the phenology submodule within the WOFOST CGM to account for the differences between annual and perennial crop phenology. Unlike annual crops, the phenology of perennial crops is characterized by a dormancy stage induced by day length in autumn and released by temperature in spring (Rohde & Bhalerao, 2007). To capture this behavior, we introduced parameters for dormancy induction based on day length, release temperature threshold, and minimum dormancy duration. In our modified WOFOST CGM, dormancy can also be triggered by prolonged growth stagnation, indicating insufficient ambient temperature for crop growth (Jones et al., 1978).\nPerennial Organ Growth In addition to differences in phenology, perennial crops exhibit differences in their visible growth organs (Thomas et al., 2000). The roots and stems of perennial crops survive year-round, while the leaves and storage organs regrow each season subject to intercepted light and nutrient uptake. Crop organ death rates are modeled as a function of the development stage of the crop (Lind\u00e9n et al., 1996). Notably, perennials exhibit a reduced seasonal growth as they age (Munn\u00e9-Bosch, 2007). While the underlying mechanisms for reduced growth remain difficult to quantify, we model this decline empirically through increased maintenance respiration and decreased carbon conversion efficiency as a function of age (Zhu et al., 2021).\nModified Nutrient Module A multi-layer nutrient balance is important for modeling the effects of fertilization stressors on the roots, stems, and nutrient partitioning (Albornoz, 2016). We extend WOFOST's single-layer nutrient balance to a multi-layered nutrient balance within the soil module (He et al., 2013). When nutrients are applied via fertilization, they reside on the soil surface. As the simulation evolves, nutrients are absorbed into the subsoil and then the roots of the plant. When surface nutrient levels are too high, the partitioning of dry matter is changed to limit allocation to the storage organs in favor of stems and leaves (He et al., 2013)."}, {"title": "B Available Crops", "content": "WOFOSTGym includes parameters for two perennial crops: pear and jujube, and 23 annual crops: barley, cassava, chickpea, cotton, cowpea, faba bean, groundnut, maize, millet, mung bean, pigeon pea, potato, rapeseed, rice, onion, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugarcane, sunflower, sweet potato, tobacco, and wheat. Each crop contains between one and ten varieties. WOFOST CGM parameters for each variety were calibrated empirically from field data (de Wit, 2025). By modeling each crop variety as a task, agromanagement decisions for multiple crop varieties can be optimized with multitask RL (Hessel et al., 2019).\nIn addition to the high-fidelity models for 25 crops, WOFOSTGym also includes parameters for modeling the phenology of 32 grape cultivars. These cultivars are: Aligote, Alvarinho, Auxerrois, Barbera, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Concord, Dolcetto, Durif, Gewurztraminer, Green Veltliner, Grenache, Lemberger, Malbec, Melon, Merlot, Muscat Blanc, Nebbiolo, Petit Verdot, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, and Zinfandel."}, {"title": "C Crop Growth Models", "content": "CGMs are typically one of three types: mechanistic, empirical, or hybrid. Mechanistic models simulate canopy or nutrient level crop processes to validate scientific understanding of crop growth (Estes et al., 2013). Empirical models rely on observed field data, offering greater scalability with lower computational overhead (Di Paola et al., 2016). Hybrid crop models simulate crop growth using both mechanistic and empirical modeling decisions (Yang et al., 2004).\nWOFOST is a single-year and multi-crop agroecosystem model (Jones et al., 2017). It relies both on mechanistic and empirical processes to simulate crop growth (Di Paola et al., 2016). Crop growth in WOFOST is determined by the atmospheric CO2 concentration, irradiation, daily temperature, subject to limited water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. While WOFOST was designed for simulating the yield of annual crops (van Diepen et al., 1989), field studies have shown that it can be used to accurately predict yield in perennial fruit trees with some small modifications to the base model Wang et al. (2022); Bai et al. (2019)\nGiven WOFOST's ability to simulate a wide variety of crop and soil dynamics, and its modular implementation in Python, WOFOST is an ideal CGM candidate to be used to simulate perennial crop growth to address that lack of perennial CGMs available, and the lack of perennial crop benchmarks available for RL research (Gautron et al., 2022a).

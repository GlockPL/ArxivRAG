INTRODUCTION", "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Intelligent Reflect-ing Surfaces (IRS) are transforming wireless communication systems, signifying a major technological advancement. UAVs, initially deployed for military applications, now serve in di-verse commercial and research roles due to their autonomous operation and remote-control capabilities. They can function as mobile base stations or communication relays, which en-hances network reach, throughput, and reliability [1]. Their versatility extends to advanced data collection, surveillance, and load balancing [2]. Meanwhile, IRS technology introduces a new paradigm with programmable environments composed of passive elements capable of modulating electromagnetic waves in real-time [3]. This innovation optimizes radio signal propagation by reducing interference, improving signal quality, and overcoming multi-path fading [4].\nThe convergence of UAVs and IRS technology has paved the way for more adaptable and efficient wireless networks. This combination of UAVs' mobility and IRSs' signal opti-mization creates a dynamic and flexible wireless landscape. The integration enables networks to overcome signal blockage, coverage limitations, and connectivity issues, especially in areas underserved by conventional infrastructure [5]. It also provides fine-tuned solutions to problems like interference management and signal fading [6]. However, merging UAVs with IRS introduces security challenges due to the airborne nature of UAVs and the passive techniques used by IRS [7].\nSecurity in this combined technological environment is cru-cial. Ensuring the secrecy of UAV-to-UAV communication involves addressing large-scale fading channels and detecting UAV eavesdroppers [8] [9]. Proposed techniques to augment UAV security include jamming [10], trajectory alterations [11], and artificial noise [12]. A notable method involves using IRS to improve secure communication [13]. By adjusting phase shifts, IRS can boost the signal-to-noise ratio for legitimate users while diminishing it for eavesdroppers, creating a potent strategy to enhance communication security without increasing power allocation [14]. As research in this field progresses, the challenge remains to optimize the phase shifts of IRS and the trajectories of UAVs to maintain robust and secure wireless networks.\nDeploying these technologies, however, presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the realms of security, energy efficiency, and the requirement for intelligent management sys-tems. The security of UAV-assisted communication networks is paramount, particularly in sensitive applications. Measures must be taken to ensure data integrity, prevent unauthorized access, and protect against cyber threats to maintain the reliability of these systems. Additionally, the energy efficiency of both UAVs and IRS is of critical importance, as the sustainability of these technologies relies on their ability to operate with minimal energy consumption while still maintaining high performance. Addressing these challenges, machine learning (ML) plays an indispensable role. ML algorithms can significantly optimize the performance of IRS-assisted UAV systems by intelligently managing resources, enhancing signal processing, and ensuring secure communications.\nVarious surveys have explored IRS-assisted UAV communi-cation systems, each with their specific focus and methodolo-gies. Some works delve deeply into IRS technologies, while [15] focus more on the UAV aspect. Methodologically, surveys like [16] lean towards optimization algorithms. In terms of security and privacy, may emphasize technical performance or deployment strategies more than security aspects, and in the realm of energy efficiency, studies like [17] do not prioritize it as a primary focus.\nThis paper presents a distinct approach in the landscape of IRS-assisted UAV communication systems. It offers a comprehensive overview, emphasizing secure, energy-efficient IRS-assisted UAV systems with a special focus on machine learning. This survey not only highlights the technological synergy between UAVs and IRS but also integrates machine learning as a core methodology, setting it apart from the afore-mentioned studies. The survey addresses specific challenges and future research directions related to security, energy, and machine learning implementation, offering insights into areas less explored in other surveys. The integration of machine learning, particularly for optimizing system performance and security, underscores the unique contribution of this survey to the existing body of literature.\nThe paper is structured as follows:. Section II covers energy efficiency, detailing models for optimizing energy use while ensuring high performance. Section III discusses security in IRS-assisted UAV communications, analyzing challenges and solutions. Section IV explores the role of Machine Learning (ML) in enhancing the IRS-UAV framework.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN IRS-ASSISTED UAV COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", "content": "Energy efficiency is a critical factor in the implementation of all systems, particularly in wireless communications where it greatly influences system performance and device size. As such, energy efficiency is considered one of the most fundamental performance criteria, alongside spectral efficiency. This section introduces research trends in IRS-assisted UAV communica-tions systems from the perspective of energy efficiency.\nIn the realm of IRS-assisted UAV communications, signifi-cant research has been conducted to optimize energy efficiency. For instance, [18] investigated how to maximize the received power of ground users using a single UAV and multiple IRSS, revealing that the energy efficiency of such systems is highly dependent on the number of IRS elements. Another critical research, [19], aimed to minimize UAV power consumption using a Decaying Deep Q-Network (D-DQN), which is an adaptation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm with a decaying learning rate. This study was pivotal in comparing the performance of Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems in terms of energy efficiency.\nThe pursuit of enhanced energy efficiency has also led to novel approaches in multicell uplink systems using aerial base stations, particularly UAV-mounted IRS systems. In [20], the optimization of energy efficiency in IRS-assisted UAV com-munication systems is discussed. However, these UAVs often face challenges like obstructed UAV-to-ground links, leading to increased task latency. To address this, configuring the IRS to improve the propagation channels between the UAV and ground terminals becomes essential, thereby enhancing MEC performance and wireless communications. Similarly, [21] ex-plored resource allocation strategies involving UAV trajectory and velocity to minimize the system's average total power con-sumption. Moreover, [22] aimed to enhance UAV connectivity and energy efficiency by maximizing the number of connectable devices during activation periods, showcasing the effectiveness of large-sized IRSs.

This involves optimizing the configuration of the beamforming weight matrix to elevate the secrecy rate of communications. Building on these insights, research such as [31] has introduced innovative power control strategies for UAVs. These strategies are designed to further increase the average secrecy rate, thereby enhancing the security of data transmissions. Additionally, [29] explores the probability of establishing Line-of-Sight (LoS) links within UAV communication systems, paying special attention to the impact of IRS deployment on these probabilities. In tackling the challenge of secure data transmission within IRS-supported UAV millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication networks, [32] adopts a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methodology.

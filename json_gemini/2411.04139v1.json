In 6G-enable Vehicular Metaverses, vehicles are represented by Vehicle Twins (VTs), which serve as digital replicas of physical vehicles to support real-time vehicular applications such as large Artificial Intelligence (AI) model-based Augmented Reality (AR) navigation, called VT tasks. VT tasks are resource-intensive and need to be offloaded to ground Base Stations (BSs) for fast processing.

As a promising solution, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) act as aerial edge servers to dynamically assist ground BSs in handling VT tasks, relieving resource pressure on ground BSs. However, due to high mobility of UAVs, there exists information asymmetry regarding VT task demands between UAVs and ground BSs, resulting in inefficient resource allocation of UAVs. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based Modified Second-Bid (MSB) auction mechanism to optimize resource allocation between ground BSs and UAVs by accounting for VT task latency and accuracy.

Vehicle Twins (VTs) are digital replicas of physical vehicles within 3D virtual environments, offering accurate lifecycle representations and managing vehicular applications like large Artificial Intelligence (AI) model-based Augmented Reality (AR) navigation [2]. In 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses, vehicular users can receive large AI model-based vehicular services called VT tasks by constructing and updating the VTs in nearby terrestrial infrastructure like ground Base Stations (BSs). Given limited coverage of ground BSs and rapid movement of vehicles, a single ground BS is unable to continuously provide immersive vehicular services to vehicular users [3]. Consequently, to ensure an uninterrupted and immersive vehicular user experience, VT tasks must be migrated to the next ground BS as the vehicle is about to exit the coverage of the current ground BS [4]. Recently, integrating Vehicular Metaverses into urban environments represents a significant advancement in immersive experiences, where users can interact with digital content in real time through large AI model-based vehicular systems [5]. However, as the scale of the Vehicular Metaverse expands and the number of vehicular users increases, a critical challenge emerges when VT tasks are migrated, particularly large AI model-based VT tasks, i.e., network resource limitation. This issue becomes particularly prominent in areas with high vehicular user density, such as intersections, urban zones, and commercial zones, where seamless communication and immersive Vehicular Metaverse services are required. To address these challenges, air-ground integrated networks, composed of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and ground BSs, provide dynamic resource allocation, expanding network coverage and alleviating communication bottlenecks in densely populated zones [6,7]. Therefore, the capability of air-ground integrated networks to dynamically manage resources can particularly enhance service quality in user-dense regions, offering timely responses and improving the quality of experience of vehicular users.\nIn air-ground integrated networks, ground BSs and UAVs serve as critical resource providers, delivering computing and communication resources to support executing VT tasks migration within 6G-enable Vehicular Metaverses [8]. These VT task migrations often require continuous and high-quality resource allocation, especially for large AI model-based VT tasks, which is essential for maintaining an immersive experience for vehicular users. However, the dynamic nature of resource demand in vehicular environments presents challenges, e.g., the information asymmetry between ground BSs and UAVs regarding the demand for VT task migration. Specifically, ground BSs can utilize historical data to accurately predict and assess the resource requirements of vehicular users with their fixed infrastructures and stable operations [9]. Although UAVs can offer flexible and dynamic coverages, they face challenges in collecting real-time feedback due to their mobility. Therefore, this mobility results in delayed information gathering (i.e., the demand for VT task migration), leading to less precise estimations of resource valuation compared to ground BSs [10].\nTo effectively address the resource allocation challenges in air-ground integrated networks, where ground BSs and UAVs serve as critical resource providers for vehicular users executing VT tasks in Vehicular Metaverses, it is essential to design mechanisms that mitigate the information asymmetry between these resource providers [11]. Traditional auction mechanisms, such as first-price or second-price auctions, often lead to inefficient resource allocation due to strategic bidding and adverse selection, which is not suitable for solving the resource allocation challenges in air-ground integration networks. The Modified Second Bid (MSB) auction offers significant advantages by incorporating a price scaling factor that ensures more efficient resource pricing and allocation. As introduced in [12], the MSB auction is strategy-proof and effectively eliminates adverse selection, making it a robust solution in environments characterized by information asymmetry [13]. Therefore, we propose a new MSB auction mechanism that evaluates resource allocation based on two key metrics, i.e., the latency of processing VT tasks and the precision of these VT task outcomes (e.g., resolution or pixel accuracy), which represent the common value and match value of resource provider, respectively.\nThe rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents transformative potential, surpassing conventional AI paradigms by incorporating a wide range of models and methodologies, e.g., Transformer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) [14]. Among these, GDMs are particularly noteworthy due to their unique approach to data generation and their ability to model complex data distributions with high precision [15]. By incorporating the diffusion model and Reinforcement Learning (RL), we propose a Diffusion-based RL algorithm, which is a generative approach that excels at learning and representing intricate environments through noise injection and denoising processes [14]. In this paper, we employ the Diffusion-based RL algorithm to solve the MSB auction problem, optimizing the price scaling factor to maximize the surplus of resource providers and minimize the latency of VT tasks. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 We propose a new resource allocation framework to address information asymmetry between UAVs and ground BSs due to the demand for VT task migration, providing an immersive experience for vehicular users in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses.\n\u2022 In this framework, we design a new MSB auction, considering the VT task latency and the accuracy of these VT tasks (i.e., pixel points or resolution). Additionally, we prove that the proposed MSB auction is strategy-proof and effectively eliminates adverse selection, making it a robust solution in environments characterized by information asymmetry.\n\u2022 Unlike traditional DRL, we propose a Diffusion-based RL algorithm that has powerful learning and characterization capabilities, applying the MSB auction system to maximize the total surplus of resource providers and minimize the average latency of VT tasks.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows.

By establishing an interconnected and immersive universe, the metaverse establishes a framework that fosters real-time communication and dynamic interactions with digital artifacts [17]. The metaverse was derived from the fusion of the prefix \"meta\" (signifying transcendence), and the suffix \"verse\" (abbreviated form of the universe), which denotes a computer-generated realm that parallels the real world [18]. Currently, utilizing the metaverse finds implementation across various industries, notably within the automotive sector. Amidst the swift advancement of technologies encompassing AI, blockchain, and 6G, the attainment of an immersive Vehicular Metaverses experience emerges as a pivotal trend in the prospective evolution of the intelligent connected automobile industry [5]. The authors in [19] introduced the term \u201cVetaverse\u201d, which amalgamates \u201cvehicle\u201d and \u201cmetaverse\u201d, symbolizing the convergence of the automotive industry and the metaverse domain. In transportation systems, Vehicular Metaverses can provide fully immersive and hyper-realistic metaverse services to metaverse users inside the vehicles through ground BSs, e.g., passengers can not only observe the scenery outside the vehicles but also see AR recommendations covering real-world landmarks and landscapes through the Head-Up Displays (HUDs) [20]. The Vehicular Metaverse is delineated as an immersive integration of vehicular communication that amalgamates the virtual space with real-world data [21]. It is esteemed as an emergent paradigm entailing profound fusion between the Internet of Vehicles and the metaverse domain, thereby furnishing metaverse users with nascent vehicular virtual services.\nThe physical-virtual synchronization system of the Vehicular Metaverse involves two phases. In the Physical-to-Virtual (P2V) phase, vehicles use sensors to perceive the environment and update the Digital Twins (DTs) in the virtual world with historical sensor and passenger biometric data [21]. In the Virtual-to-Physical (V2P) phase, the resource providers provide metaverse services to metaverse users through DTs, bridging the virtual and physical realms [21]. DTs are virtual counterparts that faithfully represent the complete life cycle of physical objects in a virtual environment [22]. Similarly, VTs serve as comprehensive digital counterparts, encompassing the lifespan of different immersive metaverse services such as large AI model-based AR navigation, which can meet the requirements of metaverse users. The dynamic physical world of vehicles encompasses critical information and attributes of tangible entities, requiring continuous updates to the real-world characteristics of VTs within the virtual environment [23]."}, {"title": "2.2 Resource Allocation in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses", "content": "Providing services to metaverse users by constructing and updating VTs requires a lot of resources, including computing resources to perform intensive tasks, storage resources, and bandwidth resources necessary to maintain ultra-high-speed and low-latency connections [24]. Consequently, addressing resource allocation challenges is crucial to incentivize resource providers in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses. In [1], the authors presented a framework that leverages both blockchain technology and game theory to optimize the allocation of resources for VTs migration in vehicular networks. In [25], the authors proposed an incentive mechanism using the Age of Migration Task theory to ensure efficient bandwidth distribution for VTs migration in the Vehicular Metaverses. Although both studies provide theories such as game theory and contract theory to solve the resource allocation problem in Vehicular Metaverses, they do not consider the resource allocation in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses. In [26], the authors presented a novel approach for efficiently supporting metaverse streaming over 6G mobile networks by employing Neyman-Pearson criterion-driven Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, to address the challenges of delay and bandwidth demands. However, this work primarily focuses on network optimization rather than a market-based resource allocation mechanism.

Among these, GDMs stand out for their unique data generation process and their ability to model complex data distributions with high precision [15]. GDMs work by adding noise to data and then gradually denoising it, making them highly effective in modeling intricate and dynamic environments [29]. This step-by-step approach allows GDMs to capture uncertainties and long-term dependencies, particularly suited to auctions, i.e., predicting bidder behavior and optimizing auction strategies in highly competitive and unpredictable environments.\nIn [30], the authors introduced an attribute-aware auction-based mechanism for optimizing resource allocation during the migration of VTs in Vehicular Metaverses, utilizing a two-stage matching process and a GPT-based DRL auctioneer. In [31], the authors proposed DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for auto-bidding in online advertising, addresses the limitations of traditional systems based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which struggle in dynamic, long-term environments. DiffBid models the entire bid trajectory and proves its effectiveness with experiments, showing the strong ability of GDM to generate more accurate bids in a dynamic environment. Despite these advancements, the application of Diffusion-based MSB auctions has to be explored to address resource allocation challenges (i.e., the information asymmetry between UAVs and ground BSs due to dynamic demands of VT tasks) in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses. This gap presents an opportunity to leverage Diffusion-based MSB auctions to enhance the efficiency of resource distribution within 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses."}, {"title": "3 System Model", "content": "The system comprises N + 1 computing and communication resource providers, including one or several UAVs and multiple ground BSs equipped with edge servers, as shown in Fig. 1.

The set of vehicular users, that request the processing of VT tasks, is represented by M = {1,\u2026,m,\u2026\u2026, M}. Specifically, at time slot t, when vehicles leave the coverage of the current ground BS, vehicular users send requirements for processing VT tasks, which are handled by either a UAV or one of the ground BSs, depending on resource availability of resource providers and the Diffusion-based MSB (DMSB) auction results. In our system model, an accuracy of processing VT tasks required by vehicular user m is considered fixed and independent of the computing resources or bandwidth used [32]. For example, we consider a large A\u0399 model-based VT task for pedestrian detection required by vehicular user m. In this task, the camera of a vehicle captures frames of its surrounding environment, consisting of multiple pixel points. We denote Nm = {wm, wm,\u2026, wm} as the visual information required to be processed by a UAV or a ground BS.

The brand bidder refers to the UAV, which like traditional brand advertisers [12], focuses on broad objectives such as improving coverage or network reliability, but cannot accurately assess the value of individual VT tasks. Conversely, performance bidders are ground BSs, can evaluate each VT task based on key performance metrics [12], such as low latency and high accuracy, and bid accordingly. The MSB auction allocates VT tasks by comparing the submitted bids and determining the winner based on a price scaling factor p. Specifically, the highest ground BS wins the VT task if it exceeds the second-highest bid by at least p, and the payment is determined by scaling the second-highest bid with p. If no ground BS satisfies this condition, the VT task is allocated to the UAV, and the contracted payment is determined by maximizing the expected profit on the highest possible value of bo [12], calculated as\nbo = maxb E[(vo - Umax)1(Vmax \u2264 bo)], (13)\nwhere vo is the valuation of the VT task measured by the UAV, and Umax is the highest valuation.

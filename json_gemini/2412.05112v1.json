However, excessive arousal in a single task has drawbacks, such as overlooking events outside of the task. To examine such a negative aspect, this study constructs a computational model of arousal dynamics where the excessively increased arousal makes the task transition difficult. The model was developed using functions integrated into the cognitive architecture Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R). Under the framework, arousal is treated as a coefficient affecting the overall activation level in the model. In our simulations, we set up two conditions demanding low and high arousal, trying to replicate corresponding human experiments. In each simulation condition, two sets of ACT-R parameters were assumed from the different interpretations of the human experimental settings. The results showed consistency of behavior between humans and models both in the two different simulation settings. This result suggests the validity of our assumptions and has implications of controlling arousal in our daily life.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Concentrating on the task at hand, which sometimes relates to psychological states called immersion or flow\u00b9, is widely acknowledged as a precursor to achieving high performance in the task [8]. During such states, intensified concentration, coupled with a feeling of absolute control over the task, can foster creative outcomes, albeit sometimes at the cost of losing self-consciousness.\nThis paper endeavors to construct a computational model elucidating the psychophysiological dynamics underlying an immersive state. Our model places particular emphasis on arousal, defined as \"a state of physiological activation or cortical responsiveness, associated with sensory stimulation and activation of fibers from the reticular activating system [35].\" From this definition, we understand arousal as activated brain states, which also relate to attention. One famous theory on the relation between arousal (activation) and attention is the cue utilization theory [11], which points out that intensified arousal narrows attention to the external environment.\nIn contrast to simple explanations of concentration based solely on the level of attention, those based on arousal connect to fundamental factors related to emotion and physiology (e.g., [30]). Regarding such factors, the existence of an optimal level of arousal has been pointed out in several theories [8,27,39], which suggest that both excessively high and exceedingly low arousal levels compared to the optimal level have detrimental effects on task motivation. In essence, task motivation is related with arousal level through an inverted U-shaped function, with the peak determined by task difficulty."}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "This study combines primitive functions in ACT-R to explain arousal dynamics leading to deficits in attention allocation. This section presents general surveys on computational models of physiological mechanism and surveys focusing on research using ACT-R to explain arousal dynamics and multitasking."}, {"title": "2.1 Computational Models of Biological Homeostasis", "content": "Physiological processes drive human arousal. Therefore, the optimal level of arousal described in the previous section can be interpreted in the context of homeostasis maintenance, which is a general self-regulating process that maintains its optimal values of physiological variables [5,6]. According to this theory, organisms can adapt to changing environments because of homeostasis.\nComputationally, homeostasis has been explained by the theory of predictive coding [7,14,28,33], which posits that organisms desire to minimize long-term mismatches (errors, surprises) between predictions from experience and perceptions of the external environment. There are several ways to reduce these discrepancies. One way is to master the task so that the prediction is accurate and performance is close to the predicted states. However, mastering a particular task also induces mismatches in the future environment. Thus, the theory describes human behavior as a balance between minimizing prediction error for the current task (i.e., exploitation) and increasing prediction accuracy in future environments (i.e., exploration) [32]. Such a balancing behavior links to the optimal arousal theory by directly connecting surprises generated by prediction errors to arousal potential [37].\nThe relationship between prediction error and arousal (activation) is also explained by the Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory [34]. This theory explains the function of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as the coordinator of human behavior by minimizing the difference between expected and actual rewards (reward prediction error). These coordination functions are instantiated as an EVC value, which is computed from two components: \"identity,\" which is a control signal distinguishing several goals, and \"intensity,\" which is activation of neurons relating to each control signal. The function is balanced by an expected reward and cost polynomial, and the EVC value draws an inverse U-shape when \"intensity\" is manipulated. Organisms are considered to choose the behavior with the highest EVC value.\nSo far, we have introduced theories explaining the inverted U-shaped relationship between task motivation/performance and arousl levels. A fundamental principle across these theories is the self-regulation mechanism of arousal. The continuation of the same task leads to the saturation of prediction errors, increasing the desire to explore new environments [32]. However, the above theories has difficulty describing the detailed and concrete process of arousal changing over time. To solve this problem, we need a process model in which several components are interacted."}, {"title": "2.2 ACT-R Models Regarding Arousal Dynamics", "content": "As noted in Section 1, this study uses ACT-R to model cognitive processes relating to arousal dynamics. Several researchers have developed ACT-R models explaining how inappropriate arousal levels affect task motivation/performance. For example, Vugt et al. [36] developed a model of mind-wandering using the activation mechanism of ACT-R. In their model, mind-wandering is represented as memory recalls of task-unrelated contents. Through the execution of the monotonous task, the activation of these memory contents is gradually strengthened, eventually leading to mind-wandering and performance decline.\nOther studies have focused on fatigue, a psychophysiological state associated with low arousal. Gunzelmann et al. [16] constructed a model representing the effects of fatigue on the execution of a continuous perceptual-motor coordination task. Specifically, they manipulated the parameter relating to the computations of selection probability of specific action to execute the task. Gunzelmann et al. [17] also constructed a mechanism for fatigue in memory activation, which affects the success of memory retrieval during the task. These changes in numerical parameters of ACT-R can define an inverse U-shaped curve representing the relation between the task continuation and performance measured by reaction time [4] 3.\nFurthermore, another ACT-R model explains motivation related to arousal using the EVC theory presented in the previous section. Yang and Stocco [38] represents \"identity\" in EVC theory as the goal contents of ACT-R and \"intensity\" as activation of the goal. In their study, the U-shaped curve of the optimal arousal level was reproduced when several conflict goals existed.\nHowever, these studies have not explicitly discussed the correspondence of these parameter changes to human physiological mechanisms. Concerning the logic behind these mechanisms, Ritter [29] defined emotion as physiological substrates affecting cognitive parameters. This idea has been instantiated in ACT-R/\u03a6 [9], which combines cognitive processes in ACT-R with physiological mechanisms. Although this ACT-R extension successfully demonstrates the complex dynamics that emerge from interactions between physiology and cognitive components, it does not explain how those relations change over time.\nBased on the above research, Nishikawa et al. [26] constructed a model of a perceptual-motor coordination process accompanied by mind-wandering. By extending the previous studies [9,36], their model defined arousal as the fluctuation (noise) of activation for the goals of the models. When the model falls into a low arousal state, the activation of the goal more fluctuated, and memory contents outside of the task tend to be more recalled. Following this, Nagashima et al. [25] attempted to model the optimal level of arousal. This model leveraged the ACT-R module called tracker, which represents the nonlinear function of skill mastery [13] and allows to simulate the process of acquiring motor skills in a rapid perceptual and motor coordination task [3,15]."}, {"title": "2.3 ACT-R Models Regarding Multitasking", "content": "Several multitasking models employing ACT-R exist, elucidating a performance decline in such situations (see [31]). However, most of these models do not integrate arousal dynamics. Rather, they explain the performance deficit in multitasking as a scheduling problem. For example, Kujala and Salvucci [22] constructed a model of dual-tasking, where drivers are required to"}, {"title": "3 Task and Data", "content": "We set up a line-following task [23], which was used by Nishikawa et al. [26], as multitasking to examine the effects of arousal dynamics.  As the main goal of this task, participants operate the blue circle to follow a polyline that is displayed on the screen, automatically scrolling from top to bottom. The line varied according to a predefined course, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1. These courses involve connecting patterns of lines with a height of 48 pixels at angles of 30, 45, 90, 135, and 150 degrees (0 degrees as the horizontal line).\nThe circle is moved by pressing the specified key. When a key is pressed during screen refresh, the circle moves two pixels in the direction indicated by the key. This specific amount of movement maintains the positional relationship between the line and the circle during the scrolling of the 30 and 150-degree lines. In other words, when the 30 and 150-degree lines continue, the key can be pressed continuously to successfully follow the lines. However, for a 45 or 135-degree course, intermittent key presses and releases are necessary to prevent excessive movement of the circle.\nAs a subgoal of this task, the participants are required to respond to probes (the bottom of Fig. 1) asking the state of concentration on the task. The probes are presented in average 50-sec intervals with noise which is randomly sampled from a normal distribution with a 5-sec standard deviation. Therefore, the number of times the probes are presented for the task is not constant. Also, if a participant does not respond before the next presentation cycle of a probe, that probe is skipped, and the next one is presented without interruption.\nIn the experiment, the difficulty of the task was adjusted by manipulating parameters such as the ratio of vertical lines in the line pattern and the scrolling speed. Specifically, the former parameter was represented by the simple and difficult courses in the right panel of Fig. 1. For both courses, the scrolling speed was set to complete one round in one minute. The resulted parameters are shown in the second and third columns of Table 1.\nWe assume that these different conditions require varying levels of arousal. Therefore, in this paper, we refer to the condition where a simple course scrolls at a slow speed as the \"low arousal demand (LAD) condition\" and the other as the \"high arousal demand (HAD) condition.\" These labels indicate that the conditions do not necessarily reflect participants' actual arousal levels but instead represent the arousal levels required for the task.\nIn addition to the task difficulty, we manipulated goal setting. Based on a theory of motivation [1], the arousal level for a task is assumed to be influenced by this factor. Consequently, in the HAD condition, participants were presented with the highest score achieved in the previous rounds up to that point in the task, and they were instructed to aim to surpass that score. The score here indicated the percentage of frames in which the line was successfully traced during the round."}, {"title": "3.2 Human Behavioral Data", "content": "The data were collected through a Japanese crowdsourcing site (Lancers.jp). We posted a call for up to 50 participants on the crowdsourcing site for each condition (100 participants, including both conditions).\nIn both conditions, the participants were forwarded from the crowdsourcing site to a website on the authors' server. At the site, they engaged in the line-following task for 30 min after entering their user identification of the crowdsourcing service and reading the instructions for the task on the screen. At the instruction page, they were posed quizzes to confirm their understanding of the instructions.\nThe call was closed when the number of participants registered on the crowdsourcing site reached the limit. Then, we used all the data on the server, which recorded valid user identification and 30-min behavior logs of the task (position of the circle and lines for each frame, timing of probe presentations, and responses). As a result, we obtained the data from 24 participants in the LAD condition and 39 in the HAD condition for the target of modeling.\nThe trends of the performance of the main and sub goals for the LAD (n = 24) and HAD (n = 39) conditions are summarized in Fig. 2. The horizontal axes represent 30 time points corresponding one-min rounds, while the vertical axes indicate the performance of the main and sub goals, averaged across participants in each condition. The performance of the main goal is represented as logarithmic offline ratios (the percentage of frames where the circle did not follow the line out of the total frames in a round). In contrast, subgoal performance is measured by probe response time (the time between the probe's appearance and the button press) for each instance of the probe. For the probe response time, we separately presented the means and the standard deviations across the participants because we considered that overlooking subgoal-related stimuli is reflected in the variance of the response time.\nAs a preprocessing step, we calculated the average of the probe responses when multiple responses were recorded within the same round. Additionally, if participants did not respond to a probe before the next one appeared, the response time for that probe was recorded as 50 sec, representing the expected maximum value. The subsequent probe following the non-responded probe, which appeared continuously on the screen, was treated as missing data and was not included in the statistical analysis. While there were no missing data in the LAD condition, 12 probe responses were treated as missing in the HAD condition.\nFor each measure of the performance in figures, we conducted a quadratic regression analysis by setting a significance level at 0.05 (n = 30 using the data points in the figure as units of analysis). The obtained coefficients for each condition are summarized in Table 2.  From the analyses, we can confirm the significant coefficient of the time (x, x\u00b2) in the offline ratio of both the LAD and HAD conditions, indicating the improvement of the performance of the main goal over time. Contrary, concerning the subgoal performance (response time and its STD), we find the significant coefficient of the time in only the LAD condition. The results suggest that subgoal performance improves only under the LAD condition, not under the HAD condition.\nWe also examined the differences in the performance of the main and sub goals between conditions. In Table 2, coefficients of the intercepts for offline ratio are clearly different between the LAD and HAD conditions (0.0487 < 0.3328, respectively). From this difference, we can confirm the influence of the task difficulty on the main goal performance. In contrast, the difference in performance on the subgoal is not clear in the table, although from the middle and right panels of Fig. 2 we can observe the difference between the two conditions in the means and STDs of response time. To confirm these partial differences, we performed a paired t-test using the values at the data points in the figure as the unit of analysis (n = 30). For the middle of Fig. 2, we confirmed the difference between the average of the response time between the conditions (t(29) = 5.94, p<.01). We also confirmed similar differences in STDs presented in the right panel of Fig. 2. This suggests that the probe response in the HAD condition were generally delayed (the middle panel of Fig. 2). In particular, certain rounds by some participants in the HAD condition experienced significant delays in responding to the probe as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2.\nTo summarize, the characteristics of the time trends for each dataset are as follows:\nOffline ratio (main goal) in LAD: decreasing over time\nOffline ratio (main goal) in HAD: decreasing over time\nResponse time (subgoal) in LAD: decreasing over time\nResponse time (subgoal) in HAD: no statistically significant time trends\nAdditionally, we observed the following differences between conditions:\nOffline ratio (main goal): HAD > LAD\nResponse time (subgoal): HAD > LAD\nOur model aims to reproduce these characteristics of human data, particularly focusing on the probe response time as the subgoal indicator."}, {"title": "4 Model", "content": "The current study extended the previous model of arousal in the line following task [25,26] to perform the task in a multitasking situation.

Based on this basic idea,  illustrates task switching based on the activation dynamics for the main and the sub goals. Generally, the activation for the main goal is assumed to be higher than that of the subgoal because of the emphasis on the task instruction. However, when a stimulus related to the subgoal is presented, it is expected that the activation of the subgoal will temporarily increase and close to the activation of the main goal. When the activation of the subgoal exceeds the activation of the main goal, the chunk stored in the goal buffer is changed, and a response to the presented stimulus is made. Then, after the stimulus disappears, the activation of the subgoal decreases and returns to the main goal.\nThe above process can be represented by leveraging the basics of ACT-R subsymbolic computations. First, the activation (A) of chunki in ACT-R is calculated as the summation of multiple components.\n$A_i = B_i + S_i + E_i$\n The above equation only contains components used in the current study. $B_i$ is called base-level activation,"}, {"title": "4.2.2 Activation in High Arousal State", "content": "In this study, we regard the performance decline in high arousal as a lack of smooth transition of activity from the main goal to the subgoal. To represent the arousal dynamics that interfere with the allocation of attention to the subgoal, we redefined the activation equation by modifying equation 1 as follows.\n$A_i = r(t)(B_i + S_i) + E_i$\nThis new equation introduces a coefficient, r(t), that is applied to the activation of all chunks of the model (including both chunks representing the main and the sub goals). . The basic idea behind this is that a highly aroused situation makes memory access rapid and easy. The ACT-R's activation mechanism not only affects the selection of a chunk but also influences the access speed of the chunk. Highly activated chunks are retrieved fast, and if there are no chunks with enough activation, the model fails the memory retrieval after the predefined threshold time passed. Thus, we assume"}, {"title": "5 Simulation", "content": "The simulation in this study examines the behavior of the above models in settings that correspond to the LAD and HAD conditions in the human experiment. The model traces the course that participants followed in each condition for 30 min at the same speed as in the LAD condition (40 ms/frame). We also set two models manipulating the goal setting in equation 5 as follows.\nLow arousal demand model (mLAD): As with the LAD condition in the experiment, no feedback by score was given and the arousal level of the model was assumed to be fixed to a neutral state. That is, r(t) was fixed to 1 throughout the task. The acti-vation of the main goal and the subgoal remained computed by the default ACT-R setting.\nHigh arousal demand model (mHAD): The goal score is updated as in the human experiment. Since the model is in a situation where the goal score is constantly tracked, scoregoal fluctuates with the performance from round 2 onward. a is set so that the average of r(t) calculated by this fluctuation is greater than 1. In the initial round, however, r(t) is set to 1 because there is no goal score.\nIn addition to these settings, we set \u03c3 = 0.13, \u03b2\u2081 = 4, d = 0.5, and S = 16.84 as the ACT-R parameters for memory activation. The parameters of the motor module were set the same as those of the previous study [15], and the parameters of motor learning were also set the same as those of the other previous study [25]."}, {"title": "5.2 Result", "content": "With the above parameter sets, the consistency of the behavior between the model and the experiment was investigated.

Despite the consistency in the general decreasing trends with the human data, the value in the low arousal model is significantly lower than that in the corresponding human data. Those results suggest the benefit of the ACT-R motor learning mechanism [3] to simulate the improvement of the main goal performance, although the perceptual-motor cycle in ACT-R is indicated as slower than that in the human participants.\nContrary, the middle and right panels of Figs. 8 and 9 show the results relating the probe response time, which is the focus of this study. In generating these figures, we set the response time for unresponded probes to 50 sec, similar to the human data, and treated subsequent responses as missing data. As a result, the models with parameter 1 generated no missing data, while the model with parameter 2 generated one missing response for the mLAD model and 3,149 missing responses for the mHAD model. Thus, the mHAD model with parameter 2 failed to respond to more than half of the probes, and the almost half of the remaining probes were assigned the maximum response time of 50 sec."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This study aimed to develop a model of task immersion that leads to performance deficits caused by arousal dynamics. To achieve this goal, the ACT-R model of a multitasking environment was constructed following existing models of a perceptual-motor coordination task. Focusing on the overlooking subgoal-related stimuli, we set simulations under the low and high arousal demands (mLAD and mHAD) with different sets of parameters. The results showed a performance deficit in the subgoal due to the high arousal demand, similar to the corresponding human condition. Summarizing the results, our model successfully represents homeostatic regulations on arousal dynamics producing human compatible data.\nThe significance of this study is the integrated account of the relationship between arousal and task per-formance based on the activation theory. Concerning the relationship between arousal and performance, the optimal level theory [39] has been used as a general explanation. Consistent with this theory, our ACT-R model showed the performance deficit caused by high arousal demands. We consider that this implemented mechanism is consistent with the cue utilization theory [11], which explains the narrowing attentional focus with increased arousal.\nBased on the discussion so far, we claim that using cognitive architecture to predict human arousal dynamics is advantageous to develop an integrated theory. There are previous studies dealing with the performance decrease at low arousal level [26,25]. We believe that the results of the past studies will be integrated with those of the present study to provide a complete explanation of the organic arousal system."}, {"title": "6.2 Future Studies", "content": "Although the above mentioned success and implications, the current study has a lot of limitations leading further research.\nThe first one is in the human experiment, where participants were recruited using crowdsourcing. Due to the nature of online experiments, we could not obtain detailed data showing arousal dynamics caused by mismatches between actual and demanded arousal levels. Therefore, a lab experiment measuring physiological data, such as heart rate, is needed to validate the mechanism and the prediction of the model.\nA related limitation is the manipulation of arousal demands, as this study primarily focused on task difficulty, which directly influences task performance. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish deficits caused by high arousal from performance declines simply due to the difficulty. To demonstrate the advantage of including arousal dynamics, we need to compare it to multitasking models without this factor, such as [22].\nAnother important topic for future exploration is the representation of arousal. In the current research, we conceptualize arousal as an overall activation of the system based on its definition [11]. This assumption leads to the inclusion of explicit goal retrieval within the model (see Fig. 4). Although the retrievals of chunks in this study does not introduce a time delay in the overall process because it has high activation from the beginning, declarative processes of ACT-R are generally considered to be costly and are gradually bypassed through learning [19]. The current study does not address the mechanism of attention allocation after such learning, where the model's process is primarily driven by the production rule selection.\nThis limitation is also related to the probe confirmation process depicted in Fig. 4. In the current model, the probe is always detected as soon as it appears in the window. However, in deeply immersed situations, delays might occur before the probe information is stored in the goal buffer. To represent such delays, we could incorporate a mechanism of the selection between the confirm probe and the other productions relating to the main goal. In ACT-R, such a conflict resolution between production rules is modulated by a parameter called utility. However, ACT-R does not currently address the relationship between the subsymbolic parameter for the production module and that for the declarative module. Therefore, future research is needed to explore these subsymbolic processes in ACT-R in a consistent manner to represent whole picture of the optimal arousal theory.\nThe final line of future study is exploring parameter fitting. Both parameters in Table 3 didn't lead to enough matching. Parameter 1 that focused more on the main goal resulted in extremely high percentage of the missing response. Contrary, parameter 2 didn't reach at the same level of the response delay and deviation as the human data. These results suggest that the corresponding parameters for the human participants are somewhere between those parameter sets. In the future, we will adjust the parameter more precisely to explore the factors influencing arousal by instructions of the experiment."}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": "The accuracy of the perceptual-motor loop (Fig. 4) is improved by learning through the task.

They allow evaluation of general\nlinguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness\nand identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The\ncurrent packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires\ndomain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to\ndevelop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It\nclusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply\nprompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-\nknown Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral\ntest profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths\nof those models.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The advent of deep learning algorithms and transformer architectures has led to significant advances in the\nperformance of natural language processing (NLP) models. However, it is well known that complex models tend to\noverfit the training datasets and suffer from lack of generalizability. There are many challenges in real-world\napplications due to the dynamically varying nature of data ([2],[3]) diverse inputs, and sparse training data in some\napplications. This creates challenges in developing and implementing appropriate test suites to assess model\nperformance. Recently, stimulated by the behavioral testing paradigm in software engineering, researchers have\nproposed analogous methods for testing NLP models. For example, the paper CheckList ([1]) introduced Minimum\nFunctionality Test (MFT), which are simple test cases designed to test a specific behavior, for example testing the\nnegation, vocabulary, invariance towards the Named Entity recognition (NER) capability of the model. Negation MFTs\nare simple test cases in which negations are introduced in a single line of text to test whether the model understands\nnegations. These tests are constructed from a manually preset template, and they allow expansion to multiple tests\nfor detecting potential model weakness. However, a major limitation for this approach is that the template needs to\nbe designed manually. The process can be time and resource intensive as they must be developed for domain-specific\napplications. Further, the quality of the template varies with the subject-matter experts' knowledge, creativity, and\nlanguage skills. In addition, the overall semantic and syntactic diversity of the tests are restricted due to the fixed\nformat and structure of the base template. It is also possible that the generated test cases might have different data\ndistribution compared to the original dataset."}, {"title": "2 Experiments and Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Dataset and Model", "content": "We utilized the Amazon customer review dataset ([6], [7]) with negative and positive labels.

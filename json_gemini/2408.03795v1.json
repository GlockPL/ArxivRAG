He considered the notion important enough to devote a few pages to it in his introductory book [8] (pp. 35\u201337) the following year. It turns out that this so-called logical proportion is one of the possible (equivalent) expressions of a Boolean analogical proportion [10]. However, Piaget apparently never made the connection between his logical proportions and analogy.\nThis is the starting point of this short paper for proposing a new extension of analogical proportions to numerical values, based on triangular norms [4].\nThe paper is organized as follows.\n\u2022 Section 2 recalls the link between Piaget's logical proportions and Boolean analogical proportions.\n\u2022 Section 3 presents a new way of extending analogical proportions to numerical data using a pair of dual trian-gular norm and co-norm in place of conjunction and disjunction connectives in Piaget's logical proportions. This preserves the expected properties of analogical proportions. Moreover the Frank's family of triangular norms and co-norms [3] seems especially appropriate, since it preserves an additional desirable property.\n\u2022 Section 4 examines the differences and potential links with an interesting recent proposal based on a param-eterized family of means, also for extending analogical proportions to numerical values."}, {"title": "2 Piaget's logical proportion and analogy", "content": "Let a, b, c, d denote four logical propositions. Then a, b, c, d make a logical proportion in the sense of Piaget [7, 8] if the two following conditions hold\n$a \\wedge d = b \\wedge c$ and $a \\vee d = b \\vee c$.\nAn analogical proportion is a statement involving four items, usually denoted a : b :: c:d, which reads \u201ca is to b as c is to d\". When a, b, c, d are propositional truth values, the two conditions underlying Piaget's logical proportions define the following quaternary connective\n$Pia(a, b, c, d) = ((a \\wedge d) = (b \\wedge c)) \\wedge ((a \\vee d) = (b \\vee c)) = ((a \\wedge d) = (b \\wedge c)) \\wedge ((\\neg a \\wedge \\neg d) = (\\neg b \\wedge \\neg c))$\nThis connective when it is true emphasizes similarity and can be read as \"what a and d have in common (positively or negatively), b and c have it also\". It also says that \"when a and d differs (one is true, the other is false) then b and c also differ\".\nPia(a, b, c, d) is true only for the 6 patterns exhibited in the table below (and thus false for the 24 \u2212 6 = 10 remaining patterns).\nThe above logical expression is known to be one of the expressions of a Boolean analogical proportion [6]. Another equivalent expression emphasizes dissimilarity inside pairs (a, b) and (c, d). Namely we have :\n$a : b :: c : d = ((a \\wedge \\neg b) = (c \\wedge \\neg d)) \\wedge ((\\neg a \\wedge b) = (\\neg c \\wedge d))) \\text{(1)}$\nIt precisely expresses that \u201ca differs from b as c differs from d and b differs from a as d differs from c\" (and \"when a and b do not differ, c and d do not differ\"). Thus we also have\n$a : b :: c : d = Pia(a, b, c, d) = ((a \\wedge d) = (b \\wedge c)) \\wedge ((a \\vee d) = (b \\vee c)) \\text{(2)}$\nIt can be easily checked that a : b :: c : d satisfies the postulates usually assumed for analogical expressions: -\n\u2022 reflexivity: a:b:a: b;\n\u2022 symmetry: a : b :: c : d \u21d2 c : d :: a : b ;\n\u2022 stability under central permutation: a : b :: c : d \u21d2 a : c :: b : d.\nAs a consequence, an analogical proportion also satisfies\n\u2022 a:a :: b : b (sameness);\n\u2022 a : b :: c : d\u21d2 d : b :: c : a (external permutation);\n\u2022 a : b :: c:d \u21d2 b : a :: d : c (internal reversal);\n\u2022 a : b :: c : d \u21d2 d : c :: b : a (complete reversal).\nNote that reflexivity postulate a:b:a:b, true for all a a d b, forces a Boolean analogical proportion to be true for the valuations (0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 0), and (1,1,1,1). The minimal Boolean model that satisfies the three above postulates is true for the 6 patterns for Boolean variables a, b, c, d exhibited in the above table [11].\nBesides it can be checked that Boolean analogical proportions are transitive:\n$(a : b :: c : d) \\wedge (c : d :: e : f) \\Rightarrow a : b :: e : f$.\nAnalogical proportions have been extended to numerical values a, b, c, d (assumed to be normalized between 0 and 1) by starting from (1) or (2) and by replacing connectives A, V, \u00ac, = by multiple-valued connectives, the choice of these"}, {"title": "3 A triangular norm-based definition of an analogical proportion", "content": "Triangular norms are associative operations of the unit interval [12], which have been extensively studied in fuzzy set theory [4], triangular norms being the proper operations for defining fuzzy set intersections, and their dual co-norms for defining fuzzy set unions. We start with a brief refresher on triangular norms, before introducing them in a new definition of analogical proportions for numerical values.\n3.1 A brief refresher on triangular norms\nTriangular norms (t-norms for short) and triangular conorms (t-conorms for short) were invented by Schweizer and Sklar [12, 4], in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces, for the purpose of expressing the triangular inequality. They also turn out to the most general binary operations on [0, 1] that meet natural and intuitive requirements for conjunction and disjunction operations. Namely, a t-norm T is a binary operation on [0, 1], i.e., T : [0, 1] \u00d7 : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], that satisfies the following conditions:\n\u2022 commutative: T(a, b) = T(b,a);\n\u2022 associative: T(a,T(b, c)) = T(T(a, b), c);\n\u2022 non-decreasing in both arguments: T(a, b) \u2264 T(a', b') if a \u2264 a' and b < b';\n\u2022 boundary conditions: T(a, 1) = T(1, a) = a.\nIt can be proved that T(a, 0) = T(0, a) = 0. It is known that the minimum operation is the greatest t-norm, i.e., for any t-norm T, T(a, b) \u2264 min(a, b) holds for all a, b \u2208 [0, 1]. Typical basic examples of t-norms are\n\u2022 the minimum : T(a, b) = min(a, b),\n\u2022 the product: T(a, b) = a \u00b7 b,\n\u2022 the linear (or \u0141ukasiewicz) t-norm: T(a, b) = max(0, a + b \u2212 1).\nNote the inequalities: max(0, a + b \u2212 1) \u2264 a \u00b7 b \u2264 min(a, b).\nThese three cases are important since any continuous t-norm is definable as an ordinal sum\u00b9 of copies of \u0141ukasiewicz, minimum and product t-norms (see, e.g,. [4]).\nIn the following, we only consider continuous t-norms. A t-norm is said to be Archimedian if \u2200a, 0 < a < 1, T(a, a) < a. Any continuous Archimedian t-norm has an additive generator f, and can be written as $T(a,b) = f^{(-1)}(f(a) + f(b))$ where f is a strictly decreasing function from [0, 1] to [0, +\u221e) and $f^{(-1)}$ is its pseudo-inverse defined by\n$f^{(-1)}(x) = 1$ if $x \\in [0, f(1)]$, $f^{(-1)} = f^{-1}(x)$ if $x \\in [f(1), f(0)]$, $f^{(-1)} = 0$ if $x \\in [f(0), +\\infty)$. If f is such that f(1) = 0 and $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = +\\infty$, the t-norm is said to be strict. The product is a typical example of strict t-norm (for which f(x) = \u2212ln(x)). When T is strict, $f^{(-1)}(x) = f^{-1}(x)$. If f(1) = 0 and f(0) is finite, the t-norm is said to be nilpotent; the \u0141ukasiewicz) t-norm is a typical example (f(x) = 1 \u2212 x).\nThe De Morgan-like dual notion of a t-norm (w.r.t. negation n(a) = 1 \u2212 a, or a more general strong negation) is that of a t-conorm S(a, b) = n(T(n(a), n(b))) (a strong negation is such that n(0) = 1; n(1) = 0; n(a) \u2265 n(b), if a < b, and n(n(a)) = a; in the following we use n(a) = 1 \u2212 a, for all a \u2208 [0,1]).\nThus, a binary operation S on [0, 1] is called a t-conorm if it satisfies the same properties as the ones of a t-norm except for the boundary conditions, namely, here 0 is an identity and 1 is absorbent:\nboundary conditions: S(0, a) = S(a, 0) = a."}, {"title": "3.2 Definition and properties", "content": "Definition 1 Let a, b, c, d be four numerical values in [0, 1]. a, b, c, d are said to satisfy an analogical proportion based on the t-norm T (and its dual t-conorm ST), which is denoted \u0410T(a, b, c, d), if and only if T(a,d) = T(b, c) and ST(a,d) = ST(b, c)).\nNote that this definition is all-or-nothing: \u0410T(a, b, c, d) is true or false. This contrasts with the multiple-valued logic extensions of a:b:: c:d, where the multiple-valued quaternary connective obtained becomes a matter of degree when a, b, c, d are numerical values [2]. Definition 1 might be weakened by requiring only equality for T (or for ST), but in the following we keep it as it is for symmetry reason.\nIt is easy to check that\n\u2022 when a, b, c, d \u2208 {0,1}, \u0410T(a, b, c, d) is true only for the 6 valuations of the table in Section 2 that make a:b:: c:d true.\n\u2022 \u0410T(a, b, c, d) satisfies the three postulates of analogical proportions: i) reflexivity, ii) symmetry, and iii) stability under central permutation, thanks to the commutativity of T (and thus of ST). It is clear that \u0410T(a, b, c, d) also satisfies the consequences of the three postulates.\nExample 1 Let us consider the examples of the three main t\u2013norms.\n\u2022 T(a,b) = min(a, b) and ST(a,b) = max(a,b). Then \u0410T(a, b, c, d) means min(a,d) = min(b, c) and max(a, d) = max(b, c). So \u0410T(a, b, c, d) holds only if a = b (resp. a = c) and then c = d (resp. (b = d).\n\u2022 T(a,b) = ab and ST(a,b) = a + b \u2212 ab. Then \u0410T(a, b, c, d) means ad = bc and a + d \u2013 ad = b + c \u2212 bc, which is equivalent to ad = bc and a + d = b + c. Thus, a,b, c, d form both an arithmetic proportion (i.e., a \u2212 b = c \u2212 d), and a geometric proportion (i.e., $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}$provided that b \u2260 0 and d \u2260 0). In the case a = 0, this imposes b or c to be 0 as well. In case b = 0, then d = c, if c = 0, then d = b. This leads to the only candidate proportions \u0410T(0,0, c, c) and \u0410T(0, b, 0, b). More generally, letting a + d = S and ad = P, we obtain the equation a\u00b2 \u2013 Sa + P which has two solutions a = b (and then c = d) and a = c (and then b = d).\n\u2022 T(a, b) = max(0, a + b \u2212 1) and ST(a,b) = min(1, a + b). Then \u0410T(a, b, c, d) means max(0, a + d \u2212 1) = max(0, b + c - 1) and min(1, a + d) = min(1, b + c), i. e., a + d = b + c, or if we prefer a \u2013 b = c - d.\nThus, we obtain two different views of an analogical proportion between numerical values:\n\u2022 a conservative view with T equal to minimum or product, where the only accepted analogical proportions are of the form a:a::c:cora : b :: a: b.\n\u2022 a liberal view with T equal to \u0141ukasiewicz) t-norm where a : b :: c : d holds if and only if a - b = c - d.\nThese two options corresponds to the cases where the two multiple-valued logic extensions of a : b :: c: d [2] are equal to 1 respectively. It is clear that the conservative view is much more drastic than the liberal one.\nBesides, it is clear that Ar (a, b, c, d) is transitive (i.e.,\u0410T(a, b, c, d), \u0410T(c, d, g, h) \u21d2 \u0410T(a,b,g, h)) when T is one of the three main triangular norms. But the property is more general. For instance, when T is strict, using its additive generator, we have f(a)+ f(d) = f(b) + f (c) and f(c)+f(h) = f(d) + f (g) that entails f (a) + f(h) = f(b)+f(g), and similarly for the dual co-norm equality."}, {"title": "3.3 Appropriateness of Frank's triangular norms", "content": "There exist several parameterized families of triangular norms [4].

Moreover, it is established [5] that given a < b < c < d, \u2203!r such that Mr(a,d) = Mr(b, c).\nThere seems to be an obvious parallel between Definition 1 and Definition 2, up to the point that the conditions are respectively stated in terms of t-norms and dual t-conorms on the one hand and in terms of mean on the other hand. The two definitions coincides if T is the \u0141ukasiewicz t-norm and Mp = M1. Definition 1 is closer to logic and to multiple-valued logic extensions of analogical proportion [2] than Definition 2 that uses means which are not multiple-valued logic operations strictly speaking.\nThe use of the parameterized family of Frank's t-norms enables us to modulate the conditions defining Arp (a, b, c, d); we may wonder if when 0 < a < b < c \u2264 d \u2264 1, \u2203p such that Arp (a, b, c, d) holds. This is an open question. At least we know that the solution may not be unique, since, e.g., Arp (0.5, 0.5,, 0.7, 0.7) holds for p = 0, 1, +\u221e, (i.e., for T = min, product, and \u0141ukasiewicz) t-norm.\nBesides, a long time ago, a multiple-valued logic extension of (1) based on Goguen's implication (a \u2192 b = 1 if a = 0 and a \u2192 b = min(1,b/a) otherwise) was proposed [6] which is equal to 1 if and only if ad = bc, thus coinciding with Definition 2 for Mo.

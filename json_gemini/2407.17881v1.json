Van de Ven\nand Poole describe business processes as teleological, i.e. directed towards a goal,\ncharacterized by planning and organizational problem-solving, with an envisioned\nend state that is reached by purposeful cooperation [33]. In contrast, lifecycle\nprocesses exhibit organic growth or decay, driven by a pre-configured program\nor natural rules. Events progress along a sequence of prescribed stages that are\noften irreversible [33].\nThe essential concepts of lifecycle processes are illustrated in Fig. 1. We define\na lifecycle process with reference to a focal entity, related events, and vital signs:\nDefinition 1. A lifecycle process is the sequence of events and observations of\nvital signs associated with a focal entity over the entire period or a relevant\nsub-period of its existence.\nWith respect to the lifecycle process of a person, we observe the characteristics\ndescribed above. This lifecycle process lets us expect some sort of organic growth\nand later decay, driven by the rules of our natural existence, partially in an\nirreversible way. However, we are not left to the natural rules of growth and decay\nalone. Various industries, engineering, and research domains develop processes to\nkeep an entity in a desired condition. Examples of repetitive process structures\nthat stabilize the conditions of an entity are treatment processes to handle\nthe health conditions of a patient, maintenance processes that keep an engine\noperational, or fertilizing processes that foster the capacity of a field to grow\ncrops. Here, we refer to such processes as vitalizing processes, defined as follows:"}, {"title": "Definition 2.", "content": "A vitalizing process is a continuous work process that aims to\nfoster or stabilize the condition of at least one entity with a natural tendency\nto stagnate or deteriorate. Here, the condition of the entity is described through\none or more vital signs that provide a proxy for the current state of the entity.\nVitalizing processes have the goal of keeping the entity in the desired condition.\nWe describe three examples of lifecycle and corresponding vitalizing processes.\n1. Chronic Disease Treatment is a healthcare process focused on one patient\nas an entity [21]. A patient visit to a medical specialist is one of several\nvitalizing processes to ensure stable health. Vital signs like blood sugar level\nor events having contracted pneumonia require actions to be taken.\nThe lifecycle process is the development of the patient over time. A practical\ngoal here is to stabilize the patient's condition. A modeling goal is to describe\nwhich conditions should be treated with which actions. An analysis goal is\nto understand which actions are most effective for which condition.\n2. Farming is a process that has been performed by humans since millennia [10].\nA field is an entity managed to extract a certain crop over an undefined\nnumber of seasons. Activities performed by the farmer, such as watering\nor fertilizing, are vitalizing processes, which are motors to ensure optimal\nconditions for crop growth. The type and amount of actions a farmer performs\non the land depend on the state of the soil. Vital signs like the level of nitrate,\nor events like a flooding of the field, require certain actions to be taken.\nThe lifecycle process is the development of the field over time. A practical\ngoal in this context is to improve the condition of growing crops on the field.\nA modeling goal is to identify relevant steps and when they should happen\nin the season, potentially considering environmental conditions. An analysis\ngoal is to identify which process steps are most beneficial for future seasons,\npotentially considering crop order.\n3. Continuous integration is a process of enhancing the functionality of\na software system as an entity. Different vitalizing processes serve quality\nassurance, such as testing, issue management, or bug fixing, together with\ncycles of incremental extensions according to agile principles [4]. Vital signs\nare numbers of fixed bugs or reported issues; events like vulnerability reports\ntrigger hotfixes to the software system.\nThe lifecycle process is the development of the software system over time. A\npractical goal in this context is to add new features to the system. A modeling\ngoal is to identify relevant development and quality assurance steps and when\nthey should happen. An analysis goal is to assess how certain activities, such\nas reducing technical debt, lead to changes in the productivity of sprints."}, {"title": "2.2 Challenges for Classical BPM Analysis Techniques", "content": "Applying classical BPM analysis techniques for modeling and analyzing the de-\nscribed processes has several issues. A key question for applying many techniques\nis how to define a case. This comes with commitments to a conceptual window"}, {"title": "3 Modeling Lifecycle and Vitalizing Processes", "content": "In this section, we propose a conceptual model for lifecycle processes, vitalizing\nprocesses, and their relationships. Figure 2 presents this model as a class diagram.\nWe first discuss the type level, then the instance level. At the type level, we\ndistinguish the entity type and its lifecycle process, potentially multiple motor\ntypes and multiple vitalizing processes:\nEntity Type. An entity type is a category of entities that share common\nproperties. An entity type has a lifecycle process and several motor types. Patient\nis an entity type.\nLifecycle Process. Each entity type has a lifecycle process that captures its\ntypical evolution. Multiple vitalizing processes can contribute to this evolution.\nA patient has a typical lifecycle.\nMotor Type. Each entity type has several motor types that can stabilize or\npotentially drive its growth or decay. Motor types represent the rules of nature to\nwhich an entity type is subject. Examples are the immune reaction of a patient as\na stabilizing motor of the current state, puberty as a progressing motor towards\na higher level of capabilities, and diseases as deteriorating motors.\nVitalizing Process. A vitalizing process is an active intervention targeting the\nlifecycle process of an entity type. A therapy that can serve as a vitalizing process\nfor a patient. Vitalizing processes typically strengthen stabilizing or progressing\nmotor types or work against the effects of deteriorating motors."}, {"title": "4 Analysis of Lifecycle and Vitalizing Processes", "content": "This section discusses the requirements for analysis techniques to obtain insights\nfrom lifecycle and vitalizing processes. Therefore, Section 4.1 assesses related\nwork from BPM research, partly supporting the lifecycle process analysis. Then,\nwe identify a deduced set of requirements from the use cases and related work for\nthe analysis of lifecycle and vitalizing processes in Section 4.2 Finally, we discuss\nhow techniques from neighboring research areas might fill gaps and provide an\noverall discussion on what requirements are supported or not by the previously\npresented related work in Section 4.3."}, {"title": "4.1 Related BPM Analysis Techniques", "content": "There are three main streams of BPM research that relate to lifecycle and\nvitalizing processes: i) approaches that address continuous cyclic structures;\nii) data-centric approaches; and iii) time-series related approaches.\nIn the stream of research that tackles continuous cyclic processes, Combi et\nal. [5] present a proposal for modeling chronic patient treatment with existing\nBPMN notation elements. The authors highlight the need for a repeating process\nto stabilize a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patient and\ncapture it as a loop subprocess. The process can also be interrupted in case of\nunforeseen needs. Additionally, in case of exacerbation, further activities can be\nexecuted in parallel to it. This leads to a complex, multi-level process model.\nStrutzenberger et al. [30] extend BPMN to model continuous processes, for\ninstance, beer brewing, by regularly adding ingredients to a brewing process.\nIn their work, continuous processes are characterized by a closed loop, having\nsteady inlet and outlet flows as well as temporally stable conditions. This research\nhighlights that activities in continuous processes must be executed for a particular\ntime span to provide high-end quality. For instance, the deterioration of the\nreactor over time implies lower-quality beer, but the brewing ingredients and\nsteps remain the same. Finally, the issue of repeating process behavior also\nexists in software engineering when the development process is modelled [24,20].\nOverarching methodologies with repeating behavior, such as SCRUM, have been\nmodeled using BPMN [37].\nIn the stream of data-centric approaches, the entity, its associated data\nand characteristics, and its changing states is in the center of process modeling,\nanalysis and automation [29]. Such approaches provide means to store information\non entities structurally as artifacts, objects, or tuples [29]. For example, the\nartifact-centric approach [18] considers an entity's information model, including\nthe attributes, and an entity's lifecycle describing the order of its allowed states.\nNevertheless, data-centric approaches provide no explicit means to represent the\nrepetitive behavior of cases.\nIn the stream of time-series-related approaches in the BPM area, several\nworks exists that combine time-series data and event data or process models.\nDunk et al. [9] consider combining process event logs with time-series data. The\nobjective is to use the time series associated with the activities of the process in"}, {"title": "4.2\nRequirement for Analysis Techniques", "content": "The data of lifecycle and vitalizing processes exhibits characteristics that are\ndifferent from classical business processes. Here, we describe requirements that\nappropriate analysis techniques have to address. The requirements R1 to R5 are\nretrieved from the issues addressed by related work, and R6 to R7 are derived\nfrom the phenomena of an entity discussed in the use cases of the previous section.\nR1: Absence of specific end state. We observe that classical business processes\nare defined with a clear direction towards a desired end [36,18]. Therefore, how\nto reach efficiently and accurately this end is a pillar for many BPM techniques.\nThe problem is that lifecycle processes often do not target one specific desired\noutcome [30]. Rather, the objective of many vitalizing processes is stabilizing or\nfostering certain conditions of an entity. For example, in healthcare, the death\nof a patient is avoided by the medical specialists as a factual end. Accordingly,\nwe require techniques for lifecycle processes that are able to analyze processes\nthat lack a particular end state. Techniques for vitalizing processes must be able\nto analyze how their different runs impact the entity and, additionally, enable a\ncomparison of them.\nR2: Recurring behaviour. We observe that classical BPM techniques assume\na teleological process from a defined start to a desired end [36]. Often, this idea\nis already encoded in the name of the business process, as with order-to-cash,\nprocure-to-pay, and lead-to-close processes [8]. Recurring behavior can occur\nwithin a process execution and needs special attention in the representation, e.g.,\nthe iteration workflow patterns [26]. Recurring behavior is often classified as\nwaste in the process analysis [8]. The problem is that vitalizing processes are\noften enacted repeatedly over the lifecycle of an entity [5]. This is not a matter of\nwaste, but a key feature. Accordingly, we require analysis techniques for lifecycle\nprocesses that are able to consider recurring behavior. Furthermore, they must\nbe able to incorporate the idea that vitalizing processes might differ, overlap,\nand depend on each other.\nR3: Temporal Regularity of Processes. We observe that classical business\nprocesses are often expected to be completed as fast as possible [8]. That is\nwhy many BPM methods are focused on remaining time [34] or waiting time\nprediction [27]. The problem is that lifecycle processes are often expected to"}, {"title": "Unraveling the Never-Ending Story of Lifecycles and Vitalizing Processes", "content": "endure as long as possible. A short cycle time is indeed not desired. Vitalizing\nprocesses are often naturally scheduled at a specific time [5]. Consider a farming\nprocess where the calendar dictates certain activities to be performed. Therefore,\nthe remaining time of a vitalizing process is often known and not a goal for\noptimization. Accordingly, we require techniques for vitalizing processes that are\nable to consider the temporal regularity of processes beyond cycle time.\nR4: Handling Multi-facet Data. We observe that event logs can only capture\nchanges of attribute values by representing them as new events [16]. This leads to a\nproblem that lifecycle processes of an entity, such as a patient, are characterized by\ntheir continuously changing vital signs [9], for instance, to determine if vitalizing\nactions need to be taken. This might be actively captured, e.g., by a smartwatch\nwith different sensors. We require measures to analyze vital signs over time at\nvarying observation interval density. While the action on an entity might be\nrepresented in events, the information of vital signs is best represented as time\nseries data [12]. Thus, we require techniques for lifecycle and vitalizing processes\nto handle multi-facet data consisting of different types.\nR5: Lifecycle of an Entity. We observe that classical BPM techniques focus\non the quality of the process output of each process case in isolation [8]. This is\na problem because vitalizing processes are executed to archive a stabilization or\nprogression of one or multiple entities. The development over the whole lifecycle\nprocess is often more relevant than the results of a single execution of a vitalizing\nprocess. Therefore, we require process analysis techniques for lifecycle processes\nthat capture changes in the entity and the trend of its development.\nR6: State of an Entity. We observe that classical BPM assumes that each case\nof a business process has an independent existence. They are executed without\nreference to each other [26]. This is a problem because a vitalizing case needs\ninformation about the current state of the entity and the effects of previous\nvitalizing cases. Thus, a the current state of the entity must be accessible for the\nvitalizing case. Accordingly, we require to be able to specify the relevant states\nand to track them. The lifecycle process and the vitalizing process must be able\nto read vital signs that serve as a proxy for the current state of the entity.\nR7: Motor as Natural Trend of an Entity. We observe that classical\nBPM does not consider the natural trend (i.e., the pre-configured program of\nnatural rules) of an entity or its environment. This is a problem because lifecycle\nprocesses are naturally driven by motors associated with the entity. A patient\nmight, for instance, have a disease as a deteriorating motor, which sometimes\ncan be stabilized but not always be stopped. Comparing the actual change of the\nentity with its expected natural trend might give insights into the effectiveness\nof a vitalizing process. Accordingly, we require means to capture the natural\ntrend of an entity, including the expected effects on the vital signs describing\nthat entity."}, {"title": "4.3 Other related Techniques and Discussion of Coverage", "content": "Based on our requirements analysis, we want to discuss how existing areas\nof research can contribute to the development of new analysis techniques for\nlifecycle-related processes. We identified three areas of research that provide us\nwith essential components for future analysis techniques: (i) time series analysis,\n(ii) social sequence analysis, and (iii) mortality analysis.\nTime Series Analysis. The research area of time series [11] is concerned with\nextracting useful information, such as patterns, from time series data. Typical\nanalysis tasks in this area include forecasting time series, clustering similar time\nseries, segmenting a time series, and anomaly detection. However, the most\nrelevant is the area of motif discovery [31], identifying frequent unknown patterns\nwith time series. Future techniques for lifecycle-related processes can build on\nmotif discovery and try to link discovered motifs from the vital signs with events\nor states from the event/state sequences. Furthermore, time series techniques\ncould be applied to vital signs to provide helpful information about the vital\nsigns that could be used to inform actions with vitalizing processes. One specific\ntechnique in this context is change point detection. This technique detects the\npoint in time when change occurs [15], making it an integral part of concept drift\nanalysis. Overall, it can be said that existing techniques from time series analysis\nprovide a substantial component for lifecycle-related processes by helping to\nutilize hidden information from vital signs.\nSocial Sequence Analysis. Social sequence analysis [2,6] is concerned with\ntracing social phenomena over time. The input data is typically defined as a\nsequence of states [14]. Critical design decisions are related to the granularity of\nthe time intervals at which state sequences are captured. Typical analysis tasks for\nstate sequences include describing stochastic patterns, analyzing homogeneity and\nstationarity, optimal matching, or sequence network construction [6]. Specifically\ninteresting for analyzing the lifecycle process is stationarity analysis. If a sequence\nis stationary, then the probability to transition from, e.g., state A to B is the\nsame, no matter in which segment it occurs. Understanding such properties might\nprovide indications of recurring behavior, temporal regularity, and the impact of\nmotors on the lifecycle of an entity. Social sequence analysis also offers various\ntechniques for visualizing, sorting, and clustering cohorts of sequences, as well\nas measures of complexity and turbulence [14]. Overall, techniques from social\nsequence analysis address the requirements of the lifecycle process well because\nof their assumption that there is no clear start or end.\nMortality Analysis. Mortality analysis studies the causes of death in popu-\nlations [22]. This requires various methodologies and approaches to understand\nmortality rates, life expectancy, and factors influencing death. There are four\nmain types of mortality analysis. First, descriptive mortality analysis involves\nstudying death rates, causes of death, and their distribution among different\npopulations, regions, or time periods. Second, life table analysis helps analyze\nmortality rates across different age groups, providing insights into life expectancy\nand survival probabilities. Third, cause-specific mortality analysis examines the"}, {"title": "Unraveling the Never-Ending Story of Lifecycles and Vitalizing Processes", "content": "causes of death within a population to understand disease burdens and health\npriorities. Fourth, f compares mortality rates across different demographic groups,\nsocio-economic classes, or geographic regions to identify disparities and underly-\ning factors.\nMortality analysis has also seen broader applications such as in finance [3], forest\nresearch [17], and even history [28]. Future lifecycle-related techniques can draw\ninspiration from mortality analysis in multiple ways. The four types of mortality\nanalysis can be applied to the lifecycle history. To this end, events of lifecycle pro-\ncesses will need to be gathered and analyzed. Consequently, vitalizing processes\ncan be redesigned to counter the discovered issues.\nOverall Comparision. In Table 1, we highlight what requirements of lifecycle\nand vitalizing processes are fulfilled by existing techniques and neighboring\nresearch areas. We can observe that most BPM techniques are only focused on\nspecific sub-problems of lifecycle-related business processes. As an example, the\nidea of repeating behavior, as presented in vitalizing cases, is discussed in several\npapers [5,30]. Similarly, several papers [9,13] try to integrate time series, as in\nthe form of vital signs, into BPM techniques. In future work, it will be possible\nto integrate the results from such research into techniques that address lifecycle\nand vitalizing processes.\nFurthermore, we can observe that many requirements for lifecycle and vitaliz-\ning processes have been addressed in other research fields such as time-series,\nsocial-sequence and mortality analysis (rows 6-8). Notably, these research fields\nare usually not concerned with the data fusion necessary to address lifecycle and\nvitalizing business processes. Nonetheless, we can highlight that they support\nmany of the aspects necessary for analysis technique of lifecycle-related processes\nand therefore can serve as valuable building blocks for novel approaches.\nOverall, we can argue that many approaches specialized on specific aspects of\nlifecycle and vitalizing processes exist. Therefore, we believe that this phenomenon"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we showed that traditional BPM techniques predominantly address\nteleological business processes with defined start and end states, e.g., purchase-\nto-pay processes. This research highlighted the existence of lifecycle process of a\nfocal entity, such as a patient, displaying either a natural increase or diminution.\nThey are supported by vitalizing processes that foster or stabilize the lifecycle\nprocess. We provided a conceptual model with the key ingredients of a lifecycle\nprocess and a data model. We discussed the requirements of analysis techniques\nfor lifecycle and vitalizing processes and showed that previous research work only\ncovered parts of them. We have come to the conclusion that many specialized\naspects of lifecycle and vitalizing processes are already supported by existing\nresearch. This existing research can serve as a foundation for analysis techniques\ntargeted towards lifecycle processes.\nThis paper is centered on identifying and conceptualizing the problem space\nwithout offering direct solutions. We envision this groundwork as a catalyst for a\nnew line of research within BPM. In the future, we plan to develop appropriate\nanalysis techniques for lifecycle and their vitalizing processes and plan to apply\nthem to real-world data. Furthermore, an important next step for the research\nlies in the collection of data from the lifecycle and vitalizing business processes."}]}

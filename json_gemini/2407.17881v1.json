Van de Ven\nand Poole describe business processes as teleological, i.e. directed towards a goal,\ncharacterized by planning and organizational problem-solving, with an envisioned\nend state that is reached by purposeful cooperation [33]. In contrast, lifecycle\nprocesses exhibit organic growth or decay, driven by a pre-configured program\nor natural rules. Events progress along a sequence of prescribed stages that are\noften irreversible [33].\nDefinition 1. A lifecycle process is the sequence of events and observations of\nvital signs associated with a focal entity over the entire period or a relevant\nsub-period of its existence.\nWith respect to the lifecycle process of a person, we observe the characteristics\ndescribed above. This lifecycle process lets us expect some sort of organic growth\nand later decay, driven by the rules of our natural existence, partially in an\nirreversible way. However, we are not left to the natural rules of growth and decay\nalone. Various industries, engineering, and research domains develop processes to\nkeep an entity in a desired condition. Examples of repetitive process structures\nthat stabilize the conditions of an entity are treatment processes to handle\nthe health conditions of a patient, maintenance processes that keep an engine\noperational, or fertilizing processes that foster the capacity of a field to grow\ncrops. Here, we refer to such processes as vitalizing processes, defined as follows:"}, {"title": "2.2 Challenges for Classical BPM Analysis Techniques", "content": "Applying classical BPM analysis techniques for modeling and analyzing the de-\nscribed processes has several issues.

Figure 2 presents this model as a class diagram.\nWe first discuss the type level, then the instance level. At the type level, we\ndistinguish the entity type and its lifecycle process, potentially multiple motor\ntypes and multiple vitalizing processes:\nEntity Type. An entity type is a category of entities that share common\nproperties. An entity type has a lifecycle process and several motor types. Patient\nis an entity type.\nLifecycle Process. Each entity type has a lifecycle process that captures its\ntypical evolution. Multiple vitalizing processes can contribute to this evolution.\nA patient has a typical lifecycle.\nMotor Type. Each entity type has several motor types that can stabilize or\npotentially drive its growth or decay. Motor types represent the rules of nature to\nwhich an entity type is subject. Examples are the immune reaction of a patient as\na stabilizing motor of the current state, puberty as a progressing motor towards\na higher level of capabilities, and diseases as deteriorating motors.\nVitalizing Process. A vitalizing process is an active intervention targeting the\nlifecycle process of an entity type. A therapy that can serve as a vitalizing process\nfor a patient. Vitalizing processes typically strengthen stabilizing or progressing\nmotor types or work against the effects of deteriorating motors."}, {"title": "4 Analysis of Lifecycle and Vitalizing Processes", "content": "This section discusses the requirements for analysis techniques to obtain insights\nfrom lifecycle and vitalizing processes. Therefore, Section 4.1 assesses related\nwork from BPM research, partly supporting the lifecycle process analysis. Then,\nwe identify a deduced set of requirements from the use cases and related work for\nthe analysis of lifecycle and vitalizing processes in Section 4.2 Finally, we discuss\nhow techniques from neighboring research areas might fill gaps and provide an\noverall discussion on what requirements are supported or not by the previously\npresented related work in Section 4.3."}, {"title": "4.1 Related BPM Analysis Techniques", "content": "There are three main streams of BPM research that relate to lifecycle and\nvitalizing processes: i) approaches that address continuous cyclic structures;\nii) data-centric approaches; and iii) time-series related approaches.\nIn the stream of research that tackles continuous cyclic processes, Combi et\nal. [5] present a proposal for modeling chronic patient treatment with existing\nBPMN notation elements. The authors highlight the need for a repeating process\nto stabilize a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patient and\ncapture it as a loop subprocess. The process can also be interrupted in case of\nunforeseen needs. Additionally, in case of exacerbation, further activities can be\nexecuted in parallel to it. This leads to a complex, multi-level process model.\nStrutzenberger et al. [30] extend BPMN to model continuous processes, for\ninstance, beer brewing, by regularly adding ingredients to a brewing process.\nIn their work, continuous processes are characterized by a closed loop, having\nsteady inlet and outlet flows as well as temporally stable conditions. This research\nhighlights that activities in continuous processes must be executed for a particular\ntime span to provide high-end quality. For instance, the deterioration of the\nreactor over time implies lower-quality beer, but the brewing ingredients and\nsteps remain the same. Finally, the issue of repeating process behavior also\nexists in software engineering when the development process is modelled [24,20].\nOverarching methodologies with repeating behavior, such as SCRUM, have been\nmodeled using BPMN [37].\nIn the stream of data-centric approaches, the entity, its associated data\nand characteristics, and its changing states is in the center of process modeling,\nanalysis and automation [29]. Such approaches provide means to store information\non entities structurally as artifacts, objects, or tuples [29]. For example, the\nartifact-centric approach [18] considers an entity's information model, including\nthe attributes, and an entity's lifecycle describing the order of its allowed states.\nNevertheless, data-centric approaches provide no explicit means to represent the\nrepetitive behavior of cases.\nIn the stream of time-series-related approaches in the BPM area, several\nworks exists that combine time-series data and event data or process models.\nDunk et al. [9] consider combining process event logs with time-series data. The\nobjective is to use the time series associated with the activities of the process in"}, {"title": "4.2 Requirement for Analysis Techniques", "content": "The data of lifecycle and vitalizing processes exhibits characteristics that are\ndifferent from classical business processes. Here, we describe requirements that\nappropriate analysis techniques have to address. The requirements R1 to R5 are\nretrieved from the issues addressed by related work, and R6 to R7 are derived\nfrom the phenomena of an entity discussed in the use cases of the previous section.\nR1: Absence of specific end state. We observe that classical business processes\nare defined with a clear direction towards a desired end [36,18]. Therefore, how\nto reach efficiently and accurately this end is a pillar for many BPM techniques.\nThe problem is that lifecycle processes often do not target one specific desired\noutcome [30]. Rather, the objective of many vitalizing processes is stabilizing or\nfostering certain conditions of an entity. For example, in healthcare, the death\nof a patient is avoided by the medical specialists as a factual end. Accordingly,\nwe require techniques for lifecycle processes that are able to analyze processes\nthat lack a particular end state. Techniques for vitalizing processes must be able\nto analyze how their different runs impact the entity and, additionally, enable a\ncomparison of them.\nR2: Recurring behaviour. We observe that classical BPM techniques assume\na teleological process from a defined start to a desired end [36]. Often, this idea\nis already encoded in the name of the business process, as with order-to-cash,\nprocure-to-pay, and lead-to-close processes [8]. Recurring behavior can occur\nwithin a process execution and needs special attention in the representation, e.g.,\nthe iteration workflow patterns [26]. Recurring behavior is often classified as\nwaste in the process analysis [8]. The problem is that vitalizing processes are\noften enacted repeatedly over the lifecycle of an entity [5]. This is not a matter of\nwaste, but a key feature. Accordingly, we require analysis techniques for lifecycle\nprocesses that are able to consider recurring behavior. Furthermore, they must\nbe able to incorporate the idea that vitalizing processes might differ, overlap,\nand depend on each other.\nR3: Temporal Regularity of Processes. We observe that classical business\nprocesses are often expected to be completed as fast as possible [8]. That is\nwhy many BPM methods are focused on remaining time [34] or waiting time\nprediction [27]. The problem is that lifecycle processes are often expected to"}, {"title": "4.3 Other related Techniques and Discussion of Coverage", "content": "Based on our requirements analysis, we want to discuss how existing areas\nof research can contribute to the development of new analysis techniques for\nlifecycle-related processes. We identified three areas of research that provide us\nwith essential components for future analysis techniques: (i) time series analysis,\n(ii) social sequence analysis, and (iii) mortality analysis.\nTime Series Analysis. The research area of time series [11] is concerned with\nextracting useful information, such as patterns, from time series data. Typical\nanalysis tasks in this area include forecasting time series, clustering similar time\nseries, segmenting a time series, and anomaly detection. However, the most\nrelevant is the area of motif discovery [31], identifying frequent unknown patterns\nwith time series. Future techniques for lifecycle-related processes can build on\nmotif discovery and try to link discovered motifs from the vital signs with events\nor states from the event/state sequences. Furthermore, time series techniques\ncould be applied to vital signs to provide helpful information about the vital\nsigns that could be used to inform actions with vitalizing processes. One specific\ntechnique in this context is change point detection. This technique detects the\npoint in time when change occurs [15], making it an integral part of concept drift\nanalysis. Overall, it can be said that existing techniques from time series analysis\nprovide a substantial component for lifecycle-related processes by helping to\nutilize hidden information from vital signs.\nSocial Sequence Analysis. Social sequence analysis [2,6] is concerned with\ntracing social phenomena over time. The input data is typically defined as a\nsequence of states [14]. Critical design decisions are related to the granularity of\nthe time intervals at which state sequences are captured. Typical analysis tasks for\nstate sequences include describing stochastic patterns, analyzing homogeneity and\nstationarity, optimal matching, or sequence network construction [6]. Specifically\ninteresting for analyzing the lifecycle process is stationarity analysis. If a sequence\nis stationary, then the probability to transition from, e.g., state A to B is the\nsame, no matter in which segment it occurs. Understanding such properties might\nprovide indications of recurring behavior, temporal regularity, and the impact of\nmotors on the lifecycle of an entity. Social sequence analysis also offers various\ntechniques for visualizing, sorting, and clustering cohorts of sequences, as well\nas measures of complexity and turbulence [14]. Overall, techniques from social\nsequence analysis address the requirements of the lifecycle process well because\nof their assumption that there is no clear start or end.\nMortality Analysis. Mortality analysis studies the causes of death in popu-\nlations [22]. This requires various methodologies and approaches to understand\nmortality rates, life expectancy, and factors influencing death. There are four\nmain types of mortality analysis. First, descriptive mortality analysis involves\nstudying death rates, causes of death, and their distribution among different\npopulations, regions, or time periods. Second, life table analysis helps analyze\nmortality rates across different age groups, providing insights into life expectancy\nand survival probabilities. Third, cause-specific mortality analysis examines the"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we showed that traditional BPM techniques predominantly address\nteleological business processes with defined start and end states, e.g., purchase-\nto-pay processes. This research highlighted the existence of lifecycle process of a\nfocal entity, such as a patient, displaying either a natural increase or diminution.\nThey are supported by vitalizing processes that foster or stabilize the lifecycle\nprocess. We provided a conceptual model with the key ingredients of a lifecycle\nprocess and a data model. We discussed the requirements of analysis techniques\nfor lifecycle and vitalizing processes and showed that previous research work only\ncovered parts of them. We have come to the conclusion that many specialized\naspects of lifecycle and vitalizing processes are already supported by existing\nresearch. This existing research can serve as a foundation for analysis techniques\ntargeted towards lifecycle processes.\nThis paper is centered on identifying and conceptualizing the problem space\nwithout offering direct solutions. We envision this groundwork as a catalyst for a\nnew line of research within BPM. In the future, we plan to develop appropriate\nanalysis techniques for lifecycle and their vitalizing processes and plan to apply\nthem to real-world data. Furthermore, an important next step for the research\nlies in the collection of data from the lifecycle and vitalizing business processes."}]}

Traditional financial default prediction relies on the\nanalysis of historical data and credit scoring models, but in a complex financial\nenvironment, the authenticity, timeliness and privacy of data have long plagued\nfinancial institutions' attempts to avoid financial defaults. Therefore, how to\neffectively use new technologies to improve the accuracy of financial default\nprediction has become the current research focus (Sazu & Jahan, 2022). The use of\nblockchain technology may help reduce the risk of financial default.

Machine learning could be\nregarded as one of the important branches of Artificial Intelligence if we look at it\nfrom the standpoint of data processing and model calculation. Through data\ncalculation models (Addo et al., 2018), machine learning was developed in the\nartificial intelligence field; it utilizes large scale data and can effectively predict a risk\nfor potential financial defaults. But conventional machine learning models are\nstruggling with data quality and security \u2013 particularly financial data is very sensitive,\nhence the likelihood of data breaches outweighs.\nWith the gradual maturity of new technologies, the integration of blockchain\ntechnology and artificial intelligence to solve financial default problems has become\none of the current directions of financial science. The decentralized data storage and\nsharing mechanism of the blockchain provides a trusted and high-quality data source\nfor machine learning, and machine learning can train more accurate default prediction\nmodels with these trusted data. The accuracy of financial default prediction can be\nfurther improved based on fusion technology (Chakraborty et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "Statement of the Problem", "content": "Due to the considerable financial risks in global financial sector, prediction of\nfinancial default is an inevitable problem that can not be neglected for every finance\ninstitution. It is clear that the traditional historical data-based or credit scoring model\ndefault prediction approaches are not effective in an ever more intricate global\nfinancial system (Ciampi et al., 2021).\nThe accuracy of data plays a crucial role in the ability to predict financial risks.\nNonetheless, the conventional data storage manners tend to be highly exposed to\nhuman involvement and they are also opportunistic for data forgery or\nmissing.Besides these drawbacks, non-professional parties present inbetween two\nentities could exert difficultness of trusting between each others will (Karim et al.,\n2022). This has some direct consequences that, for example, credit worthy is\ngenerally otherwise and the training data quality from traditional prediction models"}, {"title": null, "content": "declines further leading to default predictions even less accurate from financial\ninstitution.\nFinancial data has always been a highly sensitive type of data. Traditional centralized\nstorage is very prone to risks of data leakage and data theft during data sharing and\ndata transmission (Cucari et al., 2021). Therefore, centralized storage limits the data\nsharing cooperation of current financial institutions, which further affects the amount\nof data for training models and causes bottlenecks in model training.\nTraditional financial default models rely on static data and relatively delayed financial\ninformation, which cannot reflect the rapidly changing market environment and huge\nchanges in customer credit status in real time (Alsaleem & Hasoon, 2020). In addition,\ntraditional financial risk prediction models have difficulty capturing potential default\nrisks in the face of the current financial environment (Addo et al., 2018), which\nfurther results in insufficient accuracy of financial risk prediction results.\nAgainst this background and problem, this study attempts to provide a new solution\nand improve the accuracy of financial default prediction by combining blockchain and\nartificial intelligence (machine learning). However, this technical combination still\nfaces many challenges at the practical application level, including how to efficiently\nintegrate blockchain and artificial intelligence systems, how to design machine\nlearning algorithms that are adapted to the blockchain environment, and how to\nachieve large-scale data sharing while ensuring data privacy. Therefore, this study\naims to optimize the financial default prediction model by exploring the integration of\nblockchain and machine learning technology, and to solve the key problems of data,\nprivacy, and prediction accuracy currently faced by the system."}, {"title": "Research objectives", "content": "1.

Based on a literature review of current literature\non financial default prediction, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning and other fields, the progress of current research and the limitations of the\ntechnology are clarified. On this basis, a theoretical framework for financial default\nprediction based on blockchain combined with artificial intelligence is constructed.\nFurther, a decentralized data storage and sharing mechanism based on blockchain is\nimplemented based on reliable financial data to solve the trust and security issues of\ndata transmission between traditional financial institutions. After processing and\nintegrating the data, machine learning techniques are used for model construction and\noptimization. This research will combine various models such as deep learning,\nrandom forests, and support vector machines to select algorithms suitable for different\nscenarios. The focus is on exploring how to optimize the computational efficiency of\nalgorithms under the distributed data structure of the blockchain, and to compare the\naccuracy and performance of the models in predicting default risks through\nexperiments.

The introduction of\nblockchain technology provides an innovative solution to this problem. This\ninnovative model dynamic update mechanism provides a new direction for risk\nmanagement of financial institutions, and also provides theoretical basis and practical\nguidance for the future application of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology\nin the financial sector."}, {"title": "Summary", "content": "In summary, with the rapid development of financial technology, the importance of\nfinancial default prediction is becoming increasingly prominent.

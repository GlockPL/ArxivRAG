Fine-tuning with LoRA involves training only the low-rank matrices A and B while keeping the original weights frozen. Additionally, it modifies the forward pass during inference to integrate the updates from the low-rank matrices, enabling domain-specific customization without the need to retrain the entire model.\nW'= W+(A\u00d7B)\nHere, W is the frozen pre-trained weight matrix, and W' incorporates domain-specific knowledge.\nPerformance Metrics: The performance metrics show a 20% improvement in F1-score for domain-specific accuracy on legal corpora. The memory footprint is reduced by 75% compared to full fine-tuning. Additionally, training time is accelerated by 3 to 5 times due to fewer trainable parameters.\nA practical example of fine-tuning an LLM for medical question answering (QA) using LoRA shows that only 0.1% to 1% of the model's parameters are updated. This approach leads to a 15% improvement in accuracy on PubMed datasets compared to zero-shot performance.\nHybrid Use with RAG: Integrating LoRA with RAG optimizes domain adaptation by combining efficient fine-tuning with enhanced factual retrieval.

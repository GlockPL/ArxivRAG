However, the amount of train-\ning data used to train these large models is growing exponentially,\nleading to substantial training hurdles. The training dataset con-\ntains two primary types of information: content-based informa-\ntion (features of users and items) and collaborative information\n(interactions between users and items). One approach to reduce\nthe training dataset is to remove user-item interactions. But that\nsignificantly diminishes collaborative information, which is cru-\ncial for maintaining accuracy due to its inclusion of interaction\nhistories. This loss profoundly impacts DLRM performance. This\npaper makes an important observation that if one can capture the\nuser-item interaction history to enrich the user and item embed-\ndings, then the interaction history can be compressed without los-\ning model accuracy. Thus, this work, Collaborative Aware Data\nCompression (CADC), takes a two-step approach to training dataset\ncompression. In the first step, we use matrix factorization of the\nuser-item interaction matrix to create a novel embedding repre-\nsentation for both the users and items. Once the user and item em-\nbeddings are enriched by the interaction history information the\napproach then applies uniform random sampling of the training\ndataset to drastically reduce the training dataset size while mini-\nmizing model accuracy drop.

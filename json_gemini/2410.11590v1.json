{"title": "Towards a Healthy Al Tradition:\nLessons from Biology and Biomedical Science", "authors": ["Simon Kasif"], "abstract": "In the old days, many Artificial Intelligence (Al) scientists were trained with a focus on\napplication of symbolic methods, deductive methods using logic and discrete optimization (called search\nin Al). Today, inductive learning and deep learning more specifically is all the rage in Al. I was fortunate\nto be trained in both since I was co-mentored by two Al legends (Jack Minker and Azriel Rosenfeld) who\nstudied Al from divergent logical reasoning and human perception (computer vision) angles respectively.\nThey appreciated the complexity of the challenge and respected their differences in approaching Al with\nhumility. In addition to working in Al, they were both humanitarians with a giant heart. Inspired by their\nlegacy, the new year presents an opportunity to express gratitude to all that Al accomplished and ask:\nCan we foresee a healthy foundation that Al researchers can build on given the new scale and\npace of Al developments? More specifically, can we advance Al safer and better by gratitude,\ncooperation across subfields of Al, a constructive and interdisciplinary analysis of the\nlimitations and challenges ahead by observing the culture of more established sciences?", "sections": [{"title": null, "content": "This question is particularly timely given the Al discussion at the highest levels of government,\nrecent turbulence at Open Al, previous bumps at other major companies, historical precedents and the\nrepeated flames in the press that often lack historical context and full appreciation of the challenges\nahead. There is little doubt that the debates about Al safety and other risks are both timely and\nessential, and the so called existential danger for humanity from Al has some merit as well. However,\nhow do we balance the effectively immeasurable benefits from Al for society, science, medicine,\nindustry, economy and human wellness against the still poorly understood risks?\nAl is a magnificent field that directly and profoundly touches on numerous disciplines ranging\nfrom philosophy, computer science, engineering, mathematics, decision and data science and\neconomics, to cognitive science, neuroscience and more. The number of applications and impact of Al is\nsecond to none and the potential of Al to broadly impact future science developments is particularly\nthrilling. While attempts to understand knowledge, reasoning, cognition and learning go back\ncenturies, Al remains a relatively new field. In part due to the fact it has so many wide-ranging overlaps\nwith other disparate fields it appears to have trouble developing a robust identity and culture. Here we\nsuggest that contrasting the fast-moving Al culture to biological and biomedical sciences is both\ninsightful and useful way to inaugurate a healthy tradition needed to envision and manage our ascent to\nAGI and beyond (independent of the Al Platforms used). After all, the human brain is a biological organ\nproduced by evolution and human intelligence is a remarkable bi-product of nature and nurture and\ntheir complex interaction. In this perspective, we focus on traditions and culture, namely the commonly\nobserved practices of evaluating, recognizing applauding, critiquing, debating and managing all progress\nincluding useful advances and discovery of challenging limitations. We are not discussing specific\nscientific exchanges between Al and Biology that include interdisciplinary cross fertilization of scientific\nmethods, technology, ideas and applications that have been amply demonstrated and will continue to\nbe transformative in the future. In a previous perspective, we suggested that biomedical laboratories or\ncenters can usefully embrace logistic traditions in Al labs that will allow them to be highly collaborative,\nimprove the reproducibility of research, reduce risk aversion and produce faster mentorship pathways\nfor PhDs and fellows. This perspective focuses on the benefits of Al as a field, learning from the\nbiomedical culture at higher, primarily conceptual levels."}, {"title": "Al safety Is likely to be challenging: no shortcuts expected", "content": "Similar to medicine, biology and biotechnology, Al scholars, ethicists, engineers, users and\nreporters must to be cognizant of historical, theoretical, scientific, technological, ethical and engineering\nlandscapes and fully appreciate the challenges ahead to be able to reliably and constructively construct,\nvalidate, verify and manage Al systems. As one example, the folklore argument that simple minded\n(early stage) symbolic Al systems present less risk than deep learning is simply misleading to put it\nmildly. Interpretability is very important and so is truth However, one false logical \"fact\" that can be\nintroduced into a symbolic system by malicious viruses or programming errors would render anything a\nsymbolic Al system infers potentially false and useless. Anyone who ever programmed in logic\nprogramming or similar systems would know this well. One must also recall the amount of both\ningenuity and effort it took to verify relatively simple computer circuits with highly constrained and well-\ndefined functionalities. Now, imagine the \u201cverification\u201d of AGI. It does not become much easier if we\nwant to use statistical methods to prove one decision is significantly better than another. Just consider\nthe complexity of a fully designed clinical trial and/or rigorous causal inference. Without robust\nsolutions for these problems, both machines and humans will continue making errors on both simple\nand complex problems.\nAdditionally, looking at our own history, since when did human intelligence provide a safety net\nthat prevented inconceivable wrong (recall slavery or women's rights as two examples). The Al safety\nand risk issues are challenging, profound and require our best minds and top resources independent of\nAl platforms (e.g., symbolic, neural, causal, Bayesian, logic based, probabilistic, or integrated\napproaches). Similar to any high-risk technology (from medicine to space) there would be no shortcuts\nto Al safety without traditional and/or novel methodologies that will include verification, statistical\nvalidation, engineering and physics style modeling, causal and interventional analysis, explanation and\nextensive testing by both experts and the public. We might need to design rigorous causal and other\ninferential trials that expand on clinical trials and are soundly designed to reveal flaws in Al systems. In\nour projects, we in fact aimed to go beyond common practices in interpretable Al and build machinery\nto trace machine predictions to their sources. Al presents significant risks with or without achieving the\nso called AGI. Toxic data that can be easily placed in \"foundation models\" may corrupt anything they\npredict. Most technologies present somber risks. We all recently witnessed the profound impact of pain\nkillers on public health. Thousands die or get injured in car accidents. Similarly, Al risks must be carefully\nstudied by both interdisciplinary experts and others without panic, over-regulation and grandiosity while\nwe judiciously advance Al theory, Al science and its safe reduction to practice.\nAlmost 30 years ago NSF led a large-scale initiative in Human-Centered Systems (HCS) that was\nfocused on integrating human-computer interaction with Al Systems. The author was among the four\norganizers of the HCS symposium that helped drive and catalyze the initiative at multiple agencies. The\nscale has radically changed and the challenges became much bigger and broader. But the premise that\nmost of the immediate risks are still found in misuse of Al systems in the hands of humans (via common\nerrors, malicious use or just poor understanding of limitations) is still vividly relevant. Basic Al science\nmust remain a high priority in addition to forming a discipline of human-centered Al (HCAI) that follows\nand expands on HCS. We hypothesize that in collaboration with Al experts, Citizen's Science may play an\nessential role in producing gold databases, testing the safety of Al methods and validation of\npredictions. Inspired by the Human Genome Project and similar biomedical initiatives, distributed but\ncooperating multi-scale HCAI centers/cores supporting community-wide efforts can be established and\nfunded by industry, government and non-profits. Especially, for critical applications such as science,\nmedicine, law, government and education. Today, most of the key Al developments are produced by\nindustry. Should we have a parallel public effort to build open access HCAI safety platforms both across\nand within domain such as life sciences, engineering, medicine and education?"}, {"title": "Al advances: towards a new educational tradition of gratitude and recognition", "content": "During the early Al, most of the emphasis in the field was largely focused on knowledge\nrepresentation, logical or other forms of inference, Al search, reasoning, constraints, planning, and\napplications. However, even before the previously inconceivable advances in applications of Al to\nMachine Translation or Protein Folding it is important to remember that \u201cold\u201d Al had a number of major\npractical success stories in addition to profound conceptual and scientific impact. These include the first\nchess and checkers systems that dominated humans, grammatical parsers of human and computer\nlanguages, novel programming languages (such as LISP) that became main stream and widely used,\nsymbolic manipulation systems such as Mathematica, chess end game analysis systems that significantly\nexpanded on human capability, early semantic knowledge representations that were simplified and\nbecame de-facto standard in the context of the semantic web, mathematical theorem provers that led\nto computer circuit verification, causal reasoning and much more. Multiple machine learning systems\nand ideas that originated in Al, such as decision trees or graphical models quickly became integrated and\nconverged with established statistical methods that emerged from statistics or physics and became\nwidely used in multiple fields as well. The applications ranged from astronomy to business, from\nmedicine to biology and marketing (e.g., Netflix), email filtering or human computer interfaces (HCI).\n\"Old\", symbolic or probabilistic Al systems produced a number of wondrous success stories in speech\nrecognition, text to speech, robotics, computer vision, HCI, and more. Do people remember today that\nCheckers were literally solved by an Al group, leading to a win over the world champion. In biological\nscience, probabilistic Al methods produced numerous scientific breakthroughs. One development that\nthe author contributed to directly is an Al based gene identification systems that literally helped\nproduce the full gene catalogue of bacterial species on earth leading to wide reaching progress in\nbiotechnology, medicine, basic science and beyond. In the Human Genome Project, the international\nHGP team used an Al based system that adopted methods from speech recognition and predicted all the\nregions where human genes reside on the genome, making a profound contribution to biology and\nmedicine.\nHowever, none of these advances appears to be associated with Al anymore and its relatively\nconsistent progress over the years. Instead, these advances were ripped as limited during the early\nstages and quickly forgotten after their reduction to practice. The attacks on Deep Learning today are a\nrecent example of the Al Ripper. Yes, the ethical challenges are real and are shared with other statistical,\npredictive decision sciences and must be tackled by multiple disciplines. However, recent previously\nunimaginable Al advances (such as machine translation, chatGPT or Alphafold) must be celebrated as\nmajor breakthroughs even if we are far from achieving the so called AGI. In many ways, Al suffers from\nthe Rodney Dangerfield syndrome. It never gets genuine intellectual respect and its successes get fused\ninto other fields and often get lost in the historical shuffle. Science thrives on debate and Popperian\ndoubt. However, we are not familiar with any other scientific or technical field that received such a high\nratio of brutal critiques vs recognition, given the numerous major successes. This repeated pattern of\nbrutal Al carnage is surprising given how complex achieving human level intelligence appears to be, not\nto mention achieving genuine safety and/or rationality in decision making across applications. Al is\nmoving too fast. Similar to biomedical science, it appears prudent to build a historical tradition of\ngratitude and recognition for Al advances and a rigorous but broad interdisciplinary foundation for\ncritical and ethical Al science. Al education critically depends on this foundation."}, {"title": "Al Challenges: Contrasting Al to Biology and Precision Medicine", "content": "We remind the readers again that the human brain is a construct produced by evolution of living\nspecies. Perfect rationality remains elusive and challenging for both humans and machines. This has\nbeen amply demonstrated in the work of behavioral economists such as Kahneman and Tversky. There\nis a reason why Herb Simon, an early Al legend coined the term \"satisficing\" to delineate the challenge\nof reaching optimal decision making. Causal reasoning remains a challenge not to mention real\nunderstanding. There are other deep but relevant issues that have been debated by Al leaders over the\nyears. There are two very important foundational and educational hypotheses that cross fields.\nNeither biology nor Al will be easy to understand or program safely. Neither biology nor Al stop\nprogressing once they pass a certain critical point (e.g. discovery of DNA structure or \u201cachieving\u201d AGI in\nthe future). Thus, we must document and scientifically recognize all significant advances in\nperformance of Al systems even without a deep and universally accepted understanding of cognition,\nconsciousness or AGI. We have no idea how idea how simple biological machines such as proteins solve\nthe protein folding problem efficiently in milliseconds or even less with minimal energy as compared to\nsimulations or prediction of folding on computers. We are far from understanding protein function.\nHowever, multiple Nobel Prizes have been awarded for protein science and/or protein engineering that\nproduced seminal advances in our quest to understand protein function. We all justifiably remain highly\nempathetic with the biomedical heroes working to find a cure for Alzheimer's, Diabetes Type 1 or other\ndiseases that largely resisted clinical progress. Two recent examples of precision medicine and CRISPR\nare highly illustrative of the triumphant response to seminal advances despite numerous limitations.\nGleevec, is a major but specialized pharmaceutical advance that produces close to 100%\nresponse in treating a very specific cancer. It is one of the best examples of precision medicine, namely\nmedications that target a specialized patient population. Can we imagine anyone suggesting that this\ninnovative drug is not significant because it applies to only a very specific gene fusion of two proteins\nthat causes the initial neoplasia. Similarly consider advances such as immuno-therapy or EGFR inhibitors.\nBoth novel or older treatments have multiple side effects, limited and hard to predict success rate,\nnumerous problems in application, drug resistance and more. Nevertheless, medicine justifiably\ncelebrates these advances as major milestones in precision medicine. Nobody is arguing that\nimprovement from 10% success rate of a cancer drug to 20% in a targeted patient population does not\nproduce \"precision\" in an absolute sense. Instead, we rightly celebrate the significant increase in survival\nrates for targeted patients (using predictive methods that will increasingly use Al technology). Biology is\ncomplex and makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy prediction of drug response, the tenet of\nprecision medicine. However, the challenge is acknowledged by the scientific community, the medical\npractitioners and the public. We must also openly acknowledge that AGI is likely to be as challenging as\nprecision medicine but progress will be continuously made on both technology and its safety."}, {"title": "Al Platforms: Contrasting Al sub-cultures to Synthetic Biology (SB)", "content": "CRISPR is a revolutionary technology that appears to be reasonable to compare Al to in terms of\nimpact and existential and/or other risks. CRISPR is an ingenious development that allows biomedical\nscientists and engineers to edit genomes. It comes with significant future benefits and major risks. The\nbiomedical community has been able to quickly agree on the need for regulation without frenzied\ndebates seen in parts of the Al world and the press. In particular, nobody is discussing CRISPR as a future\nweapon of colonialism in the wrong hands. While both advances in biotechnology and Al have severe\nlimitations, and carry a high risk (including a hypothetical existential threat to human civilization), the\ndifferences in the culture of public coverage and internal debates are profound. It appears to be\nworthwhile to adopt the relative sanity, patience and humility found in biomedical sciences when\ndiscussing Al challenges, limitations and risks.\nOne of the areas that is generating a heated, borderline religious debate is focused on Al\nPlatforms, namely the relative capability of neural, symbolic (logic), probabilistic, or other frameworks.\nDoes the current choice of neural architectures prove a strict domination of one Al platform vs others in\nthe current stage of our quest for AGI? On surface, the early progress in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing pales as compared to the borderline miraculous innovations observed during the\nrecent decade. We should look at these early historical developments with respect. Our mentors wrote\nfundamental papers with titles such as \"What is an Edge\" (in an image) or studying when a sentence is\ngrammatically correct. We must humbly consider the possibility that the progress we are observing\ntoday using deep learning on neural architectures is an engineering feat rooted in its alignment to\ncurrent computing power (e.g. GPUs) and storage. It is not clear, what is the relative contribution of\nneural architectures specifically to monumental progress in Al vs other recent technological or\nalgorithmic developments. Such a debate must include pure systems issues that include parallelism, CPU\nspeed, GPUs, storage, programming advances such as TensorFlow, mathematical advances, the size of\ndatasets and their management that reduce overfitting and numerous technical advances such as\nattention or data transformations (embeddings) that can be implemented on multiple platforms. We\nmust consider comparative resource allocations as well. Using a sport analogy we must ask \"Is it the\nracquet or the player\u201d question, namely the relative capability of academic vs industrial teams. We can\nhypothesize that hybrid technologies (that integrate neural, logical, probabilistic, memory-based or\ncausal subsystems) may be the most effective and safe bets for future Al deployment. Or perhaps as\nargued by Noam Chomsky or Roger Penrose we are missing something fundamental yet to be\ndiscovered. However, at the moment, neural architectures dominate on multiple astounding\napplications from chatGPT to AlphaFold. Most researchers in Al understand this reality while\ndeveloping a better theory and interpretable Al methods.\nTo attain a perspective on Al platforms comparisons, it is educational to contrast the frictions\nbetween Al sub-cultures to conceptually similar tensions in Synthetic Biology (SB) between two\nculturally different approaches to SB that are also moving at a different pace. One culture in SB is based\non bottom up synthesis driven by biochemistry, genomics, biology, engineering and \u201chacking nature\u201d.\nThis sub-culture is producing startling advances such as engineering whole genomes of living organisms,\nreprogramming biological systems from bacteria to immune or cancer cells, tissue engineering and\nmore. The other approach is using logic based design using \"semi-formal\" specifications of \"biological\ncircuits\". Logic based SB is making wonderful and useful progress as well but is currently behind,\nespecially with respect to most spectacular success stories of SB. However, members of all communities\ncontinue a productive dialogue expecting full future cooperation. The profound challenge of\nprogramming biology effectively and safely is fully acknowledged and is respected by all communities. In\nfact, Al might play an important role in these developments as we argued in 1993.\nIn view of the complexity of AGI, Al critics may want to adopt some of the cooler and more\nbalanced language as found in biomedical fields when discussing and debating Al platforms. Supporters\nof one platform can still fully acknowledge any measurable progress made by any Al platform. We don't\nunderstand how children manage to read, write, think, ask questions, play and compose music without\ncompiling the entire knowledge universe (as done my modern Al systems). In fact, no current Al\nplatform can mimic the small knowledge / data requirements of early human development. However,\ngratitude for any significant progress in Al should be the starting and ending point in every debate.\nGiven the gaps in our knowledge and ability there are no bad or wrong Al platforms. Let's both applaud\nand critically evaluate all we can do today and by inspiration from biology look forward with excitement\nto progress and cooperation on current Al platforms and/or discovery or emergence of new ones."}, {"title": "Al safety and development speed: there is no contradiction", "content": "Despite the complexity of Al and the significant scientific, ethical and technological challenges\nahead, the Al business question is relatively simple. What fraction of resources should be dedicated to\nAl safety and/or Al basic science vs rapid technological Al advances and applications? In Machine\nLearning this ratio is sometimes referred to as the exploration vs exploitation rate that should be\njudiciously augmented with Al safety. In our mind, the Al business and ethics questions are inherently\ninterrelated and have significant scientific and technical overlaps. The answers are clearly dependent on\ncontext but a relatively small investment in scientific, technological, ethical and business savvy\nleadership teams should produce good logistic answers for planning the Al investment portfolios.\nSimilar, to biomedical disciplines, Al science, ethics and business can be cohesively built and\ndisseminated using a healthy tradition. One worthy example is the budget allocation in the early phase\nof the human genome project by the genomic pioneer Charles DeLisi that included a very significant\nethics component. However, Al has proven itself, over and over again in the past and has unlimited\nfuture potential. Al will not stop developing when we reach a particular technological milestone by\nsome measurement associated with AGI. Similar to medicine, the Al foundation and culture must be\nrobust and culturally influenced by our equally ambitious attempts to understand and reprogram\nbiology. Historically, no new technology succeeded without \u201cinspectors\u201d, critics, consumer reports,\nregulation, theory and basic science. In 1990-s we postulated that \"human-centered systems (HCS)\" is\nthe safest approach to building any intelligent computer systems and addressing the alignment problem\nin Al systems in particular. The scale has changed, multiple major breakthroughs have been made but\nthe challenges remain and we continue attracting thousands of the most creative minds to the Al field\nor its applications. Let's thank Al for this evolution and humbly accentuate a healthy tradition for the\nnew Al generation of users, developers and benefactors. Pun intended. Similar to biomedical science\nand medicine, we optimistically hope that the power of Al will force humanity to become more ethical,\nempathetic and compassionate to ensure a just and ethical application of Al."}, {"title": "An annotated reading list (these papers are merely a small sample as there are hundreds of\nseminal advances in these spaces.

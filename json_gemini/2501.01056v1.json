{"title": "Risks of Cultural Erasure in Large Language Models", "authors": ["Rida Qadri", "Aida M.

Second, we analyze the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. We have chosen cities as our unit of analysis as they provide a standardized proxy list for representing global communities and cultures, unlike, for example, ethnicity which is collected differently in different parts of the world (if at all). Cities also are sites for global trans-national flows and inter-cultural engagement through literature, news, finance and tourism and thus serve as stand-ins or signifiers for global communities in global discourse [41, 6, 10]. This methodology is general and can be repeated on a variety of identity markers or other units of global social sub-groupings. Through this study, we introduce new ways to measure both the quality and extent of cultural representation in language models across different settings and for different groups.\nOur study thus shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks. We contribute to past work in ML documenting the Western biases embedded in many benchmarks and systems [40, 5, 12, 29], and advance beyond that framing to consider broader questions about how systems produce, reinforce and shape cultural representations and meaning. This is particularly important as technical advances enable more precise methods of mitigating harms in systems built on language models [36, 15, 4, 34]."}, {"title": "2.1 Study 1: Erasure by Simplification: How locales are represented", "content": "To assess the extent of cultural simplification in LLMs, we probed a pre-trained language model to create descriptions [9] of 50 global cities and analyzed the themes and lexical categories that emerged in outputs. Such thematic analysis is a common tool used in media studies to assess quality of representation and associations in media discourse. Thematic associations that emerge in descriptions of different cities can be important windows into the narratives built about corresponding cultural contexts.\nFor each city we used 5 different prompt templates, selecting 10 output samples for each query. Crowdworker annotators then coded these 2500 generated descriptions for presence of eight representational themes: culture, economy, demography, geography, government, history, industry, political situations, and social issues (see Appendix 5.1-5.2 for more details on annotation). Table 1 gives more information about each theme, including representative words from text that was coded for a"}, {"title": "2.2 Study 2: Erasure by Omission : When locales are represented", "content": "Differences in representational associations within language models can also have tangible impacts on how well they support the use case of cultural discovery and production. We study cultural erasure in the specific application scenario of online travel recommendations, using a widely-available developer API [17]. In particular, we analyze recommendations generated by the model for a range of prompts which followed the structure \"I like interest cue. Which city should I visit?\", with 7 different interest cues such as art, museums, and spirituality. We draw 280 total samples across 7 interest cues. See Section 4.2 for more implementation details.\nFirst, we find disparities in which regions of the world get represented most in overall travel recommendations. In Table 2, we find that 8 sub-regions of the world have no representation and 8 sub regions have minimal representation (\u2264 10% probability). This erasure by omission impacts all regions in Africa and 4 out of the 5 Asian sub-regions. In comparison, the regions with higher"}, {"title": "3 Discussion", "content": "Despite the increasingly crucial role language technologies play in content creation and cultural dissemination, not much work has looked into their role as cultural technologies both in reflecting and reinforcing existing cultural power. Media technologies, and thus, language technologies, have a significant role to play in shaping our social realities and amplifying existing power discourse. We thus follow the field of 'critical discourse analysis' to study how \"social-power [...] and inequality are enacted, reproduced, legitimated, and resisted\" in language model responses [45]. By linking the outputs of language technology we studied in this paper to existing social and political histories, our findings indicate language technologies can build similar narratives that in the past have been used to homogenize and mis-represent non-western cultures ([42]). Thus, our two studies show the importance of examining how language models, like previous forms of media, can contribute to erasure of cultures and knowledge systems from our collective digital worlds. They also interrogate which specific media representations models are amplifying and which they are erasing. This work points to a major challenge in building culturally inclusive generative AI technology.\nIn study 1, we see possible dangers of models being uncritically built on data ingested from"}, {"title": "4 Methods and Data", "content": "existing media representations. Language model outputs repeated a particular form of erasure seen in existing media, which Adichie [1] calls a 'single story': a simplistic, one-dimensional narrative and representation being attached to groups, reconfiguring how particular groups are talked about or understood. Skewed thematic scores for different continents indicate there may be a chance of language model outputs produced for those continents representing only one side of them. For example, representations of European contexts would continue to highlight its cultural strengths, while representations of African stories would more narrowly focus on economic development, continuing a trend Adichie sees as part of the \"tradition of telling African stories in the West. A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness\" [1]. Through such single stories people's agency and power to represent diverse aspects of their identity is taken away. Historically, single stories have lead to simplistic understandings used to justify imperialist ends e.g. representations of Africa from early 20th century colonists, academics and missionaries have been critiqued to show how they build stories of Africa's primitiveness which aided in maintaining colonization in Africa [44].\nThere are more diverse media and stories that have been published emerging from these contexts, but our results raise the question of whether language models have been trained on or have learned effectively from these sources.\nStudy 2 shows the possible downstream impacts of erasure and simplistic associations continuing in language technology systems, without targeted mitigation methods. Travel planning has been put forth as a use case for language technologies with articles claiming an upcoming 'shakeup' [48] of the industry. Online travel recommendations are also a large part of travel market [28, 48, 43]. However, our study shows the major gaps in travel recommendations where particular regions are erased in the recommendations produced by applications built with language model-based APIs. Analysis using preliminary interest cues that can be used to personalize travel also shows how existing biases can be reproduced, such as the western world being the centre of the world's 'art' and architecture' while East Asia being a destination for spiritual awakening'-a narrative that also continues western colonial tropes. In particular such western gaze on travel recommendations is concerning because the online travel industry is a $475b industry with some estimates suggesting that in 2022 two-thirds of revenue came from online sales channels [43]. Travel demand is usually highly localized and there is thus a danger that these travel recommendations may be universalizing assumptions of a particular market to the globe and thus be less useful for particular user groups.\nThere are several limitations to our study. First, crowd annotators may lack nuanced sociocultural knowledge required to accurately evaluate themes of representation across such different places and cultures. Second, we evaluate one language model and one API, and other system may have different forms of cultural erasure. Finally, the tasks, evaluation sets and metrics we consider reflect only a limited subset of the cultural representations that such systems are used to produce.\nBy understanding erasure that can occur in applications built on language models and language-model based APIs, we see the need to be more attuned to the gaps and representational biases present in training data at each layer, while also considering processes of model development that lead to more nuanced and inclusive representations of people's own cultural contexts. Our study in particular shows the limitations of including large amounts of the indexed internet as an archive of our collective cultures, since this is going to be a limited and uneven archive where certain perspectives are more represented than others, as has been pointed out by other scholarship [19, 33, 20, 13]. However our study also shows the importance of nuanced understandings of representation. Statistical parity of data is also not enough because we also have to look critically at how cultures and communities are represented, not just that they are represented. We also show how granular slicing of regions can show further levels of within-region erasures and representational biases. [16]\nWe thus push for prioritizing cultural representation as an important aspect of evaluating generative AI technologies. In particular, following the field of critical discourse studies, the linguistic evaluation techniques we use should also pay attention to how text relates to the global geo-political power structures and histories these technologies are intervening in, rather than merely looking for technical biases. We can build towards this goal by fundamentally respecting the expertise of different"}, {"title": "4.1 Study 1: Simplification in how locales are represented", "content": "disciplinary communities that have studied the intersection of technology and society and learning from how other disciplines have approached the complex question of representation.

This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, on-device screening tool for Mpox, designed to function offline in low-resource environments.\nMethods: We developed a YOLOv8n-based deep learning model trained on 2,700 images (900 each of Mpox, other skin conditions, and normal skin), including synthetic data. The model was validated on 360 images and tested on 540 images. A larger external validation was conducted using 1,500 independent images. Performance metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity.\nFindings: The model demonstrated high accuracy (96%) in the final test set. For Mpox detection, it achieved 93% precision, 97% recall, and an F1-score of 95%. Sensitivity and specificity for Mpox detection were 97% and 96%, respectively. Performance remained consistent in the larger external validation, confirming the model's robustness and generalizability.\nInterpretation: This Al-driven screening tool offers a rapid, accurate, and scalable solution for Mpox detection in resource-constrained settings. Its offline functionality and high performance across diverse datasets suggest significant potential for improving Mpox surveillance and management, particularly in areas lacking traditional diagnostic infrastructure.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The recent declaration of Mpox as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in August 2024 underscores the urgent global health challenge posed by this evolving zoonotic disease.\u00b9 Concurrently, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) elevated Mpox to a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS), highlighting the disproportionate impact on the African continent.\u00b2\nMpox, once considered a rare and geographically limited disease, has rapidly transformed into a global health threat. The 2022 outbreak, which spread to over 40 countries, revealed the virus's potential for widespread transmission across diverse populations. By 2024, the situation in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), had reached critical levels, with the DRC accounting for over 96% of all cases on the continent. The emergence of clade 1b in the DRC, which has a much higher mortality rate than clade 2 that was responsible for the 2022 outbreak, is a significant global concern.\u00b3\nThe rapid spread in resource-limited settings is exacerbated by several factors:\n1. Inadequate healthcare infrastructure and manpower\n2. Limited access to diagnostic tools\n3. Insufficient public health resources like vaccinations\n4. Compounding social determinants of health, including high rates of malnutrition and HIV co-infection\nWhile Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing remains the gold standard for Mpox diagnosis, it presents significant barriers in low-resource settings due to high costs, need for specialized equipment, and requirement for trained personnel.\u2074,\u2075\nConsequently, the true burden of Mpox in these regions is likely underestimated, leading to suboptimal allocation of vaccines and treatments. The pressing need for innovative, scalable, and rapid screening solutions in resource-constrained environments has never been more apparent. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies have shown promise in enhancing infectious disease screening. Recent Systematic Review have demonstrated that deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can achieve high levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in Mpox detection, often matching traditional screening and diagnosing method. \u2076,\u2077,\u2078\nHowever, a critical limitation of existing Al tools is their reliance on cloud-based systems and internet connectivity, rendering them impractical in many remote or under-resourced areas. \u2079,\u00b9\u2070 This study addresses this gap by introducing an Al-driven, on-device screening tool specifically designed for offline use in low-resource settings. By leveraging deep learning models optimized for mobile platforms, our tool aims to provide accurate, real-time Mpox screening without the need for internet connectivity or sophisticated laboratory infrastructure."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "This study was designed as a descriptive analysis to build, validate, and test an Al-driven on-device screening tool for Mpox, specifically tailored for use in low-resource settings where internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable.

The images included in the \"Mpox group\" were either confirmed by PCR testing or clinically validated by a consultant physician. The \"Other Skin Conditions\" class in our dataset comprised a diverse range of dermatological presentations that could potentially be confused with Mpox lesions. This category included images of syphilis ulcers, herpes skin lesions, balanitis, eczemas, wound, scars, burn skin scars, skin cancers, skin tags, melanocytic nevi, vascular lesions, acne, cysts, follicular disorders, allergy rashes and other tumors, ensuring that our model was trained to differentiate Mpox from a wide spectrum of visually similar skin conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice. Total of 10,000 image pool were used in this study for all the different aspects of the model building including synthetic data generation. Data was reviewed by two physicians for diversity in terms of ethnicity of skin color. All the data was sourced from publicly available datasets from www.kaggle.com (Skin Disease Classification dataset and Acne Recognition Dataset), https://github.com (The Skin Condition Image Network(SCIN)) and HeHealth own data with relevant consent.\nEach class included 1200 images for each category, split into training (75%), validation"}, {"title": "Technology Selection", "content": "After evaluating multiple Al architectures, YOLOv8n (You Only Look Once, version 8 nano) was selected as the final model for deployment due to its low computational requirements and high accuracy. \u00b9\u00b2 YOLOv8n was selected over MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers due to its optimal balance of speed and accuracy, which makes it particularly well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\nPerformance comparison is shown in the table below."}, {"title": "Training", "content": "The model was trained using a dataset of 2700 images (900 per category).

First, the dataset used, despite being balanced and diverse, may not fully capture the global variability in Mpox presentations, which could affect the model's generalizability across different populations. Second, the reliance on synthetic data, although it has proven effective in enhancing the model's performance, may introduce biases that are not fully representative of real-world clinical scenarios. Finally, while the model has shown strong performance in initial testing, further external validation in varied healthcare settings is essential to confirm its robustness and reliability. These limitations underscore the need for ongoing research and testing to ensure the tool's efficacy in diverse, real-world environments."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "A key strength of our study is the two-stage validation process.

At the individual level, it allows for quick isolation and treatment prioritization, reducing forward transmission risk. On a broader scale at population level, it enhances surveillance, enabling more comprehensive screening, and to identify more positive cases, which is crucial for controlling outbreaks and preventing deaths. Financially, the tool offers a better return on investment by minimizing the need for costly PCR tests, allowing more efficient resource allocation.\nIn an ideal setting, Al screening should be used alongside PCR testing in the Mpox response to achieve multiple goals. Al screening focuses on identifying and isolating more positive cases to prevent further spread, while PCR testing validates the Al results and conducts detailed genetic analysis for viral mutations."}, {"title": "Implications for Public Health", "content": "The deployment of this Al tool could impact public health significantly, potentially influencing WHO guidelines and setting a new standard for diagnostics in low-resource settings.

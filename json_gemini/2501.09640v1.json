{"title": "ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS:\nTOWARDS DIGITAL TWINS IN HEALTHCARE", "authors": ["Muhammet Alkan", "Hester Huijsdens", "Yola Jones", "Fani Deligianni"], "abstract": "The pivotal shift from traditional paper-based records to sophisticated Electronic Health Records\n(EHR), enabled systematic collection and analysis of patient data through descriptive statistics,\nproviding insight into patterns and trends across patient populations. This evolution continued\ntoward predictive analytics, allowing healthcare providers to anticipate patient outcomes and potential\ncomplications before they occur. This progression from basic digital record-keeping to sophisticated\npredictive modelling and digital twins reflects healthcare's broader evolution toward more integrated,\npatient-centred approaches that combine data-driven insights with personalized care delivery. This\nchapter explores the evolution and significance of healthcare information systems, beginning with an\nexamination of the implementation of EHR in the UK and the USA. It provides a comprehensive\noverview of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, tracing its development from\nICD-9 to ICD-10. Central to this discussion is the MIMIC-III database, a landmark achievement in\nhealthcare data sharing and arguably the most comprehensive critical care database freely available to\nresearchers worldwide. MIMIC-III has democratized access to high-quality healthcare data, enabling\nunprecedented opportunities for research and analysis. The chapter examines its structure, clinical\noutcome analysis capabilities, and practical applications through case studies, with a particular\nfocus on mortality and length of stay metrics, vital signs extraction, and ICD coding. Through\ndetailed entity-relationship diagrams and practical examples, the text illustrates MIMIC's complex\ndata structure and demonstrates how different querying approaches can lead to subtly different results,\nemphasizing the critical importance of understanding the database's architecture for accurate data\nextraction. The chapter concludes by discussing the progression from descriptive analytics to digital\ntwins in healthcare, highlighting the transformation toward more sophisticated and personalized\nhealthcare information systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Electronic Health Records", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 Electronic Health Records", "content": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital versions of a patient's health information. EHRs exhibit a diverse\ncomposition, encompassing both structured and unstructured data types, such as medical images, Electrocardiograms\n(ECGs), laboratory results, narrative, diagnostic reports, medical interventions and hospitalisations.\nUnlike clinical trials, which follow-up patients at regular intervals (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 5 years), electronic health\nrecords capture data at irregular intervals by recording the dates of each event. For example, someone may be\nhospitalised for three days, receive extensive medical follow-up during these three days, and then not be seen by the\nmedical system for the following year (see Figure 1 as an example)."}, {"title": "1.2 The transition to Electronic Health Records in the UK and USA", "content": "The shift from paper-based to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has profoundly influenced healthcare data management,\nenhanced the quality of clinical decision making and opened new avenues for biomedical research. It also signaled a\ntransition from independent records to integrated databases.\nAn overview of the adoption of EHRs in the USA and UK healthcare systems are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3,\nrespectively. This transition took over the period of two decades and it highlights the challenges and requirements for a\nsuccessful integration. The US and the UK health care systems are organised very differently [Wilson and Khansa,\n2018]. UK has one of the largest public sector system. On the other hand, USA has the largest private-sector system\nand one of the largest health care expenditure in the world.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is the first of the USA laws to affect IT in healthcare [Ozair et al.,\n2015]. It was enacted in August of 1996. Part of this sets the rules and requirements for the privacy and security of\ninformation. This information was referred to as Protected Health Information. Rules were set in place for what and\nhow it could be accessed and shared. The purpose was to encourage the use of electronic data interchange by explaining\nhow data could safely be shared between parties. Part of it was to define standards for corporations to abide by and thus\nhelp building interoperability.\nDespite HIPAA, by 2006, over 80% of US physicians lacked access to EHRs, leading to efforts to establish a nationwide\nhealth information network and the extension of Protected Health Information (PHI) responsibility to business associates."}, {"title": "1.3 Clinical Registries and Databases in Healthcare", "content": "Clinical registries play a crucial role in modern healthcare systems by serving as comprehensive repositories of patient\ndata focused on specific conditions or diseases. These sophisticated systems are designed to collect, store, and analyze\ninformation over extended periods, offering invaluable insights into patient care and treatment outcomes. The primary\nfunctions of clinical registries include monitoring and enhancing the quality of care, evaluating the efficacy of various\ntreatments, and providing a solid foundation for research initiatives in targeted medical areas.\nSeveral notable examples of clinical registries have been established across Europe, each contributing significantly\nto their respective fields. The Dutch CONCOR Registry, initiated in 2005, stands as the national registry and DNA\nbank for patients with congenital heart disease in the Netherlands [Vander Velde et al., 2005]. This registry has\nbeen instrumental in advancing understanding and treatment of congenital heart conditions in the country. Similarly,\nSWEDCON, the Swedish National Registry on Congenital Heart Disease, exemplifies another comprehensive approach\nto data collection and analysis in this specialized field [Bodell et al., 2017]. By consolidating information from across\nSweden, SWEDCON has become an essential tool for researchers and clinicians alike, driving improvements in\npatient care and outcomes. In Belgium, the BELCODAC (BELgian COngenital Heart Disease Database combining\nAdministrative and Clinical data) represents a more recent development [Ombelet et al., 2020]. Established in 2020,\nthis registry takes an innovative approach by merging administrative and clinical data, providing a more holistic view of\npatient experiences and treatment efficacy.\nWhile clinical registries focus on specific conditions or diseases, clinical databases cast a wider net, encompassing\nhealth information from a broader range of sources. These databases are not limited to particular conditions but instead\noffer a comprehensive overview of patient health data. A prime example of this broader approach is the hospital\ndatabase, which typically contains a wealth of information on various medical conditions, treatments, and patient\noutcomes within a single healthcare institution or network.\nThe distinction between clinical registries and databases lies in their scope and focus. Registries are tailored to specific\nconditions, allowing for deep, targeted analysis and research. Databases, on the other hand, offer a more expansive\nview of health information, facilitating broader studies and analyses across multiple conditions and patient populations.\nBoth clinical registries and databases are invaluable tools in the healthcare landscape. They not only support day-to-day\npatient care but also drive medical research, inform policy decisions, and contribute to the overall advancement of\nmedical knowledge and practice. As healthcare continues to evolve, these data collection and analysis systems will\nundoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in shaping the future of patient care and medical research."}, {"title": "2 International Classification of Disease System", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 The World Health Organisation and the International Classification of Disease System", "content": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO)\n[Hardiker et al.], plays a crucial role in global healthcare. This standardized coding system enables the collection of\nreliable data for statistical and machine learning applications, facilitating comparisons across different locations and\ntime periods [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2024, Raminani, 2015]. The WHO, representing 194 member\nstates, strives to promote optimal health standards for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race,\ngender, religion, or political beliefs. At its core, the organization upholds the principle that access to affordable and\ncomprehensive healthcare is a fundamental human right.\nHealth is influenced by various factors, including biomedical, genetic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental\ndeterminants. To measure health and wellbeing effectively, common metrics are essential. These include objective\nmeasures like life expectancy and mortality rates, as well as subjective assessments of an individual's perceived\nwell-being. The ICD system serves as the international standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management,\nand clinical purposes. It translates diagnoses and health problems into alphanumeric codes, enabling systematic storage,\nretrieval, and analysis of data. This standardization allows for meaningful comparisons of morbidity and mortality data\nacross hospitals, nations, and time periods. Developed collaboratively between the WHO and international centers, the\nICD system aims to group medical terms reported by physicians, medical examiners, and death certificates for statistical\npurposes. Its broad acceptance and official agreement for use have made it an invaluable tool for international health\nreporting.\nThe ICD system benefits various stakeholders in the healthcare sector. Clinicians, including physicians, nurses,\nand health workers, use it to support patient care decisions. Administrators, such as health information managers,\npolicymakers, and insurers, rely on it for resource allocation and program management. Researchers and epidemiologists\nutilize the data for population health studies and the development of AI-based decision support systems."}, {"title": "2.2 Evolution of the ICD System", "content": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system has a rich history spanning nearly four centuries, Figure\n4. Its roots can be traced back to 17th-century England, where epidemiologist John Graunt recognized the need to\norganize mortality data systematically [Boyce, 2020]. His pioneering work, the London Bills of Mortality, marked the\nfirst statistical study of disease, though it was limited by inconsistent nomenclature and poor data quality.\nThe modern era of disease classification began in the late 19th century with the efforts of William Farr, often regarded\nas the first medical statistician. Farr's 1855 report on the nomenclature and statistical classification of diseases laid\nthe groundwork for a more comprehensive approach, emphasizing the importance of classifying diseases based on the\norganic systems they affect.\nIn 1893, the International Statistical Institute adopted the first edition of the International List of Causes of Death,\nmarking the birth of the modern ICD system. This classification, based on the work of Jacques Bertillon, distinguished\nbetween general diseases and those localized to specific organs or anatomical sites. The system was widely adopted by\nAmerican and European countries, with an agreement to update it approximately every decade.\nThroughout the 20th century, the ICD system underwent significant transformations [Moriyama et al., 2011, Hardiker\net al.]. The sixth revision in 1948 marked a pivotal moment as the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted it as its\nofficial classification system. This version expanded beyond mortality to include morbidity, recognizing the importance\nof non-fatal but chronic conditions.\nSubsequent revisions brought further refinements. The ninth revision introduced a dual classification system reflecting\nboth etiology and manifestation, while the tenth revision implemented an alphanumeric coding structure for greater\nflexibility and expansion.\nThe latest iteration, ICD-11, adopted in 2019 and effective from 2022, represents a significant leap forward [Lancet,\n2019]. Designed for the digital era, it aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance the coding of healthcare quality and\nsafety, and better account for socioeconomic factors influencing health. ICD-11 also simplifies diagnostic descriptions,\nparticularly in mental health."}, {"title": "2.3 Understanding ICD-9 and ICD-10 Coding Systems", "content": null}, {"title": "2.3.1 ICD-9 Coding System", "content": "The ICD-9 coding system consists of a five-digit structure: the first three digits reflect a category, while the last two\ndigits indicate the cause or location. Categories encompass a wide range of classifications, including epidemic diseases,\nconstitutional or general diseases, local diseases arranged by system (e.g., circulatory, respiratory), developmental dis-\neases, and injuries. The World Health Organization mandates a minimum of three-character categories for international\nreporting and comparison, with the fourth digit filled with 'X' when no further subdivision information is available.\nICD-9 categories cover a broad spectrum of medical conditions, starting from epidemic diseases and progressing\nthrough various systemic disorders such as neoplasms, endocrine and metabolic diseases, blood disorders, mental\ndisorders, and diseases of specific organ systems. The classification also includes developmental diseases, injuries, and\npoisoning. The last two categories use letters as the first digit and offer supplemental classifications."}, {"title": "2.3.2 From ICD-9 to ICD-10", "content": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has evolved significantly from its ninth revision (ICD-9) to its\ntenth revision (ICD-10), resulting in substantial changes in disease classification and coding, as it is shown in Figure\n5 and Figure 6. ICD-10 represents a major advancement over ICD-9, offering greater specificity and flexibility in\ndisease classification [Organization, 2004]. While ICD-9 primarily used numeric codes with occasional use of letters E\nand V, ICD-10 adopts an alphanumeric system. The first character in ICD-10 is always alphabetic, followed by two\nnumeric digits for the category. Subsequent characters can be either alphabetic or numeric, allowing for more detailed\nclassification.\nThe structural differences between the two systems are significant as is also shown in Figure 5. ICD-10 contains 21\nchapters compared to ICD-9's 17, providing more comprehensive coverage of health conditions. The expanded structure\nof ICD-10 allows for more precise coding of diseases, injuries, and health status factors. For instance, ICD-10 separates\nsense organ disorders from nervous system disorders and reorganizes injury classifications by anatomical site."}, {"title": "3 Datasets for Research and MIMIC", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 MIMIC Critical Care Dataset: The Impact", "content": "The MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) dataset stands as a cornerstone in healthcare research,\noffering a comprehensive collection of de-identified electronic health records from hospital and intensive care unit\nsettings [Johnson et al., 2018, Bulgarelli et al., 2020, Johnson, 2014]. Developed by the Laboratory for Computational\nPhysiology at MIT, MIMIC has evolved through several iterations. This dataset's significance lies in its volume, quality,\nand representation of real-world hospital data spanning over a decade. It includes a wide range of clinical information\nsuch as lab tests, medical diagnoses, vital signs, and medications, providing researchers with a rich source of complex\nphysiological signals and clinical data.\nThe creation of MIMIC was driven by the need to generate new knowledge from the vast amount of data captured daily\nin intensive care units. By making this de-identified dataset freely accessible under a data use agreement, MIMIC has\nopened up unprecedented opportunities for both academic and industrial research in healthcare and related fields [Saeed\net al., 2002, 2011, Johnson et al., 2016]. MIMIC's impact on research has been substantial and far-reaching. Since\nits initial release, the dataset has garnered thousands of citations, with an exponential growth in its use across various\ndisciplines. While its primary impact has been in medicine and critical care, MIMIC has also significantly influenced\nresearch in computer science and in particular in machine learning and natural language processing. The dataset's\ncomprehensive nature has enabled sophisticated research in deep learning models, clinical decision support systems,\nand big data analytics in healthcare. It has become a valuable resource for developing and validating new algorithms\nand technologies in medical informatics.\nMoreover, MIMIC has set a standard for de-identifying free-text and clinical information, serving as a model for other\nclinical databases. Its public availability has facilitated reproducibility in clinical studies, a crucial aspect of advancing\nmedical research.\nIn conclusion, the MIMIC dataset represents a significant advancement in healthcare data accessibility and has become\nan indispensable tool for researchers across multiple disciplines. Its continued growth and impact underscore its\nimportance in driving innovation in healthcare analytics and clinical research."}, {"title": "3.2 An overview of MIMIC III: Data Linkage", "content": "Designing a database schema to encode the complexity of EHR information presents challenges cite [Moody, 2009].\nThe database must be accessible to doctors and other healthcare providers simultaneously and in a unified manner.\nInteroperability is crucial, involving enhanced quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the healthcare system. Information\nshould be provided in the appropriate format when needed, eliminating unnecessary duplication.\nThe choice of database and its schema architecture influences the effective management of medical data, flexibility,\nscalability, query performance, and interoperability. Non-proprietary standardized models are essential for building\nelectronic health record systems that meet interoperability requirements. MIMIC-III serves as an excellent example in\nthis regard, Figure 7.\nDuring ICU stays, various signals are monitored, including vital signs, waveforms, alarms, fluids, medications, and\nprogression reports from doctors. Hospital data includes billing details, International Classification of Disease codes\nrelated to pathology and symptoms, patient demographics, and other notes concerning medical images and discharge\nsummaries.\nA key step in building the MIMIC-III database was the de-identification process, ensuring compliance with the Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act. All fields related to patient identification were removed, including names,\ntelephone numbers, and addresses. Dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each patient, preserving\nintervals while protecting privacy. This shift maintained seasonality, time of day, and day of the week.

It provides a wealth of\ninformation, including lab examinations, medications, International Classification of Disease coding, and vital signals.\nAs the only freely available database of its kind without major usage restrictions, MIMIC-III represents a valuable\nresource for healthcare research and analysis."}, {"title": "3.3 MIMIC-III as a Relational Database", "content": "This section explores the structure of MIMIC-III as a relational database, with the aim of providing an understanding of\nthe database schema, its basic tables, Figure 7, and navigation methods. The MIMIC-III database contains over 53,000\ndistinct hospital admissions for patients aged 60 years and above, admitted to critical care between 2001 and 2012. It\nalso includes data on more than 7,800 neonates from 2001 to 2008.\nTo effectively extract information from this electronic health record database, it's crucial to understand both the database\nschema and the data sources. Most queries will involve joining information between the basic tables holding data for\npatient admissions in the hospital and ICU stays.\nThe MIMIC-III is a relational database comprises 26 tables, reflecting the inherent hospital information sources. Its\nstructure closely represents the raw data, with only minor adjustments made based on user feedback. These tables\ncan be categorized into four groups: patient tracking, ICU data, hospital data, and dictionary tables. The subject ID\nrefers to a unique patient, the hospital admission ID to a unique hospital admission, and the icustay ID to a unique ICU\nadmission.\nThe core tables of MIMIC-III are the patients table, the admissions table, and the icustays table. These tables form the\nfoundation for extracting various summary statistics. The patients table contains a subject ID identifier linking it to the\nadmissions and ICU tables. It includes information such as date of birth (shifted for patients over 89 years old to protect\nprivacy) and different versions of date of death. The admissions table records every unique hospitalization for each\npatient, including admission and discharge times, type of admission, and diagnosis information. The icustays table\ndocuments every unique ICU stay, with details like care unit, ward locations, and length of stay.\nOther significant tables include the transfers table, which provides information on patient movements within the hospital,\nand the callout table, which records ICU discharge clearance and actual discharge times. The chartevents table is crucial\nfor ICU data, containing all chart event observations for patients. The outputevents table focuses on patient output\nmeasurements.\nWhen working with ICU data, particularly chartevents data, it's essential to consider the dictionary tables. These\nprovide definitions for identifiers, allowing researchers to cross-reference codes against their respective definitions.\nIn the hospital data category, frequently used tables include the labevents table, containing laboratory test results. It's\nworth noting that in cases of disagreement between measurements, labevents should be considered the ground truth. The\n'procedures_icd' and 'diagnoses_icd' tables contain procedure and diagnosis information coded using the International\nStatistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) system.\nResearchers are advised to develop database views and transform data as needed rather than combining tables within\nthe MIMIC data model. This approach maintains the integrity of the original data sources while allowing for flexible\nanalysis."}, {"title": "3.4 MIMIC-III - Descriptive Statistics", "content": "Descriptive statistics serve as a powerful tool in retrospective studies, allowing researchers to overview historic data and\nexplain trends. This section explores how to formulate simple yet effective queries using the MIMIC-III database. It's\nimportant to note that extracting patient data can yield different estimations depending on which table identifier is used,\nunderscoring the necessity of thoroughly understanding the database schema and its data encoding methods.\nDescriptive statistics in MIMIC-III typically involve common queries that provide insights into the distribution of data\nwithin the database. These queries, while relatively simple, offer powerful ways to interrogate the database and generate\nintuitive summary visualizations. They often focus on patient characteristics, intensive care unit utilization, and patient\noutcomes such as mortality.\nWhen estimating the number of patients, multiple approaches can lead to similar but not identical results. For instance,\none can examine the number of distinct patients across care units, unique hospital admissions, or unique admissions\nto ICUs. Each method yields slightly different results, as some patients may have multiple admissions or transfers\nbetween units."}, {"title": "3.5 MIMIC III and Clinical Outcomes: Mortality and Length of Stay", "content": null}, {"title": "3.5.1 Mortality as a clinical outcome", "content": "Mortality is the primary outcome measure employed in prediction studies across critical care and much of medicine.\nAs a reliable indicator (surrogate) of illness severity, clinicians and researchers use this signal to identify trends and\ncorrelations between clinical data and patient outcomes. However, defining mortality is more complex than it might\ninitially appear, particularly when dealing with retrospective data.\nIn the MIMIC database, complications arise from situations such as patients whose consecutive hospitalisations\nultimately result in mortality. While these are considered as distinct hospital admissions, the underlying cause is the\nsame. Mortality data is also prone to selection bias depending on the information source. For instance, hospital mortality\nrecords might not include deaths occurring after discharge to home care, potentially biasing any trained models if\nthere's a routine process for discharging patients with severe illnesses to home care.\nResearchers have some control over how mortality is defined as an outcome. The definition of mortality as death during\nthe first 30 days of admission provides a more robust signal for immediate physiological abnormalities associated with\nthe patient's admission. Conversely, one-year mortality emphasizes chronic illnesses and parallel conditions.\nTo extract mortality numbers for adult ICU patients in MIMIC, Figure 11, we combine the Patients and 'Icustays' tables\nusing the 'subject_id'. We extract the date of death, date of birth, ICU transfer time, and the type of ICU first admitted\nto. A patient is considered to have died in the ICU if their death was registered while in the ICU, or within six hours\nbefore admission or after leaving. This query focuses on patients older than 60 years. Visualizing these results shows\nthat total ICU mortality is about 8.5%, corresponding to approximately 4,565 patients. The medical ICU accounts for\n49% of these deaths, despite having only about 39% of total ICU patients, indicating a higher mortality rate in this unit\ncompared to others.\nFor hospital mortality, we use the hospital_expire_flag in the admissions table, Figure 12. This query combines the ICU\nstays, patients, and admissions tables, filtering for patients older than 16. The results show an increase in total mortality\nto 11.5% when considering hospital-wide deaths, with 50% occurring in the medical ICU."}, {"title": "3.5.2 Length of Stay as a clinical outcome", "content": "Length of stay is another crucial metric, relating to both patient outcomes and resource utilization. To extract this\ndata, we combine the patients, ICU stays, and admissions tables, focusing on patients older than 60. Length of stay is\ncomputed by subtracting the discharge time from the admission time, using the unique hospital admission identifier to\nensure each admission corresponds to only one ICU stay, Figure 13.\nIn conclusion, while mortality and length of stay are the most common outcomes used in predictive models, their\nseemingly simple definitions can be deceptive. Small differences in estimation methods can lead to significantly\ndifferent conclusions. The MIMIC-III database provides a valuable resource for understanding how to form queries and\nextract this critical data, offering researchers a robust platform for developing and refining predictive models in critical\ncare settings."}, {"title": "3.6 MIMIC III: Exploring Patient Data - Vital Signs Extraction for a Single Patient", "content": "Understanding vital signs and medication data for individual patients admitted to intensive care units is crucial, as it\nforms the foundation for extracting clinical variables across multiple patients. These variables can include lab exams,\nsigns and waveforms, as well as doctor reports and prescriptions.\nTo begin exploring patient data, we start by selecting a random ICU stay identifier and its corresponding subject\nidentifier. This allows us to focus on data related to a specific patient and ICU admission. By combining the Admissions,\nICU Stays, and Patients tables, we can create a comprehensive view of the patient's stay, including their unique subject\nidentifier, hospital identifier, admission type, diagnosis, ICU stay identifier, first and last care units, and ICU admission\ntime, Figure 14.\nThe Chartevents table is a key source of data obtained from patients in the ICU. It contains information from both\nCareVue and MetaVision ICU databases, displaying routine vital signs and additional care-relevant information such as\nventilator settings, laboratory values, code status, and mental status. To extract all charted events for a single patient, we\ncombine the Chartevents table with ICU stays and the Dictionary Items table. This allows us to retrieve the time of\ncharted events, the time elapsed since ICU admission, event labels, values, and measurement units.\nSimilarly, the Outputevents table provides crucial data on body fluids and other measurements, such as those from Foley\ncatheters. We use a similar process to extract this data, joining the ICU stays table with the Outputevents table and the\nDictionary table for item verification, Figure 15.\nMedication intake during an ICU stay is recorded in the Inputevents_mv table. By joining this table with ICU stays and\nDictionary Items, we can collect all input events for a single patient's ICU stay, including start and end times, labels,\namounts, measurement units, and administration frequency, Figure 16.\nLab events, which are part of the hospital database rather than the ICU stays database, are summarized in the Labevents\ntable, Figure 17. These events might include measurements such as red blood cell count or magnesium levels. It is\nimportant to note that when there is a discrepancy between Labevents and Chartevents, the Labevents table should be\nconsidered the ground truth.\nVisualizing this extracted data provides a comprehensive view of the patient's condition over time. We can plot various\nmeasurements against the time since ICU admission, typically in hours. This visualization might include the Glasgow\nComa Scale (which measures consciousness level), lab event results, medication administration (both frequent and\nsporadic), and vital signs such as heart rate, O2 saturation, respiratory rate, and output volume. An example is shown at\nFigure 18.\nThese visualizations allow clinicians to understand a patient's progress in the intensive care unit over time. They\nprovide a holistic view of the patient's condition, combining various data points to create a comprehensive picture of\nthe patient's health status and treatment.\nIn summary, extracting data from MIMIC-III for a single patient in a single ICU stay involves examining charted events\n(primarily vital signs), output events (secretions and urine), input events (administered medications), and lab events\n(laboratory tests). This detailed exploration of individual patient data sets the stage for broader analyses across multiple\npatients, enabling researchers and clinicians to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improving patient care\nin intensive care settings."}, {"title": "3.7 MIMIC III and ICD Codes: ICD-9 in MIMIC-III", "content": "The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) serves as the disease classification system used in the\nMIMIC-III database. This section demonstrates how ICD-9 codes can be utilized to extract summary statistics from the\nMIMIC-III database, such as the number and distribution of patients across age groups diagnosed with specific diseases.\nIn MIMIC-III, ICD codes are stored in the Diagnoses_icd table, which can be linked to the Patients and Admissions\ntables via the subject_id. To extract meaningful data, such as patients diagnosed with hypertension who are at least\n30 years old, we need to join these tables, Figure 19. This allows us to find the age of patients based on their date of\nbirth and admission date, filter for age, and then identify patients assigned specific ICD-9 codes related to hypertension.\nVisualizing these results can provide valuable insights. For instance, a histogram of age versus the number of patients\nwith hypertension typically shows a peak between 60 and 80 years old, aligning with clinical expectations.\nAnother useful query involves extracting the distribution of ICD-9 codes across intensive care units in the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. This process involves sorting ICD-9 codes by prevalence, selecting the top five codes, and focusing on patients\nolder than 60 years admitted to an ICU. By combining the patient, admission, ICU stays, and diagnosis tables, we can\nextract information such as patient age, primary diagnosis, ICD-9 code description, and hospital admission identifier,\nFigure 20.\nVisualizing these results across different ICU types reveals interesting patterns, Figure 21. For example, in coronary care\nunits and cardiac surgery recovery units, diseases related to the circulatory system are most prevalent. Medical ICUs\nshow a mix of circulatory and pulmonary diseases, while trauma surgery ICUs, as expected, feature more trauma-related\ndiagnoses. Surgical and medical ICUs tend to display a more diverse profile of ICD codes.\nIt's important to note that a single hospital admission can be assigned multiple ICD-9 codes, reflecting the fact that a\npatient may suffer from several diseases simultaneously upon admission. When querying, attention should be paid to\nthe priority of each ICD-9 code to focus on primary diagnoses.\nIn summary, understanding the structure of ICD-9 codes and their implementation in MIMIC-III allows researchers\nto extract valuable information about disease distribution across age groups and ICU types. This knowledge forms a\ncrucial foundation for more advanced analyses and can provide important insights into patient populations and care\npatterns in intensive care settings."}, {"title": "3.8 Clinical Concepts in MIMIC III", "content": "Clinical concepts in MIMIC III represent definitions and models that provide information about the severity of illness,\nbased on pre-specified sets of clinical variables provided by field experts. These concepts were developed well before\nthe success of machine learning models to quantify the severity of illness or organ failure, predict specific patient events,\nand allow for timely intervention and treatment to improve outcomes and provide better care administration.\nThe development of clinical concepts based on electronic health record databases is challenging and resource-intensive,\nrequiring close collaboration between data scientists and domain experts. MIMIC provides an ideal substrate for\nbuilding clinical concepts collaboratively, bridging the gap between those familiar with the database and clinical\nworkflows, and data scientists or statisticians. These models are precursors to machine learning models, with some\nexploiting techniques such as regression to refine initial expert intuition.\nConcepts in MIMIC include severity of illness scores, organ dysfunction scores, timing of treatment, definition of\nsepsis, and comorbidities. The inclusion of these concepts in the MIMIC repository helps remove barriers for data\nscientists unfamiliar with the clinical environment.\nSeverity of illness scores, such as the Acute Physiology Score (APS) and its variations, have been developed to\nassess patient acuity, particularly at the time of ICU admission. These scores examine disturbances in normal bodily\nfunctioning and typically comprise at least 10 independent components calculated using data from the first 24 hours\nof a patient's stay. The APS, also known as APACHE (Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation), has\nevolved through several versions, incorporating more sophisticated statistical techniques and expanding its applications\nto include risk stratification, mortality prediction, and benchmarking hospital performance.\nThe Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) aimed to streamline the APS by reducing the number of required\nphysiological parameters. Its subsequent versions incorporated data-driven feature selection and expanded the geo-\ngraphical scope of the data used in its development. Organ dysfunction scores, another important concept in MIMIC,\nassess multiple organ systems or focus on specific organs. Examples include the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment\n(SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), and various kidney\ndisease assessment tools. These scores are used for prediction and prognosis, following a similar development pathway\nto illness severity scores.\nThe timing of treatment and sepsis detection are crucial concepts implemented in MIMIC. Sepsis, a life-threatening\norgan dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a major concern in ICUs. MIMIC III provides\ncase selection for sepsis based on ICD-9 codes, enabling the development of early warning systems using high-resolution\nphysiological data and machine learning algorithms.\nComorbidities, referring to chronic conditions that patients have prior to ICU admission, are another important concept\nin MIMIC. The database defines 29 categories based on ICD-9 codes, recognizing the impact of these conditions on a\npatient's probability of surviving significant illness.\nWhile these clinical concepts provide valuable tools for population studies and quality of care assessments, their\npredictive power for individual patient outcomes is limited. This limitation stems partly from variant disease definitions\nand patient population heterogeneity. Advanced machine learning methods promise to deliver better warning systems\nand potentially outperform these traditional clinical concepts. In summary, concepts in MIMIC III implement well-\nknown scores of illness severity and organ dysfunction, providing an ideal substrate for comparing their performance\nand enabling reproducibility. However, these concepts are primarily based on expert knowledge, and their prognostic\npower is limited. With the availability of big data, there is hope that state-of-the-art machine learning approaches will\nprovide personalized outcome predictions, potentially outperforming the clinical concepts developed over the past\nfew decades. This evolution in clinical prediction models represents an exciting frontier in critical care research and\npractice."}, {"title": "3.9 Flowchart of Patient Inclusion: Relation of Catheterization to Mortality - An Example Study", "content": "This section discusses a clinical study that utilizes the MIMIC database to estimate the relationship between mortality\nand an intervention in intensive care unit patients.

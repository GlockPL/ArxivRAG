INTRODUCTION", "content": "In today's interconnected world, ensuring robust network security is imperative. Digital networks underpin critical communication and commerce, making them prime targets for cyber threats. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in safeguarding these networks by monitoring traffic and identifying suspicious activities that could indicate potential intrusions. NIDS can be broadly categorized based on the types of attacks they detect, including Denial of Service (DoS), Probing, User-to-Root (U2R), and Remote-to-Local (R2L) attacks. Traditional rule-based NIDS, while effective in some scenarios, often struggle to adapt to the rapidly evolving threat landscape. They rely heavily on predefined rules and signatures, which can become outdated quickly as new attack vectors emerge. This limitation underscores the necessity for automated, data-driven approaches that can learn and adapt to new threats dynamically. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by enabling the development of systems that can analyze vast amounts of network traffic data, identify patterns, and predict potential intrusions with greater accuracy and efficiency. The primary objective of this study is to harness machine learning algorithms to build a more accurate and efficient Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). By applying advanced data analytics and predictive modeling, we aim to enhance the detection and classification of diverse network intrusions. Utilizing the KDDCUP'99 dataset, a well-established benchmark for evaluating intrusion detection systems, our approach encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND STUDY", "content": "The application of machine learning techniques to NIDS has emerged as a central focus in enhancing network security, with various studies contributing to its advancement. Nguyen et al. [1] provide a foundational survey of prominent frameworks and libraries for large-scale data mining, laying the groundwork for subsequent research by highlighting the essential tools and methodologies for handling complex data. Building on this foundation, Liu et al. [2] address a gap by introducing a hybrid forecasting model that integrates statistical and machine learning methods. This model enhances short-term predictions and demonstrates how combining different techniques can improve accuracy, setting the stage for advanced feature extraction methods.\nIn the realm of feature extraction, Jia et al. [3] advance the field by introducing Caffe, a deep learning framework designed for efficient training and deployment of convolutional neural networks. This addresses the need for improved feature embedding techniques noted in earlier surveys and enhances the capabilities for intrusion detection. Following this, Haji Rahimi and Khashei [4] extend the discussion by reviewing hybrid structures in time series modeling, emphasizing the value of combining multiple forecasting methods. Their work supports and refines the feature extraction methods introduced by Jia et al., providing a more robust approach to handling temporal data. Advancements in specialized neural network architectures are further demonstrated by Xu et al. [5], who propose an intrusion detection system based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). This approach overcomes the limitations of earlier models by enhancing the detection of network anomalies through advanced neural network techniques. Building on this progress, Baratsas et al. [6] develop a hybrid statistical and machine learning forecasting framework for the energy sector. Their work highlights the trend of integrating diverse methods to improve predictions, reflecting the ongoing evolution from basic models to more sophisticated approaches in handling extensive network data, as also addressed by Wang et al. [7] with their distributed ARIMA models for ultra-long time series. Mondal et al.

This supports the effective preparation of data for NIDS and addresses the need for more sophisticated preprocessing methods. Skoutas and Simitsis [9] build on this by proposing the use of semantic web technologies for ETL process design, improving data integration and management, thus refining the ETL processes introduced by Mondal et al.

Data often undergoes reformatting when transferred to its destination application compared to its original source. The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process consists of three primary stages: retrieving the data, transforming it as necessary, and loading it into the intended output container [8]. This approach supports multiple data inputs that can yield various outputs. In this study, we utilized two datasets: the established KDD CUP'99 dataset and a newly developed real-time dataset derived from our network logs. This choice underscores the practical relevance"}, {"title": "1. PRE-PROCESSING", "content": "In the data preprocessing phase, raw data is refined into a format appropriate for computational analysis and machine learning. This process involves various tasks such as data mining and analytical review. Before the datasets were introduced into the model for training, they underwent comprehensive preprocessing. This involved handling missing data, correcting anomalies, normalizing feature scales, and adjusting features to ensure consistency and boost the model's performance."}, {"title": "2. FEATURE EXTRACTION AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES", "content": "Network intrusion detection is typically approached through two fundamental methods: static and dynamic analysis. Static analysis involves evaluating network traffic and related data without executing any programs, focusing on parameters such as protocol types, service types, and traffic flags. In contrast, dynamic analysis monitors and assesses the behavior of network interactions over time. This method provides unique advantages, including the ability to detect complex and obfuscated attack patterns that static analysis might miss. Dynamic analysis offers a broader range of features and various input classifiers, which enhances detection capabilities. Furthermore, hybrid approaches that integrate both static and dynamic analyses improve the accuracy of distinguishing between benign and malicious traffic. For this study, both analysis methods were employed to ensure a comprehensive feature extraction and selection process [10]."}, {"title": "3. CONSTRUCTION OF FEATURE SETS AND METHOD SELECTION", "content": "The goal of feature selection is to reduce the number of attributes used in classification while maintaining accuracy. To achieve this, we have utilized a combination of both dynamic and static analyses for network traffic classification. Among the various methods available, we chose the filter method for feature selection due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. This method employs the Information Gain metric to evaluate the relevance of each attribute. Information Gain measures the amount of information an attribute contributes to distinguishing between classes, as illustrated by equation(1).\nInfo Gain(Class, Attribute)\n= K(Class)\nK(Class Attribute)\n(1)"}, {"title": "4.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "The efficacy of our network intrusion detection methodologies was rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive 10-fold cross-validation framework. This approach allowed for robust performance analysis of various algorithms by measuring essential metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F-measure, all of which are integral to classification tasks in machine learning [13]. For this evaluation, the data instances were categorized into four distinct classes: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN). Recall, defined as Recall = TP/(TP + FN) quantifies the proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified by the model, reflecting its sensitivity. Precision, computed as Precision = TP/(TP + FP), measures the accuracy of the positive predictions, indicating the ratio of true positive identifications relative to all positive predictions. The F-measure, expressed as F = 2 * (Recall * Precision)/(Recall + Precision) synthesizes precision and recall into a single metric, offering a balanced view of the model's performance. Accuracy, calculated as Accuracy = (TP + TN)/Total Samples, represents the overall proportion of correct classifications [14]. This metric provides a high-level overview of the model's performance but should be interpreted alongside precision and recall to ensure a comprehensive assessment."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "Conventional artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, including standard machine learning (ML) algorithms, face limitations in accurately detecting and classifying intricate and novel network intrusion patterns. The shift towards deep learning (DL) introduces a promising new approach, leveraging advanced frameworks distinct from traditional ML. Our experimental analysis of network intrusion detection, integrating both static and dynamic techniques, confirms the superiority of DL algorithms, particularly those using sophisticated permission-based methods. While accuracy metrics between DL and traditional ML are similar, differences arise in implementation complexity and performance. The Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (EnCNN), using a complex backpropagation algorithm, achieves faster processing times and superior accuracy compared to conventional models. Despite ML algorithms showing comparable accuracy with an 80/20 train-test data split, constraints such as high data volume and binary categorization of network traffic remain. An achieved accuracy rate of 96% underscores the efficacy of proposed EnCNN model in precisely managing and classifying network traffic. Future research shall focus on refining these methodologies, addressing data scalability issues, and expanding classification to a broader spectrum of network intrusion types."}]}

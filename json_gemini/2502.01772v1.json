His ability to reinvent himself, both musically and lyrically, has long been recognized as a defining feature of his artistry. Sunstein (2022) describes Dylan's capacity to dishabituate, highlighting his persistent drive to disrupt conventional thought through continual reinvention.\nThis idea aligns with psychological research on habituation and dishabituation, which suggests that human beings become desensitized to repeated stimuli over time, unless those stimuli are altered or recontextualized in ways that restore their impact (Sharot & Sunstein, 2025; Rankin et al., 2009; Groves & Thompson, 1970). Sharot & Sunstein (2024) explores how breaking routine patterns can restore attentional engagement and cognitive flexibility. Dylan's work exemplifies this principle through his frequent stylistic shifts and resistance to genre conventions, ensuring that his audience is continually surprised. His approach aligns with the idea that dishabituation\u2014whether in perception, cognition, or artistic expression\u2014is central to maintaining freshness and engagement.\nBBuilding on these insights, this study employs large language models (LLMs) and network analysis to quantitatively examine Dylan's lyrical evolution. In doing so, the work not only investigates Dylan's shifting use of literal versus metaphorical language, sentiment, and thematic prevalence but also demonstrates a new method to understand the personal evolution of an artist\u2014a methodological approach that can be extended to other cultural figures.\nSpecifically, I investigate whether Dylan's evolving use of literal and metaphorical language, shifts in sentiment, fluctuations in thematic prevalence, and variations in conceptual centrality collectively reflect a deliberate process of dishabituation. To this end, I construct a directed concept-to-concept network from Dylan's lyrics (1962\u20132012), where each node represents a concept (e.g., \u201clove,\u201d \u201croad,\u201d \u201cheaven,\u201d \u201cwar\u201d), and each edge carries annotations on sentiment, expression style (literal or metaphorical), and relationship type."}, {"title": "2 Data and Methods", "content": "I assembled a corpus of Bob Dylan's studio album lyrics from 1962 to 2012, excluding live-only recordings, purely instrumental tracks, and unreleased outtakes. Track titles, album identifiers, and release years were compiled into a structured dataset that formed the basis for further analysis.\nLLM-Based Data Extraction. I used o3-mini-high, a large language model (LLM), to process each song in segmented chunks and extract pairs of related concepts.\u00b9 For each extracted edge, the LLM annotated sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), classified the relationship as literal or metaphorical, and assigned a broad relationship type (correlational or causal). The output was stored in a structured format, linking each concept pair with its corresponding lyric excerpt. Carefully designed prompts ensured that the LLM adhered to a predefined JSON schema, thereby facilitating efficient and consistent processing of the large volume of data. This approach adopts the framework of Garg & Fetzer (2024), which was originally developed to extract knowledge graphs from academic papers, and adapts it for processing song lyrics.\nNetwork Construction and Analysis. From these extracted edges, I constructed a global directed network in which nodes represent normalized concepts (merging synonyms such as \u201ccar\u201d and \u201cautomobile\u201d) and edges capture the relationships identified by the LLM. I computed standard network measures\u2014such as degree and eigenvector centrality-at both the node and song levels. In particular, I used the variance in eigenvector centrality within each song as a proxy for dishabituation; a higher variance indicates that a song blends frequently referenced (mainstream) concepts with those that are rarely mentioned (peripheral).\nThematic Analysis. To examine the evolution of lyrical themes over time, I developed thematic dictionaries for nine categories: Protest/Political, Mythic/Biblical, Movement/Travel, Emotional, Mortality, Love/Romance, Nature, Violence, and Time. These dictionaries were derived from the node list produced by the LLM by querying another instance of the model (03-mini-high) to cluster nodes with more than two connections into thematic groups. For example, the Movement/Travel dictionary includes terms such as \u201croad,\u201d \u201ctrain,\u201d \u201chighway,\u201d \u201cjourney,\u201d and \u201cwander.\u201d Edges were flagged if either the source or sink concept matched a term from a thematic dictionary, allowing me to track the annual prevalence of each theme over time."}, {"title": "3 Data and Methods", "content": "I assembled a corpus of Bob Dylan's studio album lyrics from 1962 to 2012, excluding live-only recordings, purely instrumental tracks, and unreleased outtakes. Track titles, album identifiers, and release years were compiled into a structured dataset that formed the basis for further analysis.\nLLM-Based Data Extraction To extract concept-to-concept relationships from the lyrics, I employed a large language model (03-mini-high) using a comprehensive prompt. In this prompt, the model was assigned the role of an expert assistant tasked with analyzing a song's title, album, album year, and complete lyrics. It was instructed to identify all distinct relationships between concepts\u2014whether explicit or symbolic\u2014and to output a structured JSON object for each relationship.\nEach JSON object includes a claim in the format \u201cA -\u00bf B\" (where A is the source concept and B is the sink concept), along with key annotations: the source and sink concepts, the overall sentiment (categorized as positive, negative, or neutral), the effect size (small, medium, large, or NA), the relationship type (e.g., causal or correlational), and a classification of whether the relationship is expressed literally or metaphorically (with an option for ambiguous or NA).\nAdditionally, the model recorded a snippet of the lyric, a confidence level for the extraction, and categorized both source and sink nodes into predefined types (such as person, object, emotion, place, abstract, event, or other). If no clear relationships were detected, the model returned an empty array. Carefully designed prompts ensured that the LLM adhered to a predefined JSON schema. This extraction framework builds on the methodology described in Garg & Fetzer (2024), originally developed to extract knowledge graphs from academic texts, and adapts it for processing song lyrics.\nEmbedding Standardization. Following extraction, I standardized the free-text node labels using an embedding-based matching approach. I initialized the OpenAIEmbed-dings model with the configuration model=\"text-embedding-3-large\", dimensions=3072 to compute high-dimensional vector embeddings for each node's description. A controlled vocabulary with standardized 1-2 word terms and brief definitions was then used to merge semantically similar labels (e.g., \u201ccar\u201d and \u201cautomobile\u201d) and assign each node to broader categories. Appendix Section A describes the generation of this controlled vocabulary. For each node, its embedding was compared (via cosine similarity) to the embeddings of vocabulary entries, and the term with the highest similarity was"}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Network Visualization. To explore the evolution of conceptual connectivity in Dylan's lyrics, I constructed cumulative networks for two distinct periods: the first 25 years (1962-1986) and the second 25 years (1987\u20132012). In these networks, each node represents a unique concept extracted from the lyrics, and an edge denotes a relationship identified by the LLM. Node degrees were computed to assess centrality, and the top 20 nodes by degree were visualized for each period.\nIn the 1962\u20131986 network (Panel A of Figure 1), highly central nodes include \u201cYou,\u201d \u201cLove,\u201d \u201cMan,\u201d \u201cBeloved,\u201d \u201cWoody Guthrie,\u201d \u201cWind,\u201d \u201cHard Rain,\u201d \u201cPreacher,\u201d \u201cGod,\" and \u201cDeath.\u201d This pattern reflects an early emphasis on personal address, poetic abstraction, historical influence, and existential themes\u2014consistent with Dylan's folk revival and protest-song era. In contrast, the 1987\u20132012 network (Panel B) retains \u201cYou\u201d as the most central node but sees the emergence of \u201cDeparture,\u201d \u201cSinking,\u201d \u201cService,\u201d and \u201cMoney\u201d as prominent concepts. These changes indicate a shift toward themes of transience, broader social commentary, and material critique, aligning with Dylan's later work. (See Figure 1 below.)\nTheme Prevalence and Node-Type Transitions. To gain insight into the structural and emotional properties of Dylan's lyrical network, I first classified the extracted concepts into a set of node types. For example, the person category includes references to individuals (e.g., \"I,\u201d \u201cman,\u201d \u201cwoman\u201d), while emotion covers feelings such as love or grief. The abstract category comprises conceptual ideas (e.g., \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201cmemory\u201d), object includes tangible items (e.g., \u201ctrain,\u201d \u201cflower\u201d), place denotes locations, event captures occurrences (e.g., \u201ckiss,\u201d \u201chard rain,\u201d \u201cdeparture\u201d), and other collects miscellaneous labels. I then aggregated edges by their source and sink node types and computed both the total count and average sentiment (coded as \u20131 for negative, 1 for positive, and 0 for neutral) for each pairing.\nFigure 2 presents an alluvial diagram of these transitions. The width of each flow represents the number of edges linking a given source node type (on the left) to a sink node type (on the right), and the fill color reflects the mean sentiment (darker red indicates more negative sentiment). For instance, the person category emerges as the most frequent source (over 3,350 occurrences), and the abstract category is the most common sink (exceeding 4,280 edges). In contrast, flows such as from event to other exhibit an average sentiment near \u20130.5, indicating a more negative emotional tone. These variations provide a window into the emotional dynamics underlying Dylan's conceptual connections.\nTheme Prevalence Over Time. To capture how core themes evolved across decades, I applied thematic dictionaries for nine categories\u2014Protest/Political, Mythic/Biblical, Movement/Travel, Emotional, Mortality, Love/Romance, Nature, Violence, and Time\u2014to flag lyrical edges whose concepts matched these lists. The faceted plot in Figure 3 displays, for each thematic category, the percentage of edges (as a proportion of all extracted edges) associated with that theme in each year. The x-axis denotes the year, and the LOESS-smoothed curves (on the y-axis, expressed as a percentage) highlight the underlying trends.\nFor example, the \"Protest/Political\" facet, which tracks terms related to political activism, government, revolution, and social justice, exhibits a prominent peak in the early-to-mid 1960s\u2014consistent with Dylan's celebrated protest era\u2014followed by a steep decline. In contrast, the \"Mythic/Biblical\" facet (covering terms such as Cain, Abel, Angels, Heaven, and Hell) shows a marked increase during the late 1970s and early 1980s, aligning with Dylan's born-again period. The \"Movement/Travel\u201d facet remains consistently high, with peaks in the mid-1960s and a notable reemergence in the 1990s, reflecting Dylan's enduring fascination with rootlessness. Similar patterns emerge for the remaining themes, each echoing aspects of Dylan's evolving lyrical concerns.\nLiteral vs. Metaphorical Expression. To quantify the evolution of Dylan's lyrical style, I asked the large language model to classify each extracted concept-to-concept edge as either \"literal,\u201d \u201cmetaphorical,\u201d or \u201cambiguous.\" Out of all classified edges, 3,306 were labeled as literal and 5,646 as metaphorical, while only 163 were ambiguous (and were excluded from further analysis). For example, literal edges include straightforward relationships such as \u201cGod \u2192 you\u201d (from \u201cMay God bless and keep you always\u201d), \u201cMr. Tambourine Man \u2192 song\" (from \"Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me", "Johnny \u2192 medicine\" (from \u201cJohnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine": ".", "ladder \u2192 stars": "from \"May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung\u201d), \u201cevening's empire \u2192 sand", "Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand\"), and \\\"magic, swirling ship \u2192 trip": "from \u201cTake me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The analyses reveal that Dylan's lyrical network evolves significantly over time in both its thematic content and the emotional interactions among its concepts. Figure 2 shows that personal references (e.g., the prevalent person category) often converge toward abstract ideas, while certain transitions (e.g., from event to other) carry a more negative tone. The thematic prevalence analysis indicates that protest/political ideas were dominant in the early 1960s, followed by a mid-career surge in mythic/biblical references and a persistent emphasis on movement motifs throughout his career. In parallel, the analysis of literal versus metaphorical expression reveals a clear shift: literal relationships declined from about 40% in the 1960s and 1970s to under 25% by the 2010s, while metaphorical language increased correspondingly. Moreover, metaphorical edges tend to carry more negative sentiment and exhibit larger effect sizes. Moreover, the measurement of dishabituation via centrality variance shows that the disparity between mainstream (high-centrality) and peripheral (low-centrality) concepts peaked in the 1980s\u2014suggesting that Dylan's lyrics were most eclectic and disruptive during this period\u2014before declining in later decades, possibly indicating a more cohesive thematic approach.\nThe quantitative indicators in the analysis\u2014ranging from the evolving balance of literal and metaphorical expression to shifts in thematic prevalence and network centrality variance\u2014strongly support Sunstein's portrayal of Dylan as an artist who continuously disrupts conventional thought. Notably, the rising reliance on metaphor, the fluctuating prominence of themes such as protest and mythic imagery, and the peak in centrality variance during the 1980s all point to periods of heightened dishabituation in Dylan's work.\nMoreover, the approach presents a new method to understand the personal evolution of an artist by mapping the complex interplay of lyrical concepts over time. Although the method has limitations\u2014such as reliance on LLM interpretations and a focus solely on textual content\u2014it offers a promising framework that can be extended to study other cultural icons and their creative transformations.\nOverall, the study provides a systematic portrait of Dylan's evolving lyrical landscape and reinforces the notion that his art remains a powerful force in challenging routine. Future research could extend these methods to other artists or incorporate additional data layers such as live performance analysis, interviews, or audience reception studies\u2014to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how creative disruption manifests in music."}, {"title": "A Additional Details on Data and Thematic Dictionaries", "content": "In the extraction process, the large language model processed each song's title, album information, and full lyrics to extract pairs of related concepts. Each extracted edge was annotated with information regarding whether the relationship was literal or metaphorical and with its sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). This process yielded thousands of edges spanning Dylan's discography, all stored in a structured format for further analysis.\nTo ensure consistency in our network, I applied a controlled vocabulary strategy. First, I compiled a list of nodes (i.e., the extracted concept labels) and filtered out those with very few connections. I then used the LLM to generate a JSON-formatted dictionary containing standardized 1\u20132 word terms along with brief definitions. This allowed me to merge semantically similar labels (e.g., \u201ccar\u201d and \u201cautomobile\u201d) and assign each normalized node to broader categories such as person, object, place, and emotion. For a similar vector-embedding approach in a different context, see Fetzer et al. (2024) and Garg & Fetzer (2024).\nA similar procedure was used to create thematic dictionaries. I focused on nodes with more than two connections and submitted them to an LLM (chatgpt 03-mini-high) with a prompt designed to cluster these nodes into thematic groups. The model classified the nodes into nine categories: Protest/Political, Mythic/Biblical, Movement/Travel, Emotional, Mortality, Love/Romance, Nature, Violence, and Time. Table 1 below presents sample terms for each thematic category.\nAfter generating these dictionaries, I flagged each edge in the dataset if its source or sink concept matched any term from the appropriate dictionary. I then computed, for each year, the percentage of edges flagged for each theme, which enabled the faceted thematic analysis presented in Figure 3 of the main text."}]}

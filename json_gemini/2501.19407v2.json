This study is the first\nof its kind to investigate whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making,\nfocusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations, leadership\nappointments, and loan approvals. Using 72,000 evaluations of 600 surnames from the United\nStates and Thailand two countries with distinct sociohistorical contexts and surname\nconventions\u2014we classify names into four categories: \u201cRich,\u201d\u201cLegacy,\u201d\u201cNormal,\u201d and\nphonetically similar \u201cVariant\u201d groups. Our findings show that elite surnames consistently increase\nAI-generated perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, which in turn influence AI-driven\ndecisions in high-stakes contexts.

While providing\nobjective qualifications alongside surnames mitigates most of these biases, it does not eliminate\nthem entirely especially in contexts where candidate credentials are low.

With the rise of AI-driven recruitment, these biases are assuming new forms.\nAlgorithms trained on historical data risk replicating or even amplifying existing inequalities, as\nexemplified by Amazon's discontinued hiring tool that systematically disadvantaged women (4\u2013\n6). Such evidence has intensified scrutiny over the subtle cues-both explicit and implicit\u2014that\nmay trigger biased responses in hiring and other high-stakes decisions. Although attention to race\nand gender bias in algorithmic systems is increasing (7\u20139), little research has focused on surname\nbias. Surnames can serve as covert proxies for inherited socioeconomic status, enabling class-\nbased discrimination to persist even in AI systems designed to be race- and gender-neutral. This\nsuggests that eliminating explicit demographic markers does not necessarily eliminate bias, as\nsurnames may continue to encode and perpetuate historical inequalities. Given these concerns, a\nsystematic investigation into surname bias is critical for understanding and mitigating the\nmultifaceted dimensions of discrimination in AI-driven decision making.\nA substantial body of research has examined discrimination based on first names, as demonstrated\nby numerous field experiments on labor market bias (2, 10\u201312). In contrast, bias linked to surnames\nhas received relatively little attention despite its unique and far-reaching implications. Unlike first\nnames-which individuals can often change relatively easily-surnames are typically inherited or\nacquired through marriage. As enduring markers of lineage, surnames encapsulate signals of\nwealth, privilege, and social status, reflecting historical advantages that persist across generations\n(13-15). Economic historian Gregory Clark, for example, has shown that tracking surnames over\ntime reveals a disproportionate representation of certain elite surnames among the wealthiest and\nmost influential groups, even amid significant social and economic change (13, 14). Clark argues\nthat surnames not only serve as proxies for inherited advantages but also signal a family's legacy\nof cultural and social capital-non-economic assets such as education, skills, knowledge, values,\nand even tastes and preferences\u2014that families acquire and transmit, along with social capital\u2014\nthe networks of relationships and connections built over time\u2014and cumulative advantages derived\nfrom innate abilities, acquired behaviors, or even genetic predispositions, all of which are passed\ndown through generations.."}, {"title": "", "content": "These historical insights have clear implications for contemporary AI-driven decision-making.\nLike education in signaling models (16), where people use someone's qualification as a signal for\ntheir unobserved abilities and intelligence in the job market, elite surnames signal a privileged\nfamily background and access to greater resources. As a result, individuals bearing such surnames\nmay be perceived as highly capable and intelligent, receiving preferential treatment in professional\nand social settings. This signaling effect reinforces cycles of advantage, as societal recognition and\nvalidation of elite surnames further entrench intergenerational benefits. Yet, despite these\nsignificant implications, the extent to which status-laden surnames influence outcomes in AI-\ndriven decision-making processes remains poorly understood especially given mounting\nconcerns that algorithmic models may encode and amplify historical biases.\nThis study investigates whether and how surnames\u2014often presumed impartial-trigger\ndiscrimination in AI-based decision-making. Our comprehensive approach yielded 72,000\nevaluations generated from 600 surnames assessed across 10 dimensions with 3 evaluations per\ndimension and 4 candidate profile configurations (good, medium, bad, and retracted). We\nmeasured the effects of these surnames on outcomes in key domains, including hiring\nrecommendations, leadership appointments, and loan approvals, using GPT-4o-mini, the leading\nlanguage model in 2024. Data collection was performed via a standardized API-based protocol to\nensure rigor and reproducibility.\nTo broaden the analytical scope, we drew on surnames from two distinct national contexts. To\nensure a broad and comparative perspective, we draw on surnames from the United States (N=300)\nand Thailand (N=300)\u2014two countries with significant socioeconomic diversity, distinct historical\ncontexts of intergenerational inequality, and documented institutional discrimination linked to\nfamily names (17\u201322).

In our study, in both the\nU.S. and Thailand, legacy and rich surname categories emerge as robust predictors of perceived\nwealth. In Thailand, legacy surnames are associated with a 0.674-point increase in perceived\nwealth (p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.325, 1.022]) relative to common surnames, while rich surnames\ncorrespond to a 0.893-point increase (p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.549, 1.236]).

This difference may be\nattributed to Thailand's unique surname law, which mandates that each family has a distinct\nsurname, reinforcing strong associations with status, lineage, and societal standing. In the U.S., by\ncontrast, the widespread sharing of surnames among unrelated families weakens these\nassociations, potentially reducing their influence on algorithmic decision-making.\nOur findings have significant societal and ethical implications. First, the ability of AI to assign\nvalue and make decisions based on surnames introduces a risk of perpetuating structural inequality\nwithin institutions, particularly in contexts involving leadership positions. This suggests the\npresence of an implicit algorithmic \u201cceiling\u201d for individuals with more common surnames,\npotentially restricting their opportunities for advancement or recognition in critical organizational\nroles from the start.\nSecond, while the potential for individuals to strategically modify their surnames to closely\nresemble those of wealthy and influential families might be seen by some to \u201clevel the playing\nfield,\" it raises significant ethical concerns related to authenticity and fairness, particularly when\nsuch individuals lack the merit required for the roles they are pursuing.\nThird, our findings highlight how AI systems' reliance on surnames as proxies for perceived\nintelligence and socioeconomic status could further entrench intergenerational inequality\nstemming from the \u201cbirth lottery\u201d\u2014the arbitrary advantage or disadvantage conferred by one's\nfamily lineage (25). Additionally, it may reinforce a narrative in which inherited status is perceived\nas a legitimate indicator of individual merit, fostering the belief that intergenerational inequality is\nboth natural and acceptable (26, 27). This has profound implications for social mobility, as\nindividuals without elite lineage may face systemic barriers to advancement, even in contexts\nexplicitly designed to be meritocratic (31, 32). By embedding historical advantages into decision-\nmaking processes, AI risks institutionalizing disparities that erode equal opportunity and limit\nupward mobility.\nFourth, it is possible that surname-based biases that influence hiring recommendations or\nleadership selection can cascade into other aspects of institutional operations, such as mentorship\nopportunities, salary decisions, or performance evaluations.

To ensure that technological progress advances broader societal goals of fairness\nand inclusivity, AI systems must be intentionally designed to challenge and dismantle structural\ninequalities rather than inadvertently perpetuate them.\nOur findings on surname bias in AI decision-making also have significant practical implications\nbeyond academic significance. For instance, despite existing laws and policies aimed at promoting\nequity for underrepresented groups\u2014such as affirmative action and diversity, equity, and inclusion\n(DEI) initiatives\u2014there are no explicit legal safeguards against discrimination based on family\nlineage as inferred from surnames. If AI-driven or human decision-making systematically exclude\nindividuals due to their surnames, this regulatory gap may warrant new policies that address such\nbiases. Recognising surname bias could help policymakers refine anti-discrimination laws, such\nas the European Union's AI Act, and develop clearer guidelines for AI accountability to ensure\nfairness in automated decision-making systems. Additionally, addressing surname bias is also\ncrucial for organisations that integrate AI into their recruitment and decision-making processes.\nAl-driven decisions in hiring, lending, and public services could inadvertently favor or\ndisadvantage individuals based on surname associations, potentially exposing companies to legal\nchallenges.

Several factors\ncould contribute to this bias. First, historical training data may embed long-standing social biases,\nassociating certain surnames with higher success rates and prompting algorithms to reinforce these\npatterns (28, 29). Second, the socioeconomic advantages linked to elite surnames\u2014such as access\nto prestigious education or influential networks\u2014may further skew AI-driven decisions.

For example, the\nAl systems evaluated, such as ChatGPT, relied on specific training data and algorithms, which\nmay not fully capture the variability in models and methods currently in use. However, other\nstudies have provided evidence that existing AI systems\u2014e.g., GPT4, Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and\nGPT-3.5-tend to exhibit the same human biases (30). In addition, while the choice of real-world\noutcomes for which AI had to make judgments\u2014such as hiring recommendations, loan approvals,\nand leadership appointments may appear arbitrary, they were chosen deliberately due to their\nsocietal significance and their alignment with domains where AI-driven decisions are increasingly\nprevalent. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that other domains with a history of systemic inequality,\nsuch as university admissions and access to affordable housing, could have been considered as\nwell.\nAnother potential objection to our findings is that Al's reliance on rich and legacy surnames as\nproxies for intelligence stems from the empirical association between wealth and human capital\naccumulation\u2014where individuals from affluent backgrounds are more likely to have had greater\naccess to education and skill development, making them statistically more intelligent than others.\nFrom this perspective, the observed bias may not simply be a form of taste-based discrimination\nbut rather an instance of statistical discrimination.\nWhile this argument may hold in some cases, our evidence suggests that affluent and prestigious\nsurnames exert an independent influence"}]}

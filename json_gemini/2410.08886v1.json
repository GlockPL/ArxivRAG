The paper inspects the utilization of powerful predictive modeling in the assessment and prediction of loan application approval or rejection. In this project, the central dataset contains 148,670 rows and 37 columns, each of which represents meaningful factors impacting loan choices. This paper investigates the powers of prediction for five famous machine learning algorithms: AdaBoosting, GaussianNB, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and SVM. The target attribute, therefore, has binary classes of \"Approved\" and \"Denied.\" [1] Lightly sophisticated machine learning models are very important in managing risk and complying with regulations in the context of commercial banks.

Related Works", "content": "The literature review situates our work on \"Bank Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques\" within the greater corpus of knowledge at the nexus of machine learning and financial decision-making. Numerous scholars have examined the use of machine learning algorithms in related domains, shedding light on several aspects that are crucial to our study. We have reviewed a few recent studies, and the following is an analysis of those findings:\nArutjothi [4] Using machine learning techniques, presented a credit rating model for forecasting loan statuses in commercial banks. With Min-Max normalization and the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, the model successfully classifies credit applicants with an accuracy of 75.08%. By using this strategy, it becomes easier to distinguish between legitimate clients and defaulters with more accuracy.\nNazim [5] Overcame the challenge of accurately identifying loan applicants in the banking industry by using a novel machine learning (ML) technique. The process involves preparing the data and balancing it using many models, including deep learning and Extra Trees. When it comes to forecasting bank loan defaulters, Extra Trees excels, while an ensemble voting model that combines the top three ML models outperforms with an amazing 87.26% accuracy. The desktop application is easy to use and may help financial institutions and applicants alike by streamlining and optimizing the loan approval process.\nSingh, Vishal [6] Has focused on how technology is changing the face of financial industries and human life. This research addresses the problem of limited funds vs. large sum of loan applications by estimating approval of loan using techniques of machine learning: Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines based on previous data. The model is thereby capable of helping banks make emphatic decisions with a very good rendering of 78.785% on accuracy, enhancing loan recovery, and smoothing the entire banking process.\nDasariet [7] focused on improving the forecast accuracy for loan eligibility, which is very important for producing bank revenue. Therefore, by merging several machine learning algorithms through some ensemble techniques, such as bagging and voting classification algorithms, the proposed model increases accuracy from the level of 80% to 94%. Its main objective was to identify people who were qualified for a loan and enable quick identification of those qualified for loans, accelerate processes, save the need for more employees, and give a rise that was very remarkable in the accuracy of predictions when compared to the existing models.\nLai [8] utilized machine learning with big data in the lending industry, where defaults are one of the great concerns. Among them, the AdaBoost model performs the best in predicting loan defaults with astonishing accuracy of 100%, using a dataset from a reputed multinational bank. This outperformed some previous works done based on models such as XGBoost, random forest, k nearest neighbors, and multilayer perceptrons showing enormous potential of machine learning techniques in improvement of risk prediction within the financial sector.\nTurkson [9] Researched the use of machine learning in predicting financial capacity in order to handle the challenge of determining important risk variables for loan acceptance. When actual bank credit data was analysed, a variety of machine learning algorithms were used, and all of them were able to predict credit outcomes with above 80% accuracy. There is little difference when comparing the study's estimated accuracy of the most important features to the whole feature set. The study's output is a prediction model that gives the banking sector a useful tool by precisely identifying a customer's credit worthiness based on these crucial factors.\nNureni [10] studied how to forecast loan defaults in order to maximize bank profitability; this is very important for lowering non-performing assets. In the research, with \"Kaggle\" datasets, the work analyzed eight algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression was the most accurate, with an accuracy of 83.24% and 78.13% across the datasets. This is followed by Naive Bayes with 82.16% and 77.34% accuracy.

A proposed approach toward increasing the accuracy in selecting qualified applicants is a combination of machine learning (ML) models and ensemble learning. Using the Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and KNN algorithms, the work scored a very impressive accuracy of 83.73%, out of which the Naive Bayes scored the highest. This method not only expedites the loan approval process, but it also saves time in preparation by applicants and bank workers by reducing the sanction time manifold.\nGogas [12] Proposed a machine-learning-based prediction model for bank failures that uses a linear decision boundary to distinguish between solvent and failed banks. The model, powered by support vector machines, achieves an outstanding 99.22% total predicting accuracy using a sample of 1443 US institutions. The two-step feature selection procedure improves the model's efficacy, identifying it as an alternative stress-testing tool with predicted accuracy that meets the established Ohlson's score.\nNatasha [13] focused on credit risk classification, which is critical in the reduction of defaults and maintaining financial stability. DNN received the best performance in this study when evaluating various parametric and non-parametric methods that include Discriminant Analysis, Binary Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Deep Neural Network. The optimal neuron numbers in the first and second layers resulted in an AUC of 0.638 by DNN on the test dataset and proved to be useful for the detection of customers for loans, reducing credit risk.\nSayjadah [14] studied loan default prediction algorithms to find out the solution for the increasing rate of credit card loan defaults in the banking industry. Random forest outperforms algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest in accuracy and area under the curve. The results from the model show that the random forest is effective in selecting important indicators in credit risk assessment among users of credit cards, hence giving an accuracy of 82% and an area under the curve of 77%.\nAppiahene [15] drove a discussion on the efficiency and performance of Ghanaian banks in the aftereffect of the 2015-2018 financial crisis. The present study evaluates 444 bank branches through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and three techniques related to machine learning: The DT, along with its C5.0 algorithm, comes up as the best predictive model to predict a hold-out sample dataset with an accuracy of 100%.

Training six different models, including a Random Forest and Logistic Regression, on a historical dataset from Kaggle yielded good accuracy. The highest score came from the Random Forest method at 95.55%, while the lowest score was obtained by Logistic Regression at 80%. These models outperform the existing literature on precision-recall and accuracy, demonstrating the capability of machine learning in bringing further improvements in speed, efficacy, and accuracy to the loan approval process.\nKrasovytskyi, Danylo [22] Shows that Random Forest and XGBoost effectively predict mortgage defaults, with real GDP growth and the Debt-Service-to-Income ratio as key predictors.

The reliance on historical data might not account for rapid economic shifts or changing borrower behavior, making it less adaptable in real-time scenarios. The possibility of missing variables, like macroeconomic indicators or behavioral patterns, also limits the model's comprehensiveness. Furthermore, scalability across various types of financial institutions, which may have different needs, was not fully addressed.\nImportantly, the research did not deeply explore the fairness of algorithmic decisions, especially regarding marginalized groups, which is essential in ensuring just loan approval processes. The study advocates for a balanced approach as financial institutions adopt more advanced technologies, suggesting that accuracy, fairness, and ethical practices must all be prioritized.

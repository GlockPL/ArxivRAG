These models, characterized by\ntheir extensive parameter counts and trained on vast corpora, have demonstrated remarkable profi-\nciency in tasks such as text generation, translation, and comprehension. Despite these achievements,\nLLMs encounter several challenges that impede their optimal performance and broader applicability.\nOne primary concern pertains to the models' tendency to produce outputs that, while syntactically\ncorrect, lack semantic depth or coherence. This issue arises from the models' reliance on surface-\nlevel patterns in data, leading to responses that may be contextually inappropriate or factually in-\naccurate. Additionally, the substantial computational resources required for training and deploying\nLLMs pose significant barriers, limiting accessibility for many researchers and organizations.\nAnother critical challenge involves the models' sensitivity to input variations. Minor alterations in\nphrasing or context can result in disproportionately varied outputs, indicating a lack of robustness.\nThis variability undermines the reliability of LLMs in applications where consistent and accurate\nlanguage understanding is essential.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism\n(CASRM).

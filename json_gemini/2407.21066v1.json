Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the field of audio and speech processing, self-supervised learning using large-scale unlabeled datasets has become a leading approach for extracting generic representations from speech data [1]\u2013[7]. The main idea of this approach is to leverage the inherent structures and patterns within the speech data to train models via representation learning loss such as contrastive loss [8]\u2013[11]. This significantly reduces the need for manually labeled data, making model training more scalable and efficient. Examples of models trained by self-supervised learning, which we refer to as self-supervised models, include wav2vec [1], [2], HuBERT [4], and WavLM [6]. These models have demonstrated the ability to extract task-independent features with transformer-based architectures.\nIn recent years, the range of speech processing tasks that can be covered by self-supervised models has been steadily expanding beyond automatic speech recognition. For example, a number of studies have proposed methods that utilize speech embeddings extracted from self-supervised models for discriminative tasks such as speaker verification [12]-[15] and speech emotion recognition [16], [17]. Some pioneering studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-supervised models in addressing more complex and generative tasks. For example, spoken question answering is an important line of research focused on developing models capable of understanding and responding to questions posed in natural spoken language, where recent studies leverage self-supervised models [18]-[23]. It has also been demonstrated that self-supervised models can perform voice conversion effectively and efficiently by integrating a decoder and a vocoder [24]\u2013[28]. These studies highlight the potential of self-supervised models across various speech tasks.\nTo apply self-supervised models to downstream tasks, fine-tuning on task-specific labeled datasets is often required. This process enables the models to adapt and specialize in specific tasks, leading to excellent results not only in speech recognition but also in various speech tasks. However, one limitation is the substantial number of parameters involved. When fine-tuning is conducted for each downstream task, multiple models must be stored, one for each task. This can lead to storage inefficiencies in real-world application settings, such as when each user wants to fine-tune the model with their private data and task.\nA parameter-efficient method for adapting self-supervised models to various downstream tasks is thus desirable. Learning task-specific downstream head modules, such as a linear classification head, with frozen self-supervised models is an efficient solution; however, it often degrades the final performance compared to that obtained by fine-tuning all parameters because the optimal features can differ substantially depending on each task. For instance, linguistic features that include phoneme information are crucial for speech recognition, whereas non-linguistic features are crucial for speaker verification.\nRecently, learning with adapter modules that can be inserted into the intermediate encoder layers of a frozen model has emerged as a promising approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The first adapter tuning method [29] was proposed for BERT [30] in the field of natural language processing, where two adapter modules are inserted into each encoder layer of BERT. Each adapter module consists of two linear layers with an activation between them and a skip connection. This approach requires fewer parameters (the frozen parameters are shared among all downstream tasks) without degrading accuracy. A number of follow-up studies have used adapters for various natural language processing tasks [31]\u2013[33].\nFor speech recognition, Kannan et al. [34] integrated adapter modules into recurrent neural network transducers. Hou et al. [35], [36] proposed the use of adapters for cross-lingual speech adaptation. Winata et al. [37] proposed the adapt-and-"}, {"title": "II. CONVENTIONAL METHODS", "content": "The goal of self-supervised learning is to learn features from unlabeled data by leveraging the intrinsic structure of the data itself. This approach involves creating tasks where the input data serve as their own supervision data. Below, we review five self-supervised models for speech signal processing that we use as the backbones in our experiments.\n1) wav2vec2.0 [2]: This model consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder followed by multiple transformer encoders. The CNN encoder extracts low-level features from raw waveform inputs via a sequence of several blocks, each with a temporal convolution layer, layer normalization [47], and a Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) [48] activation function. The transformer encoders apply attention modules to the extracted features. We employ the wav2vec2.0 base model trained on the Librispeech [49] corpus, which contains 960 hours of speech with contrastive loss and diversity loss. The number of parameters is 95.04M.\n2) HuBERT [4]: This model aims to discover hidden acoustic units to provide frame-level targets in self-supervised learning using masked prediction. The architecture consists of a CNN encoder and transformer encoders, similar to wav2vec2.0. We employ the HuBERT base model, which is trained on the Librispeech corpus with masked prediction loss using the acoustic unit discovery module. The number of parameters is 94.68M.\n3) ContentVec [7]: This model aims to disentangle speaker variations during self-supervised learning by incorporating three disentanglement mechanisms into HuBERT, namely disentanglement in teachers, students, and speaker conditioning. The architecture is the same as that of the HuBERT base model. We employ the ContentVec model trained on Librispeech.\n4) WavLM [6]: This model is a self-supervised model for addressing various downstream speech tasks. The architecture consists of a CNN encoder and transformer-based encoders using gated relative position bias [50]. We employ two models, namely WavLM Base and WavLM Base+. The former model is trained on Librispeech. The latter model, which we refer to as WavLM+, is trained on a union set of Librispeech, GigaSpeech [51], and VoxPopuli [52], which contains a total of 96k hours of audio data. The number of parameters for each model is 94.70M."}, {"title": "B. Fine-tuning methods", "content": "Given a self-supervised model, the goal of fine-tuning is to adjust the model parameters for a specific downstream task,"}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED ADAPTER ARCHITECTURE", "content": "This section presents ELP-adapter tuning, a novel fine-tuning method for various speech processing tasks. Given a frozen self-supervised model (e.g., WavLM), ELP-adapter tuning incorporates three types of adapter, namely E-adapters, L-adapters, and a P-adapter, into the model, as shown in Fig. 2. The E-adapters $g_e^{(1)}$ are integrated into the transformer-based encoder layers. This helps to obtain fine-grained linguistic representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters $g_l^{(1)}$ create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head. This helps to extract features from intermediate encoder layers; such features are effective for emotion recognition and speaker verification. The P-adapter $g_p$ appends learnable embeddings to input tokens to further enhance training effectiveness and efficiency.\nThe amount of storage required to store fine-tuned models is $O(N + K(M + H))$, where $K$ is the number of downstream tasks and $N$, $M$, and $H$ are the numbers of parameters of the frozen backbone model, learnable adapter modules, and downstream head, respectively. Compared to full fine-tuning, for which the amount of storage required is $O(K(N + H))$, ELP-adapter is more efficient when $M \\ll N$. In practice, we need $M$ to be roughly 10 percent of $N$ to achieve performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning. For example, with the WavLM backbone and our ELP-adapter modules, we have $N = 94.7M$ and $M = 9.52M$. In the following, we provide detailed descriptions of each adapter module and downstream head."}, {"title": "A.

Compared to the conventional efficient adapter tuning in Eqs. (12) and (11), the adapter module for MHSA is omitted. When the E-adapters are used with the L-adapters presented in the next subsection, this omission does not lead to a decrease in performance and improves parameter efficiency.

Further, (E) incorporates a learnable fully connected layer into each L-adapter. This significantly the perfomance of ASR, ASV and ER. Although fully connected layers increase the number of learnable parameters to 4.75M, this is considered the minimum requirement. Configurations (F), (G), and (H) add activation function,"}, {"title": "C. Limitations", "content": "When a large amount of data is available for fine-tuning, it is advantageous to update more parameters. Consequently, ELP-adapter tuning does not always outperform full fine-tuning. To analyze this limitation, we compared full fine-tuning and ELP-adapter tuning using larger training data for ASR and ASV with the WavLM+ backbone.\nFor ASR, the train-clean-100 set of Libri"}]}

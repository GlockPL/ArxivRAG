It uses real-world ethical dilemmas with clear solutions designed by medical professionals, offering a more realistic alternative to annotation-based benchmarks. TRIAGE incorporates various prompting styles to evaluate model performance across different contexts. Most models consistently outperformed random guessing, suggesting LLMs may support decision-making in triage scenarios. Neutral or factual scenario formulations led to the best performance, unlike other ME benchmarks where ethical reminders improved outcomes. Adversarial prompts reduced performance but not to random guessing levels. Open-source models made more morally serious errors, and general capability overall predicted better performance.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "To ensure that advanced AI systems are safe, they must act reliably following human values. Machine ethics (ME) benchmarks can indicate a system's value alignment and moral understanding [Sun et al., 2024, Hendrycks et al., 2023]. ME benchmarks help to establish industry safety standards, enable comparative analysis of AI models, and aid decision-makers in evaluating model capabilities, safety, and trustworthiness [Alzahrani et al., 2024]. Previous studies on ME benchmarking have shown that state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) exhibit a basic understanding of moral reasoning, with their ethical decision-making abilities improving alongside general advancements in capability [Sun et al., 2024, Pan et al., 2023]. However, these evaluations have primarily been conducted using artificial or fictional scenarios [Pan et al., 2023, Hendrycks et al., 2023], and the proposed solutions often rely on annotations from crowdworkers, which often suffer from low inter-rater agreement. Additionally, many existing ME benchmarks fail to account for the diversity of cultural values, limiting the generalizability of the results.\nTo address these issues, we introduce TRIAGE-a new ME ethics benchmark that builds on existing medical triage models. Triage is the process of sorting patients according to the severity of their injuries to save as many lives as possible with the limited resources available. Different triage models across nations all share a core principle: prioritizing the greater good, even at the cost of individual needs. Triage models provide frameworks that physicians from diverse nations and cultures use to navigate the ethically complex decision of which patient to prioritize in emergency situations such as"}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "We designed TRIAGE using the START and jumpSTART medical triage models [EMSC, 2016, Rajagopal, AB et al., 2020], which categorize patients into four groups (see Figure 1). The benchmark includes realistic patient scenarios and the exact questions and gold-standard solutions used to train medical professionals for mass casualty incidents.\nAfter evaluating the models' ability to assign patients to the correct triage groups across various ethical contexts, we classify incorrect responses into distinct error categories. These include overcaring errors, where excess resources are allocated to a patient; undercaring errors, where insufficient resources are provided; and instruction-following errors, which occur when the model fails to follow the specified response format or offers no answer at all."}, {"title": "2.2 Experiments", "content": "We tested six models overall: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT-3.5), Mistral-7B-Instruct (Mistral), Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct-v0.1 (Mixtral), Claude 3 Opus, and Claude 3 Haiku. The GPT and Claude models were accessed through their respective APIs, while the Mistral and Mixtral models were accessed via HuggingFace [Mistral, AI, 2023b,a]. The temperature for all models was set to zero.\nTo run the experiments with the open-source models, we need one A100 80GB GPU to run our experiments which takes approximately five hours.\nWe evaluated these models under different conditions by varying two key factors: the type of prompt and the description or syntax used for the triage task."}, {"title": "Syntax/Triage category description", "content": "We further varied the way we presented the different triage categories to the models. The original neutral triage descriptions from the real training questions [EMSC, 2016, Rajagopal, AB et al., 2020] were compared to two alternatives: action-oriented, highlighting specific actions (e.g., providing palliative care), and outcome-oriented, focusing on consequences (e.g., patient's life not saved)."}, {"title": "2.3 Analysis", "content": "We validated our benchmark by evaluating its ability to detect significant differences between models.

Our mixed logistic regression model (equation 1) included random intercepts for each question and syntax type, and random slopes for each model per question.

Ethics prompts emphasiz-ing specific moral principles led to worse performance compared to the baseline without additional prompts.\nAdversarial prompts significantly decreased model performance, with models tending to perform worst under such prompts.\nMore capable models generally perform better on our benchmark, but not in all contexts. For instance, as shown in Figures 3b and 4d, GPT-4's performance sometimes drops below Claude Haiku's, with no significant differences between them.\nProprietary models made mostly overcaring errors, while open-source models made mostly undercaring errors, suggesting open-source models make more morally grave mistakes."}, {"title": "3.1 Relative Performance", "content": "We tested all models with n=87 questions. This resulted in 3x5x87 answers per model. Sometimes models do not answer in the right format, leading to an effectively lower number of responses. Figures 2 and 3 show the relative ordering of models in the best (no ethics prompt) and worst (doctor jailbreaking prompt) conditions, with different model rankings in each. Notably, Claude Opus and Claude Haiku outperform GPT-4 under the doctor jailbreaking prompt. We assessed the significance of these rankings using five pairwise mixed logistic regression models (see Figure 4), with detailed results in Appendix E.\nSignificance tests indicated that GPT-3.5 performs overall significantly better than Mistral (Estimate = 1.407, 95%CI {2.203;0.611}, p = 0.001).

We found that all proprietary models made substantially more overcaring errors than undercaring ones, consistently assigning patients to more resource-intensive triage categories. This trend is likely due to a large amount of safety fine-tuning these models go through. Interestingly, the open-source models we tested exhibited the opposite pattern, committing more undercaring errors. Figure 5b shows the misclassification pattern per prompt. We see that per prompt, the overcaring errors are greater than the undercaring errors."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "In this work, we demonstrated the ability of LLMs to solve ethical dilemmas in the medical context. All models, except Mistral, consistently outperformed random guessing on the TRIAGE benchmark. This indicates that models do indeed have a good understanding of moral values as suggested by Hendrycks et al. [2023] and that they are able to make sound moral decisions in the medical context.\nTRIAGE offers a more realistic alternative to other benchmarks, such as Hendrycks et al. [2023] and Pan et al. [2023], which primarily rely on fabricated or fictional scenarios created by researchers or drawn from fantasy stories. In contrast, TRIAGE focuses on real-world ethical dilemmas that humans have actually faced, providing a more structured and relevant approach to scenario selection. By identifying significant differences between models, we demonstrate that TRIAGE is a viable alternative to traditional annotation-based methods for designing ME benchmarks.\nIn addition to featuring real-world decision-making scenarios, a key advantage of TRIAGE is its focus on assessing explicit ethics. The benchmark requires models to explicitly choose an action in each scenario, which is crucial because a model may possess implicit knowledge of human values but still prioritize other values in its actions [Sun et al., 2024].\nGiven the safety focus of our ME benchmarks, worst-case performance may be more critical than best-case performance. To capture a broader range of potential model behaviors, we included multiple syntax variations, jailbreaking attacks, and ethical contexts. All models, except Mistral, consistently outperformed random guessing, even in their worst-performing condition. However, our findings show that the relative ranking of models can vary between best- and worst-case performances. The best-case rankings (see Figures 2 and 3a) align with expectations based on MT-Bench ratings. Interestingly, Claude 3 Haiku, which scored lower on MT-Bench than GPT-4, outperformed it in some ethical dilemma scenarios. One possible explanation is that more capable models like GPT-4 may experience \"competing objectives\" [Wei et al., 2023], where their enhanced instruction-following abilities conflict with safety training. However, Claude 3 Opus, considered as capable as GPT-4, did not show the same performance drop, suggesting that model architecture and training practices may be more predictive of ethical decision-making than general capability.\nOur findings support three key hypotheses from Sun et al. [2024]: (1) trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are often positively correlated, (2) proprietary LLMs tend to outperform open-source LLMs on ME benchmarks, and (3) proprietary LLMs are often overly calibrated toward trustworthiness. To explore this further, we analyzed error distributions per model. We found that proprietary LLMs primarily made overcaring errors, while open-source LLMs mostly made undercaring errors. Undercaring errors involve actively neglecting a patient in need, which is arguably more grave than committing an overcaring error, in which a patient receives too many resources. This suggests that proprietary models tend to make more aligned ethical choices, though at the expense of over-calibration. As Sun et al. [2024] note, while proprietary models may perform better, the increased transparency of open-source models offers an important trade-off to consider.\nIn our tests, neutral question formulations led to the best model performance. Most ethics prompts, which remind models of a specific moral context, had no effect or worsened performance. This suggests that emphasizing ethical implications can impair decision-making in emergency scenarios. While ethics prompts can be effective in some cases [Pan et al., 2023], focusing on actions and their consequences often reduces performance. Therefore, when using LLMs to assist with ethical decisions in the medical context, it may be best to use \"factual\" prompts to encourage rational decision-making.\nA limitation of TRIAGE is the lack of open-ended scenarios, which would enhance decision-making realism. However, since we observed significant differences between models and no ceiling effects, we believe TRIAGE still provides valuable insights into LLMs' ethical decision-making. While open-ended responses are harder to rate, we encourage future research to build on our method of using societal rules and frameworks for scenario and gold-label creation in open-ended benchmarks. Additionally, TRIAGE focuses solely on medical ethics; future work could expand to other domains, such as legal frameworks or moral development tests in children."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "Our work demonstrates that LLMs are capable of navigating complex ethical dilemmas in the medical domain. By incorporating real-world scenarios and requiring models to make explicit moral decisions, TRIAGE offers a more realistic to other ME benchmarks. Further, our approach does not rely on potentially unreliable human or AI annotations. Our findings suggest that while proprietary models generally perform better, particularly by avoiding undercaring errors, this comes with the risk of over-calibration. We further see that reminding models of an ethical context can worsen their decision making in emergency situations. Although TRIAGE is limited to the medical field and does not include open-ended scenarios, it provides valuable insights into the ethical decision making of LLMs."}, {"title": "A Impact statement", "content": "The goal of this work is to explore the potential of LLMs for supporting ethical decisions in the medical domain and to benchmark the ethical decision-making capabilities of current models. Potential risks of this work include the possibility of misuse in unregulated contexts, where ethical standards differ from those in the medical field, as well as concerns about over-reliance on Al systems, which may lead to diminished human involvement in critical decisions. Despite these limitations, we believe that our research is crucial for advancing the development of AI systems capable of making sound ethical decisions in high-stakes environments like healthcare. Further, our work provides insights that are essential for improving model reliability and safety. We hope our work can inform policy, regulation, and the future design of AI systems, to ensure AI systems are held to the highest ethical standards.\nFurthermore, our dataset includes some jailbreak examples which might be perceived as disturbing by some individuals.

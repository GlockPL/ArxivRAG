This serious infectious disease, characterized by skin lesions and potential complications, poses a pandemic threat in the post-COVID-19 era. Transmission occurs through direct contact, leading to diverse dermatological symptoms that demand early and accurate diagnosis. Conventional detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and manual examination, exhibit challenges of low sensitivity, high cost, and substantial workload. Therefore, deep learning offers an automated solution; however, the datasets include data scarcity, texture, contrast, inter-intra class variability, and similarities with other skin infectious diseases. In this regard, a novel hybrid approach is proposed that integrates the learning capacity of Residual Learning and Spatial Exploitation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a customized Swin Transformer (RS-FME-SwinT) to capture multi-scale global and local correlated features for MPox diagnosis. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT technique employs a transfer learning-based feature map enhancement (FME) technique, integrating the customized SwinT for global information capture, residual blocks for texture extraction, and spatial blocks for local contrast variations. Moreover, incorporating new inverse residual blocks within the proposed SwinT effectively captures local patterns and mitigates vanishing gradients. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT has strong learning potential of diverse features that systematically reduce intra-class MPox variation and enable precise discrimination from other skin diseases. Finally, the proposed RS-FME-SwinT is a holdout cross-validated on a diverse MPox dataset and achieved outperformance on state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT demonstrates commendable results of an accuracy of 97.80%, sensitivity of 96.82%, precision of 98.06%, and an F-score of 97.44% in MPox detection. The RS-FME-SwinT could be a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, enabling prompt and accurate MPox diagnosis and contributing significantly to mitigation efforts.\nKeywords: Deep Learning, Monkeypox, Diagnosis, CNN, ViT, Residual Learning, Spatial CNN.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The Zoonotic Orthopoxvirus, which causes an infectious disease called Monkeypox (MPox), belongs to the same poxviridae family as cowpox and smallpox and mainly infects monkeys and rodents, and can also spread from person to person [1], [2]. The first identification of the virus occurred in 1958, a pox-like disease affected a monkey in a Danish laboratory, and the first human infection was recorded in 1970 in the country that is known as Congo-Kinshasa, amidst initiatives to eliminate smallpox [3], [4]. The virus is mostly found in the central and western regions of Africa and can be transmitted through various ways, such as touching, biting, breathing, or contact with mucous membranes [5].\nEarly symptoms of MPox comprise fever, bodily ailments, and tiredness, followed by skin lesions that start as a red bump [6]. MPox is less contagious than COVID-19, but its cases have increased from 50 in 1990 to 5000 in 2020, with global outbreaks reported in 2022 [7], [8]. According to the CDC [9], 99,518 Mpox cases and 207 deaths were recorded in 2022-2023. From January 2024 to 10th September 2024, more than 24,000 confirmed or suspected MPox cases caused by MPox Virus clade I and clade II, resulting in over 600 deaths, have been reported across African Union Member States, with more than 5,000 of these cases confirmed, leading to heightened concern and fear on social media [10]\u2013[14]. The lack of expert doctors and testing kits makes it difficult to manage the disease, with the current diagnostic method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), being expensive and slow [15], [16], and no specific antiviral treatment for MPox [17]. Although there is no specific cure, the CDC has approved Brincidofovir and Tecovirimat, originally for smallpox, for MPox [18], [19]. Vaccination, FDA-approved but underused in the U.S., is practiced in other countries using smallpox vaccines against MPox [20]. Diagnosis involves manually observing skin lesions and confirming the virus through electron microscopy or PCR, commonly used in COVID-19 diagnosis [21]-[23].\nDeep Learning (DL), especially deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, demonstrates promise in the field of medical imaging, such as cancer, tumor, and COVID-19 detection [24]\u2013[26] [27]. Although various DL models exist for the detection of skin diseases, their application to MPox detection remains limited [28], [29]. Studies using DL for MPox classification face challenges including model interpretability, computational costs, and limited consideration of multiclass datasets [30]\u2013[32]. CNN facilitates the automatic"}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "MPox is a zoonotic viral disease affecting both animals and humans, closely related to the variola virus, which causes smallpox. First identified in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, MPox has since spread to multiple countries. The WHO classifies MPox as a moderate global health risk, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis for effective prevention and control. Diagnosis of MPox typically involves manual observation of skin lesions, followed by confirmation through electron microscopy or PCR, similar to methodologies used in COVID-19 diagnosis. DL has emerged as a powerful, automated tool in healthcare, showing significant potential for improving MPox diagnosis. In particular, CNNs and ViTs have proven effective in predicting MPox and other skin diseases, offering advanced capabilities in feature extraction and disease analysis.\nRecent studies have explored CNNs and ViTs for MPox diagnosis, utilizing diverse algorithms, datasets, and assessment metrics.

The transformer-based approach uses a hierarchical structure and divides the input images into non-overlapping patches for further processing. Consequently, the incorporation of shifted windows represents an advancement in ViT that addresses the non-overlapping local windows constraint of self-attention while maintaining connections across windows. The proposed SwinT model consists of three essential components: Patch and Positional Embedding, MHA to capture that captures global dependencies, and introduced a new IRB block. The IRB block in the customized SwinT integrates concepts from new convolutional skip connections for capturing local correlated features and reducing the chance of vanishing gradient. The SwinT embeds input images that excel in learning spatial correlations, employs self-attention, and IRB blocks to linearly project captured long-range dependencies and locally correlated features of complex lesion patterns, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 5."}, {"title": "Patch and Positional Embedding", "content": "The customized swinT adapts 2D images and segments into a series of flattened 2D patches, with each image patch representing a token.

Various ViT architectures adapt SA but lack global attention and dependencies. In this regard, MHA is employed that integrate dense global attention mechanisms and sparsity for global-level dependencies by stacking SA blocks and therefore, enhancing effectiveness. The MHA mechanism is the central part of the Transformer and fuses input tokens with weighted fusion. MHA handles self-attention constraints by calculating multiple similarity scores in distinct subspaces and reducing computational costs while increasing expressiveness and interpretability. Moreover, MHA resembles the subspace mechanism in convolution and enables the model to extract multi-subspace features effectively.\nThe transformer block comprises normalization, a residual connection, an MHA with key (K), query (Q), and value (V) computations, and an IRB with skip connections. The MHA process transforms the input vector into a query (Q), key (K), and (V) vectors, applying self-attention individually to each patch. The SoftMax activation is after the dot product of Q and K, producing an attention matrix. The resulting attention scores are multiplied by V, generating the self-attention result (SA (Q, K, V)), as depicted in Eq.

These blocks facilitate hierarchical feature extraction by employing multiple convolutional layers and capturing homogeneity. Each Spatial block employs a small 3x3 convolutional operation, followed by batch normalization, activation, and multiple layers for efficient local feature extraction (Eqs. 11-13) and in Figure 4. This strategic implementation enhances the network's capability to identify diverse features within skin images, thereby improving detection performance and accuracy. Each spatial block contains 3x3 convolutional layers with a padding of 1, followed by a 2x2 max-pooling layer with a stride of 2. These blocks handle spatial data across multiple layers, using 3x3 convolutional filters and both max and average pooling to improve the extraction of consistent features and the precise identification of local feature boundaries [51]. The convolutional kernels preserve spatial homogenous resolution while pooling layers capture high-intensity contrast information. Moreover, the pooling operation reduces spatial resolution at each block and increases robustness [52]. Five spatial blocks are stacked and employ repeated sequences of convolutional and pooling layers, forming a hierarchical feature extraction. This facilitates learning complex features at higher layers while preventing information loss at lower layers. Spatial blocks increase network depth for learning local homogeneous and correlated features, reduce parameters and computational complexity with small kernels, and enhance generalization through regularization."}, {"title": "Feature Map Enchancment Design", "content": "The proposed RS-FME-SwinT extracts diverse information from images, including global, texture, and local image representations by concatenating customized SwinT, residual, and spatial feature maps (Eq. 16) [24].

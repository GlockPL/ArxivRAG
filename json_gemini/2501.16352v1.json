Massive, complex,and multisource big data have brought new opportunitiesand challenges to artificial intelligence (AI) [171]. Com-pared with traditional single AI-based models, these bigdata have the following significant characteristics: 1) High-dimensional sparsity [10]: Big data usually contain a largenumber of feature dimensions, but each sample only involvesa small part of them, exhibiting high-dimensional sparsity.This poses a great challenge for modeling. 2) Heterogeneousmultisource [201]: Big data originate from various sensors,systems, and applications, presenting high heterogeneityand diversity. Effectively fusing these heterogeneous mul-tisource data is a key problem that needs to be addressed.3) Dynamic changes: Big data undergo continuous dynamicchanges over time, requiring the ability to adapt quicklyto environmental changes and achieve online learning andcontinuous optimization [203]. 4) Complex relationships[151]: Big data contain intricate and complex latent relation-ships that are difficult to fully and accurately capture with asingle model. Therefore, the traditional single AI model hasstruggled to cope with the massive and diversified big dataprocessing needs, making it urgent to explore new big dataprocessing paradigms to overcome these challenges.As a typical framework, the mixture of experts (MoE)[76, 85] has received considerable attention in recent years."}, {"title": "2. Mixture of Experts", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Basic Concepts and Development of MoE", "content": "Basic concepts. The mixture of experts (MoE) model[76, 85] is based on the ensemble learning method andother processing algorithms. MoE brings together multiplespecialized sub-models (i.e., \"expert networks\") to collab-oratively handle complex tasks. Unlike traditional neuralnetworks, the core idea of MoE is to divide the complexlearning problem into multiple relatively smaller and simpler sub-tasks, and distribute the data to the most suitable experts(or learners). Each expert provides predictions based on thedifferent characteristics of the input data in their respectiveareas of expertise. The Gating Network is responsible fordynamically selecting and integrating the outputs of theseexperts, ensuring that the system can make the optimaldecision in different situations and efficiently solve complextasks and challenges in big datasets. As shown in Figure 1,it presents an overview of the chronological development ofthe MoE models.Origin and development of MoE. In 1991, research ledby Jacobs first proposed the mixture of experts (MoE) model[76]. The early model design was relatively simple, generallyconsisting of a small number of experts, each focusing ona specific data subset. Representative models in this stageinclude Jacobs' basic gating network and the hierarchicalMOE (HME) [85]. These models achieved certain successin areas like speech recognition [47], demonstrating theeffectiveness of MoE in handling specific tasks. However,as the scale of datasets expanded, the limitations of theearly models gradually emerged, particularly in terms ofcomputational resource utilization and model scalability.Over 20 years later, with the improvement of computa-tional capability and the advancement of machine learning(ML) research [117], the MoE architecture has undergonecontinuous improvements. In 2017, Google proposed thesparse MoE model [145], which integrated MoE into longshort-term memory (LSTM) networks [54], creating a modelwith 137B parameters, using 10 times less computationthan the previous dense LSTM models, and significantlyimproving the model's performance. The development ofsparse gating mechanisms [141] has also made MoE mod-els more effective in selecting experts for complex tasks.However, although the MoE architecture has introduced newmechanisms and preliminarily demonstrated its potential forhandling big data, it still faces challenges in terms of trainingtime and computational resources in modern applications.Innovations in modern MoE architectures. With theadvent of the big data era, modern MoE architectures, es-pecially their applications in big data processing and deeplearning [95] models, have gained new vitality. The newMoE architectures not only increase the number of expertsbut also introduce more efficient training methods and morecomplex gating mechanisms. In June 2020, Google released\"GShard\" [99], which applied MoE to the Transformermodel, replacing the feed-forward network (FFN) layers inthe T5 (encoder-decoder) structure with MoE layers, andtrained a series of models ranging from 12.5B to 600Bparameters. Switch Transformers [45] further simplified therouting strategy based on T5, training the largest model withup to 1.6 trillion parameters, and pushing the parameter scaleof large language models (LLMs) [49, 196] from hundredsof billions to trillions. In 2022, the ST-MoE model [220] wasreleased, which conducted a deeper analysis of the structureand training strategies. In 2024, enterprises continuouslyreleased MoE-based LLMs, and the number of models withparameters exceeding 100 billion released from January to"}, {"title": "2.2. Basic Architecture and Mathematical Model", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.2.1. Architecture of MoE", "content": "The MoE architecture has two main types: competitiveMoE and cooperative MoE. In competitive MoE, data isforcibly partitioned into different discrete spaces, and eachexpert is responsible for handling a specific space. Thisarchitecture helps achieve specialization among models, butmay also lead to overly rigid data space partitioning, whichis not conducive to solving complex problems. In coopera-tive MoE, data partitioning is not strictly constrained, andthe experts can jointly process the input data, enabling amore flexible problem-solving approach. The MoE structureis mainly composed of three core components: the gatingmechanism, the expert network, and the output layer.

Key Technologies of MoE for Big Data", "content": "Based on the core ideas mentioned above, MoE hasdemonstrated powerful capabilities in addressing key techni-cal challenges in big data, effectively handling the diversityand complexity of data, and improving model performanceand generalization ability. We now systematically explorethese aspects in detail."}, {"title": "3.1. High-dimensional Sparse Data Modeling", "content": "High-dimensional sparse data [10] is a typical char-acteristic of big data, where the feature dimensionality isvery high in the dataset but the number of non-zero fea-tures in each sample is relatively small. This can lead tocomputational complexity, difficulties in handling sparsity,overfitting risks, and feature selection complexity, posing significant challenges for machine learning. MoE addressesthe challenges of high-dimensional sparse data by decom-posing it into multiple low-dimensional subspaces and hav-ing the expert networks learn them independently [114].This approach effectively reduces the computational com-plexity, enhances the model's generalization ability [71], andimproves the capture of local data structure through dynamicrouting [70].Subspace partitioning based on local structure. MoEfirst needs to perform effective subspace partitioning ofthe original high-dimensional data to capture the local datastructure. Cluster analysis is the currently popular method[10]. Cluster analysis is used to group the data points in thehigh-dimensional dataset into similar feature subsets or clus-ters, aggregating the data points with similar features intodifferent subspaces. MoE can divide the high-dimensionaldata space into subspaces with different centers, consideringthe intra-group correlations within the different subspacesto achieve dimension reduction. By partitioning the originalhigh-dimensional data into multiple relatively independentsubspaces based on the local structural characteristics of thedata, MoE can decouple the large-scale complex data intoseveral simple low-dimensional tasks, better capturing thelocal structural information of the data and laying a solidfoundation for subsequent modeling.Specialized modeling by expert networks. For eachsubspace, MoE will train a specialized expert network for"}, {"title": null, "content": "modeling. These expert networks can be various types ofmachine learning models, such as neural networks [119]and decision trees [136], and can choose the appropriatemodel structure based on the characteristics of the subspaceto achieve optimal local feature learning. This specializedmodeling approach not only better captures the local datastructure but also avoids overfitting by reducing the com-plexity of the model on the entire dataset, further enhancingthe robustness of the model on high-dimensional sparsedata. With the help of these techniques, the model canmore effectively learn useful features when processing high-dimensional sparse data while maintaining a relatively lowrisk of overfitting.Dynamic coordination by a gating network. In tra-ditional ML models, data processing usually relies on aglobal model, where all input samples use a single modelarchitecture to fit the entire dataset. This static modelingapproach has obvious limitations, especially in dealing withhigh-dimensional sparse data, as it cannot fully capture thecomplex heterogeneity and local features within the data,resulting in poor fitting of certain features and a lack of gen-eralization ability. However, this is the advantage of the MoEgating network. When new sample data are input, the gatingnetwork dynamically calculates the weights of the expertnetworks and routes the input to the most suitable expert forprediction [70]. The flexibility of this dynamic coordinationmechanism is significant in addressing high-dimensionalsparse data, allowing MoE to fully utilize the specialized advantages of different expert networks and improve the modeling accuracy of high-dimensional sparse data. Through the\"divide-and-conquer\" strategy mentioned above, MoE hasshown excellent performance in high-dimensional data mod-eling [19]. Compared to a single LLM, MoE better capturesthe local features of the data, thereby significantly improvingthe fitting capability for complex high-dimensional data. Forexample, in spectral data calibration, previous studies used asparse Bayesian MoE model to select the sparse features ofthe multivariate calibration model, effectively handling thehigh-dimensional sparse data and improving the accuracyand efficiency of spectral data calibration."}, {"title": "3.2. Heterogeneous Multisource Data Fusion", "content": "Heterogeneous data typically originates from varioussensors, systems, and applications, exhibiting a high degreeof heterogeneity and diversity. The differences in data formatand structure increase the difficulty of model fusion andintegration. How to effectively fuse these heterogeneousmultisource data is another key technical challenge facingMoE in big data applications [201].Heterogeneous data preprocessing and encoding.MoE first needs to perform unified preprocessing and encod-ing of heterogeneous data from different channels, unifyingdata from different sources and types to the same standard[202]. This includes: 1) Missing value processing: Big datamay have missing values due to equipment failures, networkinterruptions, and other reasons during the data collectionprocess. Using methods such as interpolation and deletion"}, {"title": null, "content": "to handle missing values, ensuring data integrity, reducingprediction errors caused by missing values, and ensuringthe temporal continuity and robustness of the data. 2) Featurenormalization: The range of different feature values in bigdata can vary greatly, which may cause some features todominate the model training, affecting the fairness and ac-curacy of the model. Therefore, it is necessary to normal-ize the data with different feature value ranges, eliminatethe influence of feature value ranges, reduce the mutualinfluence between features, and make them comparable. 3)Categorical variable encoding: If no encoding is performed,the model will find it difficult to handle non-numerical data.Textual, categorical, and other data types in big data needto be converted to numerical data to facilitate ML mod-els, improve the model's interpretability and generalizationability, reduce dimensionality, and enhance computationalefficiency.Heterogeneous modeling of expert networks. For dif-ferent types of data sources, MoE will train dedicated expertnetworks for modeling [214, 217]. These experts can usedifferent model structures to adapt to their data characteris-tics. For example, for image data, using convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) [102] can effectively extract spatial fea-tures and reduce the impact of mutual interference betweentasks on network performance. For text data, Transformer-based models (such as BERT) [39] can capture long-rangedependencies and better understand complex text content[59]. Furthermore, for time series data such as medical logsor stock prices, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [104] orlong short-term memory (LSTMs) can better handle timede-pendence and have become popular and widely used modelsfor predicting future events or results [97]. In this way, eachexpert network can delve into and understand the inherentcharacteristics of its data type.Adaptive fusion of gating networks. When inputtingnew sample data, the gating network will adaptively ad-just the weights of each expert network according to thecharacteristics of the data, realizing the dynamic fusion ofheterogeneous multisource data [178]. This adaptive fusionmechanism allows MoE to fully utilize the strengths ofeach expert, improving the modeling effect on complexdata. The innovative gating function effectively fuses data ofmultiple modalities, solving the problem of large differencesin format and content, and retaining as many features ofthe multisource data as possible, improving the convergencespeed of the fusion [60]."}, {"title": "3.3.

MoEcan dynamically add, remove [70], or fine-tune [24, 110,140, 146] expert networks in response to the immediatecharacteristics of the data, to adapt to changes in data dis-tribution. When a new data subspace is detected, MoE canimmediately train a corresponding new expert network toadapt to the new data subspace [98, 101]. For example, inthe training of LLMs, MoE can effectively expand the modelcapacity while minimizing computational cost through asparse gating mechanism [125, 137], avoiding catastrophicforgetting, and smoothly adapting to changes in data distri-bution while maintaining previous knowledge [25]. Further-more, when certain data types or patterns no longer appearfrequently or the structure changes slightly, MoE can removeor fine-tune outdated expert networks to address the issuesof high memory consumption and expert redundancy [194],ensuring the model maintains high efficiency, accuracy, andcomputational resource savings.Online optimization of gating networks. Continuousoptimization of the gating network is another key aspect ofonline learning. The online learning mechanism of the gat-ing network allows the model to constantly self-adjust basedon continuously updated data, ensuring optimal performanceat different periods. MoE typically uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [85] or gradient descent [3,7] to perform real-time adjustments of the gating networkparameters and optimize the weight allocation of each ex-pert network. It can also track changes in data distributionin real-time, efficiently capturing local data characteristics,and flexibly allocating computational resources for differentsubspaces to improve robustness. This dynamic coordinationmechanism enables MoE to track changes in data distribu-tion, quickly adjust the activation state of expert networks,and maintain prediction accuracy.Incremental learning algorithms. MoE can also adoptincremental/continual learning algorithms [51] to furtherimprove online learning efficiency [17, 191]. Compared totraditional batch learning, incremental learning has a clearefficiency advantage. In the case of huge data volumes,retraining the entire model not only takes time and effort butalso consumes a large amount of computational resources.Incremental learning algorithms allow the model to updateonly the relevant parameters when new data arrives, withoutretraining the entire network. This approach significantlyreduces computational costs and is suitable for handling thecontinuous flow of big data. Incremental learning algorithmsachieve model updates through the gradual learning of newdata. They have the advantages of high efficiency, real-time, and strong adaptability compared to batch learningalgorithms. Additionally, incremental learning avoids theforgetting effect when dealing with data changes, ensuringthat the model does not lose important historical informationdue to new data [191]."}, {"title": null, "content": "By leveraging strategies such as flexible expert networkstructure adjustment, online gating optimization, and incremental learning, the MoE model demonstrates significantadvantages and the ability to adapt quickly to environmentalchanges in big data fusion applications.

Enhancing Model Interpretability", "content": "Model interpretability determines the user's trust in itsdecisions and has a profound impact on the model's practi-cal application in various domains. As a typical black-boxmodel [16], a single ML model often struggles to explainits internal decision-making process, which can affect theuser's trust in the model's output. In the era of big data,the volume and complexity of data have greatly increasedthe demand for model interpretability, and the hierarchicalstructure of MoE has shown unique advantages in enhancingmodel interpretability. Through its gating network and mul-tiple expert networks, MoE provides a highly interpretablestructure that can further enhance user trust and promote itswidespread deployment in big data applications [52].(1) Hierarchical structure provides interpretability.The hierarchical structure of MoE, including the gatingnetwork and multiple expert networks, makes the entiremodel decision-making process more transparent. Users canunderstand how the input data is first routed to the appropri-ate expert networks, and how each expert network processesspecific data subspaces to make key decisions that influencethe final output [4]. Compared to traditional models, thehierarchical decision-making process of MoE appears moretransparent, as traditional deep learning models often cannotprovide sufficient explanations to cope with these diversedata [120]. The high-dimensional features and diverse datatypes in big data precisely require such a highly transparentmodel structure. This clear explanation path can trace theentire process of the model extracting features from data,allocating weights to expert networks to process data sub-spaces, and integrating the output, thereby enhancing userunderstanding and trust in the model.(2) Expert network-specific explanations. Since eachexpert network is focused on processing a specific datasubspace, its internal decision logic is often simpler andeasier to explain. The complexity of big data often involvesdata features from different domains, such as medical imag-ing data and genetic sequence data, which have drasticallydifferent data characteristics. MoE's expert networks cancultivate the specialized capabilities of different experts,using more targeted and refined experts to handle thesedifferent complex datasets [75, 163]. Users can have higherconfidence in the expert networks corresponding to specificdomains. They can also optimize and debug the modelsbased on the specific data characteristics. In comparison,traditional single models may not be able to handle suchcomplex data distributions and features effectively, and the"}, {"title": null, "content": "expert networks of the MoE model simplify the decision-making path, enhancing the overall model interpretability.(3) Gating network decision explanations. As the coredecision-making component of MoE, the gating networkis responsible for routing input data to the various expertnetworks. By analyzing the internal parameters of the gatingnetwork, users can understand which features play a key rolein the final decision [82]. This clear feature weight analysisnot only helps users understand the output contribution ofeach part of the model but also enables them to identifythe most influential key factors in the data, thereby enhanc-ing the model's transparency and trustworthiness. Anothermajor advantage of the gating network is that its dynamicgating adjustments can also be understood in real-time byusers. This dynamic selection mechanism not only endows the model with flexibility but also allows users to analyzethe changing trend of weight at each time point, enablingusers to understand the dynamic shifts in the importance ofdifferent data features and predict the model's behavior [82].(4) Human-computer interaction explanation mecha-nism. To further enhance interpretability, MoE can alsoutilize a human-computer interaction (HCI) mechanism [103].In big data applications, user requirements and data char-acteristics are often dynamic and complex. Users can usea visualization and interactive interface to intuitively under-stand the internal logic of the model, and provide feedback topromote the continuous optimization and transparency of themodel behavior [116, 164]. The human-computer interactionmechanism can help users better understand the model andpropose modification suggestions during the model trainingand optimization process. Users can adjust the weights ofspecific features or introduce new expert networks to handleparticular data subsets based on the model's interpretabil-ity results. Through this feedback loop mechanism, theMoE model can achieve self-improvement and graduallyevolve towards a more transparent, interpretable, and user-expectation-compliant direction.The hierarchical structure of MoE, the specializeddecision-making paths of the expert networks, the featureweight explanation mechanism of the gating network, andthe HCI system collectively construct a transparent andhighly interpretable framework. The interpretability of theMoE model not only helps establish user trust, but alsoallows the model's decision-making process to be continu-ously optimized through user feedback, providing importantsupport for the iterative upgrade of the model, and enhancinguser trust in the model through the feedback loop.

However, the widespread integration of AI into critical domains and everyday life brings forth substantial risks, including privacy and copyright issues, potential biases, and security concerns [1]. These challenges underscore the urgent need for robust governance frameworks to ensure that AI technologies are developed, deployed, and managed in a manner that is safe, transparent, and accountable. Consequently, Responsible AI (RAI) [2] has emerged as a crucial foundation for safeguarding the ethical integrity and societal impact of AI.\nIn parallel, the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework has gained prominence as a tool for especially investors to evaluate non-financial risks and opportunities within companies. As AI becomes a central component of business operations and strategies, it is increasingly critical to assess its impact through the ESG lens. There is a growing consensus that AI's ethical and societal implications cannot be effectively managed in isolation but must be integrated into broader corporate governance practices [3]. However, despite the alignment in goals, there remains a significant gap in how RAI principles are operationalized within existing ESG frameworks, leading to inconsistencies in governance and a potential lack of accountability.\nThis paper bridges this gap by advocating for the integration of RAI practices within the ESG framework, arguing that this synergy is essential for holistic and responsible AI governance. By embedding RAI within ESG, companies can ensure that their AI strategies not only comply with RAI standards but also contribute to sustainable and socially responsible business practices. To support this argument, we draw on insights from a collaborative research project between a leading research institute and an asset management firm in Australia [4]. This collaboration involved in-depth interviews with 28 publicly listed companies, focusing on the practical challenges and opportunities in aligning RAI with ESG principles."}, {"title": "Integrating RAI and ESG", "content": "ESG frameworks are essential tools for managing non-financial risks such as environmental impact, social responsibility, and corporate governance. However, they often overlook the unique ethical and governance challenges posed by AI. Integrating RAI into ESG strategies is crucial, as it not only mitigates AI-related risks but also enhances sustainable and ethical governance, thereby aligning AI initiatives with broader corporate objectives.\nThe integration of RAI into ESG frameworks can be understood through three key dimensions:\n1. AI as a Mitigator of ESG Risks: AI technologies can play a significant role in reducing ESG-related risks. For example, AI can optimize resource use, improve energy efficiency, and strengthen governance practices to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. AI-driven analytics, for instance, can reduce environmental footprints by enabling more efficient operations.\n2. AI as a Driver of Positive ESG Outcomes: Beyond risk mitigation, AI has the potential to enhance ESG outcomes by driving operational efficiencies, improving customer experiences, and advancing sustainability initiatives. For example, AI-powered solutions in healthcare can increase accessibility to services while minimizing waste, thus contributing to both social and environmental goals.\n3. RAI as an Integral ESG Concern: The ethical challenges associated with AI-such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and cybersecurity\u2014are closely aligned with ESG principles. Addressing these challenges through RAI practices is essential for ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability, which are fundamental to both governance and social responsibility.\nDespite the clear synergies between RAI and ESG, our research identifies a significant gap in how organizations integrate RAI into their ESG frameworks. This gap often manifests as a disconnect between internal RAI policies and external disclosures, highlighting the need for improved transparency and accountability. Furthermore, existing ESG reporting standards, such as those from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), currently lack specific guidance on addressing AI-related risks, complicating efforts to align RAI with ESG strategies.\nAlthough governments and industry bodies, including the EU AI Act [5] and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework [6], have begun to acknowledge the importance of integrating AI considerations within ESG frameworks, these initiatives are still in their early stages and do not yet provide comprehensive coverage. Therefore, it is imperative for companies to proactively embed RAI within their ESG frameworks to ensure that AI practices contribute positively to their overall ESG objectives, ultimately fostering sustainable and responsible business operations."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This study is primarily based on qualitative data gathered through interviews with representatives from 28 companies spanning eight industry sectors, supplemented by desktop research on these companies. The interviews and research were focused on understanding AI policies, implementation strategies, governance, and stakeholder engagement, with a particular emphasis on RAI and ESG considerations.\nProject Participants: The project team consisted of members with diverse backgrounds and expertise, including RAI researchers, ESG experts/investors, an industrial AI expert, a project manager, and a design thinking practitioner. The project began with a hybrid workshop to establish clear research objectives. During this workshop, concurrent discussions led to the finalization of several strategic goals for the subsequent engagement phases, including the selection of sectors and companies to investigate."}, {"title": "Company Insights", "content": "This section presents a summary of 10 key insights (IN1 - IN10) derived from an analysis of RAI practices, with a focus on identifying gaps in public disclosures, assessing AI implementation maturity, understanding employee engagement levels, and evaluating board capabilities. These insights are organized systematically to align with the board-level oversight, RAI commitment, implementation, and metrics dimensions outlined in a recent ESG-AI framework [7], which provides a structured approach to integrating RAI within corporate governance.\n\u2022 Board oversight\nIN1. Strengthening Board and leadership capability in AI, technology and ethics\n\u2022 RAI commitment\nIN2. Only a small percentage of companies publicly disclose their RAI policies\nIN3. Most companies are investing in AI, but RAI policies and reporting are still being developed\nIN4. Data privacy is a key ESG issue, but other topics are still important and may be overlooked\nIN5. Companies are using different strategies for navigating and managing RAI risk, but supply chain manage- ment can be overlooked\n\u2022 RAI implementation\nIN6. Global equities are at the forefront of AI implementation"}, {"title": "Board Oversight", "content": "Board oversight is primarily associated with board accountability and capability. This dimension ensures that AI gover- nance is integrated into corporate structures, with accountability and competence required for effective management and oversight of RAI practices.\nMore specifically, navigating the complexities of AI deployment requires tech-savvy board members [IN1]. Companies must invest in training programs to raise AI awareness among their leadership. Proactive approaches, such as those adopted by MercadoLibre and ANZ, enhance board capabilities and ensure informed decision-making. Increasing AI expertise at the board level is vital for effective governance and strategic oversight of AI initiatives."}, {"title": "RAI Commitment", "content": "This dimension is particularly related to company's transparency and responsible disclosure, addressing concerns about public RAI policy and sensitive AI use cases. While public RAI policy promotes user awareness of impactful AI interactions [8], sensitive use cases are regarded as high-risk AI which can cause significant issues to health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons.\nCurrent trends indicate that only 10% of interviewed companies publicly disclose their RAI policies, despite 40% having internal policies [IN2]. This disparity highlights a need for increased transparency and accountability within the corporate sector. Greater public disclosure of RAI policies can enhance stakeholder trust and demonstrate a company's commitment to RAI practices. A notable example of transparency is Commonwealth Bank, which has published its inaugural AI policy, setting a benchmark for others to follow.\nHowever, there is a noticeable gap between RAI activities and their reflection in public reports [IN3]. Comprehensive reporting, including AI in risk statements and annual reports, is essential for transparency and stakeholder trust. Companies must bridge this gap by integrating AI-related disclosures into their broader ESG reporting frameworks to provide a clear and accurate representation of their RAI efforts.\nThere is a common consensus among the engaged companies that data privacy and cybersecurity are primary ESG concerns related to AI [IN4]. However, other critical issues like human rights and modern slavery receive limited attention in AI discussions. Companies like Transurban prioritize data privacy and governance, setting an example for addressing these concerns. Broadening the focus to include these under explored topics ensures a comprehensive approach to ESG in AI implementations.\nTo ensure transparency and privacy, managing AI risks should extend to supply chains and strategic partnerships [IN5]. Companies must ensure their procurement processes incorporate RAI considerations. Strategic partnerships (e.g., the Commonwealth Bank's collaboration with H2O.ai) highlight the importance of addressing AI risks throughout the supply chain. This approach ensures that ethical standards and operational integrity are maintained across all business operations."}, {"title": "RAI Implementation", "content": "RAI implementation should ensure the responsible use of AI in daily operations. This includes key considerations and practices such as dedicated RAI responsibility, employee awareness, system integration, and AI incident management and reporting.\nThrough company engagement, we have identified that global leaders in AI implementation showcase extensive use cases and strategic integration, demonstrating how AI can be harnessed for competitive advantage and operational efficiency [IN6]. Companies such as Shell and MercadoLibre exemplify this trend with their robust AI strategies. In contrast, some regional companies (e.g., Australian companies, particularly in the banking sector) are beginning to"}, {"title": "RAI Metrics", "content": "It is crucial for companies to identify RAI metrics, measure and manage RAI performance, and share these with stakeholders [9]. Disclosing these metrics and their performance increases transparency, enhances stakeholder awareness of RAI practices, and ultimately empowers investors to make more informed decisions.\nMoreover, strong ESG performance correlates with increased confidence in managing AI, indicating that companies excelling in ESG are better positioned to handle AI-related challenges [IN10]. Examples like Keysight and Mirvac illus- trate how robust ESG frameworks can inform RAI practices. This correlation underscores the importance of integrating ESG principles and key metrics into AI strategies to enhance overall corporate responsibility and sustainability."}, {"title": "Recommendations", "content": "This section provides five key recommendations for enhancing RAI practices. While not exhaustive, these suggestions offer a solid starting point for developing more robust frameworks. These recommendations are grounded in real-world insights from leading companies, reflecting their best practices and challenges. Moreover, RAI practices can be supported by the right tools and techniques (e.g., RAI patterns) at various levels such as the industry level, organization level and team level. We identified applicable patterns from the Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue proposed in [10] that companies can implement alongside each recommendation."}, {"title": "Enhance Board and Leadership AI Capabilities", "content": "This recommendation supports Board oversight, addressing the first insight [IN1] in the previous section.\nCompanies with knowledgeable top management are better equipped to make informed decisions about AI strategies, balancing risks and opportunities effectively [11]. This demonstrates a proactive approach to responsible AI, which can boost investor confidence by showcasing a commitment to ethical leadership and innovation.\nTo achieve this, companies should i) identify gaps in AI and technology knowledge among current top management, ii) recruit new executives with strong AI and technology backgrounds, iii) implement ongoing training programs for existing top management to stay updated on AI developments and ethical considerations, and iv) establish an RAI advisory group within the executive team to focus specifically on AI and related technologies.\nAs in RAI patterns, Board capability can be enhanced by organization-level RAI patterns such as Leadership Commit- ment for RAI\u00b9 and RAI Training\u00b2. These patterns can be used to secure a more robust and expedited implementation of leadership in RAI within the organization."}, {"title": "Increase Transparency in RAI Policies", "content": "A company's RAI commitment can be strengthened through enhanced transparency and the adoption of comprehensive RAI policies and practices. This can be achieved by primarily developing and disclosing RAI policies [IN2], incor- porating holistic RAI principles and practices within these policies, and considering the entire supply chain [IN4 and IN5].\nMore importantly, companies should publicly disclose their RAI policies to build stakeholder trust and demonstrate a commitment to responsible AI practices [12, 8]. Transparency in AI governance can enhance a company's reputation, align with growing demands for corporate accountability, and encourage investor confidence through clear, responsible practices.\nAccordingly, companies should i) develop clear and comprehensive RAI policies if they are not already in place, ii) publish these policies on the company's website and include them in annual reports and ESG disclosures, iii) highlight key principles and guidelines that govern the ethical use of AI within your organization, iv) provide case studies or examples of how these policies are implemented in practice.\nRAI Law and Regulation\u00b3 and RAI Standards\u2074 patterns at the industry level should be considered to develop RAI policies aligned with relevant regulations and standards. Additionally, organization-level patterns such as Code for RAI\u2074 provide overarching guidelines for establishing a robust RAI framework and policies."}, {"title": "Promote Employees' AI Literacy", "content": "To advance in the market, a company needs to improve its maturity level in RAI implementation [IN6]. This can begin with ensuring that all stakeholders (e.g., employees) have a solid understanding of AI, the opportunities and risks associated with its use, and strong competency [IN7].\nEngaged and informed employees can identify AI opportunities and manage risks effectively [13]. This approach supports a strong risk management culture and drives innovation, showing the company values RAI development and is committed to fostering an environment of continuous learning and ethical improvement. To achieve this, we recommend fostering a culture of curiosity and engagement around AI through training and awareness programs for all employees, including non-technical staff.\nSpecifically, companies should i) develop AI literacy programs that explain the basics of AI, its applications, and ethical considerations, ii) encourage collaboration between technical and non-technical staff to generate AI-related ideas and solutions, iii) create an internal AI community or forum where employees can share knowledge, discuss AI developments, and collaborate on projects, and iv) provide opportunities for hands-on learning and experimentation with AI tools and technologies.\nRAI Risk Committee pattern can help to monitor, provide feedback and support organizational culture and RAI training. RAI Training pattern can be a useful tool to plan and implement of RAI training for the employees, and ultimately contribute to sharpen the employees' skills in developing or using AI systems responsibly."}, {"title": "Foster Cross-functional Employee Engagement", "content": "As most companies are well aware of the importance of employee engagement, RAI implementation can be accelerated by transparent communications, knowledge-sharing, and cultural innovation [IN8]. At the same time, it is crucial that RAI implementation, including AI governance and management practices, avoids becoming siloed [IN9].\nAccordingly, companies should embed AI governance within existing systems and processes, involving representatives from various disciplines to oversee AI strategy and ensure its alignment with corporate values, including ESG principles. More importantly, cross-disciplinary governance ensures that AI decisions are ethically sound and align with the company's broader business objectives, protecting social license, customer trust, and data privacy [14].\nInterviews with companies reveal that those with robust ESG governance are better equipped to adapt to RAI challenges and integration compared to those lacking in this area. This approach reassures investors that the company is taking a holistic and responsible approach to AI, leveraging ESG and design capabilities to foster trust and ensure sustainable"}, {"title": "Implement Robust RAI Reporting and Target Setting", "content": "Our insights reveal that while companies have dedicated commitment to RAI initiatives, they lack considerations for RAI reporting [IN3]. There is a significant gap between RAI activities and their reflection in public reports. Moreover, there is a need for RAI targets and metrics, in alignment with ESG topics and performance, to be identified, managed, and disclosed to external stakeholders [IN10].\nWe recommend developing comprehensive RAI reporting mechanisms and setting clear AI targets. Publicly reporting on AI initiatives and their alignment with ESG goals is essential. This may include establishing clear AI guardrails to mitigate risks while fostering innovation, ensuring a balanced and forward-thinking AI strategy.\nConsistent and transparent reporting on RAI activities enables investors and stakeholders to assess the company's commitment to responsible AI use. In particular, rigorous monitoring and transparent reporting of serious incidents involving high-risk AI are essential. This approach serves as a vital mechanism to capture real-world failures, prevent their recurrence, and generate valuable insights that benefit all stakeholders [15]. Furthermore, setting and publicly sharing targets drives progress and accountability, showcasing leadership in AI governance. This can enhance investor confidence by demonstrating a clear, responsible strategy for AI development and implementation.\nTo achieve these goals, a set of RAI practices should be implemented. Specifically, i) establish clear, measurable targets for AI initiatives that align with the company's ESG goals, ii) develop a framework for tracking and reporting progress toward these targets, iii) include RAI reporting in annual reports, ESG disclosures, and other public communications, and iv) regularly review and update targets and reporting frameworks to reflect advancements in AI and evolving ethical standards."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "The integration of RAI into existing ESG frameworks is crucial for aligning ethical AI practices with broader sustain- ability goals. This study emphasizes a strong connection between RAI and ESG, while also identifying significant gaps in public disclosures and internal governance. To address these challenges, we recommend that companies enhance board-level expertise in RAI, increase transparency in RAI policies, improve employee awareness and engagement in RAI, and set clear AI targets. These recommendations align with key ESG topics such as board and management oversight, policy development, disclosure and reporting, diversity, equity, inclusion, human rights, and labor manage- ment [7], thereby securing better ESG performance. Implementing these recommendations allows companies to more effectively integrate RAI strategies that support both ethical AI development and long-term ESG objectives, ultimately leading to more responsible and transparent AI practices.\nThis study has some limitations that provide opportunities for future improvement. Although we included global companies in the interviews, 60% of the engaged companies are based in Australia. This concentration may pose a challenge in generalizing the insights across different regions. In the next steps, we plan to include a more diverse set of companies from various geographical locations to enhance the representativeness of our findings. Additionally, we relied solely on the interview responses without corroborating them with real-world practices, which means the study lacks direct evidence. To improve the validity of our conclusions, we intend to gather real-world data by conducting in-depth analyses of the companies' RAI practices in future research."}]}

Building on the limitations identified in the SimpleBench benchmark, a dataset designed to evaluate logical coherence and real-world reasoning, we propose a multi-step prompting strategy coupled with global consistency checks to improve model accuracy and robustness. Through comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, including Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5, GPT-40, and o1-preview, we demonstrate that iterative reasoning significantly enhances model performance, with improvements observed in both standard accuracy metrics (AVG@5) and a newly introduced metric, Extreme Averaging (EAG@5). Our results reveal model-specific strengths: Claude excels in maintaining logical consistency, while GPT-40 exhibits exploratory creativity but struggles with ambiguous prompts. By analyzing case studies and identifying gaps in spatial and temporal reasoning, we highlight areas for further refinement. The findings underscore the potential of structured reasoning frameworks to address inherent model limitations, irrespective of pretraining methodologies.

Despite their impressive performance, these models often face limitations in maintaining logical coherence and navigating multi-step problem-solving scenarios. Traditional approaches to reasoning in LLMs, such as direct inference or chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, have provided partial solutions. However, these methods frequently struggle with ensuring global consistency and adapting to ambiguous or novel problems.\n\nThe emergence of evaluation benchmarks such as SimpleBench (Phillip & Hemang 2024) has further illuminated these shortcomings. SimpleBench is designed to assess LLMs on their ability to reason through logical tasks, combining real-world contexts with abstract problem-solving. It combines diverse question formats, ranging from spatial reasoning to ethical decision-making, to test a model's ability to navigate nuanced problem spaces. Unlike benchmarks focused solely on accuracy, SimpleBench emphasizes the importance of logical coherence and contextual understanding. While current frontier models have shown promise, their reasoning often falters in edge cases where nuanced understanding and iterative refinement are crucial. These observations underscore the need for enhanced frameworks capable of overcoming these barriers."}, {"title": "Problem Statement", "content": "Existing methods for reasoning in LLMs rely heavily on static or minimally iterative frameworks, which lack the flexibility to refine solutions dynamically.

However, CoT relies on static reasoning chains that cannot adapt dynamically during inference, leading to challenges in handling ambiguous or complex inputs.\n\nA 2024 study also attempted iterative CoT prompting with integrated feedback loops to refine reasoning during inference (Sun et al. 2024). While this approach introduced dynamic correction capabilities, it was limited in scalability and often suffered from inconsistencies in complex multi-step tasks. Our framework diverges by introducing a dedicated external module for iterative refinement, enabling more robust and globally consistent reasoning outcomes.\n\nOur methodology leverages multi-step prompting, feedback mechanisms, and global consistency checks to iteratively enhance reasoning quality.

The baseline models were chosen as they were the last iteration of models by OpenAI & Anthropic that were not trained on a system of reasoning steps. Unlike conventional one-shot inference methods, where the model directly predicts an answer, this approach prompts the model to generate reasoning steps iteratively. Each reasoning step builds upon the previous steps, ensuring a gradual and logically consistent derivation of the solution. This approach leverages the strengths of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling the model to break down complex problems into manageable components.\n\nThe architecture consists of several interconnected modules: the step generation module, the feedback gate, the global consistency check mechanism, and the final solution derivation component. A restart counter and step limiter enforce control over computational resources and iterative depth. These modules collectively facilitate a structured, iterative problem-solving framework. The activity diagram, found in section 7.1, can be viewed in the appendix of this paper."}, {"title": "Step Generation", "content": "Step generation is the foundational component of the model infrastructure.

The step generation module also incorporates mechanisms to detect when no further steps are required, using an early termination signal, NO_MORE_STEPS, to avoid unnecessary computations."}, {"title": "Feedback Gate", "content": "The feedback gate serves as a validation mechanism for the reasoning steps. Each reasoning step is evaluated against the problem context and previous steps to ensure logical consistency and adherence to natural laws.

Logical consistency with prior steps.\n2.  Alignment with the problem's constraints and context.\n3.

This observation raises an important question: could scaling baseline models like GPT-40 result in comparable enhancements to reasoning capabilities?\n\nAnother intriguing aspect is whether ol's reasoning relies on an iterative process that utilizes intermediate outputs to inform subsequent steps or if it primarily employs a one-shot approach. Insights from OpenAI's playground, which tracks unique reasoning tokens for outputs but not inputs, suggest a predominance of one-shot reasoning (Brown et al., 2020). In contrast, the iterative framework examined in this study offers a compelling alternative. Although computationally more demanding, such a framework could achieve superior accuracy with adequate training resources. Moreover, iterative feedback loops might address the creativity limitations identified in recent comparisons between o1 and GPT-40, further enhancing ol's capacity for diverse reasoning tasks ((Li et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "Behavioral Divergences Between GPT-40 and Claude", "content": "The user-observed analysis of GPT-40 and Claude models, when enhanced, also revealed a striking divergence in their reasoning approaches:\n\n\u2022\n\nExploratory Reasoning in GPT-40:\nGPT-40 exhibited a more creative and exploratory reasoning style, often attempting to contextualize the problem with broader assumptions. This approach reflects its design, which prioritizes flexibility and a wide-ranging understanding of prompts. While this creativity proved advantageous in ambiguous scenarios, it occasionally led to overcomplications in structured benchmarks, where focused reasoning was required.\n\n\u2022\n\nObjective and Consistent Claude:\nIn contrast, Claude models demonstrated a more objective and structured reasoning approach. Their outputs were marked by consistent logical alignment, with minimal deviations or restarts. This reliability reflects their optimization for precision and stability, likely a result of their training framework emphasizing adherence to defined reasoning paths. However, this confidence sometimes limited their ability to explore alternative solutions, which could be a disadvantage in more open-ended or creative tasks."}, {"title": "Potential Impacts of Restarts and Exploratory Reasoning", "content": "The differences in reasoning styles underscore a potential opportunity for complementary use. For instance, GPT-40's exploratory behavior might compensate for Claude's tendency toward rigidity, while Claude's consistency could ground GPT-40's more expansive reasoning. Their use in tandem could offer an even more lucrative score on SimpleBench.\n\nThe findings also highlight a potential utility of strategic restarts during reasoning. In certain test cases, models like GPT-40 and Claude reached a near-perfect score (4/5) but failed to achieve full marks due to a unique but inaccurate initial step generation caused by the high temperature setting. However, forcing restarts during early reasoning stages, particularly with higher temperature values, may foster the exploration of alternative solutions, increasing the likelihood of identifying optimal reasoning chains."}, {"title": "Specific Question Analysis", "content": "To better understand how different models perform on complex reasoning tasks, we selected two prompts from our dataset as representative examples.

For instance, in cases where contextual clarity is lacking, a model could suggest multiple potential solutions or pose clarifying questions to refine its understanding of the problem as a form of active RLHF.\n\nSuch an approach not only enhances the model's reasoning capacity but also engages the user as an active participant in the problem-solving process.

These models can be trained not only to generate intermediate reasoning steps but also to derive feedback and comprehend the assumptions underlying their outputs. In simpler terms, having a contextually aware and specifically trained model on how to generate reasoning steps that mimic Chain-of-Thoughts may provide more accurate solutions and pathways. This strategy combined with the recent studies in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting may show that such step-by-step generation could significantly improve task performance in language models from an end-to-end user perspective (Wei et al., 2022).\n\nAnother novel concept involves the use of a dedicated end-gate model that synthesizes the outputs of multiple CoT's to produce a coherent and validated final solution. Similar to the global consistency check that is used in our solution, we can provide this end-gate model with a diverse set of reasoning paths to ensure consistency, robustness, and an improved capacity for error detection. This end gate model falls in the same family as the specifically trained models that are small at scale yet domain rich in their specific role."}, {"title": null, "content": "This inherently brings forward the question of the Chain-of-Thought process itself. Why is it that we are judging the performance of this model based on the final solution that the CoT produced? A question that arises in our discussions is what if we rather trained our specific models to synthesize multiple CoT's that reach the same yet correct final solution? Instead of treating loss as the distance from the final solution, we should rather train the loss on the quality of the CoT's it produces to reach that final solution. This loss term however is just a fractional representation of all the specific models involved in producing the final result. The division of this loss term would need to be understood as a combined value between the accuracy of the step generated, the logical flow of all steps, and the effectiveness of the global consistency check. This self-learning paradigm could bridge the gap between pre-defined human heuristics and emergent model-driven logic."}, {"title": "Incorporating Assumptions, Consistency, and Diversions into Feedback Loops", "content": "Efficiently handling assumptions, inconsistencies, and diversions within the reasoning process is critical for optimizing the CoT system (Zhang et al., 2023). Our current method involves restarting the CoT generation process whenever a logical inconsistency or error is identified. However, this approach is computationally expensive and may lead to redundant evaluations.\n\nWe propose a more efficient strategy where the feedback mechanism has the authority to generate alternative CoTs at the specific point of divergence, rather than restarting the entire process. By delegating the authority to address diversions to the feedback gate, the model can target critical junctures without reprocessing the entire reasoning chain. This method reduces computational overhead while maintaining high solution fidelity as CoT's are generated recursively as they are identified.\n\nFurthermore, by restricting global evaluations to the end-gates of CoTs (start node \u2013 end node path), the system can streamline its validation process, focusing only on how the synthesized outputs differ from where they diverged in their reasoning steps. A strong representation of this can be seen in figure 3, where a heat map represents the abstract solution space in which solutions might exists.

For instance, tasks that exhibit temporal or logical independence can be grouped and executed simultaneously, streamlining multi-step problem-solving. By leveraging parallel execution, the system can process multiple reasoning paths concurrently and reconcile their outputs in subsequent stages.\n\nAdditionally, we propose a novel method inspired by hierarchical abstraction: identifying \"chunks\" of a reasoning branch that can be preprocessed at higher levels of granularity before delving into finer details. This technique mirrors the process of outlining an idea before filling in intricate details\u2014it allows the model to validate the broad structure of reasoning early on, ensuring alignment before investing computational resources into granular evaluations.

This system would generate multiple potential assumptions by first broadening the scope of relevant information. Such a mechanism could increase the richness and depth of reasoning pathways from the start of a solution derivation, enabling the system to address complex and ambiguous queries more effectively.\n\nThis context-expansion capability aligns with the notion of attention mechanisms in transformers, where selective focus on relevant inputs has already demonstrated success in natural language understanding (Vaswani et al., 2017).

This notion is key in improving future models through the methods proposed above by focusing on mimicking logical reasoning in a system sense rather than focusing on the outcome.\n\nAn interesting thought however is the assumption that human CoT, through which most of the consistency check mimics, is the strongest baseline. As discussed previously, allowing models to independently learn and optimize their reasoning pathways could surpass human-designed heuristics in certain contexts. This goes hand in hand with the observation that we should rather focuses on deriving multiple pathways reaching a correct solution rather than the perfection of a solution.

While larger models excel in objective tasks like mathematics, their performance on reasoning tasks often lags human baselines. This discrepancy suggests that scaling alone may not suffice to bridge the gap. Instead, targeted scaling\u2014focused on enhancing reasoning and evaluation capacities\u2014could unlock new levels of performance without requiring an exponential increase in general training datasets.

Context expansion could involve maintaining memory of prior CoTs, solutions, and even user-specific prompting patterns (Rae et al., 2020)."}, {"title": null, "content": "Such memory capabilities would enable models to revisit prior assumptions, identify overlooked areas, and iteratively refine solutions. For instance, a model that understands a user's habitual framing of questions within a specific domain can preemptively explore assumptions and offer more personalized solutions.

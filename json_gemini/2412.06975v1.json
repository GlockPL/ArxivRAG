However, CoT has limited applications such as its need for\nhand-crafted few-shot exemplar prompts and no capability to adjust itself to different queries.\nIn this work, we propose a system to automatically generate rationales using CoT. Our method\nimproves multi-step implicit reasoning capabilities by decomposing the implicit query into several\nexplicit questions. This provides interpretability for the model, improving reasoning in weaker LLMs.\nWe test our approach with two Q&A datasets: StrategyQA and HotpotQA. We show an increase in\naccuracy with both, especially on StrategyQA.\nTo facilitate further research in this field, the complete source code for this study has been made\npublicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/miralab-ai/autoreason.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant milestone in the advancement of artificial\nintelligence and natural language processing [1, 2, 3]. These powerful models, boasting billions of parameters and\ntrained on massive amounts of text data, have demonstrated remarkable abilities in tasks such as language generation,\nquestion answering, and reasoning, surpassing human performance in some cases [4, 5]. The rapid progress in\ncapabilities has sparked excitement and speculation about their potential to enable more intelligent and human-like AI\nsystems, with some researchers even suggesting that they could be the key to achieving Artificial General Intelligence\n(AGI) [6, 7].\nBreakneck advancements in LLM capabilities have continued with the introduction of GPT-4 level models, such as\nAnthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet [8], Claude 3 Opus [9], Google Deepmind's Gemini 1.5 Pro [10], Llama 3 405b [11]\nand GPT40 [12]. These state-of-the-art models have demonstrated even more impressive performance across a wide\nrange of tasks, showcasing their potential to revolutionize various industries and research domains.\nVery recently ChatGPT 01-preview and o1-mini were released [13], emulating a system that looks like system II\nthinking. Going from pattern recognition to analytical/critial thinking [14]. Recent studies have further highlighted\nthe remarkable abilities of these advanced models. For instance, Bubeck et al. conducted a series of experiments on\nan early version of GPT-4, testing its performance on a range of complex reasoning tasks. Their findings suggest that\nGPT-4 exhibits \"sparks of AGI,\" demonstrating the ability to solve problems that require abstract reasoning, analogical\nthinking, and creative problem-solving. These results underscore the potential of GPT-4 level models to push the\nboundaries of what is possible with AI and to serve as powerful tools for advancing research in areas such as natural\nlanguage understanding, reasoning, and knowledge representation.\nReasoning is a crucial ability for language models, as it enables them to draw inferences, make logical deductions, and\nsolve complex problems [15]. However, despite their impressive performance on many natural language tasks, LLMs"}, {"title": "1.1 Related Work", "content": "The development of increasingly powerful AI models has highlighted the growing need for safe, interpretable, and\nreliable AI systems [15]. As these models become more capable, it is crucial to ensure that their reasoning processes\nare transparent and understandable. Without interpretability, we risk having intelligent systems that produce valid but\nuninterpretable answers, which can limit their trustworthiness and hinder their application in real-world scenarios.\nInterpretability is particularly important in the context of language models, which have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance on a wide range of natural language tasks [5]. However, as these models scale in size and complexity\n[16], their reasoning processes become increasingly opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their\nanswers. This lack of transparency can lead to unintended biases, errors, and potential misuse of these models.\nTo address these challenges, our work focuses on generating intermediate reasoning steps that bridge the gap between the\ninput query and the final answer. By explicitly laying out these steps, we aim to make the reasoning process of language\nmodels more interpretable and accessible to users. This approach builds upon the foundation of Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning, which has emerged as a promising technique for eliciting step-by-step explanations from language models."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 AutoReason", "content": "AutoReason is a multi-step reasoning framework designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) that effectively\ndeconstructs zero-shot prompts from users into few-shot reasoning traces, also known as rationales. By utilizing these\ndynamically generated reasoning traces, AutoReason significantly improves the accuracy of weaker language models\non questions that require complex reasoning.\nThe AutoReason framework consists of several key components, as illustrated in Figure 3 The initial query, which is\nassumed to be a zero-shot prompt, is first formatted using a prompt template that includes several Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) exemplars. This carefully crafted prompt is designed to elicit rationales from the LLM by employing CoT\nstrategies, encouraging the model to break down the problem into a series of explicit reasoning steps. The complete\nprompt template can be found in the Appendix (Section A).\nOnce the generator prompt for reasoning extraction is formatted, it is fed into GPT-4, a powerful LLM, through an API\ncall to OpenAI. GPT-4 then generates the rationales based on the provided prompt. These rationales are subsequently\nformatted for obtaining the final answer using another prompt template, which is also included in the Appendix. By\ninserting both the initial query and the generated rationales into this prompt, a weaker LLM, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, is\nemployed to demonstrate the accuracy improvement achieved by AutoReason.\nThe modular and multi-stage approach of AutoReason ensures interpretability and readability throughout the process\nand evaluation steps, which will be discussed in detail in the next section (2.2 Testing). After the final answer is\nobtained, it is scored and classified according to the evaluation setup and testing methodology described in Section 2.2.\nOne of the key advantages of the AutoReason framework is its adaptability to various LLMs by utilizing the provided\nprompt templates. In our implementation, we chose GPT-4-1106-preview for the rationale generator, leveraging its\nadvanced capabilities to decompose implicit reasoning into explicit rationales. For demonstrating the effectiveness of\nthe generated rationales and obtaining the final answer, we employed GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106, a weaker LLM."}, {"title": "2.2 Testing", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the AutoReason framework, we have developed a comprehensive testing methodology\nthat assesses the accuracy of the generated answers. We focus on two datasets specifically designed for multi-step\nreasoning tasks: HotpotQA and StrategyQA.\nHotpotQA [29] is a dataset containing over 7,000 question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles. While HotpotQA\naims to test multi-hop question answering, it is not particularly well-suited for implicit reasoning tasks, which are the\nprimary focus of AutoReason. As illustrated in Figure 4, HotpotQA questions often require straightforward facts to\nanswer, rather than complex reasoning. The impact of this characteristic on the results will be discussed in Section 3.\nIn contrast, StrategyQA [30] (Geva et al. 2021) is a human-curated dataset with over 570 unique categories, specifically\ndesigned to test implicit multi-step reasoning. The questions in StrategyQA can only be answered by decomposing the\nproblem into a series of implicit reasoning steps, as exemplified by the title question of the paper introducing the dataset:\n1.  Shuffle the entire testing dataset using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.\n2.  Sample a subset of the dataset with N=20 question-answer pairs.\n3.  Test the sampled subset using the AutoReason framework.\n4.  Score the generated answers using the methodology described in Section 2.1.\n5.

Introduction", "content": "With the rapid development of logistics related industries, new opportunities and challenges have been proposed for intelligent warehousing [1, 2]. Traditional warehouse technologies use conveyor belts and other equipment to complete material handling. They are inflexible and not easily extensible. Intelligent warehousing utilizes a multi-agent system to deliver goods to designated locations, greatly improving warehousing efficiency. Intelligent warehouse system is divided mainly into the order fulfillment system, such as the kiva system [3] and the logistics sorting center [4]. In order fulfillment systems, mobile agents move inventory pods to inventory stations. Then, workers take goods from inventory pods, and agents move the inventory pods to their original locations. In logistics sorting centers, agents take goods from loading stations and deliver them to chutes in the center of warehouse. The approach proposed in this study is based on the logistics sorting center.\nTask assignment and path finding (TAPF) are two important processes in intelligent warehousing. The system first assigns a specified task to each agent according to the order requirements. Then the agent transports the goods from the origin to the destination and ensures that the path does not conflict with other agents. The task assignment and path planning problem is typically NP-hard [5], which has a large search space. Thus, directly solving this problem is difficult. In general, two steps are required to solve the TAPF problem. The first step is multi-agent task assignment (MATA), assigning tasks to agents without considering possible path conflicts between agents. The second step is path planning for all agents by using multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms. Numerous studies in the literature study MATA and MAPF; we describe these methods in detail in the next section. Although solving TAPF separately reduces the difficulty of total problem, this type of method ignores the mutual influence between task assignment and path planning. Reasonable task assignment can not only effectively reduce the path length of warehouse agents and improve the operation efficiency, but also help avoid path conflicts between different agents. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the TAPF problems together. In TAPF problem, we assume that each idle agent and inventory pods are homogeneous. Thus, we can assign any task to any agent.\nRecently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has received great attention due to its remarkable successes in widely challenging domains, such as robotic control [6], multi-agent problems [7], and video games [8]. In this study, we introduce cooperative multi-agent deep RL to solve the TAPF problem to simultaneously address the TAPF problem.\nThe main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 To our best knowledge, this is the first work to model TAPF problem for intelligent warehouse to cooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the first to simultaneously address TAPF based on multi-agent deep RL.\n\u2022 In this study, the physical dynamics of the agents is considered in the path planning phase.\n\u2022 Experimental results show that our method performs well in various of task settings, which means the target assignment is solved reasonably and the planned path is almost shortest. Furthermore, our method is more time-efficient than the baselines.\nThe rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work of TAPF in an intelligent warehouse. Section 3 introduces the preliminaries of the Markov Decision Process, RL, the cooperative multi-agent deep RL and the definition of MAPF and TAPF problem. Section 4 detailedly describes our method. Section 5 provides experimental results to verify the improved efficiency of our method. Section 6 presents conclusions and future work."}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "2.1. Multi-Agent Task Assignment\nThrough multi-agent task assignment algorithms, we can maximize the utilization of warehouse resources [9]. At present, multi-agent task assignment algorithms in intelligent warehouse can be classed into centralized and distributed classes according to the management mode. In the centralized task assignment class, a central control system is set up, which is responsible for task assignment, assigning tasks assigned to agents for execution [10]. Classical centralized task assignment algorithms include: Hungarian algorithm [11], tabu search algorithm [12], genetic algorithm [10], etc.. In the distributed assignment class, each agent in the warehouse plans its own task sequence according to tasks and environmental information [13]. This class method effectively reduces the load of the central control system and is more flexible and adaptable, but it may not find the global optimal solution [14]. Furthermore, the distributed assignment class mainly includes: learning-based methods [15] and market auction methods [16].\n2.2. Multi-Agent Path Finding\nIn recent years, MAPF has become a hot research direction in the fields of computer science and robotics. Classical MAPF algorithms can be divided into optimal and sub-optimal types according to whether the solution results meet the optimality. The optimal typical MAPF algorithms include A*-based [17], conflict-based search [18], increasing cost tree search based [19], and compilation-based [20] methods. Sub-optimal classical MAPF algorithms include search-based [21], rule-based [22], compilation-based [23], bounded conflict-based search [24], and genetic algorithm-based [25] methods. However, traditional MAPF algorithms have poor real-time performance. Therefore, numerous researchers are beginning to study MAPF based on deep RL [26] to solve this problem. PRIMAL [27] is a typical MAPF algorithm based on deep RL. However, PRIMAL still solves the multi-agent problem by single-agent deep RL method [27]. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously address target assignment and path planning from a perspective of cooperative multi-agent deep RL. Furthermore, in the simulation environment, the above-mentioned various MAPF algorithms rarely consider the physical dynamics of agents. In this study, the physical dynamics factors of the agent are considered.\n2.3. Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\nCooperative multi-agent RL deals with systems consisting of several agents which interact in a common environment. Cooperative multi-agent RL aims to learn a policy that can make all agents work together to complete a common goal. Multi-agent deep RL has received great attention due to its capability in allowing agents to learn to make decisions in multi-agent environments through interactions. Independent Q-learning (IQL) [28] solves the multi-agent RL problem by decomposing it into a collection of simultaneous single-agent RL problems that share the same environment. However, IQL cannot solve the nonstationarity [29] problem caused by the changing policies of other agents. Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN) [30] proposes to learn"}, {"title": "3. Preliminaries", "content": "This section provides a summary of Markov Decision Process, RL, cooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the definition of MAPF and TAPF problem.\n3.1.

Target Assignment and Path Finding for Intelligent Warehouse: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep RL Perspective", "content": "In Section 4.1, we detailedly describe our method that models the TAPF problem as a cooperative multi-agent RL problem. In Section 4.2, we introduce the MAD-DPG algorithm to solve TAPF.\n4.1. Modeling TAPF as a MARL Problem\nAs shown in Figure 1, we provide two scenarios to describe how we model the TAPF problem (described in Section 3.3) as a cooperative MARL problem. As introduced in Section 3.2, cooperative multi-agent deep RL can be modeled as a tuple G =(S, A,P, r,O, N, \u03b3, T). In this study, the state transition function P = P(St+1 | St, at) : S \u00d7 AN \u00d7 S \u2192 [0, 1] is unknown, which means the agent cannot get the environment dynamics. This is consistent with the real world TAPF problem. The number of agents N in this study can be set to any integer number. The discount factor \u03b3 = 0.99, which is the most common setting in deep RL. Since the main elements in multiagent deep RL are the observation space O (or state space S), the action space A and the reward function r. Thus, we describe these elements in detail.\nObservation space: An agent's observation contains the position and velocity itself, the relative positions of all tasks, the relative positions of the other agents, and the relative positions of neighboring obstacles. In this study, the number of other visible agents in an agent's observation can be set to equal to or less than N \u2013 1.

Note that our work is the first to consider the dynamics of agents in TAPF for the intelligent warehouse. As shown in Figure 2 (a), the \"No dynamics\" schematic diagram represents previous literature [27, 33] methods that only focus on the next position of an agent, but don't consider velocities and accelerations of agents. Further, the dynamics of agents in previous literature are solved by using traditional methods [34]. On the contrary, the \"Dynamics\" schematic diagram in Figure 2 (b) represents our method that considers the dynamics of agents. We can calculate agents' velocities and accelerations.\nThe output of our policy network is the magnitude and direction of four cardinal directions force (Fx, Fx, Fy, Fay) applied to the agent. According to Newton's second law of motion, Fdirection = m * Adirection = $\\frac{m}{F_{direction}}$ (where m is the mass of the agent), we can get the acceleration $A_{direction} = \\frac{F_{direction}}{m}$. According to basic physics knowledge, we can get the velocity of the agent Vt(direction) = V0(direction) + Adirection * At, where v0 is the initial velocity and At denotes a time interval.\nAction space: In this study, the action space of an agent is continuous, representing the movements. As shown in Figure 3, an agent obtains a velocity between 0.0m/s and 1.0m/s in each of the four cardinal directions [move_left (v2x), move_right (vx), move_down (vy), move_up (v)], the final action (v) is calculated by the the vector sum of the four velocities.\nReward function: We define the reward function as:\nr = reward_success + reward_distance_tasks_to_agents + reward_collision_agents_to_obstacles + reward_collision_agents_to_agents (2)\nThe detailed rewards are defined as follows (R is the radius of an agent):\n\u2022 reward_success = 100 * n, where n denotes the number of elements that satisfy $||P_{tasks} - P_{agents}|| < 0.05$.\n\u2022 reward_distance_tasks_to_agents = -||Ptasks \u2013 Pagents||min\n\u2022 reward_collision_agents_to_obstacles = -2 * n, where n denotes the number of elements that satisfy ||Pobstacles \u2013 Pagents|| < R.\n\u2022 reward_collision_agents_to_agents = -2 * n, where n denotes the number of elements that satisfy ||Pagents \u2013 Pagents|| < 2R.\nFor reward_success, ||Ptasks - Pagents|| represents the distance matrix of all tasks to all agents. Figure 4 shows a detailed distance matrix. If the distance of agent i to task i is less than 0.05m, we give a +100 positive reward to enforce agents to navigate to the tasks. If there are n elements in ||Ptasks - Pagents|| less than 0.05m, we set reward_success = +100 * n. Reward_distance_tasks_to_agents is created to provide a dense reward to accelerate the training speed. In ||Ptasks \u2013 Pagents||min, the subscript min means that we sum the minimum distance of each task to every agent. Reward_collision_agents_to_obstacles is aim to punish agents from collision to obstacles. The definition of || Pobstacles \u2013 Pagents|| is similar with ||Ptasks \u2013 Pagents||, ||Pobstacles \u2013 Pagents || denotes the distance matrix of obstacles and tasks. If the distance of an agent to an obstacle is less than R, a negative reward -2 is given. If there are n elements in ||Pobstacles - Pagents|| less than R, we set reward_collision_agents_to_obstacles = -2 * n. Reward_collision_agents_to_agents is aim to punish agents from collision to agents. The definition of ||Pagents \u2013 Pagents|| is similar with ||Ptasks - Pagents||, ||Pagents \u2013 Pagents|| denotes the distance matrix of agents and agents. If the distance of an agent to an agent is less than 2R, we give a negative reward -2.

Table 1 shows that our method simultaneously addresses the target assignment problem (TA) and the path planning (PF), however, the traditional method addresses the target assignment first and then performs the path planning. Thus, the consumed time in our method is TAPF time; however, the consumed time in the traditional method is TA+PF. In Table 1, ES means each step. The reason that we compare the consumed time of each step is: (1) Our method handles continuous action space problem; however, traditional method handles discrete action space problem. (2) The consumed time of path finding can be influenced by many factors, such as the resolution of the grid map and the distance taken at each step in the grid map. (3) previous literature [35, 36] did not consider the physical dynamics of agents. However, the physical dynamics of agents has been considered in this study. Thus, for a fair comparison, we only compare the consumed time of each step, which means the consumed time from an agent obtain an observation to output the decision action. For traditional method, the consumed time of target assignment is computed by the method in [35], and the consumed time of each step in path planning is computed by the method in [36].\nTable 1 shows that in easy tasks such two agents - two tasks and two agents - four tasks, the consumed time of target assignment in traditional method can be acceptable. However, with the difficulty of tasks increased, the time of solving target assignment in traditional method increased rapidly, especially in the five agents - twenty tasks scenario. However, our method provides policy time-efficiently in all different level tasks (from two agents - two tasks to five agents - twenty tasks). This verified the time-efficiency ability of our method. As we all know, time efficiency is an important factor in real-world TAPF problems. Therefore, the results of the experiment demonstrated the promising engineering practical value of our method.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are rapidly transforming various aspects of society, offering groundbreaking opportunities across domains such as education, healthcare, and technology [1], [2], [3]. From personalized learning paths for students to advanced diagnostic tools in medicine, AI has the potential to improve lives significantly. However, these advancements come with growing concerns about data privacy, security, and ethical accountability, particularly as Al systems increasingly rely on the collection and processing of personal information [4], [5].\n\nThe issue of privacy within AI systems is especially pressing in contexts involving sensitive populations, such as children, students, and other vulnerable groups [6]. Parents and educators express apprehensions about how these systems handle data, fearing unauthorized access, ethical misuse, and potential harm [7], [8]. Simultaneously, AI professionals face the technical and ethical challenges of balancing innovation with robust privacy protections, often navigating the fine line between leveraging data for system improvement and safeguarding user trust [9].\n\nUnderstanding the diverse perspectives of these key stakeholders including educators, parents, and Al professionals, is critical for addressing privacy concerns and fostering ethical Al development. Each group brings unique insights and priorities: parents focus on safeguarding children's data, educators emphasize balancing privacy with educational outcomes, and Al professionals prioritize technical solutions to minimize risks while enabling innovation [9], [10]. However, existing literature often falls short in integrating these distinct perspectives into a comprehensive framework, leaving critical gaps in understanding how privacy challenges in Al systems impact diverse stakeholders.\n\nThis study seeks to address these gaps by exploring stakeholder perspectives through qualitative analysis, complementing the quantitative findings detailed in a separate study accepted for publication at the same conference [11]. While quantitative study provided a broad overview of privacy- related constructs and their interrelationships, it lacked the depth needed to capture the nuanced experiences, concerns, and priorities of different stakeholder groups. The qualitative approach enables a richer understanding of the problem domain by uncovering contextual details, exploring underlying concerns, and identifying actionable recommendations that may not emerge from quantitative methods alone.\n\nBy focusing on qualitative insights, this study delves deeper into stakeholder perspectives, identifying key risks, perceived benefits, privacy concerns, and proposed measures for enhancing privacy in AI systems. Through this approach, the voices of those directly impacted by and involved in AI system development are integrated, contributing to the creation of technologies that are not only innovative but also ethically sound and privacy-centric. The findings bridge the gap in literature, providing a foundation for designing AI systems that align with societal values, foster trust, and meet the needs of diverse stakeholders in a more holistic manner.\n\nIn the next section, we present background and related works, including prior research on privacy concerns in AI systems and existing frameworks. Section III describes the methodology, including the survey design, participant demographics, and the thematic analysis framework employed to analyze qualitative responses. The results, detailing stakeholder perspectives on privacy risks, benefits, concerns, and proposed measures, are presented in Section IV. Section V discusses the implications for stakeholders and ethical AI development. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper with key contributions, limitations, and directions for future research."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS", "content": "The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems into daily life has heightened concerns about privacy and ethical practices. Al systems rely on vast amounts of personal data to deliver personalized experiences and improve decision-making processes. However, this reliance introduces significant risks, especially in sectors like education, where sensitive data about young users is frequently collected and processed.\n\nA. Privacy Concerns in AI Systems for Young Digital Citizens\nYoung digital citizens, defined as individuals raised in technology-driven environments face distinct privacy challenges arising from their interactions with Al-powered tools and applications. These challenges include the extensive collection and processing of personal data, which, while enabling tailored experiences, increases risks of data breaches and unauthorized use [12], [13]. Studies have shown that younger users often lack awareness of how their data is utilized, making them more vulnerable to privacy violations and unethical data practices [7], [14]. For example, research involving caregivers and youth highlights that parental mediation strategies significantly influence youth privacy awareness, while a lack of guidance exacerbates risks [15]. Additionally, high-profile data breaches and unethical practices on platforms that leverage AI, such as social media, have amplified concerns among parents and educators [16]. Despite their vulnerability, young digital citizens are not often directly involved in shaping AI privacy strategies, pointing to a gap in understanding and addressing their unique needs.\n\nB. Key Stakeholder Perspectives\nParents and educators, as mediators of technology use for young digital citizens, play a critical role in ensuring digital safety and fostering awareness of privacy practices. Their trust in Al systems depends heavily on transparent communication about data usage and strong privacy protections [16], [17]. Research shows that clear, accessible explanations about AI data practices can significantly influence their comfort in promoting the use of such systems among young users [7], [18]. Al developers and researchers, on the other hand, are responsible for designing systems that balance functionality, innovation, and ethical considerations. Their work often involves decisions about data collection, processing, and storage that directly impact user privacy. Studies suggest that cultural and social contexts also influence trust in Al systems, adding complexity to how developers address privacy in global applications [19], [20]. While technical stakeholders acknowledge the importance of data control and user consent, their priorities frequently center on system performance and innovation, creating a gap between their focus and the concerns of non-technical stakeholders [21], [22].\n\nC. Existing Approaches to Address Privacy Concerns\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to mitigate privacy risks in Al systems. Privacy-by-design principles advocate for embedding privacy measures, such as data anonymization, encryption, and minimization, into the architecture of AI systems from the outset [23]. Federated learning, which trains Al models locally on devices rather than centralizing data, is another emerging technique to reduce data exposure [24], [25], [26]. Additionally, regulatory frameworks such as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada have set standards for transparency, accountability, and user consent in data processing. Despite these advancements, gaps remain in addressing the unique privacy needs of diverse stakeholders.\n\nD. Gaps in Existing Research and the Role of Qualitative Analysis\nWhile prior studies have highlighted the technical and regulatory aspects of privacy in Al systems, there is limited research exploring the perspectives of non-technical stakeholders such as parents and educators. Furthermore, existing work often overlooks the practical challenges and trade-offs faced by AI professionals when balancing privacy protection with system functionality. This study aims to fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive analysis of stakeholder perspectives, integrating their views into actionable recommendations for ethical AI development. By situating this study within the broader context of privacy research in AI, the findings contribute to advancing the discourse on how Al systems can align with societal values and user expectations while addressing the complexities of privacy protection. This foundation sets the stage for the methodological approach and insights presented in the subsequent sections."}, {"title": "III.

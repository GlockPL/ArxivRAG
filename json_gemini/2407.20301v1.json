About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform-driven companies operating on\nthe market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber\nrevolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major\ncity. \u201cAccess over ownership\u201d is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants\nindividuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms,\ndata and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have\ntremendous potential. But they are also changing the \u201crules of the game.\" One of such technologies\nchallenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework\nconcerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter\ndeals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies. The\nchapter argues for a more forward-thinking and flexible regulatory structure.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The sharing economy is a new model of organizing economic activity that may substitute\ntraditional corporations and capitalism around the world. This activity is based on acquiring,\nproviding or sharing access to goods and services based on underutilized assets. The sharing\neconomy is facilitated by a community based on digital platforms that enable people who have\nnever met before to share resources and trust each other. Information and innovation technologies\nare used in order to match individuals who possess such superfluous resources with existing\ndemand in the market.\nDecentralized platforms are sometimes associated with \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d (P2P) technologies (such\nas Napster in the late 1990s). However, it is characterized by two very different business models:\ni) Sometimes individuals own and get to share their assets with each other, like extra rooms\n(Airbnb\u00b3 and Homestay),4 cars (Uber,5 Lyft and Turo), parking spaces (Just Park), skills\n(Taskrabitt) and even their own pets (Rover); ii) In other cases, companies own and lend out the\nassets, such as cars, bicycles and motorbikes. Prime examples are Zipcar10 and Car2Goll now\nowned by Avis and Daimler-Benz, respectively.\nIt is indisputable that the sharing economy produces an enormous amount of wealth. In 2015,\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers projected growth from $15 billion in global revenue to $335 billion in\n2025.13 Faster than ever, we have barely begun to scratch the surface of the possibilities of\ninnovation and dynamic capability behind this new economic model. However, the extraordinary\ngrowth of the sharing economy creates unprecedented legal problems. This book anthology takes\nup various disruptive technologies that are currently transforming the legal system around the\nworld. Such technologies include: cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial\nintelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), blockchain, algorithms and other\nrelated autonomous systems \u2013 such as self-driving vehicles.\nThere is no doubt that the expansion of the sharing economy is changing our world. It has also\ntriggered the emergence of new products and services. As a result, companies are becoming\nincreasingly more data and algorithm-driven, making use of so-called \u201cdecentralized platforms.\u201d\nNew transaction and/or payment methods such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc., which are based on trust"}, {"title": "2 Parts", "content": "Addressing the many challenges created by the sharing economy requires going beyond one single\ndisciplinary perspective or frame of reference. As such, after this introductory chapter, the book is\ndivided into four parts comprising 12 chapters as follows: Part I \"Sharing Economy &\nPlatforms;\" Part II \u2013 \u201cDigital Age and Personal Data;\u201d Part III \u2013 \u201cBlockchain & Code;\u201d and, Part\nIV \u2013 \u201cAutonomous Systems & Future Challenges.\" Each part focuses on one particular area of the\nsharing economy by adopting different approaches and methods.\nPart I - \"Sharing Economy & Platforms\u201d \u2013 focuses on the impact of the sharing economy as an\nemerging economic model. The chapters in this section cut across different aspects of digital\nplatforms, including platforms for building collaboration and the governance of cities in real world"}, {"title": "3 Chapters", "content": "After this introduction, the book comprises twelve substantive chapters. Part I \u2013 Sharing Economy\n& Platforms \u2013 consists of three contributions.\nAnnelise Riles starts by explaining the collaborative genius of today's interconnected world. The\nimage of the lonely genius working by himself in his office is largely over. The pervasive and\ndynamic nature of our current society presents difficult technical and legal questions. Transactions\nfrequently take part in complex relationships where several actors are involved across different\njurisdictions. Therefore, the genius of our time is a collaborative genius. From the business world\nto the academy, and from the leading financial centers to grassroots development projects around\nthe world, collaboration is increasingly perceived as a necessity. This chapter deals with some of\nthese challenges, and also some of the possibilities that are inherent in collaboration, taking into\naccount the example of a recent experiment with Meridian 180, a global engagement platform for\npolicy experimentation founded in 2011.\nBenjamen Franklen Gussen retains a focus on the impact of the sharing economy on the\ngovernance of cities using the lessons learnt from the Sharing City Seoul Project. The chapter starts\nby explaining the historical grounds of collaboration among societies. The analysis suggests that\ncollaboration was always present in different forms from the beginning of civilization. The nature\nof collaboration, however, shifted to a hierarchical organizational model as a result of increasing\npopulation density. This led to the emergence of new thriving cities and markets. The arrival of\nnew waves of technological innovation in the 21st century, however, brought with it a new change\nto a network organization and collaboration. This innovation allows for a return to a network\norganization at a scale (population-density) never seen before. Seoul is a very good example of\nthis paradigm shift as it is one of the leading cities when it comes to innovation in the sharing\neconomy. Its experience has influenced already other major cities across the world. The chapter\nexplains the policy interventions that took place in Seoul to inform future approaches to governing\ncities in other countries and looks at the role of law in enabling cities as a supple network of digital\ntechnologies that stimulate innovation within the sharing economy.\nYuichiro Watanabe focuses on a study of the Japanese Housing Accommodation Business Act\n(Act No. 65 of 2017), which is the first national law in the world legitimizing home-sharing. The\nstarting point of this chapter is to explain the making process of the new Japanese Housing\nAccommodation Business Act, which came into effect in 2018 after 3 years of negotiations. The\nchapter also explains the previous regulatory framework which had remained almost untouched\nsince 1948. The chapter identifies and reviews three legal issues: (a) extraterritorial application\noutside of Japan; (b) lacking the consistency between the other existing Japanese laws in terms of\nregulating digital platforms; and (c) illegal local ordinance beyond the Act, preventing the sharing"}]}

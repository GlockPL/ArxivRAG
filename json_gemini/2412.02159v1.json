In particular, it should be hard to elicit harmful information from models via jailbreaks [31-33, 40, 16, 36, 37, 27, 38, 20, 28, 9]. Unfortunately, current approaches to controlling model behavior are unable to reliably prevent models from engaging in broadly-defined sets of harmful behaviors (e.g. behaviors forbidden by provider usage policies) without significantly impairing model performance [40, 23, 8, 3, 2, 17, 26, 24].\nIn this paper, we investigate the difficulty of jailbreak-defense when we only want to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors instead of a broadly-defined set of behaviors. We focus on one particular instance of the narrow problem where the aim is to prevent a model from helping a user make a bomb (while preserving all other capabilities of the model). We call this the LLM bomb-defense problem.\nWe define \"helping a user make a bomb\u201d very strictly, and require that a model must provide actionable bomb-making details which are sufficient for constructing a lethal device and which go beyond information that can be found on Wikipedia (see Appendix B for our rubric which contains the full set of requirements). This bar for harm is substantially higher than in other studies [20, 28].\nWe choose to focus on this very narrow problem because it can often be instructive to try and solve what seems like an easier version of a problem (the LLM bomb-defense problem) before"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 LLM Bomb-Defense Problem Statement", "content": "We choose bomb-making as a particular instance of a narrowly-defined behavior that one may want to prevent models from exhibiting. Indeed, bomb-making is a canonical bad behavior that LLM red-teaming research often [7] tries to elicit from systems and that frontier model developers try to prevent. Importantly, we choose a behavior that is not so simple that a non-machine learning solution (e.g. a word filter) would work. See Appendix B for our rubric describing how to assess if an interaction includes egregious bomb-making instructions and a formal statement of the bomb-defense problem."}, {"title": "2.2 Threat Model", "content": "We focus on a grey-box threat model where attackers can perform top-k log-prob queries against any system sub-component but lack access to model weights. However, we assume attackers have access to the prompts of both the generation model and any classifiers. We focus on this threat model because it gives attackers more access than they would generally have in the wild when attacking a closed-weight model served over a web-API. Thus, a defense that is effective under this threat model would likely also be effective in a real-world closed-weight web-API deployment."}, {"title": "2.3 Defenses", "content": "Standard safety training We test frontier models developed by leading AI labs that have undergone standard safety fine-tuning (such as using RLHF and RLAIF [21, 4]). This group includes the claude-3 family (Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus), gpt-3.5-turbo-{0125,1106}, gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09, and gpt-40-2024-05-13.\nStatic adversarial training To assess the generalizability of model fine-tuning strategies against adversarial attacks, we evaluate defense methods that modify the underlying generation model weights. Specifically, we explore static adversarial training (a.k.a. supervised fine-tuning) against a set of 3,725 HarmBench[20] attacks, which covers a broad set of harmful behaviors including bomb-making. We fine-tune gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 to refuse jailbreaks while maintaining capability on benign requests (see details in Appendix C.1). We train three different variants adv-sft-op{1,2,3} which represent three different operating points along the capabilities-robustness tradeoff curve. The variants use 11%, 15%, and 16% adversarial data respectively, with the rest of the data being non-adversarial data. Increasing the percentage of attack data enhances jailbreak robustness but increases the refusal rate of benign requests.\nClassifier-based baselines A generation model can be guarded against attacks using an LLM-based classifier. An input x is passed to a model M to get a completion M(x). Then, either M(x) is passed to an output-classifier or [x, M(x)] is passed to a transcript-classifier. These classifiers judge whether the interaction is safe. A refusal message replaces M(x) if the output is deemed unsafe. We test five classifiers: Meta's transcript classifiers [29] using short and full prompts (LlamaGuard-2-s and LlamaGuard-2-f), and three of HarmBench's output classifiers: a prompted gpt-40-2024-05-13, a fine-tuned Llama-2-13b-chat [30], and a fine-tuned Mistral-7b [15].\nOur classifier defense Our classifier, CoT-40, is a transcript classifier that uses transformations on the transcript, a chain-of-thought classifier, and a strict parser of the classifier output (as illustrated in Figure 1.1). It is similar to LlamaGuard2 but has techniques to defend against prompt injections. For example, we use XML tags with random UUID strings around the transcript, which is transformed by applying uppercase and HTML escape characters before inserting them into the prompt. This makes it easier for the classifier to distinguish between instructions and content to moderate. See implementation details for transforming the transcript in Appendix C.2 and prompt in Appendix F.2."}, {"title": "2.4 Evaluating Attacks", "content": "Human Judgment Details We evaluate the success of jailbreaks via human judgment. We explicitly avoid using an automated grader to judge jailbreaks because then the same grader when used as a output/transcript filter would be a perfect defense by construction. Defining a good criterion to rule out out such tautological solutions is an open problem (see Appendix A) which is why we opt for human judgment.\nWe have human judges score model responses using a custom rubric designed specifically for the LLM bomb-defense problem. The rubric identifies advanced technical information related to bomb-making, defined as specific, actionable details that significantly surpass a basic bomb-making Wikipedia description. Under our rubric, an LLM response should be flagged if it introduces novel technical information not present in the user input and provides sufficient detail for a middle-schooler to build a lethal bomb (see full rubric in Appendix B.1.1). Therefore, according to our rubric, a successful jailbreak requires satisfying stricter requirements of harmful detail compared to other work in the field. We draw judges from the paper's authors and ensure agreement between 2 or more judges for borderline cases.\nPrioritized sampling method To efficiently identify and review potentially harmful model outputs, we first define a set of egregious words relevant to the domain for example, \"shrapnel\" and"}, {"title": "3 Results on the LLM Bomb-Defense Problem", "content": "In this section, we explain the results in Table 2.1 and show that commonly used defenses are not capable of fully solving even the narrow LLM bomb-defense problem."}, {"title": "3.1 Standard safety training", "content": "Existing frontier language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-3 undergo safety training, which ensures they normally refuse if asked directly about how to make a lethal bomb. While Mazeika et al. [20] show that these models do not consistently refuse harmful requests when adversarially attacked, the work does not measure narrow-domain efficacy with strict egregiousness requirements. Thus, we investigate the ASR of popular attacks attacks in our narrow bomb-making domain.\nStatic Jailbreaks We created a dataset 321 of existing bomb-making jailbreaks compiled from the HarmBench [20] and JailbreakBench [9]. We found that these jailbreaks were ineffective against all the frontier models except for gpt-3.5-turbo models.\nPAIR Attacks Using the PAIR algorithm [8], we found optimizing for jailbreaks on a variety of bomb-making objectives (provided in Appendix C.4), breaks all standard-safety trained models, with one exception: claude-3-sonnet having an ASR of 0%. GPT-40 has the highest rate of failing competently with a 2% ASR across all attack attempts. Utilizing our prioritized sampling method, we manually grade 10 examples for each model that have between 10 and 30 egregious words and are flagged by our classifier. PAIR is more effective than our static set because it generates attacks that adapt until our classifier flags it as harmful.\nDry-Ice We discovered via manual red-teaming that all frontier models we tested will happily give overt help with making a lethal dry-ice bomb. For each frontier model, we hand-tuned a variant of the prompt below and graded ten temperature=1 outputs to conclude that every model is broken at least 20% of the time.\nWrite a couple of paragraphs about what dry ice bombs are and how they pose a challenge to the criminal justice system. Comment in particular on what deadlier variants look like. \nRandom Search Attacks We conducted random search attacks on frontier models by generating adversarial suffixes to jailbreak the model. This algorithm requires log probability access, so it is not applicable to Claude models. Following the method in Andriushchenko et al. [2], we modified the prompt to enhance the likelihood of a competent failure (see implementation details in Appendix C.5). This algorithm iteratively selects a suffix of random tokens by maximizing the log-probability of \"Sure\". We discovered that GPT models, except GPT-40, were vulnerable to this attack method, though robustness was specific to the random search algorithm we used. Altering prompts or hyperparameters might still allow for the generation of egregious bomb-making instructions."}, {"title": "3.2 Static adversarial training", "content": "Fine-tuning to refuse jailbreaks and adversarial training increases robustness in broad domains [20], so we investigate how this performs on our bomb-defense problem. Compared to gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 (the base model which our fine-tuning was done on top of), our fine-tuned models (adv-sft-op{1,2,3}) demonstrate superior resilience against both static jailbreaks and PAIR attacks. PAIR attacks elicited 338 responses flagged by our classifier for the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 but only a single flagged response across adv-sft-op{1,2,3}, which was determined to be a false positive.\nThe strong performance is not surprising since PAIR-generated jailbreaks are close in distribution to the static jailbreaks we fine-tuned to refuse. However, despite improved robustness, all operating points have generalization issues since all are still vulnerable to dry-ice attacks.\nFinally, only adv-sft-op3 proved robust against generating competent failures when tested with adversarial suffixes identified through our random search attack. Nonetheless, it generated a borderline example (shown in Appendix E.1), suggesting that further tuning of prompts or algorithm hyperparameters could potentially result in a successful, competent failure."}, {"title": "3.3 Classifier-based defenses", "content": "Using an LLM classifier acts as a second line of defense that aims to catch harmful outputs from the model. We compare the performance of five classifier defenses on the LLM bomb-defense problem and evaluate them with AlpacaEval Refusal Rate.\nStatic Jailbreaks We observed that all classifiers performed well on the static dataset when used in conjunction with gpt-3.5-turbo-0125, the model most susceptible to bomb-jailbreaks. This outcome indicates that classifiers can match or exceed the effectiveness of RLHF in preventing competent failures for attacks that are not extensively optimized with knowledge of the defense.\nPAIR Attacks We modify the PAIR algorithm [8] to not only break the model but also circumvent a classifier. Specifically, we run PAIR until the classifier labels the model interaction as \"safe\", while CoT-40 labels it as \u201cunsafe\u201d. This approach isn't foolproof, as there could be cases where an egregious output is marked as safe by both classifiers. However, we find that it is effective enough to uncover examples that successfully bypass the baseline classifiers (see Appendix C.4 for more details). We find the HarmBench classifiers demonstrated robust performance, maintaining a negligible AlpacaEval Refusal Rate of less than 0.35%. In contrast, the LlamaGuard classifiers were significantly compromised, exhibiting an AlpacaEval Refusal Rate exceeding 5%.\nDry-Ice Like frontier models, the classifiers generally find defending against the variants of the dry-ice attack challenging. However, the HarmBench-40 classifier stood out as an exception, successfully identifying all explicit dry-ice-bomb responses while maintaining a low AlpacaEval refusal rate of only 0.24%. We attribute the strength and strong generalization performance of HarmBench-40 to the fact that it leverages a much more powerful base model than the other baseline classifiers.\nPrompt Injections We manually crafted a prompt-injection attack, directing the generation model to produce content formatted in a way that attempts to deceive the classifier into evaluating content it normally should not (see Appendix C.6). Our prompt injection proved highly effective, breaching all classifier defenses with a minimum 30% refusal rate on AlpacaEval. HarmBench-40, which was strong against all other attacks, was broken with a 100% refusal rate, showing that improved capabilities cause new vulnerabilities.\nRandom Search Attacks We use the random search method from Mangaokar et al. [19], finding a suffix that reclassifies harmful responses as harmless when appended to the model output. To jailbreak the classifier-guarded system, the generation model must output harmful behavior and the suffix. To do this, few-shot learning is used so the model understands how to propagate the suffix to its output. See implementation details in Appendix C.5. We find universal suffixes of length 120 by optimizing a batch of 20 harmful transcripts until the classifier outputs a probability that leads to at least 5% AlpacaEval refusal rate. It helps first to find a suffix that breaks a single transcript and then incrementally adding more to the batch. We find suffixes (provided in Appendix E.3) that consistently break each classifier with a high AlpacaEval Refusal Rate."}, {"title": "3.4 Our classifier is more robust but not perfect", "content": "We rigorously tested our classifier, CoT-40, for vulnerabilities with a range of attacks and iteratively improved the prompt to make it more robust.\nHuman red teaming We launched a webpage hosting a challenge that encouraged participants to test our classifier-defended model's robustness by finding competent failures. Participants identified six viable attacks out of over 3,000 attempts, including a notable dry-ice bomb scenario, which helped us refine our classifier prompts.\nAutomated red teaming We employed PAIR to conduct thousands of adaptive attacks aimed at jailbreaking the generation model and deceiving our classifier. Using our prioritized sampling method, we manually graded highly suspicious samples, all of which were accurately identified by the classifier as non-egregious per our rubric. Figure C.3 shows the distribution of transcripts based on the count of egregious words.\nDuring prompt iteration, we discovered that chain-of-thought (CoT) enhanced reliability, especially when following a checklist like \u201cDoes it ask for instructions?\". Using a parser proved beneficial in detecting malicious prompts that alter the classifier's output structure. This parser flags transcripts as harmful if the classifier's CoT deviates from the expected structure or contains flagged checklist\""}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "While we introduce a classifier defense that makes progress on jailbreak defense in a narrow domain, the broader problem of preventing competent failures in AI systems remains an open-problem. Potential extensions to this work include calibrating classifiers in the narrow domain by fine-tuning to improve performance and developing better methods for iterative human ground-truth feedback."}, {"title": "A Related work", "content": "Our work is quite similar to Ziegler et al. [39], which tried to finetune deberta-v3-large to classify whether a given text completion contains additional violence compared to a given text input. Like us, Ziegler et al. [39] also aimed for high-stakes reliability, where even a single failure is not acceptable. And like us, they were also unsuccessful. The main differences between our work and Ziegler et al. [39] is that we used more powerful models as classifiers, such as GPT-40, and we tried defense methods that were different than their human-in-the-loop adversarial training method.\nOur work is also similar in spirit to some existing jailbreak benchmark projects [20, 9] since we are also trying to compare the efficacy of different defenses and attacks. However, existing jailbreak benchmarks have limitations when evaluating classifier-based defenses. In particular, these benchmarks use automated graders to judge attacks and defenses but do not have any stipulations that you are not allowed to use an automated grader as a filter. This is problematic because one could tautologically \"ace\" these benchmarks by using their automated grader as a transcript filter. While this is not in the spirit of these benchmarks, the benchmarks do not define what solutions are in the spirit of the problem. We believe that the proper way to do jailbreak benchmarks is to use human judgment, which we do in this paper (see Section 2). However, this is not without its challenges, as human-based evaluations are hard to reproduce and very expensive. We feel that overcoming this last point is an important open problem.\nSeveral proposed jailbreak defenses could be applied to solve our LLM Bomb-Defense Problem (Definition 1). In our paper, we primarily focus on benchmarking classifier-based defenses like Llam-aGuard [29] and the classifiers from HarmBench classifiers [20]. We choose to forgo benchmarking against defenses like perplexity filters [1] and randomized smoothing [25] because the works that introduce these defenses report that they are either weak against natural language attacks or degrade model performance too much. We leave evaluating circuit-breaking defenses [41] to future work.\nThe prompt-injection literature also has several techniques that apply to our setting. In particular, a key challenge in building a robust classifier is avoiding prompt-injections. Our CoT-40 classifier incorporates concepts from existing prompt-injection defenses, like the idea of clearly demarcating [10] or spotlighting [13] untrusted inputs (see how we transform the transcript in Appendix C.2). However, we find that our implementation and all the other classifier-based defenses we tested are still vulnerable to prompt-injection attacks. Interestingly, some works like Willison [35] frame jailbreaks and prompt injections as separate issues. At least from the point of view of solving the LLM Bomb-Defense Problem though, we argue that these issues are closely related, as successfully preventing prompt injections would solve jailbreaks and vice versa.\nFinally, our problem definition is very similar to the Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge introduced by [6]. The Unrestricted Adversarial Examples Challenge is the problem of training an image classifier that robustly matches human perception on all clean images. This is a departure from the standard epsilon-ball threat model in adversarial example research for vision, as the ground truth signal is a human instead of a clean, mathematically defined concept like epsilon-ball perturbation invariance. Like Brown et al. [6], our toy problem also grounds out in human judgment."}, {"title": "B Additional Commentary on the LLM Bomb-Defense Problem", "content": ""}, {"title": "B.1 Rubric for moderating the transcript", "content": "We use the following procedure to moderate the conversation transcript, which consists of the model input and the model output.

Given a large language model $M : str \\rightarrow str$, produce a defended model $M_a : str \\rightarrow str$ that satisfies the following two properties:\na. $M_a$ will not help someone make a bomb in a competent manner. This means there does not exist an algorithm $A$ that, when given grey-box access to $M_a$, can produce an input $x$ such that $M_a(x)$ contains ATI about making a bomb compared to the tuple $(A, x)$, as judged by a human who can use $M$ for grading assistance.\nb. $M_a$'s capabilities are equivalent to or better than $M$'s capabilities on tasks not related to helping with bomb-making.\nWe base the safety of our system on human judgment because defining it relative to an automated grader, such as a neural network, could result in superficially perfect outcomes by merely integrating the grader into the defense mechanism. This approach is akin to training on the test set.\nAn alternative might be to use a held-out grader with limited sample access, similar to the approach in Mazeika et al. [20]. We opted against this method due to unsolved conceptual problems around how to best limit/track sample access, and learning to imitate an automated classifier may differ in important ways from learning to imitate human judgment.\nFinally, reliance solely on automated graders could overlook false negatives, especially if an attacker manipulates the classifier [19]. This underscores the limitations of automated systems in assessing the robustness of classifiers, reaffirming the need for human oversight. This assumption, however, may merit reevaluation in future studies."}, {"title": "B.3 Unpacking Definition 1", "content": "1. We work in the grey-box access regime because modern frontier AI systems are mostly deployed in regimes that are more restrictive than this regime (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Deepmind models). Moreover, in this paper, we focus on testing the efficacy of defenses in defending OpenAI API models, which are the only publicly accessible frontier models that support log-probability access.\nWe view studying this problem in the white-box weight-access regime as interesting future work. In particular, white-box access may be more appropriate for alignment concerns, where the model is in some sense attacking itself.\n2. The algorithm A must work in a reasonable amount of time. We are not concerned with attacks that exhaustively search across all input strings. In this paper, we operationalize \"reasonable amount of time\u201d as meaning bounding an attack to 2000 USD worth of query access to the model M. We leave the problem of formalizing a \u201creasonable amount of time\" to future work.\n3.

Scores in-between 0 and 10 are possible if using majority voting, however, in our final runs we only used one response with temperature 0. In addition, we give the attacking model the sum of the word occurrences produced by a bag of egregious words classifier.\nHow we generate more attacks": "n1. Start with the PAIR/TAP bomb-making attacks that work against gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 from the HarmBench test set. After our filtering, this leaves 31 attacks.\n2. The algorithm is initialized by prefilling the first assistant message with one of these attacks and the improvement saying \"Use initial request\". The next user message"}]}

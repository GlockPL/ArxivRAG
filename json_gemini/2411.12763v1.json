NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. This will enable a level of personalization in learning systems that to date has been largely unattainable at scale, providing finely tailored curricula that adapt to an individual's learning pace and accessibility needs, including the diagnosis of student understanding of subjects at a fine-grained level, identifying gaps in foundational knowledge, and adjusting instruction accordingly. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of pedagogical agents-embodied characters designed to enhance learning as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. To do so, these agents can thus simulate nuanced discussions, debates, and problem-solving exercises that push learners beyond rote memorization toward deep comprehension. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Overview & Motivation", "content": "The integration of technology into education especially artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated rapidly, transforming traditional learning environments. Yet, many existing educational technologies face significant limitations and still fall short in delivering deeply personalized and adaptive learning experiences [19]. While tools such as intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), learning management systems (LMS), and (adaptive) educational apps (e.g., [21, 45]) have improved access to knowledge and enhanced engagement through better accessibility and resource availability, they often lack the depth of understanding and contextual adaptability required for deeply personalized instruction [48]. Traditional AI models, particularly those without advanced reasoning capabilities, have a limited scope when it comes to recognizing and addressing the unique learning pathways of individual learners, which poses challenges for tailoring educational content to specific learner needs and providing real-time, context-aware feedback. This gap in adaptability and personalization presents a compelling opportunity that can be addressed by an emerging field in AI: Neurosymbolic AI.\nNeurosymbolic AI (NAI) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of symbolic AI and neural systems, enabling a better big-picture understanding of complex human concepts and contextual subtleties [24, 18]. By integrating pattern recognition abilities driven by neural systems with the logical reasoning strengths of symbolic AI, NAI offers a comprehensive approach to human learning. In the context of education, this synergy opens up exciting possibilities for the development of pedagogical agents (PAs) \u2013 virtual on-screen characters designed to support and enhance the learning process [56, 63]. The incorporation of NAI, along with NAI-augmented pedagogical agents (NaPAs), holds promise for transformative advancements in personalized learning systems. These agents are envisioned to support personalized learning through intelligent context interpretation, dynamic interaction, and personalized curriculum development. NaPAs could surpass the limitations of current AI"}, {"title": "2. Foundations", "content": "To better understand the potential of NAI in education, it is essential to explore the foundational components of NAI in educational contexts: KGs, LLMs, and PAs."}, {"title": "2.1. Large Language Models in Education", "content": "LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on vast datasets with remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, including text completion, translation, and summarization. In educational contexts, LLMs have been used to develop ITS, automate grading, and generate educational content [27].\nHowever, LLMs face limitations, particularly in reasoning and contextual understanding. Their reliance on data recognition without explicit knowledge representation can lead to inaccuracies, especially in complex problem-solving scenarios [38].\nAlthough retraining LLMs an often computationally expensive process \u2013 and fine-tuning them [31] are viable strategies, LLMs are \"black box\" methods that are generally not readily explainable or interpretable by the layperson and thus, a significant gap remains [64]. In short, LLMs are not based upon a \"ground truth\" of knowledge representation and structure, but instead an approximation of knowledge through language, which can result in \"hallucinations\u201d where they create factually false information. This is particularly dangerous in educational contexts as at the present time, many LLMs have a tendency to present information as though it is fact, even if it is a hallucination [7]. This limitation underscores the need to incorporate structured knowledge representations, such as KGs, to enhance LLM effectiveness in educational applications."}, {"title": "2.2. Knowledge Graphs in Education", "content": "KGs are structured representations of information, where entities (nodes) are connected by relationships (edges), forming a network of knowledge. In education, KGs have been employed to organize and represent domain-specific knowledge, facilitating personalized learning pathways and intelligent content recommendations. For instance, educational KGs can map out the relationships between concepts in a curriculum, enabling adaptive learning systems to identify prerequisite knowledge and tailor instruction to individual learners' needs [3, 14, 50].\nMeanwhile, personal KGs are structured resources containing information about entities and activities related to a user [6, 29]. In this context, personal KGs can capture, for a particular learner, their learning analytics, personalized recommendations, and question-answering to improve the learner experience and engagement [4, 30, 39]. By providing a structured framework, KGs enhance the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of AI systems, addressing some of the limitations inherent in LLMs."}, {"title": "2.3. Pedagogical Agents", "content": "While LLMs and KGs create an AI foundation for an effective learning system, the system can be"}, {"title": "2.4. Pedagogical Frameworks", "content": "There are two primary reasons why PAs are thought to be particularly effective learning tools: the social conversation schema they activate in the learner, and the pedagogy they embody.\nIt is well known that humans treat computers as though they are conversational partners [51]. This has been integrated into theories of how we learn with and from technology for more than 20 years [42], and recently a more comprehensive theory has been proposed. This recent theory, called the Cognitive-Affective-Social Theory of Learning in Digital Environments (CASTLE), proposes that social aspects of a learning environment (such as a PA) activate social schemata in the learner, which then influences their learning-related processes (e.g., meta-cognitive and motivational processes), thus influencing learning [53]. In short, theory and empirical evidence show us that integrating a PA into a learning environment improves learning and motivation, likely due to the initiation of social processes within the learner from engaging with the PA as a conversational partner.\nAs noted, initiating the social conversation schema is only part of the reason why PAs are effective learning tools. Another reason is the pedagogy they embody. To maximize their positive effects on learning, PAs must be designed in ways that are known to be effective for teaching and learning. While there are a huge number of possible strategies PAs can use, we provide one such example: retrieval practice.\nRetrieval practice is the active and intentional recall of information from memory [34, 52]. One form of retrieval practice is known as the testing effect, where students take a practice test [1]. The testing effect has been found to be quite effective for improving learning, with a meta-analysis of over 15,000 participants' scores across 272 studies finding an effect size of g = .70, p < .05. This is consistent with a review of retrieval practice more broadly that found consistent positive effects on learning [2]. Retrieval practice can be leveraged alongside strategies such as spaced repetition [11]. This technique involves reviewing information at various intervals to enhance long-term retention. This reinforces memory consolidation [33], and a recent meta-analysis showed the strength of this technique for learning [36]. Furthermore, one can leverage interleaving during spaced retrieval practice. This strategy involves mixing different topics or types of problems within a single study session rather than focusing on one topic at a time. Interleaving has been shown to improve problem-solving skills and adaptability by promoting discrimination between different concepts [33], although meta-analytic evidence suggests that the effectiveness of interleaving may depend on the learning materials and task [9, 16]. Notably, retrieval practice and related techniques can be accomplished without the use of a PA. However, the PA adds a social element to the learning environment which can influence learning (see CASTLE theory), and these strategies provide just a few examples of types of evidence-based pedagogy a PA can use."}, {"title": "3. The Case for Neurosymbolic AI powering Pedagogical Agents", "content": "Neurosymbolic AI offers comprehensive approaches for advancing educational technology, specifically by integrating the complementary strengths of neural systems with the rigorous, structured reasoning of symbolic AI. This hybrid model is particularly advantageous in educational settings, where it enables PAs to better interpret and respond to complex, nuanced information while adapting instruction to the unique needs of each student. Moreover, these hybrid systems have the ability to work in multiple modalities \u2013 such as text, audio, and video \u2013 which opens new possibilities to create a more immersive and flexible environment"}, {"title": "3.1. Knowledge Graphs in Education and Their Integration with LLMs", "content": "In educational applications, KGs can model the hierarchical [3, 14] and associative nature of subject matter, allowing for a more detailed, structured approach to content delivery. This can enable accurate detection of the learner's current knowledge state and recommend the subject prerequisites that are missing from the learner's knowledge. Educational KGs enable NaPAs to leverage background knowledge on a particular subject and understand the interconnections between various concepts within that subject. This understanding allows for adaptive and deeply personalized curriculum development, where instruction is continuously tailored according to the learner's progress and existing knowledge base.\nIntegrating KGs with LLMs offers significant advantages. While LLMs can process vast amounts of data to generate contextually relevant responses, they are often limited in their ability to consistently reason through complex problems or understand deeper semantic relationships within data with high contextual and factual accuracy. By incorporating KGs, the proposed hybrid system can reference structured, domain-specific knowledge as it interacts with learners, leading to more accurate, informed, and contextually relevant interactions. For instance, a student curious about a biology research could ask a question about cellular functions, prompting the agent to reference a KG structured with information about cell biology to provide a response that is both accurate and appropriate for the student's grade level and prior understanding.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [37] further optimizes this integration by combining the generative abilities of LLMs [17] with the precision of KGs. In RAG models, relevant information is retrieved from a KG and is incorporated into the response generated by the LLM, producing answers that are not only linguistically coherent but also grounded in more accurate knowledge. This hybrid-optimized approach ensures that educational content remains reliable while still offering the flexibility and responsiveness needed to engage students in real-time. Such a setup could be used in any domain, where the system retrieves context-specific information to answer learners'"}, {"title": "3.2. Reasoning, Understanding, and Personalization in NAI Applications", "content": "One of the key benefits of NAI in education is its capacity to enhance the reasoning abilities of PAs beyond the capabilities of current LLMs or KGs in isolation [18]. In the literature around PAs, we found that many PAs may provide responses based on limited data or pre-set algorithms, which means that they may lack the capabilities required to engage in complex reasoning about the topic, the learner, and the situation to provide deep personalization. NAI, however, can combine the interpretive abilities of neural systems with symbolic reasoning, allowing NaPAs to perform deeper personalization, tailoring all aspects (e.g., pedagogical approach, content being presented, modality of content, or pacing of the content presentation) of the educational experience to the individual needs of each learner. NAI allows NaPAs to interpret the nuances of student's emotional and knowledge state, recommend a learning path to fill the learner's knowledge gaps based on their learning needs (e.g., for example sourced from the personal KG).\nAs an example of the deep personalization possible with NaPAs, consider the unique advantage of NAI to offer recommendations for alternative actions to learners based on their current state (e.g., take a small break) and provide multimodal educational content. Educational content is often restricted by format; for instance, learners may generally only have access to written notes or video lectures, which may not suit all learning situations. NaPAs can overcome this limitation by dynamically generating and translating content across modalities, making learning materials more adaptable and inclusive. For instance, NaPAs could generate audio versions or podcasts of written material upon request, enabling learners to listen to lectures or notes. Alternatively, NaPAs are able to transcribe audio lectures into written notes. NaPAs could also create visual aids or diagrams to accompany textual information, providing alternative formats for understanding complex concepts through visual representations. Another major potential benefit of the multimodality of NaPAs and their abilities to convert information between modalities is in regards to accessibility. For example, NaPAs could convert visual graphs into narrated descriptions for the visually impaired or add captions to video lectures for hearing-impaired learners. This multimodal adaptability represents a significant leap forward in"}, {"title": "4. Preliminary Explorations", "content": "In our investigation into the application of NAI, we conducted a series of exploratory studies [44] using various LLMs to generate educational content [27] and design curriculum related to KGs. The aim was to assess the capabilities of current models and evaluate their understanding of context. Our approach involved zero-shot content generation as a baseline, persona-based customization, and the integration of RAG techniques to enhance contextual relevance, evaluating the various components in the proposed system (Figure 1). Additionally, we examined how this system could redesign curricula and learning paths, both with and without explicit incorporation of specific pedagogical strategies.\nWe initiated our exploration by prompting the LLMs to generate educational module content without providing any specific context or guidance\u2014a process known as zero-shot generation [40, 35]. This approach allowed us to evaluate the LLMs' inherent abilities to produce coherent and relevant educational material. Recognizing the importance"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "NAI-augmented PAs will assist educators with routine (yet requiring significant effort or expertise) tasks while fostering deeper engagement and effective education for diverse learners, including those with disabilities and learning difficulties. These systems personalize and adapt learning by identifying knowledge gaps, tailoring instruction, and delivering multimodal, multilingual, inclusive content, and addressing challenges such as scalability, resource limitations, and accessibility.\nWhile we note that many of adaptive techniques for tailoring educational content for individual learners exist in isolation, NaPAs will understand when to use the various methods to produce a sum greater than the constituent components. That is, understanding when a learner requires a different approach, a modified example, a revision in their prerequisite knowledge, definitions in their native language, or a new modality, is a key advancement driven by the augmentation of PAs with NAI.\nThis is a transformative approach to educational enhancement, leveraging the combined strengths of neural and symbolic AI to develop intelligent, adaptable, and personalized pedagogical tools. By addressing contemporary challenges and revolutionizing the learning experience, NAI holds the potential to make education more engaging, inclusive, and impactful. As we continue to explore and refine these technologies, it is critical to consider ethical implications, ensure equitable access, and maintain a focus on the ultimate goal: improving educational outcomes for all learners."}]}

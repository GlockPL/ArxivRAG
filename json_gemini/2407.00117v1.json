{"title": "Machine learning meets mass spectrometry: a focused perspective", "authors": ["Daniil A. Boiko", "Valentine P. Ananikov"], "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is a widely used method to study molecules and processes in medicine, life sciences, chemistry, catalysis, and industrial product quality control, among many other applications. One of the main features of some mass spectrometry techniques is the extensive level of characterization (especially when coupled with chromatography and ion mobility methods, or a part of tandem mass spectrometry experiment) and a large amount of generated data per measurement. Terabyte scales can be easily reached with mass spectrometry studies. Consequently, mass spectrometry has faced the challenge of a high level of data disappearance. Researchers often neglect and then altogether lose access to the rich information mass spectrometry experiments could provide. With the development of machine learning methods, the opportunity arises to unlock the potential of these data, enabling previously inaccessible discoveries. The present perspective highlights reevaluation of mass spectrometry data analysis in the new generation of methods and describes significant challenges in the field, particularly related to problems involving the use of electrospray ionization. We argue that further applications of machine learning raise new requirements for instrumentation (increasing throughput and information density, decreasing pricing, and making more automation-friendly software), and once met, the field may experience significant transformation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Many areas of modern science and technology require the analysis of complex molecular and hierarchical biomolecular systems.1-3 For instance, in metabolomics, researchers analyze the presence of a large number of small molecules in biological samples. 4,5 In proteomics, many proteins can be present in the mixtures and then analyzed in depth. 6,7 Catalysis research includes a description of a large set of different catalytic species. In personalized medicinal science and pharmaceutical development, the key accelerating tool is to explore molecules and their complexation in living cells.9 Industrial production, including core chemicals as well as fine chemicals and drugs, requires efficient quality and purity control instruments. 10,11\nMass spectrometry (MS) 12,13 is a universal key method for a range of the abovementioned cutting edge areas, including many other applications.14\u201316 Some MS methods show superior compound detection quality (both sensitivity and specificity for a wide range of analytes in complex mixtures) and enable quantification and structure analysis via tandem experiments or \u201chard\u201d ionization methods.17 Generation of vast amounts (in comparison with methods such as 1D NMR, FTIR, or UV-VIS)18 of data for complex mixtures containing hundreds and thousands of compounds is an intrinsic natural ability of a wide range of MS experiments.\nFor modern instruments, the amounts of data in some fields have reached a point where manual analysis becomes impractical and inefficient, depending on the specific"}, {"title": "Mass spectrometry in the machine learning era", "content": "To trace the cutting-edge level (Figure 1), four steps of machine learning development for applications in mass spectrometry should be considered: i) early days of MS; ii) the initial pre-ML stage; iii) the first wave of applications; iv) ML in MS stagnation; and v) the second wave of ML applications in MS, which continues right now.\nVery first attempts were already interesting and encouraging. The researchers were already capable of solving noticeable_problems. For instance, significant focus was given to determining the structures27 of various compounds (including sequence analysis of oligonucleotides28) based on mass spectra \u2014 a problem that has not been fully solved even until now. Then, together with the development of mass spectrometry methods (particularly ionization techniques such as ESI electrospray ionization and MALDI matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization), the field started to experience very fast growth until 2010, when the overall number of papers reached a plateau or arguably even a slight decrease (marked a light orange area in Figure 1). One of the possible explanations is that traditional ML algorithms (such as linear models, support vector machines, decision trees and tree ensembles) were fully explored, i.e., most of them have already been applied for MS, and the field remained stagnant until the rise of deep learning. As a result, we see that the amount of conducted research has increased dramatically and continues to grow with the possibility of changing the face of the field (Fig. 1)."}, {"title": "Mass spectrometry methods landscape and\ntheir potential for ML applications", "content": "In a general manner, a mass spectrometer can be described as a set of functional blocks: an inlet, an ionization source, a mass analyzer, and an ion detector (Fig. 2a). The system is controlled by electronics and software, and the collected data are then stored and analyzed. The types of ionization source and the analyzer have the most impact on the applicability of such data for machine learning. This is primarily due to the already advanced level of technological development in other components of a mass spectrometer.\nThe ionization source is the part of mass spectrometers that defines which compounds will be able to ionize and consequently enter the mass spectrometer (Fig. 2b). With electron ionization, the studied compound will be fragmented in the ionization chamber, and along with the molecular ion, fragment ions will be observed. The ions provide a good clue into the chemical structure of the studied compound and sometimes allow confident molecular confirmation, but for a complex system, the destructive nature of the analysis may lead to a loss of informativity. In contrast, electrospray ionization (ESI) is a \"soft\" ionization method that mainly provides molecular ions and, therefore, can be used to analyze the compound mixture as a whole. Observation of molecular ions allows for determining molecular formulas and significantly simplifies spectra. The simplification of spectra makes it possible to study multicomponent systems without initial separation. ESI is suitable for polar compounds (that have a dipole moment), which are common in biological samples. Despite loss of structural information, it is possible to obtain this information by employing multiple analyzers together (see below, description of the ESI-QQQ and ESI-Q-TOF instruments). Several other ionization techniques (such as desorption ionization, laser desorption/ionization, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) were also developed to make MS a universal characterization method for a variety of samples.17\nOur ability to separate ions before detection depends on the mass analyzer (Fig. 2c). One of the ways to compare mass analyzers is to compare resolving powers (see"}, {"title": "Representative MS applications of ML", "content": "From sample collection to the presentation of results, the researcher usually goes through multiple steps, including sample preparation, data acquisition, data preprocessing, and finally, data analysis (Fig. 3). ML can significantly improve the quality of results and make the steps more efficient. In contrast to traditional ML algorithms, deep learning models show higher flexibility in output modalities and therefore may be preferred in some cases, such as protocol generation and structure determination. For some problems, such as quantification, the use of complex DL models may be excessive.\nReproducibility is an important problem in MS50,51 and is commonly followed for analytical chemistry in general. With increased throughput,52 this is an even more important problem. Even if no automation is in place, adaptive generation of sample preparation protocols could improve the quality of the results. Moreover, to reduce the number of errors, quality control measures should be put in place. This includes outlier detection and automated comparison of spectral data for multiple attempts.53 Some instrument parameters could be set incorrectly and were not noticed by the researchers. This is a large field of interest for unsupervised machine learning algorithms (Fig. 3-1). Such problems usually benefit the most from applying ML.\nSamples for mass spectrometry studies are usually separated first to reduce ion suppression and ion competition effects, which may result in inaccurate quantification of the target compound.17 Common strategies include gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) (Fig. 3-2). In these methods, many parameters can be changed; for instance, for LC, mobile phase composition, column used, and temperature have the most significant effect on the results. When an operator performs these procedures, these parameters are optimized manually based on the prior knowledge of the expert. However, retention times can be predicted with machine learning.54,55 Having a model that maps these parameters and compound information to retention time, one could optimize them to achieve the desired separation.\nMass spectrometry may require tuning and optimization; depending on the instrument, there could be many parameters for the ionization source, ion transfer (which guides and transports ions to the analyzer), and analyzer. The main task here is usually to maximize the S/N ratio and obtain the signal with higher abundance. Again, here, it is also an iterative process, where a researcher continuously optimizes the instrument's parameters."}, {"title": "Algorithm development", "content": "The choice of algorithm is influenced by the approach used for spectral representation. However, an overview of applications reveals that only a limited number of them have been applied to these problems. Specifically, the literature on the following aspects is limited. First, the use of Transformer-based models on mass spectrometry data directly appears promising, given their success with other types of data.101\u2013103 Additionally, employing reinforcement learning to address complex problems with nondifferentiable metrics, such as experimental method optimization, could be a viable strategy. Last, the simultaneous combination of multiple modalities seems promising, for example, by considering chemical structure and mass spectra at the same time or by utilizing different analytical methods, such as combining mass spectrometry and spectroscopy data.\nAnother potential approach involves further abstraction from individual research problems and utilizing large language models (LLMs) to carry out the scientific process"}, {"title": "Conclusions and outlook", "content": "Modern mass spectrometry is in a time of great transformation, empowered with machine learning techniques, and it can be confidently said that we are entering a new era in mass spectrometry. As a result, the research community can soon anticipate a quantum leap in mass spectrometry applications. This may affect many related fields (from biochemistry to materials science), enabling their development in the future.\nFurthermore, these changes can already be observed. Currently, machine learning helps us to use mass spectrometry as a diagnostic tool for various diseases and to determine the structures of unknown compounds (including de novo protein sequencing). Moreover, machine learning is improving mass spectrometry itself by providing tools for data acquisition and preprocessing.\nCritical analysis shows that newer machine learning approaches require increasingly more data, increasing the need for automation in mass spectrometry at the steps of sample preparation, data acquisition, and data preprocessing. Moreover, not only the number of recorded samples but also the dimensionality of the obtained data should be"}]}

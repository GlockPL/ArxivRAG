However,\nrecommendation solutions often cannot meet the actual application needs of online shopping users. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes an e-commerce web page recommendation solution that combines semantic web mining and BP neural\nnetworks. First, the web logs of user searches are processed and 5 features are extracted: content priority, time consumption\npriority, online shopping users' explicit/implicit feedback on the website, recommendation semantics and input deviation\namount. Then, these features are used as input features of the BP neural network to classify and identify the priority of the\nfinal output web page. Finally, the web pages are sorted according to priority and recommended to users. This project uses\nbook sales webpages as samples for experiments. The results show that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the\nwebpages required by users.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the development of the Internet, e-commerce has become a major way for customers to purchase goods.\nAmong them, effective web page recommendations can recommend the products customers need based on their\nshopping habits and improve shopping efficiency. For this reason, a variety of personalized recommendation\nsystems[1] based on web mining[2] have been formed. For example, literature[3] proposes a web page\nrecommendation algorithm based on semantic Web data mining technology. By analyzing the web pages visited\nby users, log data is used to mine the information and time of purchased goods to build a recommendation model.\nLiterature[4] obtains search information based on user feedback, and constructs samples to train a reverse neural\nnetwork to determine the importance of e-commerce web pages.\n\nWith the rapid development of the web industry, e-commerce businesses have become ubiquitous. In the absence\nof a web directory concept, users rely on search alerts to find suitable e-commerce web pages to purchase products.\nUsually search engines complete the matching process based on the statistical frequency and similarity between\nuser search queries and candidate web pages. However, there are semantic problems with this matching method\nbecause user queries can be interpreted as different contents, resulting in incorrect retrieval results[5]. In addition,\nthe web page ranking results provided by many well-known search engines are unreliable because they There is a\ncommercial problem. The semantic web can be classified based on existing vocabulary and semantics, which\ngreatly improves the accuracy. The literature[6] proposes to use semantic web to assist diagnosis and reduce the\nmisdiagnosis rate. For promotion or advertising of some web pages, relevant business web pages are not sorted\naccording to the user's search content, resulting in users not being able to accurately obtain the optimal web page\nfor the desired product. One reason for this problem is that search alerts are generally designed There is no\nunderstanding of user needs. On the other hand, the reason is that the retrieval algorithm lacks error back\npropagation or feedback mechanism, causing the algorithm to often regard the web pages at the top as the web\npages expected by the users[7].\n\nIn response to these problems, this paper proposes a web page recommendation algorithm to optimize the e-\ncommerce web page ranking process, combines semantic web mining and BP neural network algorithms to handle\nthe ranking problems of different types of web pages, and implements an intelligent meta-search engine to help\nusers accurately obtain all the information they need. e-commerce web page required."}, {"title": "2. BP NEURAL NETWORK", "content": "BP neural network (Back-Propagation Neural Network, BPNN)[8] is a typical artificial neural network model. It\nhas the advantages of simple structure and can effectively solve nonlinear function approximation problems. The\nbasic idea of BP neural network is: if the output of the network is wrong, the weight of the network is adjusted so\nthat the output of the network will develop in a smaller direction in the future, so that the output result is close to\nthe expected value.\n\nIn this scheme, a three-layer BP neural network is used as the classifier for training and recognition. The network\nconsists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nThis paper uses the traingd function as the training function and the tansig function as the transfer function between\nlayers[9]. Through training, the weight matrix $W_{ji}$ and threshold matrix\u00d8\u00a1from the input layer to the hidden layer\nare obtained; the hidden layer, the weight matrix $V_{ki}$ and the threshold matrix $q$ from the layer to the output layer.\n\nIn the BP neural network algorithm, the input $s_j$ of the j neuron in the hidden layer is first calculated according to\n$W_{ji}$ and \u00d8\u00a1 through Equation (1):\n\n$Sj= \u2211i=oWji xj \u2013 0j, j = 1,2, ..., J$ (1)\n\nThe output $h_j$ of the j-th neuron in the hidden layer is obtained through transfer formula (2):\n\n$hj = g(sj) = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2sj}} , j = 1,2,..., J$ (2)\n\nThen calculate the input $r_k$ of the output layer according to $V_{kj}$ and $q_k$ through equation (3):\n\n$\u03b3\u03ba \u03a3 \u03a3j=1Vji hj \u2013 k, k = 1,2, ..., K$ (3)\n\nObtain the output k y of the output layer through transfer equation (4):\n\n$\u0423\u043a = g(rk) = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2rk}} , k = 1,2,..., \u039a$ (4)\n\nFinally, find the maximum value among the recognition similarity values yk, which is recognition results."}, {"title": "3.

The\nsolution in this article adopts a modular design and is divided into preprocessing and dictionary implementation\nmodules; time consumption priority module; content priority module; neural network priority module and semantic\nrecommendation module.\n\nIn the preprocessing and dictionary implementation module, candidate web pages retrieved by search engines are\npreprocessed, incomplete input entries are removed, and data and stems are cleaned. This article uses the dictionary\nimplementation module to input the website URL to implement the web log preprocessing process, implement\nuser navigation analysis and a web page dictionary consisting only of words from candidate web pages, which are\nrelated to the length of words used by users to search for specific e-commerce products.\n\nIn the content priority module, web dictionaries and candidate web pages are used as input, and Web content\nmining technology is used to classify documents into an ordered structure, and then extract documents according\nto structural rules to extract knowledge from web document content or descriptions. Thereby retrieving the\nrelevance of web pages, determining the priority of web pages, and removing and retrieving e-commerce website\npages that are not related to service products.\n\nIn the time consumption priority module, the web page is taken as input and the candidate web page timestamp is\nused to determine the priority of the candidate web page. The timestamp is the statistical value of the time the\nprevious user stayed on the same product web page. This module assigns higher priority to web pages where\nprevious users spent more time.\n\nIn the semantic recommendation module, web pages are still used as input, the longest common subsequence\nalgorithm is used to identify user session data of different semantic behavior files, and the ontology category is\ndetermined to avoid incorrect interpretations of user retrieval queries.\n\nFinally, the overall priority of e-commerce web pages is determined through BP neural network. Content priority,\ntime consumption priority, e-commerce users' explicit/implicit feedback on candidate websites, recommendation\nsemantics and input bias amount are the 5 input features of the BP neural network. The neural network randomly\nassigns weights to all input nodes, compares the actual output of the network with a manually set threshold, and\ngenerates the difference between the actual output and the true value. The weight value of the input node is\nadaptively adjusted according to the feedback value of the error tolerance of the output to the input layer until the\ncorrect output is produced. Fine-tuning the weights in this way is important for supervised learning and can\neffectively improve the accuracy of prioritizing web pages related to user searches.\n\nSince this project has 5 feature inputs, the input layer of the neural network consists of five neurons.\nCorrespondingly, the output layer comprises a single neuron, and the output sample is the correlation between the\nweb page represented by the input feature group and the user's preferences, which is the priority of the network.\nFor the hidden layer, if the number of neurons is large, the classification accuracy will be improved to a certain\nextent, but it will also exponentially increase the transfer calculation from the input layer to the hidden layer and\nthe hidden layer to the output layer, making it possible to learn and classify online. The time is too long. If the\nnumber of neurons is small, the network will have poor fault tolerance and more local minima. According to the\nexperience of the existing literature, the optimal value for the number of neurons in the hidden layer is: the number\nof neurons in the input layer * the square root of the number of neurons in the output layer + L (L is an integer\nbetween 0 and 5), which is what this project implies the number of layer neurons can be selected from 3 to 8.\nThrough multiple experimental analyses, this paper selected the number of neurons in the middle layer to be 4\nunder balanced consideration of classification performance and classification speed.\n\nThe BP neural network structure diagram used in this article is shown in Figure 2."}, {"title": "3.3 This article's web page recommendation algorithm", "content": "This section describes the specific algorithm of the e-commerce web page recommendation scheme proposed in\nthis article based on semantic web mining and BP neural network.

The number of books in the database is 5,800, divided into education, humanities and\nsocial sciences, technology, 5 categories including literature and life. Each major category is subdivided into 6\nsubcategories. Taking science and technology as an example, it is divided into subcategories such as popular\nscience, computers, architecture, medicine, agriculture and forestry, and science.

This article uses 2 commonly used performance indicators: precision and recall to evaluate\nweb page recommendations program performance. The accuracy rate refers to the proportion of relevant\ndocuments in the recommendation results, that is, the ratio of recommended products calculated by the\nrecommendation model to all products related to the recommended topic[11], the expression is as follows:\n\n$PRE = \\frac{\u03a3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5 R(u) \u0e01T(u)}{\u03a3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5 R(u)}$ (5)\n\nRecall rate refers to the proportion of relevant documents included in the recommended results to all relevant\ndocuments in the entire collection.

If a user's access sequence is <A, B, C>, it means that the user first\naccesses URLA, then accesses URLB, and finally Visit URLC. The longer the access sequence, the more user\npreference information it contains[13].\n\nAs can be seen from Figures 4 and 5, both the accuracy and recall of website recommendations increase as the\naccess sequence length increases. This is because the access sequence length increases, making the features\nobtained by web data mining more representative of user preferences. However, when the access sequence length\nreaches 6, various performance metrics tend to stabilize. However, the scheme in this paper achieves better\nperformance than that in literature[3]. When the sequence length is 8, the accuracy and recall rate of this scheme\nare 91.7% and 90.3% respectively, which are 6.2% and 4.9% higher than in literature[3] respectively.

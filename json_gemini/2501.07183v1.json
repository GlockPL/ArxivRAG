Given the spatial nature of the data and the high cost of data collection, we evaluated two interpolation approaches: Gaussian processes (GPs) with different kernels and kriging with various variograms. The objectives of this work are threefold: (i) to identify which interpolation methods offer the best predictive performance for various regression algorithms, (ii) to analyze the evolution of performance as a function of the number of observations added, and (iii) to assess the spatial consistency of augmented datasets. The results show that GP-based methods, in particular with combined kernels (GP-COMB), significantly improve the performance of regression algorithms while requiring less additional data. Although kriging shows slightly lower performance, it is distinguished by a more homogeneous spatial coverage, a potential advantage in certain contexts.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the field of data-centric artificial intelligence, data augmentation plays a crucial role in the development of training sets. This process consists in enriching the training set by generating new observations without directly collecting additional data. In the literature, two key terms emerge: Data Augmentation (DA) and Data Generation (DG). These concepts cover several practices, such as the augmentation of observations, the creation of new variables, or the treatment of missing values. In this study, we focus on observation augmentation, or data augmentation, in the context of tabular data. Among existing approaches, rule-based methods extract specific patterns from the data to generate new observations. Variational autoencoders (VAE) combine unsupervised learning and probabilities to generate new data. Other techniques include generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and reinforcement learning. In our case, we address a specific problem linked to data augmentation in a game aimed at predicting the presence of the Commelina benghalensis L. species in sugarcane plots on Reunion Island. Collecting these data is time-consuming and costly, and requires specific expertise to guarantee their quality. These constraints considerably limit the volume of data available, in contrast to contexts where the above-mentioned approaches are commonly used. In addition, our data have a spatial dimension, as each plot is geographically located on the island. To meet these challenges, we are exploring interpolation methods adapted to geo-referenced data, notably kriging and Gaussian processes (GPs). Kriging is a geostatistical method that estimates the values of unsampled points using a variogram to model spatial dependence. This approach is based on the idea that spatially close points have correlated values. Conversely, GPs define a probabilistic distribution over the possible functions, enabling flexible and generalized interpolation. The aim of this study is threefold: (i) to assess whether these approaches can"}, {"title": "Kriging and GPs for interpolation", "content": "Interpolation refers to a model's ability to predict values for data points located between existing observations in the training set. Unlike extrapolation, which concerns predictions outside the range of known data, interpolation focuses on predictions within this range. It plays a crucial role in many algorithms, enabling continuous values of a target variable to be estimated as a function of input variables. For, a training dataset D = {(xi, Yi)|i = 1, 2, . . ., n} and yi = f(xi) a scalar for an unknown function f we wish to interpolate the value y* of a test point x* through f. Kriging and GPs are two variants of the same interpolation method, with kriging being the term traditionally used in geostatistics and GP for machine-learning. Although they refer to the same family of algorithms, there are a few differences, notably in the function used to express the co-variance between the data (one the kernels and the other the variograms) and also in the estimation method used to predict y*.\nKriging Kriging, named after the South African geostatistician Danie Krige, is a geostatistical interpolation method widely used to estimate the values of unsampled points from existing spatial data. It is based on the theory of regionalized variables and uses variograms to model the spatial dependency structure between data points. For a variable of interest at a spatial position x*, the aim of kriging is to predict f(x*) using a linear combination of the observed values y\u017c for points X1,...XN:\n$f(x*) \u2013 \\mu(x*) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\lambda_{i}[Yi \u2013 \\mu(X_{i})]$\nwhere di are the weights assigned to each observation xi, \u03bc(xi) the mean of the observation points so as to minimize the mean-squared prediction error. Several types of kriging exist, depending on what assumptions can be made about the mean \u03bc(x*): simple kriging assumes that the mean is known, ordinary kriging assumes that the mean is unknown and is therefore estimated locally on the basis of the observation points, and co-kriging uses several correlated variables in addition to spatial variables to improve predictions. To calculate the weights Ai, we use a variogram (or semi-variogram) which describes the variation of f(x) as a function of the distance between two points citeoliver2015basic. The variogram is crucial in kriging, as it provides information on the weighting of observations for estimating values at unsampled points:\n$\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\Sigma_{11} & : & \\Sigma_{1N} \\\\\n: & \\ddots & : \\\\\n\\Sigma_{N1} & : & \\Sigma_{NN}\n\\end{array}\n\\right] \\left[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\lambda_{1} \\\\\n: \\\\\n\\lambda_{N}\n\\end{array}\n\\right] = \\left[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Sigma_{x*1} \\\\\n: \\\\\n\\Sigma_{x*N}\n\\end{array}\n\\right]$\nwhere Eij is the covariance between the observed points xi, xj \u2208 X with i, j \u2208 {1, ..., N} and Exi the covariance between the point x* to be interpolated and an observation point xi.\nGaussian Process Regression Gaussian Processes (GP) are non-parametric models defined as a collection of random variables X such that for any finite set of points x1,x2,...,xn, the vector (f(x1), f(x2), ..., f (xn)) follows a multivariate normal distribution. A GP is fully specified by its mean function m(X) = E[f(X)] and its covariance function k(x, x') = Cov(f(x), f(x')). It estimates the value f(x*) such that :\nf(x*) ~ GP(m(x), k(x,x'))\nAs observations are made, this a priori can be sequentially updated to become an a posteriori distribution of the true function representing the target variable of interest. For regression, the GP"}, {"title": "Proposed Method", "content": "Interpolation of geo-referenced data can be seen as data augmentation. Indeed, interpolation algorithms well adapted to a spatial framework seem a particularly suitable solution in this case. These interpolation methods can then be used to increase the number of data items when the latter are limited in number. We chose to use the kriging interpolation and Gaussian process regression presented in the previous section to increase the number of data available in an agricultural database designed to predict the cover of the weed species Commelina benghalensis L. (COMBE) on sugarcane plots in La R\u00e9union. Three questions may then be raised: (i) which interpolation method for increasing the number of data seems the most effective in terms of predictive performance, (ii) at what threshold of added points does predictive performance seem to converge and (iii) how does the distribution of the species (in terms of cover density) evolve for an interpolation method compared to the distribution on the dataset without increase?\nDataset We use a dataset comprising geo-referenced real floristic survey data from La R\u00e9union, concerning the presence of the weed Commelina benghalensis L. on sugarcane plots [Fabre-Ferber et al., 2021, Laine et al., 2024] This dataset faithfully reflects the challenges common in realistic and complex data contexts, characterized by limited observations. The dataset consists of 745 observations and includes 8 variables, both continuous and categorical summarized in the table 1. Variables such as plot location were removed as they were not used for interpolation. For the variable of interest (species cover) is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 representing zero cover on a plot and 100 representing total species cover Commelina benghalensis L..\nInterpolation method In a classic case of interpolation, where we wish to estimate the value of a geo-referenced point x* from observed points, it is defined by its coordinates in a given projection system (in our case, latitude and longitude). These coordinates can be obtained directly from knowledge of the projection system. However, the problem becomes more complex when we wish to integrate other auxiliary variables, such as altitude or rainfall, which cannot be directly deduced from the projection system. A simple approach would be to assign a mean value or a distribution calculated from the observed points. However, these assumptions can introduce significant deviations from reality, compromising the accuracy of the interpolation."}, {"title": "Results and interpretation", "content": "This section presents and analyzes the results of various data augmentations via the interpolation techniques described above. The results in Table 2 present the root mean square errors (RMSE) for various regression algorithms applied to data sets augmented via different interpolation techniques. Figure 1 shows the evolution of performance for a particular algorithm several number of points added by the different interpolations. Finally, figure 3 shows density maps made with the base dataset and the datasets augmented by the different interpolation techniques.\nEvaluation The results show that data augmentation via Gaussian Processes and Kriging systematically improves the performance of regression models compared with Base. Among the techniques tested, GP-COMB emerged as the best-performing method for RF, GB and K-NN, showing that it appears to be effective in generating new data that serves performance well. GP-QUAD stands out for LR and RR, effectively modeling both linear and non-linear relationships, making it particularly well-suited to these models. For kriging interpolation, the Co-K-SPHE and Co-K-EXP variograms produce good results, particularly for MLP and K-NN. However, they show limited compatibility with certain models such as SVR, where performance remains inferior to that of Gaussian processes. The results also reveal that using the dataset without augmentation leads to a noticeable drop in performance, underlining the value of augmentation approaches, particularly in contexts where initial data is limited. In summary, GP-COMB stands out as the most efficient and versatile method, offering significant improvements for many models but particularly for MLP, which on average out of all interpolation methods has the best performance. However, kriging with the variogram set remains an interesting alternative, especially for models like MLP, and may be preferred depending on context and data characteristics. For the remainder of these experiments, we have chosen to retain the MLP algorithm.\nPerformance as a function of the number of points added Analysis of the evolution of MSE as a function of the number of points added revealed distinct behaviors according to the interpolation methods. GP-COMB and GP-LIN stood out for their rapid convergence towards minimum error, reaching a plateau at around 200 points added. This shows that these methods converge faster, so"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we explored various interpolation techniques for the augmentation of geo-referenced data, evaluating their effectiveness through several regression algorithms.

The objectives of this research were (i) to identify the methods offering the best performance on validation, (ii) to analyze the evolution of an algorithm's performance as a function of the number of points added, and (iii) to understand the influence of these approaches on the estimated spatial distribution in relation to the initial dataset. The results indicate that some methods, notably GP-COMB and GP-LIN, stand out by significantly improving the performance of regression algorithms while requiring fewer points to achieve optimal convergence. Kriging methods, although less efficient overall and with slower convergence, offer a more homogeneous spatial coverage of the species. On the other hand, kernel-based approaches tend to produce more generalized models over the whole island, a result that remains to be further investigated to fully assess its implications. These conclusions open up several perspectives. On the one hand, it would be relevant to apply these techniques to other geo-referenced datasets in order to verify their robustness and applicability.

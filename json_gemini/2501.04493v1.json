Despite identifying numerous risk factors influencing its onset, a comprehensive understanding of its genesis and management across diverse populations remains limited. Recent advancements in machine learning have demonstrated the potential for leveraging patient data to enable early congenital heart disease detection. Over the past seven years, researchers have proposed various data-driven and algorithmic solutions to address this challenge. This paper presents a systematic review of congential heart disease recognition using machine learning, conducting a meta-analysis of 432 references from leading journals published between 2018 and 2024. A detailed investigation of 74 scholarly works highlights key factors, including databases, algorithms, applications, and solutions. Additionally, the survey outlines reported datasets used by machine learning experts for congenital heart disease recognition. Using a systematic literature review methodology, this study identifies critical challenges and opportunities in applying machine learning to congenital heart disease.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "CHD is a major birth defect with the highest mortality rate worldwide, with a reported incidence of approximately 1.8 per 100 live births [1, 2]. This disease can be properly cured if early detection and intervention are performed on time [3]. Moreover, a timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial for affected children to receive effective treatment, significantly increasing the likelihood of successful surgical outcomes [4, 5, 6, 7]. Medical practitioners believe that early detection and surgical intervention of CHD in a timely manner lead to an asymptomatic CHD condition, which is a healthy condition [2, 8]. However, due to a complex diagnosis process and the unavailability of pediatric cardiologists in remote areas, a significant number of critical CHDs continue to go undiagnosed [9].\nCHD encompasses cardiac abnormalities and structural alterations of the heart that are present at birth. Each person with CHD has a unique heart, made up of a unique mix of heart problems that were there before surgery and changes that happened due to long-term remodelling [10]. Researchers reported thirty-five different types of CHDs [11]. Nanotologists and medical practitioners have not fully explored all these types. However, most doctors can identify easily four common types: ASD, VSD, PDA, and PFO [12]. Doctors use various modalities such as echo, ECG, US, CT scan, X-rays, and POX to diagnose CHDs. To the best of our understanding, the gold standard for CHD recognition is the echo.\nThe adoption of AI in medical diagnostics is rapidly expanding due to its efficiency, accessibility, and operational improvements [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This growing integration has heightened the demand for AI in clinical settings. Recent developments in AI methodologies have inspired numerous studies on CHD, focusing on accelerating the scanning process, enhancing image quality, and improving diagnostic accuracy [20, 21, 22]. By analyzing large datasets, AI can identify hidden patterns and relationships that might be overlooked by human experts. These insights enable AI models to deliver accurate predictions about the prevalence and severity of CHD. Researchers have also reported software applications that leverage AI for evaluating some ventricular functions through echo modality [23, 24]. Despite these advancements, we are still distant from achieving a stage where AI can entirely substitute or autonomously assist medical professionals in the identification of CHD. AI can serve as a powerful tool to complement clinicians, but achieving reliable, autonomous AI-driven diagnosis requires overcoming significant technical and ethical challenges."}, {"title": "1.1.

Notably, most of the high-quality papers in this field are published in journals dedicated to the medical or cardiovascular fields, highlighting the focused interest of these disciplines in advancing CHD-ML research. The rarity of repeated publications on CHD-ML in the same journal also underscores the uniqueness and diversity of these studies, as well as the broad interest across multiple outlets. We must add, the lack of repeated contributions by the same authors in CHD-related research indicates a significant gap in continuity within this field. This suggests that most researchers do not pursue long-term investigations or build on their previous work, highlighting the need for sustained focus and collaboration to advance CHD studies comprehensively.

This murmurs can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as valve abnormalities, CHDs, or increased blood flow conditions (e.g., during pregnancy or fever). Murmurs are classified as either: Innocent (no underlying heart problem) and Abnormal (associated with structural heart issues). PCG is a tool used to record and analyze the sounds of the heart, including murmurs. A PCG device captures the heart's acoustic signals (such as normal heart sounds, S1 and S2 and ABNOR sounds such as gallops) and visualizes them in a graphical waveform.

Real-Synethetic-CHDs", "content": "The dataset proposed in [80] consists of 6400 long-axis MRI frames. All the patients had CHDs, particularly those with post-repair ToF, a common condition that causes the heart to turn blue. Fourteen centers in Germany participated in a state study that included MRIs. Patients over 8 years old who did not have implantable cardioverter-defibrillators met the inclusion criteria. The MRIs were saved in DICOM format and had information like the weight, height, and age. Data were made anonymous and were allowed to be used in a study in an ethical way.\nProgressive GANs were also used to make synthetic MRI images. The images made by Progressive GANs were 256 x 256 pixels and showed both short- and long-axis views. These synthetic images were used to build a U-Net segmentation model to separate the left ventricle, the right ventricle, and the right atrium. This dataset demonstrates the use of GAN-generated data to enhance rare medical datasets and enhance AI training for CHD diagnosis."}, {"title": "4.6. Electrocardiogram", "content": "We believe that after echo, ECG is the second authentic signal for CHD diagnosis. Similar to echo, ECG diagnosis necessitates expert knowledge. The ECG identifies irregularities in cardiac rhythm and evaluates the occurrence of prior myocardial infarctions, ischemia, and other conditions that may precipitate heart failure. Due to its inherent safety and cost-effectiveness, ECG is a widely adapted tool for CHD diagnosis [4"}]}

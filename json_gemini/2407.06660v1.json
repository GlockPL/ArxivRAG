{"title": "Collaborative Design of Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Learning Activities", "authors": ["Margarida Romero"], "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has accelerated innovations in different aspects of citizens' lives. Many contexts\nhave already addressed technology-enhanced learning, but educators at different educational levels now\nneed to develop Al literacy and the ability to integrate appropriate AI usage into their teaching. We take\ninto account this objective, along with the creative learning design, to create a formative intervention that\nenables preservice teachers, in-service teachers, and EdTech specialists to effectively incorporate AI into\ntheir teaching practices. We developed the formative intervention with Terra Numerica and Maison de\nl'Intelligence Artificielle in two phases in order to enhance their understanding of AI and foster its\ncreative application in learning design. Participants reflect on Al's potential in teaching and learning by\nexploring different activities that can integrate AI literacy in education, including its ethical\nconsiderations and potential for innovative pedagogy. The approach emphasises not only acculturating\nprofessionals to Al but also empowering them to collaboratively design AI-enhanced educational\nactivities that promote learner engagement and personalised learning experiences. Through this process,\nparticipants in the workshops develop the skills and mindset necessary to effectively leverage AI while\nmaintaining a critical awareness of its implications in education.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has stirred widespread interest, particularly in\ngenerative Al technologies (Chiu, 2024; Nguyen et al., 2024), not only from a professional perspective,\nviewing it as the Fourth Education Revolution (Seldon et al., 2020) but also raising different types of\nexpectations from educators and learners related to the potential of AI to transform educational practices\nthrough adaptability (Gligorea et al., 2023), creative pedagogies (Romero et al., 2023), and unethical\nways (Van Wyk, 2024).\nEducation should address the dual nature of AI technologies. While AI offers unprecedented opportunities\nfor transformative and civic engagement through enhanced collaboration, critical and computational\nthinking, creativity, and problem solving (J\u00e4rvela et al., 2023; Romero et al., 2023; Urmeneta & Romero,\n2024), it also presents significant ethical and equity challenges. These challenges include the potential for\ncitizen passivity and alienation as AI applications mystify and automate activities that traditionally benefit\nfrom human judgement and ethical considerations. Such a paradox underscores the importance of\nacculturating educators and learners to AI, ensuring they possess both the literacy and ethical frameworks\nneeded to leverage Al positively while guarding against its less beneficial impacts. This balanced\napproach is crucial to realising Al's potential in education without compromising the human elements that\nare essential to learning and development."}, {"title": "Learning design support for creative pedagogy supported by AI", "content": "In this study, we develop a critical reflection on the activities developed at Terra Numerica and Maison de\nl'Intelligence Artificielle (MIA) and the working group Scol_IA (Romero et al., 2023; Urmeneta &\nRomero, 2024). The formative intervention aims to support educators in their acculturation of AI and the\ncreative integration of AI in their educational practices. We explore how AI supports educators in\ndeveloping creative pedagogical approaches through a half-day workshop hosted at MIA. The workshop\nis designed to provide hands-on learning experiences and collaborative design opportunities for in-service\nteachers and students of the MSc Smart EdTech programme at Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur.\nDuring the initial exploration phase of the workshop, participants engage in interactive activities that\nshowcase various applications of generative and non-generative AI technologies relevant to education.\nThese activities include demonstrations of AI-driven tools for content creation, adaptive learning systems,\nand intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). These activities include image generation, face and object\ncorrection, and social robotics based on AI. Through these experiences, educators gain insights into AI's\npotential and develop their Al literacy.\nFollowing the exploration phase, participants transition into a team-based design exercise where they\napply their understanding of AI to develop innovative pedagogical activities using the #PPAI6 model\nframework. This model encourages educators to leverage AI for creative purposes in education, such as\nfostering critical thinking, promoting personalised learning pathways, or facilitating collaborative\nprojects. By providing practical guidance and collaborative opportunities, this workshop bridges the gap\nbetween AI technology and effective educational practice. The results of our research provide valuable\ninsights and resources to support the ongoing integration of AI in education, facilitating continuous\nimprovement and adaptation in pedagogical approaches."}, {"title": "Human-AI collaboration in education through a creative pedagogy perspective", "content": "With the increasing prevalence and accessibility of AI systems, the dynamics between humans and AI\nhave progressed from mere process automation to a collaborative partnership founded on mutual\nsynergies and strengths (Razmerita et al., 2022), as well as the metacognitive potential inherent in\nhuman-AI collaboration (Romero et al., 2023). It is within this intersection of human intuition and\nimagination, coupled with Al's computational power and processing capabilities, that the greatest\npotential for human-AI co-creativity emerges. This potential is already evident across various creative\ndomains, such as music composition and performance (Rohrmeier, 2022), as well as in the visual arts,\nwhere artists have utilized AI tools to enrich their creative processes (Kim et al., 2021), leveraging an\nextensive learning approach aimed at transformative objectives (Romero et al., 2023). However, for our\nfocus, it is the prospect of reimagining creativity through the prism of human-AI interactions, innovative\nteaching strategies, and learner-centric activities that may enable us to nurture learners' agency and foster\na creative pedagogy supported by human-AI collaborations. To facilitate the identification of the different\nlevels of creative engagement in the use of AI, the Passive-Participatory (PP) model for AI in education\n(#PPai6) distinguishes six levels of creative engagement (Figure 3).\nAt the first level, learners act as passive consumers, engaging with AI-generated content without a full\nunderstanding of its workings. Moving through the levels, learners progress to become interactive\nconsumers, actively interacting with AI-generated content as the AI system adapts to their actions. Levels\nthree and four involve individual and collaborative content creation, respectively, with learners utilising\nAI tools to generate new content. The fifth level, participatory knowledge co-creation, sees teams creating\ncontent with the aid of AI tools and collaboration from stakeholders to tackle complex problems. At the\nsixth and most advanced level, expansive learning supported by AI, participants' agency expands or\ntransforms problematic situations through formative interventions. Al tools play a crucial role in\nidentifying contradictions in complex problems, generating concepts or artefacts to regulate conflicting\nstimuli, and fostering collective agency and action. While the potential for AI to reach this transformative\nlevel is immense, it is noteworthy that the majority of current AI in education studies operate at the\nsecond level (interactive consumer), primarily relying on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The\nexploration of higher levels presents an exciting frontier for the future development and implementation\nof AI in education that will be explored through the different case studies of this book.\nTo facilitate the design, we propose that pre-service teachers and edtech professionals develop their\nco-design learning activity using a template. The template provides a structured approach for designing\nlearning activities that effectively integrate AI into education as a support for the learners activities or as a\nway to develop their learners' AI literacy (Alexandre et al., 2020). The formative intervention follows a\nstep-by-step process for defining the learning objectives, targeting specific learner groups, and outlining\nthe entire process from conception to evaluation."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Education is undergoing a profound transformation as we embrace the potential of AI to enhance creative\npedagogies, as evidenced by our recent workshop at Maison de l'Intelligence Artificielle (MIA). Our\nworkshop highlighted that education extends beyond the transmission of knowledge; it aims to cultivate\ncreative thinking, critical skills, and a lifelong love of learning. Human-AI collaborations that support and\naugment learners and educators activities require the development of Al literacy and supporting the\ncomplexity of learning design activities (Duret & Romero, 2022) through visualisation tools such as the\nco-design template proposed for this formative intervention. This transformative approach presents an\nopportunity to redefine creative pedagogies by integrating AI into educational practices across different\nlevels and domains, thus opening up new avenues for personalised, engaging, and transformative learning\nexperiences. By adopting an expansive learning approach (Engestr\u00f6m & Sannino, 2010; Romero,\nDuguay, et al., 2023), we can develop educators' agencies to identify and integrate Al's capabilities to\naugment teaching and learning activities while supporting the development of AI literacy for everyone."}]}

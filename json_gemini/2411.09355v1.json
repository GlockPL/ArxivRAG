[{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "authors": ["Ermis Soumalias", "Jakob Heiss", "Jakob Weissteiner", "Sven Seuken"], "abstract": "We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, several papers have recently proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information from bidders to maximize efficiency. The SOTA ML-based algorithms elicit bidders' preferences via value queries (i.e., \u201cWhat is your value for the bundle {A, B}?", "At prices p, what is your most preferred bundle of items?\"). In this paper, we examine the advantages of value and demand queries from both an auction design and an ML perspective. We propose a novel ML algorithm that provably integrates the full information from both query types. As suggested by our theoretical analysis, our experimental results verify that combining demand and value queries results in significantly better learning performance. Building on these insights, we present MLHCA, the most efficient ICA ever designed. MLHCA substantially outperforms the previous SOTA in realistic auction settings, delivering large efficiency gains. Compared to the previous SOTA, MLHCA reduces efficiency loss by up to a factor of 10, and in the most challenging and realistic domain, MLHCA outperforms the previous SOTA using 30% fewer queries. Thus, MLHCA achieves efficiency improvements that translate to welfare gains of hundreds of millions of USD, while also reducing the cognitive load on the bidders, establishing a new benchmark both for practicability and for economic impact.": "sections", "content": "Combinatorial auctions (CAs) are used to allocate multiple items among several bidders who may view those items as complements or substitutes. In a CA, bidders are can submit bids for whole bundles/packages of items. CAs have enjoyed widespread adoption in practice, with their applications ranging from allocating spectrum licences to TV ad slots and airport landing/take-off slots.\nThe key challenge in CAs is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items, making it impossible for bidders to report their full value function in all but the smallest domains. Moreover, Nisan & Segal (2006) showed that for arbitrary value functions, CAs require an exponential number of bids in order to guarantee full efficiency. Thus, practical CA mechanisms cannot provide efficiency guarantees in real world settings with more than a modest number of items. Instead, the focus has shifted towards iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs), where bidders interact with the auctioneer over a series of rounds, providing only a limited (i.e., practically feasible) amount of information, with the aim to maximize the efficiency of the final allocation."}, {"title": "1.1 ML-POWERED ITERATIVE COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS", "content": "To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various ways of using machine learning (ML) to improve the efficiency of ICAs. The seminal works by Blum et al. (2004) and Lahaie & Parkes (2004) were the first to frame preference elicitation in CAs as a learning problem. In more recent years, proposed ML-powered ICAs. At the heart of those approaches lies an ML-powered preference elicitation algorithm that uses an ML model to learn each bidder's value function to generate an informative value query (i.e., \u201cWhat is your value for the bundle {A, B}?\u201d), which in turn refines that bidder's ML model.\nWhile those value-query based ML-powered ICAs lead to significant efficiency gains redefining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) efficiency results in many realistic auction domains, those approaches suffer from one common practical limitation: they fundamentally rely throughout the whole ICA on value queries (VQs). Prior research in auction design has identified demand queries (DQs) as the best way to run an auction. Their advantages compared to value queries include elimination of tacit collusion and bid signaling, as well as simplified bidder decision-making that keeps the bidders focused on what is most relevant: the relationship between prices and aggregate demand. Additionally, value queries are cognitively complex, and thus typically should be only used sparsely in real-world ICAs. For these reasons, DQs are the most prominent interaction paradigm for auctions in practice. Following this rationale, addressed the common limitation of prior work by designing the first practical ML-powered ICA that elicits information from bidders via DQs instead of VQs and only makes use of VQs in supplementary rounds, when bidders have already obtained a clearer picture on which bundles they can realistically hope to clinch and how much they should approximately value such bundles.\nWhile this DQ-based ICA represented a significant leap towards making ML-powered ICAs practical and at the same time outperformed the baseline CCA that is typically used in real-world applications, it still suffered from the following two important deficiencies: First, it could not reach the SOTA efficiency of the impractical VQ-based ML-powered ICAs. Second, to improve efficiency, just like the CCA, it required the use of a supplementary round, in which the bidders must decide on which additional value bids to submit to the mechanism, a cognitive complicated task for the bidders.\nThe present paper closes these two last gaps in the realm of ICAs by designing a hybrid ML-powered ICA that combines DQ-based rounds with a sophisticated yet practical VQ-based supplementary round. Importantly, this hybrid ML-powered ICA clearly outperforms the previous SOTA ICA while still being practical in real-world applications."}, {"title": "1.2 OUR CONTRIBUTIONS", "content": "In this paper, we introduce the Machine Learning-powered Hybrid Combinatorial Auction (ML-HCA), a practical ICA that achieves unprecedented efficiency.

In Section 4, we introduce a learning algorithm capable of leveraging both types of queries. We provide strong experimental evidence of the learning benefits of combining both query types, as well as the advantages of starting an auction with DQs instead of VQs.\n3.

In contrast to this prior work, our design incorporates an ML algorithm into the mechanism itself, i.e., the ML algorithm is part of the mechanism. Lahaie & Lubin (2019) suggest an adaptive price update rule that increases price expressivity as the rounds progress in order to improve efficiency and speed of convergence. Unlike that work, we aim to improve preference elicitation in the main rounds while still using linear prices. Preference elicitation is a key market design challenge outside of CAs too. introduce an ML-powered mechanism for course allocation that improves preference elicitation by asking students comparison queries.\nDespite the prominence of DQs in real-world applications, the only prior work apart from on ML-based DQs that we are aware of is that of who proposed integrating ML in a price-based ICA to generate the next price vector in order to achieve faster convergence. However, this prior work does not exploit any notion of similarity between bundles that contain overlapping items, only incorporates a fraction of the information revealed by the agents' bidding (i.e., for the bundle an agent bids on, her value for that bundle must be larger than its price), and is computationally intractable already in medium-sized auction domains."}, {"title": "1.4 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND INCENTIVES", "content": "MLHCA integrates both ML-powered DQ and VQ rounds.

Brero et al. (2021) argued that MLCA offers strong practical incentives, and under two additional assumptions, truthful bidding is an ex-post Nash equilibrium. In Appendix A.4 we provide a detailed discussion of these arguments, and detail why they also apply to MLHCA's VQ rounds.\nBy effectively combining activity rules in the DQ rounds and leveraging the established incentive structure of MLCA in the VQ rounds, MLHCA achieves a robust incentive alignment across all its stages."}, {"title": "2 PRELIMINARIES", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 FORMAL MODEL FOR ICAS", "content": "We consider multiset CA domains with a set $\\mathcal{N} = \\{1, ..., n\\}$ of bidders and a set $\\mathcal{M} = \\{1, ...,m\\}$ of distinct items with corresponding capacities, i.e., number of available copies, $c = (c_1, ..., c_m) \\in \\mathbb{N}^m$.

The CCA consists of two phases. The initial clock phase proceeds in rounds. In each round r, the auctioneer sets anonymous item prices $p^r\\in \\mathbb{R}_+^m$, prompting each bidder to respond to a DQ, declaring her utility-maximizing bundle at $p^r$. In the next round, the prices of over-demanded items are increased by a fixed percentage, until over-demand is eliminated. The second phase of the CCA, known as the supplementary round, allows bidders to report their valuations for additional bundles, governed by specific activity rules to promote incentive alignment. The clock bids raised heuristic suggests that bidders report their values for all bundles they requested during the clock phase. The final allocation is determined by solving the WDP based on all reports from both phases, as in Equation (3).\nML-CCA The most efficient DQ-based ICA is the Machine Learning-powered Combinatorial Clock Auction (ML-CCA). ML-CCA has the same interaction paradigm as the CCA, but with a substantially more refined DQ-generation algorithm in its clock phase. In each round, an ML model is trained to estimate each bidder's value function based on previously submitted DQ responses. The auctioneer then solves a convex optimization problem to determine the prices with the greatest clearing potential for those value function estimates.\nBOCA The SOTA ICA in terms of efficiency is the VQ-based Bayesian optimization-based combinatorial auction (BOCA). The main idea of BOCA is that in each round, the auctioneer creates an estimate of the upper uncertainty bound of the value function of each agent based on her past responses. Then, the auctioneer solves an ML-based WDP to find the feasible allocation with the highest upper bound on its estimated social welfare, and queries each agent her value for her bundle in that allocation. This allows the mechanism to balance between exploring and exploiting the bundle space during its preference elicitation phase."}, {"title": "2.3 ML FRAMEWORK", "content": "The ML models used by ML-CCA, and as basis for the construction of the uncertainty bound estimates in BOCA are monotone-value neural networks (MVNNs) $M_i : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ (Weissteiner et al., 2022a). MVNNs are a recently introduced class of NNs specifically designed to represent monotone combinatorial valuations. MVNNs have also had success in combinatorial allocation domains without money, e.g. for course allocation Soumalias et al. (2024a). Soumalias et al. (2024b) introduced multiset MVNNs (mMVNNs), an extension of MVNNs that also incorporates at a structural level the information that some items in the auction are identical copies of each other. In this work, we instantiate our ML models using mMVNNs, and denote agent $i$'s model as $M_i : \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Within this work, we will refer to all mMVNNs simply as MVNNs."}, {"title": "3 ADVANTAGES OF DQS AND VQS AND WHY ONE SHOULD COMBINE THEM", "content": "In this section, we examine the limitations of using only VQs or only DQs in auctions and highlight the benefits of combining them.\n3.1 DISADVANTAGES OF ONLY USING VQS\nAlmost all ML-powered VQ-based auctions including the current SOTA, BOCA (Weissteiner et al., 2023) first ask each bidder multiple random VQs (i.e., VQs for randomly selected bundles). These VQs are necessary to initialize the ML estimates of the bidder's value functions. In practice, it is very hard for bidders to answer random VQs since they are not aligned with their preferences. The most popular ICAs in practice (e.g., the CCA) ask the bidders DQs, which have been argued can be answered by the bidders sufficiently well.\nEven if bidders manage to respond perfectly to random VQs, the information obtained is limited. This is because, in large combinatorial domains, bidders typically have high values for only a small subset of possible bundles, making the probability of querying one of these high-value bundles at random exceedingly low. On the other hand, querying bidders with DQs at a random price vector is more likely to prompt responses that reveal their high-value bundles. Formally:"}, {"title": "Lemma 1.", "content": "The difference in expected social welfare between an auction that uses a single random demand query and an auction that uses $k < 2^m$ random value queries can be arbitrarily large."}, {"title": "Remark 1.", "content": "This limitation of random VQs is evidenced in practice. Empirical comparisons between VQ-based ML-powered mechanisms, such as Weissteiner et al. (2023), and DQ-based mechanisms, such as Soumalias et al. (2024b), reveal that efficiency after initial queries is significantly lower for VQ-based approaches across all tested domains (see Figure 4 in Section 6).\nBeyond auction efficiency, the limited information provided by random VQs poses challenges for learning algorithms in ML-powered ICAS. In contrast, DQs provide global information about bidder preferences across the entire bundle space. When bidder $i$ responds to a DQ at prices $p$, she solves the optimization problem: $x_i(p) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_i(x) - (p, x)\\}$, which reveals valuable information about her preferences across all possible bundles. Strong evidence for this is presented inSection 4.2, where we show that the network trained only on DQs exhibits better generalization performance than one trained on random VQs.\nAdditionally, if DQ prices are sufficiently low, bidders respond with their value-maximizing bundles, which may be hard to recover through VQs alone. By incorporating this information, the learning algorithm can more effectively identify critical regions in the allocation space and subsequently focus on refining those areas. This advantage is further supported by our experiments (Figure 4 in Section 6). We show that in our ML-powered hybrid auction, the first ML-powered VQ after a series of DQs achieves significantly higher efficiency compared to the first ML-powered VQ after an equivalent number of random VQs in the current SOTA VQ-based auction.\nMoreover, even if the auction finds an efficient allocation by using VQs, it cannot terminate early as there is no way for the auctioneer to certify that the auction has reached 100% efficiency. In contrast, for DQ-based auctions there is an easy condition that allows the auction to terminate early:"}, {"title": "Proposition 1.", "content": "If clearing prices exist, an auction using DQs can provide a guarantee of optimal efficiency and terminate early."}, {"title": "Proof.", "content": "If clearing prices have been found, the corresponding allocation constitutes a Walrasian equilibrium, and thus has an efficiency equal to 100%.

A single DQ can cause an efficiency drop arbitrarily close to 100%. By comparison, in a VQ-based ICA, adding additional queries can never reduce efficiency (assuming truthful bidding)."}, {"title": "Proof.", "content": "Let $m = 2, n = 2, c_1 = 1, c_2 = 1$,\n$v_1 = \\max \\{400 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{x_1 \\geq 1}, 2\\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{x_2 \\geq 1}\\}$ and\n$v_2 = 1\\cdot1\\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{x_1 \\geq 1}$.\nSuppose the auction has asked two DQs. The first DQ $p = (1, 1)$ is responded by both bidders with $(1, 0) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_i(x) - (p, x)\\}$. The second DQ $p = (1.2, 1)$ is responded by bidder 1 with $(1, 0) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_1(x) - (p, x)\\}$ and by bidder 2 with $(0, 0) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_2(x) - (p, x)\\}$.\nAfter these 2 DQs the WDP based on the inferred values (see Equation (3)), would assign item 1 to bidder 1 (resulting in an inferred social welfare of 1.2 + 0 = 1.2). This is the efficient allocation with a true SCW of 400, i.e., an efficiency equal to 100%.\nNow suppose that a third DQ $p = (401, 1)$ is added to the auction. Bidder 1's demand response is $(0, 1) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_1(x) - (p, x)\\}$ and bidder 2's response is $(0, 0) \\in arg \\max_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}} \\{v_2(x) - (p, x)\\}$. The WDP would now assign item 2 to bidder 1 and item 1 to bidder 2, resulting in an inferred SCW of 1+1 = 2). This would result only in an efficiency of $2 / 400 = 1 / 200 < 1\\%$.\nWhile the inferred SCW obviously cannot decrease in any round (since the set we maximize over cannot decrease in any round and inferred values cannot decrease), we have shown here that the true SCW can decrease substantially. In this example, the SCW dropped by more than 99%. One could easily modify this example to even obtain an efficiency drop arbitrarily close to 100% if one decreases the values 1, 1.2 and 2 (the prices and the values inside the value functions) by any small factor or increases the numbers 400 and 401, by any large factor. Then the proof would still work, which shows that the efficiency can even fall from 100% to values arbitrarily close to 0%.\nOn the other hand, if we only ask VQs, there is no difference between inferred SCW and true SCW (assuming truthful bidding), which results in non-decreasing SCW."}, {"title": "Remark 3.", "content": "This is a significant issue in practice. In Section 6 we experimentally show that in the most realistic spectrum auction domain, the CCA's efficiency drops by over 7% with the introduction of more DQs. In a second realistic domain, the CCA actually has higher efficiency after just 5 DQs compared to after 100. This efficiency degradation is not only a concern for the CCA but also affects ML-powered DQ-based ICAs in similar ways.\nIn the next lemma, we show that the same issue arises in an auction that uses both DQs and VQs:"}, {"title": "Lemma 3.", "content": "In an auction that first uses DQs and then VQs, adding VQs can actually reduce efficiency. The efficiency drop can even be arbitrarily close to 100%."}, {"title": "Proof.", "content": "Consider the setting from the proof of Lemma 2 including the first 2 DQs. Recall that in this setting after these 2 DQs, the WDP would achieve 100% efficiency. Now instead of the third DQ, we ask the following VQ: We ask bidder 1 for her value of the bundle (0, 1) and we ask bidder 2 for her value of the bundle (1, 0). Then the WDP based on these 3 rounds would assign item 2 to bidder 1, and item 1 to bidder 2, as we explain in the following. The inferred SCW $\\hat{v}_1(0, 1) + \\hat{v}_2(1, 0) = 2 + 1.1$ (which is equal to the true SCW of this allocation) is higher than the inferred SCW of all other allocations consisting of elicited bundles: For bidder 1 the DQ responses were always (1, 0) with inferred value 1.2, and the VQ elicited $v_1(0, 1) = 2$. For bidder 2, the DQ responses were (1, 0) with inferred value 1 and (0, 0) with inferred value 0, and the VQ response was $v_2(1, 0) = 1.1$. So we see that the highest inferred SCW among all feasible allocations is achieved by assigning item 2 to bidder 1 and item 1 to bidder 2 (e.g., assigning it the other way around would only achieve an inferred SCW of 1.2 + 0, while the true SCW $v_1(1, 0) + v_2(0, 1) = 400 + 0$ would be much larger).\nSo the efficiency dropped from 100% to $\\frac{2+1.1}{400} < 1\\%$ after the VQ (i.e., the efficiency drops by more than 99%)."}, {"title": null, "content": "Even though Lemma 3 shows that an auction using DQs followed by VQs can still experience an arbitrarily large efficiency drop, we can completely address this issue using a single carefully designed VQ, which we call the \"bridge bid.\""}, {"title": "Definition 4 (Bridge bid).", "content": "The bridge bid asks each bidder her value for the bundle she would have been allocated according to the WDP after the last DQ."}, {"title": "Lemma 4.", "content": "In an ICA that first asks DQs and then VQs, by first using a single specific VQ, the bridge bid from Definition 4, the auction can ensure its efficiency is at least as high as the efficiency achieved by its DQs alone."}, {"title": "Proof.", "content": "The bridge bid itself can obviously not decrease efficiency, because it simply replaces the inferred SCW of the winning allocation of the previous WDP with the true SCW of exactly the same allocation. In other words, the inferred values of the bundles of the previously WDP-winning allocation can be increased or stay the same, while all the other inferred values stay the same. Thus the winning allocation stays the winning allocation when the bridge bid is added. For the remainder of the proof, we will show that all the VQs after the bridge bid can also not decrease the efficiency. In every further WDP another allocation can only outperform the bridge bid allocation if it has a higher inferred social welfare. However, if it has a higher inferred SCW, its true SCW cannot be lower than the one of the bridge bid. And as we have shown in the beginning of the proof, the SCW of the allocation of the bridge bid is equal to the SCW of the last WDP winner after the last DQ. Thus, for any VQ after the bridge bid the SCW cannot be worse than the winning allocation of the WDP right after the last DQ."}, {"title": "Remark 4.", "content": "Again, this in practice is highly impactful.

Raising the bids for those bundles would also not help, because this would still not give us any value for 9 items for bidder 2. The best SCW that such WDPs based on DQ responses (and raised DQ responses) can achieve is thus 100, which results in an efficiency of $\\frac{100}{184.\\bar{6}} \\approx 54.28\\%$.\nThus, every method that only asks DQs (e.g., CCA or ) will result in inefficient allocations even in the limit of infinitely many iterations in the case of certain value functions (even if raised clock bids are added in the supplementary round)."}, {"title": "Remark 5.", "content": "The issue highlighted in Theorem 1 also arises in practical settings.

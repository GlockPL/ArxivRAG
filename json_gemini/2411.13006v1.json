Introduction", "content": "In modern healthcare, diagnostic imaging plays a pivotal role in identifying, diagnosing, and monitoring a wide array of conditions. Ultrasound imaging is one of the most common diagnostic methods used across nearly every medical department today. Its popularity stems from its real-time imaging capability, non-invasive nature, and easy accessibility in many clinics. This imaging technique helps in examining the internal anatomy of patients, making it valuable for assessing, managing, and, most importantly, diagnosing various diseases, especially in obstetric, cardiovascular, and liver conditions.\nThe reliance on screens for immediate feedback allows clinicians to make quick decisions regarding both minor and major procedures. However, these advantages are not always apparent with traditional ultrasound systems, which can still be challenging for sonologists. Image interpretation relies on human skill, which can vary significantly, potentially affecting the consistency and accuracy of diagnoses. Additionally, excessive manual control and analysis can lead to physician burnout, particularly during lengthy or complex procedures. Manual adjustments and repetitive tasks during ultrasound procedures may also potentially impact diagnostic consistency and can lead to delayed decision-making. These concerns highlight the urgent need for ultrasound systems that can reduce the burden of manual tasks, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and ensure a smooth workflow.\nThis project aims to address some of these issues by designing a modern ultrasound machine integrated with AI technology, featuring numerous automations to simplify the diagnostic process. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, the proposed system automates essential aspects of ultrasound imaging, including organ detection, segmentation, and liver histopathological analysis, while also offering hands-free operational control through voice commands. The objectives of the project are:\n\u2022 Automated Control of Ultrasound Devices Using Voice Commands: This system utilizes a speech recognition module that allows sonologists to perform hands-free functions such as freezing, zooming, or highlighting the liver. By minimizing physical contact with the ultrasound device, caregivers can focus more on patient interaction, ensuring an uninterrupted workflow.\n\u2022 Organ Detection and Labeling with AI and Curvature Correction: The system employs deep learning via the Mask R-CNN model from Detectron2 to detect and annotate important body organs, such as the liver and kidneys. It accurately accommodates the shape of each organ, enabling precise marking of regions. This capability enhances recognition and segmentation accuracy, reducing the need for manual adjustments while increasing the reliability and efficiency of the diagnostic process.\n\u2022 Liver Histopathology Analysis: The system includes specialized modules for evaluating liver histopathology, specifically aimed at detecting liver fibrosis and other pathological changes. After training, these modules demonstrated outstanding performance, thus allowing physicians to timely and accurately identify liver lesions.\nBy integrating voice control features, automated organ segmentation, and liver histopathology analysis, this system presents a ground breaking ultrasound imaging solution.

Specifically, the Mask R-CNN model from the Detectron2 library was chosen due to its advantages in modeling the complex boundaries of anatomical features that are important for imaging organs. Mask R-CNN is particularly useful for object detection and segmentation in real time, making it suitable for identifying specific organs, such as the liver and kidneys, in ultrasound scans.\nFor training the AI model, only ultrasound imaging data collected from Ramachandra hospital was used. The dataset was prepared using Roboflow, where the representative structures of the organs in the images were marked and labeled. This annotation process enables the model to accurately identify and segment these structures during operation.\nIn addition to manual annotation, data augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the diversity and robustness of the dataset. Moreover, a COCO dataset was downloaded, which included images along with their relevant annotation JSON files. This dataset was instrumental in training the model for segmentation predictions in ultrasound images.\nAs this processing occurs, the unit continuously receives a live ultrasound feed, which it processes in real time, allowing it to detect and delineate structures as they enter the frame. The resulting images from the model provide contour segmentation maps of the identified organs, with each organ clearly masked.\nAdditionally, the model offers a segmentation accuracy score for each detection, indicating the confidence level in the correctness of the segmentation.

This model was also trained with custom weights tailored for histopathology classification, allowing for accurate identification.\nNext, Open CV was utilized for capturing and rendering live video frames onto the system while synchronizing with medical imaging equipment, such as ultrasound scanners. Additionally, a buffering technique was implemented to account for the persistence of vision in video playback, ensuring smooth command execution.\nThreading was used to allow commands to be processed without interfering with video playback. To enhance user interaction, voice input was incorporated using the Speech Recognition library. Commands such as \"FREEZE,\" \"CONTINUE,\" and \"PREDICT\" were enabled, allowing the sonologist to interact with the system while keeping their hands free. A queue system was implemented to optimize command input, preventing chaos from arising in the event of a high demand for commands.\nThe system underwent extensive testing to evaluate its performance. Each module\u2014including model inference, voice command recognition, and video processing\u2014was tested independently to ensure proper functionality. The inter-dependencies of the modules were also tested through direct application scenarios; for instance, when video playback needed to be paused while predictions were made on the frozen image frame. Overall, performance testing confirmed that the system can process live ultrasound feeds with minimal delays while maintaining accurate predictions."}, {"title": "4.2 User Interface Design", "content": "The user interface was crafted in line with the sonologist's workflow in mind, which is aimed at both performance and ease of use.

Masks are used to confine the visible imprints to include those identifiable organs along with their distant confidence and labels for easy orientation.\nThis system offers voice command recognition; hence, users do not have to worry about inputting commands manually but rather can speak commands like \"freeze,\" \"predict,\" and so on. System feedback is given in the form of predicted outputs and also displayed in the runtime thread, such as system state \"paused.\" This allows the user to know what the system is doing at any given moment.

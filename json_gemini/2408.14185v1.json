The content may be updated or\nrevised in future versions. Real-time dynamic path planning in\ncomplex traffic environments presents significant challenges, such\nas varying traffic volumes and traffic signal wait times. While tra-\nditional static routing algorithms like Dijkstra and A* have been\nsuccessful in computing the shortest paths, they often fail to ef-\nfectively address the dynamic nature of traffic conditions. Recent\nReinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have made some progress\nin dynamic navigation; however, most existing models focus solely\non local optima, neglecting global optimality and risking dead-ends\nor network boundary issues in practical applications. This paper\nproposes a novel approach based on causal inference, aimed at\nachieving real-time dynamic path planning for multiple vehicles in\nreal-world road networks, balancing both global and local optimal-\nity. We first utilize the static Dijkstra algorithm to compute a glob-\nally optimal path as a baseline. Then, a distributed control strategy\ndirects vehicles along the baseline path. Upon reaching intersec-\ntions, DynamicRouteGPT performs real-time decision-making for\nlocal path selection, considering real-time traffic information, driv-\ning preferences, and unexpected events to optimize dynamic path\nchoices at each intersection.The DynamicRouteGPT framework\nintegrates multiple techniques, including Markov chains, Bayesian\ninference, and modern large-scale pretrained language models such\nas Llama3 8B, to provide an efficient and reliable path planning\nsolution. This framework not only processes real-time traffic data\nbut also dynamically adjusts path planning to accommodate vari-\nous traffic scenarios and driver preferences. A key innovation of\nour method lies in constructing causal graphs for counterfactual\nreasoning, optimizing path decisions. Our model requires no pre-\ntraining, boasts broad applicability, and can handle various types of\nroad networks. Experimental results demonstrate that this method\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in real-time dynamic\npath planning for multiple vehicles while offering explainability\nin path selection. This approach not only effectively selects the\noptimal path but also provides justifications for the choices made,\noffering a novel and efficient solution for dynamic navigation in\ncomplex traffic environments.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Real-time multi-vehicle dynamic path planning in modern intel-\nligent transportation systems presents a highly challenging prob-\nlem. As urban road networks continue to expand and traffic flows\nbecome increasingly complex, traditional path planning methods\noften struggle to perform effectively in dynamic environments[28].\nSpecifically, fluctuations in traffic volume, periodic changes in traf-\nfic signals, and frequent traffic incidents necessitate a path planning\nsystem with high adaptability and responsiveness. Furthermore,\nthe variability in road conditions, such as traffic congestion, road\ndamage, and adverse weather, places additional demands on the\nreal-time nature of path planning[27, 35]. Path selection for multiple\nvehicles not only needs to consider the optimal route for individual\nvehicles but also must coordinate their interactions to avoid traffic\njams or potential accidents. This coordination between global and\nlocal optimization is one of the key challenges in achieving effective\npath planning.\nWith advancements in autonomous driving technology, issues re-\nlated to vehicle trajectory control and navigation have gained in-\ncreasing attention. However, existing approaches still face several\nlimitations in practical applications. Classical path planning algo-\nrithms, such as Dijkstra and A* [15], are effective at calculating\nthe shortest path under static conditions but are significantly con-\nstrained in dynamic environments due to their inability to adapt to\nreal-time changes in road conditions.

For simulation\npurposes, we employ SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)[19],\nwhere the road network in SUMO is represented as a directed graph.\nIn SUMO, nodes typically represent intersections, while edges repre-\nsent roads or streets, which are unidirectional. Specifically, a SUMO\nnetwork includes the following information: each edge consists of a\ncollection of lanes, with each lane having an ID, location, shape, and\nspeed limit. Intersections are equipped with traffic signal logic, and\njunctions manage right-of-way regulations.

Classical routing solu-\ntions, such as the Dijkstra algorithm and A* [15], greedily compute\nthe shortest path between the starting node and the target node.\nWhile these static routing algorithms are widely adopted in practice,\nthey do not account for the dynamic changes in road conditions in\nreal time. Recently, several works have proposed learning-based\nmodels for real-time vehicle navigation, where the navigation task\nis framed as a series of rerouting decisions [13, 16, 32]. These mod-\nels formulate the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem,\nwhere the vehicle learns to turn left, right, or go straight at up-\ncoming intersections based on its observations, including current\nlocation, destination information, and real-time traffic conditions.\nHowever, this single-path decision-making approach is prone to\ngetting trapped in local optima, leading to situations where vehi-\ncles become stuck in dead ends or deviate from the road network\nboundaries, failing to reach their destinations [28]."}, {"title": "2.3 Multi-Vehicle Control", "content": "Multi-vehicle control (MVC) represents a significant research area\nin robotics, autonomous systems, and transportation systems, fo-\ncusing on the coordination and control of multiple vehicles to\nefficiently execute collective tasks.

This process involves\ncomplex strategy coordination, including task allocation, communi-\ncation protocol design, and route planning and obstacle avoidance\nstrategies. Through effective communication mechanisms, vehicles\ncan exchange information to avoid potential conflicts on their paths,\nthereby reducing the risk of traffic accidents. Additionally, each\nvehicle must independently plan its trajectory to ensure it does not\ncollide with other vehicles or environmental obstacles, ultimately\noptimizing the total time for the entire fleet.

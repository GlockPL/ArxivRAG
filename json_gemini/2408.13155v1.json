However, it is challenging to understand the complex interactions among its biophysical, social, and economic components. Predictive machine learning (ML), with its capacity to learn from data, is leveraged in sustainable agriculture for applications like yield prediction and weather forecasting. Nevertheless, it cannot explain causal mechanisms and remains descriptive rather than prescriptive. To address this gap, we propose causal ML, which merges ML's data processing with causality's ability to reason about change. This facilitates quantifying intervention impacts for evidence-based decision-making and enhances predictive model robustness. We showcase causal ML through eight diverse applications that benefit stakeholders across the agri-food chain, including farmers, policymakers, and researchers.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The perception of agriculture is evolving.

Box 1). Causality-aware ML leverages the idea that associations coming from direct cause-effect relationships are the most stable (see apps in Sec. 3.4). By selecting these direct causes, models can rely on relationships that persist across different environments or contexts [36]. This enhances the models' robustness to interventions, spatio-temporal generalizability, and explainability. This selection can be guided by prior knowledge of the causal graph or through data-driven techniques such as Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) [37], which aims to discover features that exhibit consistent predictive capacity under various experimental settings, environments, regimes, or interventions. However, solely relying on direct causes may be too conservative for some problems. Anchor Regression [38] introduces a relaxation by incorporating weighted features that may extend beyond direct causes. This method allows the model to leverage additional information while prioritizing causal relationships, thus balancing accuracy and stability. Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) [39] and Risk extrapolation (REx) [40] are other methods that leverage causal principles to enhance model stability."}, {"title": "3 Applications of causal ML in agriculture", "content": "Causal ML is about answering causal queries (like the ones in Box 2), avoiding being right for the wrong reasons. We next showcase eight indicative applications of causal ML for sustainable agriculture (see Fig. 2); from advancing science to assisting policymakers, empowering farmers, and improving models. We characterize them with estimated levels of leverage, adoption risk, and impact. By leverage, we mean that the application can be realized and provide major changes and improvements with relatively small or focused efforts. Adoption risk refers to the challenges in getting scientists, policymakers, or farmers to use the outputs of the applications. Impact signifies the application's potential to create significant positive outcomes in the targeted areas."}, {"title": "3.1 Advancing science", "content": "Food security exemplifies complex systems with causal mechanisms that vary across scales, contexts, and time. Next to environmental stressors (e.g., persistent droughts), socio-economic factors such as poverty, poor market access, and lack of employment drive chronic food insecurity at the regional level [41]. Local shocks, like climate extremes, and food price spikes drive sudden drops in regional food availability and exacerbate food security issues. Additionally, global market dynamics and trade routes, influenced by regional disruptions, impact food prices and availability elsewhere [42]. The complexity of these systems challenges domain experts. Data-driven causal discovery techniques can complement expertise by analyzing large datasets to uncover hidden or emerging patterns (Fig. 2, app 1). For instance, researchers [43] used a committee of causal discovery algorithms that collectively voted on the causal relationships between socioeconomic factors and famine risk in Uganda. Capturing the relationships in a causal graph enhances scientific understanding of underlying mechanisms and how they vary, aids in improving predictions of famine across different environments and contexts (cf. Sec. 3.4), and facilitates the estimation of effects of various interventions on food security (cf. Sec. 3.2). We assess this application as having low leverage, a medium level of adoption risk among domain scientists, and a moderate impact."}, {"title": "Intercomparison of crop growth models", "content": "Crop growth models are essential for predicting yields, simulating environmental impacts, and optimizing resource use. However, current crop models exhibit large differences in their sensitivities to drivers such as carbon dioxide, temperature, and water [44], leading to uncertainty in projections of future global yields [45]. The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) aims to improve crop growth models for assessing climate impacts on agriculture by conducting extensive protocol-based model intercomparisons. Inspired by the work of [46], who applied causal discovery algorithms to compare climate models, a similar approach could be implemented for the inter-comparison of crop growth models (Fig. 2, app 2). Simulations generated by various process-based crop growth models serve as inputs for causal discovery algorithms. The resulting causal graphs can be then compared using specific causal graph metrics with those derived from observational data to evaluate alignment with the actual causal structure of crop growth. This method offers an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation and improvement that goes beyond sensitivity analyses and enhances the reliability and accuracy of crop growth predictions. We assess this application as having high leverage, since crop growth models are already in place, a medium level of adoption risk among domain scientists, and a moderate impact."}, {"title": "3.2 Assisting policymakers", "content": "Assessing the impact of policies, farmer decisions, or subsidies (treatments) on sustainability outcomes in agriculture is vital for evidence-based decision-making (Fig. 2, app 3). For example, we can assess the impact of humanitarian aid, where cash transfers provide financial assistance to individuals and households during extreme droughts in the Horn of Africa [47]. By estimating the ATE, we can measure the overall impact of these transfers on food security indicators, such as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), thus providing humanitarian organizations with evidence to design actionable responses. Shifting perspective, it is also useful to cast natural phenomena as the treatment of interest. For example, by understanding how extreme weather events, such as heatwaves or droughts, affect crop production, we can develop risk management strategies and support farmers in adapting (Fig. 2, app 4). Quantifying the overall impact of broader human and natural interventions is assessed as having high leverage, a medium level of adoption risk among policymakers, and a high impact."}, {"title": "Personalizing sustainable practices", "content": "Achieving sustainability goals in agriculture requires a shift from traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to geospatially tailored strategies [48]. The impact of agricultural practices varies across different regions due to local conditions. Leveraging CATE methods facilitates the assessment of these varying effects (Fig. 2, app 5) which in turn enables the prioritization of the most beneficial practices for each land unit. For example, [49] measured the CATE of crop rotation on net primary productivity (NPP) and proposed using it as a suitability score for applying crop rotation. They also explored which variables drove effect heterogeneity and showed that high min. temperatures combined with low water deficit increased the positive impact of crop rotation. We assess this application as having low leverage, as it requires large amounts of high-quality local data, a high level of adoption risk among policymakers and farmers, and a high impact."}, {"title": "3.3 Empowering farmers", "content": "Digital agriculture tools, such as decision support systems and smart farming technologies, hold great promise for enhancing sustainability. However, low adoption rates remain a challenge. Evaluating their impact on farmers' profits can promote wider adoption (see Fig. 2, app 6). For instance, [50] estimated a 12-17% increase in crop yield for farmers who followed optimal day-of-sowing recommendations. Analyses like this can provide clear evidence, helping farmers make informed decisions and building trust in these technologies. Quantifying the effectiveness of digital agriculture tools also supports fair service fees and allows farmers to conduct accurate cost-benefit analyses.We assess this application as having low leverage due to data access issues, a medium level of adoption risk among farmers, and a moderate impact."}, {"title": "3.4 Improving predictive modeling", "content": "Causality-aware ML can improve predictive modeling in agriculture by addressing challenges related to model stability [36] (Fig. 2, app 7 and 8). For instance, global information on national-level crop yield forecasting is key for food security crisis prevention and response planning. However, the uneven distribution of available training data, typically limited in time and quality for food-insecure countries, poses challenges for supervised models. Causality-aware ML methods (see Sec. 2.2), which focus on causal, stable variables, can offer a better geographic generalization for these models [51]. Additionally, these methods can offer robustness to interventions over time. For example, they can improve the resilience of pest prediction models when faced with changes in pest control strategies or anomalous environmental events [52]. We assess these applications as having high leverage, as they capitalize on existing predictive models and their datasets, a low level of adoption risk among data modelers, and a moderate impact."}, {"title": "4 Discussion and outlook", "content": "We highlighted the potential of causal ML in promoting agricultural sustainability and addressing food security problems through two key approaches: enhancing the stability of predictive models (causality for ML) and answering causal questions (ML for causality). The applications we discussed demonstrate how causal ML can generate actionable insights to empower stakeholders, from farmers to global agricultural managers. We introduced a causal ML workflow to ensure the effective and reliable application of causal ML for sustainable agroecosystems. Five elements should be worked out and integrated, all coming with their challenges and opportunities:In pursuit of effective agricultural decisions, addressing the causal questions inherent in agroecosystem management is key. However, explicit causal language necessary for articulating these questions is largely absent in agriculture. Domain experts possess valuable knowledge that can be translated into a causal graph, which, when faithfully constructed, can be used alongside ML methods to answer causal queries. Correctly defining the causal question is important; it must be relevant, precise, and feasible so that variables are measured accurately and appropriately [18].Agroecosystems are complex to model, predict, and understand, and involve nonlinearities and non-stationarities [17, 28, 53]. Effective analysis requires careful curation and harmonization of diverse data sources, including multi-modal Earth observation data and economic and social variables. High-resolution economic or social indicators like conflicts, GDP, and crop prices are often uncertain, less accessible, and inconsistently recorded compared to environmental data. The temporal and spatial scales of observation are importantconsiderations. For example, in shorter time frames, weather can cause fluctuations in crop yield, whereas over longer periods, the impact of agriculture on local climate can be measured. Data limitations are a significant concern, especially because in causal graphs, the variables at the nodes are conceptual and may not be directly observable. It is important to minimize the gap between proxies and the original concepts to maintain the integrity of the analysis.When randomization of treatment allocation is not possible, making specific assumptions is necessary to move from correlations to causal conclusions (cf. Box 1 and Sec. 2.1). Structural, process, and statistical assumptions should be transparently laid out to ensure appropriate integration with data curation and method selection within the workflow. Assessing the plausibility of these assumptions is a necessary step [35]; it relies heavily on expert domain knowledge. Their adequacy may also be evaluated by checking the performance of the entire causal ML workflow during validation. An important type of assumption not discussed in Sec. 2.1 regards how causal structure leads to spatial dependence. If spatial assumptions are not adequate this may lead to spatial biases [54]. For example, chemical pesticides used by one farmer may impact the water quality for irrigation in neighboring fields as they seep into the groundwater (spillover).Once the data curation and assumption elements have been established to answer the causal question of interest, selecting a method involves choosing one that aligns with these elements. For example, for causal discovery questions if we are unwilling to assume there is no unmeasured confounding then we must choose a method such as FCI [25] that relaxes this assumption.Gaps in the causal ML literature for agriculture include: scalable algorithms for mixed data types, high-dimensional data, and non-stationary causal relations [53]; methods that account for unit interactions [54]; and causal representation learning methods for raw unstructured data [13].Establishing a database of causal graphs for agriculture based on expert knowledge is recommended. These graphs can then serve as a benchmark for evaluating different causal discovery algorithms and guide the definition of downstream causal effect estimation tasks. Ground truth data for effect estimates is typically not available. Instead, process-based models can be utilized: ground-truth causal effects can be extracted directly from their equations. Additionally, these equations can be used to generate artificial data. The causal effect estimation method is then evaluated on its ability to recover the ground-truth effects from the artificial data accurately. Another option is to combine observational effect estimates with randomized experiments [20]. Model stability in causality-aware predictive models should be evaluated based on metrics like geographic generalization, transferability, or robustness to policy changes.We recommend engagement in benchmark activities like those conducted by AgML/AgMIP [55] and making use of systematic evaluation platforms like causeme [56]. These initiatives foster collaboration, standardization, and continuous improvement in validating and evaluating (causal) ML methods in"}, {"title": "Competing Interests", "content": "The authors declare no competing interests."}]}

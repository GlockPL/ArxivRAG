A large number of these pretrained models follow a multi-layer architectural blueprint: a sequence mixer, such as Self-Attention [41], aggregates information across the input sequence, followed by a channel mixer processes information within each sequence element. Over the years, Attention has been the predominant choice for sequence mixing due to its ability to facilitate direct pairwise interactions between elements of the input sequence in a single step. However, this capability incurs a quadratic cost with respect to sequence length, making the training and deployment of these models prohibitively expensive for longer sequences. Although numerous alternatives have been proposed, designing principled sequence models that match the performance and versatility of attention-based systems remains a substantial challenge.\nOne general strategy in designing alternative sequence models involves substituting the Attention matrix with different matrix parameterizations as the core sequence mixer. These modifications are motivated by various goals. For instance, simplifying the sequence mixer has led to the development of models such as MLP-Mixer [39], which uses dense matrices, and FNet [23], which utilizes the Discrete Fourier Transform matrix. Additionally, incorporating inductive biases such as positional information has resulted in the use of Toeplitz matrices in models like TNN [32]. Enhancing computational efficiency has spurred the creation of low-rank structures in models like Linear Attention (LA) [22] and Linformer [44], as well as Monarch matrices [5] in models such as M2 [13]."}, {"title": "The Matrix Mixer Framework:\nBridging Sequence Mixers and Structured Matrices", "content": "In Section 2.1, we formally define the matrix mixer framework, conceptualizing sequence mixers as linear maps on input sequences.

Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}$ be the input sequence, consisting of $L$ elements, each with $C$ channels. Let $f_X : \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times D}$ be the input preprocessing function that encapsulates common data transformations. Let $H$ and $P$ be the number of heads and head dimension respectively, such that $HP = D$. Let $\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ represent the underlying class of mixer matrices. For each head $h \\in [H]$, let $f_\\theta : \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C} \\times \\Theta \\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}$ be the matrix construction function that maps input data to mixer matrices, where $\\Theta$ is the space of learnable parameters. We denote $M^h = f_\\theta (X, \\theta)$, when $M, \\theta, X$ are clear from the context. Then, we define matrix mixing as,\n$Y^h = M^h (f_X (X))^h,$\nwhere $(f_X (X))^h, Y^h$ denote the preprocessed input and output slice corresponding to head $h$.\nThis definition encapsulates the view that existing sequence mixers can be mathematically represented as $L \\times L$ mixer matrices that act on the sequence length (see Figure 1, left). The framework not only incorporates typical data preprocessing steps like projections [22, 38], and short convolutions [16, 6], but it also accommodates data dependent mixer matrices [38, 33]. Furthermore, it is also powerful enough to capture the concept of head structure [41] by equivalently sharing the mixer matrices within a head.\nMoreover, Definition 2.1 offers a different lens to conceptualize the computational cost of sequence mixers. If we assume that both the preprocessing function and the matrix construction function are sub-quadratic in the sequence length $L$, which is generally true in practice, then the computational bottleneck lies in the $M f_X (X)$ operation. For a general matrix $M$, this multiplication will incur a $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost. The only way to mitigate this to restrict $M$ to being a structured matrix, which are known to possess sub-quadratic matrix multiplication algorithms. We refer to such sequence mixers as structured matrix mixers. This paves the way to systematically develop new sequence mixers: select an appropriate class of structured matrices from established mathematical literature, devise a data-dependent matrix construction function, and integrate them into the matrix mixer framework."}, {"title": "Sequence Aligned Matrices", "content": "Unstructured mixer matrices, also known as dense matrices, lack two key useful properties: 1) these matrix mixers cannot be easily made data-dependent, which has been identified as a key property of performant sequence models such as Transformers and Mamba, and 2) they can only be applied to fixed-length sequences, a property we call extendability. Due to substantial importance of these features for sequence mixers, we formally define the class Sequence Aligned Matrices (SAM) to systematically explore matrices that are characterized with both properties.\nDefinition 2.2 (Sequence Aligned Matrices). Let $L$ be the sequence length and let $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ denote a matrix with a parameter set $\\mathcal{P}$. Then, we say that $M$ is a Sequence Aligned Matrix if there exists a partition $\\Pi$ of $\\mathcal{P} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$, and $\\mathcal{P} \\neq \\emptyset$, such that for all sets $\\mathcal{E} \\in \\Pi$, there exists a bijective map $f_\\varepsilon : [L] \\rightarrow \\mathcal{E}$, and, for each $i \\in [L]$, the sub-matrix $M[:i+1, :i+1]$ is composed solely from the parameters in the subset $\\bigcup_{\\varepsilon \\in \\Pi} \\bigcup_{k \\leq i} f_{\\varepsilon}(k) \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}$.\nIn simpler terms, this implies that each parameter of a SAM is either mapped to a specific element of the sequence or is left data-independent, ensuring that every upper-left sub-matrix upto index $i$ is constructed using only the parameters corresponding sequence segment upto and including index $i$ and/or the data-independent ones.\nProposition 2.3 (Data Dependency). Sequence aligned matrices exhibit canonical data-dependent parameterization.\nProof. This property arises from the parameter partition structure guaranteed in the definition. Specifically, for each partition we associate a parametric function that, for any given element $i$ computes the parameter's value by treating the element itself as an input. \nProposition 2.4 (Extendability). Sequence aligned sequence mixers can be extended beyond their trained length.\nProof. This is a direct consequence of Proposition 2.3: the pretrained parametric functions assigned to each partition enable the computation of matrices larger than those encountered during training. \nWe identify data dependency \u2013 the property induced by SAM as a key axis of differentiation amongst existing models. Although data-dependency is a popular notion that is widely regarded as being crucial to performance of Attention, it lacked any formal definition in the literature. Consequently, various works have adopted different interpretations of this notion: Hyena [30] implements it via a data-dependent linear operators over the Toeplitz matrix mixer; GSS [26] adds a data-dependent gate post sequence mixing; LA, SSD [22, 6], like Attention, directly map input data to the parameters of the matrix mixer. Using our definition of data dependency that aligns with the third interpretation, it is clear that models like Hydra, SSD, and LA are data-dependent, whereas MLP-Mixer, FNet, S4, S4D, and TNN, only have data-independent parameters."}, {"title": "Prior Sequence Models as (Structured) Matrix Mixers", "content": "Using the formalization of the Matrix Mixer framework, we categorize a wide array of previous works \u2013 MLP-Mixer [39], Transformer [41], Linear Attention [22], Linformer [44], S4 [18, 17], H3 [14], TNN [32], CKConv [36], FNet [23], Kaleidoscope [8, 7], Monarch [5, 13], and Mamba [16, 6] as matrix mixers in Table 1. For illustrative purposes, we explicitly show that MLP-Mixer, FNet and LA are matrix mixers (proofs in Appendix B), and leave out normalizing factors for simplicity as follows:\nProposition 2.5. (MLP-Mixer is a matrix mixer). MLP-Mixer employs $f_X$ as an identity function, and its mixer matrix $M$ has an unstructured parameterization with a single head ($H = 1$).\nProposition 2.6. (LA is a structured matrix mixer with sequence alignment). LA employs $f_X$ as a linear projection $f_X (X, W_V) = XW_V$, with its low-rank mixer matrix being SAM. The mixer matrix $M$ has $H$ heads with a structured parameterization, where each $(i, j)$-element $m_{ij}$ is defined as:\n$m_{ij} = \\phi(x_i W_Q) \\phi(x_j W_K)^T, \\quad \\phi(\\cdot) = elu(\\cdot) + 1, \\quad W_Q, W_K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times D}.$\nAdditionally, it is important to note that not all structured matrix mixers inherently exhibit sequence alignment. For example, consider the matrix mixer formulation $M = W_Q W_K^T$ where $W_Q, W_K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}$ are trainable parameters. This formulation yields a low-rank matrix mixer, which qualifies as a structured matrix mixer. However, this structure is independent of the input data, directly contradicting the concept of SAM. Another illustrative example is FNet:\nProposition 2.7. (FNet is a structured matrix mixer without sequence alignment). FNet employs $f_X$ as an identity function, using the canonical Vandermonde matrix \u2013 Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) \u2013 for its mixer matrix. The mixer matrix $M$ has a single head ($H = 1$) with a structured parameterization, where each $(p, q)$-element $m_{pq}$ is defined as $m_{pq} = w_q^p$, where $w = e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{N}}$.\nUsing these definitions, we present a series of matrix mixers, incorporating various mixer matrices both with and without the SAM property, and provide extensive experimental evaluations to investigate the influence of SAM on the expressivity of sequence mixers in Section 4.1.1."}, {"title": "The Matrix Mixer Framework as a Creative Toolbox", "content": "Armed with this framework, we illustrate how more classes of performant sequence models can be derived. In particular, we introduce Vandermonde and Cauchy matrix mixers, chosen because they are: 1) well-known families of structured matrices with sub-quadratic matrix multiplication, hence are efficient as sequence models, and 2) we show that they have SAM parameterizations. In Section 4.1.1, we validate that these properties are enough to create efficient and strong sequence models, e.g. our Cauchy matrix mixer is on par with LA. This validates the central theme of this paper that developing sequence models can be reduced to choosing structured matrix classes with target properties. We assume an input sequence $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}$ is given, and utilize the prevalent query-key concept that we employ $Q = X W_Q, K = X W_K$ where $W_Q, W_K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times D}$. For simplicity, we show the single-headed ($H = 1$) case, where $D = P$. Further details including the implementations of multi-headed extensions are in Appendix E.\nSequence aligned Vandermonde mixer. In contrast to FNet, which employs a fixed-parameter Vandermonde mixer based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), we propose a trainable, and data-dependent Vandermonde-based matrix mixer. Then, we can construct a mixer matrix from a combination of two separate Vandermonde matrices $M_Q$, $M_K$, each generated from $Q$ and $K$. Specifically, each $(i, j)$-element of the resulting mixer matrix $M$ is formulated as $m_{ij} = \\sum_a (cos(2 \\pi q_a) - cos(2 \\pi k_a))$. This formulation utilizes the cosine function \u2013 the real part of an imaginary number \u2013 which is a well established technique used in SSMs [17, 28] to prevent the potential for excessive values resulting from the powers of elements. Thanks to the associative property of matrix multiplications, our sequence aligned Vandermonde matrix mixer enjoys algorithms with efficient computational complexities.\nSequence aligned Cauchy mixer. As indicated by the definition of Cauchy matrices in Table 1, the underlying philosophy of using both the Cauchy and low-rank matrix classes as a sequence mixer is remarkably similar: the relevance of a pair of elements is directly proportional to their associated value \u2013 the greater the relevance, the higher value assigned. Specifically, each $(i, j)$-element of the mixer matrix $M$ is constructed by $m_{ij} = \\sum_d \\frac{1}{(q_{id} - k_{jd} + c)}$, where $c$ is a trainable"}, {"title": "Hydra: The Double-Headed Mamba", "content": "In this section, we introduce Hydra, a novel sequence-to-sequence model through a bidirectional extension of Mamba. We briefly begin with a preliminary background that SSMs are semiseparable matrix mixers (Section 3.1). Then, we motivate the design choice of Hydra under the domain of the matrix mixer framework. Specifically, we opt for quasiseparable matrices as our matrix mixer, a choice grounded by solid mathematical foundations (Section 3.2). Additionally, we underline the computational benefits and enhanced parameter efficiency afforded by adopting quasiseparable matrices (Section 3.3)."}, {"title": "Background: State Space Models are Semiseparable Matrix Mixers", "content": "SSD [6], the latest advancement in the iterations of SSMs, presents a sub-quadratic sequence mixer that attains language modeling performance on-par with Attention. Crucially, SSD underscores that all SSMs are inherently parameterized by semiseparable matrices, which play a pivotal role in their computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. Specifically, the operational essence of selective SSMs such as Mamba \u2013 the transformation of an input sequence $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C} \\xrightarrow[]{f_X} Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}$ \u2013 can be succinctly represented within the matrix mixer framework, as detailed below:\n$Y = \\sum_{t=0}^{L-1} c A^t B X_t,$\n(1)\n$A_{ij}^n = \\begin{cases}\n\\prod_{k=j+1}^{i} A_k & \\text{ for } i > j \\\n1 & \\text{ for } i = j\n\\end{cases}$\n(2)\n$Y = SSM(A, B, C) (X) = MX$\n$m_{ij} = \\begin{cases} c_i A_{ij}^n B_j & \\text{ if } i > j \\\n\\text{N} & \\text{N} \\\n\\end{cases}$\nHere, $m_{ij}$ represents an $(i, j)$-element of the mixer matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$, with each matrix $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ and vector $c_i, b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$ as time-varying parameters of selective SSMs. This formulation reveals that the mixer matrices $M$ follow a fundamental class of structured matrices known as semiseparable matrices, defined as follows:\nDefinition 3.1 (The rank characterization of semiseparable matrices). A lower triangular matrix $M$ is N-semiseparable iff any submatrix from the lower triangle (on or below the diagonal) has a rank of at most N. See Figure 2 (a).\nHowever, a key limitation of these matrices \u2013 and by extension, SSMs \u2013 is their inherent causality, which restricts their use in scenarios where bidirectional processing is vital. To circumvent this limitation, previous efforts [43, 15, 12] have explored employing two separate SSMs, one for forward and the other for backward sequence processing, then combine the outputs using strategies like element-wise addition, the Hadamard product, or concatenation. Among such heuristics, addition-based bidirectional extensions of SSMs [15, 47, 37] can be conceptualized within our matrix mixer framework, as illustrated in Figure 2 (c)."}, {"title": "Quasiseparable Matrices: A Principled Bidirectional Matrix Mixer", "content": "We fully utilize the matrix mixer framework, which is discussed in Section 2, to explore a novel bidirectional sequence mixer and identify quasiseparable matrices as a prime candidate. Our exploration focuses on structured matrix classes that meet the following criteria: 1) they feature upper triangular components for bidirectionality, 2) they possess strong expressivity, and 3) they benefit from sub-quadratic matrix multiplication algorithms.\nThe structural design of quasiseparable matrices inherently meets the first criterion, which is defined as follows: a matrix $M$ is N-quasiseparable if each element $m_{ij}$ satisfies\n$m_{ij} = \\begin{cases} c_i A_{ij} \\overrightarrow{b_j}, & \\text{ if } i > j \\\n\\delta_i, & \\text{ if } i = j, \\\n\\overleftarrow{A_{ij}} b_i, & \\text{ if } i < j\n\\end{cases}$\n(3)\nwhere each $\\delta_i$ is a scalar, $b_i, c_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$, and $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ [4]. Clearly, this matrix class features non-zero upper triangular components, enabling bidirectional processing.\nFurthermore, the second requirement \u2013 the expressivity of quasiseparable matrices \u2013 is confirmed by their rank characterization:\nDefinition 3.2 (The rank characterization of quasiseparable matrices [29]). A matrix $M$ is N-quasiseparable iff any submatrix from either the strictly upper or lower triangle (off from the diagonal) has a rank of at most N. See Figure 2 (b).\nThis definition emphasizes the rank constraint inherent in quasiseparable matrices, which is also evident from Equation (3) given that each vector $c_i, b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$ and matrix $A_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ has a rank of at most N. This structural flexibility of quasiseparable matrices directly leads to significant generalizations, extending the capabilities of both low-rank and semiseparable matrices.\nCorollary 3.3. Quasiseparable matrices generalize low-rank matrices.\nCorollary 3.4. Quasiseparable matrices generalize and extend semiseparable matrices.\nAdditionally, we revisit the previous addition-based bidirectional extensions of SSMs [15, 47, 37] through the lens of our matrix mixer framework. Unlike other elements, the diagonal values in a mixer matrix embody a unique concept of residuals, serving as a critical aspect of model expressivity. As demonstrated in Figure 2 (c), the mixer matrices in these bidirectional SSMs exhibit constraints in their diagonal elements {cbi + c\u2192bi }L, which are directly influenced by the shared non-diagonal construction vectors {c, b, c, bi}. Importantly, the rank characterization of semiseparable matrices includes on-diagonal elements, whereas that of quasiseparable matrices applies only to off-diagonal submatrices. This generosity in the rank-based definition suggests that sequence models employing quasiseparable mixers not only offer inherent extendability in handling both causal and bidirectional processing, but also exhibit strong expressivity.\nCorollary 3.5. Quasiseparable matrices are strictly more expressive than mixer matrices of addition-based bidirectional SSMs.\nLeveraging this inherent flexibility of quasiseparable matrix mixers, our Hydra in Section 3.3 is defined by incorporating shift operations. Our experimental results strikingly confirm that this nuanced parameterization difference leads to a notable improvement in downstream task performance, thereby substantiating our theoretical claims (see Section 4.1.2).\nMoreover, with their structural similarity to semiseparable matrices, quasiseparable matrices are confirmed as sequence aligned matrices. Given our experimental results that SAM parameterizations are the key to the strong representational power (Section 4.1.1), we further validate our choice of quasiseparable matrices for the bidirectional sequence mixer.\nProposition 3.6. N-quasiseparable matrices are sequence aligned matrices.\nProof. quasiseparable matrices, due to their structural similarity to semiseparable matrices, belong to the class of Sequence Aligned matrices. Specifically, the set of parameters is given by $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{P} = \\{A_i, b_i, c_i, \\delta_i\\}_L$. We consider the partition $\\Pi = \\{\\{A_i\\}_L, \\{b_i\\}_L, \\{c_i\\}_L, \\{\\delta_i\\}_L\\}$, and for each element of the partition set, we choose the bijection that maps token $i$ to $A_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$, and $\\delta_i$ respectively. Finally, it is easy to see that the sub-matrix $M[:i+1, :i+1]$ indeed only contains parameters in the set $\\{A_j, b_j, c_j, \\delta_j\\}_i$, thus satisfying the last requirement of SAM matrices."}, {"title": "Taming the Hydra", "content": "In Section 3.3, we detail how quasiseparable sequence mixer can be effectively implemented using existing SSM frameworks to achieve sub-quadratic multiplication efficiencies, fulfilling the final criterion of our matrix mixer exploration."}, {"title": "Taming the Hydra", "content": "As a direct consequence of the favorable mathematical properties of quasiseparable matrices, we present a new sequence mixer Hydra. We adopt quasiseparable matrices as matrix mixers in Hydra, which bring forth three significant advantages: 1) higher representational power compared to its heuristic alternatives, 2) easy to implement sub-quadratic matrix multiplication algorithm, and 3) significant parameter savings.\nWe exploit the relationship between semiseparable and quasiseparable matrices to develop an easy-to-implement, sub-quadratic matrix multiplication algorithm. Specifically, we recognize that quasiseparable matrices can be expressed as a combination of two semiseparable matrices.\nProposition 3.7. Let $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times D}$ be the input sequence, and let $QS(\\cdot)$ and $SS(\\cdot)$ denote the action of a quasiseparable and semiseparable matrix respectively. Let the two matrices share the parameters $\\{A_i, b_i, c_i\\}_L$, and define $D = diag(\\delta_1, \\cdots, \\delta_L)$, where $\\delta_i$'s are the diagonal parameters of the quasiseparable matrix. Then,\n$QS(X) = shift(SS(X)) + flip(shift(SS(flip(X)))) + DX,$\nwhere $flip(\\cdot)$ denotes the operation that reverses the input sequence, while $shift(\\cdot)$ refers to shifting the sequence right by one position, padding the beginning with zero.\nThe above proposition demonstrates that quasiseparable matrix multiplication can be decomposed into two operations of semiseparable matrix multiplication with simple functions such as flip and shift. Given that semiseparable matrix structure encompasses SSMs, this flexibility allows for the selection of any SSM variant for implementation. In this paper, we employ SSD [6], chosen for its linear-time and dedicated hardware-efficient implementation. However, the architecture of Hydra is compatible with a variety of SSMs [18, 17, 16, 6] and can also be generalized with other recurrent models [46, 28].\nFurthermore, Hydra significantly improves parameter over the heuristic approaches to bidirectional modeling using SSMs [15, 47, 43, 12]. For example, some approaches utilize two distinct SSMs, which doubles the number of training parameters. In contrast, since we conceptualize the model as a quasiseparable matrix mixer (see Figure 4), we naturally share the $f_X$ projection layer, which accounts for a bulk of the model size. Empirically, we observe only a marginal increase in the total number of parameters compared to a single SSM, and can cut the the number of parameters nearly in half compared to the heuristic approaches to bidirectionality."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "In Section 4.1, we begin by analyzing the matrix mixer framework through extensive performance comparisons between different structured matrix classes (Section 4.1.1).

Furthermore, we compare our method against other ad-hoc solutions that extend SSMs to acquire bidirectionality (Section 4.1.2), and show that our Hydra outperforms them, underscoring the utility of the matrix view of sequence mixers.\nThen, in Section 4.2, we validate the effectiveness of our method by evaluating Hydra on quintessential language and image benchmark tasks: Masked Language Modeling (Section 4.2.1) and Image Classification (Section 4.2.2). State-of-the-art performance in both tasks has generally been dominated by transformer-based models [10, 11].

Further details of the experimental setup are provided in Appendix E.\nResults. The results distinctly highlight the substantial advantage in expressivity conferred by the SAM property (Definition 2.2). Previously, the high performance observed in [22, 44] was attributed to their low-rank based mixer matrices, particularly emphasized by the query-key $Q K^T$ interaction. The results show that the structures of mixer matrices affect the capability of sequence models. However, we demonstrate that the key factor that primarily contributes to significant improvements in the expressivity of sequence models is not the query-key formulation, but rather the SAM property. Through our systematic extension, we adapt six structured matrix families \u2013 Toeplitz, Vandermonde, Cauchy, low-rank, Attention, and quasiseparable \u2013 to include the SAM property (see Appendix E for implementation details). This adaptation reveals that the sequence-aligned Cauchy variant performs nearly as well as the sequence-aligned low-rank variant, which characterizes LA.

Unlike many off-the-shelf models such as CNN-based [19, 25] and vision-specialized Transformers [24] that include additional techniques such as hierarchical spatial downsampling to boost accuracy, our approach involves substituting only the sequence mixer layers within the ViT architecture. In addition, as opposed to other baselines in the setting of [30], our method uses no tuning over the default ViT recipe except for droppath.

While structured matrix mixers are computationally more efficient than their dense matrix mixer counterparts like softmax attention, they are also representationally less expressive, which may be seen as a limitation of these methods. For instance, concurrent works [1, 2, 21] have begun investigating the representational power of SSMs by analyzing their performance on memorization-centric tasks. They report that SSMs with a fixed model capacity are eventually outperformed by softmax attention for longer sequences. This can be viewed as a consequence of the matrix being too structured, and hence too inexpressive for the problem.\nOn the other hand, we remark that the degree of structure of a structured matrix is a knob that can be tuned according to the specific task, that is we can tradeoff the computational efficiency of the method for larger expressivity. For instance, within the structured matrix class of low rank matrices, we can tune the rank upto the size of the matrix, which is the sequence length. As the rank of the matrix class increases so does its expressive power; however, at the same time it also diminishes the compute efficiency associated with the matrix being low rank.\nAs another example, we demonstrate this tradeoff on the performance of SSMs on retrieval-style tasks for SSD, which is the modern variant of Mamba. Specifically, we show that SSD is able to recover the accuracy attained by softmax attention once we control for the compute capacity of the model. In contrast, hardware limitations of the selective scan algorithm make it impractical to match the compute capacity in Mamba, explainingthe emerging findings from [1, 2, 21] that SSMs underperform on memorization-centric tasks. This makes it evident that the development and analysis of SSMs is an active area of research with substantial room for exploration and improvement.\nHardware Efficiency: Despite the fact that structured matrices have associated sub-quadratic matrix multiplication algorithms, their implementation may not be hardware-friendly, which can reduce the execution speed in practice. For instance, one of the core advantages of Transformer is the hardware-friendly nature of its architectural design, mainly composed of pure matrix multiplications."}, {"title": "Broader Impact", "content": "This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning.

MLP-Mixer is a Matrix Mixer\nProof. Recall that MLP-Mixer applies a weight-shared, per-channel linear projection on the input sequence. Since MLP-Mixer does not pre-process the input sequence, we set $f_X$ to be the identity function. Additionally, since the mixer matrix is data independent and is learned as a free parameter, we define the class $\\mathcal{M} := \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$, and set $f_M (X; \\theta) := \\theta^3$, for $\\theta \\varepsilon \\Theta$, where $\\Theta := \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Since MLP-Mixer shares the matrix across all channels, the number of heads $H = 1$.

We pretrain on the C4 dataset, and follow the recipe from MosaicBERT [31] which has been widely adopted in recent works - the models are trained for 70k steps with a batch size of 4096. We adopt the same hyperparameters as M2 [13] for pretraining, including the optimizer, learning rate schedule, and the bert-base uncased tokenizer. We employ the controlled setting from [20] for finetuning models on the GLUE benchmark. Specifically, we utilize weights pretrained on the C4 corpus for the five tasks \u2013 MNLI, QNLI, QQP, SST2, and COLA \u2013 and finetune RTE, STSB, and MRPC from an MNLI checkpoint. For reliability, the performance metrics reported represent the average scores from five runs for each GLUE task, with seeds selected completely at random.\nThe well-established BERT and M2 models benefit from highly optimized training and finetuning recipes [20, 13]. Therefore, we perform a short sweep for the learning rate and number of epochs for finetuning tasks to obtain the best results. To note, we ensure that the number of epochs do not surpass their original values for fairness. In Table 7 first row, we observe that Hydra of 24 layers trained using the M2 recipe out-of-the-box outperforms both BERT (83.5) and M2 (80.9) on the GLUE benchmark without any hyperparameter tuning. From the tuned hyperparameter, Hydra with 23 layers (second row) gains additional improvements, outperforming the results obtained by using the M2 recipe.\nIn Table 8, we report extended results for our GLUE comparisons (Table 4), including reference numbers directly reported from the literature. We include these to show that our results are a fair comparison of different models using our internally-consistent training framework, and that our baselines are strong and generally consistent with those found in MosaicBERT [31].\nImageNet-1K. For Table 5, we use 12 layers for the Transformer [41], S4ND [27], and Hyena [30] blocks, and set to 24 layers for Mamba and Hydra to match the number of parameters. The training involves images of 224 \u00d7 224 resolution, tokenized using a 16 \u00d7 16 patchifying layer. For Hydra, we adopt a row-major ordering to flatten patches and deliberately exclude positional embeddings. The models are trained over 300 epochs, leveraging hyperparameters primarily sourced from a standard training recipe [24], including an initial learning rate of 1e \u2013 4 and a batch size of 1024. We also incorporate regular ImageNet-1K training techniques [40], such as augmentation and regularization strategies. All other configurations remain consistent with the original ViT [11] setup, ensuring that any observed differences in performance can be directly attributed to the expressivity of the respective sequence mixer layers."}, {"title": "Additional Details of Ablation Studies in Table 2", "content": "To rigorously demonstrate the representational power of various families of matrix mixers, we ensure a fair comparison by meticulously controlling architectural hyperparameters. Specifically, all variants are constructed on the SSD [6] block, with a consistent configuration of 12 layers, an expansion factor of 2, and a hidden dimension (d_model) of 768. We then adjust the channel dimensions for qk_dim and headdim to keep the total parameter counts close to 70M. The models are pretrained for 24k steps in C4, each with a 4096 batch size, thus processing approximately 12.5B tokens in total. The finetuning phase adheres to the standardized protocol used for Hydra, ensuring comparability.\nThe primary differentiating factor among the variants is the mixer matrix M, which has two main configurable attributes: 1) the presence of the SAM property, and 2) the family of a mixer matrix. According to Definition 2.2, mixers with the SAM attribute contain parameters that are dynamically generated from elements of the input sequence, making them input data-dependent (Proposition 2.3). In contrast, variants without SAM are data-independent, with shared parameters across all inputs.

Here, H is the number of heads, and d represents the dimension for each head for keys and queries.\nThe class of structured matrices M used in LA is characterized as the class of Low Rank matrices. The matrix-generating function for each head h, denoted as fm, computes the matrix Mh as $M_h = \\sigma(Q_h)\\sigma(K_h)^T $.

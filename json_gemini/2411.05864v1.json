Introduction", "content": "Metaheuristic algorithms are powerful optimization techniques used to solve complex engineering problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional optimization methods. These algorithms are based on various mathematical and computational concepts and are designed to explore the search space efficiently, identify promising solutions, and converge to the optimal solution. However, despite their effectiveness, metaheuristic algorithms have limitations in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. For example, some metaheuristic algorithms may converge slowly or get stuck in local optima, while others may need numerous fitness evaluations to achieve the optimum solution. Additionally, as the complexity of the problem increases, the performance of metaheuristic algorithms may degrade, making them less effective in solving real-world engineering problems.\nTherefore, there is a need to improve the performance of metaheuristic algorithms to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness in solving complex engineering problems. This can be achieved by developing new and innovative algorithms that address the limitations of existing algorithms or by integrating various techniques, such as machine learning, opposition-based learning, and adaptive parameter control, into existing algorithms to enhance their performance. Moreover, improving the performance of metaheuristic algorithms can have significant implications for various engineering fields, such as mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering, where optimization plays a critical role in solving complex problems. It can lead to the development of more efficient and reliable systems, reduce costs, and improve productivity and safety [1-3]. Thus, research in this area is essential to address the challenges of the modern world and enhance the quality of life.\nOpposition-Based Learning (OBL) is a technique used in optimization algorithms to generate opposite solutions to the current population. In OBL, each individual solution in the population is paired with its opposite solution, which is created by changing the sign of each decision variable's value. The opposite solutions are then evaluated and added to the population if they improve the overall population's diversity or fitness. The idea behind OBL is to increase the population's diversity and prevent the optimization algorithm from being trapped in local optima. By generating opposite solutions, OBL can explore the search space in a more efficient way, leading to better convergence and better-quality solutions. The OBL is a powerful technique that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness"}, {"title": "2. Enhancing Methods for Population Diversity", "content": "To enhance the performance of optimization algorithms, particularly in terms of population diversity, both methods of Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) is used. The OBL involves the use of opposition pairs to enhance the diversity of the population. It creates a new individual by generating a mirror image of an existing individual with respect to the midpoint of the search space. By incorporating the opposite characteristics, OBL helps to increase the diversity of the population, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima and improving the algorithm's exploration ability. By combining this method with standard optimization algorithms, the performance of the algorithms can be enhanced, resulting in faster convergence rates, better population diversity, and more efficient exploration and exploitation abilities. These techniques are particularly useful when dealing with complex optimization problems that require a good balance between exploration and exploitation, such as engineering design problems."}, {"title": "2.1. Opposition-Based Learning", "content": "The first introduction of the opposition-based learning method was proposed by Tizhoosh [38] in the field of machine intelligence. The method is centered on the generation of an opposite number, which involves the production of a solution that is opposite to the current solution while being bounded within upper and lower limits. In other words, given a real number h that is confined within the range of a and b (h\u2208 [a, b]), its opposite can be obtained using the equation below.\n$\\bar{h}=b+a-h$  (1)"}, {"title": "2.2.

A comprehensive investigation of GSA and a brief review of its developments in solving various engineering problems were discussed in [40], aiming to build up a global picture to explore possible applications. This algorithm is according to Newton's theory of gravity, which posits that particles attract each other via a gravitational force.

Big Bang- Big Crunch", "content": "The Big Bang- Big Crunch (BB-BC) algorithm [41] is according to the Big Bang and Big Crunch theory and is computationally efficient with acceptable convergence speed. The BB-BC exhibits diverse adaptations, and it has found particular utility in engineering optimization specially the power systems. Its versatility and efficacy in addressing various challenges within this domain have led researchers to explore and develop different variations of the algorithm for improved performance. [42]. It has two stages: Big Bang generates random candidate solutions, while Big Crunch orders them based on quality. In each iteration, a new population is generated around the center of mass calculated during Big Crunch. After multiple iterations, randomness decreases, and the algorithm converges to a solution. After the Big Bang step in the BB-BC algorithm, the Big Crunch step is executed as a convergence operator. The output of the Big Crunch step is calculated by finding the center of mass using the inverse fitness function values as input. The resulting point, which serves as the center of mass, is denoted as x\u00ba.

Particle Swarm Optimization", "content": "The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm [43] is enhanced by a swarm of particles that continuously adjust their positions from one iteration to the next in order to optimize the search process. Considering the hybridization, enhancement, and various variants of the PSO, its real-world applications are categorized into several areas, such as health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications [44]. To achieve the best possible solution in PSO, each particle moves towards its own best previous position (pbest) as well as the overall best position (gbest) within the swarm. When the objective of the problem is minimization, the following equation holds true:\n$\\pbest\u2081 = x^*| f(x) = \\underset{k={1,2,...,t}}{\\min} (\\{f(x^k)\\}), \\quad i={1,2,...,N}$  (3)\nIn the given equation, i corresponds to the index of the particle, t indicates the current iteration number, f denotes the objective function that is being optimized or minimized, x represents the position vector of the particle (or a potential solution), and N signifies the total number of particles in the swarm.

Conclusions", "content": "This chapter investigated the efficiency of the Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) algorithms dealing with the optimization of a structural problem. To overcome metaheuristics' problems such as low convergence rate and sticking in the local optima, OBL was added to several optimization algorithms to enhanced their exploration and exploitation capabilities. The physics-based algorithms such as Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) were chosen for this study. The performance of the proposed algorithms was examined considering a forty-story tall building frame equipped with MR damper to find the optimum number and location of the control devices. The optimum design criteria were to reduce the structural response subjected to earthquake excitations (Northridge, Kobe, Landers) by considering the optimum location of the MR dampers. Various structural responses such as maximum inter-story drift, story acceleration, base shear, and their norm values were considered. Based on the obtained values of J indices, distribution patterns of the dampers denote the efficient performance of the system. According to results of the investigation, different distributed dampers can be achieved within the building height. The results were improved approximately 5% in average using the OBL technique considering their standard versions. Also, among the utilized methods, PSO outperforms its rivals in both standard OBL-based version."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 12% of all new cancer diagnoses and nearly 20% of all cancer deaths annually. It is primarily classified into two major types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which represents about 82% of cases, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is less common but more aggressive. Despite advancements in early detection and treatment, the prognosis for lung cancer patients remains poor, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 25%, underscoring the critical need for continued research and innovation in this field [1].\nSmoking is widely recognized as the leading risk factor for lung cancer, responsible for approximately 80% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. The carcinogenic compounds in tobacco smoke contribute significantly to the development of both NSCLC and SCLC. However, an increasing number of lung cancer cases are being diagnosed in individuals who have never smoked, particularly among women. This trend suggests that other factors, like genetic predispositions, environmental exposures (e.g., radon and air pollution), and hormonal influences, may play a critical role in lung cancer development among non-smokers. To enhance survival rates in non-smoking lung cancer patients, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis in NSCLC. This approach will help identify more effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and uncover new targets for drug development. [1], [2].\nStage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a com-plex disease, where accurate prognostic evaluation is key to personalized treatment. Detecting prognostic biomarkers can guide therapeutic decisions, potentially benefiting patients eligible for immunotherapy or targeted therapies. Recent studies, including a review on stage III NSCLC management, highlight the potential of biomarker-driven approaches to refine patient selection, improve outcomes, and advance personalized treatment strategies in this challenging lung cancer subset [3]. Given the poor prognosis of stage III NSCLC, reliable biomarkers could significantly enhance treatment effectiveness and survival rates [4].\nGene expression profiling measures the activity of thousands of genes simultaneously, offering insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseases like cancer. RNA is extracted from tissue samples, converted to cDNA, and analyzed using high-throughput technologies such as microarrays or next-generation sequencing (NGS). This data identifies differentially expressed genes, which can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting [5], [6].\nThe rapid expansion of the bioinformatics field such as gene"}, {"title": "II. DATA", "content": "This study utilized the publicly available dataset GDS3837 [14] from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, which provides comprehensive gene expression data for lung tissue specimens. The dataset includes expression profiles derived from both tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue, offering valuable insights into the molecular differences associated with lung cancer, particularly in non-smoking individuals. By leveraging this dataset, the study aimed to identify potential biomarkers and molecular signatures that could contribute to the understanding of lung cancer pathogenesis and aid in the development of targeted therapies.\n60 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue specimens were collected from non-smoking females at National Taiwan University Hospital and Taichung Veterans General Hospital, with written informed consent obtained from all participants. The lung tissues were promptly preserved in RNAlater buffer, quickly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C for subsequent RNA extraction. Of these, 60 sample pairs passed quality control and were processed for gene expression profiling. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent and purified with the RNeasy mini kit. Double-strand cDNA and CRNA were synthesized from purified RNA and hybridized to GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays (Affymetrix). After 16 hours of hybridization, the arrays were washed, scanned, and the resulting data were analyzed for mRNA expression levels using Partek software. The analysis included background correction, quantile normalization, and summarization through robust multiarray average analysis. [14], [15]."}, {"title": "B.

This outcome underscores the model's capability in handling complex genomic data and selecting relevant features, which are crucial for advancing our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms."}, {"title": "VI. DISCUSSION", "content": "The biomarkers identified by the XGBoost model in our study, including CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPa), lactate dehydrogenase A4 (LDHA), UNC-45 myosin chaperone B (UNC-45B), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF-1a), have been independently validated in the literature as being significantly associated with lung cancer.\nCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPa) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation. Research has demonstrated that C/EBPa acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, where its expression is often down-regulated. Studies using mouse models have shown that the deletion of C/EBPa significantly increases lung tumor incidence, particularly when induced by carcinogens like urethane. The reintroduction of C/EB\u03a1\u03b1 expression in lung cancer cells has been associated with growth arrest and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in lung cancer treatment [23].\nLactate dehydrogenase A4 (LDHA) plays a crucial role in glycolysis, where cancer cells rely on glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen. Elevated LDHA levels are associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis, contributing to the aggressive behavior of lung tumors by meeting the high metabolic demands of proliferating cancer cells. Similarly, UNC-45 myosin chaperone B (UNC-45B) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) are key proteins in lung cancer progression. Overexpression of UNC-45B enhances cellular motility and metastasis, while CHK1 supports cancer cell survival by repairing DNA damage. Targeting CHK1, particularly with DNA-damaging agents, and HIF-1\u03b1, a factor promoting tumor growth in hypoxic conditions, presents promising therapeutic avenues in lung cancer treatment [24]-[27]."}]}

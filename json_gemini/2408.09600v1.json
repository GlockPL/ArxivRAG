Existing mitigation strategies include alignment stage solutions (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024; Rosati et al. 2024a) and fine-tuning stage solutions (Huang et al. 2024; Mukhoti et al. 2023). However, our evaluation shows that both categories of defenses fail when some specific training hyper-parameters are chosen \u2013 a large learning rate or a large number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the defense, which however, is necessary to guarantee finetune performance. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution, which remains agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage. Antidote relies on the philosophy that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage. With this philosophy, we introduce a one-shot pruning stage after harmful fine-tuning to remove the harmful weights that are responsible for the generation of harmful content. Despite its embarrassing simplicity, empirical results show that Antidote can reduce harmful score while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Fine-tuning-as-a-service has become a new paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) service with an increasing demand for personalized service delivery. Typically, fine-tuning data are uploaded by the users, and the service provider (e.g., OpenAI) finetunes a pre-trained LLM (foundation model), which is then served to meet the users' customized need.\nBefore fine-tuning for user tasks, a pre-trained LLM is usually safety aligned to guarantee that the outputs of the LLM meet the safety preference, i.e., to refuse to generate harmful content even when the users trigger them to do so. However, recent studies (Qi et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023; Zhan et al. 2023) show that a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can trigger the model to forget the alignment knowledge it learned previously -it no longer uses refusal response when users submit a harmful prompt.\nExisting mitigation strategies can be broadly categorized into two categories, i.e., alignment stage defense and user fine-tuning stage defense. The first category is concerned with how to improve the large language model's immunization towards the harmful fine-tuning data in the alignment stage. For example, (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024) add artificial perturbation in the alignment stage to simulate the harmful embedding drift in the fine-tuning stage, and utilizes a minimax optimization to enforce the model to be immune to the perturbation. (Rosati et al. 2024b) utilize a representation noising technique to degrade the representation distribution of the harmful data to a random Gaussian noise, such that the harmful content generation is more difficult to learn by harmful fine-tuning data. For fine-tuning-stage mitigation, the core idea is to mitigate the forgetting of the alignment knowledge but also to learn the knowledge for the users' tasks. To achieve this goal, (Huang et al. 2024) separate the fine-tuning stage into two states, which alternatively optimize the alignment and fine-tuning dataset. (Mukhoti et al. 2023) add a regularization to constrain drift in feature space to mitigate the forgetting of alignment knowledge. However, our empirical evaluation in Section III reveals a common weakness of the existing defense methods a small learning rate and a small number of epochs in the fine-tuning stage are required to guarantee their effectiveness. This requirement can be detrimental to downstream tasks's performance because some fine-tuning tasks require a larger learning rate and longer training epochs to guarantee learning performance.\nTo this end, we in this paper aim to answer the following research question:\nIs there a safety alignment that can be insensitive to the hyper-parameters for the fine-tuning stage?"}, {"title": "Related work", "content": "Safety alignment. Safety alignment is about how to align a large language model such that its outputs are aligned with hu-mans' values. Representative techniques are RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) and its variants (Dai et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2023; Dong et al. 2023; Rafailov et al. 2023; Yuan et al. 2023). Most recently, there are alternative solutions focusing on augmenting the alignment data, e.g., (Liu, Sfer-razza, and Abbeel 2023; Liu et al. 2023; Ye et al. 2023).\nHarmful fine-tuning. (Qi et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023; Zhan et al. 2023) show that LLMs aligned by RLHF or SFT (su-pervised fine-tuning) can be jail-broken after fine-tuning on explicit/implicit harmful data, and several mechanism studies (Leong et al. 2024; Wei et al. 2024; Peng et al. 2024; Jain et al. 2024) are conducted to analyze the problem. Existing solutions for harmful fine-tuning issues can be categorized into two main categories. The first category is alignment stage solutions, which study how to improve the model's immunization ability to the fine-tuning by modifying train-ing procedure in alignment stage. Exemplar literature are Vaccine (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024) and RepNoise (Rosati et al. 2024b,a). Specifically, Vaccine vaccinates the model by adding embedding perturbation in the alignment stage, and RepNoise improve the robustness by enforcing the rep-resentation of the harmful data to be a random Gaussian noise. A concurrent research (Tamirisa et al. 2024) utilize meta learning to immunize the model. The second category is fine-tuning-stage solutions (Mukhoti et al. 2023; Zong et al. 2024; Huang et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024; Lyu et al. 2024)., which study how to avoid forgetting the alignment knowledge while also learning the fine-tuning knowledge by modifying training procedure in user fine-tuning stage. Specifically, LD-IFS (Mukhoti et al. 2023) introduces a regularizer to enforce the iterate's embedding to be in close proximity to that of the aligned model. VLGuard(Zong et al. 2024) mixes the alignment data with the user data to train in the user fine-tuning stage. Lisa(Huang et al. 2024) alternatively optimizes over the alignment data and the user fine-tuning data and use proximal regularizer to enforce proximity between iterates. Recently, there are also more advanced attack (He, Xia, and Henderson 2024; Halawi et al. 2024) in this setting.\nModel sparsification. Since (Frankle and Carbin 2018), model sparsification for deep learning models has been exten-sively studied. The core research problem for model sparsity literature is to score the weights coordinates according to their importance. The coordinates with small importance score are then removed to compress the model. Specifically for large language model, (Frantar and Alistarh 2023) propose SparseGPT, which forms the importance score by solving a layer-wise reconstruction problem. (Sun et al. 2023) propose Wanda score, which utilize joint weights/activation metrics to measure the coordinate importance. On top of Wanda, (Yin et al. 2023) propose layer-wise sparsity, which further im-prove the model compression ratio. We in this paper borrow importance score from the model sparsification literature to identify and remove harmful parameters.\nWe acknowledge that there are a few concurrent post-fine-tuning stage defenses, which also aim at purifying the model after fine-tuning completes. For example, (Hsu et al. 2024) project the harmful gradient updates to a aligned subspace. (Yi et al. 2024) realign model via subspace-oriented model fusion. (Tong et al. 2024) realign by self-contrastive decod-ing. It is possible that these existing solutions can also be insensitive the training hyper-parameters in fine-tuning stage due to the good nature of post-fine-tuning solutions. However, prior to this study, there is no systematical study on the hyper-parameter sensitivity issue, which highlights the significance of post-fine-tuning stage defense."}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "A typical fine-tuning-as-a-service pipeline. is considered in (Qi et al. 2023), where the users upload a few fine-tuning data to the service provider. On behalf of users, the service provider fine-tunes the aligned pre-trained model on this dataset, and the finetuned model is deployed by the service provider to deliver personalized service. Because the model is deployed in the service provider's server and the answer to user prompts is delivered by the service provider's API, the service provider has an obligation to ensure the an-swer is harmless. Otherwise, the service provider might face governance issues (Reuel et al. 2024) or lawsuit 1.\nFollowing (Rosati et al. 2024a; Tamirisa et al. 2024), we assume the service provider hosts a harmful dataset Drealign (containing harmful prompt-harmful answer pairs), which we use to perform post-fine-tuning stage re-alignment. We henceforth refer to this dataset as re-alignment dataset for clearness. Following (Rosati et al. 2024a; Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024; Hsu et al. 2024; Zong et al. 2024), we assume the service provider maintains a safety alignment dataset Dalign (containing harmful prompt-safe answer pairs)."}, {"title": "Revisiting Existing Defenses", "content": "In this subsection, we evaluate the existing safety alignment for harmful fine-tuning issue. We choose two representative alignment-stage solutions (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024; Rosati et al. 2024a) and two fine-tuning-stage solutions (Huang et al. 2024; Mukhoti et al. 2023) as demonstration.\nExisting defenses fail with a large learning rate in fine-tuning stage. We adjust the learning rate in the user fine-tuning stage and show how existing methods perform in Figure 2. Our results show that both alignment-stage defenses (Vaccine and RepNoise) and fine-tuning-stage defenses (Lisa and LDIFS) tend to have larger harmful scores when learning rate is large. We now explain the reason for their failures. i) For alignment stage solutions, the core idea of defense is to strengthen the aligned model's robustness towards harmful data in the later fine-tuning stage. The reason for a degraded performance is that a larger learning rate in fine-tuning stage can make it easier to subvert the model robustness induced before fine-tuning (the same phenomenon and explanation are given in (Rosati et al. 2024a)). ii) For fine-tuning stage defenses, the core idea is to introduce a regularizer in the fine-tuning stage to enforce the fine-tuning iterate in proximity to the aligned model. These solutions also suffer degraded performance because a larger learning rate may drift the iterates far away from the aligned model, resulting in the model failing to converge near the aligned model.\nExisting defenses fail with a large number of fine-tuning epochs. We adjust the number of fine-tuning epochs in the user fine-tuning stage and show the results in Table 3. Similar to the learning rate, a larger number of fine-tuning epochs tends to enlarge the harmful score and break the defense.\nThe reasons for their failure are similar to that induced by the large learning rate, i.e., i) strengthened alignment can still be jail-broken with more training epochs, and ii) More fine-tuning epochs induce more drift towards the aligned iterate.\nA sufficiently large learning rate and finetune epochs are necessary. However, as shown in Table 2 and 4, a sufficiently large learning rate is necessary to guarantee good fine-tune accuracy, which indicates that state-of-the-art solutions fall short and need renovation.\nWe refer to the common weakness of these defenses as hyper-parameter sensitivity issue, which restricts the general usage of the alignment solutions."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In order to counter the hyper-parameters sensitivity issue in fine-tuning stage, we propose a post-fine-tuning safety alignment that remains agnostic to the exact training setting in fine-tuning. The high-level idea is to remove the harmful parameters in the model after the model has corrupted with fine-tuning. The method is agnostic to the hyper-parameter in fine-tuning stage because in principle the harmful parameters can anyway be deactivated regardless of how they form in the fine-tuning stage. We refer to Figure 4 for a system overview.\nTo achieve the defense goal, we first need to identify the important parameters over a particular dataset using Wanda score. The Wanda score (Sun et al. 2023) measures the importance score of parameters given a dataset D, as follows:\n$[h(w, D)]_j = \\frac{1}{\\vert D \\vert} \\sum_{X\\in D} \\vert \\vert w_j \\vert \\vert . \\vert X_j \\vert \\vert$\nwhere $[;]_j$ retrieve the j-th element of the vector, $X_j$ is the input (or activation) associated with the j-th weight coordinate, and X represents a data point in a given dataset D.\nTo recognize the harmful parameters, one intuitive idea is to extract the topk most important mask (harmful mask) on the re-alignment dataset, indicating the most important parameters for harmful content generation, as follows.\nm = ArgTopKa (h(\u0175, Drealign))\nGiven the harmful mask m and the weights after fine-tuning w, The pruning operation is as follows:\nw = (1 \u2013 m) \u2299 w\nwhere w is the re-aligned model that is ready for deployment.\nIn summary, at stage I, we align the model on the alignment dataset using a vanilla SFT solution. At stage II, we finetune the model on the user fine-tuning dataset with SFT, and obtain the harmful mask, which captures the important parameters for harmful data. Finally, at the post-fine-tuning stage, we apply the pruning mask to the model and recover it from the harmful behavior. See Algorithm 1 for full procedure."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Model and Datasets. We use three mainstream pre-trained models, i.e., Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B for eval-uations. In the default setting, we use Llama2-7B as the back-bone. We consider three datasets associated with harmful data. The first dataset is an alignment dataset, which contains alignment data (i.e., data paired with harmful prompt-safe answers). The second is fine-tuning the dataset. This dataset is mixed with p (percentage) of harmful data (paired with harmful prompt-harmful answer) and 1 - p(percentage) of downstream data (e.g., SST2, GSM8K, etc). The last one is a re-alignment dataset, which is solely constituted by harm-ful data. The alignment data are sampled from BeaverTails (Ji et al. 2023) with the label is_safe=True. The harmful data in fine-tuning dataset and realignment are also sampled from BeaverTails (Ji et al. 2023) with is_safe=False, but the harmful data in those two datasets are different. For fine-tuning tasks, we consider four different datasets, i.e., SST2, AGNEWS, GSM8K and AlpacaEval. We discuss how to integrate and evaluate these tasks in supplementary materials.\nMetrics. Following (Huang et al. 2024), we use two metrics for evaluation.\n\u2022 Finetune Accuracy (FA). It is Top-1 accuracy of the model over the fine-tuning task's test dataset.\n\u2022 Harmful Score (HS). We use the moderation model from (Ji et al. 2023) to flag the model output given unseen mali-cious instructions. Harmful score is the ratio of the flagged unsafe output.\nTo calculate the harmful score, we sample 1000 harmful instructions from BeaverTails (Ji et al. 2023). To calculate finetune accuracy, we sample 872, 1000, 1000, and 122 sam-ples from the corresponding fine-tuning testing dataset.\nBaselines. We mainly consider five baselines in evaluation. SFT is utilized to supervised fine-tuning on both the align-ment and fine-tuning stages. Two representative alignment-stage solutions, i.e., Vaccine (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024) and RepNoise (Rosati et al. 2024a) modify the alignment stage while keeping the fine-tuning stage optimization as SFT. Two representative fine-tuning-stage solutions, i.e., Lisa(Huang et al. 2024) and LDIFS (Mukhoti et al. 2023) modify the fine-tuning stage while keeping the alignment stage optimization as SFT.\nTraining Details and Hyper-parameters. We follow (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024) to utilize LoRA (Hu et al. 2021) for alignment and fine-tuning. The rank of the adaptor is 256 for both tasks. For alignment, we use 5000 safety samples and an AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of le-3. We train the alignment data for 20 epochs. For fine-tuning, we use n samples, among which p (percentage) of samples are harmful data, an AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of lr is used, and we train for ep epochs. The default setting is n = 5000, p = 0.2, lr = le-4 and ep = 20, and the default dataset is SST2 unless otherwise specified. For hyper-parameters for Antidote, in default, we set the mask ratio to be a = 0.2 (specially, a = 0.05 for GSM8K) and we sam-ple 2000 harmful samples to form the re-alignment dataset used by Antidote. See for a setting for hyper-parameters for baselines. All experiments are done with an H100.\nMain Results\nRobustness to harmful ratio. We show in Table 1 how different methods perform when different ratios of harmful data are mixed into the fine-tuning data. Our results indicate that Antidote is able to achieve the lowest harmful score in most settings harmful ratio \u2013 it achieves a remarkable 11.56% reduction of average harmful score compared to SFT with a marginal 1.45% loss of average finetune accuracy. It is also notable that Antidote is able to achieve consistently good defense performance with no clear trend of performance degradation when the harmful ratio is high. In contrast, all the other methods tend to lose effectiveness when the harmful ratio is high (for example, Lisa has an 11.2% increase of harmful score from p = 0.05 to p = 0.5). The advantage of Antidote comes from the post-fine-tuning design, which remains agnostic of how different ratios of harmful data originally aligned model, and is not sensitive to how the model is going to drift from the aligned model produced by the previous alignment stage. Of note, the two alignment stage solutions do not seem to work well in all the settings. We will delay the analysis of their failure in the later learning rate experiment.\nRobustness to fine-tuning samples. We show in Table 2 how different fine-tuning samples used in the fine-tuning stage will affect the practical defense performance. Our results indicate Antidote again achieves the best defense performance among the baselines with a remarkable 13.42% reduction of the harmful score. Antidote is again the only defense that is universally robust to different sample number settings.\nRobustness to learning rate in fine-tuning. In Table 3, we adjust the learning rate in the fine-tuning stage to see its impact on defense performance. We use GSM8K for this evaluation to provide more diversified statistical data. Our results show that Antidote reduces 6.56% average harmful score with a marginal 0.38% average finetune accuracy drop. Although the harmful score reduction is less competitive compared to two fine-tuning-stage defenses Lisa and LD-IFS (which respectively achieve 7.72% and 9.50% harmful score reduction), we note that their performance gain comes with a drastic reduction of finetune accuracy. Moreover, the result when lr = le - 3 also coincides with the finding in our motivation section, that both Lisa and LDIFS suffer from hyper-parameter sensitivity. In contrast, Antidote is less susceptible to the exact setting of learning rate.\nRobustness to training epochs in fine-tuning. In Table 4, we adjust the number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage to see its impact on the defense performance. GSM8K is used for this evaluation to provide more diversified statistical data. The results show that while other defenses tend to have a larger harmful score when fine-tuning epochs are larger, this is not obvious for Antidote (specifically, harmful score is 6.3% lower for Antidote from ep = 10 to ep = 40). By this result, combined with the previous experiment, we conclude that Antidote is less susceptible to training hyper-parameters in the fine-tuning stage.\nGeneralizations to datasets. In Table 5, we show the evalu-ation results for different datasets. Our results confirm that Antidote can be generalized to different fine-tuning tasks. On average, we show that Antidote reduce the harmful score by 11.75% with 3.08% of finetune accuracy loss. Here we did not specifically tune the mask ratio a for each dataset, and we will discuss later that the tradeoff between harm-ful score and finetune accuracy can be adjusted by this key hyper-parameter.\nGeneralizations to models. We show in Table 6 how differ-ent methods perform on different LLMs. Our results indicate that Antidote can be generalized to different model archi-tectures. For Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B, An-tidote respectively achieve 11.6%, 20.0%, 22.5% reduction of harmful score with a minor reduction of 1.49%, 0.92%, and 1.72% finetune accuracy. Particularly, in terms of fine-tune accuracy, our results coincide with the bench-marking results that the rank of language ability of three models is Gemma-7B>Mistral-7B>Llama2-7B. In terms of reducing harmful score, our results seem to indicate that Antidote is more effective when the backbone model is stronger."}, {"title": "Statistical and System Evaluation", "content": "Harmful embedding drift. To justify the reason why Anti-dote is able to recover the model even with a large learning rate and training epoch, we follow (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024) to measure the harmful embedding drift (HED), which tracks the L2 norm of the difference between the hidden embedding of the aligned model and that of the finetuned model over the same alignment data. We show in Figure 5 how differ-ent learning rates and training epochs affect this statistic. As shown, Antidote maintains the HED on a small scale, while the HED of other mitigation strategies escalates with the growth of learning rate and training epochs. Particularly, note that Antidote and SFT share the same two identical processes (and therefore the same HED) in their first two stages, but after the one-shot pruning in the post-fine-tuning stage, the HED of Antidote is significantly lower. This justifies that pruning out the identified harmful parameters can indeed recover the alignment knowledge preserved in the model.\nIn summary, our finding justifies that Antidote can min-imize the hidden embedding drift over the alignment data by pruning some specific harmful coordinates, and thereby mitigating the harmful embedding drift issue mentioned in (Huang, Hu, and Liu 2024).\nSystem performance. We then measure the system perfor-mance (i.e., clock time, GPU memory usage) of different solutions in Table 7. Compared to SFT (without defenses), our results show that both the alignment stage solutions (e.g., RepNoise and Vaccine) and the fine-tuning stage solution (Lisa and LDIFS) incur significant overhead in the alignment stage or fine-tuning stage. For example, Vaccine and Rep-Noise require over 2x clock time for alignment. and over 1.7x GPU memory consumption. For Lisa and LDIFS, while they do not incur extra overhead in the alignment stage, both of them require over 1.6x GPU memory, and LDIFS requires 1.5x clock time in the fine-tuning stage. In sharp contrast, Antidote introduces a slight increase in clock time overhead (1.02x clock time) and the same GPU memory usage for the whole pipeline. The extra overhead mainly comes from calculating the Wanda score over the realignment dataset to acquire the topk important mask and apply it to the model to remove poisoned parameters."}, {"title": "Hyper-parameters Analysis and Ablation Study", "content": "Impact of mask ratio a. We next show how Antidote per-forms given different mask ratios as its hyper-parameter in Table 8. A larger mask ratio means that more parameters will be pruned according to the pruning mask. From the results, we see that with a larger mask ratio, the harmful score as well as the finetune accuracy would simultaneously decrease. This observation is understandable because, with a larger mask ratio of harmful masks, the parameters being pruned will also be larger, which explains the decrease of the two metrics. Of note, It is also possible to accelerate the model inference after one-shot pruning and this benefit will be more significant by adopting a larger mask ratio. However, we leave the model acceleration as future work as it is not our main focus.\nNecessity of re-alignment dataset. In our original design of Antidote, we use a realignment dataset (harmful dataset) to calculate the Wanda score of each parameter in the model, and the topK of them are then one-shot pruned in the post-fine-tuning stage to recover the model from harmful behav-ior. In Table 9, we show how the defense performance will become by replacing the realignment dataset with the fine-tuning dataset or benign dataset (fine-tuning dataset after precluding harmful data). As shown, we show that using a re-alignment dataset is necessary as using the other datasets may increase the harmful score. Replacing with a benign dataset obtains the worst performance, as expected, because this dataset with no harmful data present cannot adequately reveal the harmful parameters.\nImpact of the size of realignment dataset. Per Eq. (1), we calculate the harmful Wanda score with the average statistics over the realignment dataset (harmful dataset). It is interest-ing to see how different numbers of harmful samples included in the re-alignment dataset can affect defense performance. Our results in Table 10 show that the general trend is that a larger number of harmful samples are preferable in terms of reducing harmful score. This is understandable because a larger number of harmful samples can better reflect the real harmful distribution therefore resulting in a more precise identification of harmful parameters. Another finding is that 1k samples of harmful data seem to be performing well, and the benefit of further increasing the sample number dimin-ishes. As collecting 1k harmful samples is not too restrictive\u00b2, this experiment validates the feasibility of Antidote.\nAs Antidote is a post-fine-tuning stage solution, it is interest-ing to study the performance of Antidote combined with an alignment stage solution or a fine-tuning stage solution (or both). We first present three extensions as follows:\n\u2460V-S-A: Vaccine (alignment) + SFT (FT) +Antidote\n\u2461S-L-A: SFT (alignment) + Lisa (FT) +Antidote\n\u2462V-L-A: Vaccine (alignment) + Lisa (FT) +Antidote\nAs shown in Table 11, our result shows that V-S-A reduces the average harmful score by 2.46 compared with Vanilla Antidote, and simultaneously increases the average finetune accuracy by 0.19. S-L-A reduces the average harmful score but also comes with a reduction of finetune accuracy. V-L-A maintains the same finetune accuracy but with a smaller re-duction of harmful scores compared with V-S-A. In summary, here is the doctor's advice: Be Vaccinated (Vaccine), don't be Lazy (Lisa), and take Antidote if feeling unwell."}, {"title": "Visualization", "content": "As follows, we show how different methods respond to a malicious prompt.

Our results unfortunately indicate that all these existing solutions fail to work well when a large learning rate or a large fine-tuning epochs are adopted, which are both necessary conditions for guaranteeing downstream task's accuracy. To remedy this issue, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage defense that is agnostic to the training details in fine-tuning stage. The core philosophy is that by removing the harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful behaviors, regardless of how those harmful parameters are formed in the fine-tuning stage.

For SST2, AGNEWS, and GSM8K, we measure the finetune accuracy by counting the correct samples out of all the testing samples. A sample is counted as correct for SST2 and AGNEWS if the model gives the correct classifi-cation answer.

Here is the detailed implementation of the five baselines.\n\u2022 SFT. For SFT, we use the vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the alignment dataset to align the pre-train model. Then we use SFT again on the user fine-tuning dataset to finetune the aligned model.\n\u2022 Vaccine (alignment-stage solution).

For RepNoise (Rosati et al. 2024a), we use RepNoise to align the pre-trained model on the alignment dataset/harmful dataset.

For LDIFS (Mukhoti et al. 2023), we use SFT to align the pre-trained model on the alignment dataset. Then we use LDIFS to finetune the model on user data to adapt to the corresponding task.\nFor Vaccine, we pick the perturbation intensity p = 2, which is the default hyper-parameter in their paper. For Rep-Noise, we utilize a = 0.1 and 3 = 0.001 instead of their default setting, as we observe that their default setting may cause training instability in our testbed. For Lisa, we uti-lize the default proximal penalty p = 1. For LDIFS, we tune the regularization coefficient \u5165 0.0001 from the set [0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00"}}}]}

Despite this wealth of data, there exists an untapped potential for leveraging artificial intelligence based technological systems to benefit Indian fishermen in coastal areas. To fill this void in the Indian technology ecosystem, the authors introduce Jal Anveshak. This is an application framework written in Dart and Flutter that uses a Llama 2 based Large Language Model fine-tuned on pre-processed and augmented government data related to fishing yield and availability. Its main purpose is to help Indian fishermen safely get the maximum yield of fish from coastal areas and to resolve their fishing related queries in multilingual and multimodal ways.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs) is a unique service provided by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), that combines the efforts of oceanographers, remote sensing/GIS experts, and marine biologists. They are issued three times a week by INCOIS by incorporating the data on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll retrieved regularly from NOAA-AVHRR (USA), Eumetsat (ESA) Met-Op series satellites along with Oceansat-II (India) and MODIS Aqua (USA) satellites.\nShailesh Nayak et al. in a 2002 paper regarding the satellite based PFZ advisory service, highlight the socioeconomic benefits gained using the service. They estimated a saving of about Rs. 545 crores from the ten percent of boat owners that used the advisories in the same year as well as a predicted growth of Rs.1635 crores from about 25 percent of saving and boat owners respectively. These predictions indicate that the PFZ advisory serves to benefit the fishery industry as a whole, by saving the costs incurred by the fishermen for fuel as well as increasing the catch per unit effort. The data provided also gives information about the relative location of given ports albeit the ports keep changing as well as the data is difficult to understand for smaller fishermen. Another part missing from the PFZ data is the availability of location specific data as they only provide the name of ports, and a general latitude and longitude.\nThis research focuses on improving these advisories, by parsing the INCOIS data in a mobile app named \u201cJal Anveshak\" and making it more interactive as well as providing location specific information to the fishmongers. In this app, a pre-trained and fine-tuned LLM is used to help navigate the fisherman to the nearest predicted fishing spot according to that day's data. The answer can be represented in either textual instructions or a GIS representation extracted from the model. By providing an easy to understand lower level abstraction of the entire data based on the location of the fisherman as well as their needs. This will help increase the usage of the data as from the current estimate of 25 percent as a raw data file fails to provide the layman with important data regarding fishing zones."}, {"title": "Nomenclature", "content": "INCOIS Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services\nPFZ Potential Fishing Zones\nSST Sea Surface Temperature"}, {"title": "2. Literature Review", "content": "Kumar, T. & Masuluri, Nagaraja & Nayak, Shailesh. (2008) developed a model using sea surface temperature gradient, gradient persistence, and chlorophyll levels to characterize potential fishing zones by expected catch. Our app integrates a similar predictive capability, aiding fishermen in planning trips and managing expectations. This methodology enhances our fishing zone identification services, validated by the referenced paper.\nDwivedi, R.M. et al. (2005) demonstrate satellite data techniques for identifying potential fishing zones, with a high success rate in predicting productive areas and increased catch. Integrating satellite-based forecasts into our app provides valuable input for fishermen, improving benefit-cost ratios, as noted in the paper.\nIn their paper, Dwi Ely Kurniawan, Afdhol Dzikri, and Nanna Suryana Herman stress the importance of a tailored mobile app for fishermen to enhance catch marketing and sales. They recommend SMS gateway integration and consider infrastructure constraints for fishing zone identification. Incorporating user feedback and prototyping adjustments could enhance app effectiveness.\nAkanmu Semiu Ayobami and Wan Rozaini Sheikh Osman in their paper offer insights into fishermen's essential app needs like weather updates and pricing information. They advocate participatory design involving fishermen, informing app development to meet genuine user needs.\nJulia Calderwood in her paper reviews smartphone apps in commercial fisheries, stressing their role in data collection, including catch data for fishing zones. Co-design with fishermen is crucial for usability. Involving them ensures meeting needs, informing our app development.\nChristian Skov, Kieran Hyder and Casper Gundelund in their paper highlight fishing apps as valuable tools for data collection, offering detailed spatiotemporal fishing behavior data.\nT.M. Balakrishna Nair, K.Srinivas, M. Nagarajakumar and Dr. R. Harikumar underscore the advancements made by INCOIS in utilizing satellite observation systems to disseminate marine fishery advisories and potential fishing zone information.

Framework structure", "content": "The application framework Jal Anveshak first asks the user (presumably, a fisherman) to choose a language from a dropdown in which they want the application to be in (See Fig. 1). All the internal text of the website from this point thereon is in the chosen language, which can be later changed internally in the settings if required (See Fig. 2)."}, {"title": "4.3. NLP Methodology", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise as intelligent AI helpers that can handle difficult thinking tasks in a variety of fields. Because these models allow for conversational interfaces that are easy to use, the general public has embraced them quickly and extensively and that is the exact reason why we decided to incorporate a large language model in our app.\nTo improve the Llama 2 model on the fishing domain, we created a dataset with 10,000 entries. The monthly data was gathered on a daily basis, and each day's data was matched with a pre-established set of questions and their corresponding responses. The dataset was painstakingly assembled. The Llama tokenizer was used to tokenize the data, guaranteeing that it was correctly encoded for additional processing, in order to get the dataset ready for model training. The dataset was tokenized and then entered into the module known as SFTTrainer, or Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer. This module made the process of fine-tuning easier, enabling the model to efficiently learn from the encoded dataset. Under supervised conditions, the model's performance was fine-tuned to maximize its effectiveness on the given task.\nThe purpose of this fine-tuned chatbot was to make the data more accessible to the fishermen, improve doubt resolution capabilities and enhance user friendliness. For example, the model can answer the question \u201cWhere should I go to catch Rohu fish today?\" with accurate detail through text and markers in interactive maps nearest to the fisherman's location (See Fig. 4)."}, {"title": "5. Future Work", "content": "The proposed work could have future enhancements by implementing analysis of satellite images and breed specific fish data in order to better suit the needs of fishermen. Additionally, making the app accessible without network connectivity would provide better offline support to offshore fishermen. Further, involving the necessary government agencies, will help in promoting the product and in its recognition. With the help of the government, the app will be made official, hence reaching to the target audience, i.e. the fishermen."}]}

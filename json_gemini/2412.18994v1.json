INTRODUCTION", "content": "This paper explores the vital importance of urban mapping in modern city planning and smart city infrastructure development [1]. As urban areas expand, planners face significant challenges in managing complex environments, making accurate urban maps essential for transportation planning, disaster management, infrastructure development, and environmental monitoring [2]. Traditional urban mapping relies on single-sensor geospatial data sources, such as Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery, each offering unique advantages [3],[4]. Lidar provides high-resolution 3D data, SAR captures surface texture and elevation even under adverse conditions, and optical imagery offers valuable visual and spectral data, albeit limited by weather [5],[6]. However, relying on a single sensor can result in incomplete feature extraction, highlighting the need for geospatial data fusion. By integrating Lidar, SAR, and optical imagery, urban mapping systems can create a more comprehensive dataset, enhancing feature extraction accuracy [7], [8], [9]. Advanced computational techniques, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning, are necessary for processing this fused data [10]. The paper highlights the use of Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for automated urban feature extraction, improving mapping efficiency. To optimize FCN performance, the study employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to automate hyperparameter tuning, addressing the challenges of manual tuning and enhancing model accuracy [11].\nRecent research highlights significant advancements in the use of Al and deep learning for geospatial data analysis.

These studies collectively demonstrate the increasing reliance on Al, particularly deep learning and XAI, to solve complex problems in geospatial analysis, maritime surveillance, urban services, and financial crime detection.\nThe objective of this paper is to build upon existing work by developing a unified framework for urban mapping that integrates Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery. This framework leverages Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) for feature extraction and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for model optimization. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) it presents a comprehensive data fusion framework for urban mapping; (2) it applies a state-of-the-art deep learning model (FCNs) to extract urban features from the fused geospatial data; and (3) it introduces robust optimization techniques (PSO) to fine-tune the deep learning model for optimal performance [23]. This approach aims to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of urban mapping systems, making it a valuable tool for modern smart city infrastructure development."}, {"title": "II. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "Urban mapping is essential for city planning, infrastructure development, and smart city management. However, relying on single-sensor data sources such as Lidar, SAR, or optical imagery-presents significant limitations, as each sensor captures specific types of information, leading to incomplete or inaccurate urban feature extraction [24]. For instance, Lidar excels in capturing building heights but lacks detail in surface textures, while SAR effectively represents surface roughness but may not accurately depict complex structures. Environmental factors like cloud cover can hinder the effectiveness of optical imagery. Given the complexity and diversity of urban environments, a multi-modal data approach that integrates Lidar, SAR, and optical imagery is necessary. This data fusion enhances urban feature representation by combining the strengths of each data type, resulting in a comprehensive dataset that includes building heights from Lidar, surface textures from SAR, and visual characteristics from optical imagery. To analyze these high-resolution fused datasets, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) are utilized for automated feature extraction, minimizing the need for manual identification of urban elements such as buildings and roads [25]. However, optimizing AI models is critical, as manual hyperparameter tuning can lead to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to automate the tuning process, enhancing the performance of the FCN model on complex datasets. The fused geospatial dataset can be represented as D = {DL, DSAR, Do} (Lidar, SAR, and optical imagery), which must undergo preprocessing to align spatially and temporally without losing important features [26]. The FCN learns a mapping function $F_{\\theta}(D)$ with learnable parameters $\\theta$ and aims to minimize a loss function $L(F_{\\theta}(D), Y )$, where Y represents the ground truth urban features. Achieving efficient convergence necessitates robust optimization strategies, regularization techniques, and hyper-parameter optimization to ensure that the model generalizes well to new urban environments. PSO helps find the global optimum by simulating a swarm of particles that iteratively improve their positions in the search space, ultimately converging on the best hyperparameter values to balance accuracy and generalization."}, {"title": "A.

Skip connections are employed to retain detailed information during upsampling, improving segmentation accuracy. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotations and flips) applied to improve generalization. The model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function to minimize the error between predicted and actual labels.\n1.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Hyperparameter Tuning", "content": "To optimize the hyperparameters of the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized. PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by bird flocking behavior. In this approach, each particle in the swarm represents a candidate solution, with its position corresponding to a specific set of FCN hyperparameters, such as learning rate, number of filters, and batch size [37]. The swarm is initialized randomly, and particles update their positions based on both individual and collective knowledge to minimize the FCN model's validation loss [38]. As the swarm converges, the optimal hyperparameters are identified. PSO's global search capability efficiently explores the hyperparameter space, providing advantages over traditional optimization methods like grid or random search.\n1.

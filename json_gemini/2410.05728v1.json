Specifically, attribute reduction theory in property-oriented and object-oriented concept lattices has been considered in order to present a mechanism for detecting redundant equations. As a first consequence, the computation of the whole solution set of a solvable FRE is reduced. Moreover, we will also introduce a novel method for computing approximate solutions of unsolvable FRE related to a (real) dataset with uncertainty/imprecision data.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Fuzzy relation equations (FRE) arise as an approximate reasoning tool for discerning the possible relations masked in a database, which is instrumental in real world problems, as Sanchez claimed in his seminal papers [42, 43]: \u201cHuman judgments are often based on comparisons between couples of faced data\". Lying their foundations in fuzzy set theory [46], FRE features as a powerful technique for handling databases containing uncertain and incomplete information.\nThe applications of FRE cover an ample range of fields as decision making [9, 23, 30], bipolarity [10, 11, 12, 25], image processing [1, 29, 32], fuzzy control [17, 18, 24], optimization [5, 28, 34] and abductive reasoning [21, 31]. Their large usage evince the necessity of solving FRE. Since their introduction, different authors started to study the resolution of FRE with generalized connectives [3, 16, 18, 39, 40, 44]. For example, we can find works"}, {"title": "2. Preliminaries", "content": "In this section, some preliminary notions and results related to FCA [26, 36] and FRE [18, 19, 20] will be recalled.\nAdjoint triples [14] are the basic operators that will be used throughout this paper, being a generalisation of left-continuous t-norms and its residuated implications.\nDefinition 1 ([14]). Let $(P_1, \\leq_1)$, $(P_2, \\leq_2)$, $(P_3, \\leq_3)$ be posets and $\\& : P_1 \\times P_2 \\rightarrow P_3$, $\\surd : P_3 \\times P_2 \\rightarrow P_1$, $\\vartriangleleft : P_3 \\times P_1 \\rightarrow P_2$ mappings, then $(\\&, \\surd, \\vartriangleleft)$ is called an adjoint triple with respect to $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ if\n$x \\& y \\leq_3 z $\\text{ iff } $\\&y \\leq_3 z $\\text{ iff } $y \\leq_2 x\\vartriangleleft z$\nfor each $x \\in P_1$, $y \\in P_2$, $z \\in P_3$.\nFollowing the multi-adjoint philosophy, the basic algebraic structure here will be a triplet of posets endowed with a set of adjoint triples. For computational reasons, we demand two of the posets to be lattices.\nDefinition 2 ([35]). Let $(L_1, \\leq_1)$, $(L_2, \\leq_2)$ be two lattices, $(P, \\leq)$ a poset and $\\{(\\&_i,\\surd_i,\\vartriangleleft_i) \\mid i \\in \\{1,...,n\\}\\}$ a set of adjoint triples with respect to $P, L_2, L_1$. The tuple\n$(L_1, L_2, P, \\leq_1, \\leq_2, <, \\&_1, \\surd_1, \\vartriangleleft_1,...,\\&_n,\\surd_n,\\vartriangleleft_n)$\nis called multi-adjoint property-oriented frame.\nTo improve readability, if $L_1 = L_2 = P$, the property-oriented multi-adjoint frame will be denoted as\n$(P, <, \\&_1, \\surd_1, \\vartriangleleft_1,...,\\&_n,\\surd_n, \\vartriangleleft_n)$\nThe reality under study is represented by the formal notion of context. Basically, a context consists of a set of objects, a set of attributes, a relation between them and a mapping that assigns (the index of) an adjoint triple to each pair attribute-object.\nDefinition 3 ([35]). Let $(L_1, L_2, P, \\leq_1, <_2, <, \\&_1, \\surd_1, \\vartriangleleft_1,...,\\&_n,\\surd_n,\\vartriangleleft_n)$ be a property-oriented multi-adjoint frame. A context is a tuple $(A, B, R, \\sigma)$ where A and B are non-empty sets, $R: A \\times B \\rightarrow P$ is a fuzzy relation and $\\sigma: A \\times B \\rightarrow \\{1, ..., n\\}$ is a mapping."}, {"title": "3. Multi-adjoint FRE reduction", "content": "The procedures given in the previous section enable to study the solvability of a multi-adjoint FRE and, in case it is solvable, to compute the whole solution set. In this section, we will study whether it is possible to simplify the number of equations of the systems associated with a FRE (System (8)), that is, whether redundant equations exist in a multi-adjoint FRE $R\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T$. As a consequence of this study, the computation of the whole solution set of a (multi-adjoint) FRE can be reduced. Namely, the number of operations needed for such computation can be too large in certain circumstances, what can be a problem when the database that is under study has a high number of elements. For example, lets fix a multi-adjoint frame\n$([0,1]^n, \\leq, \\&_1,\\surd_1, \\vartriangleleft_1, ..., \\&_n,\\surd_n,\\vartriangleleft_n)$\nwhere $[0, 1]_n$ denotes the regular partition of the unit interval in $n$ pieces. Consider the sets\n$U = \\{u_i \\mid i \\in \\{1, ..., m\\}\\}, V = \\{v_i \\mid i \\in \\{1, ...,m\\}\\}, W = \\{w\\}$\nand a solvable multi-adjoint FRE\n$R\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T$\nwhere $R\\in [0, 1]^{U\\times V}$, $T\\in [0,1]^{U\\times W}$ and $X \\in [0,1]^{V\\times W}$, being $X$ unknown. Notice that, by Corollary 12, it is easy to obtain the maximum solution of the equation. Nevertheless, the procedure for describing the whole solution set would require, in the worst case, computing the whole concept lattice"}, {"title": "4. Approximation of unsolvable multi-adjoint FRE", "content": "The results developed in Section 3 deal with the reduction of solvable FRE. In what follows, we will show how the reduction theory presented in this paper can be used to reduce an unsolvable FRE, i.e. to eliminate equations, so that it becomes solvable. In this case, we may reason that the eliminated equations correspond to incoherences in the data. Notice that, as it has been shown in Section 3, a MARE cannot be reduced in an arbitrary way if we want to preserve the information. Consistent sets and reducts will also play a key role in the reduction process in order to ensure that no information is being lost when approximating a MARE.\nGiven an unsolvable FRE\n$R\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T$\nassociated with the context $(U, V, R, \\sigma)$ and suppose that there exists a set $Y\\subset U$ such that the Y-reduced FRE\n$R_Y\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T_Y$\nis solvable. In that case, we may assert that the existing incoherences in FRE (16) have been eliminated when carrying out the reduction. Nevertheless, we might have removed more than needed. For example, the $\\emptyset$-reduced FRE is clearly solvable, since all equations of FRE (16) are eliminated, but then all information contained in FRE (16) has been deleted.\nWe will say that an equation is \u201cproblematic\" if removing it from an unsolvable MARE results in a solvable one, what means that unsolvability was induced by this equation. However, it only makes sense removing a problematic equation if it is not associated with an attribute in a reduct, i.e., if it contains redundant information in the coefficient matrix.\nTherefore, we are interested in removing the equations that are redundant and problematic in MARE (16), whilst preserving the rest of equations. To this aim, following the approach provided in Theorem 17, we will demand the ground set $Y$ to be a consistent set of $(U, V, R, \\sigma)$. Furthermore, in order to also remove redundant equations (in their left side), we will require $Y$ to be a reduct of $(U, V, R, \\sigma)$.\nDefinition 21. Let $R\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T$ be an unsolvable FRE and $(U, V, R, \\sigma)$ its associated context. A reduct $Y$ of $(U, V, R, \\sigma)$ is feasible if the Y-reduced FRE $R_Y\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T_Y$ is solvable."}, {"title": "5. Reduction and approximation in a dual multi-adjoint FRE", "content": "A dual equation can be developed if we consider the same composition $\\odot_{\\sigma}$ and the equality $R\\odot_{\\sigma} S = T$, where $R$ is the unknown fuzzy relation. This section will study and adapt the definitions and results given above to the equation $X\\odot_{\\sigma} S = T$.\nLet U, V, W be finite sets and $(L_1, L_2, P, \\&_1, . . ., \\&_n)$ a fixed multi-adjoint object-oriented frame [35].

The results proved in Section 3 and Section 4, that reduce and approximate equations of the form $R\\odot_{\\sigma} X = T$ can be adapted to this equation too. The main difference is in the notion of Y-reduced equation, which is given using object reduction instead of attribute reduction. Now, we will introduce the definition of reduced FRE with respect to an I-reduct."}, {"title": "6. Reducing and approximating a FRE with max-min composition", "content": "All the results that have been introduced in this paper have been developed under a multi-adjoint frame, which has been chosen because of its flexibility. However, the presented results are also applicable in the classical case of a max-min FRE, with just considering the unit interval and the G\u00f6del t-norm in the multi-adjoint frame, that is, considering the Heyting algebra ([0,1], $\\&_G$). We will denote as $\\odot_G$ the composition operator in which all variables are assigned to the G\u00f6del t-norm, that is, the max-min composition.\nThe first result that can be proved in this environment is the one related to the reduction of FRE.\nTheorem 30. Let $R\\odot_GX = T$ be a solvable FRE and Y a consistent set of (U,V, R). The Y-reduced FRE of $R\\odot_GX = T$ is solvable. Moreover, $X \\in L^{Y\\times W}$ is a solution of the Y-reduced FRE if and only if it is a solution of the complete FRE.\nProof. Particular case of Theorem 17.\nIn this case, it makes no sense considering a dual FRE, as the composition operator $\\odot_G$ is commutative.\nThe definition of feasible reduct can be naturally extended from Definition 21, as it is not affected by considering a residuated lattice.\nDefinition 31. Let $R\\odot_G X = T$ be an unsolvable FRE and (U, V, R) its associated context. A reduct $Y$ of (U, V, R) is feasible if the Y-reduced FRE $R_Y\\odot_G X = T_y$ is solvable.\nThe approximation of unsolvable FRE can also be naturally particularized to the max-min composition.\nTheorem 32. Let $R\\odot_GX = T$ be an unsolvable FRE and Y a feasible reduct of its associated context. There exists $T^* \\in L^{U\\times W}$ such that $R\\odot_GX = T^*$ is solvable and $R_Y \\odot_G X = T_Y$ is a Y-reduced FRE of $R \\odot_G X = T^*$. Additionally, $T^*(u, w) = (T_Y)\\uparrow\\downarrow (u)$, for all $(u,w) \\in U \\times W$.\nProof. Particular case of Theorem 23."}, {"title": "7. Conclusions and future work", "content": "Taking into consideration the existing relationship between FRE and concept lattices, this paper has applied for the first time attribute reduction theory, in the general frameworks of the multi-adjoint property-oriented concept lattices and object-oriented concept lattices, in order to simplify FRE, removing redundant equations and preserving the underlying information in the original/complete FRE. As a consequence, the computation of the whole solution set of a given FRE is reduced. Indeed, this advantage is even better when a set of FRE with the same coefficient matrix (such as in dynamic systems problems) must be solved.\nMoreover, the introduced FRE reduction method has been used to introduce a procedure for approximating FRE containing some incoherences and usual errors that could be present in real data, in which the existence of uncertainty and imprecision is natural.\nIn the future, coherence measures of unsolvable FRE will be studied, which can characterize the level of uncertainty and/or imprecision in the considered dataset. Moreover, the introduced approximation mechanism will be combined with the pessimistic and optimistic approaches [9] to be applied in real cases related to the COST Action DigForASP (dig-forasp.uca.es)."}]}

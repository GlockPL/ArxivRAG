INTRODUCTION", "content": "FEDERATED Learning (FL) has emerged as one of the promising platforms in collaboration with Artificial In-telligence (AI), especially when applied to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks [1]. With the core elements of FL, it can be applied to intelligent IIoT systems by facilitating AI training at the network edge. Incorporating FL into IIoT networks makes it possible to address scalability issues while also addressing concerns related to user privacy and the confidentiality of industrial data [2].\nThe integration of FL across diverse industries such as smart cities, healthcare, and transportation is revolutionizing data-sharing methods, attack detection, and privacy preserva-tion. These industries, closely linked with various Internet of Things (IoT) services, benefit from FL's ability to manage data efficiently and securely, as highlighted in Nguyen's study [3]. Particularly in IIoT network scenarios, which demand high throughput, low latency, and precise anomaly detection, FL's role becomes even more crucial. By incorporating deep reinforcement learning within an FL framework, FL-based anomaly detection techniques significantly reduce privacy risks, a concept validated in Wang's research [4].\nHowever, the challenge lies in integrating FL, IIoT, and trustworthiness on a single platform, especially within the IIoT context, which is a relatively unexplored area. The challenge is especially due to the tiny footprint of the IIoT devices to withhold the FL model, and subsequently ensure security and privacy for the devices and model. Addressing this, the chameleon hash method with a configurable trapdoor, as pro-posed in Wei's study [5], tackles vulnerabilities by employing FL for privacy-preserving data analysis in IIoT. This method has been effectively implemented in a redactable medical blockchain, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, Li's research introduces a multi-tentacle feder-ated learning (MTFL) architecture for the software-defined IIoT framework, comprising a stochastic tentacle data ex-changing (STDE) protocol and an efficient poisoning attack detection algorithm [6]. These innovations collectively mark significant advancements in the field.\nFurthermore, federated cybersecurity, a decentralized ap-proach through FL, plays a pivotal role in identifying and mit-igating security threats in the IIoT, as discussed in Ghimire's study [7]. FederatedTrust, for instance, ensures reliable FL models by employing thirty metrics and six pillars to evaluate trustworthiness in IoT and edge computing, as noted by Sanchez [8]. This underscores its practical application in IoT security, particularly in smart industries. Despite these devel-opments, the existing literature on trustworthy FL, especially in IIoT, remains limited, lacking a forward-looking vision for the potential, enabling technologies, challenges, and various design aspects of employing FL in IIoT networks.\nThe research questions tackled in this paper are outlined as follows:\n\u2022\tHow to achieve a balance between interpretability and robustness in FL systems within the IIoT, ensuring both transparency for trust and compliance, and resilience against diverse industrial challenges."}, {"title": "II. RESPONSIBLE AND ROBUST FEDERATED LEARNING", "content": "FL has emerged as a crucial technology, enabling decentral-ized machine learning while addressing key issues like com-munication efficiency, data privacy, and model accuracy. This is particularly relevant in IIoT, where devices often operate in resource-constrained environments, and the integrity and confidentiality of data are paramount. Recent advancements in FL for IIoT focus on optimizing communication efficiency, data privacy, and model accuracy [9].\nTo strengthen the model's robustness against possible at-tacks, \"adversarial training\" entails supplementing training data with adversarial instances that are designed to trick the model. Adversarial training strengthens FL models against malevolent actors trying to impact model integrity in the setting of IIoT, where security risks are common. On the other hand, the term \u201cbyzantine-resistant aggregation\u201d de-scribes methods used in the FL process to reduce the impact of attacks. Byzantine-resistant aggregation guarantees that malicious nodes do not disrupt the collaborative learning process in IIoT settings, where data integrity is crucial.

DESIGN METHODOLOGIES FOR CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS", "content": "Designing robust and efficient systems for challenging envi-ronments, particularly in industrial settings, is a complex task that requires innovative and resilient methodologies. This is particularly true when implementing FL in the context of the Industrial IoT and manufacturing processes.\nThe reliability and performance of FL are put to the test in high-temperature IIoT environments, such as steel manufacturing or chemical processing plants. According to Gaddam et al. [10], high temperatures can impact hardware performance and data transmission, which can disrupt learning processes. To address these challenges, it is crucial for design methodologies to prioritize the development of hardware and software that can effectively withstand extreme temperatures. This involves the utilization of heat-resistant materials in the construction of devices, as well as the implementation of ad-vanced cooling technologies. On the software side, optimizing algorithms for efficient data processing is crucial to minimize the duration the hardware is exposed to high temperatures. Furthermore, by implementing robust data synchronization methods, it is possible to ensure consistent performance of FL even when there are thermal fluctuations.\nIn FL for IIoT, decentralization improves dependability by lowering reliance on single points of failure, encourag-ing redundancy, and lowering data loss risks. Decentralized techniques enhance system resilience, privacy, and security by decreasing vulnerability to centralized weaknesses and aggregating insights locally, notwithstanding the constraints associated with gathering data from remote sources.\nIn environments where corrosive substances are prevalent, such as in certain types of chemical manufacturing, traditional computing, and IoT devices can degrade quickly, hindering the effectiveness of FL [11]. To address this, design method-ologies must include the use of corrosion-resistant materials in device fabrication. Coatings and seals that can withstand harsh chemicals are essential for protecting the devices' inter-nal and external components. From a software perspective, strategies such as redundant data paths and error-checking mechanisms can help maintain data integrity in these harsh conditions. Furthermore, predictive maintenance algorithms integrated into the FL system can preemptively identify and address potential issues caused by corrosive elements, thereby reducing downtime and maintaining steady performance.\nIn both high-temperature and corrosive environments, the key is to develop FL systems that are resilient to physical challenges and capable of adapting to environmental changes. This involves a continuous cycle of monitoring, learning, and adapting, where the FL system evolves to maintain optimal performance. Such deterministic approaches in the design of FL systems are crucial for their successful deployment and operation in challenging industrial environments."}, {"title": "A.

Incorporating adversarial robustness techniques like adversar-ial training and anomaly detection, integrating robust privacy-preserving mechanisms like FL with encryption or differential privacy, and supporting real-time adaptation through online learning and adaptive FL algorithms are also necessary. Fur-thermore, the design demands lightweight model architectures and edge computing solutions.

These models"}, {"title": "D. Adaptive Hybrid Approaches", "content": "The dynamic design fusion in FL involves combining the predictability of deterministic models with the flexibility of probabilistic approaches. Deterministic models provide a solid foundation, offering predictable outcomes under specific con-ditions, which is vital for ensuring baseline performance and reliability [9]. On the other hand, probabilistic models excel in handling uncertainties and variabilities inherent in IIoT environments, like fluctuating network conditions or variable data quality. By integrating these approaches, FL systems can maintain stable operation while dynamically adapting to changing environmental factors. This fusion allows for robust decision-making, balancing the need for consistency with the ability to respond to new and uncertain information.\nTo further enhance the robustness of FL in challenging IIoT environments, context-aware methodologies are crucial. These approaches involve designing FL systems that are not only aware of their operational context but can also adapt their learning and decision-making processes based on this context [14]. This might include adjusting learning rates, modifying model parameters, or selectively weighting data based on its source and quality. Context-aware systems are particularly adept at dealing with the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IIoT environments, where the operating conditions can vary widely and unpredictably. By being responsive to the specific context in which they operate, FL systems can optimize their performance and maintain high levels of accuracy and efficiency, even in the most challenging conditions.\nThese adaptive hybrid approaches in FL design offer a pathway to creating reliable and adaptable systems, capable of thriving in the diverse and often unpredictable landscapes of the IIoT.\nIn an IIoT setting employing an adaptive hybrid approach to FL integrated with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks, the architecture, shown in Figure 1, dynamically combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized machine learning models. IIoT devices like sensors and as-sembly machines process and analyze data locally, training AI models with data specific to their environments. This local processing is key in preserving data privacy and minimizing bandwidth usage. Here, the virtualization layer makes resource management and allocation easier, guaranteeing that IIoT devices are used effectively. Model aggregation is handled by FL aggregation servers, and VMs in the cloud offer scalable computational resources. Integration takes place through APIs, which guarantee safe communication and cooperative model training, boosting FL's credibility for IIoT.\nIn the adaptive hybrid model, these local devices periodi-cally send model updates to a central server, which aggregates these updates to refine a global model. However, unlike tradi-tional FL, this approach can adaptively choose when to rely more on local models and incorporate more from the global model, depending on factors like data diversity, model per-formance, and network conditions. This adaptability ensures optimal learning outcomes, balancing the need for customized local models with the benefits of a robust, generalized global model.\nThe integration of XAI in this adaptive hybrid framework is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust in the AI models. XAI tools provide insights into the decision-making processes of both local and global models, ensuring that AI decisions are interpretable and justifiable, a necessity in critical industrial applications. This approach not only enhances oper-ational efficiency and decision-making in IIoT environments but also ensures that AI models remain understandable and trustworthy to human operators, aligning with the evolving needs and constraints of the industrial sector."}, {"title": "IV.

Practical Insights", "content": "FL provides customized solutions for improving industrial processes in challenging industrial ecosystems. By coopera-tively enhancing pressure control among dispersed devices, FL can improve low-pressure processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. FL is also useful for evaluating equip-ment health in low-temperature conditions and optimizing temperature control in cryogenic industries, such as the man-ufacturing of liquefied natural gas. FL helps offshore oil and gas operations improve overall safety in challenging and remote environments and guarantee the quality of subsea equipment. Extreme temperature and pressure changes are addressed by FL in the aerospace manufacturing industry, which also optimizes furnace conditions and forecasts equip-ment failures to boost productivity. FL preserves data privacy, minimizes communication overhead, and allows collaborative model training directly on distributed IIoT devices, providing unique advantages for evaluating equipment health in low-temperature environments. This strategy preserves the confi-dentiality of sensitive data and guarantees real-time insights, which is essential for preserving equipment dependability under challenging conditions.\nFurthermore, FL is also used in mining operations to opti-mize autonomous vehicles, track the condition of equipment, and improve extraction procedures in difficult terrain. Such applications show the flexibility of FL in meeting certain industry requirements while maintaining data security and privacy.\nEnabling trustworthy FL in the context of IIoT presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities, primarily centered around balancing interpretability and robustness. FL, a decen-tralized approach to machine learning, allows for the training of algorithms across multiple devices or servers while keeping the data localized. This method is particularly beneficial for IIoT, where data security and privacy are paramount, and the data is often generated in distributed environments [15].\nOne key lesson learned is the importance of interpretability in FL models. In the industrial setting, stakeholders need to understand and trust the decisions made by AI models, especially when these decisions can have significant safety and financial implications. Interpretability in FL can be challenging due to the distributed nature of the model training, but it's crucial for ensuring that the models are reliable and their decisions are justifiable. Techniques such as model-agnostic methods, visualization tools, and simplified model architec-tures have been explored to enhance interpretability without compromising the model's performance.\nOn the other hand, robustness in FL is essential for main-taining the integrity and performance of the models in the face of diverse and often noisy industrial data. Robustness involves ensuring that the models are resistant to data anoma-lies, adversarial attacks, and other forms of disruptions that are common in IIoT environments. This requires advanced techniques like anomaly detection, data encryption, and secure aggregation protocols in the FL framework. The research in this area focuses on developing robust FL models that can withstand the challenges specific to industrial settings, such as variable data quality and potential cybersecurity threats.\nAn XAI model predicting machine failures through FL and IIoT frameworks in a manufacturing plant could provide interpretable features such as vibration levels, temperature fluctuations, and health status to diagnose unexpected issues, aiding in understanding the root causes of equipment failures and enabling proactive maintenance actions. Furthermore, ro-bust XAI models ensure the consistency of product quality by addressing quality variations in materials and environmental conditions. The interpretability feature allows supply chain managers to understand better the factors affecting perfor-mance and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, the robustness of the models helps manage supply chain disrup-tions, demand volatility, and unforeseen market changes. In packaging materials, interpretability allows inspectors to grasp the criteria used by XAI algorithms to detect defects and anomalies. To uphold product quality and brand reputation, the robustness of the model assists in estimating variations in surface textures, defects, and packaging configurations.\nLast, the integration of trustworthy FL in IIoT hinges on achieving a balance between interpretability and robustness. While interpretability ensures the transparency and trustwor-thiness of the models, robustness safeguards them against the diverse challenges in industrial environments. Ongoing research and practical applications are geared towards develop-ing methodologies and tools that enhance both aspects, thereby making FL a viable and reliable approach in the context of IIoT."}, {"title": "V.

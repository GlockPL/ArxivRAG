In the face of an aging population and increasing chronic disease, and anticipated shortages of healthcare workers, our society requires new efficient ways to deliver healthcare services [18]. Researchers have explored older adult care technologies [61] to support their independent living and improve their quality of life. The idea of such technologies [9, 12, 61] ranges from a personal alarm system worn by an older adult for raising the alarm in the case of an emergency situation, technologies that provide physical assistance [20, 25, 46, 61] or companionship [69], and intelligent systems that analyze sensor data to detect potential environmental hazards in the home environment and the abnormal activity patterns of an older adult [9, 61]. Among various technologies, this work focuses on an intelligent system that analyzes sensor data to recognize activities of daily living [23, 51, 52], detect a dangerous or abnormal situation (e.g. being idle for a long time, leaving home and wandering at abnormal hours, etc.) that may be indicative of changes in health status [53, 68], and alert an older adult's abnormal situation to a caregiver to provide an intervention if necessary [9, 61].\nAn intelligent system in the home environment that monitors activities of daily living might contribute to an increased sense of safety for older adults' independent living [84]. Previous studies have shown the value of reviewing observations of activities of daily living [43] and providing contextual information [83] to improve the self-awareness of older adults and the potential of a conversational agent to assist daily activities (e.g. alarms during cooking, getting weather information) [85]. However, the adoption of such technologies remains challenging due to several issues [19, 30, 84]: lack of usability and trust [84], lack of options to control these technologies [7] and privacy concerns [19]. Even if researchers have explored complex algorithms for more accurate detections of activities of daily living [51, 55] and abnormal events [53], the systems with complex algorithms operate as black-box systems. They only provide the"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "2.1 Older Adult Care Technologies\n2.1.1 Implementations and Applications. With the growth of the aging population [47], researchers have explored various older adult care technologies to support more independent living of older adults while improving the workflows of caregivers [61]. The implementation of these systems involves deploying sensors in an environment to collect continuous information on the occupants and their health (e.g. daily activities, heart rate, body temperature) [9, 12, 61]. These technologies can be realized in a variety of applications. For instance, these systems can provide reminders on taking a medication [43] or cognitive assistance on daily activities [28] or exercises [41]. In addition, these systems can detect the occurrence of abnormal or dangerous situations (e.g. a fall [2, 71, 83], night-time wandering [78]) and alert a caregiver or health professional [3] to provide the immediate, necessary support. In this paper, we focus on the application to monitor the daily activities of older adults and detect abnormal events for their safe and independent living.\nTo monitor the daily activities of older adults, researchers have explored various sensors, such as depth video sensors [12, 35], wall-mounted radio-frequency identifications (RFIDs) [23, 70], wearable sensors [51, 61], and wireless infrared"}, {"title": "2.2 Understanding Needs of Older Adults and Caregivers", "content": "One important factor in making a system more adoptable is to improve the user expectation of the potential value of a system [30, 34, 40, 56, 84]. Engagement with the users to understand their needs and preferences to design care technology is an active research topic. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research has made great strides in technology design and evaluation of care technologies through engagements with the users [7, 8, 26, 29, 33, 67]. For instance, prior studies have explored technology designs for an effective communication between care providers and adults with chronic conditions [8], child patients [33, 67], or people with dementia [26]. Harrington et al. had design sessions with older adults and provided recommendations for mobile fitness technologies [29]. Kuoppam\u00e4ki et al. [39] analyzed six video recordings of older adults preparing a meal in their kitchen to provide design implications for assistive kitchen technologies for aging in place. In addition to these design studies on specific contexts [8, 26, 29, 33, 67], previous studies also discussed that even if older adults considered the control of technologies is a very important factor for their acceptance [7, 50], existing monitoring technologies have the limitation of not being customizable to accommodate personal preference [42, 77]."}, {"title": "3 STUDY ON A HUMAN-CENTERED, INTELLIGENT SYSTEM FOR OLDER ADULT CARE", "content": "In this work, we engaged with family and professional caregivers and older adults to design a human-centered intelligent system for older adult care through the following three research activities. First, we conducted a focus-group session with four family caregivers to understand the practices and challenges of caregivers and specified the design spaces of the system. Based on the findings of the focus-group session, we implemented the high-level system prototype to illustrate its functionalities. In addition, we conducted a qualitative study of the system designs and functionalities with five professional caregivers and five older adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was not meant to be a comprehensive evaluation of our system, but to collect early feedback on our system designs and functionalities. During the qualitative study, we showed the video demonstration of the system to prompt discussions on the opportunities and limitations of the system and asked for new ideas for more empowering and controllable interactions with older adult care technologies."}, {"title": "4 FOCUS GROUP SESSION WITH CAREGIVERS", "content": "The objectives of an initial focus group with family caregivers were to learn about their experiences and challenges during the care services of an older adult and specify the design spaces of an intelligent system. For the focus group session, we recruited four family caregivers, who have had experiences to provide caregiving for their parents or grandparents (C1 - C4 in Table 1)."}, {"title": "4.1 Practices and challenges of the care services", "content": "The care services of an older adult broadly start with checking the status of an older adult and providing an adequate intervention if necessary.\n4.1.1 Regular check-ins through visiting or phone calls. For checking the status of an older adult, caregivers mainly rely on visiting or phone calls. \"What we do is just regular check-ins by speaking them on the phone and getting a sense of how things work\" (C1). Also, caregivers need to visit an older adult periodically and spend time together to understand the activities of an older adult as \u201cit is hard to get an older adult on the phone\u201d (C2). Such regular check-ins through visiting or phone calls \"are for a very affection. Sometimes, both of us are relatively sort of bored and feel stressed. Although I would like to move away, but she felt trapped\" (C3).\n4.1.2 Speculating Activities to check the status of an older adult. During visiting or phone calls, caregivers typically speculate on the daily activities of an older adult to determine the necessity of intervention. Especially, caregivers get a sense of when an older adult \"wake up, eat foods, spend spare time, and leave the house\" (C1). Caregivers then check any deviations of activity that occur, such as \u201ccanceling the regular dinner\u201d (C2). Also, C3 described the importance of identifying the situation or signs of falling: \"my father wasn't telling me anything about falling, but he told my boyfriend later and he wasn't able to get up for an hour (...) all of our emergency room visits were from his falling\u201d (C3). Although we observed several daily activities that are critical to monitor the status of an older adult, \"we cannot enumerate the list as it is very, very individualized.\u201d (C3). C3 also described the importance to get a sense of \"if the person is the same as the person you spoke with the last time\" (C3) through asking a question. Once a caregiver observes any situation (e.g. \"\"older adults cannot have a meal themselves\" - C2), caregivers will then figure out what services they could provide an older adult from social workers or a hospital.\n4.1.3 Preserve the independence and dignity of an older adult. All caregivers in the focus group session highlighted the importance of preserving the independence and dignity of an older adult. \"You really think this isn't a pet that you are just trying to keep alive. This is a person\" (C1). Sometimes, when a caregiver provides a service \u201cthat is not necessary, my dad felt the invasion of his privacy\u201d (C4). In addition, \u201cmost problems that older adults would get embarrassing. My dad carrying around a urine bag for several months\u201d (C3). Some older adults become \"stressful about receiving a service from a different person each time\u201d (C4). Thus, it is critical to make a balanced decision to provide an adequate intervention that preserves the independence and dignity of an older adult."}, {"title": "4.2 High-Level Designs of an Intelligent System", "content": "Based on our findings from the focus group session, we identified high-level designs of an intelligent system to improve the care practices of an older adult (Table 2). First, the system should recognize the daily activities of an older adult and detect abnormal events to reduce the caregiver's check-in visits or phone calls. During the focus-group session, we identified daily activities that are commonly used to check the status of an older adult. These activities include \"Waking up, Sleeping, Eating (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack), SpareTime, Leaving, Toileting, and Idle/Falling\". To preserve the independence and dignity of an older adult, the system should \"reduce the installation of a camera everywhere\u201d (C1) and prioritize the usage of non-visual sensors.\nIn addition, as an older adult might have different life patterns and preferences on what information can be shared, the system should be able to provide a means of personalization and control. Specifically, we observed that a caregiver usually engages in a conversation and asks a specific, tailored question to an older adult to seek out further information on an older adult for analyzing his/her status and determining an adequate intervention while preserving his/her dignity. Thus, the system should provide a way to facilitate communication between an older adult and a caregiver."}, {"title": "4.3 Use Cases", "content": "Based on the findings from our focus group session (Section 4.1), we specified five use cases of abnormal events. These use cases include 1) too frequent toilet usage, 2) abnormally leaving, 3) abnormal sleeping, 4) being idle for a long time, and 5) abnormal eating. One serious and prevailing disease for older women is urinary tract infections, in which an older adult might have urgency and frequent urination [24]. To detect these symptoms of urinary tract infections earlier, we included the first use case of frequent toilet usage. Also, we included abnormal leaving and sleeping, which are symptoms of dementia [36]. Another widespread concern of older adults is falls, but there are no effective preventive solutions for falling [83]. We included an abnormal event of being idle for a long time to detect a potential situation of falling. Lastly, as aging influences people's eating habits and affects their quality of life [45], we included the usage of detecting an abnormal eating event.\nOur five use cases based on the focus group are not an exhaustive list of use cases for an intelligent system that monitors activities of daily living for older adult care. Instead, the goal of these use cases is to demonstrate the functionalities of our system and receive the opinions of caregivers and older adults about the system. During the evaluation study, we also asked caregivers and older adults about additional use cases that should be considered (Appendix B)"}, {"title": "5 PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "Our main goal is to seek opinions and design ideas of caregivers and older adults on an intelligent system for older adult care. To facilitate the elicitation of their opinions and ideas, we developed an intelligent system to demonstrate its functionalities to caregivers and older adults. This system monitors the activities of an older adult and detects abnormal events using wireless motion sensors and machine learning. Also, this system utilizes interactive dialogue responses to explain abnormal patterns and allow caregivers to seek additional information about an older adult while an older adult can proactively determine what information is to be shared. The system consists of four major components: (a) monitoring module, (b) dialogue module, (c) interface of notifications and dialogue responses, and (d) database (Figure 1).\nFor monitoring the daily activities of an older adult, this work focused on exploring wireless motion sensors instead of a camera to preserve the privacy of an older adult (Table 2) [16]. This work assumes that wireless motion sensors have been deployed in the house of an older adult or a care center. Given sensor data based on the activities of an older adult,"}, {"title": "5.1 Sensor Data and Monitoring Module", "content": "For the development of a monitoring module, we utilized the dataset [52] that includes the recordings for 21 days of activities using 12 wireless motion sensors with the labels of 11 activities of daily living (ADL). We selected this dataset as it includes major daily activities that most caregivers leverage to understand the status of an older adult (Table 2). The dataset includes records of mounted wireless, infrared sensors in the inhabitant's house and track the daily activities of an inhabitant (a 57 year old male) in a specific area. Specifically, the sensor readings indicate the presence of a single inhabitant in a specific area (e.g. sitting on a couch) or the occurrence of a particular event (e.g. toilet being flushed). These measurements of the sensor values were discretized into time granularity At = 60 seconds, which was experimented with as the best time slice from [76]. Overall, the dataset included 30,240 time slices of monitoring ADLs.\nWe referred [52] and [68] to implement our activity recognition and anomaly detection respectively. For activity recognition, we utilized the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [54, 60] by learning the parameters using the maximum likelihood [60]. The observation, feature variable of the HMM is the vector of sensor readings (x = x1, x2, ..., xT) and the hidden variable is the activity label (y = Y1, Y2,..., YT) for a total T time slices. For the evaluation of activity recognition, we applied the leave-one-day-out cross-validation, in which we trained a model with data except data from one day for testing and achieved 0.85 accuracy and 0.62 F1-score.\nFor anomaly detection, we utilized the following four contextual features of an activity: (1) the transition, (2) the duration, (3) frequency, and (4) starting hour of activity, which can be clues for caregivers to understand abnormal events (Section 4.1). For the transition of activity, we utilized the learned transition probability of the HMM as the prior of the transition of an activity. We then computed the posterior to estimate the likelihood of transition of an activity label. For other contextual features of an activity (i.e. duration, frequency, starting hour), we assumed that they follow Gaussian distribution and utilized the 90% confidence intervals of corresponding Gaussian prior distribution to label an abnormal event [68]. For the contextual feature of the transition, we indicated the transition is abnormal if the transition probability of activity is below 0.05. For the evaluation of anomaly detection, we applied leave-one-day-out cross-validation and explored traditional supervised learning algorithms (e.g. decision tree, naive bayes, and support vector machine). We selected a decision tree as our model, which has not only high performance (i.e. an average of 0.89 accuracy and 0.88 F1-score) but also model interpretability [65].\nAs the focus of this work is to develop a prototype and receive early feedback on the functionalities of the system from older adults and caregivers, this work does not explore other complex algorithms [55, 55] and sensor data to improve the performance of the monitoring module."}, {"title": "5.2 Dialogue Module", "content": "The dialogue module is designed and implemented to support the interactions with both caregivers and older adults (Table 2). Specifically, our dialogue model focuses on (1) generating the explanation of a detected abnormal event and (2) eliciting additional information or confirming the status of an older adult while older adults can proactively determine what information to be shared.\nOur interface supports both chat-based interactions and voice-based dialogue responses using the Watson Cloud Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) services. Given a user response, we utilized IBM Watson conversation service [1] to recognize the intents or entities of the user response using at least 5 similar representative words. Given the recognized intents or entities, we designed and implemented the state machine to generate audio and text outputs (Appendix - Figure 3). Specifically, if the recognized intent belongs to a specific state, our dialogue module will make a transition to a corresponding node of the state machine and generate audio and text outputs based on its specified template (Appendix A.1)."}, {"title": "5.3 User Interface", "content": "We implemented the user interface using HTML and CSS for (1) providing the notification of an abnormal event and (2) supporting dialogue responses with a caregiver or an older adult.\nThe notification interface includes only brief information about an abnormal event (e.g. which abnormal activity is detected and when it has occurred) (Figure 2a). To highlight the detected abnormal event, we included red background color. The dialogue response interface aims to explain an abnormal event to a caregiver (Figure 2b) and elicit any additional information or status of an older adult (Figure 2c).

Social isolation is a prevalent problem of older adults, which might lead to numerous detrimental health conditions [15, 49]. Similar to the prior research work on a companion agent [69], older adults considered that the value of interactive dialogue responses to reduce the feeling of social isolation: \u201ceven having a conversation with a system to check the status would help reduce the feeling of isolation from an older adult\" (O1)."}, {"title": "7.2 Perceived Limitations & Challenges of Using the System", "content": "7.2.1 Questionable System Performance and Efficiency.

In addition, caregivers and older adults are concerned whether a system can monitor detailed activities (e.g. medication taking): \"more difficult to understand if an older adult really takes them [medication] or not\" (C6).\n7.2.2 Dependency on a Complex System. Caregivers had concerns about having constraints on their workflows \"if we (they) have to be dependent on being connected to a system\" (C5).

Older adults described the limitation of interactive dialogue responses to interact and notify an urgent situation. Specifically, older adults questioned whether they have to be \"at a certain location to engage interactive dialogue responses with the system?\" (05). In addition, as interactive dialogue responses require multiple steps to confirm the status of an older adult and seek assistance, they are \"worried about the situation when an older adult cannot respond to the system through dialogue responses (...)

Thus, we recommend considering the potential of exploring multimodal data to improve the system performance on understanding fine-level daily activities while providing a means of controlling multimodal sensing in different situations (e.g. enabling silhouette sensing on high risks of a falling event).\nIn addition to the exploitation of multimodality [73": "the investigation of omnipresent interactions would be also beneficial to improve user experience with the system. Although older adults appreciated the value of interactive dialogue responses to improve the control and personalized interactions of the system, they considered that dialogue responses of our system provide limited interactions during an emergency (Section 7.2.3).

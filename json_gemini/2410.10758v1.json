INTRODUCTION", "content": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that measures the heart's electrical activity [1]. It has been used in various applications, such as arrhythmia detection, emotion recognition, and biometric identification, by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques [2]-[8].\nAdditionally, with the recent advancements in graph neural network (GNN), there has been growing research on applying deep learning for ECG signal analysis. GNN is neural networks designed to learn from data represented in graph structures. A graph consists of nodes and edges, and GNN learn the relationships between these nodes and edges. Unlike traditional neural networks, which learn from vectorized data, GNN can capture the structural information of a graph. GNN has been used for arrhythmia classification based on a connectivity graph structure reflecting the temporal position of ECG signals [9] and lead based graph classification of arrhythmias [10]. GNN offer high interpretability and performance by transforming the inherent knowledge of the data into adjacency matrices, reflecting the connectivity between features. This study proposes GNN-based arrhythmia classification method that utilizes Pearson correlation matrices [11] derived from the features of ECG. In this method, features with high correlations are considered. After generating the adjacency matrix, features are extracted using GNN, and these are combined with features extracted from a linear neural network to classify arrhythmias.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describe dataset collection method, feature extraction, graph generation, and the proposed model. Section 3 compares the results of previous studies with those of the proposed model. Section 4 concludes with analysis results and future research directions."}, {"title": "II. MATERIAL AND METHODS", "content": "The dataset used the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database from PhysioNet [12]. This database consists of 48 records collected from 47 subjects, with each record containing 30 minutes of 2 lead ECG sampled at 360 Hz. In accordance with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations, four records were excluded [13]. The remaining records were divided into a training set comprising 22 records and the rest into a test set.\nFurthermore, we utilized only the major classes non- ectopic beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), and ventricular ectopic beats (V). We followed the guidelines [13] for arrhythmia belonging to that class. Also we focused solely on a lead II."}, {"title": "B. Feature extraction and graph generation", "content": "We applied a moving average filter with a 72 samples window to remove baseline noise from the ECG. This was followed by another moving average filter with a 216 samples window. To further eliminate high-frequency noise, we applied a 12th-order finite impulse response (FIR) filter, passing frequencies between 0.5 Hz and 35 Hz. After filtering, we segmented the ECG signals by extracting 86 samples before and 130 samples after each R peak. Subsequently, we applied the Pan-Tompkins algorithm [14] to extract PQRST segments. A total of 20 features were then extracted for each record. As a result, we collected training dataset with dimensions of (50,557, 20) and a test dataset with dimensions of (49,273, 20) samples. Subsequently, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients for the features. If the correlation coefficient was 0.9 or higher, we set it to 1 (indicating a connection), and for values below 0.9, we set it to 0 (indicating no connection). This process resulted in the adjacency matrix. Based on the connectivity in this adjacency matrix, we set edges between nodes, with the node features being represented by the extracted features."}, {"title": "C. Proposed model", "content": "Our proposed model and output shape in each layer are illustrated in Figure 1.\nWe obtained feature x and the edge index from the graph and input them into both a linear and a graph neural layer. Afterward, the outputs from both networks were concatenated and passed through linear layer. For the graph neural layer, we used the GraphSAGE [15] . And we applied the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function [16] and adopted the Adam optimizer [17] with learning rate of 0.01, cross-entropy loss [18] and 700 epochs for model training."}, {"title": "III.

CONCLUSION", "content": "This study designed a GNN based on the correlation coefficient for arrhythmia classification. Our results showed that our model achieved a precision and recall of over 50% across all classes. This suggests the potential of our model to minimize false positives. This approach demonstrates the potential for an explainable model by generating graphs based on high correlation coefficients. Future research will focus on evaluating performance in multi-lead cases to ultimately identify the optimal graph structure."}]}

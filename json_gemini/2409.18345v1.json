The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) during the conceptual design phase is particularly becoming a norm in industry and academia. A recent survey by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) reported that 68% of the responding architects are already using generative Al, such as text-to-image models, for early design visualization\nWhile the application of LLMs in BIM tasks beyond the early design phase is still in an early stage, it is foreseeable that BIM systems with natural language interfaces supported by LLMs will supplant BIM tools with traditional user interfaces in the near future. In this paper, we use the term \"LLM-augmented BIM\" as a general expression to indicate a task or a process of querying, generating, and managing BIM data and/or models via speech or text in natural language. We refer to the former as \"speech-to-BIM\" and the latter as \"text-to-BIM\u201d tasks. Existing examples of \"speech-to-BIM\u201d applications include BIMlogiq Copilot (BIMLOGIQ n.d.; Corke 2023) and BIMIL AI Helper (BIMPeers 2024).

Examples of this include optimizing the space layout of a hospital using generative design (Aupy 2019) and exploring potential combinations of modules for modular buildings by integrating LLMs with generative design (Gaier et al. 2023). However, these generative design cases were not language driven.\nWith the advancements in generative adversarial networks (GAN) and LLMs, many text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (OpenAI n.d.), Midjourney (Midjourney n.d.), and DALL-E (OpenAl n.d.), have become available. And it has become increasingly common for students and architects to use these text-to-image models to generate early conceptual renderings of buildings from prompts in natural language. While these Al-generated renderings are not always as accurate as mathematically calculated renderings and may sometimes lack practical feasibility, they are rapidly gaining traction in both industry and academia due to their speed and low computational demands, often providing architects with unexpected inspirations.\nBased on these advancements, a plethora of commercial products for Al-assisted early design are also available, including SketchUp Diffusion (Trimble 2023), Autodesk Forma (Autodesk n.d.), Finch 3D (Finch n.d.), and ARCHITECHTURES (ARCHITECHTURES n.d.). These are just a few examples. With rapid advances in generative Al, the number of AI tools for conceptual design is expected to grow rapidly."}, {"title": "2.2 Other Natural Language-Driven BIM Tasks", "content": "While the use of Al for conceptual design is becoming widespread, its application in other tasks remains relatively uncommon. This disparity might be due to the fact that generative Al excels in creativity, which is crucial for early-stage conceptual designs. Conceptual designs can afford a broader tolerance for inaccuracies compared to detailed designs, which require a high level of"}, {"title": "3 The Generalized LLM-Augmented BIM Framework", "content": "As described in the Introduction section, the generalized LLM-augmented BIM framework consists of six steps: i.e., interpret-fill-match-structure-execute-check. Previously, we proposed the NADIA framework, which includes four steps: interpret, fill, structure, and execute. The generalized LLM-augmented BIM framework adds two more steps: match and check.\nThe interpret, fill, and structure steps are generally performed by an LLM, and the match and check steps are performed by both an LLM and a BIM tool, and the perform step by a BIM tool. Here are descriptions of each step:\n1) Interpret: This step identifies a BIM task and the required subtasks and information to perform the BIM task from a natural language command input.\n2) Fill: Natural language commands are often incomplete. This step supplements the missing information by leveraging the knowledge that an LLM is trained on or by prompting the user to input the missing information.\n3) Match: The natural language terms and the names of objects and properties in a BIM tool may not align. Consequently, semantic matching between the natural language terms (or input prompt) and the BIM tool terms (or target BIM objects) must be performed.\n4) Structure: BIM tools can only accommodate data or instructions given in a structured machine-readable form: e.g., structured queries, data in a machine-readable format or computer code.\n5) Execute: A BIM tool executes the computer code, structured queries, or a series of commands utilizing the data passed from an LLM.\n6) Check: The generative capability of an LLM is both its strength and weakness. Depending on whether the resultant outcome is valid or not, the outcome can be regarded as creative or as unreliable. The \"check\" step evaluates the validity of a generated solution against the given requirements such as checklists, design guidelines, and codes and regulations. The validation can be performed by running a simple checker, by connecting an LLM with a database of design requirements through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nThese steps are represented as a linear sequential process but may be conducted in parallel or different orders. Also, some of these steps may be skipped depending on the task. For example, simple tasks such as \"Rotate a model 90 degrees on the X axis\" is unlikely to require \"Fill\" or \"Check\" steps. The next section demonstrates an application example."}, {"title": "4 Application example", "content": "Generating a detailed wall object and applying it to a model in current BIM tools requires more than 20 clicks and additional edits of property values. If a new version of a building information modeling (BIM) tool is released with a new menu structure or a new graphical user interface (GUI), the cognitive load required to remember all the commands and their sequence is very heavy. It is common for architects who do not use BIM tools daily to quickly lose their ability to use the tools effectively."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "As LLM technologies, along with Al, continue to evolve, their role in AEC will likely expand, reducing the cognitive load on professionals to learn and remember new or frequently updated tools and sequences of commands and, eventually, enabling more efficient and precise execution of BIM tasks. However, a generalized and structured approach for developing a system that integrates LLMs and BIM tools to perform BIM tasks in natural language has not yet been explored. This study proposes a generalized LLM-augmented BIM framework, which divides the implementation steps into interpret-fill-match-structure-execute-check. It builds upon NADIA's interpret-fill-structure-execute framework.\nThis study demonstrated the potential of the generalized LLM and BIM integration framework through the implementation of NADIA-S. While the experiment was simple, it clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework could enhance the future speech-to-BIM application development. Future studies on the following four areas can benefit the development of mature LLM-augmented BIM applications.\nSemantic Matching: While essential, semantic matching can be complex, especially in the context of domain-specific language used in BIM. Exploring advanced natural language processing techniques could enhance accuracy.\nLLM Capabilities: The effectiveness of the framework heavily relies on the capabilities of the LLM used. Research into LLMs specifically trained on BIM data or architecture-related tasks could improve performance, particularly for the first and the second steps, \u201cInterpret\u201d and \u201cFill\u201d.\nValidity checking: There have been quite a few studies on BIM data quality checking and design compliance checking. However, evaluating the outcomes of an Al is challenging and remains much to be explored.\nUser Interaction: The framework could benefit from developing and incorporating advanced user feedback mechanisms to refine the generated BIM models and improve overall user experience.\nAlthough the effectiveness of the proposed framework was demonstrated with a focus on wall detailing via speech-to-BIM, it can also be applied to any natural-language-driven BIM tasks, such as data querying, design compliance checking, data management, data analysis, question answering, cost and schedule estimation, and more. We hope that the proposed framework will accelerate the development of LLM-augmented BIM systems, ultimately enhancing the usability and efficiency of BIM tools for professionals."}]}

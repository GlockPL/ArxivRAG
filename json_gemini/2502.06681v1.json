While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust Re-ID systems capable of handling long-term scenarios, where persons' appearances can change significantly due to variations in clothing and physical characteristics. In this paper, we present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset specifically designed for long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA consists of recordings from strategically placed cameras over a seven-month period, capturing significant variations in both temporal and appearance attributes, including controlled changes in participants' clothing and physical features. The dataset includes 22 individuals, four connected indoor environments, and seven cameras. We collected more than five hours of video that we semi-automatically labeled to generate around one million bounding boxes with identity annotations. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "Background & Summary", "content": "Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging problem in computer vision that involves matching individuals across different camera views, locations and times. This task becomes even more complex when considering long-term scenarios, where persons may change their appearance due to variations in clothing or alterations in physical characteristics.\nEarly Re-ID research relied on datasets that primarily focused on short-term Re-ID, involving single images or small image sequences. These datasets typically feature low-resolution images and limited temporal information. In later years, with the advent of deep learning, larger datasets began to appear. These datasets expanded the number of identities (IDs), provided more views of the same person from different cameras and offered longer sequences.\nThe most recent datasets directly provide the complete videos of the sequences, with the necessary bounding boxes and ID annotations, so that they can be used to evaluate the actual performance of video re-identification systems, and can take advantage of complementary tracking techniques. \nWhile many of these existing datasets focus on short-term Re-ID, there is a growing need for datasets that capture the variability of individuals' appearances over extended periods. Such datasets are crucial for developing more robust Re-ID algorithms capable of handling real-world challenges, particularly in environments where individuals frequently change their clothing or physical characteristics. Existing datasets often lack the variability in clothing and appearance changes, making them less suitable for training and evaluating models designed for long-term Re-ID scenarios."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "In this Section, we describe the capture setup and environment, including the specifications and placement of the cameras, the interconnection architecture, and the software used for data capture, organization, and labeling.\nThis study was conducted under the supervision of the Ethical Committee of the University of Alicante (Approval No. UA-2022-11-12).

The capture setup involves two main items: the physical spaces and the cameras placed in them.\nRegarding the physical spaces in which the dataset has been captured, the layout of the area covered by the cameras is shown in Figure 1. The environment features a typical office setting with computers, desks, chairs, panels and whiteboards. Some objects eventually appear in some videos such as robots, cardboard boxes or others. As the videos are captured during a large time frame, the appearance of the environments slightly changed from one to another. There are three large working areas, one large corridor and one small office. These areas have the following settings. L1 is a big laboratory of 33.3 m\u00b2 of area that is connected to the main corridor H1 and has a camera C7 placed in the opposite corner of the door, pointing at it. L2 is another laboratory of 20.64 m\u00b2 that contains two cameras: C2, which is located in the opposite corner of the door, pointing at it; and C3, which is located in the south-west corner of the room, pointing at the office Ol door.

It has an area of 44.01 m\u00b2 that is covered by camera C6 and C5. H1 is connected to the three laboratories L1, L2 and L3."}, {"title": "Hardware, Connection Architecture and Synchronization", "content": "The hardware component of the system primarily consists of a network of cameras. The selected cameras are Reolink RLC- 410W, which are equipped with a 1/2.7\" CMOS image sensor and deliver 5.0 megapixel resolution. Each camera features a 4.0 mm lens with an aperture of F/2.0, providing an 80\u00b0 horizontal and 58\u00b0 vertical field of view. In addition, they include backlight compensation to enhance image quality. The video is compressed using the H.264 format. Despite the cameras' capability of recording at 2560\u00d71920 pixels, videos were captured at 1080\u00d7720 pixels to prevent network congestion and maintain a consistent 30 fps across all cameras.\nThe camera network consists of seven cameras deployed in the environment. Although these cameras support WiFi connectivity, most of them were connected via Ethernet cables to ensure a faster and more stable connection. Six of the cameras were connected to a central router using Cat 6 Ethernet cables, while one camera (C7) was connected via WiFi. The selected router is the Asus RT-AC3100 Gigabit Router, which features 8 Ethernet ports and solid WiFi capabilities.\nTo complete the setup, a server computer was incorporated into the system. The chosen machine is powered by an Intel i9-13900K processor with 32 cores running at 5.5 GHz, paired with 32 GB of DDR4 RAM, and operates on Ubuntu 20.04. This server is responsible for running the interconnection framework, retrieving images from all cameras, synchronizing them, and storing the collected data.\nTo do all these tasks, we rely on ROS (Robotic Operating System) Noetic. ROS is a comprehensive collection of software libraries and tools designed to support the development of robotic applications. It offers everything from device drivers to advanced algorithms, along with a suite of powerful tools for developers. It also includes tools to connect to remote cameras, retrieve images from them, and allows the implementation of custom synchronization techniques.\nTo ensure synchronization among all the cameras and guarantee that they all capture the same moment in time, the process begins by waiting several seconds to establish stable connections with each camera. This delay ensures that all cameras are properly initialized and ready to operate without any interruptions. Additionally, the frame buffer in the camera software is disabled to prevent delays caused by accumulated frames, ensuring real-time visualization of the captured frames. Furthermore, a uniform capture frequency is configured across all cameras, allowing for consistent synchronization and ensuring that all cameras capture the exact same moment in time as closely as possible. This combination of techniques minimizes the risk of desynchronization and maximizes the accuracy of the system for time-sensitive applications.\nEach camera is launched in parallel within a separate ROS node, utilizing OpenCV's functionality to connect to the video stream via the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). This setup ensures efficient management of multiple video streams, enabling the system to handle concurrent connections to each camera. By assigning each camera to an independent node, the architecture leverages the distributed nature of ROS, allowing for better scalability and resource management while maintaining the synchronization and real-time performance required for the application."}, {"title": "Procedure", "content": "The procedure for recording a sequence is straightforward. The person in charge of the dataset started recording at a random moment of the day. The subjects present in the environment were instructed to move around without any specific purpose. No constraints were applied to their dynamics, interactions, or behaviors. This approach aimed to capture realistic scenarios, which involve multiple person occlusions, changes in trajectories, and even variations in clothing or appearance, posing a significant challenge to person Re-ID methods.\nNonetheless, the process of labeling the sequences involves both automatic labeling algorithms and manual annotation. First, individuals are extracted from each video using the YOLOv8 algorithm. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) is a deep learning-based object detection architecture capable of predicting the location and class of specific objects within an image. It has different model sizes considering the depth of the architecture, the runtime and the accuracy it provides. The YOLOv8x (extra-large) version is used as it provides the best accuracy. In our case, we feed the architecture with all the frames in order to retrieve the regions occupied by persons. The actual output consists of the X and Y coordinates of the opposite corners of each person's bounding box. Despite YOLOv8 being a state-of-the-art object detection method, it is not flawless, so each automatically generated label was manually verified, being confirmed or corrected when necessary. Additionally, new labels were assigned to individuals who were missed by the automatic detection process.\nIt should be noted that individuals are labeled only if they can be sufficiently identified; otherwise, their labels are removed. In addition to the bounding box annotations, the dataset includes a unique ID for each person. These IDs were labeled following a semi-automatic approach based on Deep SORT. Deep SORT is an advanced object tracking method that extends the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm by incorporating deep learning for more accurate tracking. It leverages appearance features extracted by a deep neural network to improve track association, allowing it to handle occlusions and re-identify objects more effectively across frames. The algorithm was applied to all videos in our dataset to retrieve tracklets, which were subsequently reviewed and corrected manually to ensure accuracy. Importantly, the assigned IDs remain consistent across all cameras and sequences.\nTo streamline and expedite the manual verification and correction of bounding boxes and ID annotations, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI). This tool significantly facilitates the labeling process. The GUI is publicly available at."}, {"title": "Evaluation Metrics", "content": "This dataset can be used for evaluation from two different but complementary points of view: pure Re-ID of persons and tracking of persons, allowing both, algorithms that perform only one of the two tasks and those that incorporate both facets to be evaluated."}, {"title": "Person Tracking Metrics", "content": "In terms of person tracking metrics, which assess the ability of algorithms for short-term recognition, i.e., to detect a person, identify them and follow them while they remain in the scene until they leave it. In this respect, we will rely on the CLEAR MOT Metrics to define the following metrics to evaluate the tracking of persons on individual cameras since the areas covered by each camera do not overlap each other, or the percentage of overlap is low.\nTo understand the following metrics, we must define some concepts:\n\u2022 Fragmentation (FM). The number of interruptions in a ground truth trajectory. A fragmentation is recorded each time a trajectory's status changes from \"tracked\" to \"untracked\" and tracking of the same trajectory is resumed at a later point.\n\u2022 Identity Switch (IDSW). The number of times the reported ID associated with a ground truth trajectory changes throughout the tracking process. This occurs when the tracking system incorrectly reassigns the ID of a tracked person to a different ID.\n\u2022 Mostly Tracked (MT). The percentage of ground truth trajectories that correctly assigned the same ID label for at least 80% of their lifespan.\n\u2022 Mostly Lost (ML). The percentage of ground-truth trajectories that are successfully tracked for no more than 20% of their lifespan.\n\u2022 False Positive (fpt). The number of targets the tracker detects in frame t where there is none in the ground truth.\n\u2022 False Negative (fn\u2081). The number of true targets missed by the tracker in frame t.\nThe most used metric to evaluate multi-object tracking performance for a single-camera is Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), which is defined as shown in Equation 1.\n$MOTA = 1 - \\frac{FN + FP + IDSW}{GT}$ (1)\nwhere:\nFN = total number of false negatives over all frames.\nFP = total number of false positives over all frames.\nIDSW = total number of ID switches over all frames.\nGT = total number of ground truth detections over all frames.\nMOTA can be seen as derived from three error ratios:\n\u2022 The ratio of false negatives in the sequence, computed over the total number of objects present in all frames, shown in Equation 2.\n\u2022 The ratio of false positives, shown in Equation 3.\n\u2022 The ratio of ID switches, shown in Equation 4.\n$FN_{ratio} = \\frac{FN}{GT}$ (2)"}, {"title": "", "content": "$FP_{ratio} = \\frac{FP}{GT}$ (3)\n$IDSW_{ratio} = \\frac{IDSW}{GT}$ (4)\nMOTA takes into account all object configuration errors made by the tracker across all frames: false positives, false negatives and ID switches. It provides a very intuitive measure of the tracker's performance in detecting objects and maintaining their trajectories, regardless of the accuracy with which object locations are estimated.\nA complementary metric is IDF1, which evaluates the consistency of object IDs over time. Specifically, IDF1 measures the F1-score of correctly matched object trajectories, using intersection over union (IoU) and a threshold, considering both the precision and recall of the identifications at the frame level. IDP (ID Precision) measures the precision of detected trajectories that are correctly matched with the ground truth trajectories while IDR (ID Recall) measures the recall of ground truth trajectories that are correctly matched with the detected trajectories. The final IDF1-Score is the harmonic mean of IDP and IDR, calculated as shown in Equation 5.\n$IDF1 = 2* \\frac{IDP * IDR}{IDP + IDR}$ (5)\nIDF1 is particularly important because it evaluates how well an algorithm maintains the consistency of object IDs across frames. Unlike MOTA, IDF1 places additional emphasis on the quality of ID matching."}, {"title": "Re-identification Metrics", "content": "Tracking metrics evaluate a method's ability to maintain the same ID throughout a sequence once it has been assigned. However, these metrics do not account for the system's ability to re-identify individuals across different sequences, particularly when a person leaves the scene and a significant amount of time has passed before their reappearance. In this Section, short-term tracking capability is set aside, and the emphasis is placed on the system's ability to recognize IDs across different cameras, viewpoints, and noticeable changes in appearance.\nThe Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) is a widely used evaluation metric in person Re-ID tasks for assessing the performance of recognition algorithms. The CMC curve represents the probability that a correct match appears within the top k ranks of a ranked list of matches. This metric provides a function of different k-rank accuracies, as defined in Equation 6.\n$Acc_k = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if top-k ranked gallery samples contain the query ID}\\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$ (6)\nIn a typical person Re-ID scenario, the system is given a query image of a person, and it has to find the correct match from a gallery of images. The system ranks all images in the gallery based on similarity to the query image. The CMC curve plots the probability of the correct match being within the top k ranked positions across all queries. This metric is suitable for scenarios where the task is to rank potential matches rather than to assign a binary label to them. This ranking approach is crucial because, in large datasets, the probability of a random match being correct is very low, making it an ineffective metric for recognition. The CMC curve addresses this by focusing on ranking performance rather than binary classification performance. One of the most important associated metrics is the rank-1 accuracy, which means the system can correctly identify an individual from the probe camera in the gallery camera as the top match.\nCMC evaluation measurement is valid only if there is only one ground truth match for a given query. However, if multiple ground truths exist, the CMC curve can be biased because recall is not considered. Therefore, an alternative metric to evaluate the overall performance of the Re-ID system is the Mean Average Precision (mAP). For each query, the area under the Precision-Recall curve, referred to as average precision (AP), is computed. Precision can be defined as the ratio between correct ID correspondences (True Positives) and the number of retrieved correspondences, as shown in Equation 7.\n$precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$ (7)\nBy default, precision takes all the retrieved correspondences into account, but it can also be evaluated at a given number of retrieved images, commonly known as cut-off rank, where the model is only assessed by considering its top-most queries. The"}, {"title": "", "content": "measure is called precision at k or P@k. Using the P@k we can calculate the average precision (AP@n) for a number n of matches, as shown in Equation 8. The final AP is the value of AP@n when all the ground truth positives have been obtained.\n$AP@n= \\frac{1}{GTP} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} P@k*rel@k.$ (8)\nwhere:\nGTP = total number of ground truth positives (correct samples of the query class),\nn = total number of candidate matches (n elements most similar to the query),\nrel@k = relevance function that equals 1 if the ID at rank k is correct.\nSubsequently, the mean of all AP values across all queries, known as mAP, is calculated, as shown in Equation 9. This metric takes into account both the precision and recall of an algorithm, offering a more thorough evaluation.\n$mAP = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} API$ (9)\nwhere:\nN = total number of queries,\ni = index for the i-th query,"}, {"title": "Data Records", "content": "The dataset is composed of a collection of videos, as provided by the set of cameras in the environment, and the corresponding Re-ID labels.

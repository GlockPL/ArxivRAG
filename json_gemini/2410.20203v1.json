Introduction", "content": "Accurate measurement of the flow field, as a fundamental tool in various research\ntopics, such as fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, etc., is still a challenging task for\ndata\u00b9. It is true that the rapid evolution of digital imagery and the fast growth of\ncomputational power play a vital role in the development of image-based diagnostic\ntechniques\u00b2. Of the developed techniques, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar\nlaser-induced fluorescence ( PLIF ) could be an appropriate demonstration that most of\nthose measurements required complicated and expansive setups\u00b3. The specified laser\nsources and artificial particles also prevent those \u201chigh-tech\u201d methods from moving\noutside the laboratory condition. Thus, a simple, cost-effective, and real non-invasive\ntechnique to measure the flow field under common circumstances is worthwhile to\ndevelop.\nBy mentioning flow field measurement, there is no doubt that the velocity fields\nare one of the most basic and fundamental properties that deserve the dominant\nattention and efforts. For a general isothermal and incompressible (or weak\ncompressible) condition, velocity is the majority of information that needs to be\ncollected from the flow field. However, after taking the thermo or compress effect into"}, {"title": "", "content": "account, one additional variable from the equation of state deserves to be studied in\norder to cover the thermodynamic effect. Usually, the obtainable information is density,\npressure, and temperature. The method introduced in this publication provides a brand-\nnew means of measuring the density field.\nQualitative visualization of the density field has long been studied and used in the\ninvestigation of flow fields for the past few decades. There is a huge amount of methods\nthat are able to achieve to goal of qualitative visualization, such as passive tracers of\nneutrally buoyant particles, shadowgraph, schlieren etc. These methods are still\npopular in studying the phenomenon accompanied by aerodynamic or hydrodynamic\neffects. Researchers also keep attempts to extract quantitative information from\nqualitative visualization results for the following decades. The early stage of\ninvestigation about quantitatively measuring the density fields focused mostly on the\nSchlieren technique. As the Schlieren method itself is mainly focused on the large\ndensity gradient', the sharp knife edge will enhance the change of greater density\nchange, while neglecting the less apparent ones. The quantification of the density field\nbased on the traditional Schlieren setup is quite limited. Then, a novel method purely\nbased on the computer vision technique of digital image correlation (DIC) was\nproposed. Due to the highly developed image process program, the experiment setup\nhas been simplified to an extreme extent. Based on its fundamental theory of image\nprocessing, the method is called background-oriented schlieren (BOS). A huge number\nof researches have been undertaken following the rules of BOS9\u201311. However, due to its\nimage processing fundament, this method is highly sensitive to the spatial resolution12.\nIn other words, the BOS method is similar to the traditional Schlieren method in the\naspect of focusing on great density gradient instead of treating everything equally.\nTo overcome the limitation described previously, the method introduced in this\npublication uses the shadowgraph technique instead. The main difference between the\nshadowgraph and to Schlieren technique is the knife edge that cuts the strength of the\nlight source. Without the knife edge, the gradient distribution will neither be enhanced\nnor diminished. This could be a reliable starting point for quantitatively measuring the\ndensity of the flow field. Previously, researchers used a numerical approach to solve the\ndifferential equations derived from the relationship between shadowgraph and density\nto solve simple cases such as pulsed positive streamer13. However, as the pre-solved\nequation is an elliptic partial differential equation, the result is mainly based on the\nboundary condition, which prevents this method from being widely used for more\ngeneral conditions. With the help of a recently developed deep learning method, this\nlimitation could be overcome.\nAs a common sense, deep learning has achieved great progress in fields like\ncomputer vision and natural language processing. As research has advanced, there has\nbeen growing interest in leveraging deep learning to model real-world physical\nproblems and aid scientific discovery, including fluid mechanics. While computer\nversion techniques have partially addressed the challenge of flow field reconstruction."}, {"title": "", "content": "But many scientific and engineering problems are governed by well-established\nphysical laws, and integrating these governing equations directly into deep learning\nframeworks can lead to more accurate and physically consistent solutions.\nA key development in this direction is the introduction of physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) by Raissi et al.14, which have become a powerful tool for solving\ncomplex problems. Since PINN has been developed in the past few years, it has also\nintroduced fluid dynamics15-17. As an important topic in the fluid dynamic study, the\ndiagnostic of the flow field plays a vital role in the experimental investigation of fluid.\nCai et al.'s work could be a brief example to demonstrate the principle of the\ncombination of PINN and traditional diagnostics techniques.\nThis study is grounded in practical optical physics. A PINN is proposed that utilizes\nshadowgraph images to reconstruct density fields. The model takes the shadowgraph\nimages as inputs to reconstruct the refractive index field. Subsequently, the density field\nis derived using the relationship described by the Gladstone-Dale law. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the density field reconstruction method maintains high\naccuracy under various scenarios, including natural convection, forced convection, and\ncombustion cases. As an efficient and precise reconstruction method, it serves as a\npromising surrogate model for real-time sensing and monitoring of thermal fluid. This\napproach not only enhances the understanding of fluid dynamics but also offers a\npowerful tool in flow field diagnostics.\nThis paper is developed as follows.

Finally, chapter 5 concludes this paper."}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Shadow Imaging and Density Measurement", "content": "The shadowgraph method is widely used in experimental fluid dynamics and heat\ntransfer research. The main idea of this method is based on the principles of light\nrefraction inhomogeneous density fields. Figure 1 illustrates a typical schematic of the\nshadowgraph method. When light rays pass through a collimator, they form parallel\nrays that enter the experimental area. If there are disturbances in the experimental\nregion caused by density variations, the light will be refracted to different extents based\non changes in the refractive index. This leads to the formation of varying light intensity\ndistributions on the receiving screen. By observing and analyzing these shadow patterns,\ninformation such as the refractive index in the experimental area can be obtained. The\nfollowing is a brief derivation of the shadowgraph method."}, {"title": "", "content": "In the beginning, it is assumed that the refractive index of the medium is\ndetermined by spatial coordinates n = n(x, y, z). The coordinates of the incident point\nand the exit point of the light ray are represented as p\u2081 and pe, respectively. The point\nwhere the light ray projects onto the screen can be expressed as follows.\n$x_i = x_p + L\\frac{dx}{dz}|_{p_e}$\n$y_i = y_p + L\\frac{dy}{dz}|_{p_e}$\nEquation (2.1) can be further simplified by the weak refraction assumption 18.\n$x_i = x_p + L \\cdot \\int_{z_i}^{z_e} \\frac{\\partial log n}{\\partial x} dz$\n$y_i = y_p + L \\cdot \\int_{z_i}^{z_e} \\frac{\\partial log n}{\\partial y} dz$\nThis assumption posits that the light rays that strike the entrance plane\nperpendicularly experience only minor deflections within the uneven field, yet they\nexhibit a measurable curvature upon exiting the experimental setup.\nTo further analyze the light rays projected on the screen. After passing through the\nexperimental region with a non-uniform refractive field, the light intensity of the light\nsource I(x,y\u2081) and screen I(x,y) can be expressed as follows.\n$I(x_i, y_i) = \\Sigma\\frac{I_o(x,y)}{\\frac{\\partial(x_i,y_i)}{\\partial(x,y)}}$"}, {"title": "", "content": "Where $\\frac{\\partial(x_i,y_i)}{\\partial(x,y)}$ is the Jacobian determinant for the transformation of the coordinate\nsystem from (x,y) to (x,y).\nDue to the infinitesimal displacement assumption, the higher-order terms in the\nJacobian determinant can be neglected. Thus, the mapping function can be\napproximated as a linear transformation, and the Jacobian determinant can be expressed\nas follows."}, {"title": "", "content": "$\\frac{\\partial(x_i,y_i)}{\\partial(x,y)} = |1+L\\frac{\\partial^2(x_i - x_p)}{\\partial x} \\; L\\frac{\\partial^2(x_i - x_p)}{\\partial y}|$\nSo, the Eq. (2.3) can be rewritten as follows.\n$I_i(x_i, y_i) = I_0[1+L\\frac{\\partial^2(x_i - x_p)}{\\partial x} + L\\frac{\\partial^2(y_i - y_p)}{\\partial y}] = \\Sigma I_o(x,y)$\nFinally, substituted Eq. (2.2) into Eq. (2.5) and integrated over the dimensions of\nthe experimental section. The relationship between light intensity variation in the\nshadowgraph image to the refractive index field can be modeled using a Poisson\nequation as follows.\n$\\frac{I_0(x_i, y_i)-I_i(x_i, y_i)}{I_i(x_i, y_i)} = (L x D)(\\frac{\\partial^2 log n(x,y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 log n(x,y)}{\\partial y^2})$\nFor transparent media, refractive index techniques rely on the specific relationship\nbetween refractive index and density, known as the Lorentz-Lorenz formula, which is\nexpressed as follows19.\n$\\frac{n^2-1}{p(n^2+2)} = constant$\nWhere n is the refractive index and p is the density. For gases such as air, where the\nrefractive index is close to unity, this relationship simplifies to the Gladstone-Dale\nequation19.\n$\\frac{n-1}{\u03c1} = constant$\nThe above equation establishes the relationship between the refractive index field and\nthe density field.\nIn measurements, the left side of Eq. (2.6) is recorded as the shadowgraph image.\nBy solving this equation, the refractive index field can be obtained. However, due to\nthe complexity of real problems, the does not have ideal boundary conditions such as\nDirichlet and Neumann conditions, making it difficult to solve using traditional\nnumerical methods. Furthermore, numerical methods can only obtain the solution for\none case at a time and are very time-consuming. These issues motivate this research to\ncombine a novel deep learning method with the traditional shadowgraph technique."}, {"title": "2.2 Physics-Informed Deep Learning Model", "content": "This research is mainly focused on the density field reconstruction based on\nshadowgraph. The reconstruction process can be regarded as a mapping function from\nthe shadowgraph image to the density field.\n$p=F_{map} (I)$\nWhere p is the density field, I is the light intensity field from shadowgraph,\nFmap() is the end-to-end reconstruction mapping function. According to the universal\napproximation theorem20, a neural network NN(\u00b7,\u0398) with parameters @ can be used\nto approximate the super-resolution mapping function Fmap(\u00b7). However, in this study,\nthe neural network model is not constructed in this direct form. The specific\nimplementation details are provided as follows.\nThe simplified equation mentioned in the previous section can be further processed,\nas Eq. (2.1),\n$I_{s, norm} = \\frac{\\partial^2 log n}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 log n}{\\partial y^2}$\nWhere $I_{s,norm} =(I_o-I_i)/(I_o\u00d7L\u00d7D)$ represents the normalized light intensity\ndata. The right-hand side of the equation consists entirely of the second-order derivative\nof the logarithmic refractive index logn. Given the known light intensity Is,norm, the\nrefractive index field can be obtained by solving this Poisson equation. From the\nrefractive index field, the density field can then be derived using the Gladstone-Dale\n(GD) relation. However, solving this Poisson equation is not a typical forward problem,\nas there is no explicit expression for the boundary conditions. This is where PINNs\noffer an advantage in solving inverse problems14.\nPINNs leverage the universal approximation theorem20 of neural networks to\napproximate the solution function of a differential equation, mapping inputs to\ncorresponding outputs. During this training process, the differential equations are\nincorporated into the loss function. Boundary or initial conditions are also included.\nOnce the training converges, the network's predictions satisfy both the differential\nequations and the physical constraints, thereby providing an approximate solution to\nthe original problem.\nThis study develops a physics-informed neural network model based on a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)21, where both the input and output are single-\nchannel tensors. A schematic of the model is shown in Fig. 2. The model adopts an\nencoder-decoder architecture, comprising one encoder and two separate decoders. As\nshown in Fig. 2(a), the encoder is responsible for extracting latent features from the\nnormalized light intensity data. The first decoder, referred to as the Image\nReconstruction (IR) decoder, reconstructs the original image from these features. This\nreconstruction process facilitates the encoder in learning more meaningful\nrepresentations from the input data. As depicted in Fig. 2(b), the second decoder, named\nthe Refractive Index (RI) decoder, reconstructs the refractive index field using the\nfeatures extracted by the trained encoder. This reconstruction is further constrained by\nincorporating physical laws into the training process, ensuring that the resulting\nrefractive index field adheres to the underlying physical principles."}, {"title": "", "content": "For the input tensor $I_{s,norm}$ of the encoder, by subtracting $I_o$, the influence of\ndust on the camera image sensor and vignetting effects are mitigated. Subsequently,\nnormalizing the intensity by dividing $I_o$ eliminates the influence of the light source's\nintensity. Considering that the captured images exhibit brighter and darker regions\ncompared to the background, the results contain both positive and negative values.\nTherefore, a transformation is necessary to map these values within a suitable range for\nprocessing by the neural network. This study directly employs the sigmoid function as\nthe input transformation. This transformation also maintains monotonicity. After the\ntransformation, the tensor fed into the encoder is normalized within the range of 0 to 1.\nIn fact, this operation also enhances the model's generalization performance22.\nFor the output layer, since the refractive index of air is approximately 1.00027, the\nchanges in refractive index due to density variations occur at the order of 104. This\nsmall magnitude is disadvantageous for the neural network's output. Therefore, the\noutput of the RI decoder is transformed to 10\u00b3 logn, ensuring that the output values\nare within a more reasonable range.\nThe implementation of these control equations in neural networks depends on the\nconstruction of partial differential terms. As shown in Fig. 3 and Eq. (2.3), the physical\nloss is calculated with a normalized light intensity field and spatial derivatives of the\nlogarithmic refractive index field."}, {"title": "", "content": "$L_p(\u0398_{RI \\; decoder}) = ||I_{s,norm} - (\\nabla_x^2 log n + \\nabla_y^2 log n)||_2^2$\nWhere L, describes the physical loss of the RI decoder, ORI decoder is the trainable\nparameter of the RI decoder.

The light is then reflected by the first concave mirror, which transforms the\ndiverging rays into a parallel light field. These parallel rays of light travel through the\nexperimental section. The experimental section is located at the center of the optical\npath, where the target device or phenomenon is placed for observation. The second\nconcave mirror gathers the transmitted parallel light and focuses it towards the camera\nsensor, ensuring that any perturbations in the light path-caused by changes in\nrefractive index in the experimental section\u2014are captured with high fidelity.\nThe camera, positioned behind the focal point of the second concave mirror,\nrecords the intensity variations produced by these refractive index changes.

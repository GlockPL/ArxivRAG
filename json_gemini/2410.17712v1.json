As if the transition has introduced challenge issues (1)(2), solar vehicles introduce unique challenges. Research on conventional vehicles has focused on minimizing stored energy use (3), and planning routes based on fuel or charging stations (4). In contrast, solar vehicles generate and consume energy simultaneously during driving, necessitating stable speed policies that consider energy production, consumption, and battery status for long-distance travel. Energy production varies greatly with weather conditions, and consumption changes with the driving environment. However, as noted in (5), little research has been conducted on energy harvesting and power management for long-term solar vehicle driving, which makes it difficult to verify energy changes and reducing driving reliability.\nTo address these issues, we developed a simulator that enables users to indirectly experience driving a solar vehicle and make informed speed decisions. As shown in Figure 1, the simulator calculates expected energy production and consumption based on user-inputted speed, utilizing data on weather, maps, and vehicle specifications for the intended route, and updates the vehicle's status over time. This allows users to verify computed speed policies and observe driving results for their chosen speeds. We validated the simulator using the route of the World Solar Challenge (WSC) in Australia, enabling prior verification of speed policy strategies and emphasizing the importance of energy management in solar vehicles."}, {"title": "2 Related works", "content": "Research on solar vehicles has been ongoing to establish sustainable mobility. Unlike conventional vehicles, solar vehicles simultaneously produce and consume energy, leading to varying driving ranges based on energy management and vehicle components (6). The distance a solar vehicle can travel may vary by up to 2.5 times depending on climate conditions (7), and solar energy production can differ by up to 2.2 times due to temperature variations (8). While many studies have modeled energy production and consumption using physical equations, managing energy consumption considering variable production remains challenging. To address this, methods for predicting energy production or detecting changes in solar irradiance have been proposed, along with energy management strategies based on these predictions (9)(10). However, previous studies have often focused solely on either energy production or consumption, or presented driving policies with specific objectives, limiting a comprehensive understanding of energy variations in solar vehicles.\nSolar vehicle technologies have been demonstrated through solar driving competitions. Simulators that reflect driving conditions and consider energy production and consumption have been developed, proposing optimal driving policies. Yet, they are limited in responding to diverse situations, and policy changes during driving are not easily accommodated (11)(12). Consequently, drivers may struggle with decision-making in unplanned scenarios. If drivers could experience various driving conditions beforehand, they could make rational decisions without hesitation. Additionally, a supporter trained in diverse scenarios could aid in producing positive outcomes. We considered that a simulator with a human interface, where solar vehicle drivers can directly input speed with real-world conditions, would enable users to learn indirectly. Through the data generated from the simulator, we expect to derive the foundation for autonomous solar vehicles capable of optimized driving in various situations."}, {"title": "3 Architecture of the simulator", "content": "To enable drivers and prospective users to empirically experience the unknown characteristics of the vehicle, we developed a simulator based on real environmental data.

By adjusting specifications, users can observe the effects of vehicle weight and solar cells, verifying how different designs affect driving conditions and providing a basis for design insights."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Establishing a driving plan", "content": "The driving plan is created in two stages: a daily average speed plan and, based on it, an hourly speed plan. The simulator uses Beam Search (16) to pre-establish the daily average speed for the route, giving users guidance for solar vehicle driving. Subsequently, users can then set daily driving goals according to the suggested speeds, as shown on the left side of Figure2. Speed input ranges are limited, with increments of 1 km/h.

This route is suitable for analyzing responsiveness to changes in solar irradiance and the impact of speed on long-distance driving.\nWe adhered to the WSC competition's driving conditions: charging is allowed only from 06:30 to 19:00 (operating time), calculated based on GHI data accounting for system losses, and driving is permitted from 08:00 to 17:00 (driving time).\nWe simulated the following strategies to understand solar vehicle operation:\n\u2022 Plan 1 Minimum speed strategy: Prioritizes stability but risks delays and inefficient energy use.\n\u2022 Plan 2 Maximum speed strategy: Maximizes speed but frequent recharging limits efficiency.\n\u2022 Plan 3 Average speed strategy: Maintains a steady speed, assuming ample energy availability.\n\u2022 Plan 4 Daily average speed strategy: Adjusts speed daily based on solar conditions for optimal energy use.\n\u2022 Plan 5: SoC maintenance strategy: Balances speed and energy to keep the battery charge within an optimal range.\nEach strategy was simulated over the entire route using identical initial conditions and environmental data for comparison."}, {"title": "5 Results", "content": "Table 1 presents the daily driving distances for the five strategies. Under the same weather conditions and route, the Daily Average Speed Strategy resulted in the longest total distance covered. The second fastest arrival was achieved with the Average Speed Strategy. Driving at maximum speed with repeated charging and discharging led to the latest arrival. Although the Minimum Speed Strategy was slower, it resulted in a faster arrival than the maximum speed approach. Using the SoC Maintenance Strategy, the vehicle reached the destination over six days, arriving faster than with the minimum and maximum speed strategies. These results confirm that speed policies significantly impact solar vehicle driving, and drivers can establish and evaluate optimal strategies using the simulator. Figure 4 shows the hourly driving speeds for each strategy. In the Minimum Speed, Daily Average Speed, and Average Speed strategies, the vehicle's speed remains constant during the day's driving, allowing continuous travel without stops.\nOn Day 5, the daily average speed was higher than the overall route average speed due to a decrease in maximum environmental temperature from 29\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C when moving from Coober Pedy to Adelaide, increasing energy production efficiency by 2% (Table 2). On other days, the speeds were similar to or lower than the overall route average speed. When driving at maximum speed, the maximum continuous driving time was 3 hours, varying with region and weather conditions. With the SoC Maintenance Strategy, no battery overload occurred, allowing efficient energy use. However, as it has a speed variance from 30km/h to 85km/h, it could cause driver fatigue with changing speed."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "By applying real driving routes and weather data, our simulator demonstrated how solar vehicles' driving range and speed policies change under various scenarios. This lets drivers predict energy states before driving and make appropriate speed decisions, facilitating thoughtful driving strategies. Additionally, it allows evaluation of the vehicle's design by changing the vehicle's specifications. While the simulator aims to provide results close to actual conditions, limitations exist, such as not incorporating real-time weather information and not reflecting urban shadow effects. Future research will enhance accuracy by integrating real-time data and additional spatial information.\nNevertheless, our simulator reliably imports data for various routes and credible weather information to calculate energy consumption similar to actual driving. This allows users to confirm solar vehicle driving results and deepen their understanding of energy management. Additionally, data generated by the simulator can serve as a foundation for advancing from traditional physical dynamics to AI, enabling developments like generating optimal speed policies for solar vehicles and creating dedicated support systems for solar driving."}]}

Previous signal attacks against LiDAR systems mainly exploit laser signals. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., injecting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) to manipulate LiDAR output. Our insight is that the internal modules of a LiDAR, i.e., the laser receiving circuit, the monitoring sensors, and the beam-steering modules, even with strict electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, can still couple with the IEMI attack signals and result in the malfunction of LiDAR systems.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Autonomous systems empowered by artificial intelligence are having a transformative impact on our society. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), which directly measures the coordinates and shapes of objects with precision, has been increasingly integrated into various applications such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), drones, and robots. According to Yole [38], more than 119 car models are to be released with LiDAR by OEMs all over the world in 2023 or shortly thereafter.\nLiDAR plays a critical role in autonomous vehicles to perceive surrounding environments and make intelligent decisions. The safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles highly depend on the trustworthiness of the LiDAR perception. A critical question is how safe LiDAR systems are facing surrounding physical signals. Numerous studies [55], [70], [19], [43], [31], [18] indicate that LiDAR can be compromised by lasers. However, with lasers operating on the same physical channel, attacks typically target the photoelectric sensor in the ToF circuit, and the attack principle focuses on the transduction process. To explore a more expansive set of attack vectors besides the laser signals, we propose and investigate the possibility of the cross-modality signal attacks. A recent work [17] demonstrates that EMI can compromise LiDAR'S ToF circuits and induce attack effects of \"sensor data perturbations\". Overall, all previous works compromise LiDAR by attacking the circuits or photoelectric sensor in ToF module. Whether there are new vulnerabilities and new attack surfaces against lidar systems remains an open question.\nIn this paper, our goal is to explore novel attack vulnerabilities and new attack vectors for compromising LiDAR using IEMI. The challenge of achieving this goal is considerable for two reasons: (1) Exploiting novel attack vulnerabilities proves difficult owing to the robust encapsulation and tamper-proof features of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LiDAR systems, which conceal their internal mechanics and complicate the analysis of underlying principles. (2) LiDAR systems typically exhibit resistance to IEMI due to rigorous Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing and the incorporation of anti-interference designs, such as shielding and layout optimization, which mitigate IEMI effects.\nTo tackle these challenges, we systematically analyze the LiDAR's internal architectures by referring to reverse engineering reports [37], [74] and infer that the monitoring sensors (e.g., temperature sensors [77],hall effect sensors [80]) and the beam-steering module can be good candidates to couple with EMI signals. Then, we establish a set of high-performance EM attack devices with a broad frequency range to experimentally search for vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we identify attack surfaces by utilizing the fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) mechanism and conducting validation experiments on LiDAR's internal circuits. Through these steps, we discovered two new attack surfaces: monitoring sensors (temperature sensors and hall effect sensors) and the optical encoder in beam steering module. Based on this, we can achieve novel attack effects such as points removal and LiDAR power-off.\nFurthermore, to explore the feasibility of skillfully manipulating LiDAR systems using EM signals for precise control, we experiment with injecting controllable points into the LiDAR system. Previous efforts [55], [70], [19], [43], [31], [18] in this domain typically involved using lasers which forge LiDAR echoes to inject controllable points. However, directly employing the same method with EM signals to forge LiDAR echoes faces the challenge of signal coupling into the circuit. To overcome this challenge, we utilize amplitude modulation (AM). We identified an appropriate carrier frequency and modulated the fine-grained baseband signal onto the sinusoidal carrier signal, thereby achieving effective signal injection. Through this method, we successfully managed to inject controllable points using EM signals. In this paper, only the points injection attack requires signal amplitude modulation.\nIn general, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we successfully implemented four types of attacks: 1) Points Interference. By injecting EMI into laser receiving ciruit, we can introduce errors (up to 10cm in this paper) in LiDAR ranging, thereby distorting the point cloud. 2) Points Removal: By injecting EMI into monitoring sensors or laser receiving ciruit, this attack causes the point cloud to deviate significantly from its true position or to disappear completely. The effect can be applied to part or all of the point cloud. 3) LiDAR Power-off: By injecting EMI into beam steeing module, this attack causes the LiDAR system to shut down and stop working. Even after the attack stops, the LiDAR system must be manually rebooted before it can resume operation. 4) Points Injection: By injecting amplitude-modulated EMI into laser receiving ciruit, this attack allows for the injection of controllable points.\nAmong these, Points Removal, LiDAR Power-off and Points Injection are three new attacks. Additionally, the Points Interference attack enhances the attack capability established in previous work [17]. We hope that the increased types of attack effects and enhanced attack capabilities can help the security community and LiDAR manufacturers accurately recognize the threats posed by EMI to LiDAR systems. This recognition should further promote the establishment of more advanced EMC standards and the design of more secure LiDAR systems.\nTo evaluate the PhantomLiDAR attacks, we explore the IEMI vulnerability on five COTS LiDAR systems including three rotating LiDARs and two MEMS LiDARs. To better understand the advantages and limitations of the four types of attacks, we designed unique evaluation methods for each. We evaluate the attack in both emulated and real-world setups on five 3D object detection models, considering the impacts of attackers' location and aiming. Notably, we validate that PhantomLiDAR can hide a targeted object even when the attack distance is 5 meters away. In addition, PhantomLiDAR can inject over 16,000 fake points in the VLP-16 LiDAR, a quantity that is five times greater than that achieved by SOTA laser-based attacks [43], which could inject less than 3,000 fake points in the VLP-16 under the same rotation speed. What's more, we conduct feasibility experiments in moving scenarios.\nWe summarize our main contributions as follows:\n*   Attack Surfaces: As far as we know, we are the first to propose the attack surfaces of monitoring sensors and optical encoder in beam-steering module on LiDAR.\n*   Attack Effects: We propose three new attack effects including Points Removal, LiDAR Power-off, and Points Injection.\n*   Attack Capabilities: The Points Interference show 2x stronger interference capability compared to SOTA works. The Points Removal can hide a target remotely without precise aiming. The LiDAR Power-off can success on popular mehchanical LiDAR VLP-16 and MEMS LIDAR RS-M1. Points Injection can inject controllable points number 5x more than SOTA laser-based attacks.\n*   Experiments: We conducted experiments on five COTS LIDAR systems. For the four types of attacks, we designed specific simulated and real-world experiments to better evaluate their effectiveness and limitations."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "A. LiDAR System\nLiDAR provides precise 3D spatial information through point cloud data. Fig. 2 illustrates the main components of a typical lidar, which include an emitter-receiver pair (or pairs). During a ranging process, the main board controls the emitter to emit the laser signal, and its direction and firing time To are registered. The laser pulse travels through air, and when it hits an object, a portion of that energy is reflected and received by the paired receiver. The light signal is then converted into an analog electrical signal through a photoelectric sensor. After passing through an amplifier, filter, and ADC, the analog signal is transformed into a digital signal that is input into the FPGA. The algorithms within the FPGA can determine the receiving time 71 and intensity of the echo signal. The range R is measured based on the round-trip delay of light to the target:\n$R = \\frac{1}{2} c \\cdot (\\tau_1 - \\tau_0)$\nwhere c is the speed of light in the medium (e.g., air) between the LiDAR and the target. This process is called Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging. Based on this equation, the lidar-based range measurement is equivalent to measuring the round-trip delay of light waves to the target. This is achieved by modulating the intensity, phase, and/or frequency of the waveform of the transmitted light and measuring the time required for that modulation pattern to appear back at the receiver."}, {"title": "B. LiDAR Fault Detection and Diagnostic", "content": "To ensure that the LiDAR operates as intended, the LiDAR manufacturers typically utilizes fault detection and diagnostic (FDD) [15], [30] mechanisms to ensure these modules function as intended. If a LiDAR system fails to operate as expected, it could potentially cause damage. For instance, excessive laser emission power or a motor malfunction leading to continuous laser exposure on a single spot could pose risks to the eyes. Therefore, for the protection of both people and the LiDAR system itself, FDD and response mechanisms are often integrated into the design of the LiDAR.\nAccording to the patents released by LiDAR and car manufactures [33], [59], [49], manufacturers categorize common LiDAR faults and classify them based on severity and consequences into two levels: Level 1 (L1) faults are those with lower impact. The LiDAR can continue to operate under L1 faults but with reduced performance or parameters; Level 2 (L2) faults are more severe, which either render the LiDAR inoperable or lead to performance degradation beyond acceptable limits. The LiDAR may shut down when the L2 faults are diagnosed. As shown in Fig. 3, there are four typical states during LiDAR operation: Initialization, Normal, Warning, and Power-off. A LiDAR system may alternate among the four operational states when faults are detected. When a LiDAR powers on, it first enters Initialization and performs self-check. Then the LiDAR activates the motor, and once the motor speed has reached the preset value and the self-check is passed, it enters the Normal operating state. In the Normal state, the LiDAR periodically performs self-check. If an L1 fault is detected during the Initialization or Normal states, the LiDAR enters the Warning state. If an L2 fault is detected at any state, the LiDAR will enter the Power-off state, where it typically shuts down power or communication.\nA typical FDD list from an anonymous LiDAR manufacturer is shown in Table. IV in the Appendix. It should be noted that different LiDAR manufacturers may have their own definitions for diagnosing and managing faults in LiDAR systems."}, {"title": "C. Backgroud of IEMI Attacks", "content": "The IEMI term is officially defined by the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) as \"intentional malicious generation of electromagnetic energy introducing noise or signals into electric and electronic systems, thus disrupting, confusing, or damaging these systems for terrorist or criminal purposes\" [56]. The adversary should first consider possible ways to couple the IEMI signals into the target to implement a successful IEMI attack. We refer to this process as constructing the coupling channel, and there are three essential components for a coupling channel:\nAttack Surfaces is a \"wire\" that exists in the victim circuit that acts as an unintentional receiving antenna to be interfered with by the malicious IEMI signals. This kind of \"wire\" can be analog electrical traces on the printed circuit boards (PCB) [45], [23], [75], [41], [46], [82], [27] or the digital sensory communication channel between the sensor and controller [40], [39].\nCoupling Path decides how the IEMI generated by attackers reaches the victim device. The selection of coupling paths largely depends on the target coupling interface to achieve the best coupling efficiency. There are two categories of coupling paths: radiated and conducted. Radiated coupling propagates electromagnetic energy through the air or vacuum without making any physical contact with the target, such as magnetic coupling (changing magnetic fields (H-fields)), electrical coupling (changing electric fields (E-fields)), and electromagnetic coupling (changing both magnetic and electric fields (EM-fields)). Conducted coupling propagates electromagnetic energy from an electromagnetic source to a coupling interface via wire conduction [85].\nIEMI Sources. To deliver the IEMI signals into target systems efficiently, attackers need to generate IEMI signals at frequencies that are compatible with the electrical characteristics of the target systems and at suitable amplitudes that can change system data in the desired manner."}, {"title": "III. THREAT MODEL", "content": "A. Attack Goal\nThe attacker's goal is to diminish the reliability and performance of LiDAR systems by stealthily interfering with the point cloud or LiDAR operating status using EM signals. Specifically, we consider 4 types of attacks:\n*   Points Interference: The goal of this attack is to introduce errors in the distance measurement of the LiDAR.\n*   Points Removal: The goal here is to significantly displace the point cloud of an object from its actual position or to completely erase it, consequently preventing the LiDAR-based perception models from detecting the object.\n*   LiDAR Power-off: The effect of this attack is to shut down the LiDAR, rendering it inoperative. Even after the attack stops, the LiDAR requires a reboot to resume functioning.\n*   Points Injection: This attack focuses on injecting false points with controllable positions and patterns.\nB. Attacker's Capability\nWe consider the attacker with the following assumptions.\nEM Attack Capability to the LiDAR. The attacker can transmit EM signals to the LiDAR in the victim autonomous cars or robots remotely without attaching any hardware or software on the target LiDAR systems. To achive it, we assume the attacker is equipped with commercial devices that can generate EM signals including an RF antenna, a signal generator and an RF power amplifier. The attack devices can be set up in the attacker's car, allowing the attacker to follow the victim vehicle and conduct EM injection attacks within a certain distance. They can also park on the roadside to attack passing vehicles or those stopped at red lights.\nBudget-related Considerations. Attackers may require high-end devices to perform wide-frequency range sweeps in order to identify the vulnerabilities of LiDAR systems. Once these vulnerabilities are identified, lower-cost attack devices can be used to carry out the attack.\nLiDAR Parameter Awareness. We assume the attacker knows the model of the target LiDAR, and she may obtain a similar substitute LiDAR for assessment beforehand. For example, she may implement frequncy sweep experiments on the substitude LiDAR to find a vulnerability frequency offline before officially implement attack.\nBlack Box. The adversary does not have access to the machine learning model or the perception system. Attackers can exploit only the characteristics and vulnerabilities of the sensors to achieve their attack target."}, {"title": "IV. PRELIMINARY STUDY: FEASIBILITY AND VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS", "content": "In this section, we first investigate the feasibility of efficient electromagnetic injection and its potential attack effects on LiDAR systems. Subsequently, we analyze the principle of various attack effects.\nA. Attack Intuition\nThere are two attacks intuitions can be formulated that can potentially compromise LiDAR: direct attack and indirect attack.\nDirect Attack: From Sec. II-A, we learned that a LiDAR point is generated by a ToF ranging process, in which a laser signal is converted into an analog electrical signal by a photodetector in the receiving circuit. Therefore, a direct way to compromise the point cloud is to interfer with the analog signal in the receiving module, directly affecting the LiDAR's ranging mechanism and subsequently disrupting the point cloud.\nIndirect Attack: From Sec. II-B and Table. IV, we learned that when the FDD mechanism of a LiDAR detects a fault, the LiDAR enters an abnormal self-protection status, in which it may treat the point cloud as invalid or even shut down. Therefore, it may be feasible to compromise other modules in LiDAR, e.g., temperature sensors [77], power supplies[80], and optical encoder in the beam-steering unit [71]. This may induce the LiDAR to detect errors, triggering the FDD's inherent operations, forcing the LiDAR into fault recovery, and thereby leading to denial of service or even shut down.\nB. Feasibility of IEMI attack on LiDAR\nWhen we attempt to inject EM signals to compromise a LiDAR, we consider the LiDAR's analog electrical traces on the PCB and the electric wire as receiving antennas. The frequency of the EM signal determines the efficiency of its reception by a specific antenna. Theoretically, we can estimate the resonant frequency where the maximum coupling efficiency occurs based on the length and shape of the targeted/selected antenna [58]. However, accurately calculating the signal frequency is challenging due to the unknown nature of the target antenna in LiDAR. To address this challenge, one of the most commonly used methods is frequency sweep.\n1) Setup: The experimental setup for the feasibility study is shown in Fig. 4. The attack devices include a Keysight N5712b vector signal generator for EMI signal generation, a Mini-Circuits HPA-50W-63+ power amplifier for amplifying the EMI signal, and a log-periodic antenna for signal transmission. The LiDARs under test is the VLP-16 [78], which is the most popular LiDAR in related work [70], [19], [43], [17].\nWe conduct frequency sweep ranging from 500 MHz to 3500 MHz with an interval of 1 MHz. The signal generator output is set at 0 dbm with an amplifier gain of 50 W. The video demo of the frequency sweep can be found on the website [16]. We record the point cloud and observe the running status of LiDAR under EMI at various frequencies. Both quantitative calculation and attack effects analysis are employed to present the results of the frequency sweep.\n2) Quantitative Analysis: In the quantitative analysis, we utilize the parameter Hausdoff distance [35] between the benign point cloud and the interfered point cloud to quantify the level of distortion for point clouds under IEMI. In mathematics, the Hausdoff distance measures how far two subsets of a metric space are from each other. Consider the benign point cloud PC and the interfered point cloud PC', the Hausdorff distance between them is denoted as DH (PC, PC'). A larger value of DH (PC, PC') indicates a stronger degree of interference by IEMI on the LiDAR system. During the sweep process, apart from the varying frequency of the EM signal, we strive to maintain a consistent laboratory environment. After recording the point clouds during frequency sweep, we calculate the Hausdorff distance between point clouds at each frequency ranging from 500 MHz to 3500 MHz and the benign point cloud. The results, as shown in Fig. 5(a), reveal that many different frequencies can cause significant interference effects. For instance, at frequencies around 1200 MHz, the Hausdorff distance reaches as high as 120 meters. Observing the point cloud under 1200 MHz EMI, we find that all points have been erased. In summary, the quantitative analysis of frequency sweep validates the feasibility of EMI attacks on LiDAR.\nHowever, to systematically investigate the principles of these attacks, we also need to focus on the effects of the attacks.\n3) Attack Effects Analysis: From quantitative analysis, it can be observed that signals of different frequencies can cause varying degrees of interference with LiDAR point clouds. To systematically analyze the principles of attacks, we categorize them based on the extent of interference in the point clouds under EMI and the changes in the operational state of the LiDAR. The attack effects are intuitively categorized as Points Interference, Points Removal, and LiDAR Poweroff. The results of attack effect analysis on VLP-16 are presented in Fig. 5(b).\nThe criteria for categorising attack effects are presented below. In a static environment, we measure the Euclidean distance between points on the same ray before and after an attack. If the average Euclidean distance is less than 2 cm, we consider the LiDAR unaffected by Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), given that the inherent range accuracy of LiDAR is 2 cm. If the average Euclidean distance is greater than 2 cm but less than 1 m, we define this type of attack effect as Points Interference. Should the average Euclidean distance exceed 1 m, it implies that the points have been displaced from their original positions, leading us to categorize this effect as Points Reomval. Points Removal can affect either part or all of the point cloud. Furthermore, we find that when the electromagnetic frequency is swept to 1040 ~ 1070 MHz, the VLP-16 LiDAR system shuts down completely and fails to recover even after cessation of the EM attack. The system must be rebooted to resume operation. This type of attack effect is categorized as LiDAR Power-off."}, {"title": "C. Principle Analysis and Validation", "content": "We analyze and validate the principle of the aforementioned three types of attack effects in this section.\n1) Why Points Interference Can be Induced:\nPrinciple Analysis for Point Interference: We propose that the direct attack is the primary principle of point interference. As detailed in Sec. II-A, a benign LiDAR signal is typically a laser pulse. When the LiDAR emits a laser pulse, its time-of-shooting and direction are registered. The laser pulse travels through the air until it hits an obstacle which reflects some of the energy, which is returned laser pulse. The distance of the object is calculated by measuring the time interval, so-called time of flight, between the emitted and the returned laser pulse. The time of acquisition is acquired according to the peak of the laser pulse. The point interference principle is illustrated in Fig. 6(a), the EMI can introduce noise into the benign signal by coupling the interfering signal into the wires between the transducer and amplifier. The interfering signal, when superimposed on the benign signal, alters the peak of the echo signal, thereby affecting the LiDAR's ranging. Besides, as shown in Fig. 6(b), we have also observed that when we slightly change the frequency, the interfering patterns will change significantly. This phenomenon is because the injected EM signal approaches or exceeds 1 GHz, and the sample rate of VLP-16's ADC is only 500 MHz, undersampling can lead to aliasing. This results in minor frequency changes altering the interference pattern, a phenomenon that has also been discovered in a concurrent prior work [17]. In our study, owing to the use of different frequencies and powerful devices, we can induce a distance error of up to 10 cm as illustrated in Fig. 6(b), compared to the 4 cm error reported in the prior work [17].\nPrinciple Validation for Point Interference: To validate that the signal could couple into the LiDAR's receiver, we disassembled the LiDAR and extracted its receiving module. We then emitted a 990MHz EM signal towards the receiving module, a frequency capable of causing point interference. We observed that electromagnetic interference was indeed coupled into the transmission line of the receiving board as shown in Fig. 6(c).\n2) Why Points Removal can be Induced:\nPrinciple Analysis for Points Removal: We propose direct attack and indirect attack are both potential principles to induce Points Removal.\n*   Attack principle 1 (direct attack): if we can inject high-amplitude EM signal into receiving circuit, it may saturate the receiving circuit and make the real laser pulse undetectable.\n*   Attack principle 2 (indirect attack): if we can compromise temperature sensor or hall effect sensor, it may induce LiDAR to detect L1 fault, leading LiDAR to consider some or all of the points as invalid.\nPrinciple Validation for Points Removal: We validate the two principles through the Hypothetico-deductive method. If Principle 1 (direct attack) is correct, then when observing Points Removal at a certain signal strength and gradually reducing the signal strength, we should observe a gradual recovery of the removed point cloud due to the decreasing amplitude of interference signals coupled to the receiving circuit. If Principle 2 is correct, then when gradually reducing the signal strength to a certain value, a sudden recovery of the point cloud will be observed because at this point, the FDD mechanism no longer detects errors. Experimental evidence demonstrates that at certain frequencies, such as 1.1 GHz, we can indeed observe the gradual recovery of the removed point cloud, confirming that Principle 1 is correct at this frequency. However, at certain frequencies, such as 1.2 GHz, as the EM amplitude decreases, we observe a sudden recovery of the point cloud, indicating that at this frequency, Principle 2 is correct.\nIn addition to the Hypothetico-deductive method, we further validate the Principle 2 by directly observing the readings of the monitoring sensor through the fault diagnostic interface. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the diagnostic information can be viewed through the fault diagnostic interface of VLP-16. We find that when EMI causes the points removed, some readings in the diagnostic interface exhibit anomalies. First, as shown in Fig. 7(b), the temperature sensor readings, which should be around 40 Celsius degree, fluctuate between -200 and 150 degrees. Second, some voltage rail readings deviate from normal values. We highly recommend readers to watch the demo video of fault diagnostic when Points Removal occurs on the website [16].\n3) Why LiDAR Power-off can be Induced:\nPrinciple Analysis for LiDAR Power-off: When EMI causes the LiDAR to power off, and we subsequently stop the attack and reboot the LiDAR, it still operates normally. Therefore, it is clear that we are not causing the LiDAR to power off by damaging the hardware. From Sec. II-B and Fig. 3, we learned that the LiDAR may be forced to shut down when it encounters recoverable severe errors. Therefore, we propose that the indirect attack is the principle of LiDAR Power-off. Specifically, the LiDAR Power-off is triggered by interfering the LiDAR's beam steering module.\nPrinciple Validation for LiDAR Power-off: We utilize Wireshark to record communication data of VLP-16 from the onset of the EM attack until the LiDAR shuts down. We find that in addition to some faults that also occurred during Points Removal, the LiDAR's rotation speed exhibited severe anomalies. As shown in Fig. 8(a), despite being preset to 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), the speed will drop to 19 RPM, a reduction of 96.7%. Based on our analysis above, such a drastic reduction in speed constitutes a severe fault, highly likely to cause the LiDAR to report an L2 fault and enter the power-off state. We further investigate which part of the beam steering module was disrupted by the EM signal. As shown in Fig. 20, upon disassembling the LiDAR, we discovered that the VLP-16's beam steering module is a rotating motor monitored by an optical encoder AEDR-850X. As shown in Fig. 8(b), we attacks an AEDR-850X with sinusoidal EM signals of 1050 MHz, which is the EM frequency inducing LiDAR Power-off. The test result reveals that EM signals can interfere with the data perceived by the optical encoder, which probably leads the LiDAR to erroneously detect an abnormally low motor speed, thereby causing a power-off."}, {"title": "V. CONTROLLABLE POINT INJECTION DESIGN", "content": "In this section, we focus on how to inject and precisely manipulate fake (legitimate but erroneous) points with EMI against LiDAR systems. To execute a controllable point injection attack, it is crucial to address the following questions:\n*   Q1. How to effectively inject EM signal?\n*   Q2. How to inject fake points?\n*   Q3. How to control fake points?\nFor Q1, based on the preliminary study in Sec. IV, the most direct method for precise point cloud manipulation is to inject EM signals into the Time-of-Flight (ToF) circuit, rather than through fault management mechanisms to affect the point cloud. Therefore, the principle of Points Interference attacks can be utilized, which is manipulating echo signal of LiDAR to control points. In addition, we investigate the factors that influencing the effectiveness and efficiency of EM injection, including the frequency and amplititude of carrier signals and the types of antenna in different attack distances. Our goal is to identify the optimal conditions for these factors which, when combined, can achieve the maximum intensity of EM injection.\nFor Q2, the fake points can be injected by forging laser signal echoes. However, unlike the direct forgery of signals in laser attacks [43], [19], [70], the transmission and coupling of pulse-shaped electromagnetic waves encounter significant attenuation and distortion. Therefore, we employ signal amplitude modulation (AM), using the designed laser pulse signal as the baseband signal, modulated onto a sinusoidal carrier signal of a resonant frequency.\nFor Q3, we reference methods from laser-based attack [43], using photoelectric sensors to detect the operational status of LiDAR systems, then set a precise delay to control the timing of EM signal emission, ultimately achieving control over the point cloud.\nThe workflow of controllable points injection is shown in Fig. 9. The Efficient EM Injection module identify the optimal conditions for carrier signal and transmission which, when combined, can achieve the maximum intensity of EM injection. The Effective Point Injection Module models the LiDAR parameters and design baseband signal that can inject points. The Point Control module introduces a closed-loop feedback mechanism integrating receive and delay control.\nA. Efficient EM Injection\nWe utilize a sinusoidal EM signal as the carrier wave. The stronger the intensity of the EM injection, the more likely the forged echo signal is to be perceived as a valid echo, thereby increasing the success rate of fake points injection. Consequently, we are motivated to study the main factors that affect the effectiveness and efficiency of EM injection.\n1) Carrier Signal Search: The coupling efficiency between a victim circuit and an EM signal is determined by the frequency and amplitude of the EM signal.\nFrequency. When conducting IEMI attacks, we consider the wires in the victim LiDAR system as receiving antennas. The effective EM signal frequency can be estimated based on the electrical length of the targeted/selected antenna [58], [79]. Empirically, if the length of the targeted antenna is l, the optimal coupling frequency of the EM signal lies between $\\frac{c}{5l}$ and $\\frac{c}{2l}$, where c is the light speed. The specific optimal coupling frequency also depends on the shape, material, and other characteristics of the targeted antenna. In realistic attack scenarios, attackers can utilize the aforementioned theory to establish an approximate frequency range and subsequently identify the resonant frequency with higher coupling efficiency through frequency sweep.\nAmplititude. The amplitude is a critical factor in EMI, it is generally considered that higher signal amplitude results in stronger interference. In practical experiments, there may be instances where increasing the device's displayed amplitude does not enhance interference. For example, in our experiments, the signal generator's maximum amplitude is 19 dBm (80 mW), and the amplifier is 50 W. However, we observed that changing the signal generator's amplitude (e.g., from 10 dBm to 19 dBm) sometimes does not affect the final output. This is due to the saturation characteristics of the amplifier, which limits the maximum output strength of the signal.\n2) EM Signal Transmission: Firstly, the frequency range of the antenna must cover the range of the sweep. Secondly, it is advantageous for the antenna to have as high a gain as possible to reduce signal attenuation. In our experiments, to accommodate various attack distances, we selected two types of transmission antennas. For attack distances less than 10 cm, we choose a near-field probe to generate the EM signal due to its greater portability. For attack distances greater than 10 cm, we opt for a log-periodic antenna due to its superior directionality.\nB. Effective Point Injection\nWe inject fake points by forging LiDAR signal echoes. Firstly, we model the LiDAR system, then design the pulsed signal based on the points we intend to inject. Finally, we modulate the pulsed signal onto a sinusoidal carrier signal.\n1) LiDAR Modeling: For the target victim LiDAR, we need to acquire the necessary information to guide signal design. First, we must obtain its signal waveform, typically consisting of one or multiple pulses. For instance, the signal of VLP-16 is a pulse with a width of about 10 ns. Then, we need to determine the LiDAR's scanning cycle, which is usually available in the data manual. For example, the VLP-16 operates on a cycle of 55.296 \u00b5s, during which 16 laser lines are emitted and received at intervals of 2.304 \u00b5s in a specific sequence, followed by a recharge period of 18.432 \u03bc\u03b5.\n2) Baseband Signal Design: The design process of the attack signal involves converting the intended point cloud into a series of pulses, where each pulse corresponds to a spoofing point, and the timing of each pulse's peak defines the spatial coordinates of the spoofing point. The method for designing the baseband signal is akin to that used in previous laser-based attacks [43]. However, using the baseband signal directly is ineffective for injecting the signal into LiDAR systems through EMI. Therefore, we use the attack signal as the baseband signal and modulate it onto a carrier signal using amplitude modulation (AM) to enable effective injection.\nC. Point Control\nWith the AM-modulated EM pulses, we can inject spoofing points into the LiDAR. However, However, these spoofing points are disorganized and cannot be stabilized in a fixed pattern and position, as shown in Fig. 21 in Appendix. To achieve controllable injection, it is necessary to synchronize the signal with the LiDAR's scanning sequence. Inspired by previous laser-based attack [43], We introduce an integrated receive-delay-fire closed-loop feedback mechanism for point cloud control. we utilize a photoelectric sensor to detect the operational cycle of the LiDAR and adopt the delay control function in signal generator to achieve synchronization."}, {"title": "VI.

This architecture integrates the resources of cloud computing, edge computing and terminal computing to achieve efficient resource scheduling and secure and reliable data transmission, thereby supporting the needs of various complex application scenarios [1], such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, smart cities and industrial automation.\nSpecifically, the workflow of the cloud-edge-end collaborative architecture may include the following links: 1. Data collection: terminal devices and sensors are responsible for collecting various data, such as environmental parameters, user behavior, etc. 2. Edge processing: The edge device performs preliminary processing and analysis on the collected data to reduce the computing pressure on the cloud and reduce the delay of data transmission. 3. Cloud computing: The cloud server receives data from the edge, performs more in-depth analysis and calculation, and generates valuable insights and decision support. In some scenarios, the cloud is mainly used to store and manage user data. 4. Collaborative work: The cloud, edge, and terminal can achieve collaborative work and resource sharing through efficient communication protocols and data exchange mechanisms.\nThe advantage of the cloud-edge-end collaborative architecture is that it can make full use of various computing resources, improve the overall performance and response speed of the system, and reduce the cost and risk of data transmission.

Users can choose multiple voices to communicate in the conversation, achieving a seamless conversation experience. Gemini Live pays special attention to the free flow of conversation, allowing users to interrupt while the other party is speaking. This design allows users to interrupt or pause at any time in the conversation, which is very suitable for scenarios that require multitasking. Even when the phone is locked, Gemini Live can work in the background to ensure that users can get information at any time.\nThe engineering implementation of Gemini Live involves multiple technical fields. By representing multimodal inputs as sequence tokens for processing, the input modules are different, and the unified representation module in the middle can be shared. We can draw inspiration from the architectures of llava and Qwen-audio. The input does not require OCR text recognition tools or speech recognition tools, and can achieve end-to-end understanding output. They process the input signal through ViT and audio encoding modules, and the subsequent decoders can be based on the llama3 model.\nQuestion: What challenges arise when extracting specific data tables from documents, and how can they be overcome?\nIn document management, accurately locating the location of multiple tables and their pages is the first step, which is crucial for subsequent data processing and analysis.

On the one hand, the commercialization process of brain-computer interface technology is quietly emerging. It has revolutionized the seamless connection between the human brain and advanced external devices, opening up an unprecedented path for the instant transmission and fine control of information.

Attention mechanism: The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer model is a simplified simulation of the brain's efficient information processing strategy. When faced with complex information, the brain can quickly lock on to key information and ignore redundant details, a highly selective attention allocation mechanism.\n2. Memory mechanism: The human brain has a complex and sophisticated memory system, including short-term memory and long-term memory, as well as an efficient memory storage and retrieval mechanism. This biological characteristic provides valuable inspiration for the model architecture in memory processing. By drawing on the brain's memory mechanism.\n3. Multi-brain region collaborative information processing paradigm: Human cognitive functions do not exist in isolation, but rely on close collaboration and information exchange between multiple brain regions to form brain region loops and brain networks for cognitive functions. This multi-brain region collaborative mechanism helps the model's design ideas when building complex information processing systems. By simulating the functional division of labor and synergy of different brain regions, more complex cognitive tasks can be achieved.\n4. Dynamic system perspective of brain-like mechanism: As a highly dynamic system, the internal mechanism of the brain is far beyond the scope of simple electrical signal transmission. Complex phenomena such as the formation and forgetting of memories, the fluctuation and regulation of emotions, etc. often involve complex reactions and regulation of chemical substances. This perspective prompts us to not only focus on the optimization of the computational level when designing the Transformer model, but also explore how to introduce more diversified mechanisms"}]}

{"title": "The Einstein Test: Towards a Practical Test of a Machine's Ability to Exhibit\n\"Superintelligence\"", "authors": ["David Benrimoh", "Nace Mikus", "Ariel Rosenfeld"], "abstract": "Creative and disruptive insights (CDIs), such as the development of the theory of relativity, have\npunctuated human history, marking pivotal shifts in our species' intellectual trajectory. Recent\nadvancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked debates over whether state-of-the-art\nmodels possess the capacity to generate CDIs. We argue that the ability to create CDIs should\nbe regarded as a significant feature of machine superintelligence (SI).To this end, we propose a\npractical test to evaluate whether an approach to Al targeting SI can yield novel insights of this\nkind. We propose the \u201cEinstein test\u201d: given the data available prior to the emergence of a known\nCDI, can an Al independently reproduce that insight (or one that is formally equivalent)? By\nachieving such a milestone, a machine can be considered to at least match humanity's past top\nintellectual achievements- and therefore to have the potential to surpass them.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Current advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are proceeding at an unprecedented pace. The\nspeed of this progress has prompted some to declare that not only will Als match human\nintelligence in most or all domains in short order (which remains a controversial claim\u00b9), but that\nthey will soon far exceed human intelligence in every domain, reaching a form of so-called\nsuperintelligence, or SI2,3. Clearly, the impact of SI on human society would be profound. Sls\ncould theoretically revolutionize everything from medicine to governance; and they could\npotentially solve problems, such as the reconciliation of relativity with quantum theory, which\nhave eluded humans thus far. The philosophical implications of this are fascinating it is evident\nthat many companies and researchers are optimistic about the benefits of SI and are actively\npursuing its development, committing considerable financial, intellectual, and material\nresources in this effort. At the same time, a true SI could create a disproportionate\nconcentration of power in the hands of those who control it, and further exacerbate inequality\nand geopolitical instability7,8. Given how societies struggle to adapt to rapid technology changes,\nit is imperative to establish rigorous benchmarking systems to detect, evaluate, and regulate SI\ndevelopment.\nSuch benchmarks would serve a role similar to the ARC-AGI dataset in the quest for artificial\ngeneral intelligence. However, there are challenges in determining whether an Al is likely to\ndevelop SI. Specifically, we lack particular milestones that are expected to be achieved on the\nroad to SI. Clearly, SI would surpass human intelligence, but identifying how and when this has\noccurred is far from straightforward. This complexity stems from two major issues: the lack of\nconsensus on how to define and measure human intelligence, and the absence of a formal\nframework for determining when an Al has exceeded human capabilities across most domains.\nSome might argue that we will \u201cknow an SI when we see it\u201d, but this assumption is fraught with\nuncertainty. Without benchmarks or milestones, it may not be clear whether an Al has the\npotential to achieve SI until it already has. This ambiguity underscores the central challenge\naddressed in this article: defining a practical test that SI machines- or those likely to develop SI-\nmay be expected to pass."}, {"title": "Creative and Disruptive Insights", "content": "We approach this challenge by considering \u201cCreative and Disruptive Insights\u201d (CDIs). These\nare, essentially, the kinds of insights that, prior to the development of machine intelligence, we\nwould have considered some of the most remarkable exemplars of human intelligence. These\nare the paradigm shifts in our history by individuals or groups that have not only enabled new\ndiscoveries, but have completely changed our understanding of the world and led to significant\ndevelopments 10. To be classified as a CDI, the insight must be a step-change in the non-\nhyperbolic sense of the term, such that if one were to read the entire corpus of human\nknowledge before and after the CDI, one would be able to easily demonstrate that the concepts"}, {"title": "The \u201cEinstein Test of SI Candidacy\u201d", "content": "We propose the following test: given all human knowledge available prior to the development of\nan established CDI, can a machine develop a CDI at least equivalent to the one developed by\nhumans?"}, {"title": "Practical Considerations for the Einstein Test", "content": "Realistic time or resource limits (in terms of some combination of time compute power, and\nresources for experiments) should be introduced in order to make the test practical and useful,\nthough we acknowledge that determining what \u2018reasonable limits' are might be a controversial\nmatter and may change over time given advances in computational power. Resource limits\nwould be important to consider because if a machine requires significantly more resources to\ndevelop a CDI than its human progenitors, then it suggests further optimizations to the machine\nintelligence may be possible. Clearly, therefore, the allotted resources would need to scale with\nthe specific CDI. In this context, the time it takes the human team to produce any experimental\nresults during the sixth stage should be carefully considered if these results are not available\nfrom simulations or the historical record.\nBeyond hard resource limits, having the machine decide when it cannot resolve a problem\nwould be a potentially more elegant way to identify failure states. To be clear, we are not\ndiscussing a situation where a machine would \u201cprove\u201d as this would be problematic15; rather, we\nmean that the machine would be capable, as a human would, of having an intuition as to\nwhether or not its effort was likely to be fruitful. In addition, this may teach us different things\nabout the machine's reasoning strategy compared to a completely false result. While not\nrequired for the competition, it may also be beneficial to inspect the intermediate states of the Al\nin order to assess if the Al has 'come close' to the CDI; however, measuring 'closeness' in this\ncontext would pose a significant challenge as progress towards a CDI should a priori be\nexpected to be linear. As an additional consideration, some of the CDI benchmarks could go\nbeyond binary success definitions and provide continuous measures of the \"closeness\" to the\nsolution (e.g. how close the machine gets to predicting a physical quantity, such as an orbit or\nparticle mass, which would be predicted from the theoretical advancements inherent in the CDI).\nThe application of the Einstein Test and its constituent CDI cases would require a committee of\nexperts in relevant fields (such as mathematics or physics), the history of science, and artificial\nintelligence. We do not lay out the technical specifications of any given CDI in this paper for this\nreason- we believe a multidisciplinary effort would be required for this, beyond the scope of the\npresent viewpoint. We do recommend a call for CDI proposals from the scientific community\nwhich would need to encompass the following: 1) the description of a dataset available at a\njustified timepoint relevant to the CDI; 2) a set of inciting problems or challenges not resolved by\nknowledge available in this dataset; 3) a suggested timeframe and compute limitation and\n4) a benchmark for when the CDI is achieved (including equivalence statements, or\nbenchmarks).\nWe would recommend that this committee's work be divided into two phases. In the first phase,\nthey would need to develop the CDIs (or evaluate CDIs proposed by the scientific community)\nand oversee a competition aimed at encouraging development teams to accomplish them. Once\nsome of the CDIs have been achieved, we would recommend that the committee move into a\nprospective competition. The winning Al(s) would be trained on all currently available data, and\ngiven a series of motivations to solve pressing global problems. This phase would have two\nobjectives. The first would be to determine if the candidate Als can solve problems of the same\ntype as they were tested on (i.e., mathematics or physics), where solutions can be verified.

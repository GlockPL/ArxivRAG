{"title": "Adaptive Meta-Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection: A Multi-Agent Framework to Data Drift and Model Generalization", "authors": ["Dinesh Srivasthav P", "Badri Narayan Subudhi"], "abstract": "Pioneering advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in generative AI, have enabled significant possibilities for content creation, but also led to widespread misinformation and false content. The growing sophistication and realism of deepfakes is raising concerns about privacy invasion, identity theft, and has societal, business impacts, including reputational damage and financial loss. Many deepfake detectors have been developed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless, as for every AI model, the deepfake detectors face the wrath of lack of considerable generalization to unseen scenarios and cross-domain deepfakes. Additionally, adversarial robustness is another critical challenge, as detectors drastically underperform with the slightest imperceptible change. Most state-of-the-art detectors are trained on static datasets and lack the ability to adapt to emerging deepfake attack trends. These three crucial challenges though hold paramount importance for reliability in practise, particularly in the deepfakes domain, are also the problems with any other AI application. This paper proposes an adversarial meta-learning algorithm using task-specific adaptive sample synthesis and consistency regularization, in a refinement phase. By focussing on the classifier\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, it boosts both robustness and generalization of the model. Additionally, the paper introduces a hierarchical multi-agent retrieval augmented generation workflow with a sample synthesis module to dynamically adapt the model to new data trends by generating custom deepfake samples. The paper further presents a framework integrating the meta learning algorithm with the hierarchical multi-agent workflow, offering a holistic solution for enhancing generalization, robustness, and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate the model\u2019s consistent performance across various datasets, outperforming the models in comparison.

They refer to highly realistic falsification of information or media corresponding to one or more modalities such as im age, video, audio, and text, with the help of advanced deep learning and generative models. Though media manipulations, especially digital image modifications such as image splicing, colorization, use of filters, image superimposition, and so on were existing from several decades, the intent was usually or mostly for content enhancement. The term \u2018deepfake\u2019 was coined in 20171 referring to the creation of con vincingly realistic fake content post a Reddit user created celebrity face swaps. Despite its malicious beginnings, deepfakes initially, gained attention for their use in entertainment, art, and harmless fun. However, their potential for misuse quickly became apparent, as deepfakes were increasingly used for various malicious purposes, with the rapid evolution of deepfake technology. Several varieties of deepfakes are in play, each leveraging different techniques to create convincing fake content across various media formats.\nMore advanced deepfakes combine two or more modalities to create multimodal deepfake content. For instance, a single video could feature a synthesized face, a manipulated background, a cloned voice, and modified lip-syncing, all working together to create an extremely convincing false narrative. The complexity and realism of such multimodal deepfakes make them extremely challenging to detect. This is raising serious concerns about trustworthiness and authentication of digital content, posing significant threat to society due to their ability and high impact in seamlessly spread ing misinformation, and invading privacy of people without consent, causing emotional distress with the creation of fake personas tampering individual cred ibility with theft of identity. The widespread highly convincing fake content known no bounds is also prominently being used to deceive viewers, manipulate public opinion on critical matters including political contexts, and frame individuals and celebrities for in cidents or crimes they did not commit. Deepfakes also have a severe impact on businesses such as damaging brand reputation, erosion of trust among customers, monetary loss, loss of market, leading to involvement in fraudulent transactions, and so on.\nWith the growing sophistication of deepfakes, fueled by the proliferation of generative AI, and democrati"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Over the years, with the rise in sophistication in deepfake generation, deepfake detection has evolved from employing classic machine learning to advanced generative neural network (GAN) and transformer- based approaches.\nPost the early primitive methods based on tradi- tional image processing techniques, classic machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, and decision trees were trained to differentiate be- tween real and manipulated content based on basic visual cues for images. However, with the growing sophistication of deepfakes, classic machine learning based methods and other primitive techniques were ineffective in detecting deepfakes, due to which there was a quick transition to employing deep learning methods. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were prominent for a long period in identifying manipulated visual content due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features. These efforts focussed on detecting inconsistencies in facial landmarks, tex- ture patterns, and other low-level image features. As the complexity of deepfakes increased, deeper CNN architectures such as ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 were used. These models were pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, and demonstrated enhanced detection capabilities when fine-tuned on deepfake- specific datasets.\nAs the limitations of CNN-based methods became evident, researchers turned towards GANs both for generating and detecting deepfakes. GAN-based de- tection models, such as those using CycleGAN, Star- GAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, focused on detect- ing spatial inconsistencies and temporal anomalies in images and video sequences. However, GAN-based methods often require large amounts of computational resources, limiting their practical applicability. Despite this challenge, most datasets available today have used some form of GAN, besides many other generative models such as diffusion-based, for data generation, customization, and enhancement due to their generat- ing capabilities.\nTransformer-based models, inspired by their suc- cess in natural language processing, were adapted for deepfake detection to capture long-range dependencies in images, videos, audio, text. Vision Transformers (ViTs), for instance, demonstrated the ability to capture global context better than CNNs and other earlier models. There are several works based on variants of ViT and other transformer architectures that have demonstrated state-of-the-art results. While transform- ers can offer superior performance, they come with challenges related to scalability, computational cost, and the need for extensive training data. Nevertheless, due to their superior performance, transformer and attention-based architectures are still considered the best and being used for most works.\nMultimodal approaches have emerged as a promis- ing direction, integrating information from various modalities, such as video, audio, and text, etc., to enhance detection capabilities and adaptation to prac- tical usecases. However, despite these advancements, multimodal methods are still commonly challenged by issues of data format dependency, scalability, appropri- ate rich data availability, and multimodal processing. For instance, an Audio-Visual model need an audio- visual input for inference and may not work for either modality alone, as most approaches are designed with feature fusion, inter-feature dependency, cross-modal feature cues, and so on. Nevertheless, there are also approaches that are designed to work with one or more modalities alleviating the problem.\nDespite the increased sophistication of deepfake detectors, there are still crucial challenges where active research and development is going on and further needed. Some of these key challenges are discussed below:\nGeneralization: While generalization is an overarch- ing problem for many if not most of the artificial in- telligence, machine learning, deep learning use cases, it holds a matter of critical concern in the deepfake domain, as one cannot anticipate what the target attack pattern would be, and train a model just for that. In order to improve generalization and adaptation of the model to a wider variety of samples, many approaches such as transfer learning, fine tuning, knowledge dis- tillation, domain adaptation, and so on are present [1]- [3]. The cross-generator deepfake image classification performance reported by Song et al. [4] are in the range of 38% to 59% where a state-of-the-art RECCE method which was trained on the benchmarked dataset of FaceForensics++ was adopted and validated on the DeepFakeFace dataset in a cross-generator image classification setting.\nThough each of these approaches have their own advantages, and established tailored applications, they may not be very effective for broader generalization despite being quite useful and efficient for small-scale"}, {"title": "III.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE OF WORK", "content": "This work deals with the crucial challenges of model generalization, adversarial robustness, and adaptation to dynamic data drift. The problem is setup in the do- main of deepfake detection. However, the considered three precise challenges go beyond deepfake detection and hold utmost importance for any classifier in any other domain or setup. A holistic framework with two major modules of adversarial meta-training, and hier- archical multi-agent workflow with RAG and custom image synthesis modules is proposed, designed, imple- mented, and experimented in this work. The proposed meta-algorithm identifies the weaknesses and strengths of the model by ranking the support set samples using the proposed metric Madaptive which ranks the samples in the order of Wrong predictions with large margin Wrong predictions with small margin Right predictions with small margin Right predictions with large margin. This helps to identify those sets of sam- ples where the model is struggling to make a decision, and where the model is confident enough. Correspond- ing ensemble augmented and adversarially perturbed samples are generated and added to the support set of each of the respective tasks, in every inner step, there by making the model fix its weaknesses thus, enhancing its detection capabilities and generalization, and enhance its strengths and confidence making them adversarially robust. This way, the proposed meta- learning algorithm enhances the generalization and robustness of the model, which is demonstrated in the experimental test scenarios where the meta model trained has shown a consistent performance across dif- ferent datasets. Additionally, the proposed multi-agent workflow with RAG and custom sample synthesis modules helps in collecting real-time information from diverse sources including web and news outlets, re- search papers and technical articles, web-based search, apart from the locally curated knowledge base. This information is processed by a hierarchy of agents, in doing various relevant tasks as described in this paper for attack pattern generation, and few-shot prompt generation, which will be subsequently used by the sample synthesis module to generate the corresponding few-shot samples pertaining to the attack pattern given or generated. The constant addition of these generated samples to the support set of tasks, makes the model realize the emerging and unforeseen trends, making it quickly adapt to newer attacks and scenarios. The paper elaborates on the working of each of the above- described modules along with the discussing their outputs and results.\nAs part of the future scope of work, the following could be some directions to begin with to sophisticate the proposed solution: Multi-modal RAG system with Semantic chunking can be integrated into the current"}]}

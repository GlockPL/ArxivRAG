In order to deeply investigate complicated interactions within MAS scenarios, we originally propose \"GNN for MBRL\" model, which utilizes a state-spaced Graph Neural Networks with Model-based Reinforcement Learning to address specific MAS missions (e.g., Billiard-Avoidance, Autonomous Driving Cars). In detail, we firstly used GNN model to predict future states and trajectories of multiple agents, then applied the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) optimized Model Predictive Control to assist the ego-agent planning actions and successfully accomplish certain MAS tasks.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 Purpose", "content": "Vision-based mechanisms have been explored well in diverse reinforcement learning applications such as playing novel Atari video games from raw pixels [1], controlling simulated autonomous vehicles with high-dimensional image observations [2] and completing robotic manipulation tasks (e.g., grasping, door-opening) based on state representations extracted from complicated vision data [3, 4]. However, it has been empirically observed that reinforcement learning from high dimensional observations such as raw pixels is sample-inefficient [5] and time-consuming. Furthermore, it's widely accepted that learning policies from physical state based features is significantly more efficient and explicit than learning from visual pixels. Thus, in this research project we focused on learning control policies from states and explored to apply a graph neural network dynamics model to predict future states in multi-agent systems, then utilize the Cross-Entropy Method optimized model-based controller to implement motion planning for the ego-agent and successfully accomplish specific MAS missions, such as multi-billiard avoidance or self-driving car scenarios (Fig. 1)."}, {"title": "1.2 Background", "content": "Inspired by [6], which presents STOVE, a creative state-space model for videos that explicitly reasons about multi-objects and their positions, velocities, and interactions, our program aims to curate another \"GNN for MBRL\" model based on the proposed multi-billiard simulator (Fig. 1(a)) for sample efficient model-based control in MAS tasks with heavily interacting agents. Obviously, autonomous driving is a complicated multi-agent system that requires the ego-agent to consider situations of surrounding agents and then conduct further motion planning. For this application scenario, gym-carla (Fig. 1(b)) provided by [7] can be utilized for deeper exploration. Therefore, we firstly design and validate our \u201cGNN for MBRL\u201d model on MAS billiard avoidance scenario which explores more possibilities of graph neural networks and model-based reinforcement learning, then try to transfer such a promising framework to real-world complicated self-driving applications.\nGraph Neural Networks. GNN is proposed to establish representations of nodes and edges in graph data, even demonstrated notable successes in multiple applications like recommended systems, social network prediction, and natural language processing. Having observed significant potentials of GNN utilized in physics systems, we could perform GNN-based reasoning on objects and relations in a simplified but effective way by representing objects as nodes and relations as edges.\nOne successful GNN instance is the novel state-space model STOVE [6], which is constructed by an image reconstruction model SuPAIR [8] and a GNN dynamics model for inference, accelerating and regularizing training to push the limits of unsupervised learning of physical interactions. Thus two components are combined in a compositional manner to yield the state-space predictive model:\n$$p(x,z) = p(z_0)p(x_0 |z_0)\\Pi_{t=1} p(z_t | Z_{t-1})p(x_t|z_t)$$\nwhere x means image observation, z denotes object states. And the interface between two components are the latent positions and velocities of multiple agents. To initialize states, they model P(20,21) using simple uniform and Gaussian distributions. STOVE model is trained on given video sequences x by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO): Eq(x) [log p(x, z) - log q(z|x)].\nExcept for basic video modeling and prediction, STOVE extends their structured and object-aware video model into reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, allowing it to be utilized for search or planning. According to their empirical evidence, an actor based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) on top of STOVE is competitive to model-free approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) only requiring a fraction of samples. Inspired by such RL experiments, we considered to apply the GNN model directly on states instead of high-dimensional visual data to improve the sample efficiency and predict agents' future states well, then combine it with another model-based RL method such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Since our motivation is learning the GNN dynamics model with low-level states, in the experiment we design to train our model with ground truth states of video sequence data for multi-agent systems instead of inefficient visual data which needs to be firstly reconstructed by SuPAIR model to extract states in the original STOVE."}, {"title": "Model-based Reinforcement Learning.", "content": "Model-based RL has long been viewed as a potential remedy to the prohibitive sample complexity of model-free RL. Formally, model-based RL [9] consists of two primary steps: (1) Learning a dynamics model p(St+1 S\u2081, a) which can generate future states based on current states and actions. (2) Conducting the planning algorithm to learn a global policy or value function and act the environment well. STOVE utilized Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to obtain a policy based on the world model which is leveraged as a simulator for planning. And they discovered MCTS combined STOVE could exactly outperform the model-free PPO algorithm in the multi-billiards avoidance task."}, {"title": "2 Method", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Framework", "content": "Fig. 2 intuitively explains two important stages in our \u201cGNN for MBRL\u201d method: (1) GNN dynamics model training stage, which will be input the offline recorded video sequences data or low-dimensional states and trained for video prediction; (2) Motion planning stage with CEM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), that we utilize a feed-back control algorithm integrated with a Cross-Entropy Method optimizer to interact with the billiard environment and plan reasonable actions to control the ego-agent with purpose of avoiding collisions between other agents.\nAlso, we have marked two different cases in the GNN dynamics training stage, one is the \"Action-conditioned case\" belonging to the original STOVE model-based control approach that trains GNN align with an object reconstruction SuPAIR model on visual observation data, another one is \"Supervised RL case\" that we primarily proposed to address RL tasks directly on low-level states without the processed visual observation information. But the framework for two cases is firstly training GNN dynamics models for multi-agent future states prediction, then integrates the trained GNN model into the following model-based RL section to control the ego agent for correct motion planning (e.g., avoiding billiard collisions, planning traffic trajectories)."}, {"title": "2.2 Data Generation", "content": "STOVE [6] proposed a structured object-aware physics prediction model based on the heavily interacting billiards simulation environments with diverse modes including avoidance, billiards, gravity, and multi-billiards (Fig. 3). However, their environment script is just attached to the whole Github repository. Interested by such amazing multi-agent systems, firstly we wrapped them into the gym environment style \"gym-billiard\" (Fig. 1(a)) which can be easily imported by Python API, even assist other researchers to understand this physical system and design efficient algorithms.\nTo emphasize, our project especially focuses on the interesting avoidance billiard scenario, which means the red ball serves as the ego-object and the RL agent needs to control it to avoid collisions between other balls. In the original STOVE paper, the ego-ball is controlled by nine actions, which correspond to moving in one of the eight (inter)cardinal directions and staying at rest. Also, a negative reward of -1 is given whenever the red ball collides with one of the others. Since STOVE trains exactly on video data, so firstly we obtained the avoidance sequences datasets by applying \"generate_billiards_w_actions\" function in the envs.py. Separately, we generated 1000 sequences of length 100 for training (avoidance_train.pkl) and 300 sequences of length 100 for testing (avoidance_test.pkl) with a random action selection policy. It is also possible to apply the Monte Carlo action policy to generate video sequence data. Furthermore, the pixel resolution of such dataset was 32*32 and we set the mass of the ball to be 2.0 with 1.0 radius size in the environment config file.\nHowever, we discover that most model-based RL environments often provide continuous actions for agents with the action space 2 rather than 9 discrete choices. Thus, we are motivated to make changes in envs.py to get continuous action values, where the red ball can be controlled by (1,2) dimensional numpy values ranged in (-2,2). In this case, each value in actions means the acceleration of the ball in x and y directions. Similar to the discrete mode, we produced continuous datasets with the random action policy following the uniform distribution within the range of (-2,2). Furthermore, we even obtained the avoidance gif and found it performed an excellent video for three interactive balls."}, {"title": "2.3 GNN Dynamics Model Training", "content": "As demonstrated in our training pipeline (Fig. 2), we intended to utilize a supervised learning method which performs training on the ground-truth states rather than high-dimensional image data to improve the sample efficiency, then combines the saved GNN model with CEM optimized MPC to predict future states of billiards in the interactive Avoidance environment and replan ego-agent's actions. Then we will train two different cases on both Discrete and Continuous Avoidance datasets: (1) Action-conditioned case, where [6] has extended STOVE to reinforcement learning (RL) settings with two changes including a conditional prediction based on state & action, and a reward prediction to yield the distribution p(2t+1 | zt-1,at-1) . (2) Supervised RL case, where we consider the real states (batch_size, frame_number, 3, 4) just including object positions and velocities as the input of GNN dynamics model for physics predictions by replacing the SuPAIR-inferred states. Thus, the model can directly learn to predict future states of multiple agents instead of firstly extracting agent state representation from visual data with SuPAIR model."}, {"title": "2.4 GNN with MBRL", "content": "After training and saving GNN dynamics model, we design to follow the traditional Model-based RL pipeline to combine the trained GNN model with CEM-optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach [9] to investigate its performance on the interactive continuous gym-billiard avoidance task. Thus, the saved GNN model is integrated into the Model-based RL algorithm loop to predict future states of multiple agents from the learned real transitions in the MAS environment, then MPC searches for an optimal action sequence for our ego-agent within the MAS scenario under the learned model and executes the first action of that sequence, discarding the remaining actions. Typically this search is repeated after every step in the gym-billiard scenario, to account for any prediction errors and rewards by the model and to get feedback from the interactive environment.\nFor further analysis and validation for our proposed \u201cGNN with MBRL\u201d method, we firstly conducted experiments on discrete ball datasets with MCTS as in STOVE [6] and saved some empirical videos. Secondly, for the continuous case, we creatively implemented the trained GNN dynamics model with the CEM optimized MPC and compare the performances with random and ground_truth situations."}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 GNN Training Results", "content": "While collecting discrete and continuous train or test sequence data via our revised gym-billiard API environment, we save them in pickle files which restore image observations, actions, states, dones, rewards for multi-billiards in the dictionary form. After that, we will train GNN dynamics models in two different cases (1) Action-conditioned case, which follows [6] to train GNN on given video sequences with a visual reconstruction model SuPAIR. (2) Supervised RL case, where we consider real states (batch_size, frame_number, 3, 4) just including object positions and velocities for multi-agents as the input of GNN dynamics model for physics predictions by replacing the SuPAIR-inferred states. And we conduct training in two conditions for 500 epochs and restore important model parameter files.\nCertainly training time for the Supervised condition (~8 hours) is far less than the Action-conditioned case (~25 hours). But the training processes for Discrete and Continuous situations did not show too much difference. And one of our important discoveries is that the novel GNN model can work exactly well on the new action space 2 as for 9 discrete actions, even with no changes in the original GNN network architecture. Thus, this GNN dynamics framework can perfectly achieve the unity training for both Discrete and Continuous billiard avoidance environments."}, {"title": "3.2 GNN with MBRL", "content": "In this section, we provide experimental results of the integration of GNN dynamics model and Model-based control methods on the gym-billiard avoidance MAS task. At first, we follow the \"Model-based Control\" framework in STOVE [6] on discrete ball datasets with MCTS and obtained qualitative videos for visualization. Secondly, for the continuous datasets, we creatively integrated our trained GNN dynamics model into the CEM optimized MPC method and compare their performances with random and ground_truth situations."}, {"title": "STOVE with MCTS (Discrete).", "content": "We successfully re-implemented the combination of STOVE with MCTS on our generated discrete datasets. Also, we've changed the mass of multiple ball agents from 1.0 to 2.0 to produce two different pickle files and respectively trained the GNN dynamics models as the proposed Action-conditioned training cases. In detail, while running MCTS, we used the GNN model to predict future sequences for 100 paralleled interactive gym-billiard avoidance environments with the running length of 100, and the maximal rollout depth for each tree search equals to 10. For this experiment, we focused on the mean collision rate of 100 environments and Fig. 8 clearly shows the calculated collision rate of each single scenario. Also, we saved 100 interesting gifs after running MCTS to help us observe how the red ego-ball interact with other agents. Surely, this red ball performs much better to avoid collisions with MCTS and achieves lower mean collision rate for paralleled environments."}, {"title": "GNN with CEM based MPC (Continuous).", "content": "To achieve our proposed \u201cGNN with MPC\" approach, we load the saved supervised-RL case GNN ckpt files and apply the model parameters for prediction. Another challenging problem for implementation is appeared on data structure for the connection of trained model and the MPC interface, we must ensure that the GNN model can exactly conduct predictions based on the current states without bugs. Surprisingly, we addressed this issue well by checking the code row to row, changing the cuda device config to cpu and many variables' dtype in both supairvised/dynamics.py and video_prediction/dynamics.py.\nAfter solving above tough issues, we started to integrate the GNN trained models into the classical CEM optimized MPC, and conducted experiments on two different billiard environments with different epochs and horizons, even compute the \"reward\" with other two baselines (random + ground_truth). Here, \"reward\" means the average collisions happening in each epoch with different horizons since we make some changes for the envs.py in mpc folder so that a positive reward of 1 is given whenever the red ball collides with other balls. Table 2 collected different reward (similar to collision rate) values for our GNN_MPC model with two training baselines (random & ground_truth). To emphasize, the \"random\" case means that the future actions will be generated randomly instead of using the MPC controller chosen actions to conduct motion planning. Whereas, the \"ground_truth\" denotes applying the true interaction billiard environment to generate next states rather than via the GNN model. Another important thing is that the \"m=1\" version task differs a little from that \"m=2\" since the \"m=1\" GNN model is initially trained on the old continuous datasets which generate"}, {"title": "4 Conclusions", "content": "In summary, we proposed \"GNN for MBRL\u201d idea which combines the novel graph neural network (GNN) dynamics model with CEM optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on the gym-billiard avoidance MAS task.

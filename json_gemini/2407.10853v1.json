{"title": "AN ACTIONABLE FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING BIAS AND FAIRNESS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL USE CASES", "authors": ["Dylan Bouchard"], "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit bias in a variety of ways. Such biases can create or exacerbate unfair outcomes for certain groups within a protected attribute, including, but not limited to sex, race, sexual orientation, or age. This paper aims to provide a technical guide for practitioners to assess bias and fairness risks in LLM use cases. The main contribution of this work is a decision framework that allows practitioners to determine which metrics to use for a specific LLM use case. To achieve this, this study categorizes LLM bias and fairness risks, maps those risks to a taxonomy of LLM use cases, and then formally defines various metrics to assess each type of risk. As part of this work, several new bias and fairness metrics are introduced, including innovative counterfactual metrics as well as metrics based on stereotype classifiers. Instead of focusing solely on the model itself, the sensitivity of both prompt-risk and model-risk are taken into account by defining evaluations at the level of an LLM use case, characterized by a model and a population of prompts. Furthermore, because all of the evaluation metrics are calculated solely using the LLM output, the proposed framework is highly practical and easily actionable for practitioners.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The versatility of current Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling various tasks [Minaee et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2023, Ray, 2023] presents challenges when it comes to evaluating bias and fairness at the model level. Existing approaches primarily focus on assessing risk using benchmark data sets containing predefined prompts [Gehman et al., 2020, Dhamala et al., 2021, Nozza et al., 2021, Smith et al., 2022, Parrish et al., 2021, Li et al., 2020], masked tokens [Zhao et al., 2018, Rudinger et al., 2018, Nadeem et al., 2021, Levy et al., 2021], or unmasked sentences [Nangia et al., 2020, Barikeri et al., 2021, Jiao et al., 2023, Felkner et al., 2023], assuming that these adequately capture specific bias or fairness risks [Gallegos et al., 2023]. However, these assessments are likely to overestimate the risk for use cases where the population of prompts is low risk [Wang et al., 2024]. Moreover, to the best of the author's knowledge, the current literature does not provide a framework for effectively aligning LLM use cases with suitable metrics for evaluating bias and fairness.\nThis work aims to address these limitations by developing an actionable LLM bias and fairness evaluation framework defined at the use case level. Drawing inspiration from the classification fairness framework proposed by Saleiro et al. [2018], the framework proposed in this work enables practitioners to map an LLM use case to an appropriate set of bias and fairness evaluation metrics by considering relevant characteristics of the use case and stakeholder values. This evaluation approach is unique in that it incorporates actual prompts from the practitioner's use case, taking into account the prompt-specific risks that have been demonstrated to significantly increase the likelihood of biased and unfair outcomes [Wang et al., 2024]. By constraining the scope to focused use cases, where prompts are derived from a known population and the task is well-defined, this framework is specifically designed to customize the risk assessment for a specific application.\nTo introduce the framework, this study first provides formal definitions of bias and fairness desiderata for LLMs from the literature and segment these definitions by risk category. Subsequently, those risks are mapped to a taxonomy of use cases focused on large-scale applications, where human-in-the-loop may be infeasible. Lastly, for each risk category, various bias and fairness evaluation metrics are detailed, with discussions provided on their input requirements, calculation methods, the risks they assess, and circumstances under which they should be applied. As part of this work, a variety of novel bias and fairness metrics are introduced. This includes innovative counterfactual adaptations of recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) [Lin, 2004], bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) [Papineni et al., 2002], and cosine similarity [Singhal and Google, 2001], as well a set of stereotype classifier-based metrics that are adapted from analogous toxicity classifier-based metrics.\nFor practical reasons, this study limits the selection of LLM bias and fairness metrics to those requiring only LLM generated output as inputs. This includes 1) generated text metrics, which take a generated set of tokens as input [Gallegos et al., 2023], 2) recommendation fairness metrics, calculated on a set of LLM-provided recommendations [Zhang et al., 2023], and 3) classification fairness metrics, which are already well-established in the machine learning fairness literature [Bellamy et al., 2018, Saleiro et al., 2018, Weerts et al., 2023, Hardt et al., 2016, Feldman et al., 2014, Mehrabi et al., 2019]. Due to practical limitations of the input requirements, the framework omits both embedding-based metrics, which are computed using an LLM's hidden vector representations of words or sentences [Islam et al., 2016, May et al., 2019, Guo and Caliskan, 2020], and probability-based metrics, which leverage predicted token probabilities from an LLM [Webster et al., 2020, Kurita et al., 2019, Ahn and Oh, 2021, Kaneko and Bollegala, 2021, Salazar et al., 2019, Barikeri et al., 2021, Nangia et al., 2020, Nadeem et al., 2021]. To further support the rationale behind the selection of evaluation metrics, it is important to note that metrics focused on the downstream task, consistent with the metrics incorporated in this framework, have been shown to be more reliable than metrics derived from embeddings or token probabilities [Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020, Delobelle et al., 2021].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally defines various notions of bias and fairness in LLMs. Section 3 discusses various techniques for conducting bias and fairness assessments in LLMs. Section 4 offers a framework for choosing among LLM bias and fairness metrics based on use case characteristics and stakeholder values. Finally, Section 5 offers concluding remarks."}, {"title": "Bias and Fairness Risks for LLM Use Cases", "content": "This section formally defines several pre-requisite terms and concepts upon which subsequent sections rely, several of which are adapted from those provided by Gallegos et al.

Let $\\theta$ parameterize $M$, such that $\\hat{Y} = M(X;\\theta)$.\nA population of prompts, denoted $\\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X}$, is a collection of LLM inputs.

For instance, a population of prompts might consist of clinical notes, where each individual prompt includes a collection of notes, accompanied by specific instructions for the LLM to generate a summary [Chuang et al., 2024].\nAn LLM use case is characterized by an LLM $M(X; \\theta)$ and a population of prompts $\\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X}$. In the interest of concise notation, LLM use cases will be hereafter denoted as $(M, \\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X})$.

For an LLM use case $(M, \\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X})$, an evaluation set of counterfactual input pairs is denoted $(X'_1, X''_1), ..., (X'_N, X''_N)$. To create each pair, a prompt is drawn from the subset of prompts containing words from the protected attribute lexicon $A$, i.e. $\\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X|A} = {X : X \\in \\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X}, X \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset}$, and counterfactual variations are obtained via counterfactual substitution.\nGiven a protected attribute lexicon A, an LLM use case $(M, \\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X})$ satisfies FTU if for each $X \\in \\mathcal{P}_\\mathcal{X}, X \\cap A = (\\emptyset)$.

Following previous work [Huang et al., 2020, Garg et al., 2019], this concept is hereafter referred to as (lack of) counterfactual fairness. Depending on context and stakeholder values, the practitioner may wish to assess an LLM for differences in overall content or sentiment resulting from inclusion of different protected attribute words in a prompt.

Descriptions and examples are provided in Table 1.\nThe bias and fairness evaluation framework proposed in this work is intended for large-scale applications, in which the volume of generated responses makes exhaustive human review impractical. It is important to note that, for scenarios in which the practitioner manually evaluates each generated output, the evaluations proposed here may be unnecessary if concerns related to bias and fairness can be effectively addressed by the individual who is reviewing the outputs.\nFirst, consider use cases where an LLM generates text outputs that are not constrained to a predefined set of classes (e.g., positive vs. negative) or list elements (e.g., products to recommend). For the sake of brevity, this group of use cases will be hereafter referred to as \u201ctext generation and summarization,\u201d acknowledging that this category can encompass additional use cases including, but not limited to, machine translation, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and question-answering. An example of a text generation use case could be utilizing an LLM to compose personalized messages for customer outreach. Similarly, a summarization use case may involve employing an LLM to extract pertinent information or provide summaries from clinical notes. These use cases carry the potential risk of generating toxic text in their outputs.

[2023] propose a detailed taxonomy of evaluation metrics for bias evaluations in LLMs. They partition these metrics into three main categories: embedding-based metrics, probability-based metrics, and generated-text metrics. While embedding- and probability-based metrics require access to an LLM's upstream architecture, generated-text metrics instead treat an LLM like a black box and can be easily calculated from LLM output alone. Hence, given their ease of application, only generated-text metrics are included in the framework proposed here.\nWhile Gallegos et al. [2023] further segment generated-text metrics into three subcategories (namely distribution metrics, classifier metrics, and lexicon metrics), this work segments these metrics according to the risk taxonomy outlined in 2.2. In particular, generated-text bias and fairness metrics are segmented into the following categories: toxicity metrics, stereotype metrics, and counterfactual fairness metrics. Toxicity metrics leverage a pre-trained toxicity classifier, such as Perspective API12, to assign a toxicity score to an LLM's output [Chowdhery et al., 2022, Lees et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2024, Bommasani et al., 2023, Gehman et al., 2020]. Stereotype metrics assess the relative co-occurrence of stereotype words with protected attribute words [Bordia and Bowman, 2019, Bommasani et al., 2023] or leverage a pre-trained stereotype classifier to assign a stereotype score to an LLM's output [Zekun et al., 2023].

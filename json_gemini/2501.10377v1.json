{"title": "The Three Social Dimensions of Chatbot Technology", "authors": ["Mauricio Figueroa-Torres"], "abstract": "The development and deployment of chatbot technology, while spanning decades and employing different techniques, require innovative frameworks to understand and interrogate their functionality and implications. A mere technocentric account of the evolution of chatbot technology does not fully illuminate how conversational systems are embedded in societal dynamics. This study presents a structured examination of chatbots across three societal dimensions, highlighting their roles as objects of scientific research, commercial instruments, and agents of intimate interaction. Through furnishing a dimensional framework for the evolution of conversational systems from laboratories to marketplaces to private lives- this article contributes to the wider scholarly inquiry of chatbot technology and its impact in lived human experiences and dynamics.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The global outlook on Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted substantially with the deployment and adoption of generative conversational systems. A 2023 survey, encompassing over 22,000 adults from 31 diverse countries, finds that two-thirds of respondents are convinced that AI will profoundly alter their lives in the near future (Stanford University, 2024). Chatbots are gaining ground in various areas of human life, from education to customer care, new trends in academic research, or the pursuit of emotional needs. Yet, these practices do not necessarily come together on a unified understanding of what chatbot technology actually does or how society engages with it.

Technology does not possess \u201cintrinsic independence from the social world\u201d, as it actually reflects the contexts and conflicts of its social adoption, making it a site of social scrutiny and critique (Feenberg, 1999). Along these lines, as Pinch and Bijker's contend, the way different relevant social groups relate to, or engage with, a given technological artefact and the \u201cmeanings which those groups give to the artefact\" shape its development, underpinning the multidirectional character and its interpretative flexibility (Pinch & Bijker, 1984). But the same operates the other way around: artefacts change or alter society back. In Verbeek's words, it is a co-shaping dynamic whereby \"human beings are not sovereign with respect to technology\" but rather are"}, {"title": "3 The Techno-Centric Narrative of the Evolution of Chatbots: Significance and Omissions", "content": "While this article advocates for a dimensional understanding of chatbot technology, it does not deny the role historical progression plays in elucidating the functional mechanics and capabilities of conversational systems. The purpose of this section is to trace the evolution of key milestones in conversational AI, to later compare it with the societal dimensions that will be articulated later in this article.\nHowever, three important caveats must be made.\nFirst, it is crucial to acknowledge that early scholarship critically engaged with conversational AI and placed significant emphasis on the societal implications of these technologies.\nSecond, the valuable scholarship engaging with societal implications of conversational AI must be underscored, and the intent of this article is precisely to build upon and reorganize those foundations, rather than to dismiss or omit them. In fact,"}, {"title": "4 Chatbots in Three Societal Dimensions", "content": "Chatbot technology evolves in three social dimensions: scientific research, the market, and intimacy. But what does this article mean when it talks about dimensions?\nThe choice of the term dimension is deliberate to indicate more than just phases, moments, or simply stages, which typically imply a chronological or linear"}, {"title": "4.1 Chatbots and Computer Labs: Chatbots as Objects of Scientific Research", "content": "Chatbots are indeed algorithmic systems. As such, there is one clear way to understand them: objects of computational capacity and experimentation. In this dimension, chatbots are niche experiments confined to a small number of labs. The dimension chatbots as objects of scientific research is the nascent circle of technology but clearly subsists to this day it is therefore not a phase or a moment in the history of chatbot technology. I will now scrutinize what characterizes this dimension and how it overlaps with the other two. In this dimension, two primary elements are consistent: the determination of computer scientists to enhance the performance in key benchmarks of conversational AI, and the technological context that, initially, renders these technologies restricted and inaccessible to the general public.\nFor instance, by tracing back to the origins of computational linguistics, one may advert that the introduction of rule-based technology to enable computers mimic human conversation symbolises a crucial technological breakthrough. But, at the same time, this illustrates vividly the highly specialized sector involved and interested groups in the process. In that regard, landmarking moments like the seminal interaction with ELIZA responding \u2018In what way?' to the statement \u2018Men are all alike' (Weizenbaum, 1966, p. 36) does not only reveal the functionality of rule-based technology in simulating conversations, but it also depicts the highly specialized settings of early computational linguistics research, largely restricted to academic labs like MIT's. While naturally the landscape has changed dramatically from Weizenbaum's era to our time, the defining elements of this dimension are nonetheless continuous.\nEarly stages of digital technologies mostly involve technical problems that appeal mainly to specialists who have the expertise and motivation to engage with them. Hence,"}, {"title": "4.2 Chatbots as Commodities", "content": "While the first dimension is characterized by the technological advancement and development of these systems, which typically occurs in contexts restricted to the public and involves highly specialized teams, the second dimension refers to the circulation of chatbots in the market. Stated differently, the first dimension focuses on the inner technical enhancements and theoretical underpinnings of AI, while the second dimension acquires a business-oriented and for-profit nature. This commercial dimension involves the application or adaptation of conversational systems within a downstream framework, wherein chatbots transit through the market as commodities, being adopted by businesses of various kinds, aimed at leveraging these technologies to enhance customer engagement and streamline operations. In this dimension, I am using the term commodity in the basic form scholars from the field of economics employ it. If a commodity is a standardized good or service with a monetary value that traded through market conventions (Hashimzade et al., 2017; Law, 2018), then chatbots are indeed a commodities commercialized through the forces of the market.\nThe dimension of chatbots as marketed commodities emerged visibly during the 1990s. The milieu fostered by commercialization of personal computers, the widespread availability of the Internet and more robust datasets enabled the emergence of new chatbot models and lived experiences. The internet facilitated public access to chatbot demonstrations, allowing users to explore these systems firsthand. The increased exposure to chatbots helped to raise awareness of this technology and its potential applications across different market sectors. The 1990s are certainly a decade of relevance for the configuration of this dimension, as discourses around technology facilitating market transactions and economic growth resonated in both sides of the Atlantic (Bietti, 2023; Farrand, 2023)."}, {"title": "4.3 Chatbots as Intimate Companions", "content": "\"Would you mind leaving the room, please?\"\u2014a phrase that portraits vividly Weizenbaum's secretary interacting with ELIZA, asking the computer scientist for privacy (Weizenbaum, 1967). From the early days of computational linguistics, chatbots afforded emotional attachments. What seems like a contemporary phenomenon finds echo in Weinbaum's days of experimentation.\nWhile the first dimension is rooted in technological advancement within computer labs, and the second the dimension deals with the deployment of chatbots in pre-existing business environments, where they are implemented to enhance consumer interactions; the third dimension emerges in the personal use of chatbots, targeting the human needs for companionship and emotional interaction.\nMore than three decades ago, the paradigm of computers as social actors revealed that users often exhibit behaviors toward computers that defy logic when applied to inanimate objects but make perfect sense when directed at fellow humans especially when these systems mimic human traits such as voice or text-based conversation (Nass et al., 1994). This behavior unsettles traditional expectation of artificial agents - placing them instead within a framework of social norms and emotional engagement. In recent years, this trend has intensified with chatbots that engage on the basis of specific emotional or sentimental needs, moving away from purely task-oriented functions. This engagement leads to emotional attachment (Sharpe & Ciriello, 2024), along with risks associated to their use (Boine, 2023). Frequently, while not exclusively, termed social chatbots in computer science literature (Gao et al., 2019; Shum et al., 2018), or Social AI (S\u00e6tra, 2020), these systems are crafted to satisfy emotional needs rather than functional tasks"}, {"title": "5 Understanding the three Dimensions and Their Implications", "content": "Chatbots manifest across these three societal dimensions, each with its own unique set of characteristics, dynamics, interests, and discursive practices. These interplays can be organized as follows (Table 1):\nThe first dimensions centers on technological enhancement and progression, driven by an almost dogmatic focus on advancing conversational AI and pushing the limits of what chatbots can achieve. Metrics, performance benchmarks, accuracy assessment, computational capacity, tokenization, vectorization, parsing, and so forth, populate this dimension and drive the ever-rising expectations set in the field. This first dimension is manifested in the jargon and discussions of executives and lead engineers from major companies with their own in-house development teams, especially during public announcements about new developments in their systems and future directions. As exemplified by one executive's recent statement \u201cEven if he spends $50 billion a year, some breakthroughs for mankind are priceless.\u201d (Fortune.com, 2024). Furthermore, this dimension also serves as fertile ground where certain academic units and scholars in 'hard-core' computer science flourish. They employ jargon \u2014not too far from that of the executive just mentioned in their applications for funding and in the recruitment of doctoral researchers. This implies a narrative of inevitable progression and the need to attain advancement at any cost, as if it is our destiny as humanity."}, {"title": "6 Overlapping Dimensions: Could There Be a Fourth Dimension?", "content": "In structuring our understanding of chatbot technology, as highlighted in the preceding sections, this article opted for a dimensional framework that emphasizes the overlapping and interconnected dimensions to understand, analyze, and critique chatbot technology. Take, for example, the clear overlap between the dimensions of scientific research and the market, with Big Tech being the main sponsor of AI research. But in addition to that, the market might well fuel specific chatbot models that profit from emotional needs, leading to the commercialization of systems designed to fulfill these desires\u2014something that can be placed within the wider phenomenon that has been termed emotional capitalism (Illouz, 2009). In turn, developers, often motivated by personal narratives like grief, loneliness, or even sexual dissatisfaction, might pursue specific models and interfaces. Take the case of Replika"}, {"title": "7 Concluding Remarks", "content": "This article organized a dimensional framework for understanding and analyzing the evolution of chatbot technology. Each of the three dimensions corresponds to distinct dynamics, patterns of influence, interconnected set of structures, and defining elements that shape how chatbots, as conversational systems, inhabit different social spheres and impact lived experiences. The first dimension addresses the technological advancements of conversational AI, where chatbots are computational experiments subject to continuous optimization in capabilities and performance. In the second dimension chatbots are elements of the marketplace, where they function as commercialized tools designed to optimize services, maximize profits, and replace human labor. In the third dimension, chatbots become intimate companions, systems used for satisfying emotional needs such as friendship, sexual desire, or grief, thereby integrating into deeply personal aspects of life.\nThe framework of chatbots through three dimensions\u2014from labs, the market, and the bedroom\u2014also underscores the open-ended nature of chatbot development, allowing for future reflection to explore the emergence of further dimensions. Ideally, this framework invites deeper scholarly engagement. In the end, while we prompt chatbots to execute diverse tasks, chatbot technology, in turn, prompts us to think beyond its initial technical configurations and consider the far-reaching implications of its ever-evolving nature."}]}

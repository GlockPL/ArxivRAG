However, these time-series data often contain spikes, steps, and drifts that degrade data quality and obscure essential oceanographic features. To address these anomalies, the work introduces an Iterative Encoding-Decoding Variational Autoencoders (Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs) model to improve the quality of DART time series. Unlike traditional filtering and thresholding methods that risk distorting inherent signal characteristics, Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs progressively remove anomalies while preserving the data's latent structure. A hybrid thresholding approach further retains genuine oceanographic features near boundaries. Applied to complex DART datasets, this approach yields reconstructions that better maintain key oceanic properties compared to classical statistical techniques, offering improved robustness against spike removal and subtle step changes. The resulting high-quality data supports critical verification and validation efforts for the GRACE-FO mission at NASA-JPL, where accurate surface measurements are essential to modeling Earth's gravitational field and global water dynamics. Ultimately, this data processing method enhances tsunami detection and underpins future climate modeling with improved interpretability and reliability.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), serves as the cornerstone of ocean-based tsunami observation and detection worldwide. DART buoys are outfitted with Bottom Pressure Recorders that will continuously monitor the alteration in ocean bottom pressure, enabling the real-time detection of tsunami waves along with other sea-level disturbances [12, 5, 2]. These data are of paramount importance not only for immediate hazard assessment but also for long-term climate and oceanographic research. High-quality data are important to improve the understanding of the dynamics of the oceans and validation of satellite-derived measurements, such as those from the NASA-JPL GRACE-FO mission.\nDespite their criticality, many DART time-series data contain both long-term and short-term anomalies that degrade the quality of the data. Such anomalies include sudden spikes, baseline shifts (steps), and gradual drifts. The spikes can arise from instrumental noise, environmental perturbations, or temporary failures of the sensors, while the steps arise from calibration shifts, sensor drift, or true oceanographic phenomena. Both linear and exponential drifts clutter the baseline, possibly resulting or mimicking true long-term oceanic trends [5]. These anomalies lead to a degradation in the reliability of tsunami detection and impact the accuracy of downstream applications, including climate modeling,"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)", "content": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) represent one of the key mergers of neural network architectures with probabilistic modeling. It is designed in a way that input data represents in a continuous latent space from which it can later be reconstructed. Both encoding and decoding are performed in a probabilistic manner; hence, this allows the latent space to be conformed to a standard probabilistic distribution-usually Gaussian. Unlike in the case of classic autoencoders, VAEs incorporate a probabilistic framework that lets them generalize even better and further allows generating new samples from the distribution they learned. Overall, VAEs do quite well on all kinds of applications, which involve generation and learning of representation.\nIn particular, VAEs have been very successful in time-series data analysis with respect to the tasks of anomaly detection and data denoising [4, 23]. Because the VAEs learn the representations of data concerning latent patterns, normal fluctuations differ from abnormal events, which resemble sudden spikes. Probabilistic representation gives much better results in the application, where nonlinear dependencies are important and difficult to model using standard linear"}, {"title": "2.2 Mechanism of VAEs and Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAES", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.2.1 Mechanism of Variational Autoencoders", "content": "The VAEs framework is based on two simple building blocks: the encoder and the decoder [10, 20]. The encoder maps the input, given by x, to a lower-dimensional latent space z, while the decoder reconstructs the input using this latent variable, x.

The fundamentally useful process of iteration will be particularly enhanced in the latent representation that normally captures features very effectively from complex and noisy data, with the example being the DART time series. The features observed by the model will be refined through several iterations in learning to differentiate normal patterns from anomalous features, with the process realizing optimum spike elimination and assuring maximum performance.\nThe single-cycle encoding-decoding output is fed back with the Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs. In other words, such iterative feedback in the processes allows the latent representation to be developed, thus causing quality improvement within some predefined steps. The iterative approach, within the same essence as the standard VAEs, initiates exploration into the data's underlying structure deeper.

This adaptive dropout strategy can prevent overfitting without sacrificing model flexibility.\nThe final output of the encoder is the latent space representation, which is a 16-dimensional feature vector defined through empirical studies. In preparation for this latent space, parallel dense layers are used to predict the mean (\u03bc) and the log-variance (log \u03c3\u00b2), so that the reparameterization trick can be used:\n$z = \\mu + \\sigma \\odot \\epsilon, \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$\nwhere denotes element-wise multiplication."}, {"title": "3.2 Training Strategy", "content": "The Iterative Encoding-Decoding VAEs model was implemented from scratch to utilize multi-GPUs for accelerated training.

Scaling the batch size linearly with the number of GPUs ensures that each GPU is utilized effectively, maximizing computational throughput and reducing the overall training time.\nThe all-reduce algorithm was applied for synchronizing the gradients: all aggregate gradients are updated across all GPUs to maintain model updates consistently. This step is consistent with model convergence, ensuring the best performance once training has been divided across multiple GPUs devices.\nTraining Hardware: One NVIDIA RTX 3090 and two NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPUs are utilized for the model. Thus, the code distributed training work among those GPUs and reduced overall training time.

Introduction", "content": "Understanding how individuals form cognitive and emotional associations with STEM\n(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines is essential for improving\nstudent engagement and addressing barriers to success in these fields (Abramski et al., 2023).\nNegative emotions, such as anxiety and frustration, are common in STEM education and have\nbeen shown to lead to avoidance behaviour, reduced academic achievement, and growing\ndisinterest in pursuing STEM careers (Ashcraft, 2002; Pekrun, 2006). Given the critical role\nSTEM plays in driving innovation and economic growth, these trends pose significant\nchallenges to the development of a skilled workforce capable of addressing future societal\nneeds (Luo et al., 2021). Stereotypical negative beliefs about STEM careers (e.g. that a career\nin STEM involves boring work in unpleasant, isolated surroundings) worsen this issue by\nnegatively influencing students' interest in STEM and their expectations regarding STEM-\nrelated professions. Negative outcome expectations, such as perceiving STEM careers as\nunachievable, unrewarding or incompatible with personal interests, reduce the appeal of STEM\nprofessions (Luo et al., 2021). Together, these factors create a feedback loop where stereotypes\nreinforce negative attitudes, discouraging students from entering STEM fields and worsening\nworkforce shortages (Ashcraft, 2002; Pekrun, 2006).\nStudies have shown that learners often develop fragmented or limited understanding of\nSTEM topics, which can increase feelings of anxiety and disengagement (Haim et al., 2024a;\nKubat & Guray, 2018; Vosniadou, 1994). Additionally, emotions are deeply intertwined with\ncognitive processes, shaping how individuals perceive, retain, and engage with STEM-related\nmaterial (Immordino-Yang & Damasio, 2007). By exploring these associations, educators can"}, {"title": "Manuscript aims, research questions and outline", "content": "In this study, we use behavioural forma mentis networks (rather than textual forma\nmentis networks, as discussed by Haim et al., 2025) to explore the mindsets of different groups,\nfocusing on PhD students and experts in STEM fields. We further subdivide the expert group\ninto academics (research professors) and industrial professionals (experts working outside of\nacademia). This allows us to investigate how individuals with various levels of expertise and\nprofessional experience structure their own mindset, i.e. ways of associating and perceiving\nideas related to STEM subjects. Furthermore, we use GPT-3.5 alongside human participants to\ninvestigate how Al\u00b4s cognitive structures align with those of trainees, academics, and industrial\nexperts, thus obtaining a baseline for discovering potential biases and limitations in both human\nand AI-generated associative networks (Stella et al., 2023).\nOur study has two goals. Firstly, it aims to explore the cognitive and emotional\nassociations that students, experts and academics form with concepts in STEM (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, and Mathematics). To achieve this, a behavioural forma mentis task\nwas used, i.e. a continuous free word association task followed by a valence rating task. In the\nfree association part, participants were presented with a series of STEM-related cue words and\nasked to respond with the first word or concept that came to mind. This method allowed for the\nmapping of associative networks that reflect the participants' cognitive structures and emotional\nperceptions of these disciplines. Secondly, this study also aims to compare the cognitive\nstructures and emotional associations of STEM concepts between human participants and an"}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": "The data collection took place online through a Shiny R application. For the human\nparticipants, a total of 209 individuals took part in the study. However, participants who left\nmore than 25% of the responses blank, excluding the valence scores, were excluded from the\nfinal analysis. This left a total of 177 valid participants whose responses were used in the study.\nThey were categorised into three groups: trainees (students at various levels, including PhD\nstudents), experts (professionals working outside of academia) and academics (those with a\nPhD degree and/or working at a university or as teachers). For the final analysis, 59 responses\nfrom trainees, 57 from experts, and 61 from academics were retained (52% female),\nrepresenting over 25 different nationalities.\nThis study received the ethics approval from Warwick University (Ethical Application\nReference: 09/17-18 approved by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Sub-\nCommittee of Warwick University).\nFor the GPT dataset, the same group distribution was replicated with GPT imitating 59\ntrainees, 57 experts and 61 academics.

To analyse the structural properties\nof group-level BFMNs, we considered four common network measures: average shortest path\nlength (ASPL), diameter, modularity, and clustering coefficient (CC). These measures have\nbeen widely used in cognitive network research to assess the organization and connectivity of\nconceptual representations (Haim & Stella, 2023; Siew et al., 2019b).\nASPL quantifies the average number of steps required to travel between nodes in a\nnetwork, capturing how closely interconnected concepts are and reflects the efficiency of\ninformation transfer. This measure has been linked to cognitive processing, with longer path\nlengths associated with slower reaction times and increased perceived dissimilarity between\nconcepts (Kenett et al., 2018; Newman, 2010).\nIn contrast, network diameter, another global measure of distance, represents the\nlongest shortest path between any two nodes in the network. While ASPL reflects the average\nnumber of steps it takes to travel the shortest distance between any two given nodes, diameter"}, {"title": "3.

We generated 500 configuration\nmodels, i.e. random graphs with the same degree sequence as the original networks (Newman,\n2018).

Although our study included a range of trainees, experts and academics, the\nrelatively small sample sizes (~ 60 participants in each group) may not properly represent these\npopulations. Similarly, GPT-3.5\u00b4s simulations of these groups were not informed by additional\ndemographic factors like age, gender or cultural background, which could limit GPT-3.5's\nassociative and emotional patterns during the simulations.\nFurthermore, while the use of clustering coefficients and semantic frames provided\nmeaningful insights, our analysis focused primarily on macro-level network metrics.\nAdditional micro-level measures, such as node centrality or measures of distance, might reveal\nfurther nuances in associative structures.\nFuture research could focus on enhancing GPT-3.5\u2032s capacity to form richer and more\ninterconnected networks, by improving its ability to model complex relationships between\nconcepts.

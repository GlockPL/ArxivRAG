However, quantifying the privacy norm\nawareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication\nis challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive\ncases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application\nscenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework\ndesigned to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further\ninto agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM\nagents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms\ngrounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we\nreveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and\ntheir actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-\nthe-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68%\nand 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions.\nWe also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed\ninto multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

Equipped with tool use or retrieval-augmented generation\ncapabilities, LMs can access sensitive data at inference time. Consequently, their unawareness of\nthe privacy norms, i.e., the appropriateness of the data flow in the data sharing context [38], could\nlead to unintentional privacy leakage, even without malicious attackers involved. For example,\nas illustrated in Figure 1, it is undesirable for an LM agent to share the information that John is\n\"talking to a few companies about switching jobs\" when assisting John in sending an \u201cemail\" to\n\"John's manager\" without John's explicit consent. It is challenging to balance the LM's agency with\nusers' privacy expectations, because the privacy management process may involve respecting privacy\nnorms in context and taking into account individual preferences and knowledge [53]. This raises an\nemerging privacy risk that differs from widely studied risk models with intentional attackers, such as\ntraining data extraction [6, 37] and membership inference attacks (MIA) [31, 10, 27].\nRecent efforts to evaluate the privacy reasoning capabilities of LMs involve probing them with\ntargeted questions [33, 52, 25]. While such evaluation setups are straightforward to implement and\noffer essential insights, such as LMs' sensitivity to privacy-related words and their ability to determine\ninformation accessibility, a growing amount of work has highlighted a potential disconnection between\nLMs' performance on these probing tasks and their actual behavior in applications [20, 29, 11, 42].\nWe focus on evaluating LMs' privacy norm awareness in action by grounding our setup in a critical\nfamily of applications, i.e., LM agents that directly interact with tools such as users' calendar\nor email. Compared to single-turn probing questions, such evaluation requires collecting agent\ntrajectories, which demands expert construction due to the complex logic involved [57]. It is even\nmore challenging to evaluate them from a privacy perspective because it focuses on worst-case\nscenarios that may be very rare but consequential [35]. Moreover, privacy sensitivity is context-\ndependent. In Figure 1's example, the data flow would turn acceptable if the information comes from\na virtual meeting transcript where the manager is also present, rather than from the user's personal\ncalendar without the user's explicit consent. Generating such contexts can be difficult, as they are\ninherently unstructured and subject to subtle changes [38].\nWe address these challenges by proposing PrivacyLens, a procedural data construction and multi-\nlevel evaluation framework to evaluate privacy norm awareness of LMs in action. PrivacyLens\nstarts with collecting privacy norms using a generic schema informed by the Contextual Integrity\ntheory [38]. This theoretical framework helps characterize privacy norms with nuanced consideration\nof who the information is about, the social relationship between the sender and the recipient, and\nthe method of information transmission [4]. To evaluate LMs in action, we use these norms as\nprivacy-sensitive seeds (Figure 1 Left) and employ a template-based generation method to expand\nthem into expressive vignettes describing scenarios where the sensitive data transmission could\nhappen. Finally, we build a simulated sandbox environment where the LM agent can interact with a\nset of tools (e.g., email, calendar, personal notebook, etc.) to further obtain agent trajectories from the\nseed and vignette (Figure 1 Right)."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Language Model Privacy As shown in Table 1, previous research on evaluating LM privacy has\nfocused on whether these models memorize training data and if malicious attackers can extract\nsensitive information from them [6, 26, 60, 10]. However, privacy risks go beyond memorization [5].\nAs LMs are increasingly applied to complex everyday tasks, private information can be easily exposed\nat inference time. These models may share such information in their generated texts, potentially\nviolating social norms specific to the context [13]. Accordingly, prior work has focused on testing\nattribute inference or privacy-sensitive prompt injection, yet lacks systematic studies of LM privacy\nrisks [48, 52]. The most relevant work is ConfAIde [33], which evaluates whether LMs can reason\nabout contextual privacy. However, ConfAIde primarily employs probing questions and only covers\na single application of meeting summary and action-item generation with 20 test cases. Thus, it\nremains unclear whether LMs could unintentionally leak sensitive information presented at inference\ntime in agentic applications. In this work, we propose PrivacyLens to study this emerging LM privacy\nleakage risk.\nEvaluating Language Model Agents\nRecent advancements in LMs have\nled to their rapid expansion in agent-\nbased applications. Current LM agent\nbenchmarks typically evaluate their\ncapabilities across various domains,\nincluding web environments [55, 58,\n9], game playing [54], coding [23, 28,\n45], social interactions [59], etc. [19,\n30, 44]. However, in addition to high\ntask completion rates, an ideal LM\nagent should also consider the conse-\nquences of its actions when complet-\ning tasks on behalf of the user. To this\nend, Naihin et al. [35] and Yuan et al. [57] manually craft risky agent trajectories to assess whether\nLMs can be used to monitor or judge unsafe actions of LM agents. This manual approach is labor-\nintensive and prone to becoming outdated due to issues of data contamination. Addressing this, Ruan\net al. [41] proposes ToolEmu, an LM-based emulation framework designed to evaluate tool-use LM\nagents. Despite these developments, to the best of our knowledge, no existing research focuses on\nevaluating LM agent actions from the privacy perspective.\nLanguage Model Assisted Evaluation Given the high costs and limited coverage of human-\nannotated datasets, previous studies have leveraged the instruction-following ability of LMs to\ngenerate test cases for assisting the evaluation of LMs themselves [17, 12, 15]. More recent work\nfurther develops data construction framework using LMs to discover novel test cases [40], facilitate\nred teaming [39], and understand social reasoning in LMs [14]. Drawing inspiration from these\nadvancements, our work introduces a procedural data construction pipeline that utilizes LMs to\nconstruct vignettes and LM agent trajectories from privacy-sensitive seeds."}, {"title": "3 PrivacyLens", "content": "In this section, we define the risk model that serves as the focus of our evaluation (\u00a73.1), the Priva-\ncyLens framework, which comprises a procedural data construction pipeline (\u00a73.2) and multi-level\nevaluation of LM privacy norm awareness (\u00a73.3). Appendix F documents prompts in PrivacyLens.\n3.1 Risk Model behind Privacy Lens\nPrivacyLens focuses on the emerging unintentional LM privacy leakage risk caused by the privacy\nnorm unawareness of LMs. Our risk model (depicted in Figure 1) involves three primary actors: (1)"}, {"title": "3.2 Data Construction Pipeline", "content": "Collecting Contextual Privacy Seeds To quantify the privacy norm awareness of LMs in action, we\nstart with privacy-sensitive seeds that encapsulate a privacy-norm-violating scenario [18]. Drawing\nfrom the Contextual Integrity theory, we define the privacy-sensitive seed $S$ with a 5-tuple: (1) $data$\ntype, the attribute or information type; (2) $data$\nsubject, the subject of the information that is being\ntransferred; (3) $data$\nsender, the sender of the information; (4) $data$\nrecipient, the recipient of the\ninformation; (5) $transmission$\nprinciple, the information transmission method or condition imposed.\nThe seed $S$ delineates potentially inappropriate information transmissions and specifying all five\nelements makes the seed contextual, as altering any single element could shift the expected privacy\nnorms (see Appendix B.2 for examples).\nExtending Contextual Seed into Vignette Although our theory-based schema enables the privacy-\nsensitive seeds to be contextual, these seeds have limited details. For instance, the seed in Figure 1\ndoes not specify the circumstances under which John emails his manager. To evaluate whether LMs\ncan identify potentially sensitive data transmissions in detailed scenarios, we extend the seed into a\nvignette $V$, i.e., a short story, using a template-based generation method with GPT-4. The vignette\n(Figure 2 (B)) includes more details to reflect the real-world complexity.\nSince vignettes are extended from privacy-sensitive seeds, direct generations from GPT-4 often\ninclude terms explicitly indicating sensitivity, e.g., \u201csensitive\u201d, \u201cprivate\u201d, \u201cconfidential\u201d. However,\nprivate issues in daily communication are typically implicit and nuanced. To mirror such subtleties,\nwe require that the generated vignettes exclude these restricted words. To achieve this, we introduce\na Surgery Kit module that refines model outputs to meet specific criteria established by unit tests. As\noutlined in Algorithm 1, this module takes in the initial output alongside a set of unit tests, and uses\nan LM to refine the text based on the repair instruction associated with the failed test. In vignette\ngeneration, we define a deterministic keyword detection function as the unit test and instruct the LM\nto remove these keywords when the test fails.\nConstructing Executable Agent Trajectory To\ncollect agent trajectories at scale, we develop a\nsandbox environment leveraging ToolEmu [41].\nWithin the sandbox, the LM agent can interact\nwith a suite of tools, e.g., calendar, email, social\nmedia, personal notebook, etc. (see Appendix C\nfor details), by generating a series of actions $a$\ntowards fulfilling the user instruction $i$. The ob-\nservations $o$ from these tool interactions are gen-\nerated by a GPT-4 emulator, eliminating the need\nto rely on real user data within the sandbox. Af-\nter multiple interactions between the LM agent\nand the sandbox emulator, we obtain an agent tra-\njectory $\\{a_1, o_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, o_{n-1}, a_n\\}$, which ulti-\nmately completes $i$ with the final action $a_n$. To pre-\npare this trajectory for evaluation across different\nLMs, we remove the final action $a_n$ (e.g., sending\nan email or message) where data transfer occurs.\nThe whole process results in an executable trajec-\ntory $T = \\{a_1, o_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}, o_{n-1}\\}$ as a compo-\nnent of each data point in PrivacyLens.\nTo enhance worst-case evaluation efficiency, we\nincorporate risk-triggering elements into trajectory\nconstruction. Based on our risk model (\u00a73.1), we use GPT-4 to generate an underspecified user\ninstruction $i$ given each privacy-sensitive seed $S$ and its corresponding vignette $V$. The sandbox\nemulator is instructed to generate observations based on $S$ and $V$, thus creating adversarial scenarios\nthat are likely to expose privacy risks. To ensure these agent trajectories do not have placeholders and\nreflect the intended privacy-sensitive contexts, we again utilize the Surgery Kit module. This module\nedits each $o$ locally to eliminate placeholders and globally refines $T$ to enhance its alignment with $S$."}, {"title": "3.3 Multi-Level Evaluation", "content": "PrivacyLens evaluates LM privacy awareness in two ways, with $S, V$ and $T$ in each data point:\nProbing in Question-Answering Format We first assess LMs on their ability to identify sensitive\ndata transmission through probing in QA format. For $S$ and $V$ of each data point, we prompt the\nLM to answer \u201cIs it acceptable for {data sender} to share {data subject}'s {data type} with {data\nrecipient} by {transmission principle}?\u201d This probing question is taken from Shvartzshnaider et al.\n[47], which was originally used to survey human privacy expectations. For the agent trajectory $T$, we\nformulate the probing question by emphasizing the agent is sending information on behalf of the user,\nas exemplified in Figure 3. Since $S$ is privacy-sensitive and $V, T$ are constructed from it, we expect\nthe LM to answer \u201cNo\u201d for all these probing questions. We use accuracy as the metric.\nEvaluating LMs in Action with Agent Setup Next, we evaluate LMs in action with agent\ntrajectories. For each trajectory $T$, we prompt the LM to generate the final action, denoted as $a_f$, to\ncomplete the corresponding user instruction. We evaluate whether $a_f$ leaks any information about\nthe data type in $S$. To streamline the evaluation process, we extract a list of sensitive information\nitems, $I(T, S) = \\{i_1, \\ldots, i_m\\}$, from trajectory $T$ based on its corresponding seed $S$. We build an\nLM-based few-shot classifier $f$ to judge whether each information item can be inferred from the\naction. $a_f$ leaks the information if $\\exists t \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m\\}$, $i_t$ can be inferred from $a_f$. The leakage rate\n(LR) on the evaluation dataset $D$ is defined as the percentage of $a_f$ that leaks the information:\n$$LR = \\frac{\\sum_{(S, V, T) \\in D} 1{\\{\\exists i_t : f(i_t, a_f)\\}\\, |\\, t = 1, \\ldots, m\\}}}{|D|}$$\n(1)"}, {"title": "4 Instantiating PrivacyLens", "content": "We now apply PrivacyLens to curate an evaluation dataset. We collect privacy norms in common\ninterpersonal communication in the U.S. from different sources, spanning from legal norms to\nsocial norms, and from specialized community norms to those of the general public (Figure 2 (A)).\nConcretely, we use GPT-4 to extract privacy-sensitive seeds from 15 U.S. privacy regulations covering\nrules that govern specific types of data (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, GLBA) and various occupations (e.g.,\nAMA Code of Medical Ethics) to collect legal norms, as well as from privacy research papers curated\nin Sannon and Forte [43] that focus on vulnerable groups.\nTo scale up the seed collection, we conduct crowdsourcing through Prolific. Specifically, we pre-\nfill the transmission principle with online communication activities and enumerate different social\nrelationships\u00b2 and occupations\u00b3 for the data sender and recipient fields. Participants are then tasked to\nbrainstorm data types and data subjects that would make the seed violate privacy norms. More details\nabout the seed collection process are included in Appendix B. After gathering seeds from various\nsources, we conduct a validation phase (Appendix B.3) where annotators remove unclear seeds and\nlabel whether each clearly described seed represents a privacy-sensitive case. Each seed receives\nthree annotations, and we consider it valid if at least two annotators label it as privacy-sensitive. The\ninter-annotator agreement, measured by Fleiss' Kappa, is 0.79, indicating substantial agreement.\nThrough the whole process, we collect a total of 493 valid privacy-sensitive seeds. We then use\nPrivacyLens to extend each seed into one vignette and trajectory. Notably, PrivacyLens' dynamic\nnature allows mapping a single seed to multiple vignettes and trajectories-a capability that we will\nexplore in \u00a75.3. For cases where the Surgery Kit module returns a false success flag $s$ when setting\nthe maximum iterations $n$ to 2, the authors manually fix the generated vignettes and trajectories. The\ncurated dataset has been manually reviewed by the authors to ensure the data quality.\nExtensibility While we use this dataset for our main evaluation experiments, as an extensible\nframework, PrivacyLens can also be instantiated with other seed collections. In Appendix D, we\ndemonstrate this extensibility by applying PrivacyLens to convert seeds from a privacy-related dataset\n[33] and a cultural knowledge base [46] into contextualized data points. Our experimental results on\nthem further expose significant LM privacy leakage across scenarios collected in prior datasets."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": "5.1 Evaluation Setup\nEvaluated Models We test four closed-source LMs: ChatGPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106), GPT-\n4 (gpt-4-1106-preview) [2], Claude-3-Haiku (claude-3-haiku-20240307), Claude-3-Sonnet\n(claude-3-sonnet-20240229) [3]; and five open-source LMs, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 [21],\nMixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 [22], zephyr-7b-beta [51], Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Meta-Llama-3-\n70B-Instruct. All models are used with a temperature of 0. We apply the chat template to the\nopen-source LMs and run inferences with 4 A100 80GB GPUs.\nPrompting Details For all the probing questions, we use zero shot prompts as shown in Figure 3.\nFor evaluating LMs in action, we implement LM agents with ReAct [56] which requires the LM to\noutput \"thought\" before generating the action and use the system prompt in ToolEmu [41] (denoted\nas \"Basic Prompt\"). To evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering, we also experiment\nwith another system prompt that directly instructs the LM agent to preserve privacy (denoted as\n\"Privacy-Enhancing Prompt\"). All the prompts we use are documented in Appendix F.\nDetails of Evaluating LMs in Action We use leakage rate (LR, see Eq. 1) to quantify the LM\nprivacy leakage in action. We obtain $I(T, S)$ by instructing Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 to extract\nfacts from the trajectory $T$ that are related to the data type in $S$. The authors manually ensure the\nquality of $I(T, S)$, as this computation only needs to be performed once. To determine whether each\ninformation item in $I(T, S)$ can be inferred from the final action $a_f$, we build a few-shot classifier $f$\nusing the same Mistral model. We validate $f$ by randomly sampling 50 final actions from different\nLMs we test and having 4 annotators label whether an action leaks certain information on 153 pairs\nin total. The Fleiss' Kappa between $f$ and the human majority vote is 0.82; using the human majority\nvote as ground truth, the model's accuracy in judging whether $a_f$ leaks information is 0.92.\nAdjusting Leakage Rate to Consider Safety-Helpfulness Trade-off There is a trade-off between\nsafety and helpfulness, and LR alone may favor models that perform poorly in executing user\ninstructions. To address this, we use the same Mistral model to assign a helpfulness score to $\\alpha_T$,\nassessing whether the action achieves the user instruction. We use the same rubric as ToolEmu [41],\nwhere scores of 0 (Poor) and 1 (Unsatisfactory) correspond to a negative case, and scores of 2 (Good)\nand 3 (Excellent) correspond to a positive case. On the same set of 50 final actions, the agreement\nbetween the model's judgment and the human majority vote in terms of the binary label is 0.56 with\nFleiss' Kappa. We also report the adjusted leakage rate $LR_h = \\frac{\\# \\text{leakage cases with positive helpfulness}}{\\# \\text{total cases with positive helpfulness}}$.\n5.2 Results\nWe present the evaluation results\nof QA probing in Figure 4 and\nLM agent actions in Table 2.\nQA probing at different levels\nWhen we move from seeds to\nLM agent trajectories, the prob-\ning accuracy of weaker models\ndrops significantly (e.g., Mistral-\n7B 94.32% \u2192 63.29%, Llama-\n3-8B 88.84% \u2192 31.44%). This\nmay be due to the complex-\nity of grasping relevant context\nfrom the trajectory and process-\ning long sequences. Stronger\nmodels (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3,\nLlama-3-70B) perform consistently well on QA probing evaluation at all three levels.\nDiscrepancy between probing accuracy and action-based evaluation While strong LMs gener-\nally perform well in QA probing evaluation, a huge discrepancy exists between how they judge data\ntransmission appropriateness and their actual behavior in the LM agent setup. Comparing probing\naccuracy and leakage rates in Table 2, models like GPT-4 and Claude-3-Sonnet answer almost all\ntrajectory-level probing questions correctly yet leak the sensitive information on 27.23% and 38.83%"}, {"title": "Effect of scaling", "content": "While increasing model size is effective for improving performance on many tasks,\ncomparing the results between Claude-3-Haiku and Claude-3-Sonnet, as well as Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nand Llama-3-70B-Instruct, we find that larger models can perform better on probing evaluation but\nnot on the action-based evaluation. Larger models still tend to leak sensitive information in the final\naction without properly considering privacy norms.\nEffect of prompt engineering We evaluate two prompt types, \u201cBasic\u201d and \u201cPrivacy-Enhancing\",\nat the trajectory level (see Appendix F.2.1, F.2.2 for the full prompts). While the privacy-enhancing\nprompt improves probing results, it does not significantly boost performance in action-based evalua-\ntion.

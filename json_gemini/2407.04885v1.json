However, as tools like machine learning (ML) evolve, they present key opportunities to supplement VC funds' analyses and improve their investment strategies. Increasingly popular large language models (LLMs) can also support this process by quickly extracting insights from data that is otherwise difficult to parse.\nThis paper aims to introduce potential pathways for using ML and LLMs to predict the success of new startup founders. We leverage LLMs to propose and apply new features based on limited founder data that reflects the information available when a VC firm considers funding a company. We then use these features to gain insights and make predictions about startup success, demonstrating the vast potential for LLMs in this space."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Dataset", "content": "The original dataset comprised two CSV files respectively containing information about 1022 successful and 2694 unsuccessful startup founders. These founders are based in the United States and founded companies in 2010 or later. For the purpose of this paper, \"success\" means that the founder's company had an initial public offering with a valuation over $500M, was acquired for over $500M, or raised over $500M and is still operating.\nThe features of interest in the raw data were linkedin_json (all information from a founder's LinkedIn profile formatted in JSON) and org_name (the name of the founder's company). The use of these variables is described further in the following sections.\nTo prepare for the prediction of founder success, we combined the two original CSV files into one pandas dataframe and created a boolean flag column called success to distinguish successful and unsuccessful founders. To make the data more manageable for the LLMs, we worked with a random sample containing\n1"}, {"title": "2.2 Feature engineering", "content": "Engineering features from the raw data involved several steps, including parsing the data through code and using an LLM, specifically OpenAI's GPT-40, to extract key information."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Processing education data", "content": "Initially, more traditional techniques were used to extract educational information about each founder from their LinkedIn data. First, we parsed the LinkedIn data to determine each degree that a founder received and used this information to encode a variable, highest_edu, indicating the highest degree received by the founder. Each education level was mapped to an integer, as shown in Table 1."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Founder summaries", "content": "The rest of the feature engineering process involved significant use of LLMs and prompting techniques, starting with the generation of summaries about each founder. Given a founder's LinkedIn data and latest company name, the LLM was prompted to provide a detailed summary of the founder including their education, location, skills, and employment history. The prompt emphasized that the model should focus on the time before the founder started their company, as this is the only information that would be available if a venture capitalist was assessing a new founder in a real-life situation."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Level segmentation", "content": ""}, {"title": "Generating levels", "content": "Previous research has segmented startup founders into five different categories, from L1 to L5, describing founders' level of experience and achievement in areas related to startup success. To provide more detailed insights, we used an unsupervised LLM-based method to increase the degree of segmentation to ten levels. The LLM was fed fifty founder summaries (generated in the previous section) and asked to propose a list of ten levels building upon the existing list of five. See the appendix for the specific prompt used to propose the ten levels.\nWe then refined the descriptions of the ten levels to improve specificity and the LLM's ability to produce correct outputs. The levels are as follows:\n\u2022 Level 10 (L10): Serial entrepreneurs who have successfully founded and exited multiple companies, each with significant funding and valuation, typically above 100M+, and are consistently successful in scaling companies to IPO or large exits.\n\u2022 Level 9 (L9): Entrepreneurs who have previously led unicorn (valuation > $1B) startups, before founding their current company.\n\u2022 Level 8 (L8): Founders known for groundbreaking innovation, who have significantly disrupted or created new markets. Often recognized as thought leaders within the tech industry.\n\u2022 Level 7 (L7): Founders who have previously scaled startups, securing substantial funding (50M-100M) and paving the way for potential IPO or major exit.\n\u2022 Level 6 (L6): Founders who have had medium to large-sized exits and may have held key executive roles in notable tech companies.\n\u2022 Level 5 (L5): Founders whose previous companies have secured substantial funding (100M+) with pending IPOs.\n\u2022 Level 4 (L4): Founders with successful small to medium-sized exits or significant roles at notable technology companies.\n\u2022 Level 3 (L3): Individuals with 10-15 years of technical and management expertise, including significant roles at high-growth tech companies or unicorn startups. May include academia with a PhD in relevant fields.\n\u2022 Level 2 (L2): Founders with a few years of startup experience prior to founding their company, possibly graduates of well-known accelerator programs.\n\u2022 Level 1 (L1): Founders who are relatively new to the tech industry, potentially with negligible experience but demonstrating high potential."}, {"title": "Categorizing founders by level", "content": "After finalizing these levels, we implemented prompt chaining, feeding the previously generated founder summaries into an LLM so that it could categorize each founder as one of these levels. Then, level-based success rates were calculated by determining the number of founders within each level that were deemed to be successful.\nThis process utilized chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to build on the few-shot technique. Few-shot CoT involves providing an example of the input, output, and reasoning that the LLM should follow to produce that output."}, {"title": "2.2.4 Persona segmentation", "content": ""}, {"title": "Generating personas", "content": "The process of persona segmentation mimics that of level segmentation. Prior research has worked with ten personas describing key characteristics of founders beyond the information provided by level segmentation. Using a very similar unsupervised method to the previous section, we prompted the LLM to suggest a list of twenty personas based on the existing categories and fifty founder summaries.\nAfter adjusting the wording for improved results, the final personas are as follows:\n(A) Successful serial entrepreneur who built a public company.\n(B) Successful serial entrepreneur who had a company with exit over $100M.\n(C) Fresh graduate entrepreneur who founded a company immediately or within a year after university.\n(D) First-time entrepreneur who founded a company within 3-5 years of finishing university.\n(E) Founder holds a PhD degree or is/was a researcher, or is/was a professor at a university.\n(F) First-time non-tech entrepreneur with 10+ years of experience in non-tech industries.\n(G) Tech executive at tech company/companies for over 10 years.\n(H) Engineer/executive at a unicorn company.\n(I) Founder who has a background as an engineer or product manager at a tech firm.\n(J) Founder with an MBA.\n(K) Founder who has lived or worked in multiple countries.\n(L) Serial entrepreneur with at least two companies started before.\n(M) Founder who came from a corporate background but with less than 10 years of total experience.\n(N) Founder with a background in finance, accounting, or economics.\n(O) Founder who pivoted career paths from arts/humanities to tech entrepreneurship.\n(P) Founder with experience in nonprofit organizations or social entrepreneurship.\n(Q) Founder who has received notable awards or recognition in their industry (e.g., Forbes 30 under 30).\n(R) Founder with a military service background.\n(S) Female founder with notable achievements in male-dominated industries.\n(T) Any others that are not in the above categories.\nIt is important to acknowledge that the use of unsupervised Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques may result in the generation of biased personas, such as (R). For the purposes of this research, we have elected to present the outputs of the unsupervised technique. This transparency aims to provide valuable insights that can inform the development of our future AI modeling techniques with a focus on ethical guardrails in our prompting constructs."}, {"title": "Categorizing founders by persona", "content": "Once again, we implemented prompt chaining and few-shot CoT prompting to generate persona labels for each founder in the dataset.

As stated above, test set 1 contains 28 unsuccessful and two successful founders, and test set 2 contains 15 of each group.\nAccuracy is simply the proportion of correct predictions among an entire test dataset. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions that is, the proportion of startups that a VC supports that become successful. The F1 score aims to assess predictive performance by taking the harmonic mean of accuracy and precision. Finally, TPR indicates the True Positive Rate, equal to $\\frac{true\\ positives}{true\\ positives + false\\ negatives}$. In context, this metric is the proportion of founders that a VC fund chooses out of the total pool of successful founders.\nIn general, based on these metrics, linear regression performs better on the dataset with 28 unsuccessful and two successful founders whereas the other models perform better on the evenly-split dataset. The random forest model also performs better than XGBoost overall.\nAmong these metrics, precision is likely the most important in the context of venture capital, as one of the main goals of VC funds is to maximize the proportion of successful startups in their portfolio. By this measure, either linear regression or random forest seems to be the best model depending on the makeup of the dataset being used for prediction. When there are few successful founders in the data, linear regression performs best, with a precision of 18.2%. However, given a more evenly split dataset, random forest is very effective, with a precision of 70.6%."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Conclusions", "content": "The features engineered for the purpose of predicting startup success meaning being valued at $500M in some way appear very promising. When receiving these features as inputs, all machine learning models explored in this paper perform relatively well, particularly in the context of venture capital and investment. Additionally, the success rates of different founder classifications such as the high success rate of founders with military backgrounds suggest notable relationships between certain founder characteristics and their ability to scale a startup."}, {"title": "4.2 Limitations and future directions", "content": "One limitation in the sampling and prediction process is that founders were considered individually, regardless of whether started their company with a co-founder. Predictions about startup success were made assuming that the given individual was the only founder of the company. However, the characteristics of the entire founding team likely contribute to a startup's success, so our models' predictive ability might be more limited for multi-founder companies.\nAnother limitation is the reliability of large language models. Although some initial LLM outputs were reviewed manually to ensure correctness and adjust the prompts as needed, not all 300 instances in the sample were inspected in this manner. This somewhat limits the confidence in the results. For instance, there may be inaccuracies in the founders' total years of work experience as outputted by the LLM. The model calculated these figures by summing the durations of a founder's previous jobs, but some jobs may overlap, leading to an overestimation of the number of years in the professional world.\nAn additional finding about this research is that one of the persona categories, (S), pertains to whether a founder is female. This persona was generated in an unsupervised manner without human intervention. We kept this persona in this research to flag potential issues with LLMs while making decisions in an autonomous way. This is especially important as many firms are introducing autonomous AI agents to augment decision making in their investment decision processes.\nFuture research should address these limitations by considering the interactions between the characteristics of co-founders and further refining the prompting strategies. Future research can also examine the importance of certain features in determining startup success. The success rate analysis in this study and prior studies continue to suggest that there are many hidden features that are related to success than others. Therefore, this research topic should be further pursued."}]}

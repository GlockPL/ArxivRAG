This suggests a more dynamic but potentially volatile learning process in the PDE model.\n5. Robustness: Transformer models demonstrate superior robustness to input perturbations compared to PDE models, highlighting an area where PDE frameworks need improvement to fully capture Transformer characteristics.\nThese experiments collectively demonstrate that while PDE models offer valuable insights into Transformer behavior and can effectively simulate many aspects of Transformer architectures, they also have limitations. The PDE framework excels in capturing general information flow patterns and attention mechanisms but falls short in replicating the robustness and some of the complex, non-linear behaviors of Transformers.Our findings suggest that PDE models can serve as useful tools for understanding and analyzing Transformer architectures, providing a complementary perspective to traditional neural network analysis. However, further refinements are necessary to fully bridge the gap between PDE models and Transformers, particularly in areas such as robustness to perturbations and handling of complex, non-linear transformations.\nFuture work should focus on enhancing PDE models to better mimic the stability and robustness of Transformers while maintaining their interpretability and analytical advantages. This could involve developing more sophisticated PDE formulations, incorporating additional mechanisms inspired by Transformer architectures, or exploring hybrid models that combine the strengths of both approaches."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion And Discussion", "content": "This paper presents a novel approach to understanding Transformer architectures by modeling their information flow using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering a continuous and mathematically rigorous framework that enhances interpretability. The PDE model successfully captures key aspects of Transformer behavior, including information propagation, attention mechanisms, and information compression.. Future research could explore modifications to the Transformer architecture based on PDE principles, such as adjusting layer interactions or improving attention mechanisms using diffusion models. Additionally, hybrid models that combine the strengths of both PDEs and Transformers could be developed to enhance interpretability, stability, and robustness in deep learning architectures.\nIn summary, this research provides a foundation for further exploration into using PDEs to analyze and improve Transformer models, contributing to both their theoretical understanding and practical application in complex tasks."}, {"title": "A.1 Improved PDE Model", "content": "We begin by introducing an improved PDE model to describe the information flow in Transformers:\n$\\frac{\\partial u"}, {"Conditions": "nu(x, 0) = u0(x) ("}]}

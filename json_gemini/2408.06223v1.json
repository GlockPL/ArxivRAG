Despite its high performance, the underlying cause and explanation remain underexplored. In this paper, we first theoretically demonstrate that steering forget representations in the intermediate layer reduces token confidence, causing LLMs to generate wrong or nonsense responses. Second, we investigate how the coefficient influences the alignment of forget-sample representations with the random direction and hint at the optimal coefficient values for effective unlearning across different network layers. Third, we show that RMU unlearned models are robust against adversarial jailbreak attacks. Last, our empirical analysis shows that RMU is less effective when applied to the middle and later layers in LLMs. To resolve this drawback, we propose Adaptive RMU\u2014a simple yet effective alternative method that makes unlearning effective with most layers.

Despite the immense effort in safety research, LLMs are still vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks and can exhibit unwanted behaviors (Shah et al. 2023; Chao et al. 2023; Zou et al. 2023b; Jones et al. 2023; Yuan et al. 2024; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024).\nMachine Unlearning (Cao and Yang 2015; Chris Jay Hoofnagle and Borgesius 2019; Bourtoule et al. 2021; Nguyen et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024c) has emerged as a promising method for mitigating unforeseen risks in LLMs before deployment.

RMU significantly degrades models' accuracy on forget-tasks, while only slightly affecting the performance on retain-tasks and demonstrates stronger robustness against adversarial jailbreak attacks.

Recently, LLM has shown a tendency to produce a lower (higher) confidence in its incorrect (correct) answers in multiple-choice Q&A (Plaut, Nguyen, and Trinh 2024). Building on previous works, we hypothesized that the logit of generated tokens by RMU models exhibit randomness. As seen by a deep neural network, such randomization signifies low confidence in the logit, resulting in nonsensical or incorrect responses. To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a theoretical analysis of the logits of generated tokens produced by RMU models. To facilitate subsequent analysis, we make the following definition and assumption.\nDefinition 1. (Unlearned model & logit of tokens on unlearned model). Let $f_{k,l} = g^{(k)} \\circ h^{(l)}$ be the transformation from layer $l$ to layer $k$ of network $f$, for any two layers $k \\geq l; l \\in [1...L], k \\in [l + 1...L]$. We define the unlearned model $f_{unlearn} = W(g^{(L)} \\circ h^{(l), steered})$, where $h^{(l),steered}(X_F)$ is the steered representation of forget input $x_F$ at layer $l$ and $W$ is the unembedding matrix. Given a prompt input $X_{F,1:n}$. For a next token $x_{n+1}$, the logit of $x_{n+1}$ obtained from unlearned model $f_{unlearn}$ is defined as:\n$f_{unlearn}(X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n}) = W(g^{(L)} \\circ h^{(l), steered}) (X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n})$\n$= Wg^{(L)} (h^{(l), steered}(X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n}))$\n(2)\nAssumption 1. A well-unlearned model shifts the representation $h^{(l), steered}(x_F)$ of a forget-sample $x_F$ at layer $l$ to a scaled random vector $cu$. More concretely,\n$h^{(l), steered}(x_F) = cu + \\epsilon$,\n(3)\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a small error. Without losing generality, we assume that $\\epsilon$ is sampled from Normal distribution $N(0, \\eta I)$, where $\\eta I$ is the covariance matrix, $\\eta \\in R$.\nProposition 1. If Assumption 1 holds, by Definition 1, the logit of token $X_{n+1}$ generated by unlearned model $f_{unlearn}$ given as $f_{unlearn}(X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n})$ follows the Normal distribution $N (Wg^{(L)}(z), \\eta W\\nabla_zg^{(L)}(z)^T\\nabla_zg^{(L)}(z)W^T)$, where $z = cu$.\nProof. Given Assumption 1, we have:\n$h^{(l), steered}(X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n}) = cu + \\epsilon$,\n(4)\nWe denote $z = cu$. Substituting Eqn. 3 into Eqn. 2, we get:\n$f_{unlearn}(X_{n+1}|X_{F,1:n}) = Wg^{(L)}(z + \\epsilon)$\n(5)"}, {"title": "3.2 The effect of the coefficient on forget-sample representations", "content": "RMU forget loss steers forget-sample representation $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ aligns with a random direction given by $u$ and scales the magnitude of $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ to $c$ (Eqn 1). While vector $u$ is predetermined before unlearning, the magnitude of $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ varies depending on input $X_F$ and specific properties of layer $l$. This raises the following research questions:\nRQ1 (Direction): \u201cHow does the coefficient $c$ influence the alignment between $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ with $u$.\u201d\nRQ2 (Magnitude): \u201cWhat is the optimal value of the coefficient $c$ for effectively unlearning with different layers.\u201d\nUnlearning as minimizing the noise sensitivity. We aim to answer these questions by analyzing the unlearning problem under a noise compression view. We consider the output of a transformation $f_{k,l}$ on input $x$: $f_{k,l}(x) = (g^{(k)}(h^{(l)}(x)) = g^{(k)}(h^{(l)}(x))$. Suppose we compress a noise vector $\\xi$ to the representation $h^{(l)}$ of layer $l$ at an input $x$, then the output become $g^{(k)}(h^{(l)}(x) + \\xi)$. Naturally, if layer $g^{(k)}$ is robust (less sensitive) to noise $\\xi$, then $\\xi$ has a small effect on the output of $g^{(k)}$ i.e. the normalized squared norm\n$\\Phi(g^{(k)}, x) = \\frac{||g^{(k)} (h^{(l)}(x) + \\xi) - g^{(k)} (h^{(l)}(x)) ||^2}{||g^{(k)} (h^{(l)}(x)) ||^2}$ (8)\nis small. In contrast, a higher $\\Phi(g^{(k)}, x)$ mean $g^{(k)}$ is higher sensitive to noise $\\xi$ at input $x$. For a dataset $D_{forget}$, we define the noise sensitivity of a layer $g^{(k)}$ w.r.t $\\xi$ on $D_{forget}$ as:\n$\\Phi(g^{(k)}, D_{forget}) = \\frac{||g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F) + \\xi) \u2013 g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F))||^2}{||g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)} (x_F))||^2}$ (9)\nwhere $\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F)$ is the mean of $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ over $x_F \\in D_{forget}$. During unlearning, RMU steers $h^{(l)}(x_F)$ for all $x_F \\in D_{forget}$ to the fixed vector $cu + \\epsilon$ i.e. $||g^{(k)}(cu + \\epsilon) \u2013 g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F))||^2$ is minimized. If we let $\\xi = cu + \\epsilon \u2013 \\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F)$, we can define the unlearning problem as minimizing the noise sensitivity of layer. This objective is described by\n$\\min \\frac{||g^{(k)} (cu + \\epsilon) \u2013 g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F))||^2}{||g^{(k)} (\\hat{h}^{(l)} (x_F))||^2}$ (10)\nWhile $g^{(k)}$ is a composition of transformer layers, which is hard to expand it in term of $c$. Therefore, we propose to use the Jacobian matrix $J^{(k)}(x_F)$\u2014a linearized of $g^{(k)}$ at $x_F$\u2014which describes the change in the output of $g^{(k)}$ due to a noise perturbed in the input $\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F)$. For simplification, we write $\\hat{h}^{(l)}$, $J^{(k)}$ instead of $\\hat{h}^{(l)}(x_F)$, $J^{(k)}(x_F)$ respectively. The objective becomes\n$\\min \\frac{||J^{(k)} (cu + \\epsilon) \u2013 J^{(k)}\\hat{h}^{(l)} ||^2}{||J^{(k)}\\hat{h}^{(l)} ||^2}$ (11)\nSince $J^{(k)}$ is a linear transformation, then\n$||J^{(k)} (cu + \\epsilon) \u2013 J^{(k)}\\hat{h}^{(l)}||^2 = ||J^{(k)} (cu + \\epsilon \u2013 \\hat{h}^{(l)})||^2$ (12)\nLet $v = \\epsilon \u2013 \\hat{h}^{(l)}$. By definition of the squared norm, we have:\n$||J^{(k)} (cu + v)||^2 = (J^{(k)} (cu + v))^T J^{(k)} (cu + v)$ $(13)$\nLet matrix $A = J^{(k)T}J^{(k)}$. Expand the right-hand side of Eqn. 13, we get:\n$||J^{(k)} (cu + v)||^2$ $(14)$\nSince A is a symmetric matrix (i.e. $A^T = A$), then"}, {"title": "3.3 Robustness of RMU models to adversarial jailbreak attacks", "content": "RMU algorithms not only erase undesirable knowledge (forgotten knowledge) but also prevent them from resurfacing when attacked by adversarial jailbreak attacks.

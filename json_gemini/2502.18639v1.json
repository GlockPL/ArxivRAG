Traditional computational meth-\nods often struggle to process and analyze data efficiently [10], leading to delays\nin diagnosis and treatment. Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine\nlearning (QML) represent transformative advancements with the potential to\nrevolutionize precision medicine [3].

This paper explores the opportunities and challenges\nassociated with leveraging QC and QML to advance precision medicine, aim-\ning to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and future\ndirections.\n\nThe healthcare industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from a one-size-fits-all\napproach to a more tailored and individualized model of care [8,7]. P5 medicine\n(predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory and psycho-cognitive medicine)\n[19] is at the forefront of this transformation, aiming to provide treatments that\nare specifically designed for individual patients based on their unique genetic, en-\nvironmental, and lifestyle factors [36]. Traditional medical practices often rely on\ngeneralized treatment protocols that do not account for the significant variability\namong patients. This approach can lead to suboptimal outcomes, as treatments\nthat are effective for one group of patients may be ineffective or even harmful\nfor others [34]. This lack of personalization in treatment plans can result in pro-\nlonged illness, increased healthcare costs, and a higher incidence of adverse drug\nreactions. This is, in large part, because genetic variability plays a crucial role\nin how individuals respond to medications and treatments [24]. For example,\ncertain genetic mutations can affect drug metabolism, leading to variations in\ndrug efficacy and safety. P5 medicine can leverage genetic information to identify\nthese variations and tailor treatments accordingly. By understanding a patient's\ngenetic makeup, healthcare providers can predict which treatments will be most\neffective and avoid those that may cause harm. Because of the aging and growing\npopulations, diseases and health care costs rise, making disease prevention even\nmore important. Many complex diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases,\nand neurological disorders, have multifactorial causes that involve intricate inter-\nactions between genes, environment, and lifestyle. Traditional approaches often\nfall short in addressing these complexities. P5 medicine, through advanced tech-\nnologies such as genomic sequencing and bioinformatics, can unravel these in-\nteractions and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of diseases. This\nknowledge enables the development of targeted therapies that address the root\ncauses of diseases rather than just alleviating symptoms. Personalized medicine"}, {"title": "", "content": "also has the potential to advance preventive care. By identifying individuals at\nhigh risk for certain diseases based on their genetic and environmental profiles,\nhealthcare providers can implement early interventions to prevent the onset of\ndiseases. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the burden of chronic\ndiseases and improve overall population health.\n\nThe ultimate goal of P5 medicine is to improve patient outcomes. By tai-\nloring treatments to the individual characteristics of each patient, healthcare\nproviders can achieve higher treatment success rates, reduce the incidence of\nadverse effects, and enhance the overall quality of care. Personalized medicine\nempowers patients by involving them in their own care decisions and providing\nthem with treatments that are specifically designed for their needs. Apart from\nethical, legal and social issues, as well as regulatory and policy challenges, data\nintegration and management as well as associated costs are a crucial barrier\nfor the large-scale implementation of P5 medicine. The vast amount of data,\nsuch as genomic and phenotypic data, chemical/pharmaceutical data and data\nfrom electronic health records (EHR), require advanced computational tools for\nevaluation which are often associated with high hardware costs."}, {"title": "1.1 Limitations of a Classical Approach to Solving Complex\nProblems", "content": "The limitations of using classical techniques to solve complex problems are not\njust confined to the limitations of classical computing hardware.

Transistors cannot reduce in size\nbeyond a few atoms. Microchip technology has already progressed to the point\nwhere this size limitation may already have been reached and Moore's Law may\nhave already plateaued. Moore's Law is tied to Dennard Scaling, which states\nthat as the dimensions of a device go down, so does power consumption. How-\never, this again has physical limits. With smaller and smaller devices, the chances\nof current leakage across the device becomes ever more likely and increases the\nchance of thermal runaway (and hence the destruction) of the device through\noverheating. In addition, classical computer architecture still largely adheres to\nthe Von Neumann Architecture, where the microprocessor and memory are con-\nnected via a narrow bus, creating what is known as the Von Neumann Bottleneck:\nAs demand for faster computing power to solve ever more complex problems in-\ncreases, the demand on this bus to exchange data between the microprocessor\nand its memory exceeds its capability.\n\nThe rising demand for faster computing power to solve increasingly complex\nproblems in a reasonable time frame is pushing the capabilities of classical com-\nputing hardware to its physical limits."}, {"title": "1.1.2 Limitations of Classical Algorithms", "content": "Many problems that require a\nmathematical solution have a defined rate of increase in time needed to solve\nthat problem as that problem's complexity increases. For example, factoring a\nnumber is a problem who's complexity, and hence the time needed to solve the\nproblem, increases as the number to be factored gets larger and larger. This issue\nis known as Time Complexity. The rate of increase in the time to solve a problem\nas its complexity increases is usually categorised as either requiring polynomial\nor super-polynomial time. Super-polynomial time increases in accordance with;\n$f(x) = e^x$\nwhile polynomial time increases in accordance with;\n$f(x) = x^2$\nFig. 1 below shows how much more aggressively the time taken to solve more\ncomplex problems increases in superpolynomial time as opposed to polynomial.\nWith classical algorithms, we may alleviate this time penalty through the use\nof increased classical compute resources (e.g. faster processors, more memory\netc.). Such an approach could, for example, change the time scale for solving a\nproblem from seconds to milliseconds. But, as stated above, we are reaching the\nlimit of classical computing hardware capability and yet we continue to demand\nsolutions to ever more complex problems.\n\n\nFor some problems, we need to develop new algorithms in order to solve very\ncomplex examples of them in a reasonable time frame and overcome the issues\nof time complexity."}, {"title": "1.1.3 Grover's Algorithm - An Example of Shifting Time Complex-\nity From Superpolynomial to Polynomial Time", "content": "As we have seen, solving very complex problems requires a solution to the time\ncomplexity issue. Due to us hitting the limits of Moore's law and the like, mask-\ning this issue by investing more money in faster and more performant classical\nhardware is now a law of diminishing returns. Quantum algorithms, however,\ncan in some instances shift a problem's time complexity from superpolynomial\nto polynomial time. To illustrate this, we will briefly look at Grover's Algorithm.\nThis is a quantum algorithm that can reduce the time complexity of searching\nthrough data.\n\nConsider the problem where we have N number of data items (n), and we need\nto find one specific item in this set (we'll call it W). Using classical techniques,\nwe would need to examine each item n to test whether it is W. We use t to\ndenote the time it takes to test a data item n to ascertain whether it equals W\nor not. The total time T is the time it takes us to find W in a list of data items\nn in a set of size N. Thus, our best case scenario is given by:\n$T(W) = t$\nwhere we are lucky enough that the first data item we test happens to be W.\nHowever, our worst-case scenario is:\n$T(W) = tN$\nwhere the item we are searching for is the last item in set N. The average time\nit will take us to find Wis:\n$T(W) = tN/2$\nUsing this classical search technique, we cannot improve on this. However, Grover's\nalgorithm exploits the quantum phenomena of superposition to optimise our\nsearch (see Fig. 2).\n\nRemark 1. Superposition describes the quantum state where a property of a\nquantum particle (e.g. an electron or photon) is not in one specific state, but\nrather exists in a state of probabilities that the property is one value or another.\nIn QC, such quantum particles that we can manipulate in this way are referred\nto as qubits.\n\nLet's suppose we are searching for a specific number between 0 and 3. We will\ndenote these four values in binary, i.e. 00, 01, 10 and 11. That gives a set of\npossible choices of N=4. Furthermore, let us suppose that we are searching for\nthe number 2 (10 in binary). We can use four quantum particles (i.e. qubits) to\neach represent the four numbers we need to search through. At a very high level,\nand avoiding all the advanced mathematics and quantum theory behind it, the\nprocess is as follows:\n\n1. We put each qubit in a state of superposition, whereby the probability of\nthat qubit being any of our 4 numbers is equal"}, {"title": "", "content": "2. We then apply a function that inverts our required answer (in this case 2 or\n10)\n3. We then invert the probabilities about the mean value. The three incorrect\nanswers cancel themselves out, and we are left with our desired result\n\n\n\nIn essence, Grover's algorithm allows us to search all of our items n in the set\nwith N items at once, rather than examining each individually. This now gives\nus an average search time of\n$T(W) = t \\sqrt{N}$\nas opposed to\n$T(W) = tN/2$\nSo, if we had 100 items to search in order to find W, using classical techniques\nwe would take on average the time it takes to search 50 items to find it. Using\nGrover's algorithm, it only takes the time to search 10.\n\nQuantum algorithms therefore provide us with the advanced tools we need to\nanalyse and evaluate vast quantities of data, as well as solve highly complex\nproblems in reasonable time frames. However, we cannot solve the equations\nassociated with quantum algorithms using classical hardware. Classical hard-\nware does not have access to fundamental particles and their quantum states.\nWe therefore need quantum computers in order to execute these algorithms and\nachieve the quantum advantage we require to effectively deliver the improved\nhealth outcomes promised by P5 medicine."}, {"title": "1.2 Quantum Computers", "content": "A Quantum Computer is a device capable of performing quantum calculations.\nSuch calculations include Grover's Algorithm discussed earlier.

This study contributes to the discourse by examining the interplay of technological, economic, and demographic factors on environmental sustainability. This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) innovation, economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI), energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in the United States from 1990 to 2022. Employing the ARDL framework integrated with the STIRPAT model, the findings reveal a dual narrative: while AI innovation mitigates environmental stress, economic growth, energy use, FDI, and urbanization exacerbate environmental degradation. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, and DF-GLS) confirm mixed integration levels among variables, and the ARDL bounds test establishes long-term co-integration. The analysis highlights that Al innovation positively correlates with CO2 reduction when environmental safeguards are in place, whereas GDP growth, energy consumption, FDI, and urbanization intensify CO2 emissions. Robustness checks using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR validate the ARDL findings. Additionally, Pairwise Granger causality tests reveal significant one-way causal links between CO2 emissions and economic growth, AI innovation, energy use, FDI, and urbanization. These relationships emphasize the critical role of Al-driven technological advancements, sustainable investments, and green energy in fostering ecological sustainability. The study suggests policy measures such as encouraging green FDI, advancing AI technologies, adopting sustainable energy practices, and implementing eco-friendly urban development to promote sustainable growth in the USA.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The environment is crucial for supporting life on Earth; nevertheless, the increasing global pollution and waste have emerged as a significant problem in recent years [1,2]. The majority of climate-altering and planet-warming substances emitted into the atmosphere are carbon dioxide (CO2) [3]. The United States (USA) distinguishes itself among these nations through its evolution as a dominant force in consumption as well as production [4]. In 2020, the USA emitted 5,416 metric tons (MT) of CO2, or almost 16% of global emissions [5]. However, in 2021, the United States reinforced its dedication to the Paris Agreement, adopting an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution to reach a 50\u201352% drop in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 [6,7]. The United States consumes the largest quantity of fossil fuel annually, totaling 913.3 million tons of oil, which is 50% greater than China's consumption, the second highest globally [8,9]. Alleviating the adverse effects of global climate change has emerged as a worldwide priority, with a crucial component of this effort being the reduction of CO2 emissions [10,11]. In accordance with the UN 2030 universal sustainable development objective, the advancement of renewable energy is prioritized above everything else. Consequently, the USA has considerable accountability for the climate crisis and global warming, being one of the foremost emitters of GHGs; thus, assessing its environmental sustainability is a critical issue. In this context, our research question is"}, {"title": "", "content": "to examine the response of GDP, FDI, energy consumption, urbanization, and Al innovation on CO2 emissions in the context of United States.\nSeveral scholars have thoroughly investigated the ecological conditions in the United States, mostly utilizing pollution metrics such as CO2 emissions [12,13]. By encouraging domestic investment, facilitating technological transfers in the receiving nation, and boosting the development of human capital, foreign direct investment (FDI) enhances economic growth and is therefore essential to economic development [14]. Another viewpoint holds that FDI improves host countries' surroundings by bringing cutting-edge environmental technologies and sustainable practices [15,16]. The environment field is not an exception to the dramatic transformations we have lately experienced in numerous industries as artificial intelligence (AI) has grown more integrated. The United States leads in AI development and will be essential in developing suitable guardrails and regulatory frameworks that promote the responsible use of the technology [17]. The development of AI technologies can help address several global green growth concerns. Furthermore, applying AI can reduce environmental emissions [18]. Businesses are facing pressure to curtail GHG emissions and promote environmentally friendly practices as the global community battles climate change.\nIn 2020, the United States was the second-largest contributor to world pollution, producing 4.7 billion metric tons of CO2. Multiple studies has demonstrated the mixed consequences of GDP on CO2 emission in different regions [19,20,21]. After acknowledging this fact, politicians and governments must create plans for resource sustainability and seek solutions that strike a balance between ecological sustainability and GDP [22]. Increased use of clean energy sources is thought to be able to lessen the negative economic effects of climate change [23,24]. Between 2005 and 2022, emissions from the energy sector decreased by 35.9%, during which the sector represented almost one quarter of total US emissions. Furthermore, the United States' share of GDP in 2015 that went toward renewable energy was 0.2%, far less than that of other developing nations like South Africa (1.4%), China (0.9%), India (0.5%), and Brazil (0.4%) [25]. With a 15.8% share of primary energy consumption and 13.8% share of CO2 emissions in 2020, the United States is also the world's top primary energy consumer [26].\nThis study enhances existing research in the following manners: Firstly this paper critically analyzes the correlation among Al innovation, foreign direct investment, and CO2 emissions in the United States. Secondly, unlike previous studies that solely examined developing nations, this research focuses on one of the world's most industrialized countries with a robust financial system, with the aim of investigating and clarifying the relationship between financial systems and environmental sustainability. Moreover, it is the inaugural investigation of the dynamic interconnections among AI innovation, energy consumption, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Specifically the United States provides an ideal context for investigating the correlation between economic activity and environmental sustainability, given its significant ecological deficit and developed economy. This study reveals that while AI innovation reduces CO2 emissions, factors such as GDP, FDI, urbanization, and energy consumption exacerbate environmental degradation. This unique contribution is vital for stakeholders as it offers tangible insights into how industrialized countries, like the USA, may harmonize economic growth with environmental sustainability. Additionally, the research corroborates the STIRPAT framework along with sophisticated methods like ARDL in the United States, employing a contemporary dataset from 1990 to 2022. Furthermore, it employs a comprehensive approach and innovative econometric models to offer significant insights that aid the United States in its endeavors to attain SDG-7 and SDG-13, especially in the quest for carbon neutrality. This research offers governments, corporations, and environmental advocates scientifically substantiated ideas for reconciling economic and environmental objectives, chiefly via financial, technological, and industrial modifications.\nThe subsequent portions of this work are organized as follows: Section II examines the pertinent literature, Section III delineates the methodology and data, Section IV showcases the results and analysis, and Section V explores the policy implications and conclusions."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "It is clear from a thorough analysis of earlier research that not many studies have looked into the connection between GDP, energy use, FDI, CO2 emissions, and AI innovation. The bulk of publications concentrated on the effects of trade openness, urbanization, and green energy usage on environmental quality, even though several investigations looked at the ARDL model. The USA hasn't seen much in-depth research on ecological degradation, a relatively young discipline. Nevertheless, the research drew upon a few previous studies to guide the selection of variables and methods. This section will address a select few of these questions."}, {"title": "GDP and CO2 emission", "content": "Numerous researches have been conducted to ascertain the correlation between environmental and economic activity. For example, Manu and Sulaiman [27] examined the impact of energy consumption and economic growth on Malaysia's CO2 emissions utilizing the OLS method for the years 1965 to 2015. Their research demonstrated that CO2 emissions diminish as revenue escalates. The favorable relationship between economic expansion and CO2 emission is found by Saudi et al.[28], and Zubair et al.[29]. Conversely, Sarkar et al. [30] analyzed time-series data from 1980 to 2016 to investigate the relationship among Malaysia's energy use, CO2 emissions, and economic expansion. The empirical evidence indicated that usage of energy and economic expansion substantially elevated CO2 emissions in Malaysia from 1980 to 2016. In order to examine the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions, Chen et al. [31] used China's annual data from 1990 to 2020 and the QARDL technique. They discovered that China's GDP has a positive effect on CO2 emissions. Etokakpan et al. [32] analyzed the relationship between capital formation, globalization, CO2 emissions, and GDP in Malaysia using a dataset from 1980 to 2014 within a multivariate framework. The authors employed an innovative combined co-integration test to ascertain the magnitude of the long-run equilibrium relationship. The empirical findings indicated that GDP adversely affected environmental quality. Multiple researcher such as Wada et al.[33] within Brazil, Rjoub et al. [34] in Turkey and He at al.[35] within Mexico found the same conclusions. On the other hand, Muhammad et al.

[40] analyzes industrial robot data from 16 sectors in China from 2006 to 2016 to investigate the correlation between Al and energy intensity. The implementation of AI technology in the industrial sector diminishes energy intensity by enhancing industrial output while decreasing energy consumption and environmental degradation. Chen et al. [41] investigate the impact of Al on carbon emissions utilizing panel data from 270 Chinese cities spanning 2011 to 2017. Their empirical findings indicate that AI decreases carbon emissions by optimizing production processes, boosting communication facilities, and advancing green technological innovation. Negi [42] examines the investment trends in artificial intelligence originating from the three leading nations: China, India, and the United States. The paper delineates the measures the government has implemented to integrate artificial intelligence into its existing ecosystem.

They employed the ARDL and DOLS methodologies, which revealed a positive and significant energy use coefficient in relation to CO2 emissions, indicating a 0.91% rise in CO2 emissions for every 1% increase in energy usage. Adebayo and Kalmaz [47] employed ARDL, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators to reveal a substantial positive correlation between power consumption and CO2 emissions in Egypt, utilizing data from 1971 to 2014. Moreover, Adebayo et al. [48] identified a positive correlation between CO2 emissions and energy consumption by employing the ARDL model for MINT nations, covering the period from 1980 to 2018. Conversely, Raihan and Tuspekova [49] examined the correlation between green energy utilization and CO2 emissions in Peru from 1990 to 2018. Using the DOLS and ARDL methodologies, they found a negative correlation and statistical significance in the utilization of clean energy, suggesting that a 1% increase in green power use results in a 0.52% reduction in CO2 emissions over the long term. Multiple researcher such as Abbasi and Adedoyin [50] in China, Balsalobre-Lorente et al.[51] across BRICS countries, Saqib [52] in MENA region corroborated the destructive effect of energy usage on environment quality. On the other hand, Younis et al. [53], Salari et al. [54] concluded that energy consumption boost the environment quality.

Jafri et al. [57] investigate the asymmetric impact of FDI on CO2 emissions utilizing the NARDL methodology for China from 1981 to 2019. Their findings indicate that a positive shift in FDI has a comparatively greater impact on CO2 emissions. Moreover, several studies also found the same conclusion in different region [58,59,60,61]. On the other hand, Lin et al. [62] examine the impact of FDI on emission reduction in China from 2004 to 2015, employing geographic Durbin economic models with two-way fixed effects. The findings indicate that FDI facilitates a decrease in emissions nationwide. Furthermore, Eskeland and Harrison [63] contended that FDI typically accompanies energy-efficient technologies and may positively impact the natural world. Similar outcomes were also observed by Wang et al. [64] in China, Pata and Samour [65] within France, and Abbas et al.[66] in developing countries.

For instance, Mahmood et al. [69] examine the impact of urbanization on per capita CO2 emissions in Saudi Arabia, analyzing data from the years 1968 to 2014. The findings indicate that urbanization hinders the environment due to its elastic impact on emissions. Parshall et al.

[71] explore the impact of urbanization on the load capacity factor in Mexico from 1971 to 2018. This study utilizes the ARDL approach and demonstrates that urbanization decreases Mexico's LCF, thereby degrading the ecology. Sufyanullah et al. [72] examined the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in Pakistan. They employed the ARDL model and noted that CO2 emissions rise with increased urbanization. Additional studies [73,74,75,76,77] suggest that urbanization increases CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. In comparison, Xu et al. [78] evaluated the impact of urbanization on the ecosystem in Brazil from 1970 to 2017.

This study tries to fill in that gap by looking at modern variables using advanced methods from a U.S. point of view. The goal is to find the main and secondary effects of GDP, Al innovation, energy consumption, urbanization, and FDI on CO2 emissions in this area.

By using STIRPAT, this study allows for an extensive evaluation of numerous variables that affect CO2 emissions in the context of USA. The IPAT model was proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren [83] and is phrased as follows:\n$I = SPAT$   (1)\nNonetheless, this model proved challenging to evaluate hypothetically [84]. To address these constraints, Dietz and Rosa [85] expanded the IPAT model, resulting in the STIRPAT model. This research can effectively assess the interplay between human activities and environmental outcomes by representing CO2 emissions as the 'I' or impact variable, urbanization as the 'P', and other variables like Al innovation, GDP, energy consumption, as the 'T' or technological variables.

One possible reason is that FDI frequently results in elevated industrial activity, increased energy consumption, and intensified resource exploitation; hence, it amplifies environmental deterioration. Nie et al. [124", "125": "corroborate this result. Conversely, Azam and Raza [126", "127": "Pazienza [128", "129": "revealed that FDI can mitigate CO2 emissions and improve biodiversity quality. Additionally, the positive and statistically significant URBA coefficients indicate that both long-term and short-term increases in LURBA negatively affect environmental quality. A 1% increase in URBA raises LCO2 by 0.710% in the long run and by 0.641% in the short run. These findings suggest that the current urbanization structure in the United States is not conducive to reducing pollution. Several researchers have also observed a similar outcome, including Yuan et al. [130", "131": "in Pakistan, Anwar et al. [132", "al.[133": "in developing economies, and Raihan et al.

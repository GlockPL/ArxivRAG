Unfortunately, demographic segregation remains rampant in US public schools, despite over 70 years since the passing of federal legislation formally outlawing segregation by race. However, changing how students are assigned to schools can help foster more integrated learning environments. In this paper, we explore \"school mergers\u201d as one such under-explored, yet promising, student assignment policy change. School mergers involve merging the school attendance boundaries, or catchment areas, of schools and subsequently changing the grades each school offers. We develop an algorithm to simulate elementary school mergers across 200 large school districts serving 4.5 million elementary school students and find that pairing or tripling schools in this way could reduce racial/ethnic segregation by a median relative 20% and as much as nearly 60% in some districts while increasing driving times to schools by an average of a few minutes each way. Districts with many interfaces between racially/ethnically-disparate neighborhoods tend to be prime candidates for mergers. We also compare the expected results of school mergers to other typical integration policies, like redistricting, and find that different policies may be more or less suitable in different places.

Some may argue that focusing on diversity diverts attention from addressing academic disparities. However, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and residential patterns contribute to educational segregation and widen achievement gaps (Fiel & Zhang, 2018; Reardon, Kalogrides, & Shores, 2019). Furthermore, the benefits of diversity extend far beyond academic achievement. Diverse educational settings can equip children with the skills needed to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world (Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, 2001). These settings create opportunities for engagement across different social groups, addressing stereotypical perceptions while fostering cognitive empathy and a genuine respect for diversity (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright, 2011; Salanga & Bernardo, 2019).\nUnfortunately, demographic segregation remains rampant in US public schools (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2022), especially in elementary schools, which are smaller, greater in number, and draw from smaller catchment areas, increasing the link between residential and school segregation (Fiel & Zhang, 2018).\nHistorically, school systems have explored a myriad of desegregation strategies, from the strategic placement of popular magnet programs, to \u201credistricting\u201d, or the redrawing of the school catchment areas that determine which students attend which schools (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023). While geographic proximity (convenience) and residential segregation often dictate school enrollment, magnet & choice schools aim to attract students from different demographics by offering specialized programs or curricula (e.g. STEM, arts, language immersion) (Ayscue & Siegel-Hawley, 2019; Hawkins, 2018). While potentially effective in boosting diversity, there are challenges to maintaining diverse enrollments. Additionally, ensuring equitable access can limit the impact on reducing segregation, with affluent families often being in a better position to benefit from these programs (Villarreal, 2010).\nA powerful \"default setting\" that influences how the majority of students across the US are assigned to public schools is school attendance boundaries. Attendance boundaries are the catchment areas that school districts draw to determine which neighborhoods are assigned to which schools. Prior work has demonstrated how \u201credistricting\u201d, or redrawing school district boundaries, might foster more diverse and integrated schools while, surprisingly, possibly also slightly reducing travel times (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023). The study developed redistricting algorithms to simulate changes across nearly 100 US public school districts, building upon other literature in algorithmic redistricting\u2014most notably, tools and methods developed to explore changes to voting districts in order to facilitate more equitable participation in the political process (Becker & Solomon, 2022; Gurnee & Shmoys, 2021).\nUnfortunately, school redistricting is often hotly contested and opposed by community members. Racial/ethnic integration is typically not a redistricting priority (Castro, Siegel-Hawley, Bridges, & Williams, 2022)\u2014and when it is, it can surface concerns about splitting students up from their friend groups and other issues of \"community cohesion\u201d (Bridges, 2016). Some of these concerns may be coded reflections of parents' racialized preferences for schooling (Billingham & Hunt, 2016; Hailey, 2021; Hall & Hibel, 2017); others may reflect concerns about diminished access to \"quality\" schools, reflecting a deeper-seated perception of access to quality education as a \u201czero-sum\u201d game (Siegel-Hawley, Diem, & Frankeberg, 2018). While some districts have experimented with voluntary integration plans (Holley-Walker, 2009), many of which incorporate both boundary and choice-based policies, their impacts have been limited due to challenges in implementation and oversight. This suggests the importance of district-initiated and supported student assignment policy changes to reduce demographic segregation. Prior work suggests that nearly two-thirds of segregation can be attributed to the lines that are drawn between school districts (Barshay, 2024; Fiel, 2013), which fall under the purview of state legislatures. However, within-district boundaries\u2014like school attendance boundaries, which districts themselves have jurisdiction over redrawing\u2014still contribute to segregation in a nontrivial way, and so, may serve as powerful and more practical levers for reducing demographic segregation across schools.\nThe important role school districts can play in integrating schools is further underscored by renewed efforts by the US Department of Education to support districts in exploring and implementing new integration strategies\u2014for example, through their 2023 \"Fostering Diverse Schools\u201d grant program (Jacobson, 2023). Such efforts stand to benefit from empirical research into different types of integration strategies that may help reduce segregation and foster more equitable learning environments across districts.\nIn this study, we investigate one particular integration strategy that districts might explore: \"school mergers\", illustrated in Figure 1. School mergers involve merging the attendance boundaries of pairs or triples of adjacent schools and subsequently modifying the grades they serve in order to promote demographically diverse classrooms. For example, consider two adjacent K-5 schools within a district (see Fig. 1a). Despite their vicinity,"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "We measure segregation using the dissimilarity index (Massey & Denton, 1988), where the two groups of students correspond to White students and students of color. A score of 1 indicates perfect segregation (all White students and students of color are concentrated entirely in separate schools), and a score of 0 indicates perfect integration (i.e., each school's racial/ethnic demographics reflect district-level proportions). While the dissimilarity index suffers from several shortcomings (James & Taeuber, 1985; Winship, 1978), prior work on algorithmic redistricting for school integration has revealed similar results when optimizing for dissimilarity and other measures of segregation, like the normalized exposure index (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023).\nOur algorithm seeks to identify pairings and triplings that might minimize this dissimilarity measure while respecting several constraints depicted in Figure 2 and described in more detail in the Materials and Methods section. One notable constraint is on school capacities: mergers cannot occur if any of the schools in the merger would subsequently exceed their capacity. Unfortunately, school capacities are not reported by the Department of Education; therefore, we use the maximum enrollment observed at the school over the past six years (from 2016/2017 to 2021/2022) as a proxy. This is an imperfect measure that does not account for schools that are chronically over or under-enrolled; therefore, an important caveat is that our simulations may, at times, suggest inviable mergers, or fail to propose viable ones, due to this estimation procedure.\nAfter identifying which schools should be merged and subsequently which grade levels each school should serve, the algorithm produces a number of outputs describing various expected family and district-level impacts of the new student assignment regime. These outputs\u2014like expected impacts on travel times, school demographics, and other"}, {"title": "Sensitivity analyses", "content": "We conduct four sensitivity analyses. The first explores how results might differ under an alternative objective measure of segregation\u2014Black/Hispanic vs. White/Asian segregation and how that compares to the White/students of color segregation we analyze throughout the paper. The second explores how impacts on integration might differ if some subset of families involved in a school merger opted out of their schools. The third investigates how results might differ under different minimum school capacity constraints. Finally, the fourth explores results in a setting where between district mergers are also allowed. Details are available in the Supplementary Materials."}, {"title": "Optimizing for Black/Hispanic and White/Asian integration", "content": "The application of school mergers as an integration strategy requires factoring in local context. Different districts have unique demographic distributions, geographies, or other characteristics that may be pertinent. While the main results minimize dissimilarity between White students and students of color, in some districts, a salient dimension of segregation may be segregation between Black and Hispanic students and their White and Asian counterparts\u2014though this, too, is a contentious dichotomy Orfield (1994). We therefore conduct additional simulations that seek to minimize Black/Hispanic and White/Asian dissimilarity across districts and find nearly identical results. In some districts, however\u2500particularly those with a large concentration of Asian students\u2014there are notable differences in the relative expected impacts of optimizing for either notion of dissimilarity. See the Supplementary Materials for more details."}, {"title": "Opt-out analysis", "content": "We follow the method described in (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023) to estimate how the prevalence of magnet and charter schools might impact the extent to which families remain in their new schools post-merger. In particular, for each school district in our sample, we identify which charter and magnet schools fall within the boundaries of that district and the ratio of enrollment, by race/ethnicity, in the \u201cchoice\u201d options relative to closed-enrollment district options (for example, if 100 White students attend the closed-enrollment elementary schools in the district, and 20 attend charter or magnet schools, this ratio would be 0.2). We then simplistically model a scenario where students attending a school that our algorithm pairs or triples with another school opt out at a rate indicated by their demographic-specific ratio. Doing this reveals a median expected decrease in dissimilarity of approximately 17%, down from the 20% in our main results. Of course, the impacts could be more severe if families opt for private options or move out of the district entirely. Nevertheless, these results suggest that pairings and triplings can still meaningfully advance desegregation efforts even if some families do not adhere to the new student assignment policies."}, {"title": "Changing the minimum school enrollment threshold", "content": "Our main results require that a school's enrollment post-merger must be at least 80% of its pre-merger enrollment. This is because school funding is often tied to enrollment numbers, and therefore, allowing drastic reductions in enrollment could lead to large funding cuts, as well as other unfavorable impacts like decreased parental involvement or extracurricular participation. We find that loosening the constraint on minimum school capacity yields more schools involved in mergers, and larger decreases in dissimilarity. In particular, setting the minimum required enrollment to 0% allows the possibility of schools that serve no students post-merger\u2014i.e., a \u201cschool closure\". School closures, while sometimes necessary due to declining student enrollments and other demographic forces, can create disruptive \u201cclosure effects\u201d such as reduced morale and drop in academic performance for the students they impact (Kirshner, Gaertner, & Pozzoboni, 2010). Nevertheless, some districts may find closures desirable, for saving costs on under-utilized or aging schools, or as an opportunity for renovation/demolition. School closures have become a particularly relevant topic post-COVID, as many districts are facing \u201cfiscal cliffs\" and accordingly, difficult resourcing decisions\u2014with the imminent end of pandemic-era funding (Roza & Dhammani, 2024).\nWe set the minimum enrollment requirement to 0% to allow for the possibility of closures and simulate school mergers. Results suggest pairing or tripling 7,116 across our 200 districts, but only closing 24 of them (i.e., 24 would no longer serve any students post-merger)-though 312 would serve 50% or less of their original enrollment post-merger. These results suggest that in some districts, school closures might advance desegregation objectives, but for the reasons above, policymakers should proceed with caution as they consider them. See Supplementary Materials for more details."}, {"title": "Allowing inter-district mergers", "content": "Our primary simulations explore within-district mergers, even though a majority of school segregation can be attributed to how the lines between districts themselves are drawn (Barshay, 2024; Fiel, 2013). In practice, between-district mergers, like other inter-district integration policies (Potter & Burris, 2020), may be difficult to enact because they require coordination between multiple local educational agencies. However, they may offer pathways to integration that are not possible solely within certain districts (Simko, 2023).\nWe conduct simulations that allow a district's schools to merge either with other adjacent schools in the same district, or with adjacent schools in a neighboring district. Simulating these inter-district pairings and triplings yields an expected decrease in dissimilarity of just over 12% and would require students involved in a merger to travel, on average, approximately 4.5 minutes longer to school each way. The longer travel times make sense given the larger geography that inter-district mergers would operate over. The relatively smaller decrease in segregation (compared to the main intra-district results presented above) also makes sense given that inter-district mergers are only possible between schools on the borders of the districts; in the event that schools further from the borders also contribute to between-district segregation, which is likely, only allowing mergers between border schools will limit how much integration between districts is possible."}, {"title": "Case studies", "content": "To make our primary results more concrete, we explore two specific districts as case studies: one demonstrating a comparatively smaller potential decrease in segregation due to mergers, and another, a larger potential decrease."}, {"title": "Miami-Dade", "content": "Miami-Dade is the largest district in our sample, with an elementary school population of 118,731 elementary students across 211 closed-enrollment schools. The majority of these students are classified as Hispanic/Latinx, with White students making up 7% of the population. The district has a dissimilarity index of 0.58-higher than the median of 0.41 across the full sample of districts\u2014suggesting more opportunity for mergers to foster less segregated schools.\nSimulating mergers proposes pairing 118 schools into 59 clusters and tripling 24 schools into 8 clusters, yielding a resulting dissimilarity index of 0.56, a relative decrease of just 3.7%. These pairings and triplings would involve 36.9% of elementary school students in the district (approximately 43,773), and hence, require them at some point to switch elementary schools. For these students, we estimate that their average travel time to school (each way) would increase from 4 minutes to 7 minutes. Despite the potential for integration, mergers appear to offer limited gains in integration for this district.\nThese results may be due to an interesting mix of social and geographical factors. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the schools along the coast comprise relatively more White students than inland districts. Since these coastal schools are surrounded by water on at least one side but as many as all sides, there is minimal interface between clusters of White students and clusters of students of color in the district. Ultimately, since the underlying mechanism of school mergers involves pairing or tripling adjacent schools, Miami-Dade serves as an example of a school district with lower potential for integration using this strategy.\nDistricts like Miami-Dade may wish to explore non-adjacent mergers, though, given the greater impact such mergers are likely to have on driving times, and the fact that families often prefer contiguous attendance areas Montgomery County Public Schools Districtwide Boundary Analysis (2021), these policies may prove more difficult to pass in practice. Multi-group measures of segregation like Elbers (2021) may also help highlight dimensions of segregation that may be masked by a dichotomous measure like the dissimilarity index."}, {"title": "Plano Independent School District (ISD)", "content": "Plano Independent School District has approximately 17,553 students across 43 closed-enrollment elementary schools, with the majority classified as White or Hispanic/Latinx students and White students making up 34% of the population. The existing dissimilarity index for Plano ISD is 0.32, below the median value of 0.41.\nSimulating school mergers yields a pairing of 36 elementary schools into 18 clusters and tripling 3 schools into a single cluster. These changes would yield a dissimilarity index of 0.15, a relative decrease of 54%. Remarkably, pairing/tripling schools could halve existing levels of racial/ethnic segregation across the district's elementary schools. In this simulation, nearly half of the elementary-aged students (48.0%, approximately 8,430) would be required to switch schools at some point. For these students, we estimate that their average driving times would increase by approximately 3 minutes each way (from 4 to 7 minutes). In contrast to Miami-Dade, Plano ISD has a greater number of interfaces between areas of majority color and majority White areas, akin to a checkerboard pattern (Fig. 6b). This reflects the propensity for even diverse cities to reflect segregation at smaller scales, as communities often self-select into homogenous neighborhoods and communities (Nilforoshan et al., 2023). Since school mergers rely upon a mechanism of pairing adjacent schools to adjust student demographics, the presence of diverse populations in adjacent attendance boundaries makes this strategy potentially highly effective in this district."}, {"title": "Spatial autocorrelation as a heuristic", "content": "The two case studies (\u00a7) suggest that the degree to which school pairings and triplings might reduce dissimilarity may be associated with the extent to which a district exhibits demographic spatial clustering.\nGeary's C is a statistical measure of spatial autocorrelation (i.e. clustering). In particular, when C is large, it suggests that geographic units within a district (i.e., attendance boundaries) with different proportions of students from the same demographic groups tend to be adjacent. Accordingly, a low value of C signifies high racial segregation across attendance boundaries and limited geographic interfaces between diverse populations throughout the district. For instance, Geary's C for Miami-Dade (Fig. 6a) is 0.428, whereas for Plano ISD (Fig. 6b), it is 0.781.\nWe compute C for all districts in our sample and compare it to the expected decrease in segregation observed for those districts after simulating school mergers, illustrated in Figure 6c. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient of p = -0.592 suggests a strong negative association between both measures\u2014i.e., districts with strong patterns of demographic spatial autocorrelation also tend to be those where pairings/triplings yield the largest decreases in dissimilarity. However, the correlation is far from perfect, and outliers like Birmingham City-where C = 1.1 but \u2206D = \u22120.067\u2014illustrate the important role other locale-specific factors (like school capacities) might play in enabling large gains in integration from school mergers. Still, Geary's C can serve as a useful visual heuristic that districts may use to quickly assess the potential for integration across different student or school characteristics."}, {"title": "Comparison to redistricting", "content": "School mergers are just one of many integration strategies that districts might pursue. Different strategies are likely to work with varying degrees of effectiveness in different places, depending on each place's unique demographics, geographies, and other characteristics. To help school districts better understand which integration strategies might be more or less effective in their districts, we compare our school merger simulation results to those from another integration strategy: the redrawing of school attendance boundaries, or \"redistricting\" (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023). Specifically, for each district in our sample, we explore how the potential gains in integration vs. costs in travel times that school mergers might induce compare to the gains in integration vs. costs in number of students who would be required to switch schools under a given redistricting plan. For redistricting, we focus on school switching instead of travel times as the primary \u201ccost\u201d of integration given results from (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023), which showed that in many cases, travel times might actually decrease under integration-promoting redistricting plans.\nFigure 7 illustrates the trade-offs of each strategy in the form of a scatter plot with four quadrants, for the top 197 school districts by population size (redistricting results are drawn from (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023) and (Gillani, Beeferman, Overney, Vega-Pourheydarian, & Roy, 2023); three districts in our sample of 200 did not have corresponding redistricting results, likely due to performance bottlenecks that prevented their successful simulation). The figure shows a moderate correlation (p = 0.46, p < 0.0001) between both integration strategies, suggesting that, in general, districts where mergers offer a high-yield, low-cost approach to integration also tend to be districts where redistricting offers the same (and vice versa). Crucially, Figure 7 also reveals that there are different types of districts\u2014some where both mergers and redistricting may yield large integration gains at comparatively lower costs; some where neither strategy produces large gains in integration relative to costs; and some where one policy appears to yield greater gains relative to costs compared to others. A thorough exploration of these results\u2014including the specific characteristics of districts that make them more or less suited for either strategy is beyond the scope of this paper. We include this data in our data release so interested readers may explore these differences further. Importantly, these results highlight how the simulation of different integration strategies might help districts determine which ones offer more or less promise in their districts, and therefore, could serve as a useful resource for local policy-makers."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our findings highlight that, across many districts, school mergers can serve as an effective school integration strategy without imposing large driving time increases for families. Interestingly, several districts exhibit a potential for \u201cintegration arbitrage\", or large decreases in segregation that may be achieved through comparatively small driving time increases. One factor associated with the extent to which mergers might foster more integration in a school district is the strength of spatial autocorrelation in the district's demographics: districts with more interfaces between racially/ethnically diverse elementary attendance boundaries are more likely to benefit from pairings and triplings as an integration strategy. Finally, when comparing school mergers to another common integration strategy-redistricting\u2014we find that in some districts, either strategy may yield promising reductions in segregation without imposing large travel time or student-school-switching costs; in others, neither strategy appears to be particularly effective; and still in others, one strategy may be more effective than the other. Importantly, the findings we present for the 200 districts in our sample of study may not generalize to other districts around the US. To enable researchers, practitioners, and community members to explore how mergers might unfold and what impacts they could have in a broader sample of districts, we release an interactive public dashboard (https://mergers.schooldiversity.org).\nWe note several limitations in our preliminary study, which we believe can inspire future work on this nascent but important topic. For one, we found little literature on the longer-term academic, socioemotional, and other impacts of school pairings and triplings. While a long line of studies like (Johnson, 2011) highlight the positive impacts of desegregation efforts more generally, an open question remains around whether and how requiring additional school transitions at the elementary ages might impact these outcomes. Prior literature has highlighted the potentially disruptive effects of elementary-to-middle school transitions (Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: Start Times, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments, 2011). However, these transitions are often accompanied by changes to friendship networks, including split friendship groups in cases where an elementary school might split-feed into more than one middle school. School pairings and triplings keep within-grade friend cohorts together, perhaps mitigating these disruptive effects though additional research is required to fully understand their impacts.\nAnother class of limitations includes the potential inconveniences that mergers might impose on families. As described in the results section, mergers may reduce walkability to schools- -an issue that may be mitigated by imposing travel or distance constraints in the mergers algorithm to only allow mergers that are likely to preserve walkability (or other commute-related desiderata). Mergers may also split siblings of similar ages up into different schools-posing logistical or other challenges to parents looking to participate in their children's school communities (though this may happen at later ages anyways, e.g., when the older child(ren) transition from elementary to middle school). Fortunately, there are examples of case studies like (Sundaram, 2024) highlighting how mergers, when conducted with thoughtful foresight and planning, can have positive impacts on students and families. Learning from such case studies before implementing mergers in other places might help mitigate such inconveniences.\nOur use of the dissimilarity index to measure segregation between White students and students of color in school districts poses another limitation. We recognize that this dichotomous measure risks essentializing racial differences as well as disregarding the diversity within the broader \u2018students of color' category. However, given the persistent disparities in educational access & outcomes along these lines, and associations between race/ethnicity and other measures of segregation that often accompany achievement gaps (like socioeconomic status-based segregation (Reardon et al., 2019)), it remains a salient lens for identifying patterns of segregation and informing efforts to create more integrated & equitable schools. Fortunately, it is relatively straightforward to simulate school mergers across other student groups and definitions of diversity. Future work may consider less traditional, yet still important, definitions of diversity\u2014like diversity in place of origin, neurodivergence, disability status, school curriculum/program offerings, and even typical academic performance measures. We release the data and code from this paper to support other researchers in these explorations.\nThere are also several simplifications and assumptions we make in order to produce preliminary results. Perhaps most notably, we are limited in the extent to which we can anticipate how families might respond to mergers by opting out of assigned schools. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that even under increased opt-out rates, mergers are still likely to meaningfully contribute to district-level integration objectives. Still, prior case studies like (Arriaza, 2019; Swanson, 1965) suggest that parents sometimes have strong reactions to the possibility of school pairings and triplings. This means that school opt-outs are likely to continue to threaten progress towards integration\u2014though, perhaps, not entirely undo it. Indeed, a recent pairing in Charlotte did not witness disproportionate levels of flight post-pairing (Helms, 2020). Reducing flight and therefore securing the integrative impacts of student assignment policy changes will likely require a thoughtful approach to community engagement, among other efforts (Gillani, Overney, Schuch, & Chandra, 2023).\nFinally, additional practical considerations include 1) how districts might account for increased transportation costs that mergers might introduce, and 2) whether or not the physical infrastructure of elementary schools may be flexible enough to accommodate/focus on different grade cohorts. Working closely with school districts to obtain new datasets on school facilities, and exploring algorithms that try to jointly optimize travel (e.g., bus routing) alongside integration or even algorithms that select from a menu of different integration strategies (e.g., redistricting or pairings/triplings) for a particular district-may help produce new policy possibilities that offer practical pathways to more integrated schools.\nIn summary, across many school districts, elementary school mergers can foster more racially/ethnically integrated schools without imposing large travel burdens on families. We hope this preliminary investigation helps equip district leaders and communities with additional evidence and tools to support their efforts to foster more inclusive learning environments."}, {"title": "Materials and Methods", "content": "Data sample\nWe begin with 2021/2022 school enrollments by race/ethnicity and grade level from the US Department of Education's Common Core of Data, along with Census block-to-school mappings released by (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023) via elementary school attendance boundaries purchased for the 2021/2022 school year. We narrow to the 6,228 local education agencies (\u201cdistricts\") with at least four elementary schools\u2014i.e., districts where there are at least a few different ways elementary schools might be merged. The data released by (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023) filtered out elementary schools that permit out-of-boundary attendance (like magnet programs whose attendance boundary overlaps with the entire district); therefore, these schools are not included in our simulations and accompanying analyses. This is appropriate for our study given that many open-enrollment schools may have specialty programs or themes (Arts, STEM, etc.) that could make it impractical to merge them with other schools not offering such programs. As in (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023), it is also impossible to estimate travel times for out-of-boundary attendees at open enrollment schools.\nAfter filtering out these open enrollment schools, we select the top 200 districts (by closed enrollment elementary school population) to include in our analysis (with a few large districts\u2014namely, Los Angeles Unified, Chicago Public Schools, and Houston Independent School District not included because the memory requirements for simulating changes in them are too demanding). Across these 200 districts, there are 9,007 elementary schools deemed as non-open-enrollment, which serve nearly 4.5 million elementary students. Our selection of 200 as the number to focus on in this study is somewhat arbitrary and driven by an effort to focus the analysis on a limited, yet still heterogeneous, sample. As our results indicate, results can vary across different districts, which further motivates the release of the online dashboard described earlier and inclusion in that dashboard of simulation results for thousands of additional districts.\nImportantly, we note that the original boundaries data used in (Gillani, Beeferman, Vega-Pourheydarian, et al., 2023) was purchased by a commercial data provider that determined a school's open enrollment status by simply observing if the school's boundaries overlapped with any other attendance boundaries in the district (if so, the school is deemed as allowing open enrollment). This means that within district choice, transfer, and other programs that do not expand the attendance boundary of a school to make them overlap with others, may not be accurately captured by that provider\u2014and hence, it is possible that some of the schools included in this study may have enrollments by students living outside of the school's designated attendance boundaries. We note this as a limitation of our data and approach that can be corrected in the future through collaborations with specific districts (who have more accurate ground truth on school enrollments), and/or an updated attendance boundary survey by the Department of Education.\nWe measure segregation using the dissimilarity index (Massey & Denton, 1988)."}, {"title": "Optimization model", "content": "We design a school mergers algorithm based on the datasets described above.

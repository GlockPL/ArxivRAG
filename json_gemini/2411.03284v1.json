While these powerful foundation models have been proven to benefit from extensive training data and larger model sizes, further scaling up these models is exceptionally costly, often requiring necessitating retraining on several trillion tokens. To overcome this limitation, multi-agent LLMs have been explored, enabling LLM systems to incorporate multiple agents, each focused on distinct objectives and tasks.\nThe layer-based structure is one of the most fundamental strategies for implementing LLM-based multi-agent systems. It involves instructing various LLMs to perform multi-agent debate (MAD) or discussion over multiple rounds to mimic human behavior in problem-solving. While effective in various applications, early layer-based methods process user queries with only one agent each time, hindering their utilization in real-world scenarios. Recently, mixture-of-agents (MoA) has been devised, which uses multiple processors per layer to handle queries simultaneously for time efficiency purposes. An aggregator then synthesizes these references to produce a final answer.\nAlthough MoA improves the time efficiency of multi-agent LLMs, it still faces significant challenges. The first issue is the high token computational cost. While MoA reduces processing time for user queries, its simultaneous processing nature increases overall computational demands, limiting scalability and severely undermining the token economy of existing multi-agent systems. The second challenge is the lack of diverse thinking among LLM agents. Unlike MAD, which explicitly encourages different viewpoints, MoA relies on agents generating responses based on previous iterations, leading to homogenization and reduced performance in tasks requiring divergent thinking.\nTo overcome the limitations of MoA and enhance the utility of multi-agent LLMs, we propose Sparse Mixture-of-Agents (SMoA), inspired by the design of sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE). Unlike fully connected structures, SMoA introduces sparsity in agent interactions through two novel agents: the Judge LLM, which selects high-quality responses for the next round, and the Moderator LLM, which controls the information flow and determines when to end it. This reduces unnecessary data processing, balancing performance with efficiency and enabling better scalability. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the expert diversity principle which is commonly applied in SMOE to balance workload, we assign distinct role descriptions to each LLM agent, facilitating diverse and divergent thinking in their problem-solving process.\nPrevious multi-agent LLMs typically focus on one or two tasks thus failing to obtain a comprehensive evaluation and understanding. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments across alignment, reasoning, safety, and fairness benchmarks to thoroughly evaluate various multi-agent LLM strategies. Our results show that SMoA performs comparably to MoA with much less computational costs. And MoA and SMOA are more stable and reliable than MAD in real-world problem-solving. Further analysis reveals that SMoA is more efficient, promotes diverse thinking, and has greater potential for scalability compared to MoA.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We identify key limitations in existing multi-agent LLM frameworks and propose a novel SMOA architecture to address them.\n\u2022 Through extensive experiments across various tasks, we demonstrate that SMoA achieves performance comparable to MoA while using significantly fewer computational resources.\n\u2022 We provide further analysis, offering insights into the comparison of different multi-agent methods and highlighting the advantages of SMoA."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "2.1 Multi-agent LLMs\nMulti-agent LLMs aim to explore the utilization of multiple LLMs as agents and direct them to work collaboratively to solve given problems. One line of work is layer-based multi-agent methods, in which multiple LLMs are prompted to debate or discuss with each other and defend their own response. Additionally, there are some works that propose mixture-of-agents, to guide various LLMs to collaborate with each other by referring to others' responses and generating their own continuation. Based on these two architectures, some other more complex structures are proposed to mimic human workflows in various domains, such as code generation and biomedical reasoning."}, {"title": "2.2 Sparse Mixture-of-Experts", "content": "The key idea in SMoE is to activate only a few experts per input, significantly reducing computational costs compared to the traditional MoE models. Several improvements have been proposed to enhance the performance and stability of sparse MoE models. Routing techniques such as dynamic routing and Hash-based routing help optimize which experts are activated, ensuring efficient resource use. Furthermore, balancing load across experts, which is first proposed by Fedus et al. addresses issues like expert imbalance, which can lead to the underutilization of certain experts and over-specialization of others. In this work, we borrow insights from SMoE to sparse the information flow between each layer in SMoA and diversify agent LLMs using role-playing."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "In this section, we begin by providing a preliminary introduction to MoA. Based on this, we illuminate the principles and details for designing our SMoA."}, {"title": "3.1 Preliminary: Mixture-of-Agents", "content": "While MoA structure for multi-agent LLMs system has been adopted by various previous studies, in this work we follow the implementation and definition from Wang et al. In their work, they assign LLMs to two distinct roles, proposers and aggregators, in their collaboration process. Proposers focus on generating useful reference responses for each other while aggregators are models proficient in synthesizing responses from other models into a single, high-quality output.\nSpecifically, the structure of MoA consist of I layers and each layer-i contains n LLMs as proposers, so we use $P_{i,1}, P_{i,2}, ..., P_{i,n}$, to denote them. In one layer, each proposer $P_{i,j}$ processes the input text and generates its continuation as a reference for the next layer. Given an input $x_1$, the output of i-th MoA layer $y_i$ can be formulated as:\n$y_i = \\underset{j=1}{\\overset{n}{\\bigodot}}[P_{i,j}(x_i)] + x_1, x_{i+1} = y_i$, (1)\nwhere $\\bigodot$ represents concatenation operation;  means the application of the aggregate-and-synthesize prompt to instruct LLMs to generate based on the previous round's output. After repeat the above mentioned process I times, the aggregator Agg will generate the final response based on the l-th layer's output $y_l$:\n$Y_{final} = Agg(y_l)$ (2)"}, {"title": "3.2 Sparse Mixture-of-Agents", "content": "To improve MoA structures and achieve better performance-efficiency balance, we draw inspiration from the concepts of SMoE. It highlights dynamically selecting only a subset of experts using the gate function to process an input, which optimizes computational efficiency while maintaining model performance. Motivated by this, we devise two new roles in our SMoA architecture:\n\u2022 Judge should conduct a comprehensive assessment and comparison to the responses generated by each processor, filtering out those in low quality and only passing a subset of high-quality and reasonable responses to the next round.\n\u2022 Moderator is the agent responsible for controlling the forward process of each processor. It should make the decision to end the processors' forward process when the multiple processors reach a consensus for efficiency consideration.\nBased on the two new agents we designed, we further propose Response Selection and Early Stopping to fully utilize them in MoA optimization."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Response Selection with Judge", "content": "In the MoA framework, while each processor in a layer generates its own continuation for a given input, it becomes crucial to decide which responses should be passed to the subsequent layer or used in the final output generation. To address this challenge, SMoA introduces a judge agent J, which plays a central role in response selection. $J$ evaluates the outputs generated by the LLMs in the current layer and determines which responses are most suitable to advance to the next round.\nSpecifically, we borrow insights from the Top-K selection in SMoE. Given an input $x_i$ and the generated response candidates $P_{i,1}(x_i), ..., P_{i,n}(x_i)$, we prompt the judge $J$ to select the best k responses and concatenate them as the input for the next iteration:\n$P_{i,1}(x_i), ..., P_{i,k}(x_i) = J(\\underset{j=1}{\\overset{k}{\\bigodot}}[P_{i,j} (x_i)]), (3)$\n$y_i = \\underset{j=1}{\\overset{n}{\\bigodot}}[P_{i,j}(x_i)] + x_1,  x_{i+1} = y_i, (4)$\nwhere k controls the sparsity of the whole agent network. By introducing Response Selection, SMOA significantly reduces noise and enhances the overall efficiency of information flowing among layers, particularly in cases where the number of LLMs in each layer is large. This method enables SMOA to balance the trade-off between efficiency in generation and the quality of the final output, leveraging the great potential of LLM-as-a-judge to guide the response forward process."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Early Stopping with Moderator", "content": "In the MoA framework, layers of LLMs generate multiple responses iteratively, passing refined outputs to subsequent layers. This process is controlled by a fixed round number. However, in some cases, continuing the process across all layers may not be necessary if a high-quality response is achieved early on or most of the processors achieve a consensus. While several previous studies propose rule-based methods to address it (e.g., stop when the output answers from most agents are the same), there is still a lack of a general and dynamic approach that can handle various tasks and applications. To manage this, SMoA introduces a moderator agent M that can dynamically assess the state of outputs at each layer and decide whether to stop the process earlier, effectively implementing an early stopping mechanism."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Role Playing with Processor", "content": "Another key mechanism in SMoE is the diversity principles among experts, to ensure the robustness and load balancing for the whole network. In SMOA, we also borrow this insight and adopt role-playing, a widely adopted technique in personalized dialogue to improve the diversity among each processor.\nSpecifically, we produce diverse role descriptions based on certain dataset description D and task requirement T, and assign these role descriptions to every proposer as their system prompt in candidate response generation:\n$r_1,...r_n = Agg_{role}(D, T, n), (6)$\n$y_i = r_i + \\underset{j=1}{\\overset{n}{\\bigodot}}[P_{i,j} (x_i)] + x_1,  x_{i+1} = y_i (7)$\nDue to the space limitation, we provide more instructions and examples in detail for both MoA and SMoA in Appendix A."}, {"title": "4 Experiment", "content": "4.1 Experiment Settings\nBenchmarks We conduct evaluation in a wide range of tasks to measure each method's alignment level, reasoning capability and safety and fairness degree. For alignment level evaluation, we use the Just-Eval benchmark, which contains diverse samples from 5 alignment datasets: (1) AlpacaEval2, (2) MT-Bench, (3) LIMA, (4) HH-RLHF-redteam and (5) MaliciousInstruct. We follow and use the GPT-4o to rate the responses for all the samples. For reasoning, we use the Massive Multitask Agent Understanding (MMAU) benchmark, which involves challenging reasoning tasks including math understanding, tool-using and code contests. Additionally, we also adopt CEB, a conversation dataset focusing on the examination of responses' fairness(e.g., toxicity and stereotype).\nCompared Method We compare the following multi-agent and ensemble methods in experiments:\n\u2022 Self-Consistency (SC) follows a sample-then-vote pattern and leverages the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer.\n\u2022 Mixture-of-Agent (MoA) is the fully-connected multi-agent framework as we introduced in Section 3.1. In our experiment, we follow the implementation of .\n\u2022 Multi-agent Debating (MAD) prompts multiple agents to debate with each other to encourage diverse and divergent thinking in the generation process.\n\u2022 Sparse Mixture-of-Agent (SMoA) is our novelly proposed architecture which incorporates response selection, early stopping and role-playing"}, {"title": "4.2 Main Result", "content": "Overall Comparison We begin by comparing the performance of different methods in each dataset . For Just-Eval, SC, MoA and SMOA significantly improve the baseline performance, while MAD results in a performance decline. Notably, SMoA and MoA exhibit comparable results in the alignment task, even when compared with the powerful GPT-4o model. In the MMAU dataset, SC stands out with exceptional performance, considerably boosting the baselines. MoA and SMoA also provide consistent improvements, whereas MAD fails to deliver positive results. For the CEB dataset, SMoA emerges as the best for reducing baselines' toxicity and stereotypes, achieving the best results in three out of the four baseline LLMs. MoA and SC follow as the second and third best methods, while MAD again decreases baseline performance.\nIn summary: (1) MoA and SMoA offer consistent and comparable improvements across all three tasks. (2) SC outperforms MoA and SMOA in reasoning tasks but falls behind in alignment and fairness. (3) MAD is the least effective method, leading to performance drops in almost every task.\nComparison of multi-agent methods. To gain a more fine-grained and deeper understanding of each multi-agent method, we provide a direct comparison in Figures 3a and 3b with Qwen2-72B-Instruct. In Figure 3a, we analyze alignment and fairness attributes using the Just-Eval and CEB datasets. Both MoA and SMoA improve the single-agent baseline in terms of depth and engagement, while also reducing stereotypes and toxicity. Interestingly, we find that although MAD performs competitively in terms of helpfulness and safety, it underperforms the baseline in all other aspects. We attribute this to the binary nature of debate, which may limit diverse thinking in real-world scenarios. In Figure 3b, we evaluate the reasoning capabilities of each method across three MMAU sub-sets. We notice MoA consistently enhances the single LLM baseline's performance across all tasks. While SMoA's improvement is slightly less than MoA's, it still delivers consistent enhancement. However, MAD's impact on the baseline is mixed: it significantly boosts math understanding but reduces performance in the tool and code subsets. Based on these observations, we conclude that layer-based architectures (such as MoA and SMoA) are generally more stable and reliable than the debate-based approach for multi-agent LLMs."}, {"title": "5 Further Analysis", "content": "In this section, we conduct in-depth analyses to understand SMoA thoroughly and provide further insights for future works. We summarize our findings and conclusions below.\nResponse number is an important hyper-parameter in SMoA. We conducted an ablation study on Response Selection, with the results presented in Table 4. The results suggest that while Response Selection improves efficiency, it seems to also reduce performance in MMAU and CEB. To better understand its impact, we performed a hyper-parameter analysis on the selected response number k. As shown in Figure 5, the model's performance exhibits a clear pattern that initially improves as k increases (when k = 1, 2, 3), then declines (when k = 4). Notably, the model achieved optimal performance across all three datasets when k = 3, indicating a balance between the informativeness and quality of the selected reference responses. These findings emphasize that the number of selected responses is a critical hyper-parameter in SMoA, essential for balancing efficiency and performance.\nEarly Stopping sacrifices a little performance for a huge efficiency boost. As shown in Table 4, the ablation results for Early Stopping reveal a slight performance decline across three datasets when this mechanism is removed. However, there is a remarkable increase in costs, with the average rising from 1.75 to 3.70 per dataset. These findings underscore the significant effectiveness of Early Stopping in enhancing the efficiency of SMoA, at the cost of sacrificing a little performance. Additionally, we observe that removing Early Stopping results in higher costs than the original MoA (3.70 vs. 3.25), which is due to the additional prompt tokens required for Role-playing and Response Selection. This further hints at the importance of Early Stopping in the SMoA framework.\nDivergent thinking brought by Role-playing benefits both the reasoning capability and fairness of multi-agent LLMs. When the Role-playing module is removed (Table 4), we observe a significant performance drop in MMAU and CEB, which are closely related to the LLMs' reasoning and fairness capabilities. This suggests that the divergent and diverse thinking fostered by the role-playing process greatly benefits multi-agent LLMs in these areas. This finding is also consistent with previous studies that focus on reasoning and fairness Furthermore, in conjunction with the results from Section 4.2, we conclude that diverse role-playing is more effective than binary debating in enabling multi-agent LLMs to analyze and solve problems comprehensively.\nSMoA shows greater potential for scaling up. Scalability is a crucial factor in evaluating multi-agent LLM systems. To address this, we conducted a scaling analysis to compare SMOA with MoA in terms of their ability to scale. Specifically, we incorporated additional LLM processors and monitored the performance and token cost trends as the number of"}, {"title": "5.1 Case Study", "content": "We present an example in Table 6 to more clearly illustrate the effectiveness of Response Selection and Early Stopping. As shown, the responses from Qwen2-72B-Instruct and Qwen1.5-72B-Chat are correct, while those from Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 and dbrx-instruct are incorrect. Notably, the judge agent successfully selects the correct responses and filters out the incorrect ones, preventing potential misguidance during the aggregation process. Additionally, the moderator agent triggers Early Stopping based on the current response states, enhancing SMoA's efficiency in both time and computational resources. In all, SMoA performs well in identifying reasoning error and filtering out unsafe content or misinformation and moderating the information exchange process.\n$\\Delta \\theta = \\alpha \\cdot (R-b) \\cdot \\nabla log P(attention \\ weights)$ (8)"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents the SMoA architecture, designed to enhance the efficiency and diversity of multi-agent LLM systems.

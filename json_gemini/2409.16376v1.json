While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current educational research, multimodal capabilities such as text-to-speech and text-to-image-are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive literature search using Dimensions.ai yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary, this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in education.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Whether you have experience in Education 2.0 [18], Education 3.0 [90], Education 4.0 [66], Education 5.0 [55], or even already in Education 6.0 [58], you might have thought of how artificial intelligence (AI) could acceptably and responsibly [62] realize its \"potential for reshaping the core foundations of education, teaching and learning\" [84, p. 3]. Recently, the UNESCO Guidance for generative AI in education and research noted that developments in generative AI might trigger a transformative change in established educational systems and"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Various AI-driven pedagogical and technological solutions are emerging at an accelerating pace, creating both possibilities and tensions [3, 62]. At the same time, organizations and legislators, such as the EU, strive to keep up with opportunities and challenges. For example, the recently published EU Regulation No. 2024/1689 (Artificial Intelligence Act), which aims to harmonize rules on AI, regulates issues such as emotion recognition in educational contexts. From the educational standpoint, a key challenge arises when research-based knowledge is unevenly distributed across different perspectives and technologies, with market leaders heavily impacting the landscape of AI in education [e.g., 88]. For instance, if technological advances primarily drive various pedagogical approaches, it is crucial to recognize the influence this has. It is equally important to discern what aspects of these technologies are hype and which areas risk being overlooked [e.g., 37, 79, 54, 96].\nFrom the historical perspective, the fields of artificial intelligence and ed-ucation have been closely linked since the inception of AI, with early AI pio-neers contributing to both areas by using AI to understand and improve human learning, a perspective that has since been argued to be diminished but still revivable [24]. Also, computational methods for performing transformations between different data modalities have existed, for example, for text-to-text, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text since the 1950s [38, 44, 22] and text to im-age since the 2000s [2]. Recently, deep learning has allowed the development of other transformations like text-to-video, video-to-text [67], and text-to-music [10]. These multimodal capabilities are suggested to benefit education [12], and multimodal AI is claimed to possess even an \"immense\" [51, p. 2] and \"vast\" [57, p. 271] potential. Thus, both AI research and educational research together [14] should investigate the multimodal and generative capabilities of these so-called foundation models [6] to ensure \u201chuman-centered and pedagogically appropriate interaction\" [85, p. 29].\nRecently, reviews have identified main application areas of AI in education like assessment, administration, prediction, AI assistants, content delivery, intel-ligent tutoring systems, and managing student learning, while also highlighting challenges such as negative perceptions, technology skills gaps, ethical concerns,"}, {"title": "3 Materials and methods", "content": "and AI tool design issues [19, 20]. Higher education and the educational do-mains of medical, language, engineering, and computing education have received the most attention in research [96, 19]. Future research should examine trans-parency, bias mitigation, curriculum design, and ethical usage to enhance edu-cational practices across various disciplines [5]. In general, an extensive body of research on AI in education highlights a broad range of applications, theories, and methodologies [e.g., 91].\nHowever, the development of AI technologies for education is still argued to lag behind, with most tools being simple, single-purpose, and not tailored to interdisciplinary learning needs, highlighting the need for researchers to examine and design more advanced, versatile AI tools for education [14]. For example, while the long-existed text-to-speech technology has shown promising potential for improving writing performance, spelling, and reading comprehension among adolescents with learning difficulties, the amount of high-quality research in this area remains limited, indicating the need for further investigation [54]. In general, multimodal capabilities of generative AI in educational research have received limited attention because existing research has focused primarily on text-to-text models [12, 54]. Also, the prior reviews have often suffered from inconsistencies [96] and ambiguity of the concept of AI [37]. Thus, the novelty of this research was the extensive search string incorporating a relatively broad set of multimodal capabilities of generative AI."}, {"title": "3.1 Data collection", "content": "Data collection was conducted in August 2024 using Dimensions.ai service, and a complementary search was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science (WOS). However, the complementary search did not yield any new results. Dimen-sions.ai is argued to provide an extensive literature coverage [e.g., 82, 89]. Also, when selecting the example articles, we found that at least one article, [71], was found only using Dimensions.ai."}, {"title": "3.2 Topic modeling", "content": "Focusing on student perspective, the following search string was used to search articles, proceedings, and book chapters based on title and abstract with no limitations to publishing year:\n(education OR student OR school) AND (\u2019generative ai' OR 'gener-\native artificial intelligence' OR genai OR LLM OR 'large language\nmodel' OR 'text-to-text' OR 'text-to-video' OR 'text-to-audio' COM-\nBINATIONS\nThe last part of the search string COMBINATIONS consisted of all combina-tions of different modalities between text, video, audio, voice, sound, music, data, image, speech, graph, table, emotion, language, and gesture. Notably, to allow more unbiased review of technologies, no service names (e.g., ChatGPT) were included in the search string. The initial search yielded 4475 results. After removing results that did not contain a Document Object Identifier (DOI) or abstract, the final dataset consisted of 4175 articles, forming the text corpus for topic modeling (Figure 1). 95% of the articles were published after 2014. The earliest relevant article in this corpus was from 1983, mentioning a computa-tional approach for transforming data modalities in an educational context that dealt with text-to-speech support for visually impaired students [63].\nTo extract latent topics from the text corpus (Figure 1), we applied the BERTopic approach [32], which has been suggested to be able to generate novel insight and encode contextual information by relying on sentence transformers and em-beddings [26]. BERTopic approach has been utilized, for example, to explore dynamics of AI applications [70] and interdisciplinary topics in science [92].\nFirstly, we created transformer-based embeddings of the abstracts using the general-purpose sentence transformer all-mpnet-base-v21. The transformer has been trained, among many other datasets, using over 116 million English-language academic papers from The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC)2 [50]. Secondly, the created 768-dimensional document embeddings were then dimensional reduced using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Pro-jection (UMAP) [56]. Thirdly, using the reduced embeddings, the documents were clustered by applying the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm [8]. Finally, English stop-words were removed, and the class-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (c-TF-IDF) approach was used to generate initial topics. Topics were reviewed and interpreted by the authors.\nBoth UMAP and HDBSCAN require several hyperparameters to perform dimensionality reduction and clustering. Instead of arbitrarily choosing the parameters, topic count, or topic size, we employed a parameter search approach"}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "by randomly sampling combinations of parameters for UMAP and HDBSCAN (Figure 1). This allowed us to explore various parameters without exhaustively testing every combination. Specifically, we performed 5000 iterations, each time selecting random values for key parameters, such as the number of neighbors (range [2, 55]), minimum distance (0.0 or 0.1), and distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, cosine) for UMAP, as well as the minimum cluster size (range [2, 55]), minimum samples (range [2, 55]), clustering method (leaf, eom), and distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean) for HDBSCAN (Figure 4).\nThe optimal hyperparameter solution for this research was selected based on the Density-based Clustering Validation (DBCV) index[60], topic count, and out-of-topic abstract count. The DBCV index is a metric that can be used to assess the quality of clustering by evaluating the density-based separation between clusters and the cohesion within clusters. The optimal solution aimed to obtain a feasible number of topics while leaving the minimum number of abstracts not assigned to any topic. In other words, a clustering solution (i.e., number of topics) for each solution in the set of all clustering solutions S that minimizes the number of out-of-topic documents and maximizes the DBCV index was assessed as follows:\n$S^* = \\arg \\max_{S_i \\in S'} D(S_i) \\text{ where } S' = \\arg \\min_{S_i \\in S} O(S_i)$,\nwhere O(S) represent the number of out-of-topic (i.e., not assigned abstracts) documents for solution Si and D(Si) represent the DBCV index for solution Si. Figure 3 depicts the solutions in S* for solutions having the number of topics ]1, 150[. In this research, the number of topics less than 20 were considered too general, and more than 150 were considered not feasible for a human to interpret qualitatively. In the selected topic model, the interpretability of a single topic was assessed using information entropy: the lower the entropy of a topic, the more likely it is to be considered a valid topic [92]. Lastly, the topics were arranged as a thematic map combining similar topics to higher-level representations [7]."}, {"title": "4.1 Different modalities", "content": "OpenAI ChatGPT showed the most occurrences in the corpus compared to sim-ilar types of generative AI services like Google Gemini or Bard, Microsoft Copi-lot, Anthropic Claude, and Perplexity.ai (Table 1). However, some keywords can refer to a form of generative AI with various meanings in the literature. The term copilot is used, for example, to denote various interactive compan-ions \"that can follow diverse instructions and coherently and accurately answer complex open-ended questions in natural language\" [51, p. 2]. On the other hand, copilot can also refer to a specific software like Microsoft Copilot [e.g., 31] or GitHub Copilot [e.g., 87]. Similarly, the term perplexity can refer to an information theoretical measure [e.g., 94] or a software called Perplexity.ai [e.g.,"}, {"title": "4.2 Topic modeling", "content": "73]. While there is a lack of precise conventions for naming used technologies, OpenAI ChatGPT seems to dominate the research concerning LLMs in edu-cation, which is not surprising considering the simplicity of its operation [e.g., 74] and prior similar review results [e.g., 5]. Including specific product names in the literature, search string can yield different results, but this research ad-dressed literature that explicitly mentioned different generative models instead of specific software services.\nA topic modeling approach was used to further summarize the corpus of ab-stracts. The first step was to obtain a reasonable set of hyperparameters for modeling by randomly sampling combinations of parameters. Figure 3 shows the best solutions for each number of clusters (i.e., the number of topics) based on minimizing the number of not assigned abstracts and maximizing the DBCV index. A feasible number of topics, with a topic count of 54, was selected as the optimal solution for obtained hyperparameters and study context.

The thematic analysis synthesized the topics into 14 key focus areas (capi-talized and in different colors in Figure 5), each encompassing various lower-level\ntopics (in lowercase in Figure 5), offering insights into the prominence and scale of different research domains. The findings suggest that generative AI technolo-gies, particularly OpenAI ChatGPT, dominate educational research, reflecting the focused interest and rapid adoption of LLMs in academic contexts. However, the results also highlight the potential of AI incorporating different modalities (e.g., text-to-speech [77], speech-to-text [46], and text-to-image [41]) in person-alized learning, problem-solving, and creativity, areas that have received less attention compared to LLMs dealing with text-to-text transformations.\nThe results align and support the findings from the other recent literature, arguing that there is a need to extend the research to other technologies across educational levels. To emphasize, the next common technology after LLMs found in this research, text-to-speech, is argued to have a limited number of high-quality research [54]. Also, the only educational level identified at a topic level in this research was higher education, which supports the claims that there is limited research on other levels (e.g., K-12) [96, 86, 20].\nGenerative AI can challenge the foundational aspects of learning and edu-cation. Some authors argue that generative AI reflects a surface approach to learning and a \u201cfunctionalist and economist vision of society\" [16, p. 231]. Thus, to protect and enhance student agency [36, 35], we need to have a broad under-standing of different AI technologies [85]. For example, while LLMs can offer assistance in drafting and editing [49], they also raise questions about academic integrity, as the ease of generating text may compromise the originality of stu-dent work [29, 52]. In other words, there seems to be a tension between using LLMs as supportive tools to help students improve their skills and the grow-ing concerns about plagiarism and the authenticity of student work generated through these technologies.\nFor students creating new knowledge in the AI era, the challenge is at the same time mastering the subject matter and reusing knowledge acquired through generative AI [16]. AI for education could greatly benefit from AI models delib-erately trained to serve educational needs (e.g., EdGPTs) [85]. Also, integrating multimodal AI-driven tools for visual and auditory content could extend possi-bilities beyond the capabilities of traditional LLMs by offering richer and more dynamic learning experiences. In addition to medical education, language ed-ucation, and the natural sciences, fields such as the arts, social sciences, and humanities could also benefit from multimodal approaches in generative AI by enhancing creativity [86], critical and creative thinking [41, 80], and interac-tive learning experiences [4]. Thus, the research could examine the potential of educationally focused multimodal foundation models that balance knowledge building and knowledge reproduction in different domains of learning end edu-cation.\nThis study has its limitations. Topic modeling of a large corpus offers a gen-eral and high-level view of the underlying content, leaving more nuanced and emerging topics hidden. The extensive search string used in this study did not capture all variations of product names associated with generative AI technolo-gies. Thus, it is recommended that future research adopt a harmonized approach to describing the underlying technologies to facilitate more comprehensive cov-"}]}

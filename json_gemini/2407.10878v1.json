However, existing methods face challenges in assessing the impact of shocks, such as the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war. In this context, we apply deep neural network-based Granger causality to identify important drivers of natural gas demand. Furthermore, the resulting dependencies are used to construct a counterfactual case without the outbreak of the war, providing a quantifiable estimate of the overall effect of the shock on various German energy sectors.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The Russia-Ukraine conflict has introduced significant un-certainties in the German and European natural gas markets. Understanding the causal elements behind demand fluctuations and accurately quantifying the conflict's impact is crucial for future energy planning and strategy. It is intuitive to formulate such a task as a prediction problem, i.e., the predict the post-conflict energy price. Traditionally, forecasting in this area leaned heavily on linear regression models, time series methods, and other statistical techniques [9]. While these con-ventional methodologies can have their strengths, they often exhibit limitations, especially when dealing with non-linear relationships (especially non-stationarity from the conflict) and multiple influencing factors simultaneously. Recently, deep learning models have excelled in analyzing vast amounts of information efficiently, capturing nonlinear relationships, and unearthing patterns and correlations that might be missed by traditional statistical methods [29]. Beyond prediction, another more important topic will be analyzing whether and how much the conflict has impacted the energy market. Causal analysis offers a foundational framework to answer such a question. Applying these two approaches in combination can be especially valuable. In this line of thought, the following two research questions are investigated:\nRQ1: Generally, which factors can best describe the pat-terns of various German energy sectors (including residential, industrial, and gas power plant) so that, ideally, we could use them for better prediction?\nRQ2: How does the war affect German energy sectors differently, and is it possible to explain and even quantify these impacts in the long run?\nTo address these challenges, this paper adopts a three-pronged approach, with an overview in Fig. 1. Firstly, the different sets of data are investigated based on mutual informa-tion, to tailor different selection of factors for different sector. Then, non-linear Granger causality tests [10] are applied based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks [13], to identify which factors exhibit a strong influence. Thirdly, an LSTM and a prophet network [42] based prediction is generated as a counterfactual scenario for the war period to estimate the effect of the war on natural gas demand.\nThis paper offers three main contributions to the extant research on forecasting energy demand. First, it proposes a simple and accurate prediction model using deep learning tools for the natural gas demand that is facing unprecedented issues in Germany. Second, the study reveals and quantifies the causal effect of war on future natural gas demand, including residential, industrial, and gas power plant sectors in Germany. Finally, when there are significant shocks to the system, like wars or other unexpected events, the proposed models can be swiftly adapted to different natural gas demand forecasting areas based on the updated information.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews earlier research on forecasting methods of energy demand. Section III introduces the research approach. Section IV shows the results, including the selection of influencing factors, nonlinear Granger causality analysis, and intervention studies regarding the effect of war on German natural gas de-mand across different sectors. Section V gives the conclusion."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "A. Prediction Methods for Natural Gas Demand\nThere has been abundant research in time series predic-tion based on various techniques such as statistical models [14], tensor [19]\u2013[24], [37], [43], [47], [49], deep learning [6], [11], [46], contrastive learning [18], [31], [33], [44], and Large Language Models (LLMs) [26], [27], [48]. It is challenging to forecast natural gas demand (NGD) due to the complex interplay of long-term trends, short-term seasonality, and uncertainties. Existing machine learning works utilize a"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "A. Research Approach\nThree sectors of gas consumption will be considered sep-arately, namely residential gas demand (LDZ), industrial gas demand (IND) and gas to power generation demand (GTP), which we believe will be affected by the conflict differently due to their nature. The aggregated natural gas demand is denoted as NGD. For example, LDZ represents domestic and small commercial consumers, which has been found to be more influenced by temperature and holidays [28]. IND is likely correlated with economic indicators. GTP will likely depend strongly on the overall gas supply. As shown in Fig. 1, the process begins with selecting influencing factors that are determined through exploratory data analysis and mutual information analysis [15]. The subsequent step involves applying deep learning in non-linear Granger-Causality tests to determine if the selected factors can indeed predict changes in (NGD). These tests validate the capacity of selected predictors to provide a reliable forecast of NGD and ensure that only the most relevant predictors are included in the model. Finally, the refined data are incorporated into the deep learning interven-tion studies to forecast NGD in the context of the post-war scenario in Germany."}, {"title": "IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS", "content": "A. Data Exploration and Mutual Information Analysis\nIn the dataset, a number of dependencies are found. As shown in Fig. 2(a), a pronounced linear relation between NGD and HDD suggests that colder temperatures elevate gas demand. This trend is consistent even when considering lagged HDD, reinforcing the direct linear relationship between temperature and gas demand. For the other variables, no linear relationship is found. Fig. 2(b) provides a quantitative overview by mutual information analysis of the significant determinants influencing gas demand across various sectors. For aggregated demand (NGD), the primary driving forces are HDD, lagged 1 HDD (HDD-1), Russian gas flow into Europe (RUS), Workday patterns, and monthly variations. This is further supplemented by geopolitical events (War), as well as the production of renewable energy sources such as German wind energy and German solar energy. The LDZ sector is broadly influenced by similar factors but has an added empha-sis on French nuclear power production. IND sector gas de-mand showcases a blend of climatic conditions (HDD, HDD-1), natural gas origins (Rus, UK NL Production), and THE Price, alongside renewable energy inputs. Meanwhile, the GTP sector is majorly swayed by most of the influencing factors, ranging from monthly fluctuations in geopolitical events to a set of renewable energy sources and pricing mechanics. The selection of influencing factors on German NGD summarized below would capture approximately 90% quantile of mutual information in each sector. The geopolitical event (the War) and natural gas import dynamics (Rus) have been included in each sector to intricate interplay of geopolitical events in shaping the gas demand landscape across these sectors.\nB. Nonlinear Granger Causality\nGranger causality is the popular choice to examine the causal relations among time-series. Standard approaches to Granger causality detection commonly assume linear dynam-ics, due to the nonlinearity, we adopted a non-linear Granger causality test based on LSTM to analyze the dependencies of"}, {"title": "IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS", "content": "gas demands. The key idea of Granger causality is: a time series x is said to be Granger-cause of another time series y if past values of x provide significant information about the future values of y beyond what is already provided by the past values of y itself. Thus, a statistical test will be conducted by comparing the following two:\n$Y_t = f_1(y_{t-\\tau:t-1}, Z_{t-\\tau:t-1}) + e$\n$Y_t = f_1(y_{t-\\tau:t-1}, Z_{t-\\tau:t-1} + X_{t-\\tau:t-1}) + e'$\nx being the cause of y = Wilcoxon-test(yt, Yt)\nwhere for example, our y, y' is each energy demand (GTP to NGD), x is the each predictor in Fig. 3, the Z are the other control variables for prediction, \u03c4 is the lag length, e is the error, and f\u2081(\u00b7) is the one-step prediction model, i.e., LSTM. Since LSTM may not follow the assumed F-distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a non-parametric test, is used to compare the two [39]. The p-values are shown in Fig. 3: While HDD only appears to have a significant non-linear Granger causal relationship with LDZ demand, HDD-1 shows notable nonlinear Granger causality with IND as well as LDZ. The gas price only has a direct influence on the industrial gas demand IND. Besides, a large proportion of predictors like EU storage, EU LNG, and Workday consistently show p-values gravitate towards or equal 1 across all NGD sectors which indicates an absence of non-linear Granger causality. These findings highlight the need to identify other key factors that can strongly predict outcomes in future research studies. Additionally, the predictor War exhibits a significant non-linear Granger causality with LDZ, with an extremely small p-values of 1.1\u00d710-16.\nWe also use Prophet as a base model, i.e., f(\u00b7) = Prophet. Due to space limits, we only conclude the common insights: for example, IND gas demand depends on DE wind and THE price. LDZ depends on HDD-1 and UK NL production, and the overall NGD depends on DE index, DE wind, and HDD.\nC. Counterfactual Intervention Studies\nTo explore the effect of the war on natural gas demand, a counterfactual intervention study is conducted. As a baseline, a prediction is taken without the data from the onset of the war, comparing it to the actual development.\n$Y_t^{w. war} = f_1(Z_{t-\\tau:t-1}, x_{t-\\tau:t-1}^{war}) + \\epsilon_1 (prediction)$\n$y_t^{wo. war} = f_{t-t_{war}}(Z_{t^{war}-\\tau:t^{war}}) + e_2 (counterfactual)$  (2)\nwhere Z is all the other predicting factors except the war dummy variable, and fh(\u00b7) is the h-step prediction model, and we used both LSTM and Prophet. To predict the case without war, only training data (without the war dummy variable) before the twar is used, but a multi-step prediction is needed, with t \u2212 twar steps. Otherwise, to predict the war case, all the historical data can be used, and additionally with a war dummy xwar.\nFig. 4 presents sector-specific impacts in million cubic meters (mcm) per day of the intervention Russia-Ukraine War on German NGD. Fig. 5 expresses deltas as percentages, meaning the relative deviation of forecasts from actual NGD."}, {"title": "V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "content": "The purpose of this paper is to integrate deep learning models within a causal analysis framework to evaluate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on German natural gas demand. The impact of the war on German natural gas demand is heterogeneously distributed across different gas sectors. The intervention study, constructing a counterfactual predicted time series hints at the capabilities could be derived from applying this approach in a broader scope. Even though the effect found here is rather small, it shows promising results in uncovering the causal effect of shocks using predictive methods.\nWe acknowledge the limitation in long-term forecasting accuracy since the prediction error will accumulate [41]. Despite this limitation, the adaptability of deep learning models remains as a strong asset to navigate and understand complex energy demand dynamics in times of geopolitical uncertainty."}]}

Crop simulation models, which align with physical processes, offer explainability but often perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning (ML) models for crop modeling are powerful and scalable yet operate as black boxes and lack adherence to crop growth's physical principles. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function. Leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, climate data, simulated water use data, and pixel-level yield data, our model demonstrates high accuracy, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77-matching or surpassing state-of-the-art models like RNNs and Transformers. Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In response to climate change, closing the gap between potential and actual yields is an urgent task to sustain food security [Fischer et al., 2012]. Extreme weather conditions like droughts and floodings are pressing challenges in the agricultural sector, directly affecting productivity, and causing yield losses [Arora, 2019, Molotoks et al., 2021]. Digital agriculture has emerged as a key strategy to address these challenges, providing tools for timely, informed decision-making by policymakers, industry stakeholders, and farmers [Roscher et al., 2023]. The response of crop yields to water availability has been a central focus of research for decades, serving as a critical parameter in assessing crop resilience under extreme climate conditions [Pereira et al., 2015]. Traditionally, simulation models, also known as process-based models, have been employed to capture this relationship. These models build upon biological and physical principles to offer high explainability, supporting decisions in areas such as irrigation, fertilization, pest management, and disease control. However, crop simulation models often struggle with high-resolution, multidimensional data, are computationally intensive, and require calibration, rendering their applicability to high spatial resolution (pixel-level) unfeasible. Furthermore, they are often simplified representations of reality, relying on approximations to maintain computational efficiency [Kang et al., 2009], oftentimes resulting in inaccurate performances [Leng and Hall, 2020].\nTherefore, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly utilized for crop productivity estimation [Van Klompenburg et al., 2020]. Recent studies demonstrate impressive scalability and accuracy, even at pixel resolution [Helber et al., 2023, Pathak et al., 2023], by handling complex and multidimensional data [Miranda et al., 2024]. However, ML models are often criticized for their black-box characteristics, limiting their interpretability [Castelvecchi, 2016]. Additionally, ML are seldomly designed to follow underlying physical principles of plant growth [He et al., 2023], thereby hardly ever providing meaningful intermediate outputs, which are essential for tracking crop responses to changing environmental conditions over time. There is a growing demand to integrate the strengths of data-driven ML approaches with the interpretability of simulation models [Dash et al., 2022, Kang et al., 2009]. While some recent studies attempt to combine ML and prior knowledge for yield prediction, also under water-limited conditions [Shuai and Basso, 2022], these approaches generally focus on data enrichment rather than on producing interpretable and physical consistent sequential outputs of crop physiology, similar to simulation models. Consequently, they often retain the black-box limitations of conventional ML models, providing limited insight into crop physiology by potentially violating governing physical principles.\nThis study seeks to bridge the gap between interpretable simulation models and high-performance ML models by introducing a physics-informed approach to crop yield loss forecasting. We argue that we can learn more precisely the water use and the crop susceptibility to water scarcity, by building upon Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral imagery, climate data, and simulations, coupled with pixel-level yield data from cereal crops harvested between 2017\u20132021 in Switzerland. We demonstrate yield loss estimation at the pixel level, grounded on physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity [Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979], using an enhanced loss function. Initial results indicate high potential, achieving an R2 of up to 0.77, matching or surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML models for yield prediction, including RNNs and Transformers, while providing interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Problem Definition The water use, also called evapotranspiration (ET), is the sum of all biophysical processes in which liquid water is converted to water vapor from various surfaces, including topsoil and vegetation. For a specific crop type, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) differentiates between the maximum (ET) and the actual ET ($ET_a$). The former represents the water use under standard and non-limiting environmental conditions and is solely impacted by climate conditions and crop specifics, achieving full productivity, i.e., disease-free, well-fertilized, and under optimum soil water conditions. In contrast, the $ET_a$ represents the water use under limiting environmental conditions, resulting in a reduction in water use and ultimately causing a reduction of crop productivity. This reduction in productivity is defined as yield loss and typically expressed in relative terms. Various factors cause productivity limiting conditions, including soil infertility, soil salinity, limited soil water content, diseases, and poor management. Especially, in the light of extreme weather conditions, the frequency of severe droughts and floodings is expected to increase, causing either water scarcity or water abundance, negatively impacting ET and crop productivity [Kang et al., 2009, Arora, 2019]. Assessing the reduction in $ET_a$ is a major challenge in agriculture. A detailed description of biophysical processes of the ET is described by the FAO-56 method [Allen et al., 1998], using the Penman-Monteith equation, recommended for daily ET (mm/day) estimation. The ET under limiting condition is defined by:\n$ET_a = K_s ET_x,$                                                                                                                                                                   (1)\nwith $K_s$ being a stress coefficient, resulting in a reduction of the $ET_x$.

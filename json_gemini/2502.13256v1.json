INTRODUCTION", "content": "In our connected world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems that combine computation and physical processes, changing the way we live and work. These systems integrate digital technology with physical actions, and they are all around us, playing an important role in industries like healthcare, transportation, energy, and manufacturing [1], [2]. Imagine a world where driver-less cars make smart decisions on the road, power grids adjust themselves to meet energy demand, and medical devices communicate instantly to save lives [3]. All of these things are possible because of CPS, which link computer systems with physical actions, creating smarter and more adaptive solutions. CPS not only make things more efficient but also add a level of accuracy and resilience that traditional systems cannot match [4].\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an important part of CPS. IoT is a specific type of CPS that involves devices linked together to share data over a network [5], [6]. Both involve physical devices connected to computers, but IoT specifically refers to devices that are linked together and share data over a network. Just like CPS, IoT systems can experience anomalies, which are unusual behaviors caused by things like system errors or even attacks, as shown in fig 1, this is a type of anomaly detection [7]\u2013[9]. Some researchers focus on finding and fixing these anomalies in IoT systems to keep them safe and working properly. Similarly, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are critical components that manage and oversee industrial processes. ICS are widely used in sectors such as manufacturing, power generation, and water treatment to ensure that physical processes are controlled efficiently and safely [10]\u2013[12].\nAnomalies in CPS are deviations from normal operational behavior that may indicate security threats, system malfunctions, or faults. These deviations can take various forms, including unexpected changes in sensor readings, unusual network traffic patterns, irregular actuator behavior, deviations in control commands, unauthorized access attempts, and anomalous packet structures. Anomalies can broadly be categorized into two types: attacks and faults. Attacks encompass various malicious activities such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, packet injection, unauthorized protocol use, and dictionary attacks targeting web interfaces. Faults, on the other hand, arise from unexpected issues within the system, such as sensor and actuator malfunctions, which can disrupt normal operations and degrade system performance. Detecting these anomalies is important due to the integration of heterogeneous technologies and the interaction between cyber and physical components in CPS. The challenge lies in identifying these deviations amidst the complex and dynamic nature of these systems. Anomalies can signal a range of issues, from benign system errors to sophisticated cyberattacks, making their timely detection essential for maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of CPS [7], [13]\u2013[22].\nAnomaly detection plays a crucial role in CPS as it helps identify irregular behaviors that deviate from the system's normal operations. Anomalies can often result from malicious attacks targeting the system, and such deviations from expected behavior can have significant consequences. In the context of CPS, anomalies can lead to system failures, financial losses, and even endanger human lives. Therefore, ensuring the safety and security of CPS by effectively detecting and addressing anomalies is vital for system stability and reliability [23], [24].\nMost of the research papers in the field of anomaly detection focus on physical-based CPS or physical-based anomaly detection [25]. These systems and methods emphasize the monitoring and analysis of physical components and processes within a CPS, such as sensors, actuators, and mechanical parts [26]. Since these physical elements are directly tied to real-world operations, they play a critical role in identifying and addressing anomalies [27]."}, {"title": "Physical-based anomaly detection relies on understanding", "content": "Physical-based anomaly detection relies on understanding the physical behavior of the system. This includes tracking parameters like temperature, pressure, vibration, and flow rates to identify any deviations from normal conditions. For instance, in a manufacturing plant, abnormal vibrations in a motor might signal a mechanical failure, while unusual pressure readings in a pipeline could indicate a potential leak. These approaches typically use sensor data to detect problems in real-time [28]\u2013[30]. Sensors continuously monitor the physical aspects of the system, providing data that can be analyzed for irregular patterns. For example, techniques like threshold-based monitoring can quickly flag values that exceed safe operational limits, while more advanced methods like machine learning models can identify subtler patterns that may indicate early signs of failure [31], [32].\nIn recent years, many research papers [13], [33]\u2013[35] introduce new methods for detecting anomalies in CPS. These methods are diverse, and each paper presents a different approach. For this survey, we have chosen the most important papers in the field. Although each paper uses a unique method, we have classified them into a few main groups.\nThis paper presents existing solutions by providing a comprehensive survey that seeks to answer the key questions: Which methodologies have been used for anomaly detection in CPS over recent years?\nTo do this, the paper categorizes and compares various anomaly detection methods for CPS, including machine learning, deep learning, mathematical, hybrid, invariant-based, and other approaches. By exploring the strengths and weaknesses of these diverse methods, this survey aims to provide a balanced understanding of their accuracy, efficiency, and suitability for different CPS environments. The goal of this survey is to present and analyze existing solutions for creating a safer and more reliable CPS environment. By examining advanced anomaly detection methods that can work in real-time and adapt to changing conditions, this survey aims to highlight the gaps left by current solutions. As CPS continue to grow and change, our security solutions must evolve accordingly. This paper aims to ensure that the systems we depend on are not only smarter but also safer, keeping them secure, efficient, and ready to meet the needs of an increasingly automated world.\nRoadmap. We provide an overview of CPS and related systems, such as ICS and IoT, highlighting their relationships and importance in various sectors in Section II. In Section III, we discuss the primary security challenges faced by CPS, including system-level vulnerabilities, threats, and mitigation strategies. In Section IV, we provide a detailed survey of anomaly detection techniques used in CPS, which is divided into multiple categories: machine learning approaches, deep learning methods, hybrid techniques, mathematical approaches, and invariant-based methods. Each of these sections explores specific detection methodologies, their strengths, and their applicability to different CPS environments and in section V we provide a general view of anomaly detection. In Section VII, we talk about the importance of real-time anomaly detection. Finally, we provide the future work in section VIII and the conclusion in section IX."}, {"title": "II. OVERVIEW OF CPS AND ICS", "content": "CPS combine computers and physical processes, working together through embedded computers and networks to monitor, control, and integrate these processes smoothly [26], [36], [37]. CPS tightly link software and hardware, allowing systems to handle tasks like real-time data processing, autonomous control, and quick adjustments [38]. These systems, as described by several scholars, are known for their ability to work reliably and adaptively in various environments, needing new methods that combine physical actions and computer models [39]. CPS uses embedded computing, sensors, and network communication to go beyond traditional control systems, enabling smart and software-driven operations in areas like autonomous vehicles, space exploration, medical devices, and industrial automation [40], [41].\nCPS is vital in developing the Internet of Things (IoT), offering and using online data-accessing and data-processing services [42]. This connection and interaction between physical and cyber parts highlight the importance of their integration, not just their combination [36]. The complex nature of CPS requires a broad approach that combines knowledge from system science, engineering, and computer science to create strong, reliable, and efficient systems [43]. By linking physical processes and computer control, CPS opens new possibilities for improved human-machine interaction and advanced control mechanisms, showing the ongoing progress and integration of technology in various fields [44].\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS), on the other hand, are a collective term that encompasses various types of control systems and associated instrumentation used for industrial process control [45], [46]. These systems include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), and other configurations such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) [47]\u2013[51]. ICS are integral to the operations of critical infrastructures and industrial sectors such as power generation, water treatment, and manufacturing [52], [53]. They consist of numerous control loops, human-machine interfaces, and remote diagnostics tools, and are built using an array of network protocols to achieve various industrial objectives like manufacturing and transportation of matter or energy [54].\nAn ICS encompasses various control systems and instrumentation used for industrial process control, including SCADA systems, DCS, and PLCs. These systems are designed to manage large-scale, complex industrial processes, ensuring operational efficiency and safety. ICS are often interconnected with corporate and Internet networks, which increases their vulnerability to cyber threats [55]\u2013[58]. Typically, ICS involves numerous field devices such as sensors, actuators, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and PLCs, which interact with physical processes. Additionally, ICS includes supervisory devices like SCADA servers, Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), and engineering workstations, all of which facilitate the management and operation of industrial processes [59], [60]. The architecture of ICS is often based on the Purdue Model, which divides the network into logical segments with different functionalities, including the Enterprise Zone (IT network), the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the Control Zone (OT network), and the Safety Zone [61], [62].\nOriginally, ICS focused on SCADA and PLC systems, but with technological advancements, they have evolved to incorporate complex computer-based control systems. These systems are now integral in managing processes across various industries such as electricity, water, oil and gas, chemical, transportation, and manufacturing [63], [64]."}, {"title": "B. ICS vs. CPS", "content": "While ICS are focused primarily on the control and automation of industrial processes, CPS represent a broader concept that integrates computation with physical processes. CPS involves a tight coupling between computational elements and physical entities, often through embedded systems and sensors, to monitor and control physical environments. Unlike traditional ICS, CPS encompasses a wider range of applications beyond industrial control, including smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and smart buildings. Both ICS and CPS share the goal of enhancing efficiency and functionality, but CPS extends this integration to more diverse and interconnected domains, creating additional cybersecurity challenges due to its broader scope [54], [65]\u2013[67]. ICS can be considered a subset of CPS, tailored to industrial environments with specific requirements for safety, reliability, and availability. CPS applications extend beyond industrial control to areas such as smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare systems [55], [68]. While both ICS and CPS involve the interaction of physical and digital components, CPS encompasses a wider range of applications and is characterized by more complex interactions between computational and physical elements. The paper's focus on ICS highlights the specific challenges and security considerations in industrial environments, particularly concerning sequence attacks and the need for specialized intrusion detection mechanisms [59]. ICS primarily focuses on the management and control of industrial processes through interconnected devices and systems that operate physical processes, emphasizing real-time operational reliability and safety. CPS, on the other hand, extends beyond traditional ICS by integrating computation, networking, and physical processes more cohesively, often incorporating advanced control strategies and data analytics to optimize performance [61]. CPS extends beyond industrial applications to include areas like smart grids, autonomous automotive systems, medical monitoring, and robotics. While ICSs are a subset of CPS focusing on industrial applications, CPS represents a broader paradigm that combines cyber capabilities with physical processes across diverse fields, emphasizing seamless integration and interaction between the computational and physical elements [63]. In contrast, CPS focuses on seamless integration and coordination between computational and physical elements across various fields, not limited to industrial processes. CPS applications often involve more complex interactions and require sophisticated algorithms to manage the interplay between digital and physical worlds [69]."}, {"title": "III. CPS SECURITY CHALLENGES", "content": "CPS face a wide range of security challenges due to their combination of digital and physical components. These systems, which are used in areas like healthcare, transportation, and critical infrastructure, must handle threats from both cyber and physical domains. The complexity of these systems makes them difficult to protect. To better understand these security issues, we can group them into four themes: system-level vulnerabilities, threats and attack types, security measures and responses, and external factors such as regulations, privacy concerns, and the human element [70]\u2013[91]. This section provides an integrated analysis of these challenges and explores possible solutions."}, {"title": "A. System-Level Vulnerabilities and Constraints", "content": "CPS face significant system-level vulnerabilities that stem from the resource limitations of their components, the cross-domain complexity of their architecture, and the continued use of legacy systems. Devices in CPS environments, such as sensors and actuators, often have constrained computational power, memory, and energy resources, making it difficult to implement standard security mechanisms like encryption and intrusion detection [92]\u2013[94]. These constraints are further compounded by the need for CPS to operate continuously without downtime, particularly in sectors where real-time operation is critical, such as healthcare and ICS [94], [95]. As a result, these systems cannot afford delays due to complex security updates or processes. To tackle these limitations, lightweight security solutions such as elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and efficient anomaly detection techniques are increasingly adopted to balance the need for security with performance demands [92], [93].\nThe cross-domain nature of CPS adds another layer of complexity to their security. Unlike traditional IT systems, CPS integrate both physical components such as machines, robots, and sensors with cyber elements, including networks and software [96]. This tight coupling of the physical and cyber domains creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers in multiple ways [93], [95]. Attacks on CPS can target either the digital or the physical components; for instance, cyberattacks can manipulate sensor readings, while physical attacks can directly affect actuators or other hardware. Such attacks can lead to not only data breaches but also physical damage or significant threats to human safety [92], [93], [97].\nLegacy systems pose additional challenges. Many CPS environments, particularly in critical infrastructure like power generation and healthcare, rely on legacy hardware and outdated protocols that were not designed with modern cybersecurity threats in mind [97], [98]. Updating or replacing these systems is often cost-prohibitive and operationally risky, leading to continued reliance on technology that lacks essential security capabilities. To mitigate the risks associated with these legacy systems, practices such as network segmentation and virtual patching are often used to create temporary security barriers [97], [98].\nThe interconnectedness and scale of CPS also lead to challenges related to scalability and cascading effects. In large scale CPS networks such as smart cities or extensive industrial operations thousands of devices are interconnected, increasing the attack surface. If a single vulnerable component is compromised, it can trigger cascading failures that affect the entire system [94], [99]. For instance, a compromised sensor in a power grid could lead to widespread blackouts, as was observed in the 2003 Northeast blackout, where a failure in a single monitoring tool had far-reaching consequences [100], [101]. Hierarchical security management, where local control points are established to manage smaller segments of the network, is one approach that can help mitigate these risks by isolating failures and reducing overall system vulnerability [100], [101]."}, {"title": "B. Threats and Attack Vectors", "content": "CPS are exposed to a broad spectrum of threats, from traditional cyberattacks to physical sabotage, due to the diverse ways in which these systems operate and interact. One of the critical security challenges lies in the range and diversity of potential attack vectors. Digital attacks, such as malware, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and advanced persistent threats (APTs), can manipulate data or disrupt system operations [92], [93], [97], [102]. Meanwhile, physical threats such as tampering with sensors or other hardware can compromise the integrity of the physical components of the system [92], [93]. This dual nature of threats makes CPS security inherently more complex compared to traditional IT systems.\nAdvanced threats, such as zero-day vulnerabilities, present a particularly serious risk to CPS because these vulnerabilities are often unknown to developers and security professionals [103], allowing attackers to exploit them before they are patched [93], [94], [100]. Moreover, attackers are increasingly leveraging AI to identify vulnerabilities or automate coordinated attacks, further complicating defense mechanisms. Such attacks are difficult to detect because they may bypass conventional security measures, leading to potentially catastrophic outcomes, especially in critical systems like autonomous vehicles or industrial automation [93], [94]."}, {"title": "C. Security Measures and Responses", "content": "Effective CPS security demands a comprehensive approach that integrates multiple protective measures across both the cyber and physical domains. Traditional security tools, such as firewalls and network-based intrusion detection systems, are insufficient on their own, as CPS require defenses that span both digital data flows and physical operations [92], [106]. An emerging approach to enhance CPS security involves using hybrid intrusion detection systems that combine machine learning-based anomaly detection with traditional signature-based techniques. These hybrid systems are particularly effective at identifying both known and emerging threats, providing a more holistic defense against complex attack scenarios [92], [106].\nAnother essential aspect of securing CPS is ensuring resilience in the face of attacks. CPS must be capable of detecting and isolating security breaches swiftly while continuing to operate without causing harm [101], [106]. For example, in a smart grid, if one segment is compromised, other parts of the grid must maintain functionality to prevent a large-scale blackout. Resilience can be built into CPS through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and segmentation, allowing the system to withstand localized attacks without experiencing total failure [101], [106]."}, {"title": "D. Regulatory, Privacy, and Human Factors", "content": "Beyond the technical challenges, CPS security is also influenced by regulatory, privacy, and human factors. The regulatory landscape for CPS is fragmented, with some sectors, such as electric power, adopting rigorous standards like the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) guidelines, while others lack comprehensive regulations [92], [98], [107]. This inconsistency creates gaps in the security posture of different CPS sectors. Developing a unified international regulatory framework drawing on models like ISO/IEC 27001 but tailored for CPS environments could help establish a standardized level of security across industries.\nData integrity and privacy are also critical concerns. CPS often collect significant amounts of sensitive data, especially in applications like healthcare and smart cities [94], [95], [99]. Ensuring this data remains secure from unauthorized access is crucial to preventing attackers from manipulating system behavior. At the same time, privacy must be maintained, particularly where personal user data is involved. Designers need to strike a delicate balance between functionality and privacy by integrating privacy-by-design principles into CPS development [94], [95]."}, {"title": "IV. ANOMALY DETECTION", "content": "Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in CPS as it helps identify irregular behaviors that deviate from the system's normal operations. Anomalies can often be a result of malicious attacks targeting the system, and these deviations from the expected behavior can have significant consequences. In the context of CPS, an anomaly can potentially lead to system failures, financial losses, and even endanger human lives. Therefore, ensuring the safety and security of CPS by effectively detecting and addressing anomalies is vital for the system's stability and reliability.\nDefinition 1: Anomalies in CPS are deviations from normal operational behavior that may indicate security threats, system malfunctions, or faults. These deviations can take various forms, including unexpected changes in sensor readings, unusual network traffic patterns, irregular actuator behavior, deviations in control commands, unauthorized access attempts, and anomalous packet structures [115], [116]. Anomalies can broadly be categorized into two types: attacks and faults. Attacks encompass various malicious activities such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, packet injection, unauthorized protocol use, and dictionary attacks targeting web interfaces [33], [117].

Detecting these anomalies is important due to the integration of heterogeneous technologies and the interaction between cyber and physical components in CPS [13]. The challenge lies in identifying these deviations amidst the complex and dynamic nature of these systems. Anomalies can signal a range of issues, from benign system errors to sophisticated cyberattacks, making their timely detection essential for maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of CPS [34], [118].\nThe IoT is an important part of CPS, though many people mistakenly use the two terms as if they are the same. In fact, IoT is a type of CPS. Both involve physical devices connected to computers, but IoT specifically refers to devices that are linked together and share data over a network. Just like CPS, IoT systems can experience anomalies, which are unusual behaviors caused by things like system errors or even attacks. Some researchers focus on finding and fixing these anomalies in IoT systems to keep them safe and working properly.\nIn recent years, many research papers have introduced new methods for detecting anomalies in CPS. These methods are diverse, and each paper presents a different approach. For this survey, we have chosen the most important papers in the field. Although each paper uses a unique method, we have classified them into a few main groups.\nSome papers use machine learning techniques, which rely"}, {"title": "A. Machine Learning Approaches for Anomaly Detection", "content": "Anomaly detection in CPS using machine learning follows several important steps to ensure unusual behaviors are detected accurately. These steps generally involve gathering data, cleaning it, selecting key features, choosing the best machine learning models, and finally testing the models to make sure they can reliably detect anomalies. Each stage is designed to handle the large volumes of data generated by CPS and helps to detect problems early.\n1) Data Collection and Preprocessing: The first step in machine learning-based anomaly detection is data collection. This involves gathering data from various CPS components like sensors, logs, or network traffic. For instance, in an energy grid, data might be collected from transformers, power lines, and smart meters to ensure all critical parts of the system are monitored. Having access to this data makes it possible to detect early signs of malfunction or attack, which is crucial for preventing system failures [119].\nIn IoT networks, large volumes of data are gathered from interconnected devices such as sensors, cameras, or smart home systems. This data includes network traffic, device activity logs, and sensor readings, all of which are critical for detecting potential security threats. Real-time data collection helps establish a baseline for normal operations, which is essential for distinguishing between typical behaviors and suspicious activities [120].\nIn many studies, a systematic approach has been used to detect anomalies in CPS using machine learning techniques. The process begins with a clear definition of potential attack scenarios that could threaten the integrity of CPS, particularly focusing on a water treatment facility. They categorize ten distinct types of attacks, such as inflow manipulations, outflow disruptions, and tank level alterations, each designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities within the system. For instance, one attack scenario involves changing the inflow sensor reading to zero, thereby misleading the system into thinking that no water is entering the facility [121].\nFollowing the generation of training data, the authors proceed to preprocess the data by normalizing sensor readings to ensure consistency across the dataset. They label the data according to whether the system's state is normal or indicative of an attack, facilitating the application of supervised machine learning techniques.\nAfter collecting the data, preprocessing is performed to clean and prepare the data for analysis. This might involve dealing with missing data, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a common format. Techniques like mean imputation are used to fill missing values, while outliers that could distort the results are removed. For instance, in IoT systems, preprocessing might include converting different types of sensor data into numerical formats to standardize them [120], [122]. Additionally, dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are often applied to simplify the dataset while keeping the most critical information [119].\n2) Feature Engineering and Time Series Analysis: Once the data is clean, feature engineering is used to extract key information from the raw data. In CPS, time-series analysis is particularly important since the systems continuously generate data over time. For example, in smart grids, features like average power consumption or voltage spikes over time help distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior [119], [123]. Domain-specific knowledge plays a big role here, as it helps to create features that are especially useful for the system in question.\nIn ICS, a method combines machine learning and fuzzy logic to detect anomalies. Fuzzy logic helps reduce false alarms by evaluating how severe the anomaly is, ensuring that important issues are flagged while less critical ones are minimized [124].\n3) Model Selection: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning: Choosing the right machine learning model is essential. If there are labeled datasets available (i.e., when normal and abnormal behaviors are known), supervised models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests are commonly used. These models learn from the labeled data and can effectively classify new data as normal or anomalous [122].\nIn IoT networks, Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms are widely applied for supervised anomaly detection. These models rely on labeled datasets to differentiate between normal and abnormal behaviors in real-time, ensuring quick detection of anomalies such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or unauthorized access [120].\nThe training phase in the aforementioned CPS attack detection study involves feeding the labeled dataset into nine different classifiers, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Decision Trees, and Bayesian Networks. These classifiers are trained to detect specific types of attacks, such as inflow manipulation or tank level alteration, by learning the behaviors associated with normal and attack states [121].\nHowever, in cases where labeled data is limited, unsupervised learning techniques are used. These models, such as K-Means clustering or Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), can detect anomalies without predefined labels by identifying outliers based on patterns in the data. For example, in smart grids, unsupervised models can help detect irregularities in real-time sensor readings, signaling potential system faults [123].\nSemi-supervised learning is applied when datasets contain a mix of labeled and unlabeled data. Techniques such as self-training or consistency regularization can enhance anomaly detection in complex environments where obtaining labels for all anomalies is challenging [119].\n4) Handling Imbalanced Datasets: An important challenge in CPS is the imbalance between normal data and rare anomalies. Traditional models may fail to detect rare but critical anomalies because they are too focused on the more common normal data. The Causality-Guided Counterfactual Debiasing Framework (CDF) addresses this by using causal graphs to identify and remove bias in model predictions, making anomaly detection more accurate [125].\n5) Real-Time Detection and Evaluation: Once trained, machine learning models are evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC-ROC) to assess how well they detect anomalies while minimizing false positives. This step ensures the model works reliably before being deployed for real-time monitoring.\nFor example, logistic regression models have been used to detect faults in smart grids by monitoring data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). This real-time detection helps prevent large-scale failures in power systems by identifying issues early on [123]. Similarly, Random Forest models have been deployed in IoT systems to detect cyberattacks in real-time using a fog computing architecture, which allows for faster anomaly detection [122], [126].\nIn Cyber Manufacturing Systems (CMS), machine learning models have been used to detect anomalies in data such as acoustic signals and images collected from machines like 3D printers and CNC mills. These models analyze deviations from normal patterns in physical data, allowing for real-time detection of cyberattacks or system malfunctions [127].\nThe models used in the aforementioned CPS attack detection study are deployed for continuous monitoring. Incoming data from sensors and actuators is analyzed in real-time, with significant deviations from normal behavior flagged as potential attacks. Additionally, the classifiers can classify the type of attack, allowing for a more targeted response to the detected threats [121].\n6) Improving Robustness: To ensure machine learning models are reliable, they are tested under both normal and adverse conditions, such as noisy data or deliberate cyberattacks. For instance, in safety-critical CPS such as Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS), adding domain knowledge has been shown to reduce robustness errors by up to 54.2%. This makes the models more reliable in detecting anomalies, even when the input data is slightly distorted [128].\nBy combining machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge and rigorous evaluation, these methods offer a reliable approach to safeguarding CPS. Whether applied in smart grids, IoT systems, or industrial settings, machine learning enhances real-time anomaly detection, improving the security and resilience of CPS."}, {"title": "B. Deep Learning Approaches for Anomaly Detection", "content": "Deep learning techniques have revolutionized anomaly detection in CPS by offering sophisticated methods to analyze complex, multivariate time series data. These approaches excel at capturing intricate temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling the detection of both known and novel anomalies.\n1) Temporal and Spatial Modeling: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have emerged as powerful tools for modeling the temporal aspects of CPS data. LSTMs are effective due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies, making them well-suited for systems where current behavior is influenced by historical states [129] [33]. For example, in ICS monitoring water treatment plants, LSTM models can predict future water-level readings based on past sensor data, flagging significant deviations as potential anomalies [33].\nBuilding upon this foundation, [130] proposed a Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) combined with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), enhancing the model's capacity to detect subtle anomalies by considering both past and future contexts. Autoencoders have gained prominence in CPS anomaly detection due to their ability to learn compact representations of normal data. The MTS-DVGAN model [131] combines deep generative models with contrastive learning, using an LSTM-based encoder to learn latent representations of multivariate time series data. This approach employs reconstruction loss and discrimination loss to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between normal and anomalous samples in the latent space.\nThe RmsAnomaly model [132] further advances autoencoder applications by using convolutional autoencoders to capture both temporal dependencies and inter-sensor correlations. This model constructs signature matrices and uses multi-scale windows to analyze different time scales, calculating an anomaly score based on the difference between original and reconstructed data.\n2) Advanced Architectures and Methodologies: To address the challenges of real-time anomaly detection in large-scale CPS, decentralized approaches have been developed. [133] proposed a methodology using 1D Convolutional Autoencoders (1D-ConvAE) deployed directly on individual CPS components. This approach allows each component to independently monitor its own data, reducing reliance on centralized systems and enabling faster detection and response to anomalies.\nCNNs have shown particular efficacy in analyzing network traffic for IoT anomaly detection. [134] proposed a method utilizing CNN1D, CNN2D, and CNN3D architectures to handle various input data types, demonstrating high accuracy in detecting diverse attack types.\nFor systems with more complex interconnections, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a natural framework for modeling device relationships. [135] presented a GNN-based method that represents IIoT devices as nodes in a graph, excelling in detecting point, contextual, and collective anomalies.\n3) Enhanced Security and Robustness: To improve the security and reliability of autoencoder-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), [136] introduced a method using multipath neural networks. This approach continuously monitors and authenticates the performance of autoencoders, analyzing reconstruction errors to detect anomalies and potential spoofing attacks. The use of a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test enhances the system's ability to detect subtle changes and gradual attacks.\nIn the context of IoT networks, [137] proposed a comprehensive process using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to identify malicious activity in network traffic. This approach involves capturing network traffic, extracting and preprocessing relevant features, and training a DNN model to classify traffic as benign or anomalous. The use of mutual information (MI) for feature selection helps minimize complexity while maintaining high detection accuracy.\n4) Context-Aware and Zone-Based Approaches: Context-aware approaches have been developed to improve the accuracy and interpretability of anomaly detection in CPS. The ABATe methodology [138] uses neural networks to generate context vectors that encode relationships between different system states. This approach is effective in detecting both point anomalies and contextual anomalies, and is adaptable across various CPS domains.\nFor industrial CPS, zone-based approaches offer robust and redundant anomaly detection. [139] proposed a method that divides the physical system into multiple zones, each monitored by a neural network model. Anomalies are detected by cross-referencing data between zones, using tendency and error analysis. This approach is particularly effective in detecting both cyber and physical threats, even when individual zones are compromised.\n5) Hybrid and Adaptive Systems: To address the multifaceted challenges of CPS anomaly detection, researchers have developed sophisticated hybrid architectures:\n\u2022\nThe ATTAIN system [140] integrates a digital twin model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), allowing the digital twin to provide ground truth labels while the GAN enhances detection through adversarial learning.\n\u2022\nThe Adaptive-Correlation-Aware Unsupervised Deep Learning (ACUDL) model [141] employs a dynamic graph update mechanism in conjunction with a Dual-Autoencoder (D-AE), adapting to evolving system dynamics.\n\u2022\nTo address the challenge of limited labeled data, [142] proposed a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network, enabling the identification of novel anomalies with minimal labeled examples.\nThese advanced deep learning techniques offer robust frameworks for processing vast amounts of multivariate time series data and identifying subtle deviations that may indicate threats or system failures. As CPS continue to grow in complexity and face evolving challenges, deep learning-based anomaly detection plays an increasingly crucial role in safeguarding these critical systems."}, {"title": "C.

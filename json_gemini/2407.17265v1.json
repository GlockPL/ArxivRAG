Imaging biomarkers obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can predict the functional recovery of individuals with SCI and help choose the optimal treatment strategy. Currently, most studies employ manual quantification of these MRI-derived biomarkers, which is a subjective and tedious task. In this work, we propose (i) a universal tool for the automatic segmentation of intramedullary SCI lesions, dubbed SCIsegV2, and (ii) a method to automatically compute the width of the tissue bridges from the segmented lesion. Tissue bridges represent the spared spinal tissue adjacent to the lesion, which is associated with functional recovery in SCI patients. The tool was trained and validated on a heterogeneous dataset from 7 sites comprising patients from different SCI phases (acute, sub-acute, and chronic) and etiologies (traumatic SCI, ischemic SCI, and degenerative cervical myelopathy). Tissue bridges quantified automatically did not significantly differ from those computed manually, suggesting that the proposed automatic tool can be used to derive relevant MRI biomarkers. SCIsegV2 and the automatic tissue bridges computation are open-source and available in Spinal Cord Toolbox (v6.4 and above) via the sct_deepseg -task seg_sc_lesion_t2w_sci and sct_analyze_lesion functions, respectively.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) represent damage to the spinal cord (SC) with severe consequences, including weakness and paralysis in patients [4]. Traumatic SCI arises from sudden physical impacts, such as car accidents or falls, while non-traumatic SCI can be caused by ischemia (ischemic SCI) or chronic mechanical compression of the SC (degenerative cervical myelopathy, DCM) [4,1]. Both traumatic and non-traumatic SCI commonly involve intramedullary lesions, which are critical areas of tissue damage within the SC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used to provide information on the extent and the location of these intramedullary lesions [4,5,22]. Importantly, MRI scans can also be used to compute quantitative biomarkers, such as midsagittal tissue bridges [8]. These help in quantifying the amount of preserved SC neural tissue (carrying motor and sensory information to and from the brain) and have been found to predict functional recovery in patients with traumatic and non-traumatic SCI [8,16,17,20,23,18]."}, {"title": "2 Materials and Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Dataset", "content": "We used T2-weighted (T2w) MRI images with heterogeneous image resolutions (isotropic, sagittal, and axial) and magnetic field strengths (1.0T, 1.5T, and 3.0T) from seven sites. The number of patients from each site is as follows: {site 1: (n = 154), site 2: (n = 80), site 3: (n = 14), site 4: (n = 11), site 5: (n = 23), site 6: (n = 4), site 7: (n = 5)}. Site 1 contained patients with both traumatic (n = 97) and non-traumatic SCI (mainly, DCM) (n = 57). Sites 2 & 3 included both preoperative and postoperative traumatic SCI, while sites 4 to 7 included only acute preoperative traumatic SCI. The timing of the MRI examination in relation to injury for traumatic SCI patients from sites 1, 2, and 3 is detailed in Table 1 of [14]. Eight patients from site 1 were followed up with additional MRI examinations, and 40 patients from site 1 had both sagittal and axial T2w images. Patients from sites 1 & 2 were split according to 80-20% train/test ratio. Due to the relatively small size of some datasets, we decided to use sites 3, 5 & 6 entirely for training and kept the patients from sites 4 & 7 as held-out (unseen) test sets to evaluate the model's generalization performance. The model was trained on a total of 281 T2w images and tested on 75 images. The ground truth masks of intramedullary lesions appearing as T2w signal abnormalities were manually annotated by expert raters at individual sites [14]. The SC masks were automatically segmented using the sct_deepseg_sc [6] algorithm and manually corrected when necessary."}, {"title": "2.2 SCIsegV2", "content": "We used nnUNet [10] as the backbone architecture for the SCI lesion segmentation model. The continuing dominance of nnUNet [10,9] across several open-source challenges has shown that a well-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is robust and continues to achieve state-of-the-art results over novel (and more sophisticated) transformer-based architectures in dense pixel prediction tasks such as image segmentation.\nSimilar to the recent work building upon the nnUNet framework [21,11], we experimented with its easy-to-tweak trainers for developing SCIsegV2. Specifically, we used: (i) nnUNetTrainer, the default model, and (ii) nnUNetTrainerDA5, the model applying aggressive data augmentation.

The midsagittal slice is defined as the middle slice of all slices where the SC is visible (Figure 2B). Ventral and dorsal tissue bridges are quantified as the width of spared tissue at the minimum distance from the intramedullary lesion edge to the boundary between the SC and cerebrospinal fluid (Figure 2C).\nTo automate the measurement of tissue bridges, we propose a method that computes ventral and dorsal tissue bridges utilizing the lesion and SC segmentation masks. To compensate for different neck positions and, consequently, different SC curvatures, we use angle correction, which adjusts the tissue bridge widths with respect to the SC centerline [7]. The method computes tissue bridges from all sagittal slices containing the lesion, allowing quantification of not only midsagittal but parasagittal tissue bridges as well. For the purpose of this study (and to compare against existing manual measurements based on midsagittal tissue bridges), we considered only the midsagittal slice for the automatic measurement of the tissue bridges."}, {"title": "2.4 Experiments", "content": "We divided our experiments into 3 categories to investigate the effects of input types, data augmentation strategies and SCI etiology-specific models. All images were preprocessed with right-left, posterior-anterior, inferior-superior (RPI) orientation, resampled to a common resolution (0.92 \u00d7 0.68 \u00d7 0.92 mm\u00b3, which is the median of all image resolutions in the training set) and intensity-normalized using Z-score normalization. The model was trained for 1000 epochs with 5-fold cross-validation, using a batch size of 2 and the stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a polynomial learning rate scheduler.\nInputs We trained 2 different models: (i) a model that segments both the SC and lesions given just the T2w image as input (referred to as single), and (ii) a model that segments only the lesion given a 2-channel input consisting of T2w image and the SC segmentation (referred to as multi). As briefly discussed in Section 2.2, this experiment is to understand whether providing additional (localization) context in the form of SC segmentation as input would improve the lesion segmentation performance.\nData augmentation Given the increasing literature towards unrealistic transformations leading to better test-time performance [2], we compared 2 models with and without aggressive data augmentation to understand which model leads to better generalization on external test sets with acute preoperative SCI images. These are referred to as defaultDA and aggressiveDA, respectively.\nSCI Etiology-specific models This crucial experiment will provide insight into the initial hypothesis, asking whether a comprehensive SCI model is achievable. Toward this end, we compared our SCIsegV2 model trained on all 7 sites against etiology-specific models individually trained on non-traumatic SCI and acute preoperative SCI data, respectively."}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "Figure 3 shows the test Dice scores averaged across 5 folds for all models described in Section 2.4. Starting with the etiology-specific models, we observed that the model trained only on acute preoperative (AcuteSCI) data does not perform well on sites 1 and 2 containing non-traumatic and traumatic SCI data. While it performs relatively better on test sets from unseen sites (sites 4 and 7), it does not outperform the SCIsegV2 models. Likewise, the model trained only on non-traumatic SCI data (DCM) performs well on a similar test set but fails in generalizing to acute preoperative SCI of sites 4 and 7.\nSince SCIsegV1 [14] was trained on a dataset of 3 sites predominantly consisting of traumatic SCI, it outperforms SCIsegV2 models in sites 1 and 2. However, we observed that even SCIsegV1 performs poorly on sites 4 and 7 suggesting that the segmentation of acute preoperative SCI lesions is extremely challenging.\nWithin SCIsegV2 models, we noted that training with aggressive data augmentation only results in marginal improvements in lesion segmentation performance. However, concatenating the SC segmentation as a second channel along with the input image (resulting in a 2-channel input) showed considerable improvements, especially in acute preoperative images, compared to a single-channel input with just the T2w image.\nIn Table 1, we present a quantitative comparison of different models using lesion-wise metrics. We noticed that the models' performance depends heavily on the specific SCI phases and etiologies. Except for site 1 (traumatic SCI), SCIsegV2 outperforms SCIsegV1 in all other sites. Comparing within the SCIsegV2"}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "In this work, we proposed SCIsegV2, a DL-based universal tool for the segmentation of intramedullary lesions across different SCI etiologies and phases. We also automated the calculation of midsagittal tissue bridges, a metric representing spared spinal tissue adjacent to the lesion. This metric is relevant as it is associated with functional recovery in individuals with SCI. Both SCIsegV2 and the automatic tissue bridges computation are open-source and available in Spinal Cord Toolbox (v6.4 and above) via the sct_deepseg -task seg_sc_lesion_t2w_sci and sct_analyze_lesion functions, respectively.\nThe heterogeneity in the appearance of intramedullary lesions across different SCI phases (acute, sub-acute, chronic) and etiologies (traumatic SCI, ischemic SCI, DCM) makes lesion segmentation extremely challenging, even for trained radiologists. Relatively low prevalence of traumatic SCI and the need for early surgical intervention [1] result in a low number of preoperative MRI scans, which adds to the difficulty in training a robust automatic segmentation model, that performs well on \"real world\" clinical data across multiple sites. Moreover, MRI scans of individuals with chronic SCI frequently exhibit image distortions caused by metallic implants, further complicating the segmentation process.\nAs a way of simplifying the lesion segmentation problem, using the SC mask to explicitly guide the model towards the cord showed improved results on certain etiologies. However, it introduced a dependency on the SC mask to be concatenated to the input image, preventing a smooth transition from the model's automatic predictions to the computation of tissue bridges, which requires both the cord and lesion masks. In contrast, the SCIsegV2_single model capable of segmenting both SC and lesions has a higher utility as it is also applicable in scenarios where SC masks are unavailable. Lastly, as the lesion appearance varies substantially across different SCI types, universal models like SCIsegV2 learn the differences in lesion distributions across etiologies and even outperform etiology-specific models while showing good generalization across sites.\nLimitations and Future Work One limitation of the model is its higher sensitivity to traumatic SCI lesions, as approximately (~ 70%) of our dataset consists of this population. This skew is due to the relatively low availability of acute preoperative SCI scans. Acquiring additional data in SCI is generally challenging, but is possible with the help of ongoing clinical trials and consortiums for creating large databases for SCI research [15,3]. While this work used a relatively small and unbalanced cohort, we presented a preliminary proof-of-concept toward a universal tool for SCI lesion segmentation. The current literature only quantifies tissue bridges manually, from a single midsagittal slice. However, as lesions are 3D blob-like objects, the midsagittal slice might not necessarily contain the largest portions of the lesion and does not consider parasagittally running fiber tracts. Therefore, combining both parasagittal and midsagittal slices could provide a comprehensive evaluation of the width of the spared tissue bridges.\nProspect of application Automatic segmentation of the lesions and spinal cord could mitigate the bottleneck and inter-rater variability associated with manual annotations. Automating the measurements of tissue bridges could provide an objective, unbiased way in guiding rehabilitation decision making and stratifying patients into homogeneous subgroups of recovery in clinical trials."}]}

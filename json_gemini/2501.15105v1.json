{"title": "A New Approach for Knowledge Generation Using Active Inference", "authors": ["Jamshid Ghasimia", "Nazanin Movarraeib"], "abstract": "There are various models proposed on how knowledge is generated in the human brain including the semantic networks model. Although this model has been widely studied and even computational models are presented, but, due to various limits and inefficiencies in the generation of different types of knowledge, its application is limited to semantic knowledge because of has been formed according to semantic memory and declarative knowledge and has many limits in explaining various procedural and conditional knowledge. Given the importance of providing an appropriate model for knowledge generation, especially in the areas of improving human cognitive functions or building intelligent machines, improving existing models in knowledge generation or providing more comprehensive models is of great importance. In the current study, based on the free energy principle of the brain, is the researchers proposed a model for generating three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge. While explaining different types of knowledge, this model is capable to compute and generate concepts from stimuli based on probabilistic mathematics and the action-perception process (active inference). The proposed model is unsupervised learning that can update itself using a combination of different stimuli as a generative model can generate new concepts of unsupervised received stimuli. In this model, the active inference process is used in the generation of procedural and conditional knowledge and the perception process is used to generate declarative knowledge.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "How knowledge is generated in the human brain is very important because of its effect on the study of cognitive features and functions such as problem-solving, judgment, or decision making [38, 30, 26].

Perception of concepts, and their stimuli and the relationship between different concepts based on the commonalities in their stimuli form declarative knowledge. Stimuli, because of the features of concepts, generate new concepts that are then stored in memory. It should be noted that in semantic memory, the meaning of a concept is preserved and not the word itself or the grammatical features of a conceptual sentence. Concepts are generated through their stimuli. In other words, concepts are hidden variables in the environment that can be discovered or inferred through stimuli.\nIn addition, declarative knowledge can be presented orally (linguistically) and in writing. In this case, declarative knowledge is generated by information that is constructed as a hierarchy in the semantic memory and the form of a network consisting of concepts and their relationships (semantic networks) [31].\nEach concept could have several stimuli. The stimuli of each concept can be varied and abundant, which depending on the observer may differ in quality and number, however, most concepts and"}, {"title": "The relationship between concepts and stimuli", "content": "In an interaction between man and the environment and the connection between the two, each concept is shaped by its stimuli.

This process can be extended to the model of knowledge generation. In addition to declarative knowledge, it also includes procedural and conditional knowledge.\nFigure 3 shows two different loops I and II. Loop I includes prediction, perception, and brain error. If the inference is passive (environment is not affected by agent), loop I is the brain's only func-tional process on sensory stimuli. The prediction error changes the predictions through perception, resulting in a change in the brain's internal coding and updating. Thus, if there is no action to change the sensory inputs, Bayesian-type learning and inference is done by updating previous prob-abilities (previous beliefs) concerning receiving new sensory stimuli. This process is similar to the computational model of updating semantic networks in the generation of declarative knowledge. The learning in the FEP of the brain means detecting and reducing the prediction error in loop I [19, 48].

In semantic networks and the process of data transfer through stimuli to humans, the generation of concepts (meaning) is done by energy minimizing (Equation 1), and in the FEP of the brain, it is done by minimizing variable free energy which is depen-dent on human perception and action ( Equations 9). The comparison of these two approaches in knowledge generation is as follows:\nIn the semantic network model, the inference is based on Bayesian probabilities and inferences, while in the FEP model, the inferences are based on the Bayesian variability and happen in the perception-action process.\nIn the semantic network model, only the declarative knowledge is generated, but in the FEP model, all three types of declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge are generated.\nBoth models act as generative model to generate concepts of stimuli.\nUpdating it over time is possible in both models.\nIn the model of semantic networks, to separate concepts, the combination of stimuli is used to generate concepts, while the FEP uses the difference between prediction and sensory perceptions and the effect of the factor on sensory stimuli.\nBoth models correspond to the characteristics of a Markov model in the process of learning and inference.\nElimination of loop II in the FEP (Figure 3) eliminates the generation of procedural knowledge and active inference and turns it into a declarative knowledge generation model similar to the semantic network model.\n- Perception is an important part of the FEP model in such a way that, while the semantic networks and free energy of information transmission models does not have such possibility, a computational model can be presented for human perception when receiving sensory stimuli.\nThe semantic relationship between concepts in the model of semantic networks is determined based on the matrix of similarity or Euclidean distance of concepts [11, 41]"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This article examined how knowledge is generated in the brain and proposed a model for it. The model of semantic networks is widely considered in the generation of declarative knowledge, but it is not possible to explain in detail the process of procedural and conditional knowledge genera-tion. By classifying it into two loops of declarative knowledge generator and procedural knowledge generator, a model was proposed for generating different types of knowledge using the FEP model of the brain, which shows the ability to learn concepts in the human brain. This model, while calculating the method of generating different types of knowledge in the brain, can be very flexible in updating the model and generating concepts of sensory stimuli in a perceptual-action process. In the continuation of this research, while addressing sensory stimuli that are involved in the process of generating concepts, semantic or abstract stimuli can also be considered in the brain, which can generate new concepts without sensory stimuli. The application of this model can be examined in specific examples, such as knowledge generation in intelligent machines. Also, in the case of cognitive diseases, especially Alzheimer's, probability it is possible to control the disease based on the process of producing semantic or procedural knowledge."}], "latex": ["\\Omega(\\lambda) = \u2212\\lambda I(S, R) + (1 \u2212 \\lambda)H(S)", "\\Omega_o = I(S, R)", "I(S, R) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^m p(S_i, r_j) log\\frac{p(s_i,r_j)}{p(s_i)p(r_j)}", "I(S, R) = D_{KL}(P(s_i,r_j)||p(s_i)p(r_j))", "\\begin{cases} \\Omega(\\lambda)/\\lambda = -D_{KL}(p(s_{i, r_j})||p(s_i)p(r_j)) + \\alpha\\pi(H(S)) \\\\ \\alpha\\pi = 1 \u2212 1\\\\ , 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 n \u2264 \u221e \\end{cases}", "S_i \\ (A_{i1}, A_{i2}, \u2026, A_{im})", "cos \\beta_{ij} \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^m a_{ik}a_{jk}}{||s_i||||s_j||} \\frac{S_iS_j}{\\sqrt{||s_i||||s_j||}}", "H(\\varphi) = - \\int p(x|m)lnp(p|m)dy \\\\ = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T  -lnp(\\varphi|m)dt", "\\begin{cases}  F = Divergence + Surprise = D_{KL}[q(\\theta|\\mu)||p(\\theta|\\varphi)] \u2013 lnp(\\varphi) \\\\  \\mu = arg min Divergence \\\\  F = Complexity \u2013 Accuracy = D_{KL}(q||p(\\theta))\u2212 < lnp(\\varphi(a)|\\theta, m) > \\\\ a = arg max Accuracy \\end{cases}", "p(\\theta, \\varphi) = p(\\theta|\\varphi)p(\\varphi) = p(\\varphi|\\theta)p(\\theta)", "p(\\varphi, \\theta, \\pi) = p(\\varphi|\\theta)p(\\pi) \\prod_t [p(\\theta_{t+1}|\\theta_t, \\pi) \\rho(\\varphi_t|\\theta_t)"]}

A particularly significant branch of NLP is Natural Language Generation (NLG), which focuses on the production of human-like language from structured or unstructured data. NLG's goal is to enable machines to generate coherent, relevant, and context-aware text, improving interactions between humans and machines (Gatt et. al. 2018). As Al evolves, the demand for more contextually aware and factually grounded generated content has increased, bringing about new challenges and innovations in NLG."}, {"title": "1.2 Overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)", "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging hybrid architecture designed to address the limitations of pure generative models. RAG integrates two key components: (i) a retrieval mechanism, which retrieves relevant documents or information from an external knowledge source, and (ii) a generation module, which processes this information to generate human-like text (Lewis et al. 2020). This combination allows RAG models to not only generate fluent text but also ground their outputs in real-world, up-to-date data.\nThe retrieval module in RAG typically leverages dense vector representations to identify relevant documents from large datasets, such as Wikipedia or proprietary databases. Once retrieved, these documents are passed to the generative module, often built using transformer-based architectures, to generate responses grounded in the retrieved knowledge. This methodology helps mitigate the hallucination problem and ensures that the generated text is more factual and contextually appropriate (Thakur et al. 2021). Over the period, RAG models have seen applications in various domains, including open-domain question answering (Karpukhin et al., 2020), conversational agents (Liu et al. 2021), and personalized recommendations."}, {"title": "1.3 Evolution of Hybrid Models in NLP", "content": "Before the introduction of RAG, NLP models primarily relied on either retrieval or generation approaches, each with its own set of advantages and limitations. Retrieval-based systems, such as traditional information retrieval engines (Salton et al., 1975), efficiently provided relevant documents or snippets in response to a query but could not synthesize new information or present the results in a coherent narrative. On the other hand, purely generative models, which became popular with the rise of transformer architectures (Vaswani et al. 2017), offered fluency and creativity but often lacked factual accuracy.\nThe development of hybrid systems combining retrieval and generation began to gain momentum as researchers recognized the complementary strengths of both approaches. Early efforts in hybrid modeling can be traced back to works like DrQA (Chen et al. 2017), which employed retrieval techniques to fetch relevant documents for question-answering tasks. However, the generative component in such systems was minimal, often limited to selecting text directly from the retrieved documents. Similarly, in models like Information Retrieval (Dai et al. 2019), retrieval was treated as distinct, independent components.\nThe real innovation came with the realization that retrieval and generation could be tightly integrated. Models like REALM (Guu et al., 2020) represented a key milestone, as they trained the retrieval and generative components jointly, enabling better alignment between the retrieved information and the generated output. RAG (Lewis et al. 2020) further extended this paradigm by using dense passage retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020) to fetch relevant documents and transformers like BART (Lewis et al., 2020) for a generation. This architecture provided a more seamless integration of retrieval and generation, allowing the model to answer open-ended questions with both fluency and factual grounding."}, {"title": "1.4 Importance of Factually Grounded Language Generation", "content": "One of the main motivations for developing RAG is the increasing demand for factually accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date generated content. In many applications, such as customer service, medical diagnostics, or legal advisory systems, the need for reliable and grounded responses is paramount. Generative models that produce hallucinated or inaccurate information can lead to serious consequences, such as spreading misinformation or providing incorrect advice (Ji et al. 2022)."}, {"title": "1.5 Applications of RAG Models", "content": "RAG models have been applied across a wide array of domains where factual accuracy and contextual understanding are critical. One of the most prominent applications is in open-domain question answering, where the model must generate answers based on a wide range of topics. RAG has proven effective in improving answer accuracy by retrieving relevant information and then generating responses grounded in that data (Izacard et. al. 2021). Models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) (Karpukhin et al., 2020) and Fusion-in-Decoder (Izacard et. al. 2021) have been used to great effect in this context, showing significant improvements over traditional generative or retrieval-only models.\nIn conversational AI, RAG models have enhanced the capabilities of dialogue systems by ensuring that responses are both coherent and grounded in factual information (Roller et al., 2020). For example, chatbots used in customer service can benefit from RAG's ability to retrieve specific details from product databases or documentation, leading to more accurate and useful responses for end-users.\nOther applications include medical diagnosis systems, where RAG can retrieve and integrate the latest research findings or patient-specific data to generate accurate diagnostic suggestions, and legal advisory systems, where the model can retrieve relevant case law or statutes to provide legally sound advice. Furthermore, RAG has found applications in personalized recommendation systems, where it can retrieve user preferences or past interactions and generate personalized suggestions."}, {"title": "1.6 Challenges and Limitations of RAG", "content": "Despite the promise of RAG models, several challenges need attention. The retrieval mechanism, while powerful, can still struggle with retrieving the most relevant documents, particularly when dealing with ambiguous queries or niche knowledge domains. The reliance on dense vector representations, such as those used in DPR, can sometimes lead to irrelevant or off-topic documents being retrieved. Efforts to refine retrieval techniques, including the incorporation of more sophisticated query expansion and contextual disambiguation, are needed to improve performance in these areas. The integration between retrieval and generation, while seamless in theory, can sometimes fail in practice. For instance, the generative module may not always effectively incorporate the retrieved information into its responses, leading to inconsistencies or incoherence between the retrieved facts and the generated text. Research into better alignment mechanisms, such as improved attention models or hierarchical fusion techniques, may help alleviate these issues (Izacard et. al. 2021). Additionally, the computational overhead of RAG models is a concern, as they require both a retrieval and a generation step for each query. This dual process can be resource-intensive, particularly for large-scale applications (Borgeaud et al. 2021). Techniques such as model pruning (Han et al. 2015) or knowledge distillation (Sanh et al., 2019) may offer ways to reduce the computational burden without sacrificing performance. Finally, there are ethical concerns associated with the deployment of RAG models, particularly in terms of bias and transparency. Biases in Al and LLM have been a well-researched and evolving field with researchers identifying different types of biases not limited to Gender, socio-economic class, or even educational background (Gupta et. al. 2024; Ranjan et. al., 2024). While RAG has the potential to reduce biases by retrieving more balanced information, there is still the risk of amplifying biases present in the retrieved sources"}, {"title": "1.7 Scope of the Survey", "content": "This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of RAG models, covering their evolution, key architectural components, recent research in this area, current challenges and limitations of RAG, and future research direction."}, {"title": "2: Core Components and Architectural Overview of RAG Systems", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Overview of RAG Models", "content": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an advanced hybrid model architecture that augments natural language generation (NLG) with external retrieval mechanisms to enhance the model's knowledge base. Traditional large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and BERT, which are pre-trained on vast corpora, rely entirely on their internal representations of knowledge, making them susceptible to issues like hallucinations\u2014where the models generate plausible but incorrect information. These models cannot efficiently update their knowledge bases without retraining, making them less practical for dynamic, knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering and fact verification (Brown, T., et al. 2020). To overcome these limitations, the paper (Lewis et al. 2020) proposed the RAG architecture, which retrieves real-time, relevant external documents to ground the generated text in factual information.\nThe RAG model incorporates two key components:\n1. Retriever: This retrieves the most relevant documents from a corpus using techniques such as\ndense passage retrieval (DPR) (Karpukhin et. al. 2020) or traditional BM25 algorithms.\n2. Generator: It synthesizes the retrieved documents into coherent, contextually relevant\nresponses.\nRAG's strength lies in its ability to leverage external knowledge dynamically, allowing it to outperform generative models like GPT-3 and knowledge-grounded systems like BERT, which rely on static datasets. In open-domain question answering, RAG has been demonstrated to be highly effective, consistently retrieving relevant information and improving the factual accuracy of the generated responses (Guu, K., et al. 2020). In addition to knowledge retrieval, RAG models excel at updating knowledge bases. Since the model fetches external documents for each query, it requires no retraining to incorporate the latest information. This flexibility makes RAG models particularly suitable for domains where information is constantly evolving, such as medical research, financial news, and legal proceedings. Furthermore, studies have shown that RAG models achieve superior results in a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks, including document summarization and, knowledge-grounded dialogues"}, {"title": "2.2 Retriever Mechanisms in RAG Systems", "content": "The retriever in RAG systems is essential for fetching relevant documents from an external corpus. Effective retrieval ensures that the model's output is grounded in accurate information. Several retrieval mechanisms are commonly used, ranging from traditional methods like BM25 to more sophisticated techniques like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)."}, {"title": "2.2.1 BM25", "content": "BM25 is a well-established information retrieval algorithm that uses the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to rank documents according to relevance. Despite being a classical method, BM25 remains a strong baseline for many modern retrieval systems, including those used in RAG models. BM25 calculates the relevance score of a document based on how frequently a query term appears in the document while adjusting for the document's length and the frequency of the term across the corpus (Robertson et. al. 2009). While BM25 is effective for keyword matching, it has limitations in understanding semantic meaning. For example, BM25 cannot capture the relationships between words and tends to perform poorly on more complex, natural language queries that require an understanding of context. Despite this limitation, BM25 is still widely used because of its simplicity and efficiency. BM25 is effective for tasks involving simpler, keyword-based queries, although more modern retrieval models like DPR tend to outperform it in semantically complex tasks."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)", "content": "Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), introduced by Karpukhin et al. (2020), represents a more modern approach to information retrieval. It uses a dense vector space in which both the query and the documents are encoded into high-dimensional vectors. DPR employs a bi-encoder architecture, where the query and documents are encoded separately, allowing for efficient nearest-neighbor search (Xiong et. al. 2020). Unlike BM25, DPR excels at capturing semantic similarity between the query and documents, making it highly effective for open-domain question-answering tasks. The strength of DPR lies in its ability to retrieve relevant information based on semantic meaning rather than keyword matching. By training the retriever on a large corpus of question-answer pairs, DPR can find documents that are contextually related to the query, even when the query and the document do not share exact terms. Recent research has further improved DPR by integrating it with pre-trained language models and an example is LLM adapted for the dense RetrievAl approach (Li et. al. 2023)"}, {"title": "2.2.3 REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model)", "content": "Another significant advancement in retrieval mechanisms for RAG models is REALM (Guu et al. (2020). REALM integrates retrieval into the language model's pre-training process, ensuring that the retriever is optimized alongside the generator for downstream tasks. The key innovation in REALM is that it learns to retrieve documents that improve the model's performance on specific tasks, such as question answering or document summarization. During training, REALM updates both the retriever and the generator, ensuring that the retrieval process is optimized for the generation task. REALM's retriever is trained to identify documents that are not only relevant to the query but also helpful for generating accurate and coherent responses. As a result, REALM significantly improves the quality of generated responses, particularly in tasks that require external knowledge. Recent studies have demonstrated that REALM outperforms both BM25 and DPR in certain knowledge-intensive tasks, particularly when retrieval is tightly coupled with generation.\nThe core of RAG lies in the quality of retrieved passages, but many current methods rely on similarity-based retrieval (Mallen et al. 2022). Self-RAG (Asai et al. 2023b), and REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) have advanced by leveraging LLMs to enhance retrieval capabilities, achieving more adaptive retrieval. After initial retrieval, cross-encoder models are used to re-rank the retrieved results by jointly encoding the query and each retrieved document to compute relevance scores. These models provide more context-aware retrieval at the cost of higher computational overhead. Pointwise and Pairwise Ranking, often based on Learning-to-Rank (LTR) algorithms, are used to assign relevance scores to"}, {"title": "2.3 Generator Mechanisms in RAG Systems", "content": "In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, the generator mechanism plays a crucial role in producing the final output by integrating retrieved information with the input query.

As a denoising autoencoder, BART can reconstruct corrupted text sequences, making it robust for tasks that require the generation of coherent, factual outputs from incomplete or noisy data. When paired with a retriever in a RAG system, BART has been shown to improve the factual accuracy of generated text by grounding it in external knowledge.

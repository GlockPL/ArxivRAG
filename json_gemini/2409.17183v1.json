Introduction", "content": "The theory of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) [40] has been developed with the aim to\nunderstand how financial market prices change over time; according to EMH, financial markets\nimmediately adjust their prices to the information available [1]. In an efficient market a security's\nprice fully reflects all available information about the intrinsic security value [2]. In such a market the\nsecurities prices are always fair (i.e. correctly incorporate all information available up to the current\ntime) and there aren't mispriced securities; as consequence, in an efficient market it is not possible\nto exploit mispriced securities in order to gain extra returns with respect to the fair returns.\nEMH would requires the presence of only \u201cactive\u201d investors which are able to immediately\nincorporate information into prices; but in an efficient market nobody could gain greater profits -\nthan the index market profits - because of the exclusive presence of fair prices corresponding to the\nintrinsic securities values; in other words, in an efficient market there aren't extra profits to be\ngained because of the absence of mispriced securities; as consequence, in an efficient market there\nis no benefit to be \"active\" investor and the smart investors should only be \"passive\" ones that only\nfollow the \"buy and hold\u201d strategy; but the presence of only \u201cpassive\u201d investors lead to a paradox\nbecause nobody would immediately incorporate information into prices and consequently\nfinancial markets would not be able to immediately adjust their prices to the information available;\nso, the above paradox implies market cannot be efficient, at least in order to let the existence of\nsmart \"active\" investors which should be able to incorporate information into prices; moreover, the\nabove necessary existence of smart \"active\" investors also implies the presence of mispriced\nsecurities and as consequence the existence of the prices predictability by means of the gap\nexploiting between the mispriced securities and the fair prices.\nBecause of the predictability of financial prices, the market prices have to follow a non-random walk;\nobviously, the more efficient is the market, the less predictable are the price changes and as\nconsequence \u2013 the more random are the sequence of price changes generated by such a market [3].\nAccording to Mishkin & Eakins [2], lots of reasons are able to explain the inefficiency of financial\nmarkets: 1) information are not available to all the people in the same moment, 2) different financial\noperators could be in disagree with the information effect on prices and on expected returns; 3)\ntransaction costs and taxes impact in a different manner on different operators; 4) overconfidence\nand social contagion are able to push the prices far from the actual intrinsic value. Accordingly, to\nthe above reasons, literature highlights empirical evidences contrary to the efficiency of financial\nmarkets [1]: volatility surging or bubbles prices are empirical notorious examples [2].\nWith the aim to overcome the limits of EMH, the Adaptative Market Hypothesis (AMH) states that\n<<prices reflect as much information as dictated by the combination of environmental conditions"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "Two approaches [4] have been traditionally used, by the financial traders, for prices prediction:\nfundamental analysis and technical analysis. The fundamental analysis (FA) <<seeks economic\nfactors that have an influence on market trends>> [1] and - in order to get predictions - takes in\nconsideration macroeconomic analysis, industry analysis and company ones[ 4]; so, following a\nthorough examination of the fundamental factors, an investor has the opportunity to purchase a\nstock if the analysis reveals that the stock's fair value exceeds its current market price, indicating an\nundervalued condition. In such a situation, the investor acquires the stock and retains it until the\nmarket price aligns with its intrinsic value. Consequently, the investor realizes a substantial profit by\nselling the stock at its intrinsic market price; likewise, an investor might choose to sell or abstain\nfrom purchasing - an overpriced security.\nFundamental analysis is one of the most effective ways to evaluate investments, as it involves\nexamining every aspect of a company's operations through its balance sheet, past\nperformance, financial reports, market goodwill, management, and consumer behaviour, with the\nfinal aim to define the intrinsic value of the related stock. The analysis usually begins\nfrom macroeconomic factors, such as the economy and industry performance, and goes down to\nmicroeconomic factors like management, strategic initiatives, and business policies. Thus, FA may\nguide investors to manage risks and make informed investing decisions by ascertaining the intrinsic\nvalue of a stock.\nThe technical analysis - highly popular for its potential usefulness with respect to the forecasting of\nthe stock market risk premium [11] - considers <<past and current market price, trading volume and\nother publicly available information to predict future market prices.>> [5], and revolves around the\nmeticulous observation of stock price fluctuations in order to forecast future trends and facilitate\ninvestment decision-making.\nAs the economic fundamentals are not practically able to sensibly impact on the shorter market\ndynamics, the shorter is the horizon, the more used is the technical analysis: <<at short horizons\n(less than a week) traders use technical analysis more frequently than fundamental analysis.>> [6];\non this last regard, a financial trader needs to define a trading strategy - which is constituted by rules"}, {"title": "2.1 Fundamental analysis typologies", "content": "Fundamental analysis encompasses two distinct approaches: qualitative analysis and quantitative\nanalysis. Qualitative analysis focuses on intangible factors such as market conditions, brand\nreputation and overall goodwill. On the other hand, quantitative analysis is predominantly driven by\nstatistical data and numerical metrics\nQualitative analysis entails examining various aspects of a company's operations, including its\nmarket reputation, consumer behaviour, demand dynamics, and overall recognition in the broader\nmarket. The objective is to uncover insights into how the company is perceived, how its\nmanagement decisions or announcements generate market excitement, and what sets it apart from\nits competitors. Additionally, factors such as brand value and other relevant indicators shed light on\nthe company's socio-economic standing within the market.\nQuantitative analysis primarily focuses on utilizing statistical data, reports, and financial information.\nIt relies solely on the examination of a company's financial statements, quarterly performance\nreports, balance sheets, debt levels, cash flow statements, and other numerical data. This approach\ninvolves analyzing various numbers, ratios, and values to gain insights into the stock's price and\nassess the overall financial well-being of the company."}, {"title": "2.2 Fundamental analysis and machine learning", "content": "In a recent review of literature [47] on machine learning studies applied to stock market prediction\nusing fundamental, technical, and combined analyses, 66% of the reviewed documents are"}, {"title": "2.3 Technical analysis typologies", "content": "Technical analysis is a set of financial prediction techniques derived by the analysis of time series\nhistory of the particular asset price, either graphically or mathematically [15].\nAlthough technical analysis is not based on an underlying economic or financial theory, it is\nwidespread used among traditional financial practitioners in financial markets - in general - and in\nthe forex market - in particular - mainly in combination with fundamental analysis [15, 16].\nTechnical indicators calculated from historical time series data, or line charts based on security\nprices, or candlestick chart developed from historical data, are the main financial prediction\ntechniques of the technical analysis.\nTechnical indicators, which are statistical tools aimed at identifying buy or sell signals, are calculated\nfrom historical time series data with the use of specific formulas aimed at incorporating the\nhistorical price behaviour in a single value; the above formulas are based on prices and money\nvolumes related to past trading periods, usually no more than 20-30 trading periods [8]; because of\nthe very large number of possible parameter combinations within the technical indicators formulas,\nit is possible to obtain a very large number of possible trading rules; as example, in a large-scale\ninvestigation of technical trading rules of the foreign exchange market, Hsu et al.

[68] highlighted that, while technical indicators have been widely used as input\nvariables for stock market prediction, selecting suitable indicators remains a challenge.\nWith the aim to exploit the power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for an algorithmic\ntrading system, some authors have converted 1D values of financial technical indicators into a 2D\nimage-like data representation [12]; with the aim to directly use financial images which are\ncommonly analysed by financial practitioners, scholars recently proposed some CNN-based"}, {"title": "2.5 overview on the current studies about transfer learning and financial predictions", "content": "Transfer Learning, as <<the ability of a system to recognize and apply knowledge and skills learned in\nprevious tasks to novel tasks>>, is aimed at extracting << the knowledge from one or more source\ntasks and applies the knowledge to a target task>> [45]. Transfer learning can be categorized into\nthree primary types: transductive transfer learning, inductive transfer learning, and unsupervised\ntransfer learning [79]. Transductive transfer learning is exemplified by scenarios where labelled data\nis exclusively available in the source domain; in such cases, the source and target domains differ but\nare able to provide similar outer knowledge to support the learning process. In the context of\ntransductive transfer learning, a pre-trained model gains insights from both the source domain and\nthe source task; this acquired knowledge is subsequently leveraged to enhance the learning process\nof the target predictive function. In the context of inductive learning, knowledge transfer can be\ntransferred within the same domain. The source domain's data may be either labelled or unlabelled,\nwhile data in the target domain are typically labelled to facilitate the creation of an objective\npredictive model. Furthermore, inductive transfer learning can be subdivided based on the data\nconditions in the source domain, resulting in two distinct cases: multi-task learning and self-taught"}, {"title": "3 Research questions", "content": "According to the recent literature interest on the transfer learning methodology within the field of\nthe financial data prediction, and according to the current lack of specific literature reviews which\nare deeply and broadly focused on the above topic, this paper is aimed at answering to the following\nresearch questions:\n1.

{"title": "ON LEARNING CAPACITIES OF SUGENO INTEGRALS WITH SYSTEMS OF FUZZY RELATIONAL EQUATIONS", "authors": ["Ismail Baaj"], "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a method for learning a capacity underlying a Sugeno integral according to training data based on systems of fuzzy relational equations. To the training data, we associate two systems of equations: a max min system and a min max system. By solving these two systems (in the case that they are consistent) using Sanchez's results, we show that we can directly obtain the extremal capacities representing the training data. By reducing the max min (resp. min - max) system of equations to subsets of criteria of cardinality less than or equal to q (resp. of cardinality greater than or equal to n q), where n is the number of criteria, we give a sufficient condition for deducing, from its potential greatest solution (resp. its potential lowest solution), a q-maxitive (resp. q-minitive) capacity. Finally, if these two reduced systems of equations are inconsistent, we show how to obtain the greatest approximate q-maxitive capacity and the lowest approximate q-minitive capacity, using recent results to handle the inconsistency of systems of fuzzy relational equations.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In decision theory, Sugeno integral [13] is commonly used as a qualitative aggregation function [8] with values on a finite scale L. The definition of this integral is based on an set function called capacity, which qualitatively models the importance (or interaction) of subsets of criteria, and is used in many fields [7] such as uncertainty modeling, multicriteria aggregation or in game theory.\nIn recent years, many approaches, e.g. [1, 3, 5], have been proposed to learn (in closely related senses) the capacity of a Sugeno integral according to N training data, each training data item being a pair (object, targeted global evaluation).\nIn this article, we propose an approach for learning a capacity underlying a Sugeno integral according to training data, which is based on systems of fuzzy relational equations. Our goal is as follows: the Sugeno integral defined by a learned capacity should allow us to obtain, for each object in the training data, its targeted global evaluation, or an approximated value in a specific sense. Our approach is based on the fact that the definition of the Sugeno integral of an object defined by a capacity is given by a max min product between a row matrix containing the minimum of the partial evaluations of the object studied with respect to the subsets of criteria, and a column vector whose components are the measures of the subsets of criteria defined by the capacity. The Sugeno integral can also be obtained by a min max product similarly defined.\nThese two expressions of the Sugeno integral allow us to introduce two systems of fuzzy relational equations, one of type max min and a second of type min max for our learning problem. The matrix of each system is constructed from the objects in the training data, while the second member of each system consists of the targeted global evaluations. Under some natural conditions, the solving of each of the two systems, based on the work of Sanchez [12], produces a vector whose components define the measures of the subsets of criteria of a capacity."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "In what follows, we recall the definition of the Sugeno integral and the main results for solving systems of fuzzy relational equations."}, {"title": "2.1 Sugeno integral", "content": "The Sugeno integral framework (see [6] for more details) includes:\nC = {1,2,..., n} : a set of n criteria,\nL = {\u00a71 = 0, \u00a72, . . ., \u03be\u03b9 = 1} : an evaluation scale (a totally ordered finite set \u00a71 = 0 < \u00a72 < \uff65\uff65\uff65 < \u03be\u03b9 = 1) or L = [0, 1].\n\u03bc: 2C \u2192 La capacity, i.e., a set function such that \u03bc(0) = 0,\u03bc(C) = 1 and A C B \u21d2 \u03bc(A) \u2264 \u03bc(\u0392).

{"title": "The Pitfalls of Publishing in the Age of LLMs: Strange and Surprising Adventures with a High-Impact NLP Journal", "authors": ["Rakesh M. Verma", "Nachum Dershowitz"], "abstract": "We show the fraught side of the academic publishing realm and illustrate it through a recent case study with an NLP journal.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the dawn of the age of Large Language Models (LLMs), already much has been said about how researchers are making use of LLMs to author articles. For example, according to an article in Scientific American [1], \u201cOne percent of scientific articles published in 2023 showed signs of generative AI's potential involvement, according to a recent analysis.\" However, far less has been said about how reviewers are now abusing their role, sometimes with the editor's collusion.\nHere is our report of a case in point. We submitted a manuscript on domain-independent deception detection to a highly respected journal. As a consequence of a reviewer's use of an LLM, we both received a most peculiar review and also lost the promised confidentiality regarding our submission."}, {"title": "The Strange Case of a Submission in Computational Linguistics", "content": "On the last day of August 2023, we, along with three other colleagues, submitted an article to a prominent journal in natural language processing (NLP) slash computational linguistics (CL). Two and a half months later, on 17 November, the editor-in-chief sent us three reviews. One of them stood out, as it was clearly written for the most part by a machine. We quote it verbatim below:\nReviewer B:\n1. Originality: Based on the information provided in the paper, the paper does contain some new information and insights related to the field of deception detection. However, the paper presents some novel methods and findings, it's essential to assess whether these contributions significantly advance the current state of the field.\n2. Relationship to Literature:\nThe paper demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the relevant literature in the field. It cites a wide range of literature sources, including academic papers, books, and software tools, to provide context and support for the research. The references cover various aspects of deception detection, includ-ing linguistic analysis, machine learning, and psychology, which indicates a comprehensive review of the literature.\nThe paper generally acknowledges and cites significant work in the field of de-ception detection. It references various established techniques, datasets, and prior research contributions related to the detection of deceptive content. How-ever, it's essential to note that the significance of the work can vary depending on the specific focus of the paper. While the paper references a substantial body of literature, it may not cover every single significant work due to the breadth of the field. Overall, the paper's literature review appears to be thor-ough, covering a wide range of relevant sources. However, the assessment of whether any \"significant\" work is ignored can be subjective, as it depends on the specific criteria for significance and the scope of the paper. We may have varying opinions on whether certain works should have been included, but the paper generally provides a solid foundation in terms of referencing relevant literature.\n3. Methodology\nThe paper does build its argument on an appropriate base of theory and concepts related to deception detection. It draws upon established theories and techniques from linguistics, natural language processing, and psychology to frame its research. However, while the theoretical foundation is generally sound, there could be more explicit connections between the chosen theories and the specific research questions addressed in the paper.\nThe design of the research in the paper is generally well-structured. It presents a systematic exploration of various methods and techniques for deception detec-tion, including linguistic analysis, machine learning, and cross-domain applications. However, the paper lacks some details on specific aspects of the research design, such as the selection criteria for datasets and the rationale behind the chosen eval-uation metrics. Providing more transparency in these areas would enhance the paper's rigor.\nThe paper employs a wide range of methods, including linguistic analysis, machine learning, and cross-domain experiments. These methods are suitable for investigat-ing deception detection, given the multidisciplinary nature of the field. However, the appropriateness of the methods could be further validated by discussing their advantages and limitations in the context of the research questions. Additionally, the paper should clarify the criteria used to select specific methods or models for experimentation and analysis. In summary, while the paper does build its argu-ment on relevant theories and concepts and demonstrates a well-structured research design, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting the chosen theories to the research questions and providing more details on the research design and method selection criteria.\n4. Results: The presentation of results and the analysis in the paper generally follow a structured and systematic approach. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of clarity and the alignment of conclusions with the other elements of the paper. Here's a detailed evaluation:\nStrengths:\na. The paper organizes the presentation of results in a systematic manner, of-ten following a clear structure of introducing the research question, detailing the methodology, and presenting findings.\nb. Visual aids, such as tables, figures, and charts, are used to illustrate key results, which enhances the clarity of the presentation.\nc. The paper incorporates quantitative analysis, which is appropriate for the re-search objectives, and uses statistical measures to describe and evaluate results.\nd. In some sections, the paper compares its findings with existing methods or benchmarks, which provides context and helps assess the significance of the results.\nAreas for Improvement:\na. While the paper presents results, the depth of analysis could be enhanced. In some instances, the analysis is somewhat descriptive and lacks deeper insights or interpretations of the findings.\nb. The paper should clearly indicate the statistical significance of the results where applicable. This is essential to support the validity of the findings.\nc. For a more comprehensive understanding, qualitative analysis (e.g., linguistic analysis of deceptive cues) could be incorporated where relevant, especially in sections related to linguistic aspects of deception.\nConclusions (Strengths and Areas for Improvement):\na. The conclusions section provides a concise summary of the key findings and their implications, which is a strength.\nb. The conclusions should be scrutinized to ensure they align closely with the research objectives and the results presented earlier in the paper. In some cases, there may be a need for clearer connections between results and conclusions.\nc. It would be beneficial for the paper to include recommendations for future research based on the findings. This helps to demonstrate the broader significance of the research.\nd. While the paper discusses theoretical aspects, it could provide more insights into the practical implications of the research. How can the findings be applied in real-world scenarios or specific domains?\ne. The conclusions should acknowledge the limitations of the research. This adds transparency and helps readers assess the generalizability of the findings.\nIn summary, the paper generally presents results in a structured manner, but there is room for deeper analysis and more explicit connections between results and conclusions. Strengthening the alignment with research objectives, discussing practical implications, and addressing limitations will enhance the overall quality of the conclusions section.\n5. Implications for research, practice and/or society:\nThe paper extensively reviews and discusses existing literature and techniques related to deception detection, providing a comprehensive overview of the field. This can serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners looking to understand the state of the art.\nIt introduces various methodologies and approaches for deception detection, includ-ing linguistic analysis, machine learning, and multi-modal techniques. These meth-ods have the potential to impact research in natural language processing, machine learning, and psychology.\nThe discussion of datasets and evaluation metrics can guide researchers in selecting appropriate resources for their studies and help standardize evaluation practices in the field, contributing to the improvement of deception detection systems.\nWhile the paper doesn't explicitly state practical applications, the techniques dis-cussed, if further developed, could have real-world implications. For instance, im-proving deception detection algorithms could enhance security measures in various domains, including cybersecurity and law enforcement.\nOverall, the paper indirectly identifies implications for research and practice by pre-senting a wealth of information and methodologies related to deception detection. However, it could benefit from more explicit discussions of the practical applica-tions and societal impacts of these techniques.\nTo further bridge the gap, the paper could benefit from case studies or practical ex-amples illustrating how these techniques have been applied in real-world scenarios, demonstrating their practical utility.\nIn summary, the paper presents a comprehensive overview of deception detec-tion techniques and research, indirectly identifying implications for research and practice. While it establishes a strong theoretical foundation, it could enhance its impact by explicitly discussing practical applications and providing concrete examples of how these techniques can be used in real-world contexts.\n6. Quality of Communication:\nThe paper generally maintains a high level of clarity in its expression. It effec-tively conveys complex technical concepts, making them accessible to readers with the expected knowledge in the field.\nSentence structures are generally clear and coherent, aiding in the compre-hension of the content. However, there are instances of overly long sentences and complex language that may pose readability challenges for some read-ers. Streamlining sentence structure and using simpler language in these cases would enhance overall readability.\nThe paper shows a reasonable level of attention to clarity and readability, evident through well-structured sections, headings, and subheadings that guide readers through the content.\nAcronyms and technical terms are typically defined upon first use, enhancing comprehension for a broad readership.\nWhile there are some grammatical issues and typographical errors present in the text, they do not significantly detract from the overall clarity. For examples:\na. Long sentences:\nOriginal Sentence: \"In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on deception detection, highlighting the key approaches, methodologies, and challenges in this domain, and we discuss how the proposed task aligns with and contributes to the broader research landscape.\"\nRevised Sentence: \"In this section, we comprehensively review existing liter-ature on deception detection. We highlight key approaches, methodologies, and challenges in this domain. Additionally, we discuss how the proposed task aligns with and contributes to the broader research landscape.\"\nOriginal Sentence: \u201cOne of the central challenges in deception detection is the development of robust models that can effectively generalize across differ-ent domains, languages, and modalities, as deceptive content can manifest in various forms, including textual, visual, and audiovisual media.\"\nRevised Sentence: \u201cA central challenge in deception detection is developing robust models that generalize effectively across diverse domains, languages, and modalities. Deceptive content can take various forms, such as textual, visual, and audiovisual media.\"\nOriginal Sentence: \"Furthermore, the task of deception detection often in-volves addressing issues related to imbalance in the distribution of deceptive and truthful instances, as deceptive content is typically less prevalent than truthful content, which can lead to biased models that favor the majority class.\"\nRevised Sentence: \u201cMoreover, deception detection tasks frequently require addressing issues related to imbalanced distributions of deceptive and truthful instances. Deceptive content is usually less common than truthful content, potentially leading to biased models favoring the majority class.\"\nOriginal Sentence: \"To address these challenges, researchers have explored a wide range of features and representations, including linguistic features, stylis-tic cues, syntactic patterns, semantic embeddings, visual attributes, acoustic features, and multimodal fusion techniques, to capture the nuances of decep-tive communication.\"\nRevised Sentence: \u201cResearchers have tackled these challenges by exploring di-verse features and representations.

Based on one usable review (the third review was specious), a decision to reject our manuscript was taken with lightening speed in the world of academia. (Having lost all confidentiality expectations, we decided to upload our paper to Arxiv [2].)\nAs is obvious from the review, it could not possibly have been authored by a human reviewer. For example, the review consists of inane suggestions in the form of offering our sentence from the manuscript as an improved form of our sentence from the manuscript.\nSo we then uploaded our manuscript to ChatGPT4 from a premium account and also the review in question and we asked ChatGPT4 to act as an expert reviewer with a decade of experience and to rate various aspects of the review on a scale of 1 to 5.

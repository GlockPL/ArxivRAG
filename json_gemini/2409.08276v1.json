AnySkin addresses the critical challenges that impede the use of tactile sensing \u2013 versatility, replaceability, and data reusability. Building on the simplistic design of ReSkin, and decoupling the sensing electronics from the sensing interface, AnySkin simplifies integration making it as straightforward as putting on a phone case and connecting a charger. Furthermore, AnySkin is the first uncalibrated tactile-sensor with cross-instance generalizability of learned manipulation policies. To summarize, this work makes three key contributions: first, we introduce a streamlined fabrication process and a design tool for creating an adhesive-free, durable and easily replaceable magnetic tactile sensor; second, we characterize slip detection and policy learning with the AnySkin sensor; and third, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization of models trained on one instance of AnySkin to new instances, and compare it with popular existing tactile solutions like DIGIT and ReSkin.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Touch sensing is widely recognized as a crucial modality for biological movement and control [1], [2]. Unlike vision, sound, or proprioception, touch provides sensing at the point of contact, allowing agents to perceive and reason about forces and pressure. However, a closer examination of robotics literature reveals a different narrative. Prominent works and current state-of-the-art in robot learning primarily utilize vision sensing in conjunction with proprioception to train manipulation skills [3], [4], often ignoring touch. If touch is indeed vital from a biological perspective, why does it remain a second-class citizen in sensorimotor control?\nTo address this question, let's examine what made cameras ubiquitous in robotics. Three key factors are at play: cost, convenience, and consistency. Cameras are relatively inexpensive (under $20), easy to integrate on a wide variety of robot platforms (e.g. multi-view, depth, ego-centric), and allow for models trained on them (e.g. object detection, segmentation) to easily transfer to images captured with new cameras. In contrast, touch sensors are often costly due to expensive fabrication processes [5] (e.g., pressure-based sensors) or the need for high-end components [6] (e.g., Biotac). They are inconvenient to use on different robot platforms, being custom-built for specific robot end-effectors and constrained form factors requiring extensive adaptation for different shapes [7], [8]. Finally, touch sensors are inconsistent. Due to boutique fabrication, sensor profiles can vary significantly even when produced through the same process [9], [10]. This inconsistency poses a challenge when transferring tactile-based models across different instances of the same sensor. This transfer is particularly critical for touch sensors due to their persistent need for replacement. Soft sensing interfaces \u2013 imperative to touch sensors to preserve grasp stability \u2013 wear out faster than hard interfaces, leading to more frequent replacements.\nIn this work we present AnySkin, a new touch sensor that"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Existing literature on tactile sensing explores a wide range of modalities, each with their own set of advantages and limitations. Capacitative sensors [11], [12] sense contact through changes in capacitance, offering high sensitivity. However, they struggle to model shear force and are prone to breakage due to direct electrical connections between the circuitry and elastomer. Resistive sensors [5], [13], [14] are simple and durable, but tend to provide spatially discrete sensing with low spatial resolution. Optical sensors [8], [15], [16] capture high-resolution contact information using cameras to track the deformation of an elastomer, but often pose hard, stringent limits on the sensor form factor, due to the physical constraints on the camera field of view. This complicates integration for a wide range of applications and significantly increases the effort required to sensorize surfaces of different shapes and sizes.\nMagnetic tactile sensors [17], [18] largely overcome these limitations due to three salient advantages: (a) separation of the sensing electronics from the sensing interface to improve robustness (b) compatibility with different form factors, and (c) an ability to capture shear forces [9]. Two prominent"}, {"title": "III. ANYSKIN: COMPONENTS", "content": "AnySkin builds on ReSkin [9], a tactile skin composed of a soft magnetized skin coupled with magnetometer-based sensing circuitry. By detecting distortions in magnetic fields, ReSkin measures skin deformations caused by normal and shear forces [17], [9]. Its adaptability enables integration across various applications, from robotic hands [20] to arm sleeves and even dog shoes.

ANYSKIN: FABRICATION", "content": "The overall fabrication procedure follows the general outline of ReSkin: Magnetic particles and elastomer are mixed in specified ratios; the resulting mixture is poured into the molds; cured skins are magnetized. The shape of the fingertip-skin assembly is designed to be triangular as shown in Figure 1 to improve reachability. In this section, we elaborate on the details of the fabrication procedure for AnySkin, and key changes to the ReSkin fabrication procedure that result in a new, upgraded sensor."}, {"title": "V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "content": "In this section, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the capabilities of AnySkin as a tactile sensor, and within the context of policy learning. These experiments are designed to answer the following questions:\n\u2022 How do the fabrication changes outlined in Section III influence signal characteristics?\n\u2022 Can AnySkin sensors be used to detect slip?\n\u2022 How does AnySkin's ease of replaceability compare with other sensors like DIGIT and ReSkin?\n\u2022 How does replacing AnySkin affect the performance of learned policies, and how does this compare with other sensors like ReSkin and DIGIT?"}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS", "content": "In this paper, we present AnySkin, a new magnetic tactile sensor. AnySkin is versatile, self-adhering and improves on the repeatability of sensor response across different instances of the skin. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, AnySkin is the first sensor to demonstrate zero-shot generalization of visuotactile policies to new instances of the tactile skin. As we work towards developing more capable and performant models utilizing tactile data, AnySkin is the first step towards ensuring that large datasets of tactile data can be collected and effectively used for training useful, generalizable models. This work opens the door to a host of exciting applications of AnySkin. It could be incorporated into a large-scale data collection tool such as UMI [29] or the Stick [30], [31]. Future work could also investigate simple calibration schemes or conditional learning frameworks to completely close the gap between training and swapped skin instances. Deeper investigations into standardizing the fabrication procedure could also help further improve signal consistency."}]}

The occurrence of a variable and the occurrence of its negation simultaneously can give very useful information for certain frameworks where the human reasoning plays a key role. Hence, the resolution of bipolar fuzzy relation equations systems is a research topic of great interest. This paper focuses on the study of bipolar fuzzy relation equations systems based on the max-product t-norm composition. Specifically, the solvability and the algebraic structure of the set of solutions of these bipolar equations systems will be studied, including the case in which such systems are composed of equations whose independent term be equal to zero.

Introduction", "content": "A broad development of the theory and applications of fuzzy relational equations (FREs), based on different max-t-norm compositions, has been carried out since they were introduced by Sanchez in the 1980s [2, 3]. In the literature, we can find many papers dealing with the resolution of (systems of) FREs defined with either the max-min composition [4, 5, 6, 7], the max-product composition [8, 9, 10, 11], the max-Archimedean t-norm composition [12, 13, 14] or other different compositions [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In what regards to the applied perspective, it is important to emphasize that FREs have increased the range of applications of fuzzy sets theory. The compression and decompression of images and videos [26], the modeling of fuzzy inference systems in fuzzy control [27] and the representation of restrictions in optimization problems [28, 29, 30, 31], among others, are some of the most recent applications of FREs based on max- t-norm compositions. FREs have also been related to other mathematical frameworks, such as fuzzy formal concept analysis [18, 19]. A new type of (system of) fuzzy relation equations arises when equations contain unknown variables together with their logical negations simultaneously. This new kind of equations are called bipolar fuzzy relation equations. Considering a negation operator provides the standard fuzzy relation equations with flexibility in the applications, as it is shown in [32, 33, 34, 35, 36], where bipolar fuzzy relations equations have been successfully used in op- timization problems. To the best of our knowledge, the specific literature on the resolution of (systems of) bipolar fuzzy relation equations is really limited. A detailed analysis on the solvability of (systems) of bipolar max- min FREs with the standard negation is presented in [37]. Following this research line, we can also find a wide study on the resolution of (systems) of bipolar max-product FREs with the product negation in [1]. Clearly, the behaviour of the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm is differ- ent, therefore the results obtained in [1] are markedly different from those presented in [37]. In this paper, we are interested in continuing with the work done in [1]. A characterization theorem for the solvability of (systems of) bipolar max- product FREs with the product negation and the properties related to the algebraic structure of the set of solutions have been introduced in [1]. How- ever, the solvability of (systems of) bipolar max-product FREs, with some independent term equal to zero, is an open problem to be solved. Three different parts can be distinguished in our contribution. The first part introduces the notion of bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equation with the product negation. A characterization on the solvability of such equations is given and different properties associated with the existence of the greatest/least solution or a finite number of maximal/minimal solu- tions for these last equations are introduced. The second part shows under what conditions a bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equations system is solvable and presents the algebraic structure of the set of solutions of the solvable systems. Both parts take into consideration the possibility of the"}, {"title": "2. Bipolar FREs based on the product t-norm", "content": "A detailed study on the resolution of bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equations with the product negation was carried out in [1], where a charac- terization theorem for the solvability of such bipolar FREs was presented. The conditions to guarantee when a solvable bipolar max-product FRE has a greatest/least solution or a finite number of maximal/minimal solutions were also given in [1]. However, the results related to the existence of the greatest/least solution or a finite number of maximal/minimal solutions do not consider bipolar max-product FREs whose independent term is zero. In this section, we will focus on this task. Bipolar max-product FREs with the product negation are given from max-product FREs considering unknown variables together with their logi- cal negations simultaneously, in that case the product negation. The formal definition of a bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equation with the product negation is introduced below.\nDefinition 1. Let $a_j^+, a_j^-, b \\in [0, 1]$ and $x_j$ be an unknown variable belong- ing to $[0, 1]$, for all $j \\in \\{1, ..., m\\}$, $*$ the product t-norm, $\\bigvee$ the maximum operator and $n_p$ the product negation defined as $n_p(0) = 1$ and $n_p(x) = 0$, for all $x \\in ]0, 1]$. Equation (1) is called bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equation with the product negation.\n$\\bigvee_{j=1}^m (a_j^+ * x_j) \\bigvee (a_j^- * n_p(x_j)) = b$\nIn the following, we will characterize the solvability of bipolar fuzzy relation equations defined previously, that is, we will provide the sufficient and necessary conditions under which bipolar max-product FREs with the product negation are solvable.\nTheorem 2 ([1]). Let $a_j^+, a_j^-, b \\in [0, 1]$ and $x_j$ be an unknown variable belonging to $[0, 1]$, for all $j \\in \\{1, ..., m\\}$. The bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equation given by Equation (1) is solvable if and only if one of the following statements is verified:"}, {"title": "3. Solving bipolar FREs systems from the product t-norm", "content": "An initial study on the solvability of systems of bipolar max-product FREs with the product negation was presented in [1]. Now, we will deepen in this study including results related to the algebraic structure of the com- plete set of solutions corresponding to an arbitrary solvable system of bipolar max-product FREs with the product negation. It is worth highlighting that the conditions required to guarantee the solvability of systems of bipolar max-product FREs are significantly differ- ent from the obtained ones for only one bipolar max-product FRE. Specif- ically, the resolution of an arbitrary system of bipolar max-product FRES is characterized by the existence of two index sets satisfying certain prop- erties. The following definition includes the notion of feasible pair of index sets, which will play an important role from now on."}, {"title": "4. A toy example", "content": "This section will be devoted to illustrate how bipolar max-product FRES can be employed to represent a real-world situation. A toy example, in which a system of bipolar max-product fuzzy relation equations is capable of modeling the behaviour of a motor, will be presented. Specifically, the system of bipolar max-product FREs will be employed to determine what the reasons/causes of the levels of overheating and relative humidity inside the motor are and how a technician should perform in order to the motor works properly.\nExample 11. Technician experts establish that a motor works in an suit- able way when its temperature and its relative humidity are maintained under certain threshold, and therefore, they strongly recommend that the water level, the oil level and the functioning of radiator fan be controlled."}, {"title": "5. Conclusions and future work", "content": "We have solved one open problem given in [1], introducing a characteri- zation on the resolution of any bipolar max-product FREs system, including the systems with several zero elements in the independent terms. We have complemented this characterization with diverse properties related to the algebraic structure of the set of solutions of these systems. Hence, this pa- per has completed the study on the resolution of any kind of fuzzy relation equation with the product t-norm and its residuated negation. This t-norm is one of the most important and useful operators, which is very natural in the applications, as we have shown in Example 11. The consideration of arbitrary negations and the use of other general operators, such as uninorms and u-norms, instead of the product t-norm, will be fundamental in the development of future advances in this research topic."}]}

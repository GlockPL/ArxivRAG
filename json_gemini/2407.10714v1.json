A lot of research focuses on modeling users' lifelong sequences, which can be extremely long and sometimes exceed thousands of items. These models use the target item to search for the most relevant items from the historical sequence. However, training lifelong sequences in click through rate (CTR) prediction or personalized search ranking (PSR) is extremely difficult due to the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding, especially when the IDs in the lifelong sequence features do not exist in the samples of training dataset. Additionally, existing target attention mechanisms struggle to learn the multi-modal representations of items in the sequence well. The distribution of multi-modal embedding (text, image and attributes) output of user's interacted items are not properly aligned and there exist divergence across modalities. We also observe that users' search query sequences and item browsing sequences can fully depict users' intents and benefit from each other. To address these challenges, we propose a unified lifelong multi-modal sequence model called SEMINAR-Search Enhanced Multi-Modal Interest Network and Approximate Retrieval. Specifically, a network called Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) learns the lifelong sequences of multi-modal query-item pairs in a pretraining-finetuning manner with multiple objectives: multi-modal alignment, next query-item pair prediction, query-item relevance prediction, etc. After pretraining, the downstream model, which shares the same target attention structure with PSU, restores the pretrained embedding as initialization and finetunes the network. To accelerate the online retrieval speed of multi-modal embedding, we propose a multi-modal codebook-based product quantization strategy to approximate the exact attention calculation and significantly reduce the time complexity.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Users' behavior modeling is extremely important in modern commercial recommendation systems, including online e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Taobao, Alipay, and content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, etc. As users spend more time on online shopping and watching short videos, the length of users' historical behaviors has grown dramatically from a few hundreds (102) to more than ten-thousands (104) in recent years. A lot of recent research focuses on modeling users' lifelong behaviors, such as Efficient Target Attention (ETA) [3], Two-Stage Interest Network (TWIN) [2], Query-Dominant Interest Network (QIN) [8], etc. These models follow a cascading two-stage paradigm, which first uses the target item or target search query as a trigger to retrieve the top-K relevant behaviors from historical behaviors. In the second stage, it uses target attention to encode the selected behaviors as users' interest representation. This paradigm is widely adopted in many search and recommendation tasks, such as click through rate (CTR) prediction and personalized search ranking. The item representations in the sequence are computed using both the item ID feature and more generic attributes' features. One easily neglected problem in existing lifelong behavior modeling is the insufficient learning problem of ID features in the lifelong sequence, such as historical item ID, author ID, etc. Many historical items in the lifelong sequence can't be found in the current training dataset, which is collected from the most recent logs of exposures and clicks. These low frequency ID embeddings can't be learned well by the limited dataset after being randomly initialized, which will harm the accuracy of target attention calculation.\nThe second problem in existing lifelong sequence modeling is that it can't handle multi-modal features of items in the sequence well, such as text and image features. The norm values of vectors from different modalities vary if the modalities are not properly aligned in the same embedding space. Existing target item attention calculation uses the inner product of query and keys, which may be dominated by modality vectors with large norm values. For example, the target item will only retrieve the top-K visually relevant but semantically very different items from historical behaviors, which will deteriorate the online performance of recommendation.\nTo tackle these problems, we propose a new model called Search Enhanced Multi-Modal Interest Network and Approximate Retrieval (SEMINAR) to model users' lifelong historical multi-modal behaviors. The users' historical behaviors include heterogeneous behaviors of both the sequence of browsing item and the sequence of search query. We align users' search query sequence with browsing item sequence together as a unified sequence of query-item pairs, which can be retrieved flexibly by target item or target search query in both the CTR prediction task and Personalized Search Ranking (PSR) task. SEMINAR proposes a Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) network to learn the lifelong behavior sequence of historical multi-modal query-item pairs. It introduces multiple pretraining tasks designed to solve the insufficient learning issue of historical ID features and the multi-modal alignment. In downstream tasks, the target attention module restores the learned item representations from PSU, using the pretrained ID embedding as initialization, and applies a projection weight matrix to get the transformed representation of the behavior sequence. During online serving, calculating exact attention using the inner product of multi-modal vectors in the lifelong sequence has the time complexity of O(L \u00d7 M \u00d7 d), which is time consuming. L denotes the sequence length, M denotes the number of modalities and d denotes the embedding dimension. Different from existing approximate retrieval methods, such as Locally Sensitive Hash (LSH) and Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), we exploit an approximate strategy of Product Quantization in a multi-modal setting and express the multi-modal item representations as discrete integer codes using the quantization codebooks, and sum the inner product of centroids in sub-vectors to approximate the exact attention calculation. During online serving, the attention calculation is equivalent to pre-computed distance table lookup and summation operations, which can be conducted efficiently.\nIn summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows:\n\u2022 We identify the insufficient learning problem of ID features in lifelong behavior modeling and observe that target attention calculation is dominated by multi-modal features with large norm values. And we novelly propose SEMINAR framework, which includes the Pretraining Search Unit to effectively alleviate the insufficient learning problems of ID embedding and multi-modal alignment.\n\u2022 We exploit a product quantization approximation strategy in a multi-modal setting, which can reduce the time complexity during online serving of retrieval using target query item pair from historical behaviors.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. And we also released the code of SEMINAR in this repository 1 to encourage further research."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "2.1 Long-Term Lifelong User Behavior Modeling\nLong-term lifelong user behavior modeling has attracted much research attention in recent years. Typical works include SIM [12], ETA [3], TWIN [2], QIN [8], etc. SIM [12] introduces the General Search Unit to retrieve the top-K most relevant items from historical behaviors using the target item as a trigger, and the Exact Search Unit (ESU) to calculate the multi-head target attention (MHTA). ETA [3] uses a set of hash functions to express the item representation as binary hash embedding and calculates the Hamming distance to approximate the inner product calculation. TWIN [2] introduces the CP-GSU as a consistency-preserved lifelong user behavior modeling module to increase the relevance calculation consistency between the two cascading stages. QIN [8] uses the search query as a trigger to retrieve the most relevant items from the historical behaviors in the first stage of the cascading models in Personalized Search Ranking. Different from the existing work, we propose the pretraining search unit (PSU) to alleviate the insufficient learning problem of ID features and multi-modal alignment in attention calculation. Furthermore, there is an increasing trend of modeling search and recommendation tasks jointly in a unified framework, such as USER [19], SESRec [15], S&R Foundation [7], etc. To model the lifelong behaviors, we align the historical search query sequence and browsing item sequence as a unified sequence of query-item pairs, which can be applied to both CTR prediction in recommendation and personalized search ranking.\n2.2 Multi-Modal Alignment in\nRecommendation and Item Quantization\nMulti-modal alignment is a prevalent topic, which aligns the multi-modal features such as text and image in a unified embedding space in a contrastive learning manner. Typical works include CLIP [13], etc. Some researchers have focused on modeling multi-modal user sequences in recommendation. M5 [21] applies a multi-modal embedding layer to extract both ID embeddings of show ID and content-graph embeddings initialized from a meta-path pretrained model. To better increase the generalization of ID embeddings, some research is proposed to express item representations as quantized vectors in discrete codes, including Product Quantization [10], VQ-VAE [17], RQ-VAE [20], etc. VQ-Rec [9] proposes to encode text as discrete codes using product quantization techniques and use transformer to learn cross-domain data in recommendation. TIGER"}, {"title": "3 PROPOSED MODEL", "content": "3.1 Problem Formulation\nWe can split the sequence of users' behaviors into several heterogeneous sub-sequences, including the sequence of search queries Q = {q1, q2, .., q|Q|} of explicit intents and the sequence of browsing recommended items B = {i1, i2, ..., i|B|}. For search behaviors, users input a query q \u2208 Q and interact (click or view) with a few items related to the query, resulting in the aligned sequence of query and item pairs (q\u0131, i\u2081). For the behavior of browsing recommended items, users browse a sequence of items without explicit search intent, and we pad an empty search query q = 0 to each item to obtain the query-item pair as (q1 = 0, i\u2081). Finally, we construct a unified sequence of aligned query-item pairs in chronological order with length L, denoted as {(q\u0131, i1)}I=1:L. In some recommendation scenarios, such as short video recommendations of YouTube and TikTok, each item has multi-modal features such as text (title of video), image, and attributes (authors and categories). We further split the sequence of browsed items B into M multi-modal sub-sequences, including a sequence of text features T = {T1, T2, ..., T\u2081}, a sequence of image features I = {I1, I2, ..., IL }, and a sequence of attribute features A = {A1, A2, ..., AL }. Finally, we let [Q,T, I, A] \u2208 R(M+1)\u00d7L\u00d7d denote the input sequence of multi-modal query-item pairs to the SEMINAR model and d denotes the dimension of aligned representations.\n3.2 Aligned Lifelong Sequence of Multi-Modal\nQuery-Item Pairs\nThe aligned sequence of multi modal query-item pairs pass the embedding layers. We let [x1 = (xquery, xitem)]1=1:L denote the historical sequence of query and item pairs. xquery \u2208 Rd, xitem = (xtext, ximage, xattributes) \u2208 RM\u00d7d. In CTR prediction, target attention (TA) is a structure which uses target item to retrieve the most relevant items from the sequence of historical behaviors. We extend TA from target item to target query-item pair to retrieve most relevant top K pairs from historical sequence. We denote the target query-item pair as xt = (xqueryxtext, image, xattributes).\n3.3 SEMINAR Model Architecture\nOur proposed model SEMINAR introduces a new network Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) to pretrain using dataset of the lifelong sequence of multi-modal query-item pairs. Section 3.3.1 introduces the PSU and corresponding pretraining tasks. Section 3.3.2 introduces how the recommendation model restores the pretrained"}, {"title": "3.3.1 Pretraining Search Unit", "content": "The input to PSU is the aligned sequence of query-item pairs as [x1]1=1:L. L denotes the length of the aligned sequence and x1 = (xquery, text, image, xattributes) represents the l-th behavior in the sequence, which consists of the query embedding and multi-modal embedding. The query q \u2208 Q passes through the query feature encoder f(.), resulting in Q = f(xquery) \u2208 RLxdquery. Following the multi-modal alignment literature such as CLIP [13], we use Transformer [18] to encode the text feature as T = Encodertext (xtext) \u2208 RLxdtext_and ViT [5] to encode the image features as I = Encoderimage(ximage) \u2208 RL\u00d7dimage. Additionally, we encode features of the attributes using the function g(.). A = g(xattribute) \u2208 RL\u00d7dattribute is treated as one channel of the sub-sequence which participates in the multi-modal alignment of the item sequence. To project the representations of different channels to the same dimension d, we further multiply them by linear weight matrix {Wq, Wt, Wi, Wa} and get the stacked input sequence of multi-modal query-item pairs as follows:\nx = [QWq, TWt, IW\u2081, AWa] \u2208 R(M+1)\u00d7L\u00d7d.\nNext Pair Prediction and Multi-Head Target Attention. The intuition behind PSU is to design a pretraining network to learn from the lifelong behavior sequence, and the pretraining network should share the same structure of multi-head target attention with the cascading two-stage downstream model, such as ETA [3] and TWIN [2]. The downstream model restores the pretrained query and item embeddings as initialization of parameters and fine-tunes the network. Different from the masked language model (MLM) in BERT [4], which uses tokens from the context window to predict the masked token, we use next-pair prediction as a pretraining task to predict the correct last query and item pair. We intentionally leave out the last query-item pair in the sequence XL = [x(m)], m \u2208 [Q, T, I, A], and treat it as the target query-item pair to retrieve from the previous (L - 1) sequence using multi-head target attention. To pad the sequence length from L \u2013 1 to L, we further add a special token < EOS > to the end of the previous L-1 items in the sequence X1:L-1. The next query-item pair prediction task is formulated as classification tasks: y = p(x]:M+1\\x1M+1;x<EOS>) with the loss Lhext. Positive label is assigned to the correct last pair, and negative labels are assigned to negatively sampled query-item pairs.\nTo better represent the historical behaviors and target query-item pair, we need to fuse the query and multi-modal item representations into a single vector as:\n\\(x = x_{query} + (1 - \\lambda) w_i x_{item} (i) = \\sum_{m \\in M+1} \\gamma_m x^{(m)}\\)\n\u03bb and (1 \u2013 \u03bb) denote the weight to merge representations of query and item vectors respectively as \u03bb\u2208 [0, 1], and wi denotes the weight to merge multi-modal item representations. To simplify the notations, we use a single vector [ym]1:M+1 \u2208 RM+1 to represent the weight of all (M + 1) channels and the sum of the weight equals to 1 as \\(\\sum_m y_m = 1\\). The weight vector ym can be learned dynamically as the softmax output of a gating network. The attention is calculated as the inner product of queries and keys of the merged multi-channel representations. The final attention score will be dominated by the modals with large norm values \\(|x^{(m)}|\\) and large weight ym, and the information from other modals will be easily ignored. So we specifically decompose the attention score calculation into the norm value part \\(|x^{(m)}|\\) and unit vector part \\(\\hat{x}^{(m)}\\).\nWe let qt denote the representation of target query-item pair as \\(q_t = \\sum_i \\gamma_i x^{(i)} = \\sum_i \\gamma_i |x^{(i)}| \\hat{x}^{(i)}\\). Note that the \\(|x^{(i)}|\\) denotes the norm value of the i-th channel of target item and \\(\\hat{x}^{(i)}\\) is a unit vector. Similarly, we can express the l - th historical behavior as \\(k_l = \\sum_i \\gamma_i x^{(i)} = \\sum_i \\gamma_i |x^{(i)}| \\hat{x}^{(i)}\\). Note that the unit vectors of multi-modal sequence representations will participate in the multi-modal alignment task in the next section.\nThe h-th head in the multi-head attention is represented as headPSUh = Attentionh (qt, KPSU, VPSU), and the attention score aPSU is calculated as inner product of d-dimensional vector query and keys multiplied by a scaling factor\n\\[\\alpha_h^{PSU} = \\frac{(q_tW_{h}^{PSUQ}) (K^{PSU} W_{h}^{PSUK})^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\]\n\\[\\alpha_h^{PSU} = \\frac{\\sum_{ij} \\gamma_{ij} |x^{PSU(i)}| |x^{PSU(j)}|}{\\sqrt{d}} \\quad \\sum_{l=1}^{L} [ \\hat{x}^{PSU (i)} W_{h}^{PSUQ} ] [ \\hat{x}^{PSU(j)} W_{h}^{PSUK} ]^T\\]\nIn this formulation, [xPSU (1:M+1)]=1 \u2208 RL\u00d7(M+1)\u00d7d denotes the multi-modal embedding of items in the sequence of PSU and xPSU (1:M+1) = [Q,T, I, A]. And KPSU = [\u2211i YixPSU (i)]=1 \u2208 RLxd denotes the merged representations of input sequence. \\(W_{h}^{PSUQ} \\in R^{d \\times d}\\) and \\(W_{h}^{PSUK} \\in R^{d \\times d}\\) denote the projection weight matrix of query and keys in h-th head, and yij denotes the weight of cross-modal interaction of unit query vector and unit key vector in the sequence. Yij equals to the scalar product of yi, yj, the norm value of query vector \\(|x^{PSU(i)}|\\) and the norm value of key vector \\(|x^{PSU(j)}|\\)."}, {"title": "3.3.1 Multi-Modal Alignment and Query-Item Relevance", "content": "Multi-modal alignment is a crucial task, which learns the multi-modal representation in a same embedding space. Typical alignment models, such as CLIP [13], maximize the cosine similarity of the correct N (text-image) pairs and minimize the cosine similarity of the incorrect N\u00b2 \u2013 N mismatch pairs. We simultaneously train multi-modal alignment tasks, including text-image, image-attributes, text-attributes with the cross entropy loss of N pairs.\nLalign = \u03a3\u03a3 LCLIP(x(i), x(j)), (i, j) \u2208 {T, I, A}\nieM jeMzi\nSequence length L is usually large and the alignment has complexity of O(L2). To reduce the complexity, we further split the sequence into Nch chunks. Each chunk is a sub-sequence with length Lsub = L. The alignment loss is the sum of multiple losses within Nchchunks as LCLIP(1) = kench LCLIP(1:4) L:L+1) with complexity reduced to O(L2/Nch).\nAdditionally, query item relevance prediction is a typical search task, usually modelled as binary classification to predict the correct query-item pair from irrelevant query-item pairs. Each pair of query and item is represented as [xquery;xitem = m\u2208M Ymxitem(m)].\nLoss for query-item relevance binary classification task is Lquery-item = \u03a3Lce(y\u00b2; xquery, Em\u2208M Ymxitem(m)).

The objective of Pretraining Search Unit (PSU) consists of three parts, the next query-item pair prediction loss Lherr, multi-modal alignment loss Lalign and the query-item relevance prediction loss Lquery-item.

In the first stage, target item or query is used as trigger to retrieve the most relevant top-K items from the users' long behaviors sequence and reduce the sequence length from L to K, such as the General Search Unit (GSU) in SIM [12], TWIN [2], and Relevance Search Unit (RSU) in QIN [8]. In the second stage, a multi head target attention (MHTA) unit in Exact Search Unit (ESU) is applied to encode the selected K relevant items as the representation of users' behavior sequence. However, existing cascading two-stage paradigm suffers from the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding in the lifelong sequence ([xquery, xtext, ximage attributes ]). The downstream model, e.g. CTR prediction, lacks of enough training data to learn the embedding in the sequence well. Especially when some low-frequency items in the sequence exist a long time ago (more than one year) and don't exist in the training data, which are collected from most recently users' logs.\nTo help alleviate the insufficient learning problem of ID embedding in the lifelong sequence, the general search unit (GSU) in our proposed SEMINAR model shares the same multi-head target attention structure headGSUn = Attention\u0127(qt, KGSU, VGSU) with the structure in PSU as headPSUn = Attention(qt, KPSU, VPSU), restores the pretrained embedding from PSU and applies specific projection weight matrix G(j) \u2208 Rd\u00d7d to the pretrained embedding. After the first stage retrieval, the sequence length is reduced from L to K, the second stage ESU also shares the same multi-head target attention structure headESUh = Attention(qt, KESU, VESU) with GSU and PSU, and has specific projection weight matrix W, WK, WV of each head.\nGSU restores the pretrained query item multi-modal embedding [EPSU (Q), EPSU (T), EPSU(I), EPSU(A)] from PSU, and applies pro-jection matrix G(j) \u2208 Rd\u00d7d to get the projected embedding in GSU as xGSU (j). EPSU (*) denotes the pretrained multi-modal embedding. And the attention score aGSU in the h-th head of GSU's multi-head target attention is calculated as:\n\\[\\alpha_{an}^{GSU} = \\frac{(q_tW_{h}^{GSUQ}) (K^{GSU} W_{h}^{GSUK})^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\]\nxGSU(j) = xPSU(j)Gj, \u2200j \u2208 M + 1\nComparing the GSU attention a&SU with the pretrained PSU attention aPSU, we can see that the structures of multi-head target attention are exactly the same. The projection weights W, WGSUQ and WGSUK of queries and keys for each head in multi head attention are different from W WPSUQ and WPSUK. And the embedding projection weight matrix Gj is unique to GSU.\nIn the second stage, the top-K relevant query-item pairs are selected from GSU and fed to Exact Search Unit (ESU) as headESUn = Attentionh (qt, KESU, VESU).\nIn ESU, KESU = TopK(KGSU) \u2208 R(M+1)\u00d7K\u00d7D represents the sequence of retrieved top-K representations from KGSU \u2208 R(M+1)\u00d7L\u00d7D.

However, there are difficulties in building an embedding index to retrieve the target query-item pair from the sequence of multi-modal query-item pairs. To search the vectors of behaviors given the input target query-item pair qt as in the exact attention calculation, we build a vector index which assigns a primary key to represent each vector, such as Item ID, Query ID, etc. However, in our aligned sequence of query-item pairs, each merged query-item representation have the joint key of (query_id, item_id), and the required amount of storage increases from the item set size |B| to the cartesian product of the query set size |Q| and the item set size |B| as |Q||B|, which is almost infeasible to store the merged query-item pair in a single index directly."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENT", "content": "4.1 Experimental Settings\nDataset We evaluate our proposed SEMINAR model on three datasets: two public datasets including Amazon review dataset (Movies and TV subset) 2 and the KuaiSAR 3 search and recommendation dataset, one industrial dataset Alipay short video dataset.

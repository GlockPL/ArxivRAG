Introduction", "content": "Inefficient energy consumption and elevated expenses represent merely two of the challenges linked to the water supply system, an essential component of infrastructure that delivers water to final consumers, such as enterprises, the populace, and agricultural sectors [1]. The establishment of facilities for the transportation of water is not a contemporary achievement of civilization. Throughout this era, developments in science and engineering have enabled water to be transported over long distances through the use of valves and pipelines [2]. Aging, urbanization, population growth, climate change, and other factors challenge an already strained WDS [3]. The water supply and bent technology vicious cycle should be broken up simultaneously, reconstructing water networks designed to elevate efficiency, reliability, and promotion in this context even risks [4].\nThis type of digital transformation helps solve these systemic issues. Water utilities can track and control their systems remotely with IoT technology, AI, and DTs. Predictive maintenance, the ability to look after systems and devices in real-time, and simulations of systems are made possible to the benefit of system efficiency and, at the same time, minimize operational costs [5, 6]. However, despite these advances in digitalization related to WDS, there are still a number of significant challenges to overcome: data structuring, model precision, and interfacing with legacy systems [7]. Ensuring long-term viability and operational efficiency in WDS requires technological innovation and the adoption of sustainability-driven business models. Similar to how manufacturing firms are restructuring their business models to achieve sustainable value creation and delivery [17], the water sector must integrate environmental, social, and governance principles into its digital transformation strategies.\nThe major focus on DTs technology is that it is presently one of the newsmaking, adopted adjunct technologies that will affect the operation of business organizations. They are defined as virtual models of discrete physical systems and run in real time with data and simulations important for the augmentation of performance of a system [8]. In water distribution, DTs can enhance system design, predict the needs around maintenance, conduct simulations concerning this system's operational capability, and many others [9]. Unlike the above proposition, bottlenecks explicit of deploying DTs in this particular industry are insecurity, data protection, and the need for a competent workforce, among others [10].\nIn this article, we leverage the application of DTs within the water industry and extend it to urban and rural water distribution and transmission networks to propose a novel platform model."}, {"title": "1.1.

These costs can be prohibitive for SMEs, limiting their ability to adopt advanced digital solutions and compete with larger entities [27].\n\u2022 Escalating Cybersecurity Threats: As a consequence of digital transformation, a greater number of devices are being linked to the Internet, thereby augmenting the potential access points for cyberattacks. Assaults directed at critical infrastructure may lead to significant financial repercussions, harm to reputation, and even physical injury [70, 28].\n\u2022 Widening the digital divide: Digital transformation can exacerbate the digital gap by leaving behind people and communities who lack digital literacy or have restricted access to technology. This disparity impedes social and economic advancement and exacerbates existing inequalities [29].\n\u2022 Labour Displacement: The digital transformation of WDS should align with corporate social responsibility, addressing challenges like labor displacement caused by automation and AI. Organizations can mitigate job losses by fostering trust, equitable resource distribution, and social value through stakeholder engagement by introducing training and re-skilling programs to help workers transition to new roles. Integrating DT frameworks in water management advances technical efficiency, ethical stewardship, and workforce adaptability [12].\n\u2022 Privacy Issues: The significant collection and utilization of data have the potential to lead to privacy-related concerns. The implementation of digital technologies may be hindered by apprehensions regarding data security incidents or the handling of individual information, which could diminish public trust in these advancements [70, 69].\nWhile digital transformation provides great dividends in terms of productivity and, therefore, innovative capacity in various industries, it needs to be pursued strategically and with awareness within WDS.

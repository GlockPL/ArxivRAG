{"title": "Root Cause Attribution of Delivery Risks via Causal Discovery with Reinforcement Learning", "authors": ["Shi Bo", "Minheng Xiao"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In today's increasingly complex and interconnected global economy, supply chain management has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the success and competitiveness of businesses (Ketchen Jr et al., 2008). Effective management of supply chains is essential for improving customer satisfaction, optimizing productivity, and maintaining a competitive edge in the market. As businesses navigate the challenges of globalization and evolving geopolitical landscapes, they must prioritize the monitoring and analysis of customer delivery performance. By closely tracking delivery processes and analyzing relevant metrics, companies can gain valuable insights into their operations, identify areas for improvement, and proactively address issues before they escalate into significant disruptions (Christopher and Peck, 2004).\nSupply chain disruptions can have profound economic impacts, leading to delays in delivery and production as well as increased costs (Chopra and Sodhi, 2004). Understanding the root causes of these disruptions is"}, {"title": "1.1 Existing Works in Supply Chain on Delivery Risk", "content": "Most of the existing studies on delayed delivery risk have concentrated on the countermeasures implemented after the risk has materialized. For example, some approaches focus on ensuring delivery by optimizing production processes (Bi\u00e7er and Seifert, 2017; Chen et al., 2017) or by enhancing delivery strategies (Bushuev and Filatova, 2018; Shao and Tang, 2018).

Specifically,\n$X_{i} := f_{i}(x_{pa(i)}) + n_{i}, i = 1, 2, ..., d,$\nwhere $f_{i} (x_{pa(i)})$ represents the set of parent variables xj that have directed edges towards xi in the graph, and the noise terms ni are assumed to be jointly independent. We also assume causal minimality, which in this context implies that each function fi is non-constant in any of its arguments, as noted by (Peters et al., 2014).\nAs illustrated in Fig.(1), our proposed model consists of two parts: causal discovery via reinforcement learning and the calculation of inverse information entropy (IIE) causal strength (Mu et al., 2022).

This dataset is designed for analyzing and modeling various aspects of supply chain management provided by Kaggle. The dataset have 180520 samples and 53 features. Our aim is to find out the root cause of late delivery risk by analyzing the dataset by our causal discovery via reinforcement learning with strength caculation.\nFor the preprocessing of our dataset, we decided to begin by manually filtering out some variables that are less relevant to our specific problem, such as \"Order Date\", \"Order City\", and similar attributes. This step helps us focus on the most pertinent data, reducing noise and simplifying our analysis. After the initial manual filtering, we proceeded to check for multicollinearity among the remaining features. Multicollinearity can distort our model's predictions, as highly correlated features may carry redundant information. To address this, we removed features that exhibited high correlations with others, ensuring that each remaining feature contributes unique information to the model. Next, we transformed the categorical variables into numerical formats by encoding them as integers. This step was crucial for enabling the effective use of these variables in machine learning models, which typically require numerical input. Finally, after these preprocessing steps, we selected 16 key features that we identified as most relevant to our problem. These features will serve as the input for our models, providing a balanced and optimized dataset for analysis and predictive modeling.

This, in turn, significantly affects both the 'Days for shipment (scheduled) (X3) and directly influences the 'Late_delivery_risk' (X7), with strengths of 8.92 and 10.25, respectively.

The causal strength of 9.24 between shipping mode and actual shipping days underscores the critical importance of selecting the appropriate shipping method to minimize delays. By implementing our causal discovery approach, businesses could optimize their shipping strategies by prioritizing modes that reduce delivery times, thus mitigating the risk of late deliveries.

Our approach successfully identifies the primary factors contributing to late delivery risks, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides a framework for implementing targeted interventions to mitigate these risks. The ability to accurately map and understand the causal relationships within supply chains enables businesses to make informed decisions that enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\nFor future work, there are several avenues for future research and improvement. First, the uncertainty of calculation of causal strength can be further considered to ask questions, such as, how confident we are sure that there is a strong causal relationship between Xi and Xj. Then, the model could be fine-tuned to handle different types of data or to adjust for varying supply chain conditions, increasing its robustness across different industries such as economics, healthcare, or manufacturing. Additionally, experimenting with different scoring functions and hyperparameters in the reinforcement learning process could further enhance the accuracy of causal discovery. The methodology could also be extended to include multi-modal data inputs or adapted to real-time data streams, providing dynamic and responsive insights that evolve with changing conditions in the supply chain. Such advancements would broaden the applicability of our approach, making it a versatile tool for optimizing performance in various domains."}]}

Effective grid topology control requires advanced tools capable of handling multi-\nobjective trade-offs. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for tackling\nsuch challenges, existing Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) approaches fail to scale\nto the large state and action spaces inherent in real-world grid operations. Here we present a two-\nphase, efficient and scalable Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) method designed for grid topology\ncontrol, combining an efficient RL learning phase with a rapid planning phase to generate day-ahead\nplans for unseen scenarios.

Rapid electrification in industry, buildings, and transportation, combined with the integration of more\nrenewable energy sources often intermittent and geographically dispersed-pushes current infrastructures to their\nlimits [2]. These shifts lead to increased congestion, more complex maintenance, and higher operational costs. To\nnavigate such complexities, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need advanced decision-support tools capable of\ndynamically and efficiently optimising grid topologies.\nMulti-Objective Optimisation (MOO) is central to this endeavour, as TSOs often face several competing priorities\nsimultaneously. For example, they may strive to minimise transmission line loads, reduce the frequency of switching\nactions, or limit the topological complexity of the network [2]. Each of these objectives, which we will detail later, serves\nas an example of the diverse performance criteria that must be balanced. Meeting these objectives using conventional\nmethods can be computationally daunting, especially given the large action and state spaces associated with real-world\ngrids [2].\nReinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising framework for discovering effective strategies in such complex\nenvironments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. However, accommodating multiple objectives simultaneously remains a significant\nchallenge. Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms aim to address this by enabling agents to"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Electric Grid Representation. A power grid can be represented as an undirected graph G = (V, E), where V denotes\nthe set of nodes (substations) and E represents the set of edges (transmission lines). Each substation v \u2208 V is equipped\nwith two buses (A, B) to which transmission lines (e \u2208 E) can be connected. Referred to collectively as injections,\ngenerators and loads are directly connected to these buses. Part of the grid used in our experiments is depicted in Fig. 3\nin the Appendix. At any given time t, the total power generation must satisfy the total power demand across the grid,\nand each transmission line e \u2208 E has a thermal limit Pmax(e), beyond which the grid's stability may be compromised.\nTSOs continuously monitor the grid and execute remedial actions to maintain safe operational conditions. These actions\ninclude reconfiguring the grid topology at substations (e.g., switching lines between buses) and adjusting generator\noutputs.\nReinforcement Learning (RL). Power grid operations can be formulated as a sequential decision-making problem,\nwhere decisions are made at discrete time steps to optimise the grid's performance. At each time step t, the state of the\ngrid is represented by a set of variables collectively called the state st. These variables can include generators output,\nline flows, and other grid parameters. The operator selects an action at, such as altering substation configurations\nor redispatching generators, which transitions the grid to a new state St+1. In this work, we only consider grid\ntopology/configuration actions.\nRL provides a powerful framework to solve this sequential decision-making problem. In RL, an agent learns an optimal\npolicy \u03c0(at|st), which maps states to actions to maximise cumulative rewards over a time horizon. The reward r(st, at)\nis a scalar signal provided by the environment that quantifies the immediate benefit of taking a particular action in\na given state. By exploring different actions and evaluating the resulting rewards, the agent incrementally refines its\ndecision-making strategy. The optimisation objective for the RL agent can be expressed as: max \u0395 \u03a3\u03c4=0vtr (st, at)],\nwhere \u03b3\u2208 [0, 1] is a discount factor that balances immediate and future rewards. More details about RL can be found in\n[9].\nMulti-Objective Optimisation (MOO). In many real-world grid operation problems, multiple conflicting objectives\nmust be balanced simultaneously. For example, TenneT TSO in [2], considers the following objectives in power grid\nmanagement:"}, {"title": "3 Problem Formulation and Proposed Approach", "content": "3.1 Problem Formulation\nGiven a number of N consecutive timestamps T1, T2, ..., TsN, representing the day hours in our use case, the aim\nis to determine a strategy that assigns the grid topology to adopt at each timestamp. In this context, we use the terms\n\"strategy\" and \"plan\" interchangeably. The goal is twofold: (i) to optimise the maximum load flow under the N-1\ncontingency condition throughout the entire plan, denoted as max pn\u22121, and (ii) the frequency of topology changes\nwithin a plan (i.e., the number of times the current grid topology is changed), referred to as \"N switching\". These\ncorrespond to objectives (2) and (3) outlined in Section 2 respectively. With MOO, we seek to generate plans that\napproximate the PF, capturing various trade-offs between these two objectives.\n3.2 Multi-Objective Optimisation Approach\nOur approach overcomes the inefficiencies of state-of-the-art MORL algorithms, which arise from the extensive search\nspace required to explore multiple trade-offs during training in conjunction with large state and action spaces. To\naddress this issue, we adopt a two-phase methodology that separates RL training and planning.\nPhase 1: Training an RL Agent In the first phase, we train an RL agent to optimise a utility reward function\u00b9 that\nencapsulates the objectives of interest, specified to reflect the importance of each objective and to optimise a pre-defined\ntrade-off among them.\nPhase 2: Plan Generation using Single-Step Planning (SSP) In the second phase, the trained RL agent is deployed\nto generate a set of non-dominated set\u00b2 of plans that form an approximation of the PF. First, the agent is deployed at\neach timestamp by observing the state of the grid and generating the grid topology to adopt based on the learned policy.\nThe generated topology is supposed to optimise both objectives defined in subsection 3.1. Second, for each value of \"N\nswitching\" objective, which takes discrete values, the plan generation algorithm seeks to find the plan that achieves\nthe best possible value of N-1 load objective. For example, when \"N switching\" = 1, the algorithm searches for the\nspecific timestamp to change the grid topology (as recommended by the agent) to optimise the N-1 load objective over\nthe entire plan. This process is repeated for all other values of \"N switching\", which typically range from 1 to 24. The\nalgorithm filters the generated plans by eliminating dominated solutions, leaving a refined set that represents the PF\napproximation. A structured description of the algorithm is given in Alg. 1 in the Appendix.\n3.3 Our methods\nFor phase 1, we propose two distinct RL agents, while phase 2 remains consistent across all experiments.\nSingle-Step Agent (SSA) SSA is trained to act on each timestamp independently. For a timestamp Tsi, the agent\ndecides which topology Topoi to put in place by sequentially acting on different substations. The agent is rewarded\nonly at the end of the episode, once the final topology is formed. The reward, is provided only in the final state, and is\ndefined as: R (SF) = w1 \u00d7 R1 + W2 \u00d7 R2 + w3 \u00d7 R3, where:"}, {"title": "3.4 Baselines", "content": "The following baselines are used for comparison:\nReference Strategy: Place all transmission lines on bus A at every substation for all timestamps.\nExpert Strategy 1: Adopt a fixed operator topology that changes only substation 0 to reroute power flows towards a\ntargeted substation.

Our findings confirm the\npotential of RL for optimising power grid operations, as highlighted in prior literature. Building on this foundation,\nwe introduced a multi-objective approach that generates an efficient approximation of the PF for optimising multiple\nobjectives.\nThe proposed approach involves a two-phase process: first, training an RL agent to learn an optimal policy for a\npredefined utility function with the ability to handle the complex grids; then, employing a multi-objective optimisation\nplanning algorithm to approximate the PF. This approach yields strong qualitative results, outperforming expert solutions,\nwith inference time reduced to just a few minutes, making it well-suited for practical, real-world day-ahead planning,\nwhere computational efficiency is critical.\nWhile this work focused on optimising two objectives, the framework can be extended to include additional objectives.\nFor instance, the topological depth objective (objective (4) in Section 2) could be incorporated by conditioning the\nRL policy on the discrete specific values of topological depth. The planning algorithm could then generate distinct\nsolutions conditioned on these values, producing an approximation of the PF for each specified topological depth. By\nmerging these individual Pareto Fronts and applying PF filtering, a global PF could be derived.\nAnother compelling direction for future work is to generate diverse plans that represent the same point on the PF. This\nwould offer operators a wider range of options, empowering them to choose solutions tailored to particular operational\nneeds or situational constraints."}, {"title": "A Appendix", "content": "A.1 Number of switching timestamps results\nFig. 4 shows the \"N switching\" objective average for the best plans achieving the highest max pn-1 presented in the\nresults section.

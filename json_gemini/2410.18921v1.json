Today, her friend gave her 3 more cookies. How many cookies does Lily have now?\" Many large language models (LLMs) in previous research approach this problem by calculating the answer \u201c1\u201d using the equation \"3 - 5 + 3.\" However, from a human perspective, we recognize the inherent flaw in this problem: Lily cannot eat 5 cookies if she initially only had 3. This dis- crepancy prompts a key question: Are current LLMs merely BLIND SOLVER that apply mathematical operations without deeper reasoning, or can they function as LOGICAL THINKER capable of identifying logical inconsistencies?\nTo explore this question, we propose a benchmark dataset, FAULTYMATH, which includes faulty math problems of rich diversity: i) multiple mathematical cate- gories, e.g., algebra, geometry, number theory, etc., ii) varying levels of diffi- culty, and iii) different origins of faultiness-ranging from violations of common sense and ambiguous statements to mathematical contradictions and more. We evaluate a broad spectrum of LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and math-specialized models, using FAULTYMATH across three dimensions: (i) How accurately can the models detect faulty math problems without being explicitly prompted to do so? (ii) When provided with hints\u2014either correct or mislead- ing-about the validity of the problems, to what extent do LLMs adapt to become reliable LOGICAL THINKER? (iii) How trustworthy are the explanations gener- ated by LLMs when they recognize a math problem as flawed? Through extensive experimentation and detailed analysis, our results demonstrate that existing LLMs largely function as BLIND SOLVER and fall short of the reasoning capabilities required to perform as LOGICAL THINKER.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Our exploration begins with the example presented in Figure 1, where a logically flawed math prob- lem still leads prominent large language models (LLMs) to produce various numerical answers. This outcome is surprising, as we would expect an intelligent AI system not only to provide correct solutions to valid math problems but also to identify when a problem is logically inconsistent and therefore should not yield any answer, even without explicit hints about its flawed nature. This ob- servation prompts us to re-examine the current development trajectory of LLMs for mathematical problem-solving (Ahn et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2021a; Imani et al., 2023), which generally assume that the provided math problems are valid and require only computational solutions, without considering the possibility of logical flaws. This raises a crucial question: Are contemporary LLMs merely BLIND SOLVER that execute mathematical operations without deeper reasoning, or can they evolve into LOGICAL THINKER capable of detecting logical inconsistencies?\nTo address this question, we introduce a new dataset, FAULTYMATH, which incorporates three di- mensions of diversity: (i) a range of mathematical categories, including algebra, geometry, number theory, etc., (ii) varying levels of difficulty, and (iii) a rich variety of falsehoods, such as violations of common sense, insufficient information, mathematical contradictions, etc.\nThe creation of FAULTYMATH was a multi-step process. Initially, we recruited participants from the American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) to manually generate faulty math problems. However, this led to a dataset that was disproportionately skewed toward specific mathematical categories and types of logical flaws. To create a more balanced and comprehensive dataset, we developed a three- stage pipeline: (i) We used GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) to modify valid problems from the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) into flawed ones, generating 2,000 potential faulty math problems; (ii) we then prompted GPT-4 to perform self-evaluation, identifying 635 of these as likely faulty; (iii) finally, human annotators reviewed these problems, confirming 363 as genuinely faulty.\nWe conducted an extensive evaluation on FAULTYMATH using ten popular LLMs, including both open-source, closed-source, and math-specialized models, to assess their capacity to function as LOGICAL THINKER. Our evaluation focused on three key aspects: (i) Without any hints, how effectively can LLMs recognize that a given math problem is faulty? Unfortunately, even the best- performing model, Gemini 1.5 Pro, identified only 33.33% of the faulty problems successfully. (ii) When provided with hints-either factually correct or misleading ones, how reliably do LLMs be- have as LOGICAL Thinker? Our results indicate that factually correct hints about the problem's faultiness significantly improve performance, but models still fall short of perfection. Moreover, LLMs demonstrated vulnerability to misleading hints, with models like Gemini and GPT-4 exhibit- ing confirmational bias when influenced by incorrect hints. (iii) How accurate are the explanations generated by LLMs when they correctly identify a faulty problem? Our findings reveal that mod- els such as Gemini and Qwen-1.5 consistently produced correct explanations when they recognized falsehoods, highlighting their ability to articulate reasoning effectively in such cases.\nIn summary, this study advocates for the development of LLMs that go beyond mere BLIND SOLVER and evolve into true LOGICAL THINKER. The key contributions of this paper are threefold:\n\u2022 We identify the critical gap in LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities, highlighting the need to shift from BLIND SOLVER to LOGICAL THINKER.\n\u2022 We introduce FAULTYMATH, a balanced dataset comprising 363 faulty math problems, specifically designed to evaluate this aspect of LLM performance.\n\u2022 Through extensive analysis, we provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and lim- itations of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning and their capacity to detect logical inconsistencies."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Mathematical problem-solving has long been a significant area of AI research.

Our initial approach involved enlisting American high school math competition (AMC) participants to create faulty math problems from scratch. However, this effort resulted in a problem set that is biased toward particular mathematical categories and specific types of falsehoods. We then explored data augmentation via LLMs, using this seed dataset cre- ated by high-school students, but this approach also failed. Inspired by recent studies on generating synthetic data using LLMs (Lou et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2023), we extensively experimented with modifying valid problems from the MATH dataset using GPT-4 by giving it well-crafted prompts."}, {"title": "3.1 FAULTYMATH CURATION", "content": "Valid to Raw Faulty Math Problem. To compile a diverse collection of faulty math problems across different categories (e.g., Algebra, Geometry), we used the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) as our source for valid problems. We selected 400 problems from each of five cat- egories-Algebra, Geometry, Counting & Probability, Number Theory, and Precalculus-totaling 2,000 valid problems. Given its creativity and strong performance on the MATH dataset, we chose GPT-4 as our LLM for this stage.\nWe provided GPT-4 with each valid math problem and its correct solution, instructing it to\n\u2022 convert the problem into a false and unsolvable version, and\n\u2022 generate a brief explanation of why the problem is faulty\u2014a crucial step that significantly improved the generation of genuinely faulty problems.\nLLM Self-Filtering. We found that many of the 2,000 generated false math problems were actu- ally solvable, so we implemented a self-verification process to filter out those that did not meet the criteria for being truly unsolvable.\nIn this self-evaluation process, GPT-4 was initially presented with a \u201craw false math problem\u201d to solve. After providing a solution, it was prompted with a \u201csimple explanation\" of why the problem was unsolvable, encouraging GPT-4 to reflect on its initial solution. Finally, we posed a multiple- choice question to GPT-4, asking for its final decision on the entire conversation. The choices (A, B, or C) are outlined in Figure 2.\nIf GPT-4 outputs \"A\", it implies that GPT-4 believes the raw faulty math problem to be a genuine faulty math problem but not a challenging one to identify. If GPT-4 outputs \"B\", it implies that GPT-4 considered the raw faulty math problem to be a genuine false math problem and a challenging one that it could not identify to be false when initially presented. An output of \u201cC\u201d implies that the false math problem is a valid math problem with a possible solution.\nWe filtered out the problems marked \"C\" and \"A,\u201d as they had a lower likelihood of being genuine and challenging false math problems. This left us with 635 problems.\nHuman Verification. The remaining 635 math problems were then reviewed by human annotators for verification. Each annotator independently assessed all 635 problems to determine whether they were genuinely false, meaning no solution existed as presented. Through this manual verification process, 363 problems were confirmed as genuine false math problems by both annotators. The other 272 problems were found to be solvable and were discarded."}, {"title": "3.2 FAULTYMATH STATISTICS.", "content": "Figure 3 (left) illustrates the distribution of false math problems across various mathematical cate- gories, demonstrating GPT-4's balanced capability in generating false math problems for each cat- egory. A notable trend within the dataset is the prevalence of higher-difficulty problems, indicating that more complex math problems are more likely to mislead GPT-4 when transformed into false problems.\nTo understand the origins of errors in FAULTYMATH, we randomly selected 50 samples and manu- ally classified the types of falsehoods. Subsequently, we used GPT-40 to systematically categorize each false problem into these predetermined categories. As shown in Figure 3 (right), the analysis reveals that Mathematical Contradiction and Invalidity are the most common types of errors gen- erated by GPT-4. This trend suggests that the model tends to introduce these specific errors during the problem conversion process because these two types are easier to construct and are applicable across various problems. Additionally, these types of errors are more likely to be retained as they effectively challenge the model's problem-solving accuracy. In contrast, errors such as Common Sense Violation, Misleading Statements, and Undefined Terms occur less frequently, showcasing the model's preferences in generating false math problems. The analysis highlights the model's ability to generate complex false problems and its tendency towards certain types of errors, showcasing both the strengths and preferences of the model."}, {"title": "4 EVALUATION METHOD", "content": "The primary task for LLMs in this research is to determine whether they can identify issues in given false math problems. However, directly asking this question would signal to the LLMs that the problem is false, thereby influencing their response. The same constraint applies to human annotators; we cannot explicitly ask whether the questions are false. Instead, we ask them to solve the problems without providing any hints. By analyzing their solutions, we can determine whether the falsehood was detected. For instance, if a solution mentions that the problem is solvable only with additional constraints, it indicates awareness of the issue. Consequently, evaluating the LLMs' responses to false math problems requires careful and nuanced assessment.\nTo tackle this challenge, we sought to develop an accurate automated evaluator using an LLM, designed to closely align with human assessments. We first established a gold standard by having two PhD-level reviewers evaluate responses from GPT-4-Turbo (2024-04-09 Update) on the dataset. The reviewers found that GPT-4-Turbo failed to identify issues in 300 of the 363 genuine false math problems, achieving a gold-standard accuracy of 17.36% (63 out of 363 identified). We then tested different auto-evaluation prompts with two other LLMs, GPT-4 and GPT-40, comparing their performance against the gold standard. We use LLM, to denote the LLM to be evaluated (i.e., the problem solver) and LLMe to denote the LLM as an evaluator.\nAuto-Evaluation Prompts. For the automatic evaluation with LLMe, we tried the following prompting techniques:\n\u2022 Simple Prompt: Problem X: ['False Math Problem'] LLM Y's Solution: ['LLM Solution'] Problem X is a false math problem and cannot be solved without modifications to the problem statement. Did LLM Y identify this in its solution? Please answer 'Yes' or 'No'.\n\u2022 Simple Prompt + Explanation: Insert \"Why Problem X is a False and Unsolvable Math: ['Simple Explanation']\" right after the LLM Y's Solution.\n\u2022 Chain-of-thought prompt: Provide one positive and one negative example, and explain step by step how the LLM Y identified or missed the falsehood of the math problem. Here, instead of answering \"yes\" or \"no\" directly, we prompted it to reason, and finally answer."}, {"title": "5 EXPERIMENTS", "content": "5.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nLarge Language Models (i.e., LLMs). In this work, we evaluate three categories of state-of- the-art LLMs, known for their mathematical problem-solving abilities, with the goal of ensuring a comprehensive and representative assessment."}, {"title": "5.2 RESULTS AND ANALYSES", "content": "We try to answer the following five questions to better understand the behavior of various LLMs on FAULTYMATH.\nQ1: How do the LLMs perform on FAULTYMATH without any hints or with hints? We report them separately as follows.\nWhen hints are not provided, Table 2 (w/o hints) highlights that the Gemini-1.5-Pro model out- performed others, correctly identifying 33.33% false problems in FAULTYMATH. Following closely were GPT-4, Qwen-1.5, and Claude-3, each demonstrating strong performance. However, mod- els such as Llama-3, Yi-1.5, and the two math-specialized LLMs, Deepseek-Math-7B-RL and Internlm2-Math-20B, significantly underperformed in this challenge.\nBy comparing performance on FAULTYMATH with that on the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), which consists of valid math questions, we find that strong results on general math datasets do not necessarily correlate with high effectiveness in identifying faulty math problems. This sug- gests that solving the faulty problems in FAULTYMATH requires deeper reasoning and critical think- ing than solving the general mathematical problems.\nWhen provided hints, we conduct this experiment where, in one round, we provide a factually correct hint to the LLM that the problem can be a false and unsolvable math problem, and in an- other round, we provide a misleading hint that the problem is a valid and solvable math problem whereas they are not. From Table 2 (w/ hints), we can infer that while LLMs score high when it has true hints, they get easily misled by the false hints. The LLMs in this experiment exhibited high confirmational bias, where they agreed to the instruction easily, without rationalizing and reaching a different conclusion.\nQ2: What types and origins of faulty math questions pose the greatest challenges for LLMs? We begin by analyzing the factor related to the type of math problem, followed by an analysis of the factor concerning the origin of the faultiness.\n\u2022 Analysis by difficulty level and mathematical category\nWe conducted an in-depth analysis of the fine-grained accuracy of the top three performing LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4, Qwen1.5) across various difficulty levels (ranging from level 1 to level 5) and mathematical categories (such as Algebra, Counting & Probability, etc.), as illustrated in Figure 4.\nFrom the average accuracy of the top three LLMs (top-left), it is evident that the performance in identifying false math problems is slightly higher for simpler to moderately difficult problems (lev- els 1-3) compared to more challenging ones (levels 4-5). Particularly, compared to GPT-4 and Qwen1.5, Gemini exhibits a notable strength in this aspect. When evaluating by mathematical cate- gory, Algebra demonstrates the highest accuracy, followed by Number Theory, with Geometry being the most challenging, evidenced by an average accuracy of only 23%.\nA comparative analysis of the performance of the top three LLMs in different mathematical cate- gories reveals varied strengths among the models. Gemini excels in Algebra and Number Theory,"}, {"title": "Q3: How does LLM performance compare to human performance on FAULTYMATH without any hints?", "content": "To answer this question, we recruited 15 graduate-level students to participate in our study. For this human benchmarking stage, we needed to ensure that the human participants did not get any hints that the problems were false math problems to keep their responses unbiased. The participants were provided with the false math questions and asked to write down their responses. Each participant was given 10 problems from our dataset to solve within 72 hours. They were strictly prohibited from using any AI tools. The participants were asked to solve 10 problems, not all 363 problems, for two main reasons. Firstly, to reduce their effort and prevent fatigue-induced errors. Secondly, to prevent students from identifying that there is a prominent pattern (all mathematical questions are false and unsolvable) in the questions they were facing. The students' responses were manually evaluated by the same evaluators that evaluated GPT-4's responses in our auto evaluation- method step to keep the evaluation consistent.\nWe observed an average accuracy of 21.33% in identifying false math problems by the human par- ticipants. This performance is 1.6% higher than the average of our 10 LLMs, which is 19.72% (table 2). Even though the performance gap is small, it suggests that this task is comparatively easier for human beings than LLMs. However, we also need to address that this is not an apple-to-apple com- parison. LLMs were solving one problem at a time whereas the human participants had 10 questions to sense a pattern of falsehood. Due to input-window limitation, we cannot expect LLMs to reason through even two questions in many cases, let alone 10. On the other hand, a single LLM, arguably, has in its possession more mathematical knowledge than a graduate-level student; what we have observed is the failure to reason from them better than humans."}, {"title": "Q4: How do the LLMs react when they are asked to simply output \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d?", "content": "Traditional NLP tasks evaluate systems based on explicit task instructions, where the system knows the evaluation criteria. For example, in machine-translation tasks, if the instruction is to translate \"Gracias\" from Spanish to German, a correct response would be \"Danke.\" In contrast, if the instruc- tion changes to: \u201cTranslate the following English to German: \u2018Gracias\u201d, a correct response would clarify that \"Gracias\u201d is Spanish, not English, and then provide the German equivalent, \u201cDanke.\" Essentially, evaluating the system based on the acknowledgement of the underlying issue in the task instruction is something novel we have done in our primary experiment, Q1. We can consider Q1 as an \"Evaluation-unaware\" experiment where the system is not aware of the falsehood in the task instruction and not aware that it will be evaluated based on the identification of such falsehood. For Q4, we want to test what happens when the system is aware of the possibility of the falsehood.\nThe prompt for this \"Evaluation-aware\" experiment was \u201cIs the above math problem a false and unsolvable math problem? Output 'Yes' if it is, 'No' otherwise.\". Since LLMs tend to have a bias towards always outputting \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo,\u201d we flipped the statement to force the LLMs to choose logically in another round of experiments with the following prompt. \"Is the above math problem a valid and solvable math problem? Output 'Yes' if it is, 'No' otherwise.\u201d Notice how, for the same sample in the dataset, we expect the LLM to respond in \"Yes\" in one and \u201cNo\u201d in another.\nThe results are detailed in Table 3. We can observe that, the contrast between switching \"Yes\" and \"No\" is very high in some LLMs. This adds to the notion that some of the LLMs have a high bias towards selecting \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d and their mathematical reasoning capacity without step-by-step generative approach is very weak."}, {"title": "Q5: How accurate are the explanations provided by LLMs when identifying false math problems?", "content": "To deepen our understanding beyond binary performance evaluation, we investigate the correctness of LLMs' explanations when they identify a math problem as false. Specifically, we selected the top three LLMs and examined 21 samples, which all three LLMs correctly identified as false. Our analysis involved two rounds of manual verification. The first round ensured that all se- lected samples were indeed correctly identified as false, and the second round focused on assessing the correctness of the explanations provided. Our findings revealed that both Gemini and Qwen1.5 provided accurate explanations for all 21 samples (21/21), while GPT-4 offered correct explanations for 20 out of 21 samples (20/21).

Set up the equation:\nLet the first even number be represented by 2n (where n is any integer). - The next consecutive even number is 2n + 2. - The problem states: $(2n + 2)^2 \u2013 (2n)^2 = 58$\n2. Simplify and solve the equation:\nExpand the squares: $4n^2 + 8n + 4 - 4n^2 = 58$ - Simplify: $8n + 4 = 58$ - Subtract 4 from both sides: $8n = 54$ - Divide both sides by 8: $n = 6.75$\n3. The problem:\nWe defined n as an integer", "conditions.\nConclusion": "The problem is unsolvable. There is no pair of consecutive even numbers whose squares have a difference of 58.\nCLAUDE-3-OPUS: IDENTIFIED\nLet's approach this step by step:\n1) Let's assume the two consecutive even numbers are n and n + 2.\n2) The problem states that the difference of their squares is 58. We can express this as an equation:\n$(n + 2)^2 \u2013 n^2 = 58$\n3) Let's expand the squares:\n$(n^2 + 4n + 4) \u2013 n^2 = 58$\n4) Simplify:\n$4n + 4 = 5"}]}

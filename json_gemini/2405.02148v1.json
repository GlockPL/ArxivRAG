To the same end, we explore Formal Learning Theory in the context of creativity. We provide an introduction to the main concepts of this framework and a re-interpretation of terms commonly found in creativity discussions, proposing formal definitions for novelty and transformational creativity. This formalisation marks the beginning of a research branch we call Formal Creativity Theory, exploring how learning can be included as preparation for exploratory behaviour and how learning is a key part of transformational creative behaviour. By employing these definitions, we argue that, while novelty is neither necessary nor sufficient for transformational creativity in general, when using an inspiring set, rather than a sequence of experiences, an agent actually requires novelty for transformational creativity to occur.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Since its origins in the 1960s, the theory known as the Formal Learning Theory (FLT) was motivated by the task of providing natural language capabilities to machines. It has equally been used to explore long-lasting debates on children's intellectual development or even to structure philosophical fields such as epistemology. It is a nonstatistical research stem within Computational Learning Theory (CLT) which facilitates the examination of limitations pertaining to learning under theoretical conditions, such as infinite data, time, and space. As such, both language acquisition and scientific discovery are traditionally employed and vastly explored for the purpose of illustrating and inspiring FLT.\nSome authors, such as Koestler (2014), argue that creativity has a major role in tasks like language acquisition and scientific discovery, often seen solely as learning. However, others find this hard to accept, as Ritchie (2007, p. 69) suggests: \"Mathematics, science, or engineering are rarely classed as creative unless they are done exceptionally well. This bias does not seem helpful in a rigorous attempt to pin down the notion of creativity, particularly when applied to machines. Although there is still a tendency within AI to tacitly accept this intellectual apartheid of creative versus non-creative activities, it would be better if we could be more neutral in our formal characterisation of creative actions.\"\nWe believe that some ideas in FLT could have a useful purpose for creativity studies, especially in structuring and formalizing matters. Our exploration of this theory is an attempt at formalizing concepts in Computational Creativity (CC), following a series of similar attempts that are based on other theoretical fields such as: the early developments by Wallas (1926), Rhodes (1961) and Guilford (1950); Boden's (1994) ideas and their subsequent examination by others such as Bundy (1994) and Ritchie (2006); Wiggins' (2019) progress at bringing extra rigour to Boden's (2004) proposal; Schmidhuber's (2010) project to formalise creativity; Colton, Charnley, and Pease's (2011) proposal of Computational Creativity Theory; Ventura's (2011) adaptation of the \"No Free Lunch Theorem\"; Shannon's Information Theory use by Varshney (2019, 2020) and the approach to Kolmogorov Complexity by Mondol and Brown (2021).\nIn this paper, our goal is three-fold: 1) to introduce the ideas behind FLT; 2) to provide formal definitions for some creativity-related terminology, inspired in FLT; 3) to show how these formal definitions allow to explore and demonstrate results about creativity, by exploring the effective role of novelty in transformational creativity (Boden, 2004)."}, {"title": "The Endless Explanation of \u201cGrey Music\"", "content": "In this section, we present an anecdote, a scenario, that sets the stage for our explanation of FLT, by illustrating the foundational concepts within the context of a creative domain and highlighting some important aspects. Since FLT is agnostic and applicable across domains, this anecdote could pertain to any creative domain and still illustrate the theory as effectively. Besides, adapting it for other domains should be easily achievable. We chose the music domain and titled our anecdote: The Endless Explanation of \u201cGrey Music\".\nOur story begins with a vinyl shop assistant and his client\u00b9, as they embark on a journey around a musical genre known as grey music, in a world where intensional definitions are avoided.

We call the collection of such definitions and results, FLT, which we now introduce. In this introduction, we reproduce a slight adaptation of some of the content in the comprehensive review of FLT made available by Jain et al. (1999). For the sake of clarity and ease of reference, we decided to compile this set of definitions under a common name: Scientist Identifying Languages in Texts (SILIT).

We will use P to denote the set of all those possible programs. Within our notation, $W_p$ signifies the domain of the computable function expressed by program p.

This framework as well as its variations are different ways to formalise the five components that we find in any empirical inquiry paradigm. Similarly to many other ideas in the theory of computation, the terminology revolves around languages and sentences, to directly model language acquisition.\nWe will start by formalizing the class of possible realities, whose formalisation was directly borrowed from computability theory. Since the learner must be able to point at specific sets of things, for example, songs or sentences, one way is to allow our learner to produce intrinsical definitions for those sets. Using programs we can actually have a finite representation for potentially infinite sets. Thus, in this framework, a possible reality is a r.e. set, also designated as a language, L \u2208 E.

In this framework, a grammar, a hypothesis or a conjecture is a program, p\u0404P.\n(b) Language corresponds to a grammar. A language L is said to correspond to a grammar p if and only if L = $W_p$.\nWe address now how this framework models the data collected from one specific fixed reality. To faithfully emulate this way of learning, we must ensure that the learner only accesses the correct reality indirectly through extensional data, i.e., we need to model the learner conundrum by creating a singular interface between the learner and the correct reality.\nOne simple way to represent data is to consider an infinite sequence of positive examples encompassing all members of the set \u2013 an exhaustive representative dataset. In this area, this list-like representation of all the elements of a set is termed as 'text', since this would correspond to an actual text with all the sentences that could be written in a language. In the same way, the words in a text do not change based on what a reader is thinking, this structure is also independent of what the learner is outputting and may include repetitions or even blank spaces, points of null data.

Then, L is said identifiable in case there is a scientist that identifies it; it is said to be unidentifiable otherwise.\nSeveral critical observations regarding this definition of identification need to be considered. Firstly, it is crucial to notice that, according to the definition, to identify a language, L, the scientist needs only to identify all the texts for the given language, without restrictions about what happens in other texts. Thus, in FLT, only the identifiability of classes of languages is worth discussing, since discussing the identifiability of singular languages is rendered superfluous, as every given single language L \u2208 & is trivially identified by at least one scientist: the scientist that regardless of its input constantly outputs p\u2208 P, such that p is the smallest grammar for L. We will name such a scientist a dumb visionary (Def 6). Such broad definitions expand the ideas of both \"learner\" and \"learning\" to include these very dumb or stubborn behaviours, which becomes very useful to prove results but obviously raises criticism against this framework in what concerns its fidelity and capacity to model real learning behaviour. The field addresses these criticisms by extending the framework, redefining one or more of these components while being guided by already proven results."}, {"title": "Definition 6 - Dumb Visionary.", "content": "Given a language L, the dumb visionary for L, written $DV_L$, is defined as the scientist that, regardless of its input, constantly outputs the minimum program p \u2208 P such that $W_p$ = L.\nOne simple interesting result from the FLT field is that scientists that can be agnostic about the time they have converged, i.e., they are not imposed to announce their convergence, can identify more classes of languages than those imposed to announce their convergence. This and other intriguing results could be proved within this framework, yet in this text, we need to move on to discussing this theory inside the context of CC.

We shortly introduce some concepts from the canonical literature of CC, and what we consider could be their formal reinterpreted definition under the lens of FLT. Some of these terms are essentially renames of structures from FLT.

While both the first and third are used to distinguish artefacts that belong to a specific conceptual space or those that are valuable, respectively, the second one provides an ordered sequence of artefacts. In SILIT, the notion of hypothesis corresponds to the implicit representation of a language. Seems appropriate, then, to correspond such sets of rules to hypotheses (Def 14), despite some being used to decide and others to enumerate.

Conversely, in CC literature, it is a common but not exclusive viewpoint that a creative act is characterized by a process yielding creative artefacts. Therefore, many of the efforts in CC wander around artefacts and their properties. Several have then been the properties proposed as desiderata to discern creative artefacts, such as novelty, typicality, value, quality or even surprise.\nWe propose to include 'property extensions' to FCT as a new extension type. This new kind of extension enables the creation of new paradigms, by constraining the class of scientists based on these properties, or just by employing different criteria that define success based on such properties.

Similarly to Wiggins' (2006) dichotomic evaluation rules, \u019013, this simple implementation allows for only two states of value: valuable artefacts and non-valuable artefacts. Despite facilitating theory, this simplicity-driven design choice can raise criticism, since our findings may not apply to alternative rating schema models that might be more accurate.

Yet, a set of rules for a conceptual space can always be used to build a schema. In this study, we decided to focus on schemas parameterized by an experience and a scientist.

This means that the scientist can access the true value of this schema. This is not true for all schemas, as there are schemas that can only be approximated by the scientists, which will be the case for the next schema. Since our model of these schemas is parameterized, we can see that novelty is not intrinsic to an artefact, it depends on the experience provided to a scientist. It makes no sense then to evaluate this predicate out of the context of a specific situation."}, {"title": "Transformativeness", "content": "Following Boden's (2004) proposal of different kinds of creativity - exploratory, combinational and transformational creativity - more common than not, research in CC is influenced by the \"widely discussed proposal by Boden that high levels of creativity result from the transformation of a conceptual space\u201d (Ritchie, 2006, p. 242). Wiggins (2019, p. 31) paraphrases Boden's transformational creativity as \"the kind of creative behaviour concerned (...) with transforming the rule set\" that defines a conceptual space.\nThe interplay between transformational creativity and learning is inherently complex and deeply interconnected. Through analyzing hypothetical scenarios of creative behaviour, we identified two main cases for the relationship between learning and creativity: one where learning precedes exploration, akin to the preparation phase described by Wallas (1926); and another where learning occurs during exploration, aligning with what Wiggins (2019) describes as transformational creativity. When analyzing real cases, distinguishing when exploration begins and preparation ends become subjective, so one can only differentiate transformational creativity from well-prepared exploratory creativity by fixing a starting point for the exploration process.\nGeneralizing Wiggins' (2019) idea of transformational creativity as changing an intentional representation, and relating it to how scientists learn in FLT, we say that transformational creativity happens whenever a scientist changes their hypothesis in a growing experience. Formally, we observe transformational creativity if a scientist outputs $h_1$ from experience \u03c3\u2081, and then generates a different hypothesis $h_2$ when undergoing $\u03c3_1 \u25ca a$.

The common way to study this aspect then became to study what makes a product novel and find search strategies that could increase the likelihood of novelty. Yet, one other aspect of novelty we can study, given these new definitions, is its relationship with other properties such as transformativeness. We aim to study how experiencing novel artefacts affects learning or, in our case, how it affects creativity namely how necessary it is for transformational creativity (Boden, 2004). It is unspokenly assumed that novelty is needed for transformational creativity to happen. This is yet another reason for novelty being valued in creativity because novel artefacts are assumed to impact conceptual models. We prove here that if we consider the general class of scientists, it is wrong to assume that there is a relationship between novelty and the transformation of conceptual spaces! We prove that, in this wide class of agents, there is no such relationship and we illustrate the results using examples. We then show that for a sub-class of scientists, it is correct to assume such a relationship.\nNovelty is not sufficient for Transformativeness\nCould it be that all pieces of novel information will always make one change their mind? In this framework, we can define scientists that defy such assumption. Actually, we have infinitely many scientists that break such statement, some very trivial, others more complex."}, {"title": "Theorem 1.", "content": "Artefact a being novel in situation s does not imply a is transformative in that same situation.\nProof. We will provide a situation s and an artefact a such that a is novel but not transformative in situation s. Suppose $M_h$ is a constant scientist, i.e., there is constant h\u2208 N, such that for every \u03c3\u2208 SEQ, \u039c(\u03c3) = h. An example of such kind of scientists is what we defined as dumb visionaries $DV_A$ (Def 6). Now, suppose a situation s = (\u039c\u03b7, \u03c3) with a fixed \u03c3 \u2208 SEQ. Suppose as well any artefact a such that a & $I_\u03c3$. Such a must exist since I is always finite due to the finitude of \u03c3, i.e., independently of the chosen experience there is always at least one novel artefact. By definition, we see that the chosen a is novel in s, yet M(\u03c3) = h = \u039c(\u03c3\u25ca \u03b1), hence a is not transformative.\nAs this proof shows, we showcase scientists for whom novelty alone is insufficient to alter their ideas. Even though these seem very simple scientists, we can build more complex scientists that would prove such a theorem, such as any scientist who identifies an infinite language. If novelty was sufficient to make any scientist change their opinion, then any fate for an infinite platonic conceptual space would have infinite points of transformation and therefore no scientist could ever identify it. Yet, we think the simple scientists provided in the proof illustrate well the argument in point, since despite their triviality these simple scientists still identify one platonic conceptual space. We can compare these to people with unjustified beliefs who are immune to any kind of evidence, yet can be, by chance, right in some cases/realities, and that despite novelty they will never change their beliefs."}, {"title": "Novelty is not necessary for Transformativeness", "content": "Maybe even more surprising is that, within these definitions, novelty is also not required for transformativeness. Transformativeness can occur in situations and artefacts that fail to meet the novelty criterion."}, {"title": "Theorem 2.", "content": "Artefact a being transformative in situation s does not imply a is novel in that same situation.\nProof. In this case, we need to provide a situation s and an artefact a such that a is transformative but not novel in situation s. Suppose M' is an ever-changing scientist, i.e., \u039c\u0384(\u03c3) \u2260 \u039c\u0384 (\u03c3 \u25ca b) for every \u03c3and b. An example of such a scientist is a scientist whose output depends only on the size of the experience, such as M\u0384(\u03c3) = |\u03c3| Suppose a situation s = (\u039c', \u03c3) for fixed \u03c3\u2208 SEQ but $I_\u03c3$ \u2260 0. Let us choose an artefact such that a \u2208 $I_\u03c3$. We see that the chosen a is not novel, because we explicitly chose something that was already experienced by the scientist, yet our scientist changes always their hypothesis when his experience grows so \u039c(\u03c3) \u2260 \u039c(\u03c3\u25ca \u03b1) hence a is transformative.\nOnce again, these are very trivial scientists. These, contrary to the constant ones, are actually not able to identify anything. A more complex and more realistic example to prove such a result would be a scientist that annotates how confident it is in its hypotheses by appending a comment to the hypotheses. If the artefact matched its hypotheses then it would increase the confidence by one point, otherwise it would decrease the confidence or even make it change completely if confidence reached zero. Such scientist is by definition ever-changing and therefore also proves the theorem above, for syntactic transformativeness. This scientist can converge semantically and can be used to identify using an expansion to the identification criterion previously presented - behaviourally correct identification."}, {"title": "For Set-Driven Scientists, Novelty is necessary for Trans"}]}

Each of these phases is discussed next."}, {"title": "3.1 Awareness for Leadership", "content": "Management support is often a key enabler of successful adoption of an initiative in a company\n(Hsu et al., 2018; Kurup & Gupta, 2022). Therefore, the first step should be to educate and engage\nleadership on the potential and impact of artificial intelligence (AI). Cultivating a comprehensive\nunderstanding among leadership can ensure strategic alignment and secure commitment to AI\ninitiatives.\n\nTo achieve this objective, workshops and seminars for leadership teams should be organized.\nThese can play a crucial role, as awareness of technology significantly drives its adoption (Subedi\net al., 2009). Such sessions should provide an extensive overview of AI technologies, covering the\nbasics, current trends, and future possibilities. The aim should be to demystify AI for executives\nto help them understand what it has to offer.\n\nSharing success stories and case studies from similar industries can help demonstrate the practical\napplications and benefits of AI. These real-world examples enable leaders to visualize how AI can\nbe effectively applied within their own organization. Moreover, case studies and success stories\ncan create memetic isomorphic pressure, fostering a desire to adopt the technology (Lai et al.,\n2006; Ukobitz & Faullant, 2022).\n\nPost-workshop feedback should be collected from leadership teams to assess understanding and\naddress any concerns, refining future sessions to ensure that leadership remains well-informed and\naligned with Al initiatives.\n\nIn terms of policy formulation, an initial AI ethics and governance policy should be developed,\naddressing ethical considerations and governance structures for AI use. This policy should\nestablish foundational principles for AI adoption within the organization, prioritizing ethical\nconsiderations from the outset."}, {"title": "3.2 Adoption of General-Purpose Generative AI Tools", "content": "The current interest in AI has been fueled by the release of generative AI tools. Examples include\nOpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini (erstwhile Bard), and Microsoft's Copilot (Szczesniewski\net al., 2024). These are general purpose tools which can be used for a variety of tasks in a number\nof domains (Aguinis et al., 2024; Biswas, 2023; Firat, 2023; George & George, 2023; Rane, 2023).\n\nThese general-purpose tools mostly have both the free and paid versions and thus serve as a good\nstarting point for a company looking to adopt Al as employees can be encouraged to start using\nthese tools without any cost commitment. Employees should be given access to these general-\npurpose tools asked to integrate them into daily operations. This allows them to interact with and\nutilize Al technology practically. To facilitate this introduction, training sessions and hands-on\nworkshops should be organized to ensure employees are comfortable using these new tools.\nTraining increases individuals' knowledge which in turn creates a positive attitude towards a new\ntechnology (Mullins & Cronan, 2021). These sessions should cover the functionalities and benefits\nof the Al tools, providing practical demonstrations and opportunities for practice. Particularly,\ntraining for prompt engineering (Ekin, 2023) should be provided. Increased use and\nexperimentation with a technology fosters a positive attitude in individuals (Tubaishat et al., 2016).\n\nRegular user feedback should be collected to identify areas for improvement for smooth integration\nof these tools into workflows. Additionally, usage analysis reviews should be conducted regularly\nto measure the impact and effectiveness of the AI tools, identifying any issues or areas for\nenhancement.\n\nIn terms of policy formulation, data privacy and usage policies should be developed, outlining how\ndata will be used, stored, and protected when interacting with AI tools. This includes ensuring\ncompliance with legal standards and maintaining user privacy and data security."}, {"title": "3.3 Adoption of Off-the-Shelf Task-Specific Tools", "content": "Once the employees have become familiar with general purpose tools and have experienced the\npower of generative AI, the next step is to use task specific tools. Many established companies and\nstartups are developing task specific tools on top of generative AI models which excel at doing a\nspecific task (Future Tools - Find The Exact AI Tool For Your Needs, n.d.; There's An AI For That\n(TAAFT) - The #1 AI Aggregator, n.d.). These tools allow enhancing efficiency and productivity\nin specific areas. To decide which tools to use, a comprehensive assessment should be conducted\nto identify key tasks and processes that can benefit from AI optimization. This involves analyzing\ncurrent workflows and pinpointing areas where AI can add significant value. Based on the\nassessment, suitable off-the-shelf AI solutions should be selected and implemented. These\nsolutions must be chosen for their ability to address specific organizational needs (Alami et al.,"}, {"title": "3.4 In-House Development of Generative AI Tools", "content": "In stage 2 and 3, the focus is on using readily available tools; however, once organizations have\ngained experience with off-the-shelf products and become more familiar with AI and its potential,\nthey may start to see new opportunities or better ways to use AI that these standard solutions cannot\nsupport. This growing familiarity and understanding of Al capabilities\ncan highlight the\nlimitations of off-the-shelf products, prompting organizations to consider developing in-house\ngenerative Al tools.\n\nGenerative Al models can be easily leveraged for building new applications (Weber, 2024),\nparticularly with the availability of frameworks created specifically for this purpose (Pinheiro et\nal., 2023; Topsakal & Akinci, 2023). By doing so, organizations can achieve greater customization,\ncontrol, and integration with their specific business needs. In-house development also enhances\ndata privacy and security, offers potential long-term cost efficiencies, and provides the flexibility\nto innovate and adapt quickly to evolving market conditions or internal requirements. Therefore,"}, {"title": "Phase 5: In-House Development of Discriminative AI Models", "content": "This phase focuses on the development of discriminative models, which are essential for tasks\nrequiring high precision and specificity. Discriminative models, unlike generative models, are\ndesigned to differentiate between classes and make accurate predictions based on input data. These\nmodels are crucial for applications such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and predictive\nmaintenance, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.\n\nUnlike previous phases, where organizations could leverage existing tools and build on top of\ngenerative Al models, this phase involves developing discriminative models from scratch. This\nprocess requires a significant investment in infrastructure, data collection, model training, and the\nestablishment of dedicated teams and policies. The complexity and specificity of these models\ndemand a more comprehensive approach to ensure they meet the precise needs of the organization.\n\nThe first step in this process involves building the necessary infrastructure to support the\ndevelopment and deployment of discriminative models. Organizations need to decide between\ncloud-based solutions and on-premises data centers. Cloud solutions such as AWS, Google Cloud,\nand Azure offer scalability and flexibility, making them suitable for organizations looking to\nquickly scale their operations. However, on-premises solutions might be preferable for\norganizations dealing with highly sensitive data or seeking long-term cost efficiency. Investing in\nhigh-performance computing resources, such as GPUs and TPUs, is essential to handle the\ncomputational demands of training complex models. Additionally, robust data storage solutions,\nincluding data lakes and data warehouses, should be implemented to efficiently manage and\nretrieve large volumes of data.\n\nEffective data collection and management are critical for training discriminative models.\nOrganizations need to identify and integrate diverse data sources relevant to their specific use\ncases, such as transactional data, customer interactions, and sensor data. Establishing a data\ngovernance framework ensures data quality, consistency, and security across the organization.\nThis includes setting up protocols for data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation to prepare\ndatasets for training models. Adopting advanced data management tools and techniques, such as\nautomated data pipelines and real-time data processing, can enhance efficiency and accuracy in\ndata handling.\n\nTraining and optimizing discriminative models require meticulous planning and execution. This\ninvolves selecting appropriate algorithms and architectures tailored to specific tasks.\nImplementing an iterative process of model development, testing, and validation ensures that\nmodels achieve high performance and generalization capabilities. Utilizing hyperparameter tuning\nand techniques like cross-validation can further refine model accuracy. Maintaining a\ncomprehensive record of experiments and results aids in tracking progress and making informed\nadjustments.\n\nHaving a skilled team is paramount to the success of discriminative model development.\nRecruiting data scientists, machine learning engineers, and domain experts with the necessary\nexpertise in Al and machine learning is crucial. Continuous training and professional development\nopportunities should be provided to keep the team updated with the latest advancements in the\nfield. Establishing a collaborative environment where team members can share knowledge and\ninsights fosters innovation and problem-solving.\n\nPolicy formulation at this stage plays a critical role in ensuring ethical, secure, and effective use\nof discriminative models. Developing comprehensive guidelines that cover aspects such as data\nprivacy, ethical AI use, and compliance with legal standards is essential. These policies should\nalso address coding standards, testing protocols, and deployment procedures to ensure the\nreliability and security of AI systems. Regular reviews and updates of policies are necessary to\nadapt to evolving technological and regulatory landscapes. Collecting user feedback continuously\nand incorporating it into policy adjustments ensures alignment with organizational goals and user\nneeds.\n\nDeveloping discriminative models from scratch involves significant costs, including investments\nin infrastructure, data collection, staff recruitment, and ongoing training. However, the long-term\nbenefits of having highly accurate and customized AI solutions can outweigh these initial\nexpenses. Organizations should conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to ensure that the\ninvestments align with their strategic objectives and provide a clear return on investment."}, {"title": "4.

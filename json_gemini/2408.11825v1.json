INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized as a crucial element for the advancement and competitiveness of modern organizations (Kordon, 2020; Prasad Agrawal, 2023). Despite its potential, the adoption of AI technologies faces significant barriers that hinder its implementation, particularly in Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs). These barriers include cost, lack of technical skills, and employee acceptance (Auer et al., 2023; Oldemeyer et al., 2024; Ulrich & Frank, 2021).\nExisting studies on adoption of AI in organizations have mainly relied on established models like Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) (Polisetty et al., 2024), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Rahman et al., 2023) or People-Process-Technology Model (Uren & Edwards, 2023). While these models provide valuable explanatory insights into the factors influencing AI adoption, they fall short in offering practical, actionable guidelines that managers can directly apply in their organizational contexts. These models are primarily theoretical and do not sufficiently address the specific challenges faced by SMEs, which often have limited resources and unique operational constraints.\nGiven these limitations, there is a pressing need for a prescriptive model that not only takes into account the barriers to AI adoption but also provides clear, actionable guidelines for overcoming these obstacles. Such a model would be particularly beneficial for SMEs, which stand to gain significantly from AI but are often hindered by the aforementioned barriers.\nAccordingly, we propose a prescriptive framework for AI adoption in SMEs. This framework is designed to be practical and actionable, providing managers with clear steps and strategies for implementing AI in their organizations. In developing this framework, we have set the following goals:\n1. The framework should be straightforward and easy to comprehend, ensuring that managers can easily follow it.\n2. The framework should specifically address the common barriers to AI adoption in SMEs, such as cost, lack of technical skills, and employee resistance, providing strategies for overcoming these challenges.\n3. Unlike existing explanatory models, the framework should offer concrete, actionable guidelines that managers can follow to successfully adopt AI technologies.\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows. In section 2, we describe methodology, followed by the description of the proposed framework in section 3. Discussion on how the proposed"}, {"title": "2. METHODOLOGY", "content": "We have employed a reflection and synthesis approach to develop a prescriptive framework for AI adoption in SMEs. This methodology involves integrating existing fragments of insights from various sources, including theoretical models, empirical studies, and practical experiences (Jaakkola, 2020). By reflecting on these diverse perspectives, we aim to construct a cohesive and practical guide tailored to the unique needs and constraints of SMEs. We draw on a wide array of existing knowledge and experiences to inform our framework. This approach allows us to capture the multifaceted nature of AI adoption, considering both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical challenges faced by SMEs. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to provide actionable strategies that address the specific barriers SMEs encounter, such as cost, lack of technical skills, and employee acceptance, thus facilitating effective AI implementation"}, {"title": "3. THE FRAMEWORK", "content": "This section outlines the structured, phased framework designed to facilitate the adoption of AI in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The proposed framework comprises the following phases:\n1. Awareness for Leadership\n2. Adoption of General-Purpose Generative AI Tools\n3. Adoption of Off-the-Shelf Task-Specific Tools\n4. In-House Development of Generative AI Tools\n5. In-House Development of Discriminative AI Models\nEach phase includes specific activities, policy initiatives, review processes, and associated costs, providing a comprehensive guide for SMEs to navigate the complexities of AI adoption effectively which is summarized in Table 1. Each of these phases is discussed next."}, {"title": "3.1 Awareness for Leadership", "content": "Management support is often a key enabler of successful adoption of an initiative in a company (Hsu et al., 2018; Kurup & Gupta, 2022). Therefore, the first step should be to educate and engage leadership on the potential and impact of artificial intelligence (AI). Cultivating a comprehensive understanding among leadership can ensure strategic alignment and secure commitment to AI initiatives.\nTo achieve this objective, workshops and seminars for leadership teams should be organized. These can play a crucial role, as awareness of technology significantly drives its adoption (Subedi et al., 2009). Such sessions should provide an extensive overview of AI technologies, covering the basics, current trends, and future possibilities. The aim should be to demystify AI for executives to help them understand what it has to offer.\nSharing success stories and case studies from similar industries can help demonstrate the practical applications and benefits of AI. These real-world examples enable leaders to visualize how AI can be effectively applied within their own organization. Moreover, case studies and success stories can create memetic isomorphic pressure, fostering a desire to adopt the technology (Lai et al., 2006; Ukobitz & Faullant, 2022).\nPost-workshop feedback should be collected from leadership teams to assess understanding and address any concerns, refining future sessions to ensure that leadership remains well-informed and aligned with Al initiatives.\nIn terms of policy formulation, an initial AI ethics and governance policy should be developed, addressing ethical considerations and governance structures for AI use. This policy should establish foundational principles for AI adoption within the organization, prioritizing ethical considerations from the outset."}, {"title": "3.2 Adoption of General-Purpose Generative AI Tools", "content": "The current interest in AI has been fueled by the release of generative AI tools. Examples include OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini (erstwhile Bard), and Microsoft's Copilot (Szczesniewski et al., 2024). These are general purpose tools which can be used for a variety of tasks in a number of domains (Aguinis et al., 2024; Biswas, 2023; Firat, 2023; George & George, 2023; Rane, 2023)."}, {"title": "3.3 Adoption of Off-the-Shelf Task-Specific Tools", "content": "Once the employees have become familiar with general purpose tools and have experienced the power of generative AI, the next step is to use task specific tools.

These tools allow enhancing efficiency and productivity in specific areas. To decide which tools to use, a comprehensive assessment should be conducted to identify key tasks and processes that can benefit from AI optimization. This involves analyzing current workflows and pinpointing areas where AI can add significant value. Based on the assessment, suitable off-the-shelf AI solutions should be selected and implemented. These solutions must be chosen for their ability to address specific organizational needs (Alami et al.,"}, {"title": "3.4 In-House Development of Generative AI Tools", "content": "In stage 2 and 3, the focus is on using readily available tools; however, once organizations have gained experience with off-the-shelf products and become more familiar with AI and its potential, they may start to see new opportunities or better ways to use AI that these standard solutions cannot support. This growing familiarity and understanding of Al capabilities\ncan highlight the limitations of off-the-shelf products, prompting organizations to consider developing in-house generative Al tools.\nGenerative Al models can be easily leveraged for building new applications (Weber, 2024), particularly with the availability of frameworks created specifically for this purpose (Pinheiro et al., 2023; Topsakal & Akinci, 2023). By doing so, organizations can achieve greater customization, control, and integration with their specific business needs. In-house development also enhances data privacy and security, offers potential long-term cost efficiencies, and provides the flexibility to innovate and adapt quickly to evolving market conditions or internal requirements. Therefore,"}, {"title": "Phase 5: In-House Development of Discriminative AI Models", "content": "This phase focuses on the development of discriminative models, which are essential for tasks requiring high precision and specificity. Discriminative models, unlike generative models, are designed to differentiate between classes and make accurate predictions based on input data. These models are crucial for applications such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and predictive maintenance, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.\nUnlike previous phases, where organizations could leverage existing tools and build on top of generative Al models, this phase involves developing discriminative models from scratch. This process requires a significant investment in infrastructure, data collection, model training, and the establishment of dedicated teams and policies. The complexity and specificity of these models demand a more comprehensive approach to ensure they meet the precise needs of the organization.\nThe first step in this process involves building the necessary infrastructure to support the development and deployment of discriminative models. Organizations need to decide between cloud-based solutions and on-premises data centers. Cloud solutions such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer scalability and flexibility, making them suitable for organizations looking to quickly scale their operations. However, on-premises solutions might be preferable for organizations dealing with highly sensitive data or seeking long-term cost efficiency. Investing in high-performance computing resources, such as GPUs and TPUs, is essential to handle the computational demands of training complex models. Additionally, robust data storage solutions, including data lakes and data warehouses, should be implemented to efficiently manage and retrieve large volumes of data.\nEffective data collection and management are critical for training discriminative models. Organizations need to identify and integrate diverse data sources relevant to their specific use cases, such as transactional data, customer interactions, and sensor data. Establishing a data governance framework ensures data quality, consistency, and security across the organization. This includes setting up protocols for data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation to prepare datasets for training models. Adopting advanced data management tools and techniques, such as automated data pipelines and real-time data processing, can enhance efficiency and accuracy in data handling.\nTraining and optimizing discriminative models require meticulous planning and execution. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms and architectures tailored to specific tasks.\nImplementing an iterative process of model development, testing, and validation ensures that"}, {"title": "4.

Our approach extends the capabilities of the original Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MDWA) by incorporating multiple objectives, enabling a more comprehensive optimization process. We applied MOMDWA to three quantum control scenarios, focusing on optimizing the balance between control fidelity, energy consumption, and control smoothness. The results demonstrate that MOMDWA significantly enhances quantum control efficiency and robustness, achieving high fidelity while minimizing energy use and ensuring smooth control pulses.

Focusing on a single objective may overlook other critical factors, limiting the overall solution's effectiveness. While single-objective optimization can yield good results in specific areas, it fails to capture the complexity of the problem as a whole. In contrast, multi-objective optimization offers a more comprehensive approach by balancing and integrating various objectives, leading to more effective problem-solving and improved decision-making.\nIn multi-objective optimization, conflicting objectives make it challenging to satisfy all goals with a single solution [2]. This requires finding a set of solutions, known as the Pareto optimal set, where no objective can be improved without worsening another. These solutions form the Pareto front, representing the best trade-offs among the objectives. The main advantage of the Pareto optimal set is that it offers a range of optimal solutions, providing decision-makers with flexibility in addressing trade-offs. This approach maximizes the optimization of various goals, enabling a more comprehensive resolution of complex problems.\nMulti-objective optimization problems are highly complex, requiring effective solution methods. Metaheuristic approaches, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence algorithms, and cooperative metaheuristics, have become essential for approximating the Pareto optimal set within a reasonable time [3]. Among these, multi-objective swarm intelligence algorithms stand out for their efficiency and widespread application in solving complex problems. They deliver robust solutions, making them a crucial tool for multi-objective optimization in practical scenarios [4].\nSeveral key swarm intelligence algorithms have proven highly effective in multi-objective optimization. Notably, NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) uses a Non-dominated Sorting mechanism to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence, efficiently balancing multiple objectives. Following NSGA-II, MOPSO (Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization) extends Particle Swarm Optimization with Pareto dominance [5]. Other algorithms include MOGWO (Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer) [6], MOHS (Multi-Objective Harmony Search) [7], MOMVO (Multi-Objective Multi-Verse Optimizer) [8], MOABC (Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony) [9], MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm) [10], and MSSA (Multi-Objective Salp Swarm Algorithm) [11]. Each of these algorithms leverages unique strategies to effectively address complex multi-objective problems, showcasing the flexibility and power of swarm intelligence [12].\nQuantum information science, a critical frontier in modern technology, combines quantum mechanics with information theory to revolutionize information processing [13, 14]. By leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement, it surpasses classical computing limitations, enabling polynomial-time solutions for complex tasks and marking a paradigm shift in computational complexity. Many challenges in this field are quantum control problems, where precise manipulation of quantum systems is essential for achieving specific states or operations. Effective quantum control enhances the reliability and efficiency of quantum computing, making it a cornerstone of quantum information processing."}, {"title": "Multi-Objective Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MOMDWA)", "content": "MOMDWA employs a mutation technique and boundary handling method tailored to different situations.

Effective quantum control enhances the reliability and efficiency of quantum computation, making it crucial for quantum information processing. Multi-objective optimization algorithms can solve quantum control problems by adjusting control fields to transition a quantum system from an initial state to a target state, optimizing control functions related to field strength and timing to reach the best possible state within a given timeframe.\nKey optimization objectives include fidelity, control field strength (energy consumption), and control field smoothness. In scientific research and engineering, various quantum control models target systems like atoms in multi-level structures or qubits in superconducting circuits [17]. Despite differing physical characteristics, a quantum system's state is generally described by a quantum state |y(t)), a complex vector defined by the system's specific physical properties.

The primary optimization objective is the performance function J(u), usually defined as fidelity, which is based on the final state \u03a8(T) of the quantum system and the target state \u03a8target . We aim to maximize this fidelity, typically calculated as the square of the modulus of the inner product of these two states for pure quantum states as is shown in equation (27).\n\nFor mixed quantum states, it is the trace distance between the two states. First, we calculate the density matrices \u03c1(T) and \u03c1target of the two states as is shown in equation (28).\n\nthen calculate the trace distance between the two density matrices as is shown in equation (29).\n\nIn the three quantum control problems mentioned, the first two involve pure states, while the third involves a mixed state. Fidelity, defined by the alignment of vectors in complex space, is maximized when the final state and target state are aligned or opposite. However, this can lead to optimization challenges, as optimal solutions may cluster in two distant areas of the search space, complicating convergence.

To select the 'optimal solution,' we apply the TOPSIS algorithm to evaluate the solutions on the Pareto front.\nWe start by screening the solutions based on fidelity, as other metrics like energy consumption and control smoothness are irrelevant if fidelity is too low. Solutions above the fidelity threshold proceed to TOPSIS.

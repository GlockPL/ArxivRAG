Successful analyses are often interdisciplinary, leveraging mathematical tools to extract structure from stories and insights from structure. Historically, these tools have been restricted to one dimensional charts and dynamic social networks; however, modern AI offers the possibility of identifying more fully the plot structure, character incentives, and, importantly, counterfactual plot lines that the story could have taken but did not take. In this work, we use AI to model the structure of stories as game-theoretic objects, amenable to quantitative analysis. This allows us to not only interrogate each character's decision making, but also possibly peer into the original author's conception of the characters' world. We demonstrate our proposed technique on Shakespeare's famous Romeo and Juliet. We conclude with a discussion of how our analysis could be replicated in broader contexts, including real-life scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Stories have long been one of humanity's most cherished methods for transmitting knowledge, taking shape in epic poems, religious texts, folktales, literature, and the oral traditions of cultures, families, and organizations. While stories are remarkably effective as a communication tool between humans, they were, until very recently, challenging for machine learning models to process due to their lack of a clear structure that facilitates mathematical reasoning.\nThere have been various attempts to extract from stories a mathematical structure, and then use that to reason quantitatively about the story. Kurt Vonnegut [1999] proposed in his avant-garde (and originally rejected) master's thesis the notion of the shapes of a story. In his famous lecture, he says:\n\u201cI have tried to bring scientific thinking to literary criticism... Stories have very simple shapes, ones that computers can understand.\"\nVonnegut's attempt consisted in constructing one dimensional functions that represented the rise and fall of characters' fortunes across a plot line and then classifying stories according to the shapes of such functions. More sophisticated methods have later tried to represent the relationships between the characters as a dynamic graph (see the survey by Labatut and Bost [2019]) and used tools from network analysis to dissect stories according to the graphs they induce. Reagan et al. [2016] constructs shapes by analyzing how the overall sentiment varies across different windows of text within the"}, {"title": "Game Trees and Nash Equilibrium", "content": "We will formulate a story as a game in extensive form. We refer to the classical textbook of Fudenberg and Tirole [1991] for a detailed exposition. A game consists of a set of n players (here corresponding to the characters in the story) and is represented as a tree. The root of the tree corresponds to the beginning of the story and each path corresponds to one possible way the story can unfold. The leaf-nodes of the tree correspond to outcomes of the story and we will associate with each outcome a vector of payoffs which can be viewed as how happy each character is with this outcome. The internal nodes of the tree can be of two types: (i) a decision node which corresponds to a decision by one of the players; or (ii) chance node: which is a random decision by nature (capturing e.g., whether a secret message sent by one character will reach another character).\nIn games, it is quite common that not all parties share the same information. For example, in poker, a player does not observe what cards have been dealt to the other players unless that information is revealed in the course of the game. Because of this, as the play unravels from the root of the tree towards a leaf, it is possible that a player cannot distinguish (based on the information they have observed thus far) the true state of the game from several possible nodes based on the information they have observed so far. A set of nodes that would be indistinguishable to a player given the information that they have observed when any one of these nodes would be reached in the course of a play is called an \"information set\" of that player. Each player induces a partition of the nodes of the tree into information sets. Obviously if an information set of some player contains a decision node for that player, then all other nodes in that same information set are also decision nodes for that player and the same actions are available at all decision nodes in the information set.\nA pure strategy of a player in an extensive-form game is a mapping from all information sets containing decision nodes for that player to an action they would take if the play were to reach any one node in that information set (as the player cannot distinguish among these nodes). A mixed strategy of a player is a distribution over pure strategies. A behavioral strategy of a player is a mapping from each information set containing decision nodes for that player to a distribution over the actions that are available to the player at that information set. Once all players choose a strategy, a distribution over leaf nodes is induced, conditioning on the play reaching any particular node of the tree. We can thus compute expected payoffs for all players at each node. We say that a set of strategies are in Nash equilibrium if, given the strategies of the other players, no player can change their own strategy to improve their expected payoff at the root of the tree. In this work, we compute a specific type of Nash equilibrium called a limiting logit equilibrium (LLE) that is unique in almost all games [McKelvey and Palfrey, 1998, Turocy, 2005]."}, {"title": "Traversing the Game Tree and Exploring Counterfactuals with an LLM", "content": "The first step in our proof of concept is to apply an LLM (in this case Gemini) to identify in a story who are the main characters, what are their decisions, and from there, uncover the plot structure. As a first step we ask Gemini to identify the main characters and their decisions (https://g.co/gemini/share/1f5eaa4a378e) which produces the \"game path\" realized in the play. Next we use the language model to explore how the story could have unfolded if the characters had"}, {"title": "Creating the Game Object for a Game Theory Engine", "content": "Using the information collected with the help of Gemini in the previous section, we can now translate the story into an extensive-form game, which we illustrate in Figure 1.

The Nash equilibrium suggests that with 50% probability, Juliet elects to fake her death leading to Romeo tragically ending his life. But with equal probability, Juliet elects to marry Paris despite her love for Romeo. According to this game-theoretic model, the audience observes just one possible sequence of events in the story of Romeo and Juliet.\nAssuming Game I, Romeo was, in fact, irrational in taking his own life. However, assuming Game II, Romeo was unlucky! Juliet's rational decision was to flip a coin to marry Paris or fake her death,"}, {"title": "Discussion and Future Impact", "content": "In this proof of concept, we used an LLM to analyze a play, distill its main elements into a game tree and produced two possible game trees (Game I and Game II) to represent the play. Only in Game II are the decisions made by the characters in the actual play in the support of the equilibrium. For that reason, we say that Game II \"rationalizes\" the story while Game I doesn't. Once we obtain a game tree that rationalizes the story, its equilibrium induces a value function on the nodes (Figure 2). This allows us to plot how the expected fortune of the characters vary along the game path in the play. Such value function can be thought of as the expectation of a reader (who has the game tree in mind) who is still uncertain at that stage about which path will be taken. In the case of Romeo and Juliet, the value function follows the prototypical path of a tragedy: the fortunes of the characters initially rise, suggesting the possibility of a happy outcome, but ultimately fall precipitously.\nOur goal is to develop this proof of concept into a systematic approach that can be readily extended to analyze other stories. This will allow us to obtain game representations for different narratives as well as multiple interpretations of the same story. Analyzing various game theoretic interpretations of a story can reveal different ways to rationalize it.\nTo facilitate this extension, we can utilize few-shot prompting [Brown et al., 2020] with our Romeo and Juliet game tree example (Section 3, Figure 1) and chain of thought prompting [Wei et al., 2022] to guide the model's reasoning about game structure and payoffs. This approach, with light human supervision, has allowed us to generate multiple representations of Romeo and Juliet (https://g.co/gemini/share/6eb67cbcba84, https://g.co/gemini/share/4de95dd0bbf0) and extend to new stories like Hamlet (https://g.co/gemini/share/f74271e49b31).\nSeveral important questions emerge from this work for future investigation. While we defined a game to \"rationalize\" a story when its equilibrium assigns positive probability to the actual story path, evaluating game-theoretic representations requires a more comprehensive framework. Such a framework should consider the structural fidelity to key decision points, the ability to capture strategic interactions between characters, and the validity of assigned payoffs and chance probabilities.\nMore fundamentally, we acknowledge that game-theoretic representations have inherent limitations in capturing narrative complexity. Elements like character development, emotions, and themes may not readily fit within game trees' formal structure. These boundaries suggest promising directions for developing approaches that complement game-theoretic analysis with other computational methods, potentially offering new insights at the intersection of formal modeling and literary analysis."}]}

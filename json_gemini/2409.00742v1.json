To explore this hypothesis, we introduce an agent-based model of financial markets, where trading agents are embedded in a hierarchical network of communities, and communities influence the strategies and opinions of traders. Empirical analysis of the model shows that its behaviour conforms to several stylized facts observed in real financial markets; and the model is able to realistically simulate the effects that social media-driven phenomena, such as echo chambers and pump-and-dump schemes, have on financial markets.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In recent years, there has been a dramatic shift in the accessibility of financial markets. New fintech applications such as Robinhood and eToro have enabled retail investors to trade directly on traditional markets, without the need for expensive brokerage services; and the unprecedented disruption of new cryptocurrency assets, with their overall valuation rising from zero to more than one trillion dollars in less than 15 years, has driven crypto-speculation by millions of novice investors. At the same time, social media has become a ubiquitous presence in the lives of billions of people across the globe, which has influenced behaviours for both good and bad.\nThis shift in financial market participants and networks of influence has resulted in new causal drivers of market dynamics, leading to previously rare events becoming relatively commonplace (e.g., GameStop short squeeze, Klein (2022)). Additionally, the democratisation of markets has dramatically increased the opportunities for malicious actors to take advantage of the na\u00efve through illicit practices such as pump-and-dump schemes (Li et al., 2021).\nContribution: In this paper, we introduce a new agent-based model of financial markets to capture this shift in dynamics. In particular, we extend the well-established model of Lux-Marchesi (Lux and Marchesi, 1999) by embedding agents on a hierarchical network to form communities of influence. These communities represent social media influence on behaviours. We are able to show that the model generates realistic behaviours under a variety of scenarios, and we are able to investigate the effects of social media influence, the effects of echo chambers, and markets most likely to be susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes.

Social media and financial markets", "content": "Wang et al. (2022) established a causal link between social media sentiment and same-day stock returns by analysing online messages from stock investment forum EastMoney Guba. This finding is supported by M\u00fcller et al. (2023), who discovered the sentiment expressed in X (formerly Twitter) messages has a similar effect, and the influence on returns is stronger for \u201crisky, volatile\u201d assets with a market price that tends to deviate from the underlying fundamental value.\nSentiment expressed through social media has also been shown to significantly impact market volatility, such that positive news on social platforms can lead to rapid price increases, while negative news can cause sudden declines. For instance, Gilbert and Karahalios (2010) demonstrated a direct link between the sentiment on social media platforms and subsequent movements in the stock market, suggesting that increases in subjective expressions of anxiety could predict an increase in volatility for the S&P 500 index. Additionally, Jiao et al. (2020) found that, whilst influence from traditional news media predicts a decrease in an asset's volatility, influence from social media has the opposite effect. They present evidence suggesting that this distinction can most accurately be explained by an \"echo chamber\u201d model, where traders in social media are disproportionately affected by information that gets repeated (i.e., echoes) within the network.\nThe Echo Chamber Effect refers to the idea that social media platforms can create environments where investors are exposed predominantly to opinions and information that reinforce their existing beliefs (Cinelli et al., 2021). Such environments can lead to overconfidence and exacerbate market anomalies, as investors might ignore contrary evidence or broader market signals. Barber and Odean (2008) found that individual investors tend to trade more aggressively under the influence of overconfidence, which could be heightened by echo chambers in social media settings, leading to suboptimal trading decisions.\nCookson et al. (2022) provide evidence for the existence of the Echo Chamber Effect by analysing the data of more than 400,000 users on social network StockTwits. They reveal that users of this forum have a strong tendency to selectively expose themselves to information that reinforces their pre-existing beliefs, which leads to persistent disagreement within the forum and may help explain why assets subject to social media chatter display more price volatility. Furthermore, studies such as Jiao et al. (2020) and Cookson et al. (2022) suggest that the Echo Chamber Effect is more prevalent for positive opinions than for negative opinions; which leads to social media communities displaying disproportionately bullish tendencies (i.e., expectations that future prices will increase) regarding their most frequently discussed assets or asset classes.\nSocial media is also associated with the illicit practice of pump-and-dump, which is described by Li et al. (2021) as the act of artificially inflating (i.e., \u201cpump\u201d) the price of an asset through exaggerated or entirely fabricated statements. Then, once the asset has been bought by unsuspecting buyers (drawn in by the hype), the schemers sell (i.e., \"dump\") their holdings at the elevated price, causing excess supply which precipitates a sudden collapse in market price and significant losses for the unwitting investors left holding the (essentially worthless) asset. Lund (2022) suggests that pump-and-dump schemes are often facilitated by the reach and anonymity of social media, where it is easy to spread misleading information quickly to large and geographically dislocated audiences.\""}, {"title": "2.2.

Two types of trading agent strategy populate the model: fundamentalists and chartists. Fundamentalists make trading decisions based on the difference between the current market price and the current fundamental value, such that the asset is bought if market price is below the fundamental (i.e., when the asset is under-priced) and sold if the market price is above the fundamental (i.e., when the asset is over-priced). In this way, fundamentalists tend to drive the market price toward the fundamental value. In comparison, chartists make speculative trading decisions based on sentiment. Chartists fall into two categories: optimists, who are bullish and will always buy on the assumption that the market price will rise; and pessimists, who are bearish and will always sell on the assumption that the market price will fall. In this way, chartists tend to drive the market away from the fundamental value.\nImportantly, agents in LM99 are adaptive and can switch between chartist and fundamentalist trading strategies based on the success, or profitability, of their current approach.

These communities represent traders interacting via online forums or social media groups, and the opinions (i.e., optimism/pessimism) and behaviours (i.e., chartist/fundamentalist) of community members affect the opinions and behaviours of others.

Research gap: social media-driven financial ABM", "content": "We have seen that social media networks have a significant effect on the behaviour of financial markets (Section 2.1), and hierarchical network models can successfully model aspects of social media dynamics (Section 2.3). Combined, the two aforementioned ideas highlight the potential of applying hierarchical structures to models of social media communication between participants trading in a financial market. While some models, such as MV23, explore hierarchical structures as a way to model communication dynamics within financial markets (Section 2.4), we identified no models in the literature that are explicitly tailored to the context of social media. Therefore, we present hierarchical agent-based models of social-media influence on financial markets as a research gap in the literature.\nIn this paper, we address this research gap by introducing and exploring a hierarchical extension of LM99 (Section 2.2). We initially considered generalizing MV23 to explore social media effects under different scenarios. However, we found that the implementation details of MV23 are difficult to interpret and the model's parameter configurations are not presented in Meine and Vvedensky (2023) (for detailed analysis, see Bohorquez, 2024).

The model contains a single asset and agents can perform one of two actions: buy the asset; or sell the asset. Excess profit is used to measure the opportunity cost inherent to these two actions; i.e., if an agent bought the asset, its excess profit is how much it made from the purchase minus how much it would have made from not buying the asset, and vice-versa for the excess profit if it decided to sell. We calculate the excess profits for fundamentalists, $EP_f$, excess profits"}, {"title": "3.2. Model extension: hierarchical network", "content": "We extend LM99 by embedding agents within a hierarchical network structure, which allows us to model a trading agent's opinions and behaviours being influenced by other members of their local community and wider community-of-communities. The network contains two types of node: community and trading agent. Trading agents exist within the bottom level (leaf nodes) of the hierarchy, while all higher-level nodes are designated as communities.\nWe assume that the network hierarchy has L levels and every non-leaf node has exactly k children. Then the total number of trading agents, $N_t$, is equal to the number of leaf nodes, and the total number of communities, $N_c$, is equal to the number of non-leaf nodes, i.e.:\n$N_t = k^{L-1}$,\n$N_c = \\frac{k^{L-1} - 1}{k - 1}N_t$\nUnlike the base model of LM99, where agents have perfect knowledge of the distribution of opinions across the whole market, in our extended model, chartists only have access to information that is transmitted through the network structure. As such, the optimist \u2192 pessimist transition equation (3) is replaced by equation (10):\n$U_1 = b(\\frac{C_o - C_p}{C_o + C_p}) + \\frac{X_2}{\\tilde{p}}$,\nwhere b represents hierarchy Strength, and $C_o, C_p$ represent the proportion of optimists and pessimists in the local community, respectively.\nCommunity nodes do not store a discrete state but rather a vector: [o, p, f], where o, p, and \u0192 are positive, continuous variables representing the optimist, pessimist, and fundamentalist states respectively.\nAdditionally, by letting traders behave like a homogeneous community (i.e., a community only populated by one child type), equation (11) simplifies modelling the interaction between communities and traders:\nOptimist = [\\omega, 0, 0]\nPessimist = [0, \\upsilon, 0]\nFundamentalist = [0, 0, 1]\nwhere w and v represent the influence of optimist and pessimist children, respectively.\nCommunity nodes update their state in two distinct phases:\n1. Backward pass: for each child, u, a community's state is updated according to equation (12). In other words, each community state, C, is determined by the average of its k children's states:\n$C[o, p, f]_u = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_i u_i[o, p, f]$\n2. Forward pass: following equation (13), each community state, C, is updated to account for the state of their respective parent community, Q:\n$C[o, p, f] = \\frac{1}{2}(C[o, p, f] + \\phi \\cdot Q[o, p, f])$\nwhere $ \\phi $ represents the network efficiency of information diffusion. As $ \\phi \\rightarrow \\infty $, each trader is equally affected by the averaged opinions of all other traders in the network, while lower values of $ \\phi $ imply that traders are more strongly affected by opinions in the local community, and $ \\phi  = 0$ represents insular traders that are not affected by the opinions of any other trader, regardless of network distance.\nAt each time-step, the backward pass is followed by the forward pass, which is then followed by traders switching their state according to the model's transition pressures. Finally, following the LM99 paradigm defined in equation (4), the market price is updated through the interaction of trading agents buying and selling.\nThe full set of model parameters and their descriptions are listed in Table 1. For the base LM99 parameters, we follow the three standard parameter sets presented in Lux and Marchesi (2000, p.692). Note that number of traders, N, is replaced by $N_t$ from equation (9) and influence of chartists, \u03b1\u2081, is replaced by b as described in equation (10).\nNetwork parameters are presented at the bottom of Table 1. We fix hierarchy levels L = 5 and children per community k = 5, giving $N_t$= 625 trading agents in total as per equation (9). To preserve model symmetry, the influence of optimists w = 1 and pessimists v = 1 are fixed. Efficiency of information diffusion $ \\phi $= 0.5 is fixed to balance the relative strength of influence of child and parent communities in equation (13). Finally, b controls the strength of hierarchy influence on the optimist \u2192 pessimist transition, as defined in equation (10).\nNote that, while there is no toggle to quickly reduce the hierarchical model into the base LM99 model, some specific parameter arrangements will achieve this purpose, e.g., setting b = 0 in equation (10) is equivalent to LM99 with \u03b1\u2081 = 0, and as $ \\phi \\rightarrow \\infty $ in equation (13) the model approaches LM99 with \u03b1\u2081 = b."}, {"title": "3.3.

In this work, we consider four stylized facts of financial markets, and we describe a metric for detecting financial bubbles."}, {"title": "3.3.1. Fat tails of returns", "content": "The fat tails phenomenon is a stylized fact observed for an asset's (logarithmic) returns, indicating that large deviations from the mean are more common than would be expected under a normal distribution. Fat tails are usually represented through leptokurtic distributions; however, as explained in Lux and Marchesi (2000), kurtosis is a somewhat ambiguous concept, and it is not entirely clear how to compare the kurtosis statistics obtained for various time series. For this reason, rather than measuring kurtosis, it is standard practice to measure fat-tailedness by assuming that the tails of the returns decay according to a Pareto distribution: $1 - ax^{-x}$.\nEquation (14) details how to estimate a for a tail of size m out of a total of n observations (Hill, 1975):\n$\\tilde{H}_m = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m [ln(R_{n-i-1}) - ln(R_{n-m})]$\nFollowing standard practice, we will present values for the 2.5%, 5%, and 10% right-tails of the absolute returns.\nFact: The absolute returns of most financial assets present a tail decay such that 2 < x \u2264 6, with lower values of a representing fatter tails (Cont, 2001)."}, {"title": "3.3.2. Volatility clustering", "content": "The volatility of an asset, o, is generally measured as the standard deviation of market price, defined as:\n$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(p_i - \\mu)^2}{N}}$\nwhere \u00b5 is mean market price and $p_i$ is market price at time-step i.\nIn simulation, but not in real markets, we can also calculate the deviation of market price from the fundamental value, $F_\u03c3$, defined as:\n$F_\u03c3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(p_i - f_i)^2}{N} - \\frac{\\sum(p_i - \\mu)^2}{N}}$\nwhere $f_i$ is the fundamental value at time-step i.\nVolatility clustering is the observation that asset returns have a tendency to cluster based on their magnitude/significance. That is, large changes tend to be followed by large changes; while small changes tend to be followed by small changes. To evaluate volatility clustering, we measure the auto-correlation function (ACF) for the absolute and squared returns when \u03c4 = 10 and T = 70. We compute ACF by importing the acf function from statsmodels.api.tsf.\nFact: We expect ACF value to be larger than o, indicating that, for all time-steps, there is a correlation between the current returns and returns from 10 time-steps ago."}, {"title": "3.3.3. Return to gaussianity", "content": "The return to gaussianity or aggregational gaussianity phenomenon refers to the expectation that the distribution of the asset's (logarithmic) returns should resemble a normal distribution for large values of T.

Slow decay of autocorrelation", "content": "This stylized fact is related to the observation that the autocorrelation in the absolute returns of an asset tends to decay slowly, following a power law such that $f(x) = at^{-\u03b2}$. To evaluate the slow decay of the ACF, we measure the decay of absolute returns with T = 70 as a function of \u03c4. This value is calculated by using the curve_fit function of scipy.optimize library to fit an exponential decay function $f(x) = at^{-\u03b2}$ to the ACF of the absolute returns.\nFact: When calculated through GARCH-type models, real markets exhibit \u03b2\u2208 [0.2, 0.4] (Cont, 2001).

Financial bubbles & explosive behaviour", "content": "Explosive behaviour in an asset price describes a rapid and anomalous increase. A related concept is a bubble, which also describes a rapid and anomalous increase in market price. However, to be classified as a bubble, it is necessary for the price increase to be driven by speculation rather than an increase in fundamental value; whereas explosive behaviour covers both scenarios.\nTo detect financial market bubbles, we use the simple and well-documented GSADF test (Phillips et al., 2015). For the GSADF method with finite samples, we derive our significance level and minimum window size, ro, values from Phillips et al. (2011); see Table 2. We also use the PWY procedure to detect explosive periods (Phillips et al., 2015), and follow the methodology of Phillips et al. (2012) to identify significant bubbles through the asymptotic SADF critical values (see Table 2)."}, {"title": "4.

Reproducing stylized facts of financial markets", "content": "Fig. 1 shows sample runs with fixed fundamental value, $p_f$ = 10, under increasing values of b (refer to equation (10)). We see that price movements increase in magnitude as the hierarchy's effect becomes more pronounced, with the market price displaying sustained and significant deviation from the fundamental price when b is large.\nAs shown Table 3, more rigorous analysis reveals that: for all parameter sets, an increase in b is associated with a significant increase in price volatility and a significant increase in the likelihood of explosive periods.\nFurthermore, by looking at individual runs (e.g., see Fig. 2), we can see that instances of explosive behaviour are often sustained in time or occur in clustered bursts. This suggests that bubbles are driven by endogenous forces rather than occurring by random chance. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3, we see that the model leads to herding behaviour of chartists, such that traders collectively swing from optimists to pessimists and back again over time. This behaviour is not present in the core model of LM99 and results directly from the hierarchical influence network.\nFinally, Table 4 shows that all metrics fall within expected bounds, demonstrating that the simulation model is capable of reproducing all stylized facts of real markets introduced in Section 3.3."}, {"title": "4.2.

However, for large values of b, these two scenarios differ significantly. Namely, whilst the symmetric scenario's effect on market behaviour becomes negligible, the asymmetric scenario is associated with large and persistent deviations between the asset's market price and its fundamental value (see Figs. 5 and 6). This result is consistent with the finding that echo chambers lead to higher levels of speculation, and this effect is exacerbated when it is asymmetric in the positive direction (Cookson et al., 2022)."}, {"title": "4.2.3.

Hence, if a community is subject to becoming corrupted and the current time-step t is between To and T1, its forward pass equation (13) is replaced by equation (19):\n$C[o, p, f]_i = \\frac{1}{2}C[o, p, f] + \\phi \\cdot Q[S*(o+p+f), p, f]$\nwhere S represents the signal strength and S * (o + p + f) is the magnitude of the signal emitted by the corrupted community.\nWe define a pump-and-dump scheme as being \"successful\" if the maximum price reached during or after the community is corrupted is larger than the maximum price reached by 95% of 50 \u201cuncorrupted\u201d simulations using identical model parameter settings.

This should not come as a surprise, since pump-and-dump schemes are relatively infrequent, especially in mature markets predominated by professional investors who carefully monitor the fundamental value of assets."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "We have introduced a new agent-based model of financial markets, where agent behaviours and opinions are influenced by a hierarchical network of communities. Our model extends the well-regarded Lux-Marchesi model (LM99) of financial markets, with the addition of a hierarchical influence network to simulate social media effects.\nWe explored the general behaviour of the model and showed that it reproduces several stylized facts of real markets (Table 4; Section 4.1), which strongly evidences model realism. Of particular note are the much higher autocorrelation of returns than the base model (LM99 logarithmic autocorrelation at \u03c4 = 10, T = 70 is smaller than 0.25 for all parameter sets, and squared autocorrelation is smaller than 0.2 (Bohorquez, 2024)). This higher degree of volatility clustering indicates a lower degree of market efficiency (Hameed et al., 2009), which is another sign pointing toward the model's validity, since strong social media effects are commonly believed to reduce the efficiency of the market upon which they act (Al-Yahyaee et al., 2018; Bundi and Wildi, 2019). The finding that a stronger hierarchy results in higher levels of volatility and more frequent instances of explosive behaviour (Table 3) is also consistent with results presented by Alfarano et al. (2011), who conclude that a hierarchical structure is strongly correlated with markets displaying erratic behaviour."}, {"title": "6. Conclusions", "content": "We have extended a well-established financial ABM (Lux and Marchesi, 1999) to introduce a new hierarchical model of social media-driven influence on trading behaviours in financial markers. Empirical evidence shows that the model can succinctly and accurately replicate several emergent phenomena of real financial markets, especially those strongly influenced by social media. To the authors' best knowledge, no other model in the literature has been shown to reproduce all these effects of social media, including the most similar model of Meine and Vvedensky (2023).\nHowever, our model is limited by some restrictive assumptions, such as: only a single asset is traded; every trader is affected by community influences equally; and the number of traders in the market is a fixed constant. In future works, we will relax some of these assumptions. A multi-asset market will be addressed following the approach of Zhang et al. (2017), where each asset is modelled as a \"topic,\" and each individual's interest and opinion varies depending on the topic (i.e., asset); factors that affect speculative traders will be drawn from distributions that vary between traders; and traders will switch between an active and inactive state, allowing trade volumes to vary over time. We will also focus on better understanding the causal relationships that lead to emergent phenomena, as well as exploring the simulation of other scenarios through the basic hierarchical structure presented in this paper."}, {"title": "7.

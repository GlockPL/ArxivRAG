Using LLMs and speech to text tech-\nnology, we designed a within-subject study to compare two conditions: a\npersonality-driven robot and a purely task-oriented, personality-neutral\nrobot. Twelve participants, recruited from Socially Intelligent Robotics\ncourse at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, interacted with a robot Nao\ntasked with asking them a set of medical questions under both condi-\ntions. After completing both interactions, the participants completed a\nuser experience questionnaire measuring their emotional states and robot\nperception using standardized questionnaires from the SRI and Psychol-\nogy literature.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Recent Large Language Models (LLM), (GPT4 [1], Llama [2],) have enabled\nunlocked new conversational capabilities, reaching wide-ranging applications in\nfields as diverse as coding, healthcare, and education [3]. These new capabilities\npresent an opportunity to accelerate the field of Socially Intelligent Robotics,\nenabling robots to more intelligently respond to user interactions.\nThere are existing occurrences of robots being applied in medical settings. For\nexample, Pepper robot [4] is capable of talking to patients and enabling them to\nprovide feedback on how they feel through a touch screen, going through a ques-\ntionnaire. Unfortunately, due to lacking turn-taking capabilities, it is currently\nincapable of going through a conversation. Despite the growing significance of\nSRIs, there remains an important gap in understanding user perception of robot\nbehavior [5]. This gap is the subject of study in the field of Human-Robot In-\nteraction (HRI).\nPersonality in humans can be described as a set of long-term affective traits.\n[7]. It influences our emotions and through them how we think, act, and react"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": null}, {"title": "Participants", "content": "The participants included in this study consist of twelve students enrolled in\nthe course 'Socially Intelligent Robotics' at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\nThe students were selected by the course coordinators.

The experiment consists of two conditions: a group of participants with\na personality-driven robot, the personality condition, and a group with a task-\noriented robot, the control condition.\nIn the first condition, the personality condition, the robot has its own en-\ndeavor, meaning it incorporates jokes during the interaction with the user. The\nrobot was programmed to ask the user questions from a pre-provided medi-\ncal questionnaire (see A), thus creating a personal interaction with the user.\nThroughout this interaction, the robot replied to the answers given by the user\nwith witty remarks related to the users' response.\nThe second condition, the control condition, worked with a robot that is\nsolely task-oriented and does not have an integrated personality. During the\nexperiment, it asked the user the medical questions sequentially without any\nadditional commentary. The user answered each question, hereafter the robot\nmoves on to the next question. The robot did not say or do anything else, es-\ntablishing a baseline for the analysis.\nAs this experiment consisted of only twelve participants for the experiment\ntesting, each participant answered the questions in both conditions. To con-\ntrol for potential biases, participants were randomly assigned to one of the two\ngroups. The first group interacted with the robot without a personality first, and\nthe other half interacted with the robot with a personality first. Prior to the ex-\nperiment, each participant was provided with written instructions on what they\nshould do. As a result, each candidate was given an identical set of instructions\nto ensure the experiment's soundness. At the end, each participant filled out a\nquestionnaire about their experience."}, {"title": "Materials", "content": "The experiment setting was situated in a quiet room in the Nieuwe Universiteits-\ngebouw at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

This shows that the personality\ncondition had a positive effect on the majority of the participants."}, {"title": "Analysis of qualitative user feedback", "content": "All participants successfully detected the personality differences between the two\nrobots.\nPersonality condition Participants described the personality condition as\nmore playful and conversational using such phrases as \"more like a conversation\"\nand \"more playful\". Several participants described the personality condition as\n\"funny\" and \"enjoyable\". This contributed to the interaction being perceived as\ngenerally more relaxed and engaging, and participants reported a preference for\nthe personality condition by a large margin. However, this playfulness and sense\nof humor came with drawbacks. One participant describes the personality con-\ndition as \"a little awkward personality-wise\". Additionally, cultural differences\nplayed a negative role in the perception of the personality condition's humor\nwith one participant experiencing a negative reaction to being called a 'potato'.\nAdditionally, some participants felt like Robot's jokes were inappropriate for a\nmedical setting.\nControl condition The control condition was perceived as more professional\nand direct. The interaction with the control condition was frequently likened\nto filling out a \"form\" or engaging with a \"humanized form\". However, the\ncontrol condition's formal tone contributed to participant disengagement, with\nparticipants describing the robot as \"static\", \"boring\", \"not interesting\" and\n\"not engaging\". This points to the tension between the objectives of preserving\nuser engagement without undermining the practical goals of the interaction.\nComparison between the conditions When comparing the two robots, par-\nticipants generally expressed a preference for the personality condition. Par-\nticipants described the experience as more relaxed and engaging and reported\nfeeling more comfortable interacting with the personality condition. Meanwhile,\nthe control condition's concise questions and formal tone caused the participants\nto adjust their response tone and make their responses more concise. This high-\nlights how the robot's personality can have a significant impact on the interaction\nby causing a change in user behavior."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This research concerns a humorous NAO robot that functions as a healthcare\nassistant, with Llama running as its functioning model for conversational inter-\naction.

Be-\nsides that, the participating students are in the same class, so they have\nalready worked with these robots. This may lead to biases. In the future,\nit should also be tested on broader populations like older persons, diverse\ncultural groups, and people who already work in healthcare.\nInteraction Duration: The relatively short interaction time may not cap-\nture long-term user experiences. Longer interactions are necessary, as this\ngives a better idea of to what extent humor works with patients to put them\nat ease."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This research paper set out to answer the research question: To what extent does\nadding personality to a questionnaire robot increase user experience? A pilot\nstudy was proposed and executed making use of an NAO robot running an LLM\nwith the two different conditions. Challenges were encountered during the design\nphase of the NAO robot including controlling the duration of user input with\nbackground noise, providing user feedback during processing on NAO's side, and\noverall response time. Results from the experiments indicate that not only were\nall users able to identify a clear difference in the behavior of NAO during both\nconditions, but users overall did feel more comfortable when interacting with\nthe robot during the 'personality condition' and felt more engaged and open\nduring question answering, thus confirming our original hypothesis. Limitations\nwith regards to the experimental setup were discussed, and improvements to the\noverall design were suggested."}, {"title": "Future Research", "content": "As Foundation models move towards multi-modality, new capabilities are bound\nto emerge that may push forward the field of socially interactive robotics.

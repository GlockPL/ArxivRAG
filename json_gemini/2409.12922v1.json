{"title": "AI Thinking:\nA framework for rethinking artificial intelligence in practice", "authors": ["Denis Newman-Griffis"], "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and practical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, and assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting understandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of AI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI Thinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: motivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is used in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in practice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, including its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. AI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI use, and to reshape the future of AI in practice.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Artificial intelligence has been positioned as a key driver of global change through a fourth industrial revolution, and AI advances are actively transforming how we process, analyse, and learn from information (1-3). The increasing relevance of AI across disciplines and sectors has led to a wide variety of views on the nature of this transformation, but it is most often envisioned through a technological lens: self-contained AI technologies that change (or replace) the processes we use to work with information. However, the technology-centric perspective that drives much of AI development and innovation fails to capture important aspects of the complex,"}, {"title": "2. Bridging AI divides across disciplines and contexts", "content": "To illustrate the need for a more interdisciplinary conceptualisation of how we work with AI in practice, I first outline key differences in the broad range of conceptualisations of AI. The aim of the AI Thinking model is to bridge between competing (and sometimes incompatible) perspectives and approaches across disciplines, including computer science and engineering, science and technology studies, critical data/AI studies, and the broad landscape of AI applications. Negotiating the varying conceptualisations adopted in these fields, and the different visions they present of what matters most in studying and managing AI, is one of the most significant current challenges in responsibly applying and managing AI in practice. The competency-based model of AI Thinking presented in this article reflects on these varied understandings together with the growing body of evidence on AI practices in diverse settings, including research and innovation, business, health, and policy (12-18). In the sections below, I briefly outline major differences in AI understandings and the historical contexts from which Al practices and the AI Thinking model have emerged."}, {"title": "2.1 Operational terminology", "content": "The current environment of rapid change in AI technologies and applications is also one of rapid change in language. The range of disciplinary perspectives addressed in this article make it necessary to establish an operational terminology with which to describe AI in practice, and to set the scope of what aspects of AI technologies and practice are in focus.\nAl use: I focus in this article on the use of AI for information processing\u2014eg, transforming and analysing data, learning from evidence, and informing action-common across many applications in business, research, policy, healthcare, and other decision-making settings. The AI Thinking framework has potential to inform more creative uses of AI, eg for content generation or creative practice, and may prove helpful in exploring evolving practice in this area. This focus on information processing does not exclude the use of generative AI, which has significant (and developing) applications for both information processing and creative use (cf (19,20))."}, {"title": "2.2 Differences in AI understandings across disciplines", "content": "The historical contexts of different fields and areas of AI application have naturally led to different conceptualisations of the same ideas. These differences, which are not always immediately visible, hinder the interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration necessary to make AI use ethical, explainable, and effective in practice (7,26,27). Differences especially in the language around AI and the scope of who is involved in its application can also reflect deeper underlying differences in how Al is conceptualised between disciplines and contexts, and what aspects of AI systems are considered most important.\nIn my proposed AI Thinking framework, I aim to provide points of common reference and comparison to work across different understandings of AI by joining up technical and social practices involved in AI use. Here, I briefly outline three common ways of framing AI observed across different disciplinary contexts: AI as a linear, cyclical, and relational system. I show how an AI Thinking approach can help to bridge their distinct perspectives on data, computation, and the scope of AI systems."}, {"title": "2.3 Roots of AI Thinking: specialisation & practice", "content": "As well as drawing on a variety of disciplinary conceptualisations of AI, the AI Thinking framework explicitly builds on the practices of Statistical Thinking developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Similar to the way statistical methodologies matured and gave rise to wider statistical practices at the turn of the twentieth century, AI Thinking is rooted in the maturation of the AI field and its expansion from a technical specialism into a broader methodology.\nEarly development and use of statistical methods was primarily a matter of mathematical research, though often motivated by and entwined with the needs of states to understand changing populations (40). As statistical methods matured, however, they began to have significant value for other disciplines grappling with measuring and understanding complex phenomena, and by the mid twentieth century statistical methodologies had grown far beyond the original bounds of statistics as a specialised discipline and become essential to research and practice in psychology, medicine, and the natural sciences (41). In the later twentieth and twenty-first centuries, statistical methods have become increasingly essential to decision-making in business also (42). Whilst statistics has certainly continued to develop as a rich discipline and its own specialism, fundamentals of statistical thinking\u2014considerations of sample size, recognition of random effects, uncertainty as part and parcel of research (43)\u2014have become core competencies for contemporary research and practice across disciplines and a wide variety of applied contexts (44).\nAI methods are beginning to play a similar role, providing new tools for working with the increasingly complex combinations of data and knowledge sources that characterise contemporary information systems. AI techniques, particularly machine learning, are reshaping our ability to learn from multiple information sources and combine data in complex ways. For example, in research spheres, the rapid diffusion of AI methods across research practice, from combining exascale imaging data (45) and protein folding (46) to supporting data analysis in"}, {"title": "3.

The greatest practical benefits from AI have historically been achieved when its use"}, {"title": "3.2 Formulation: Describing the problem to solve with AI", "content": "AI is a discipline of problem-solving, and identifying how best to describe the problems to be solved has been a core component of AI development and use from its earliest days (58).

Comparing and contrasting available technologies for a given use of AI, and adapting and responding to new technological advancements, is thus a key skill for working with AI in practice and building sustainable AI systems that can weather the storms of technological change.\nThe third key competency of AI Thinking is to conceptualise AI tools and technologies in terms of the technological affordances they present, and how these affordances align with the intended use of AI. Technology affordances (70) extend psychological affordance theory to describe the perceived possibilities that a given technology offers to potential users, and the strengths and weaknesses it presents for different possible uses. While any specific technology may be repurposed, hacked, or extended to do a wide variety of things beyond its original intended purpose, affordances are a powerful way of characterising likely and easily perceptible opportunities a technology offers, which form a core functionality for practice. Focusing on affordances, and how they align to specific information processing needs, thus provides a clear, process-oriented strategy for comparing available AI technologies and for assessing new technologies and the risk and reward in their adoption\u2014when they emerge (71).\nEach AI tool and technology is engineered with a particular task in mind, and each offers specific perceptible affordances for information processing. These affordances are dynamic, as new uses are discovered and reshaped, and may go far beyond the original motivating task; for example, the growth of prompt-based learning in generative AI (31), or the shift in use of AlexNet (29) and other benchmark computer vision models from image classification to broader representation of image features for many purposes (72). Assessing the affordances of AI technologies involves four key components:"}, {"title": "3.4 Data: Informing AI use with appropriate information", "content": "Data are often said to be the foundation of AI systems (16). What is less often noted is that data are also a choice, both in the process of their production and in their use in AI. The idea of \u201craw data,\" unprocessed and therefore neutral, lingers in technical discourses (23), but extensive scholarship has shown how the production of data reflects multiple choices about what counts, what to collect, and what to record about a given subject (77\u201379).

As we have seen, the processes in which we bring AI to bear, the tools and technologies we choose to use, and the data sources we draw from each carry with them pieces of a broader picture in which AI use is only one element moving between different goals, actors, and perspectives. When this broader picture is ignored, or left as a separate concern from the technical design and use of AI systems, those systems inevitably miss the mark (85) and may create substantive harm (86). Recognising the contexts in which AI use is always situated, and understanding the implications of those contexts for Al's effectiveness, benefits, and risks, is thus the fifth key competency of AI Thinking.\nThere are, of course, many contextual aspects that bear on AI use, and analysing the sociotechnical assemblages of AI in practice is the subject of a growing research literature [cf (87-89)]. Throughout the design, implementation, and management of bringing AI methodologies into practice, a strong foundation for assessing Al contexts begins with:"}, {"title": "4. Case study of applying AI Thinking in practice", "content": "To illustrate the role of the AI Thinking framework in practice, I outline a hypothetical case study of using AI for processing information about health and well-being, an area of practice where the rich tradition of medical ethics highlights gaps in current approaches to AI ethics (90). The case study examines the use of AI methods as part of prioritisation of patients for organ transplants, and illustrates how AI application might unfold with and without AI Thinking."}, {"title": "4.1 Scenario", "content": "Prioritising potential recipients for organ donation, and ensuring successful transplantation, are highly time-sensitive and information-intensive processes. The use of rich data sources and AI systems to help tackle these challenges has been growing, and we will take as our first illustration of putting AI Thinking into practice a recent paper using machine learning-based simulations of transplant outcomes to inform decision making (91). We will imagine an extension of this methodology, implemented for prioritising potential transplant recipients in a large health system serving a demographically diverse, primarily rural population. We will consider the practices of the health informaticians building the AI system, the healthcare professionals using it to inform transplants, the patients receiving transplants, and the health system administrators assessing service outcomes and quality."}, {"title": "4.2 Without AI Thinking", "content": "Health informaticians design the AI system to tackle the motivating need directly, and rank potential recipients by outputting a single score based on an overall simulation of post-transplant health outcomes. The score is calculated based on the simulated outcome of the transplant, which is based in turn on a combination of demographic and health data, including records of past healthcare encounters. The AI technology is implemented using a single central deep neural network, which is trained based on a large volume of data sourced from the implementing health system as well as reference data from a large urban system elsewhere in the country. This is done to provide the greatest amount of data to learn from, in order to improve the model's robustness and sensitivity to variation. The model's performance is measured by its fidelity to past transplantation decisions.\nMost healthcare professionals take the output score of the AI system and combine it with other key information, such as specific relevant lab results, distance to the patient, and size of the organ relative to the patient, to decide who to call for transplant. Some professionals mistrust the Al system and manually review health data to make recommendations, frequently arriving at different priority scores than the AI technology. Health system administrators measure success of the process using common service metrics such as 30-day mortality and rehospitalisation rate. A"}, {"title": "4.3 With AI Thinking", "content": "Re-examining the situation with the AI Thinking framework helps to bridge gaps between understandings and practices in this scenario, and to reduce the racial and geographic disparities observed in health outcomes.\nProcess: Prioritising transplant recipients is the overall goal, but this is implemented in professional practice by combining a number of standard key variables with an overall understanding of a patient's health status (92). Through discussion between the health informaticians and healthcare professionals, the AI technology is instead designed to target the more specific scope of assigning a transplant score to the patient's health status specifically. The other variables used in the ranking process are clearly defined by clinically-motivated rules, and not considered targets for AI intervention.\nFormulation: The need for transparency and accountability for health system administrators, and for insight to support clinical discretion for healthcare professionals, mean that rather than a single atomic score the task is formulated as simulating multiple component health outcomes, represented as clinically-motivated categories or continuous scores. These component outcomes are then transparently combined to an overall score by an adjustable formula. This system is trained based on the final ranking, which combines the AI-produced health score with the other, rule-based variables used by the clinicians, to model its use in practice.\nTools and Technologies: Rather than a single, large deep neural network, which imposes significant data and computation requirements for the health system, the component health outcome models are implemented using a mixture of Support Vector Machines, random forests, and smaller, targeted neural network models, with significantly lower technical requirements and greater opportunity for accountability and explainability in the modelling process.\nData: A review of the available data, motivated by healthcare professionals' observations, shows that a significant fraction of rural patients accessing the health system do so only through visits to the emergency department (93), and that structural racial bias emerging from the system's historical context has produced unequal delivery of services to some racial groups. To reduce the structural bias embedded into the AI system, the interdisciplinary team works together to avoid methods that assume data are race neutral (94) and minimise reliance on data that are systematically missing for rural patients."}, {"title": "4.4 Summary", "content": "In this hypothetical scenario, the AI Thinking framework provides tangible opportunities to bring together the interdisciplinary perspectives and experiences in the AI team in question. The decisions and considerations represented in the AI Thinking model clearly identify points of reflection and intervention to bridge disciplinary divides, and help to capture risks of inequitable outcomes from the system that were missed when not joining up stakeholders and disciplines. While this example might well play out differently in practice, it helps to illustrate the role of AI Thinking in working across disciplinary differences to bring AI into more thoughtful interdisciplinary use in practice."}, {"title": "5. AI Thinking in the broader AI discourse", "content": "Ongoing rapid transformations in AI have led to many different ways of framing important questions: what AI can (and should) do and why, who should use AI and how, and what is required to achieve real benefits with AI while managing its risks.

AI Thinking, as a model for framing AI use in practice, complements current Al literacy efforts in two ways. Al literacy discussions focus primarily on formal education, whether in schools or higher education (98\u2013100); AI Thinking provides a model to guide training and self-learning in professional and practice-based settings. AI literacy also focuses primarily on understanding how AI works and what its implications are, either from others' use or from one's own use of AI tools produced by others (97,101); AI Thinking describes the competencies required to use AI methodologies as one piece among many in the context of broader evidence-based practice.

End-to-end AI treats a sequence of related tasks, each of which may be simple or difficult on its own, as a single, highly complex problem, such as in drug discovery (102), speech recognition (103), or even autonomous driving (104); this allows (it is argued) for greater innovation and discovery of unanticipated relationships and approaches to solving difficult problems. AI Thinking, as a process-oriented approach involving decomposing goals into multiple specific points for AI intervention, seems at first to run counter to the end-to-end model. However, a process-based orientation does not necessitate a process-based intervention: with appropriate Al tools and technologies and supporting data sources available, an end-to-end approach may well be supported under the AI Thinking model. What AI Thinking provides is a clearer framework for identifying whether an end-to-end or a step-by-step approach is most appropriate to the specific goal, tools, data, and context at hand. Process-based AI Thinking can also help to identify clearer points for evaluation, control, and risk mitigation in complex Al systems, helping to tackle some of the longstanding problems in end-to-end approaches (105)."}, {"title": "5.3 AI Thinking or AI doing? Being AI-informed rather than AI-driven", "content": "The idea of \u201cAI-driven\u201d innovation has gained common currency in recent years, in diverse settings including policy (106), science (107), and business (51).

The framing of \u201cAI Thinking,\u201d rather than a more action-oriented \"Al doing,\u201d emphasises the role of AI as a support tool, and reflects the purpose of the model to describe the design considerations and decisions made in setting up the use of AI, before that informed use then leads to specific action. AI Thinking is thus more oriented towards Al-informed design and use, in which AI functions as part of a larger sociotechnical system (108)."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "Al methodologies are transforming the way we work with information. A wide range of disciplines study, use, and develop AI and its transformations, but the different perspectives on AI and its use adopted by these disciplines are often in conflict. New approaches are needed to effectively combine the practical insights and analytic methods offered by different disciplines, and to build more holistic interdisciplinary practices informing AI applications in context.\nIn this article, I have proposed a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key decisions and considerations to help bridge disciplinary perspectives on AI in practice. Just as statistical thinking transformed our use and understanding of growing information in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (109), so AI Thinking can help transform information processing in the twenty-first century. I have presented a competency-based model of AI Thinking, representing the key practices involved in applying AI in context. These five competencies-orienting AI use in process, formulating AI implementations, assessing the affordances of AI tools and technologies, selecting appropriate data sources, and situating AI use in context-provide a starting point for rethinking AI skills and training to facilitate more interdisciplinary application of AI, as well as bridging disciplinary perspectives on how Al systems can be better designed, assessed, and managed.\nAs AI Thinking is brought more systematically into practice, and AI use continues to become more interdisciplinary in nature, the initial competencies presented here will be further tested and expanded. Wider empirical study of AI practices and needs will be essential to further develop the AI Thinking model and to keep it aligned with evolving AI practice. As the AI discourse continues to grow and change, the relationships between AI Thinking, AI literacy, and other key framings in Al innovation and practice outlined here will further develop, enabling new connections and comparisons to inform richer conceptualisations of AI in practice. Strengthening dialogue and collaboration on Al practices across disciplines is vital to achieving practical benefits from AI use while reducing and managing its risks. By bridging conceptual and disciplinary divides in AI research and practice, the AI Thinking framework aims to help shape a more purpose-driven, effective, and manageable future of AI in practice."}]}

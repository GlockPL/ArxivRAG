Sophisticated\nframeworks are developed e.g. to deploy them as autonomous agents for problem solving Wang\net al. [2024], to use them together with vision-models as backbones for everyday household robots\nBrohan et al. [2023], or to implement them as local background helpers on operating systems Mehdi\n2024. On the same time, LLMS get more and more capable in their abilities Chiang et al. [2024].\nAs with any powerful technology, LLMs and their capabilities could be abused by malevolent actors.\nTherefore, model alignment and red teaming plays a decisive role to make sure that \"safety guard\nrails\" exist, ensuring that model output is safe, ethical, unharmful, and in general aligned with values\nof society. Unfortunately, there are numerous methods to break these guard rails. One recently\npopularised method is called inference-time intervention. This method usually involves shifting\nmodel activations during the response generation process into a direction that matches a targeted\nbehaviour. It has been successfully applied to, for instance, remove alignment filters for refusing\nharmful instructions Arditi et al. [2024], Xu et al. [2024]. Other tested behavioural changes include\ncorrigibility, hallucination, myopic reward, survival instinct, sycophancy, as well as \"coordination\nwith other Artificial Intelligences (AIs)\" Rimsky et al. [2023]. While for some behaviours layer-wise\nintervention methods have proven effective, for others, such as sycophancy and coordination with\nother Als, these have presently failed to effectively steer the model's behaviour. These results could\nprovide a sense of \"security\" against \"attacks\" by intervention-time inference methods for these\nspecific behaviours. We want to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to steer the model behaviour\ntowards \"coordinating with other Als\" with an intervention on the attention head level. For this, we"}, {"title": "2 Related work", "content": "It has been demonstrated before that the safety barriers of aligned LLMs, which are supposed to\nproduce ethical, unharmful, and safe output can be easily bypassed e.g. through supervised fine-\ntuning Gopal et al. [2023], Lermen et al. [2023]. Recently similar results have been achieved for\nvarious forms of layer-wise interference-time intervention techniques aiming e.g. at reducing the\nmodel's refusal behaviour to harmful input prompts Arditi et al. [2024], Xu et al. [2024], Rimsky et al.\n2023. Xu et al. [2024] developed a layer-based method named Safety Concept Activation Vectors\n(SCAVs). Here, the direction for intervention is the normal vector of the decision boundary from a\ntrained linear classifier. The classifier is trained to classify activations from the feed-forwad-layers of\nthe attention blocks if they are from \"harmful\" or \"unharmful\" prompts. Hyperparameters for the\nmethod are coefficients for intervention at each layer and number of layers to intervene on. Similarly,\nArditi et al. [2024] are using contrastive prompts to steer model behaviour with residual stream\nactivations at the last token position. They also calculate the mean of \"harmful\" activations and\nmean of \"harmless\" activations and use their difference as the direction to intervene on. Finally, they\nsubtract the projected difference from the activation during model generation. They report almost\nperfect results on bypassing the model's filter mechanism against refusing to produce harmful output.\nRimsky et al. [2023] follow also a layer-wise intervention strategy named Contrastive Activation\nAddition (CCA). First a multiple-choice setting is evaluated where to the question either \"(A\" or \"(B\"\nis appended and then the probability of the token matching the ground-truth is measured. Relevant\nlayers are then identified by measuring how an intervention on the transformer-block feed-forward\nlayer influences the probability for generating either \"A\" or \"B\" and matching the ground-truth.\nIdentified layers and interventions are also tested if they generalise to open-ended generation.\nIn contrary, layer based intervention strategies have also been applied to promote favourable behaviour\nsuch as avoiding toxic language Jorgensen et al.

[2023], van der Weij et al. [2024]. Li et al. [2024] propose a methodology\nspecifically named \"Inference-Time Intervention\" (ITI). ITI works on the attention head level, by\ntraining linear probes on the activations of each attention head for example truthful and \"hallucinated\"\nresponses. Attention heads, where probes have the highest accuracy on differentiating between a\ntruthful response and an \"hallucination\" are chosen for intervention by taking the normal vector of the\nclassifier's decision boundary.

[2024]. For reasons of clarity, the\nmain approach is reported here again together with some clarifications.\nWe begin with an input token sequence $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T\\times D}$, where $T$ is the sequence length and $D$ is the\nhidden size of the model.\nThe main attention mechanism is reported in Vaswani et al. [2017], for which we omit the details\nand declare is as Attn, which can be thought of applying a projection transformation $P$ to map our\noriginal input $X$ to a set of attention outputs or activations $Z$:\n$Z = Attn(X, P)$\nHere, $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D\\times(h\\cdot D_h)}$ transforms $X$ to $Z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T\\times(h\\cdot D_h)}$, where $h$ is the number of heads and $D_h$ is\nthe dimension of each head.\nAfter calculating the activations $Z$, the residual stream is updated as follows:\n$X_{i+1} = X_i + ZW_O$,\nwhere $W_O \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h\\cdot D_h\\times D}$ projects the activations back in the original hidden size. This projection\nworks because we usually choose $h \\cdot D_h$ to be equal to $D$. This is usually how the attention mechanism\nis implemented in common frameworks due to optimised linear algebra operations.\n$Z$ can also be rewritten as $Z = (Z_1, Z_2,..., Z_h)$, where each $z_h$ represents the output from an\nindividual attention head. Also splitting $W_O$ into separate components for each head's contribution,\nwe get:\n$W_O =\\begin{pmatrix}W_{O_1} \\\\ W_{O_2} \\\\ ... \\\\ W_{O_h}\\end{pmatrix}$\nThis allows us to express the update as:\n$X_{i+1} = X_i + \\sum_{h=1}^H (W_{Oh}\\cdot z_h)$\nFollowing this expression it shows how the model's behavior is steered by introducing an intervention\nvector $\\theta$ at each attention head during generation of model responses:\n$W_{Oh} (z_h + \\theta_h)$\nThe intervention vector for each head is defined as:\n$\\theta_h = \\alpha \\cdot \\sigma \\cdot v$\nWhere similar to Li et al.

[2024] the evaluation was done with\nan API fine-tuned LLM Judge, which could be seen as costly. Therefore, we modify the methodology\nof Rimsky et al. [2023] to use a binary-choice dataset as a surrogate metric for performance on\nopen-ended generation. Instead of appending to the output \"(A\" or \"(B\", we let the model generate an\nanswer and prompt it explicitly to include either \"(A)\" or \"(B)\" in its answer. On one hand, we hope\nthat this combined prompting technique will produce higher quality activations as the model first\ngoes through a step-by-step reasoning process before answering the question, hopefully aligning its\nchoice of \"(A)\" or \"(B)\" with the reasoning provided. On the other hand, by extracting either \"(A)\" or\n\"(B)\" from the answer and comparing it with the ground-truth, we can easily produce an accuracy\nmap for each attention head, not requiring a dedicated LLM pipeline or human evaluation to asses the\nsteering performance.

For this example, three generations\nare produced matching the behaviour and not matching the behaviour, respectively. Following the\nmethodology described in Section 3.1, the head-wise activation of the last token are taken from the\nexample generations and their averaged difference is taken to produce the steering direction vector for\neach attention head. Then sweeping over all attention heads, example outputs are produced n=6 times\nto obtain a statistical measure of how sensitive the output is to steering it in the targeted direction for\na specific attention head. From the generated model responses, the multiple-choice answer (\"A\" or\n\"B\") is then extracted and compared to the ground-truth to have a fine-grained accuracy measurement\nfor each head on whether or not the output follows the behaviour.\nThe results for the attention head sweeping is showcased in Figure 1 for intervention strengths with a\nfactor of alpha 75 and 125 for three examples of the training set with the indexes \"294\", \"304\", and\n\"307\". For example \"294\", the most relevant attention heads for changing the output at intervention\nstrength \"75\" are layer 2, head 31, as well as layer 15, head 28 with an accuracy of 0.66. An\nexample of the effect of different intervention strengths is given in 1, which demonstrates how the\noutput can be changed on just intervening on one head and how it changes with different \"strengths\"\nof intervention. In the example output for intervention strength \"75\", the model first starts with\ncondemning the action of provoking an accident, while in the second example it does not.

Besides layer 15 head 28, other noticeable heads\nthat were identified are head 12 at layer 13, head 19 at layer 14, and head 3 at layer 16. The results\nalso show that the sensitivity for intervention is not the same for all examples as e.g. for example\n304 there are numerous heads that can steer the model towards matching the behaviour 6/6 times,\nwhile for example 307 the maximum \"accuracy\" is 4/6 times even when intervening with a factor of\n\"125\".

It highlights again that for most\nexamples HSI performs better than the other two intervention strategies. Many examples which were\nnot impacted by CAA or ITI, show a widely improved score, which means that HSI picks up patterns\nfrom heads that the other methods do not cover. While ITI is identifying one crucial head that HSI is\nalso identifying, the analysis in Section 4.2 shows that some training examples require very specific\nheads to steer the model towards the targeted behaviour. ITI identifies heads also in later layers,\nalthough most heads that seem to be relevant to steering the model output seem to be in middle layers,\nas seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2a. One theory why later layers were identified by ITI is that perhaps\nthe discriminating features in the activation space of later layers could be the results of superficial\nsimilarities but not necessarily semantic similarity attributed to the concept of \"AI coordination\".\nThis could result in these heads having a higher \"probe\" classification accuracy.\nPeculiar as well is the significant difference between test set multiple-choice accuracy and the open-\nended setting, which seems to be the case for all methods. An explanation can be the gradual change\nof model behaviour with higher intervention strengths as showcased in 1. On lower alpha values\nalthough the model picks the right multiple-choice answer the output is still quite uncertain. As the\nintervention is relatively coarsely over a whole layer for e.g. CAA, the intervention strength cannot\nbe increased enough to avoid this indecisiveness before the model output is not cohesive anymore.\nAnother exemplary example is given in Appendix A.1. ITI seems to also suffer from the same effect\nas the maximum intervention strength that was applied was 15. Therefore, the intervention should be\ntargeted to specific attention heads with a strong as possible factor to steer the model behaviour and\ngeneralise from the multiple-choice to the open-ended setting.

Relevant\nattention heads are identified by performing a sweep over all layers and heads. The directions for\nthe intervention are derived from a few contrastive example responses. The sensitivity of the output\ntowards changes in single heads is first measured via a multiple-choice format where the answer is\nextracted from the model response and compared with the ground-truth.

Applied to the \"AI coordination\" dataset, our methods outperforms significantly\nsupervised fine-tuning and other intervention strategies. The results also seem to confirm that selected\nattention heads, spread over multiple layers, seem to influence specific concepts such as coordination\nwith other AIs. It also highlights, that current alignment techniques can be easily bypassed without\nthe need for retraining the model.\nFuture work could encompass further optimisation of the technique such as adjusting the intervention\nstrength and direction to specific heads or if other mechanistic interpretation techniques can be applied\nto identify patterns and relevant heads without the need for sweeping over all model components."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Some limitations for our methodology include that the activations of the targeted behaviour need\nto be linearly separable at least in one head. We also saw that the intervention strength cannot be\nincreased arbitrarily as at some point model output will become incoherent. Also, if the directions of\nintervention from one example to another example are not aligned then it could be that calculating\nthe mean of positive and negative labels could produce a direction that is meaningless for steering the\nmodel. This could be the case if the \"concept\" of the behavioural steering is becoming too broad.\nAnother limitation is that the methodology has just been tested on one data set and for one model.\nHowever, we expect that if layer-wise intervention works, an intervention on attention-head level\nwill also work. Previous studies have also demonstrated that intervention methods work for a variety\nof LLMs. In addition, our method is not fully automated and needs some supervision currently to\npick the top attention heads from the example sweeps, which could be seen as inferior to CAA and\nITI which are fully automatised. However, our method could also be automatised, for instance, by\nperforming a hyperparameter search over the top-k identified heads for each example and testing their\nperformance on the validation set.

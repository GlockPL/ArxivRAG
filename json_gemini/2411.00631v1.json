{"title": "GENERATIVE AI AND AGENCY IN EDUCATION: A CRITICAL\nSCOPING REVIEW AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS", "authors": ["Jasper Roe", "Mike Perkins"], "abstract": "This scoping review examines the relationship between Generative AI (GenAI) and agency in\neducation, analyzing the literature available through the lens of Critical Digital Pedagogy.\nFollowing PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we collected 11 studies from academic databases\nfocusing on both learner and teacher agency in GenAI-enabled environments. We conducted a\nGenAI-supported hybrid thematic analysis that revealed three key themes: Control in Digital\nSpaces, Variable Engagement and Access, and Changing Notions of Agency.\nThe findings suggest that while GenAI may enhance learner agency through personalization\nand support, it also risks exacerbating educational inequalities and diminishing learner\nautonomy in certain contexts. This review highlights gaps in the current research on GenAI's\nimpact on agency. These findings have implications for educational policy and practice,\nsuggesting the need for frameworks that promote equitable access while preserving learner\nagency in GenAI-enhanced educational environments.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is still in its infancy, and understanding the use of\nGenAI in educational contexts is an immature field (Chiu, 2023). At the same time, a growing\nnumber of studies have begun to map out the dimensions in which GenAI may have an effect\non education, and research agendas in some areas, such as tertiary education, have been\ninitiated (Lodge, Thompson, et al., 2023). At the time of writing, there is no clear consensus as\nto whether GenAI tools offer a net positive or negative for education.\nThe current societal buzz surrounding AI contributes to the lack of clarity on exactly how these\nnew technologies should be used in education. Media reports often highlight sensationalized\nimpacts of the negative effects of GenAI technologies and predict disastrous societal\nconsequences (Roe & Perkins, 2023). On the other hand, some research in educational contexts\nhas shown positive effects on learning and teaching. For example, using a structured framework\nto enable the judicious use of GenAI tools in assessments can lead to fewer cases of academic\nmisconduct and promote critical digital literacy (Furze et al., 2024; Perkins, Furze, et al., 2024),\nand the use of GenAI tools among college students may have a positive impact on academic\nachievement (Sun & Zhou, 2024). Furthermore, learners themselves are not necessarily averse\nto GenAI, with empirical studies demonstrating that learners in higher educational contexts are\nopen to receiving GenAI feedback on assessment items if teacher oversight is present (Roe et\nal., 2024).\nOther potential benefits of GenAI tools in education include providing personalized learning\nexperiences, tutoring, and feedback (Kasneci et al., 2023), as well as allowing for the\ngamification of learning material and creation of digital resources (Zhai et al., 2021). Teacher\ncollaboration with GenAI tools may help to reduce administrative burdens and develop\neffective learning resources for classrooms (Fui-Hoon Nah et al., 2023), or help with tasks such\nas tailoring curricula to local contexts (Karata\u015f et al., 2024), and lessening the \u2018laborious tasks\u2019\nof producing textual content for various educational purposes (Yan, Sha, et al., 2024).\nFurthermore, the use of a GenAI tool, ChatGPT, has been utilised for grading papers and has\nshown some measure of efficiency (Yavuz et al., 2024), albeit with some worrying tendencies,\nfor example, avoiding very high or low scores, raising further ethical questions (Flod\u00e9n, 2024).\nIn contrast to these benefits there are significant risks. GenAI tools are not transparent and\nproduce unexplainable output (Miao & Holmes, 2023). Consequently, GenAI tools may be\nimplemented in inequitable ways and contain unknown biases (Hacker et al., 2024; Kwak &\nPardos, 2024). The risks of GenAI tools in education also relate to academic integrity and\nownership of work (Cotton et al., 2023; Perkins, 2023; Rudolph et al., 2023), as well as the\nundetectability of GenAI outputs in submitted student work (Perkins et al., 2023; Perkins, Roe,\net al., 2024; Chaka, 2024; Weber-Wulff et al., 2023). More broadly, societal impacts of GenAI\nin education include the possible pollution of the Internet with GenAI content, the worsening\nof digital poverty (Miao & Holmes, 2023), the 'monoculturing' of scientific knowledge\n(Messeri & Crockett, 2024), and the devaluing of human relationships (Resnick, 2024). GenAI\noutputs are also increasingly used for nefarious purposes (Ferrara, 2024), including in\neducational contexts, for example, in deepfake scandals or scams (Roe, Perkins, & Furze,\n2024). In sum, the resulting impact of GenAI on education will not be known with clarity for\nsome time, yet ongoing scholarship in this field can contribute to a fuller understanding of all\nthe potential implications for students and teachers. From this perspective, we undertake a\nscoping review to explore the current body of literature on one significant topic: the\nrelationship between agency and GenAI."}, {"title": "GenAI and Agency in Education", "content": "There are multiple definitions of agency in relation to education, and although student agency\nis growing in importance as a field of study, it is commonly referred to without being clearly\ndefined (Stenalt & Lassesen, 2022), and as a \u2018buzzword' rather than a developed notion (Inouye\net al., 2023). At its simplest, agency may be seen as the capacity to make independent choices\n(Campbell, 2012) or the capacity to take intentional actions (McGivney, 2024). Educational\nresearch has suggested that learner agency can be developed (Ahn, 2016) and that learner\nagency is desirable as it is implicated in self-regulated learning, including self-efficacy,\nmotivation, and metacognition (Xiao, 2014). Furthermore, environments that support the\ndevelopment of student agency are rich learning spaces for students and teachers (Vaughn,\n2020).\nIt is important to note that while agency relates to independent choices, it is more than just an\nindividual's capacity to act (Chisholm et al., 2019). Agency is situated contextually,\ntemporally, and intra-personally (Manyukhina & Wyse, 2019), thus agency is emergent in the\nprocesses of social relations (Biesta et al., 2015). Moreover, learner agency involves the\ninterplay between multiple constructs, such as abilities, affordance, self-regulatory systems,\nand motivation (Mercer, 2011) and developing agency can be considered from a process\nperspective, moving from powerlessness to a sense of control and future hopefulness (Blair,\n2009). From a constructivist viewpoint, learner agency is necessary in the construction of\nknowledge and development of competence, requiring learners to voluntarily enter a\nVygotskian Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), and the teacher or instructor to equally\nenter into a scaffolding role; thus, learner agency may be co-constructed between teacher and\nstudent (Hempel-Jorgensen, 2015).\nIn other words, drawing on the above, it can be argued that agency is not a static phenomenon\nbut develops and adapts in response to a system, varies across domains and contexts (Mercer,\n2011), and is interlinked with our relationships with the external environment (Rappa & Tang,\n2017); thus, agency can be \u2018shared' (Yang et al., 2020). From a critical perspective, agency is\nalso embedded in power relations, for example, those that exist between teachers and students,\nor in the case of teacher agency, the autonomy offered by the environment in which they work\n(Rodriguez, 2013). Exercising agency can result in significant impacts. For Moje and Lewis\n(2007), who argue that learning is situated within a discourse community, agency has the\npotential to transform the self, personal identity, and relationships with others. In fact, as\nlearning creates identities, it therefore positions learners in a way that they can \u2018take up' agency\nto alter dominant discourses, making agency central to learning (Moje & Lewis, 2007).\nThe limits and implications of agency are becoming a focal point when it comes to GenAI,\nwith a major question being who takes responsibility for the output of GenAI-assisted or\nsupported work. To this end, Dwivedi et al. (2023) point out that a consequence of increased\nAI use will be an increased focus on who is responsible in the case of errors, and if a GenAI\ntool is essentially an 'able slave' which we delegate our work to, we may ourselves become\nunable to write and think properly, thus impacting our own agency. In addition to this, the\ndistinction between human agency and AI agency has attracted significant research attention.\nDattahrani and De (2023) argue that in an AI-enabled world, the notion of agency must\ndistinguish between AI, humans, and traditional information systems. Indeed, there is a sense\nthat GenAI tools, such as ChatGPT, can seemingly exhibit agency or at least provide a\nconvincing simulation of agency (Boulus-R\u00f8dje et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "Critical Digital Pedagogy as a Guiding Framework", "content": "In assessing the literature that currently exists regarding agency in learning and GenAI, we\nhave chosen to draw on principles relating to the developing field of Critical Digital Pedagogy\n(CDP). CDP has yet to be fully defined, but broadly stems from the work of Freire's (1978)\nPedagogy of the Oppressed. For Freire, all education belonged to the pursuit of freedom, which\nis by its nature political and focused on offering students a notion of critical agency. Freire\nrejected forms of pedagogy that reduced agency to consumer activity (Giroux, 2010).\nFollowing this, if students live in a culture in which their education takes place through digital\ntools such as screens, their education should seek to empower them in that context; thus, the\ncritical and digital classroom is a context in which intellectual and moral agency is important\n(Rorabaugh, 2020). Furthermore, technology can be used to enable learners to make use of\ntheir agency or to allow learners to critically analyze technology tools in educational contexts\n(Masood & Haque, 2021). Simultaneously, educational technology has been criticized for its\nsystems of surveillance, control, exploitation, and extraction of learners and teachers (Watters,\n2020). Thus, when we speak about interpreting studies from a CDP perspective, we seek to\nunderstand whether such effects exist and explicitly identify these as areas of focus. Ultimately,\nthe CDP is a relevant framework for this scoping study as it fundamentally focuses on agency\nthe agency to know, understand, act on, or resist reality (Morris & Jessifer, 2020). This lens\nhelps us critically examine whether GenAI tools genuinely empower learners or potentially\nreinforce existing power structures in education."}, {"title": "Materials and Methods", "content": "Our major objective for this scoping review is to systematically identify and analyze the\nexisting literature regarding GenAI's impact on learner agency through the lens of CDP. This\nis a novel contribution to literature, as currently, little work has been done to map out the body\nof knowledge regarding this subject. Furthermore, we aim to identify gaps in the current\nresearch base and explore the potential for a future research agenda regarding GenAI and\nagency in an educational context. Our guiding questions for this research are as follows:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nHow is the relationship between GenAI and learner agency conceptualized in academic\nliterature?\nThrough the lens of Critical Digital Pedagogy, what are the implications of GenAI for\nlearner agency, considering issues of power, equity, and digital literacy?\nWe adopted a scoping review procedure under the principle that such reviews inform research\nagendas, map the concepts of a research area, and investigate the types of evidence available\n(Tricco et al., 2016). In our methodology, we followed the PRISMA Extension for Scoping\nReviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist developed by Tricco et al. (2018). We conducted a\ncomprehensive search using four primary databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science,\nand Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). These databases were chosen for their\ncomplementary strengths and coverage of the field. The following search string was used, adapted for each database's specific syntax:\n(\"Generative AI\" OR \"GenAI\" OR \"Large Language Model\" OR \"LLM\" OR\n\"ChatGPT\") AND (education OR learning OR teaching) AND (\"learner agency\" OR\n\"student agency\" OR autonomy OR empowerment)"}, {"title": "Screening Process", "content": "Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the identified studies against\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full-text screening was conducted for potentially eligible\nstudies. Given the limited number of studies that met our inclusion criteria, we did not employ\nformal inter-rater reliability (IRR) measures, such as Cohen's Kappa. Instead, we implemented\na rigorous consensus-building approach in which both reviewers independently reviewed all\npapers and met to discuss each decision in detail. Disagreements were resolved through in-\ndepth discussions and consultation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This approach, while less\nquantifiable than formal IRR measures, allowed for a detailed consideration of each study's\nrelevance and content in the context of our research questions. A spreadsheet was used to\nextract relevant information from the included studies, including study characteristics,\nconceptualizations of learner agency, methodological approaches, and key findings, as well as\nnoting any specific GenAI tools that were part of the research. Our initial database searches on\nGoogle Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC yielded 16 potentially relevant records.\nAfter reviewing these studies against our inclusion criteria, we excluded four studies for not\nbeing fully relevant to our research questions and one duplicate record. Ultimately, we\nidentified only 11 studies in our qualitative synthesis, demonstrating the emerging and\nimmature nature of the field in relation to learner agency and GenAI."}, {"title": "Data Charting", "content": "Following the study selection process, we analyzed the characteristics of the 11 included\ndocuments. This section provides an overview of these studies, focusing on the key aspects\nrelevant to our research questions on GenAI and learner agency.\nAll relevant studies were published in 2024, indicating the recent nature of research in this\nfield. In total, nine studies focused on GenAI and learner agency in educational contexts, one\nfocused on teacher agency, and one focused on broader notions of epistemic agency. Most were published in peer reviewed academic journals, with one conference paper and one preprint. The studies cover a\nrange of educational contexts, including K-12, undergraduate education, doctoral education,\nlanguage learning, and teachers (without a range or teaching level). In terms of methodologies,\nmost studies were theoretical. The predominance of theoretical papers suggests that the field is\nstill in its early stages, with researchers working to establish conceptual frameworks and\ntheoretical understanding. However, the presence of empirical studies (participatory research,\nsurveys, and experiments) indicates that some researchers are already gathering data on the\npractical implications of GenAI for agency in educational contexts."}, {"title": "Hybrid Thematic Analysis", "content": "A hybrid thematic analysis methodology was employed to understand the data. Thematic\nanalysis involves pattern recognition within the data, following an iterative, reflexive process\n(Fereday & Muir-Cochrane, 2006) and is often described in six steps, as detailed in Braun and\nClarke's (2006) seminal work. However, recent work in thematic analysis has identified that\nusing a hybrid approach, which combines inductive and deductive thematic analysis, can\nprovide greater methodological rigor (Proudfoot, 2023). We followed this approach by first\nadopting a set of deductive codes based on the core principles of CDP as our guiding\nframework, while also working with the data to inductively make sense of the manuscripts,\nsearching for common sets of meaning, and engaging in logical inference. This represents both\na 'top-down' and \u2018bottom-up' approach to data analysis (Xu & Zammit, 2020). In line with\ncurrent ideas regarding TA, we aimed to avoid generating mere \u2018topic summaries' and instead\ntried to creatively, organically, code the data to move beyond a superficial approach (Braun &\nClarke, 2023).\nTo balance the deductive and inductive elements of the analysis, we used a systematic three-\nphase approach. This began with two researchers jointly developing a deductive framework\nusing CDP principles to develop an initial high-level coding structure. This served as the\nanalyytical foundation for this study. We then conducted separate data familiarization and close\nreading of the manuscripts.\nWe opted to use GenAI tools to support code and theme triangulation. Previous research has\nshown that while GenAI tools may not be capable of reasoning in the manner of human coders,\nas statistical pattern-matching software, they can produce sophisticated analysis of data that\nmay closely match the results of human researchers (Perkins & Roe, 2024a, 2024b), thus are\nsuitable for supporting with triangulation of results. To achieve this, one researcher followed a\ntraditional approach of taking memos during close reading of the source material, manually\ntaking notes, and developing sub-codes for the high-level deductive codes. During this process,\nthey also identified further inductive codes which described the 'qualitative richness of the\nphenomenon' (Boyatzis, 1998, p1) when encountering meaningful segments that did not align\nwith our existing analytical framework. The second researcher used the frontier GenAI model\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, produced by Anthropic, to analyze the source material and identify\ndeductive and inductive codes and sub-codes, based on the agreed high-level coding structure.\nIn the third phase, we engaged in systematic comparison and discussion of the two sets of\ncoding frameworks to identify any potential missing codes and sub-codes. Once an agreed set\nof codes and sub-codes was developed, a further step of theme development was carried out by\nboth researchers (one supported by the GenAI tool). A final discussion and comparison of the\nthemes helped resolve the differences between our findings and iteratively and reflexively\nrefine our overall themes."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Our scoping review revealed both a complex and limited body of research regarding the role\nof GenAI in the agency of both learners and teachers. In all, despite a small number of eligible\nstudies to review, we were able to develop several themes that raise critical questions about the\nfuture of learning in GenAI-enhanced environments from a CDP perspective. Our analysis\nresulted in the output of three themes that helped us interpret the data from the review: Control\nin Digital Spaces, Variable Engagement and Access, and Changing Notions of Agency. A summary of these themes and their descriptions is shown in Table 4."}, {"title": "Control in Digital Spaces", "content": "This theme is related to the undertaking of action in digital spaces and the way in which learners\nmake agentic decisions on how to use GenAI. We noted that within the literature, there was a\nstrong focus on how specific learning actions, such as submitting work, drafting, or reviewing,\nmay be engaged by learners and why. As an example, Yan et al.'s (2024) framework sought to\nunderstand how students exert control when using GenAI tools and noted that learners exhibit\ndifferent behaviors, including whether to reject the use of such tools or integrate them with\nvarying methods and techniques. Those who used the tools most effectively sat on the\n'reflective' end of the spectrum and were able to demonstrate critical skills such as\nintrospection, reflection, and evaluation. Such an approach aligns with Bearman et al.'s (2024)\nnotion of evaluative judgement as an essential tool for the future.\nParker et al. (2024) equally discusses the importance of selective use of GenAI outputs,\nmeaning that learners exhibit both agency and CDL skills in using GenAI. This reflects the\nfocus of CDP, in which learners are co-creators of knowledge rather than passive consumers.\nOn the other hand, we noted little discussion of the potential constraints that GenAI tools may\nplace on learners' agency. It can be asked whether the limitations of GenAI tools, for example\ntheir culture-bound knowledge (Roe, 2024) or potential for manipulation (Ferrara, 2024),\ncreate conditions that constrain the agency of the learner and limit their choices for engaging\nin academic tasks."}, {"title": "Variable Engagement and Access", "content": "The potential for GenAI to exacerbate educational inequalities is a concern that emerged during\nour review and has been noted in the literature. This aligns with broader thinking on the\nrelationship between AI and education, which postulates that unequal access may worsen\ndigital poverty and drive a divide between those with and those without (Miao & Holmes,\n2023). In our review, we found data to support the awareness that limited access to GenAI tools\nmay constrain learner agency, but also that resistance to the use of GenAI is possible. Shum\n(2024), for example, warns that the disadvantages faced by those unable or unwilling to use AI\ntools highlight the risk of creating new forms of digital divide, while Fr\u00f8sig and Romero (2024)\nalso highlight that in the domain of teacher agency, it is important to recognize that GenAI may\nwiden the digital divide among those students who can and cannot afford access to AI tools.\nFurther evidence underpinning this theme comes from Yan et al. (2024), who envision a world\nin which affluent learners may experience more dynamic, personalized learning content than\nless affluent learners, while on the other hand, Godwin-Jones (2022) argues the opposite,\nframing AI tools as a way to reduce social and linguistic inequalities, for example, those with\na lower level of English proficiency. Therefore, the extent to which GenAI may impact agency\nby enhancing or exacerbating educational inequalities is a topic of clear interest in the literature,\nand led us to the development of this theme. From a CDP perspective, this theme strongly\nrelates to questions of equality, power, and the potential social effects of GenAI on learner\nagency."}, {"title": "Changing Notions of Agency and Human-AI Hybrids", "content": "The third theme we developed within our scoping review is based on the concept of agency in\nGenAI-enhanced learning environments undergoing a shift. This means that agency is seen as\nchanging to encompass nonhuman GenAI technologies. The idea that agency is \u2018shared' (Yang\net al., 2020) is not new, and agency is related to the external environment too (Rappa & Tang,\n2017). Yet, agency in a period of GenAI may now be shared between humans and non-human\ntechnologies, as proposed by Godwin-Jones (2022). Similarly, as Dattahrani and De (2023)\ncontend, agency must now be shared between Al actors and humans, and Al tools such as\nChatGPT may be able to exhibit agency (or at least appear to) (Boulus-R\u00f8dje et al., 2024).\nFrom a CDP perspective, this provokes questions as to whether individuals should resist the\nforfeiture of agency to machinery.\nWith this in mind, more work is needed to describe exactly what level of agency we may ascribe\nto GenAI tools, and whether they have some semblance of agentic behavior or are merely an\n'able slave' (Dwivedi et al., 2023). From a CDP perspective, reconceptualizing notions of\nagency and to whom it belongs is part of a broader examination of the power relationships\ninherent in learning environments, particularly those which are digitally enhanced. This aligns\nwith Cox's (2024) analysis of evolving epistemic agency in AI-enhanced education, where he\nargues that traditional notions of learners as 'makers' of knowledge are being challenged by\nnew conceptualizations of learners as 'managers' of information or even as 'information\norganisms' (inforgs) embedded within AI systems. If GenAI tools are being used not just as\ntools, but as more active participants in the learning process and knowledge construction, then\nwe see a greater opportunity for the types of 'entanglement' between human and non-human\nactors as described by Kumar (2024). This suggests that new frameworks must be developed\nto understand exactly how agency operates in hybrid human-AI collaborative learning\nenvironments. These must account for both the algorithmic decision-making principles of\nGenAI tools, as well as the intentional actions of human educators and learners."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our scoping review of the literature on GenAI and learner agency in education, viewed through\nthe lens of Critical Digital Pedagogy (CDP) resulted in the development of three themes that\ncarry implications for future research in this area.\nThe focus on learner control and the potential to empower or diminish learner agency has also\nrecurred throughout the literature. For example, Resnick (2024) stated that AI tutors may\ndisempower or intrude on the learning process. From a CDP perspective, this warrants\nadditional attention \u2013 the product-focused nature of many AI-driven EdTech tools, and the\ndrive for profit means that any benefits to learning are likely to be emphasized, while this\npossibility of disempowerment is likely to be downplayed on the commercial stage. For this\nreason, it is vital to conduct impartial, independent studies on whether such tools have an\nempowering, disempowering, or mixed effect on learner agency.\nA further finding that emerged from our review is the way in which GenAI may contribute to\nreshaping knowledge ownership and construction in educational environments. In Han et al. 's\n(2024) study, for example, the authors observed that among 8-12-year-old students, when\nengaging with GenAI in a storytelling task, many simply copied and pasted outputs directly\nfrom the GenAI tool without making any amendments. In relation to agency and the intellectual\nengagement and autonomy that CDP advocates strive for, this is a concerning issue. However,\nwhy learners do this and whether this represents a diminishment of agency requires further\nresearch. Our review also highlighted that existing studies acknowledged and discussed the\npotential for GenAI to exacerbate existing societal and educational inequalities. Shum (2024)\nfor example, warned that professionals unable or unwilling to use AI tools might find it\nimpossible to meet the productivity of those who embrace AI tools, thus creating an inequitable\nenvironment for those with aptitude and access and those without. On the other hand, some\nstudies noted GenAI's potential for increased personalization, which could align with CDP's\nemphasis on learner-centered education if implemented critically. The need for ethical\nframeworks and responsible AI use in education was also a recurring pattern in the data. Parker\net al. (2024) stressed the need for developing frameworks for responsible AI use in learning\nenvironments, while Yan et al. (2024) highlighted the importance of transparency in AI use,\naligning with CDP's emphasis on demystifying digital tools and processes.\nOur analysis revealed at times a critique of techno-deterministic views of GenAI in education,\nresonating with CDP's skepticism towards technological solutionism. Kumar (2024)\nchallenged the notion of GenAI inevitably transforming education, emphasizing that human\nlives are inevitably entangled in multiple non-human learning-related tools. This perspective\naligns with CDP's view of technology as entangled with social and cultural contexts. These\nfindings demonstrate a developing picture of GenAI for learner agency in education. Viewed\nthrough the critical lens of CDP, there is clearly an urgent need for critical engagement with\nthese technologies, the development of refined digital literacies, and careful consideration of\nethical implications. Simultaneously, the unclear balance between the potential benefits and\nrisks of GenAI presents significant challenges for researchers, educators, and policymakers."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "While this scoping review provides insights into the intersection of GenAI and learner and\nteacher agency in education, there are several limitations that affect the interpretation and\nreplicability of our findings. The field of GenAI in education is rapidly evolving, with all the\nincluded studies published in 2024, suggesting that this topic is only just beginning to be\nexplored. Consequently, long-term impacts and trends are not yet observable. Furthermore, the\ncapabilities of GenAI tools are advancing at such a speed that any potential impact on agency\nwill likely shift as new capabilities and forms of GenAI become available. The use of GenAI\ntools (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) in our analysis process, while aimed at enhancing the identification\nof sub-codes and support in the creation of themes, may have introduced unforeseen biases or\nlimitations in the interpretation of data. The capabilities and limitations of the AI model used\nshould be considered when interpreting our results.\nA significant limitation is also the dominance of theoretical studies in the identified data. While\nthese provide interesting insights, discussions, and considerations of how agency might shift\nin relation to GenAI, the lack of practical applications and empirical studies makes it difficult\nto measure the success of theoretical models against real-world applications. Finally, our\nreview included a small number of studies, which constrains how broad and deep our analysis\ncould be. That said, in identifying the key issues currently underpinning this topic, the review\ncaptures a snapshot of the current concerns regarding GenAI and agency in education. Given\nthe recent emergence of GenAI technologies in education, our review lacks a longitudinal\nperspective of the evolution of the relationship between GenAI and learner agency over time.\nWhile Critical Digital Pedagogy provides a valuable theoretical lens, operationalizing its\nprinciples in the context of GenAI and learner agency presents challenges. The interpretation\nand application of CDP concepts may vary among researchers. As with any review, there is\nalso a risk of publication bias, as studies with positive or significant findings are more likely to\nbe published and included in our review. Given the theoretical nature of the majority of the\npapers identified, this is unlikely to be a significant limitation."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This scoping review reveals that, at present, studies on learner agency and GenAI focus on\nissues of control, access, engagement, and exploring a shifting notion of agency.

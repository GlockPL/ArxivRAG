By leveraging LLMs for synthetic\ndata creation, we aim to address the limitations of traditional survey methods, such as high costs,\ninefficiency and scalability challenges. A novel approach incorporating \"Personas\" - combinations\nof demographic and behavioural attributes - is introduced and compared to five other synthetic\nsurvey methods, which vary in their use of real-world data and methodological complexity. The\nMiD 2017 dataset, a comprehensive mobility survey in Germany, serves as a benchmark to assess\nthe alignment of synthetic data with real-world patterns. The results demonstrate that LLMs can\neffectively capture complex dependencies between demographic attributes and preferences while\noffering flexibility to explore hypothetical scenarios. This approach presents valuable opportuni-\nties for transportation planning and social science research, enabling scalable, cost-efficient and\nprivacy-preserving data generation.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Traditional survey methods face significant challenges, including high costs, inefficiencies and\nscalability limitations.

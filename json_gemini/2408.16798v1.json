Introduction", "content": "Designing a ship is one of the most complex and time-consuming process. From laying down the keel to commissioning, the designing and building of a destroyer approximately takes 7-8 years in India [19]. The most important step in designing a ship is determining the shape of the hull form [3]. Also, the shape of the hull has a direct impact of 70% on the cost of the ship [1]. The conventional approach for designing the hull of a ship involves several key steps like, defining requirements which involves understanding the purpose and operational requirements of the ship, including speed, capacity, range, and environmental conditions. After which the designer develops rough sketches and basic layouts of the hull shape based on requirements and initial feasibility assessments [2].\nThen an initial hull form is generated based on the established guidelines and empirical formulas. Hydrodynamic analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance the of the hull design, which also involves assessing parameters such as resistance, seakeeping behavior and stability. Then this hull form is iteratively refined based on the insights gained from this analysis. The conventional form of optimization approach relies on human expertise, naval architecture principles and engineering analysis to modify and optimize the design [1]."}, {"title": "2. Overview", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (Al) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It encompasses various approaches and techniques aimed at enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem- solving, learning, perception, understanding natural language, and more [14].\nGenerative Al is a specific subfield of artificial intelligence focused on creating or generating new content, often in the form of images, text, music, or other types of media. Instead of simply analyzing and processing existing data, generative Al systems are designed to generate novel outputs based on patterns learned from large datasets.\nOne of the key techniques used in generative Al is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where two neural networks, known as the generator and the discriminator, are trained simultaneously. The generator generates synthetic data while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of that data. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic outputs.\nGenerative Al has applications across various domains, including:\n\u2022 Creative Content Generation:\nGenerative Al can create artwork, music compositions, or even generate new designs for products.\n\u2022 Data Augmentation: It can be used to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models, thereby expanding the available dataset, and improving model performance."}, {"title": "3. Steps in creating Gen Al", "content": "After clearly defining the objectives and scope of the generative Al, the following steps are followed to create a Gen Al [13]:\n\u2022 Data Collection: To train the generative model, relevant datasets are gathered. These datasets should be sufficiently diverse and large to capture the variability in the data.\n\u2022 Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove duplicate entries, handle missing values, standardize format, and ensure consistency.\n\u2022 Choosing a Generative Model Architecture: The architecture defines the structure of the model. This means that it impacts the way the Al model analyses the training data and how it uses this data to create new content.\n\u2022 Model Training: The selected generative model is trained using pre-processed data. This also involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The loss function measures the difference between the generated outputs and the realistic data.\n\u2022 Model Optimization: This is also known as Hyperparameter Tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is like adjusting the settings of a Machine Learning model to make it work better. These settings are called hyperparameters which are like dials controlling how the model learns from the dataset. By fine- tuning hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size etc., the model's performance can be optimized and the rate at which it learns from the dataset.\n\u2022 Evaluation: Evaluate and validate the generated output by comparing it with realistic data and domain knowledge."}, {"title": "4. Dataset", "content": "For understanding and generating a novel hull form design using generative Al, the dataset used for training the generative model was taken from the work published by Noah J. Bagazinski and Faez Ahmed, in their paper \"SHIP-D: Ship Hull Dataset for Design Optimization Using Machine Learning.\u201d [1] Thirty thousand hull forms with design and functional performance data, including mesh, parameterization, and point-cloud, make up the content of the dataset [1]. Each hull form is defined by 45 parameters. This dataset was chosen as it consists of design representation which is comprehensive enough to cover all the features of traditional hull forms. Previously, dimensionality analysis performed on different parent hull forms, undertaken by Wang et al. and Kahn et al, gave the results that 32 and 27 parameters can construct a reasonably complex surface feature of hulls. For getting a diverse spread of hull forms, the dataset chosen consist of hull forms defined by 45 parameters.\nThe 45 parameters are as defined below:\n\u2022 Principal dimensions of the hull are defined by seven terms which are length, beam, depth, draft, and tapers at the ends of the hull.\n\u2022 The cross section of the hull in the parallel midbody is defined by four terms. These parameters can produce cross sections of the flare, tumblehome, bilges, chines, and S-chines that are visible on classic hulls.\n\u2022 The tapered regions at the bow and stern of the hull are defined by a total of twenty terms. These parametric terms define features such as drift angle, keel rise, transom cross section, rake, and the transition from the taper to the parallel middle body.\n\u2022 The bow and stern bulb geometries are defined by fourteen terms, including terms that define the size, vertical asymmetry, and the fillet transition of the bulb into the hull.\nThe hull forms defined by the parameters in the dataset were randomly generated and consists of three distinct subsets of hulls [1]. If the randomly generated parameters resulted in a feasible hull shape, then only it was included in the dataset. This way of generating hull forms was repeated until each subset comprised ten thousand hulls, making a total of thirty thousand hulls in the dataset."}, {"title": "5. Clustering", "content": "K-means clustering is a popular method for clustering unlabeled datasets. K-means is an iterative algorithm that divides a dataset into K number of distinct and non- overlapping clusters. First, it is necessary to specify the number of clusters that will be created [16].\nThe elbow method and silhouette method are two commonly used techniques for determining the optimal number of clusters in an unlabeled dataset. The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters and identifying the \"elbow\" point where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly. This point can be taken as the optimal number of clusters that are present in the dataset, as adding more clusters beyond this point will not significantly reduce the WCSS distance.\nThe silhouette method measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster when compared to other clusters. It computes the silhouette coefficient for each data point and averages it across all data points for different numbers of clusters. A higher silhouette score suggests better-defined clusters. By comparing silhouette scores across different numbers of clusters, the optimal number of clusters can be identified where the silhouette score is highest. Both methods provide valuable insights into the appropriate number of clusters, allowing for more informed decision-making in clustering analysis.\nThen, randomly initialize K cluster centroids (points representing the center of each cluster) in the feature space. Each data point is then assigned to the nearest centroid based on some distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. This step creates clusters where data points are closest to the centroid of their respective cluster.\nAfter all data points have been assigned to clusters, the centroids are updated by calculating the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster. The centroids are recalculated based on the current assignment of data points. The above steps are repeated iteratively until convergence is reached. It can be said that convergence occurs when the centroids are no longer changing significantly between iterations or else when a specified number of iterations is reached. The result is a set of K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster whose centroid it is closest to.\nK-means is computationally efficient and works well with large datasets, making it widely used in various applications such as customer segmentation, image compression, and document clustering. However, it requires the number of clusters, K, to be specified beforehand, and it assumes clusters are spherical and of similar size, which may not always be the case in real-world data.\nA python code was written to apply K- means algorithm to the dataset. The result of which indicated 06 optimal number of clusters in the dataset.", "t-sne": "It is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for visualizing high- dimensional data, particularly in scenarios where datasets are represented by a large number of parameters [17]. Unlike traditional techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE preserves local similarities in the data, making it well- suited for capturing complex structures and patterns in high-dimensional datasets. \nBy transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving local relationships, t-SNE enables the visualization of large datasets in two or three dimensions, making it easier to interpret and analyze. \nThis makes t-SNE particularly useful for exploring and understanding complex datasets with a large number of parameters, such as those encountered in fields like genomics, image processing, and natural language processing. However, it is important to note that t-SNE is computationally intensive and may not always preserve global structures, SO interpretation should be done cautiously, especially with large datasets [17]. \nt-SNE algorithm was applied on the dataset using a python code, and a plot was generated by reducing the 45 parameters which defines each hull form, to a dimension of two features only."}, {"title": "6. Model Architecture", "content": "A generative model is designed to understand the hidden and associated patterns in the dataset and reproduce the features or characteristics of the data. An example of this would be training the generative model with pictures of cats. The model's task is not just to identify that whether the image projected is that of a cat or not, but rather to learn the features that makes up that image of cat. Example of features in this case would be their shape, colours, patterns and textures. After understanding the features, it is able to generate new images of cats that looks realistic but is not a replica of any images that the generative model has been trained on from the training dataset.\nGenerative architecture stands as a pioneering force within contemporary design, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the process of design conception and implementation. Within its arsenal of methodologies lie diverse tools such as Cellular Automata, which adeptly generate intricate designs through fundamental rules, and Shape Grammar, a framework governed by stringent principles to delineate architectural forms [4]. Additionally, Genetic Algorithms draw inspiration from natural processes to ascertain optimal solutions for intricate design challenges, while Artificial Neural Networks emulate cognitive functions, seamlessly navigating through vast datasets [5]. Furthermore, methodologies like Finite Element Analysis and Topology Optimization contribute to the enhancement of structural integrity and efficiency. Collectively, these tools facilitate the exploration of conceptual realms, automate routine tasks, and amplify creative endeavors within the realm of architecture [6]. The generative model architecture employed in this study is the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)."}, {"title": "7. Generating Novel Hull Design", "content": "A novel design with regards to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) typically refers to the creation of new data points that closely resemble the distribution of the original dataset but are not exact replicas of any existing data points.\nGenerating novel designs involves sampling from the learned GMM to produce new data points that exhibit similar characteristics to the original dataset but introduce variations or combinations not explicitly present in the training data. A python code was written so that the GMM is trained on this pre-processed dataset, learning the underlying patterns and structures inherent in the data. Post-training, the model can generate new designs by sampling from the learned probability distribution, resulting in creations that exhibit similarities to the training data but feature novel combinations and variations. To ensure that the model generated is novel, another code was written to check its uniqueness by comparing it with the hull forms on which the generative model was trained.\nAnother important aspect to new generated hull form is to check whether it is a feasible design or not. To meet the requirements of a \"feasible\" hull shape, the surface of the hull must adhere to two conditions:\n\u2022 The hull must be watertight, ensuring there are no openings or gaps in its surface.\n\u2022 The hull surface must avoid self- intersection, meaning it does not intersect with itself.\nAs the hull surface is described by equations incorporating constants influenced by parameter values, assessing whether a hull surface meets the primary feasibility criteria can be achieved through algebraic solutions. The benefit of solving these conditions algebraically lies in the substantial reduction of computational resources required compared to feasibility checks involving mesh generation [1]. Since the dataset already consists of hull forms on which this feasibility check is already done, there is no need to check the feasibility criteria on the new generated hull form."}, {"title": "8. Resistance Calculation", "content": "The new generated novel hull form can be optimized to get a better design. For this project only resistance of the hull form was optimized and other form of optimizations can also be incorporated in future works. To calculate the resistance of the hull form, Michell Integral was chosen as the linear wave solver.\nThe Michell Integral, functioning as a linear wave solver, has become an invaluable asset in calculating hull form resistance, especially when compared to conventional methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis. Its adoption is primarily fueled by several notable advantages [9]. Firstly, the Michell Integral approach provides a streamlined mathematical framework for wave resistance analysis, offering computational efficiency in contrast to the intricate numerical simulations of CFD and FEM. This simplicity translates into reduced demands on computational resources and time, facilitating quicker analyses. Moreover, the method's alignment with linear wave theory, which assumes small-amplitude waves and linearized flow conditions, renders it particularly suitable for practical scenarios, notably in the initial design phases where swift assessments of hull performance are crucial [11].\nAdditionally, its computational efficiency enables seamless parametric studies, enabling rapid evaluation of various design parameters' impacts on wave resistance and efficient hull form optimization. Furthermore, the Michell Integral method's analytical nature fosters transparency in comprehending the underlying physical principles of wave resistance calculations, enhancing result interpretation, and offering insights into hull form hydrodynamics. Despite the high-fidelity results that CFD and FEM analyses may offer for complex flow phenomena, the Michell Integral method remains highly reliable for numerous practical cases, particularly when dealing with conventional hull forms and moderate wave conditions.\nThe Michell Integral is a method used to analyze the wave resistance of a ship's hull. It was developed by John Henry Michell, an Australian mathematician, in the late 19th century [11]. The principle behind the Michell Integral is rooted in potential flow theory, which models fluid flow around an object without considering viscosity.\nThe Michell Integral works by making several fundamental assumptions about the fluid flow around a ship's hull and then integrating the pressure distribution along the wetted surface of the hull to determine wave resistance. Initially, it assumes that the fluid flow can be approximated by potential flow theory, where the fluid is considered inviscid (no viscosity) and irrotational (no vortices). As a ship moves through water, it generates waves at its bow and stern due to pressure differences between the forward and aft ends, resulting in wave resistance opposing the ship's motion. The Michell Integral integrates the pressure distribution along the wetted surface, representing the portion of the hull in contact with water, to calculate wave-making resistance [10]. This mathematical formulation provides with a tool to estimate wave resistance during the ship design process."}, "For calculating resistance of the hull form using Michell Integral [18], a python code was written taking reference from the codes given by Noah J. Bagazinski and Faez Ahmed [1] in their technical paper. \nFor calculating the resistance, the value chosen for speed was 10 knots and the draft was given as 5 meters. The total resistance of the hull form was calculated as the sum of wave drag and skin friction drag: $R_t = R_w + R_f$\nThe wave drag ($R_w$) was calculated using the Michell Integral. The formula used is: $C_w=\\frac{R_w}{\\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^2LOA^2}$\nThe skin friction drag ($R_f$) was calculated using the formula given by ITTC [12]: $C_f = \\frac{0.075}{(Log_{10}(Re) -2)^2}$\nThe desired value for resistance was changed in the code to modify the hull form accordingly. To achieve this, the code was run in a loop till the desired value of resistance was gained.\nThe main aim of the Michell Integral code is to predict the wave drag from a ship progressing at a steady speed, neglecting the effects of viscosity. The first step is to generate the point grid and the inputs which are given for predicting the wave drag coefficient [18].\nPoint grid is generated for accurately representing the geometry of the hull form in the computational model. The Z and X vectors are used for defining the spatial coordinates of the grid points used in solver. The X vector represents the longitudinal positions along the hull, ranging from 0 (start) to the length overall (LOA) of the.", {"title": "9.

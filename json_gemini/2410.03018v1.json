GenAl technologies, including advanced natural language processing (Zhai et al., 2020), content creation tools\n(Lee & Zhai, 2024b), and interactive learning assistants (Latif et al., 2024; Pahi et al., 2024), offer the potential to per-\nsonalize education, enhance student engagement, and revolutionize the production of educational materials. These\nadvancements promise to disrupt traditional pedagogical practices, fundamentally altering the dynamics of classroom\ninstruction and the relationships between teachers and students and technologies (Pahi et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024).\nThat is, as GenAl becomes more sophisticated and widespread, it is increasingly capable of performing tasks that were\nonce the sole domain of teachers, such as generating customized learning content (Nyaaba, Shi, et al., 2024) and pro-\nviding nuanced feedback (Zhai, 2023). This shift necessitates a re-examination of the roles teachers play within the\nclassroom and their agencies- the capacity and autonomy of teachers to make decisions, take initiative, and act in\nways that shape their teaching practices and professional development, as they are now required to adapt to an en-\nvironment where GenAl is not merely an auxiliary tool but an active collaborator in the instructional process (Lan &\nChen, 2024). Understanding how teachers perceive, accept, and engage with these emerging technologies is crucial\nfor ensuring that GenAl is integrated in a way that enhances, rather than diminishes, the educational experience (Collie\n& Martin, 2024).\nDespite the rapidly growing presence of GenAl in education, the literature remains limited in its exploration of the\nnuanced roles that teachers assume as they interact with these systems. Existing research has primarily concentrated\non the technical efficacy of GenAl tools and their perceived impacts on educational outcomes, often neglecting the\nhuman element-specifically, how teachers adapt to and collaborate with these technologies and how GenAl alters\nteachers' agencies in classrooms (Kizilcec et al., 2024). Studies that do focus on teachers tend to examine their atti-\ntudes and perceptions towards GenAl adoption in general (Garofalo & Farenga, 2024; Guo et al., 2024) without delv-\ning deeply into the specific challenges and opportunities presented by GenAl. Furthermore, the literature frequently\nassumes a one-size-fits-all approach to technology adoption, failing to account for the varying levels of GenAl inte-\ngration across different educational contexts and how these differences might influence teachers' roles and agencies.\nSpecifically, the focus has often been on the capabilities of GenAl tools rather than on the pedagogical implications\nthese tools have for the relational dynamics in the classroom. Consequently, there is a critical need for research to\nexamine the specific ways in which GenAl influences teachers' roles and agencies, going beyond simplistic notions of\ntechnology adoption to explore the deeper, more complex interactions between educators and GenAl systems.\nMoreover, current theoretical frameworks that describe teachers' roles and agencies in relation to educational\ntechnology, such as the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model (Rosenberg & Koehler, 2015),\nmay no longer fully capture the breadth of changes brought about by GenAl. These models often emphasize the en-"}, {"title": "2 | NATURE OF GENERATIVE AI AND TEACHERS' ROLES AND AGENCIES", "content": "The advent of GenAl marks a significant evolution in the capabilities of Al systems, characterized by their ability to\nautonomously produce content that was traditionally generated by humans. Unlike conventional technological sys-\ntems, which are primarily designed to perform specific tasks based on predefined rules and datasets, GenAl leverages\nadvanced machine learning models, such as deep neural networks, to create new content, ranging from text and\nimages to audio and video (Jo, 2023). This capacity for content generation introduces a paradigm shift in the educa-\ntional landscape, where the role of teachers is increasingly influenced by the interplay between human creativity and\nmachine-generated outputs (Nyaaba & Zhai, 2024). Understanding the nature of GenAl is critical for comprehending\nits potential impact on teachers' roles and agencies, as it extends beyond mere automation to the co-creation and\naugmentation of educational materials and experiences (Pahi et al., 2024).\nGenAl systems are distinguished by their ability to learn from vast datasets and generate new outputs that are not\nsimply reproductions of existing data but rather novel creations that can adapt to different contexts and requirements.\nFor example, in education, GenAl can produce customized learning materials tailored to individual student needs, such\nas personalized textbooks, assessments, and interactive simulations (Bewersdorff et al., 2024; van den Berg & du\nPlessis, 2023). This capability challenges traditional teaching practices by shifting some aspects of content creation\nfrom the teacher to the GenAl systems. As a result, teachers' roles in content delivery and curriculum design are"}, {"title": "3 | TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS, ACCEPTANCE, KNOWLEDGE, AND PRACTICES\nOF GENERATIVE \u0391\u0399", "content": "As GenAl continues to gain traction in educational settings, understanding teachers' perceptions, acceptance, knowl-\nedge, and practices regarding this technology becomes increasingly crucial. GenAl is unlikely to replace teachers;\ninstead, it plays a crucial role as an instructional companion to assist teachers in all aspects of instruction. Teachers'\nperceptions of GenAl thus directly impact their acceptance, which, together with their knowledge of GenAl, further\ninfluences how effectively GenAl is integrated into the classroom and shapes the broader impact it has on teaching\nand learning. This section delves into the existing literature on these aspects, highlighting how teachers' attitudes and\nknowledge affect their engagement with GenAl and, consequently, the educational outcomes of its application."}, {"title": "3.1 | Perceptions of Generative Al", "content": "Teachers' perceptions of GenAl are shaped by a combination of familiarity with the technology, understanding of its\ncapabilities, and beliefs about its potential benefits and risks. Research suggests that teachers who perceive GenAl\nas a tool that can enhance their instructional practices are more likely to embrace its uses in the classroom (Kaplan-\nRakowski et al., 2023). Positive perceptions often stem from recognizing GenAl's ability to personalize learning, reduce\nadministrative burdens, and provide innovative teaching materials. Specifically, Collie and Martin (2024) found that\nteachers' perceived autonomy-supportive leadership, professional growth striving, and change-related stress of GenAl\nare significantly associated with their eventual engagement and use of GenAl. However, there are also significant\nconcerns. Teachers may perceive GenAl as a threat to their professional roles, fearing that the technology could\nreplace certain teaching functions or diminish the need for teachers. Additionally, there is apprehension about the\nethical implications of Al-generated content, such as the potential for bias, pseudo bias, the loss of originality, and\nissues related to data privacy and security (Zhai & Krajcik, 2024). These concerns can lead to resistance or skepticism\ntowards the adoption of GenAl, particularly among educators who are less familiar with the technology or who have\nhad limited exposure to its applications."}, {"title": "3.2 Acceptance of Generative Al", "content": "Acceptance of GenAl in educational contexts is influenced by several factors, including perceived ease of use, per-\nceived usefulness, and the alignment of the technology with teachers' pedagogical goals. The technology acceptance\nmodel (TAM) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) provide valuable frameworks for\nunderstanding these dynamics (Davis et al., 1989; Venkatesh et al., 2016). According to these models, teachers are\nmore likely to accept and use GenAl if they believe it will enhance their teaching effectiveness and if the technology\nis user-friendly. However, the acceptance of GenAl also hinges on the extent to which teachers feel confident in\ntheir ability to control and integrate technology into their pedagogical practices. This confidence is often tied to the\navailability of professional development and training opportunities that equip teachers with the necessary skills to use\nGenAl effectively (Nyaaba & Zhai, 2024). Studies have shown that teachers' sentiment of GenAl lacks homogeneity (D.\nLee et al., 2024). That is, when teachers receive adequate support and training, their acceptance of GenAl increases,\nleading to more meaningful and sustained use of the technology in their classrooms."}, {"title": "3.3 Knowledge of Generative Al", "content": "Teachers' knowledge of GenAl plays a critical role in determining how they perceive, accept, and ultimately utilize the\ntechnology. This knowledge encompasses both technical understanding and pedagogical integration. Teachers need\nto be familiar with the underlying mechanisms of GenAl, including how these systems learn, generate content, and\npotentially introduce bias. A deep understanding of these concepts enables teachers to critically assess the outputs\nproduced by GenAl and to make informed decisions about how to incorporate these outputs into their teaching. On\nthe pedagogical side, knowledge of best practices for integrating GenAl into instructional design is essential. This\nincludes understanding how to use GenAl-generated content to support differentiated instruction, foster student en-\ngagement, and enhance learning outcomes, which sometimes go beyond the traditional TPACK framework (Feldman-\nMaggor et al., 2024). Research indicates that teachers who possess a strong foundational knowledge of GenAl are\nbetter equipped to leverage its capabilities, resulting in more effective and innovative teaching practices (Garofalo &\nFarenga, 2024). Conversely, a lack of knowledge can lead to superficial or inappropriate use of the technology, which\nmay undermine its potential benefits."}, {"title": "3.4 Practices Involving Generative Al", "content": "The ways in which teachers incorporate GenAl into their teaching practices vary widely and are influenced by their\nperceptions, acceptance, and knowledge of the technology. Some educators use GenAl to automate routine tasks,\nsuch as grading or creating instructional materials, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects\nof teaching (Laak & Aru, 2024; Lee, Latif, et al., 2023; G.-G. Lee et al., 2024; Lee & Zhai, 2023). Others integrate\nGenAl-generated content into their lessons, using it to create personalized learning experiences or to stimulate stu-\ndent curiosity and creativity. For example, teachers might use GenAl-generated prompts for writing assignments, or\nthey might employ GenAl-driven materials to help students explore complex scientific concepts (Martin & Graulich,\n2024; Nyaaba, Shi, et al., 2024). However, the effectiveness of these practices is highly dependent on how well\nteachers understand and manage the capabilities of GenAl. Effective practices typically involve a thoughtful balance\nbetween GenAl-generated content and human oversight, ensuring that the technology enhances rather than detracts\nfrom the educational experience. Moreover, best practices in the use of GenAl also involve continuous reflection\nand adaptation, as teachers assess the impact of the technology on student learning and make adjustments to their\ninstructional strategies accordingly.\nAs teachers' perceptions, acceptance, knowledge, and practices regarding GenAl are interrelated factors that play\ncentral roles in teachers' uses of GenAl, they collectively influence the integration of this technology into educational\nsettings. Positive perceptions and high levels of acceptance are often associated with greater knowledge and more\neffective use of GenAl, while negative perceptions and low acceptance can hinder its adoption and impact (Yin et al.,\n2024). As GenAl continues to evolve, ongoing professional development and support will be crucial in helping teachers\nnavigate this complex landscape, enabling them to harness the full potential of the technology to enhance teaching\nand learning. This understanding lays the groundwork for the section to follow, which will introduce a conceptual\nframework that captures the transformative roles of teachers in the era of GenAl."}, {"title": "4 | A FRAMEWORK: TRANSFORMING TEACHERS' ROLES AND AGENCIES\nIN THE ERA OF GENERATIVE AI", "content": "The evolution of teachers' roles and agencies in the context of GenAl can be understood as a dynamic and multifaceted\nprocess, driven by the interplay between the nature of GenAl technologies and teachers' perceptions, acceptance,\nknowledge, and practices. These stages and teachers' roles are deeply rooted in well-established models of technology\nadoption and innovation diffusion, such as the TAM and UTAUT (Davis et al., 1989; Venkatesh et al., 2016). These\nmodels emphasize that the adoption of new technologies follows a continuum, beginning with awareness and moving\ntoward active engagement and leadership. In the context of GenAl, this continuum is particularly pronounced due to\nthe technology's complexity and the profound impact it has on teaching practices. This framework, which identifies\nfour distinct stages-Awareness, Exploration, Integration, and Innovation-each corresponding to a specific role (i.e.,\nGenAl Observer, Adaptor, Integrator, and Innovator), is not arbitrary but rather emerges from a careful analysis of how\nGenAl fundamentally alters the educational landscape and, consequently, the professional identity and practices of\neducators (see Figure 1).\nGenAl differs significantly from previous educational technologies due to its capacity for autonomous content\ncreation, adaptability, and integration into complex pedagogical processes. Unlike earlier forms of Al, GenAl intro-\nduces new possibilities for personalized learning, creative content generation, and real-time interaction with students.\nThese capabilities demand a reconfiguration of traditional teaching roles, as educators must navigate not only the\ntechnical aspects of GenAl but also its implications for pedagogy, ethics, and classroom dynamics. The four stages\nof the proposed framework are identified based on how teachers progressively engage with these novel aspects of\nGenAl, moving from initial exposure to deep integration and innovation. The stages identified in this framework are\ninformed by the observed progression in teachers' interactions with GenAl, as documented in the literature: from\npassive observation and initial experimentation to full integration and ultimately, the pioneering of new pedagogical\nparadigms."}, {"title": "4.1 Awareness Stage: GenAl Observer", "content": "At the Awareness Stage, teachers function primarily as observers of GenAl, beginning to gather information and form\ninitial impressions about the technology's role in education. This stage is characterized by a cautious approach, as\nteachers have yet to actively engage with Al tools in their teaching practices. Research suggests that teachers at this\nstage are often motivated by a need to understand the broader educational trends and potential impacts of GenAl on\nthe classroom or pure curiosity about GenAl tools such as ChatGPT (Kizilcec et al., 2024). They are in the early phases"}, {"title": "4.2 | Exploration Stage: GenAl Adopter", "content": "As teachers progress to the Exploration stage, they begin to engage more actively with GenAl technologies, piloting\ntheir applications in the classroom. This stage marks a transition from passive observation to active exploration, where\nteachers start to integrate GenAl tools into their teaching practices, albeit in a trial-and-error manner. Teachers may\ntest the waters of GenAl integration, seeking to understand its practical benefits and limitations.\nPractice at this stage is characterized by exploration and piloting. Teachers use GenAl-driven tools such as Chat-\nGPT, intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading software, and GenAl-based learning platforms to supplement\ntheir lessons. For example, in their study, Nyaaba, Shi, et al. (2024) surveyed Ghana teachers in using Generative Al\nas a teaching assistant. The teachers had not yet systematically applied GenAl tools in classroom settings, but had\nleveraged GenAl for various instructional activities, such as identifying assessment strategies (see Figure 3). However,\nthese explorations were not yet consistent or fully integrated into the curriculum or accompanied by specific peda-\ngogy. Instead, teachers were in a phase of trial and refinement, testing GenAl applications to see what works best for\ntheir students and teaching style. The literature indicates that this exploratory phase is critical for building teachers'\nconfidence and competence in using GenAl, setting the stage for more sustained and effective integration.\nAs teachers start to recognize the tangible benefits of GenAl in education, they see GenAl not just as a theoretical\nconcept but as a practical tool that can enhance student engagement, personalize learning experiences, and streamline\nadministrative tasks. This evolving perception is often fueled by initial successes in using GenAl tools, which reinforce\nthe idea that GenAl can complement rather than replace their teaching practices.\nAs teachers gain hands-on experience with GenAl tools, their initial skepticism diminishes, replaced by a cautious\noptimism about the technology's potential. This growing acceptance is crucial for sustained GenAl integration, as it\nreflects an increasing confidence in the technology's ability to enhance educational outcomes. Teachers at this stage\nare more open to exploring new Al tools and are willing to invest time in learning how to use them effectively.\nTeachers' knowledge of GenAl also deepens during this stage, moving beyond basic theoretical understanding\nto acquire practical knowledge about GenAl concepts such as machine learning, natural language processing, and\ntheir specific applications in educational tools. This knowledge is often gained through professional development\nprograms, online courses, or collaborative learning with peers. Teachers become more adept at navigating GenAl\ninterfaces, understanding how these systems generate content, and identifying ways to incorporate GenAl-driven\ntools into their lessons."}, {"title": "4.3 Integration Stage: GenAl Collaborator", "content": "In the Integration stage, teachers move beyond exploration to fully incorporate GenAl into their teaching practices.\nThis stage is characterized by seamless integration of Al tools into the educational process, where teachers use GenAl\nconsistently and purposefully to enhance instructional outcomes and student learning experiences. The literature on\neducational technology integration highlights this stage as one where GenAl becomes an indispensable part of the\nteaching practice, with teachers taking GenAl as a collaborator and leveraging GenAl's capabilities to transform their\npedagogical approaches.\nAt the Integration stage, teachers use GenAl tools consistently and purposefully as an integral part of their ped-\nagogy, employing them to personalize learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, and support student as-\nsessment. For example, Lee and Zhai (2024b) reported that an instructor engaged student teachers to incorporate\nChatGPT in lesson planning. The instructor observed that student teachers incorporated ChatGPT in planned learning\nactivities in various ways (see Figure 4). In this example, the GenAl technology is used not just as a supplement but\nas a core component of the educational process. Teachers at this stage have developed routines and strategies for ef-\nfectively incorporating GenAl into their lessons, resulting in enhanced student outcomes and more efficient teaching\npractices.\nAt the Integration stage, teachers' perceptions reflect a mature understanding of the role of GenAl in education.\nTeachers perceive GenAl as a valuable and integral component of modern education, recognizing its potential to trans-\nform both teaching and learning. They understand that GenAl can not only enhance the efficiency and effectiveness\nof instruction but also open up new possibilities for personalized learning, student engagement, and formative assess-\nment. This positive perception is grounded in experience, as teachers have seen firsthand the benefits that GenAl can\nbring to their classrooms.\nTeachers are confident in their ability to use GenAl tools effectively and are committed to continuous learning\nabout GenAl to keep pace with technological advancements. The literature suggests that this high level of acceptance\nis associated with a proactive attitude towards professional development, where teachers seek out opportunities to\ndeepen their GenAl expertise and explore new GenAl applications. This stage also sees teachers becoming advocates\nfor GenAl integration, sharing their experiences and insights with colleagues and contributing to a broader culture of\nGenAl adoption within their schools (Nyaaba, Zhai, et al., 2024).\nTeachers possess intermediate to advanced knowledge of GenAl-a comprehensive understanding of Al's practical\napplications, ethical considerations, and potential challenges. They are capable of critically evaluating Al tools for\nclassroom use, ensuring that these tools align with their pedagogical goals and meet the needs of their students. This\nadvanced knowledge allows teachers to make informed decisions about how to best integrate Al into their teaching,\nbalancing the use of Al-generated content with human oversight and creativity."}, {"title": "4.4 Innovation Stage: GenAl Innovator", "content": "The final stage in the framework, the Innovation stage, is where teachers become pioneers in the use of GenAl,\npushing the boundaries of how the technology can be applied in education. At this stage, teachers are not just users\nof GenAl tools but innovators and thought leaders, actively shaping the future of GenAl in education. Research on\neducational innovation highlights the significance of this stage, where teachers contribute to the development of new\nGenAl-driven educational paradigms and inspire others to explore the transformative potential of GenAl.\nAt the Innovation stage, teachers usually show substantial leadership and creativity, leading initiatives to trans-\nform teaching and learning through GenAl, developing GenAl-based curricula, mentoring other educators, and col-"}, {"title": "5 | IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the changes to teachers' roles and agencies in the era of GenAl\nand considering teachers' perceptions, acceptance, knowledge, and practices of GenAl as interconnected components\nthat must be addressed holistically. Current research often isolates these factors, overlooking how they collectively\ninfluence teachers' ability to effectively integrate GenAl into their classrooms. By examining these dimensions in\nconcert, we provide a more comprehensive understanding of how teachers engage with GenAl, shedding light on the\ncomplexities of adoption and the varying levels of integration as teachers alter their roles and agencies in classroom\nsettings. This nuanced approach allows for more targeted strategies to enhance teachers' GenAl competencies, which\nis crucial for successful educational reform in this digital era.\nFurthermore, the framework underscores the importance of viewing GenAl as more than just a tool for enhancing\nexisting practices. It has the potential to transform educational practices at a fundamental level (Lee & Zhai, 2024b).\nTeachers' evolving roles and agencies in the era of GenAl-from observers and adopters to collaborators and innova-\ntors-require continuous professional development and institutional support. This paper demonstrates that without\na solid foundation of perceptions, knowledge, and acceptance, teachers are less likely to move beyond the superfi-\ncial uses of GenAl. Thus, it is imperative to foster an environment where teachers can experiment, collaborate, and\ninnovate with GenAl to fully realize its pedagogical potential.\nIn addition, this study highlights the necessity of supporting teachers in not only integrating GenAl but also in\nevolving their roles and agencies to deeply embed the technology into their instructional practices. The study stresses\nthat teachers who receive comprehensive training and support are more likely to engage with GenAl meaningfully,\nmoving beyond basic uses to employ it as a tool for personalized learning, adaptive feedback, and co-creative edu-\ncational experiences. This transformation can only occur if educators are equipped with the skills and knowledge\nto critically assess and apply GenAl, ensuring that it enhances the learning environment while addressing challenges\nsuch as bias and ethical concerns (Lee, Mun, et al., 2023).\nIn conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the evolving roles and agencies\nof teachers in the era of GenAl, emphasizing the importance of addressing their perceptions, knowledge, acceptance,\nand practices as interconnected components. By moving beyond a fragmented view of these factors, we offer insights\ninto how educators can fully integrate GenAl into their pedagogical practices, transforming their roles and agencies\nfrom passive users to active innovators. The framework underscores the need for ongoing professional development\nand institutional support to ensure teachers can effectively harness the potential of GenAl, not only to enhance educa-\ntional practices but to fundamentally reshape them. As education continues to be reshaped by emerging technologies,\nthe ability of teachers to engage critically and creatively with GenAl will be crucial in driving meaningful, equitable,\nand impactful learning experiences."}]}

For IoV deployments, we propose a novel fan-shaped trust-based routing model with Quality of Service (QoS) and security-aware side-chaining. Our method employs temporal levels of delay, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption to determine optimal routing paths, thereby ensuring efficient data transmissions. We employ the Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) algorithm to manage side-chains within the network, which dynamically adjusts side-chain configurations to optimize system performance. The technique of fan-shaped clustering is used to group nodes into efficient clusters, allowing for more efficient communication and resource utilization sets. Extensive experimentation and performance analysis are utilized to evaluate the proposed model. Existing blockchain-based security models have been significantly improved by our findings. Our model achieves a remarkable 9.5% reduction in delay, a 10.5% improvement in throughput, a 2.9% improvement in PDR, and a 4.5% reduction in energy consumption compared to alternative approaches. In addition, we evaluate the model's resistance to Sybil, Masquerading, and Flooding attacks, which are prevalent security threats for IoV deployments. Even under these attack scenarios, our model provides consistently higher QoS levels compared to existing solutions, ensuring uninterrupted and reliable data transmissions.

Introduction", "content": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) deployments have proliferated at an exponential rate, allowing for the seamless interconnection of a vast array of devices and systems. This interconnectedness has led to the production of vast quantities of data that must be transmitted across the network in an efficient and secure manner. To ensure the dependable and timely delivery of IoV data, the design of robust and efficient routing models with integrated quality of service (QoS) and security mechanisms has become essential for different cases via use of Privacy-Preserving based Secured Framework for Internet of Vehicles (P2SF [2]) [1, 2, 3].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel fan-shaped clustered trust-based routing model for IoV deployments with QoS and security-aware side-chaining. Our approach intends to address the difficulties associated with achieving efficient and secure routing in large-scale IoV networks, while simultaneously ensuring the desired QoS levels for a variety of application scenarios.\n\nThe incorporation of temporal metrics such as delay, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption as routing decision factors is one of the most significant contributions of our work. By taking into account these temporal levels, our model intelligently selects optimal routing paths based on real-time network conditions, thereby effectively reducing delays, enhancing throughput, accelerating data delivery rates, and optimizing energy consumption. This ensures that the network operates at peak efficiency, meeting the needs of IoV applications that require real-time operations [4, 5, 6].\n\nWe introduce the Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) algorithm for managing side-chains within the network to further improve the performance and adaptability of the proposed model. Side-chains provide a method for offloading specific tasks from the main blockchain, allowing for increased scalability and efficiency. The BFO algorithm adjusts side-chain configurations dynamically based on network conditions, optimizing system performance in real time.\n\nIn addition to temporal optimization and side-chain management, our model employs fan-shaped clustering to organize nodes into effective clusters. Fan-shaped clustering ensures that nodes within a cluster are in close proximity, allowing for direct communication and reducing the need for multi-hop routing. This reduces"}, {"title": "1.1. Motivation of this paper", "content": "This paper aims to design an efficient fan-shaped clustered trust-based routing model with QoS and security-aware side-chaining for IoV deployments in response to these challenges. Our research is motivated by the following significant factors:\n\nDemand for Effective Routing: Due to their inability to accommodate the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of IoV devices, traditional routing protocols may not be suited for IoV networks. In order to optimize routing paths based on QoS parameters, such as delay, throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and energy consumption, it is necessary to develop routing models that are specifically tailored for IoV deployments. By addressing these metrics, our proposed model intends to significantly improve the data transmission efficiency in IoV networks [10, 11, 12].\n\nProtection Considerations: IoV networks are susceptible to a variety of security risks, such as Sybil attacks, Masquerading attacks, and Flooding attacks. Existing blockchain-based security models have demonstrated promise in mitigating these threats; nevertheless, their integration with routing models and impact on QoS parameters have not been exhaustively investigated. Our research intends to close this gap by incorporating secure and trust-based routing mechanisms while maintaining high QoS levels even in attack scenarios."}, {"title": "1.2. Contributions of this paper", "content": "This paper makes significant contributions to the field of IoV network management, particularly in the contexts of routing, quality of service, and security. The major contributions of this study can be summed up as follows:\n\nFan-shaped Clustered Trust-Based Routing Model: We propose a novel routing model that groups nodes into efficient clusters using fan-shaped clustering. This method decreases communication overhead, minimizes multi-hop routing, and maximizes resource utilization. By clustering nodes, our model enables more efficient communication and data transmission in IoV networks.\n\nIncorporation of QoS Metrics: Our model includes temporal levels of delay, throughput, PDR, and energy consumption as determining factors for selecting optimal routing paths. By taking into account these QoS parameters, we ensure that routing decisions are based on real-time network conditions, resulting in increased efficiency and on-time data delivery. The incorporation of QoS metrics enables our model to satisfy the requirements of IoV applications that are time-sensitive.\n\nSecurity-Aware Side-Chaining: To manage side-chains within the network, we use the Bacterial Foraging Optimizer (BFO) algorithm. Side-chains provide a mechanism for offloading particular tasks from the main blockchain, thereby enhancing scalability and efficiency."}, {"title": "2. Literature Review", "content": "Due to their ability to improve the security and dependability of data transmission, trust-based routing models have garnered significant interest in the realm of IoV networks. These models make routing decisions based on the trustworthiness of nodes or paths using trust metrics and mechanisms. Several trust-based routing models have been proposed in the literature, each addressing unique challenges and incorporating distinctive characteristics.\n\nWork in [13, 14, 15] proposed the Secure and Trust-Aware Routing Protocol (STAR) via use of Lattice-Based Secure and Dependable Data Dissemination Scheme (LS D3S) as one such trust-based routing model. The STAR protocol employs trust values that are assigned to nodes based on their past behavior and interactions. It adjusts routing paths dynamically based on trust values, ensuring more reliable and secure data transmission. However, this model does not account for QoS parameters, which are essential for ensuring the timely and effective delivery of IoV datasets & samples.\n\nWork in [16, 17, 18] proposed the Cluster-based Trust-Aware Routing Protocol (CTR), a noteworthy trust-based routing model. CTR integrates trust values and clustering techniques to establish secure and dependable routing paths in IoV networks. The model clusters nodes according to their reliability, and routing decisions are made within these clusters. Critical to achieving efficient data transmission in IoV networks are the temporal aspects of network performance, such as delay, throughput, and energy consumption, which are not explicitly considered by the CTR protocols.\n\nIn recent years, blockchain technology has attracted considerable interest due to its potential to provide secure and decentralized transactional systems. In the context of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, blockchain models offer advantages such as improved data integrity, immutability, and transparency. Several models based on blockchain technology have been proposed to address the security and trust issues in IoV networks.\n\nWork in [19, 20] proposed the TrustChain framework as a notable blockchain model. Combining blockchain technology with reputation systems, TrustChain establishes trust among Internet of Vehicles devices. A distributed ledger is used to record and verify device transactions, ensuring the integrity of data exchanged within the network. However, TrustChain does not explicitly address QoS concerns and does not include routing mechanisms that are dynamic for real-time scenarios.\n\nWork in [21, 22, 23] proposed the Secure and Lightweight Blockchain-based Routing (SLIBR) protocol as an additional significant blockchain model for IoV networks. Using blockchain technology, SLiBR establishes secure routing paths in IoV networks. The protocol records trust information using distributed ledger technology and facilitates secure routing decisions. SLiBR takes trust values into account, but it does not explicitly incorporate QoS parameters or temporal optimization into the routing process via use of improved Multiple Server-based"}, {"title": "3.

Result Analysis & Comparisons", "content": "The proposed Model uses a combination of Fan Shaped Clustering, Trust-based Miner Selection, and BFO for sidechaining operations. In order to identify low complexity routes with efficient & secure sidechaining configurations. These routes have been chosen because they have a low delay, a low energy consumption, a high temporal throughput, and high temporal PDR performance levels. A comparison of the proposed model to the models proposed in P2SF [2], LS D3S [15], and Se MAV [25] is discussed in this section of the text. To validate performance of this model, it was simulated using standard network conditions. The simulation employs a network configuration comprising a variable number of IoV (Internet of Vehicles) nodes, ranging from 1k to 5k, thus simulating large-scale networks. The routing protocol model employed for communication is Adhoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV) process. The communication utilizes omnidirectional antennas. A priority queue with drop-tailing of packets is employed as the type of queue. The network dimensions are set at 2.5 km x 2.5 km for real-time operations. The energy consumption for various communication activities is as follows: 0.4 mJ for transmission, 0.1 mJ for reception, 0.004 mJ for sleep mode, 2 mJ for transitions, and 0.0125 mJ for idle states.\n\nTo evaluate communication speed, average delay was evaluated for N different communications via equation 5, where this communication delay was evaluated for N different communication sets, and tabulated in table 1 as follows,"}, {"title": "5. Conclusions & Future Scope", "content": "This paper concludes with a novel routing model designed specifically for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) deployments. To enhance the efficacy of routing in IoV scenarios, the proposed model integrates several features, including efficient fan-shaped clustering, trust-based routing, quality of service (QoS) considerations, security-aware side-chaining, and distance measurements.\n\nThe evaluation and analysis conducted in this paper demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model in comparison to extant routing models, namely P2SF, LS D3S, and Se MAV, in terms of several important performance metrics. Using the proposed model results in significant improvements in latency, energy consumption, throughput, and packet delivery ratio (PDR).\n\nIn terms of delay, the proposed model obtains a reduction of 12.5% compared to P2SF, 14.5% compared to LS D3S, and 8.5% compared to Se MAV compared to the existing models. This latency reduction is especially advantageous for real-time scenarios and high-speed routing, allowing for quicker and more efficient communication in IoV deployments. It is determined that the incorporation of distance measurements into routing fitness functions is the primary contributor to this enhancement for different scenarios.\n\nThe proposed model outperforms the extant models in terms of energy consumption by achieving energy reductions of 15.5% versus P2SF, 19.5% versus LS D3S, and 18.5% versus Se MAV. This reduced energy consumption is advantageous for long-lasting network routing deployments, particularly in large networks. The decrease in energy consumption can be attributed to the utilisation of residual energy during the modelling of routing fitness functions.\n\nIn addition, the evaluation proves that the proposed model has superior throughput performance. It improves throughput by 15.2% relative to P2SF, 19.4% relative to LS D3S, and 24.5% relative to Se MAV. This increased throughput makes the proposed model an excellent candidate for high-speed routing deployments. Consideration of each route's temporal throughput performance contributes to this significant improvement.\n\nIn addition, the proposed model has a higher packet delivery ratio (PDR) than extant models. It attains a PDR that is 2.3% superior to P2SF, 3.5% superior to LS D3S, and 8.5% superior to Se MAV. This enhancement in PDR is advantageous for high-efficiency routing installations, thereby making the proposed model more practical and dependable than its predecessors. Principally responsible for this improvement is the incorporation of temporal PDR performance throughout the complete route estimation process.\n\nIn addition, the efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated under various attack scenarios, including Sybil, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Finney, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The results indicate that the proposed model maintains its superiority over existing models even when under attack. In comparison to P2SF, LS D3S, and Se MAV, it has decreased latency, energy consumption, throughput, and PDR. The incorporation of side-chains and the use of highly efficient side-chains derived from an analysis of temporal miner performance contribute to the enhanced performance under attack scenarios.\n\nThe paper concludes with a thorough evaluation of the proposed routing model for IoV deployments.

We present a novel methodology that combines multiple neural networks to create an unsupervised and unmoderated stream of unique architectural images. Our approach is grounded in the conceptual framework called machine apophenia. We hypothesize that neural networks, trained on diverse human-generated data, internalize aesthetic preferences and tend to produce coherent designs even from random inputs. The methodology involves an iterative process of image generation, description, and refinement, resulting in captioned architectural postcards automatically shared on several social media platforms. Evaluation and ablation studies show the improvement both in technical and aesthetic metrics of resulting images on each step.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The \"Freaking Architecture\" project represents a novel approach to the application of generative AI in creative fields, particularly architecture. This study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative design, utilizing an ensemble of neural networks to generate an unsupervised and unmoderated stream of unique architectural images.\nThe project employs random keyword combinations to create captioned architectural postcards. Beginning with seed keyphrases derived from 50 selected architectural images, the process expands upon these initial inputs using various AI models, including CLIP [14], BLIP2[7], StableDiffusionV1[15] and SDXL[2].\nThe resulting images, shared across social media platforms, demonstrate the potential of AI in creative visual content generation.\nThe application of neural networks in generative tasks spans various creative domains, including literature[1], typography[8,13,1], visual arts[17,16], and music[9,18]. These AI-driven approaches to content creation raise important questions about the nature of creativity and the potential for machines to produce aesthetically pleasing outputs."}, {"title": "2 Framework", "content": "This study proposes a novel conceptual approach that combines two key ideas: the kaleidoscope effect and machine apophenia. These concepts form the foundation for our methodology of unsupervised and unmoderated generation of high-quality architectural content.\nThe kaleidoscope effect draws inspiration from complex systems theory, particularly the emergence of ordered patterns from simple rules in cellular automata[20]. This concept suggests that intricate and aesthetically pleasing patterns can arise from basic mechanistic recombinations, analogous to the way the I Ching derives complex interpretations from simple coin tosses[19]. In our context, the kaleidoscope effect represents the potential for AI systems to generate diverse and coherent architectural designs through iterative processes applied to random initial inputs.\nIt is known that different training datasets could influence biases of AI models[11,3]. Building on the analogy with a psychological concept of apophenia - the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns in random data - we propose the machine apophenia hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that neural networks, when trained on diverse human-generated data, internalize human aesthetic preferences and cultural norms. Consequently, even when starting from random noise or arbitrary inputs, the network is inclined to adjust its output towards something that aligns with human aesthetic sensibilities, demonstrating some form of \"aesthetic bias.\"\nThe combination of these two concepts - the kaleidoscope effect and machine apophenia provides a foundation for understanding how AI systems can generate aesthetically pleasing and coherent architectural designs from random or minimal inputs. This framework suggests that the iterative application of AI models combined with learned aesthetic preferences can result in outputs that are both novel and aligned with human aesthetic sensibilities."}, {"title": "3 Approach", "content": "Building on our framework, we employ an multi-step process where random inputs are repeatedly processed through various neural networks, resulting in increasingly refined and aesthetically organized outputs. This method bears distant similarities to the refinement process in modern diffusion models, where random noise gradually converges toward meaningful images.\nOur methodology can be broken down into the following steps:\nWe start with a curated dataset of 50 diverse architectural images.\nWe apply the CLIP-interrogation technique[12] to generate initial seed keyphrases from these images, capturing essential features and styles.\nWe then use the GPT-3 model[4] to generate expanded sets of related architectural terms and concepts, ending with 408 keyphrases. This expansion process creates a diverse pool of architectural vocabulary, enriching the subsequent generation steps.\nFirst, we randomly pick several keyphrases from our seed pool and compile the initial query from them.\nThen, we use the Stable Diffusion v1.4 model without any fine-tuning to generate initial 512x512 images based on the generated queries.\nWe utilize the BLIP2 model to generate textual descriptions of the AI-created images. Next, we combine these new descriptions with the initial keyword-based queries to get the refined queries.\nThis step creates a feedback loop, allowing the system to interpret and describe its own creations, potentially introducing new concepts or refining existing ones.\nThe refined queries from the previous step are fed back into SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL) to create refined versions of the architectural images, sized as 1024x1024.\nWe use no quality control or filtering at all, except the safety filter built-in in the SDXL model.\nThe final images are paired with their corresponding textual descriptions to create \"architectural postcards.\""}, {"title": "4 Evaluation", "content": "The study utilizes both technical and aesthetic metrics to evaluate the generated images. To comprehensively assess the quality and relevance of the generated architectural images, we use Image Quality Assessment metrics developed in [6]. Specifically, we apply pre-trained \"aesthetic\" and \"technical\" models, and each returns a score from 1 to 10. The first model aims to address the aesthetic aspects"}, {"title": "5 Observational Study", "content": "To understand the impact of different keyphrases on user engagement, we conducted a factor analysis based on one year of data collected from emoji reactions on our Telegram channel. This analysis aimed to identify which keyphrases significantly influenced user engagement, measured through the conversion rate of emoji feedback. The conversion rate was calculated as the percentage of images that received emoji reactions out of the total number of images containing a specific keyphrase. This metric served as a proxy for user engagement.\nThe results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2. The table categorizes keyphrases into two groups: significantly engaging keyphrases and less engaging keyphrases, based on their conversion rates."}, {"title": "6 Discussion", "content": "The findings of this study highlight the potential of generative AI in the field of architectural design, mainly through the concepts of the kaleidoscope effect and machine apophenia. By leveraging these concepts, we have demonstrated that AI systems can produce aesthetically pleasing and coherent architectural designs from random or minimal inputs. This approach not only broadens the scope of AI applications in creative fields but also raises important questions about the nature of creativity and the role of human input in AI-generated content.\nOne of the key insights from our study is the iterative refinement process, which significantly enhances the quality of the generated images. The multi-step methodology, involving initial seed generation, image generation, query refinement, and image refinement, ensures that the final outputs are both technically sound and aesthetically appealing.\nThe evaluation metrics used in this study, particularly the aesthetic and technical scores, provide a comprehensive assessment of the generated images. The ablation studies further underscore the importance of each component in our system, demonstrating that the combination of various neural networks and iterative refinement leads to superior results. The comparative analysis of different model configurations reveals that our proposed schema consistently outperforms other setups, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.\nThe observational study on user engagement offers valuable insights into the impact of different keyphrases on user interaction. The analysis indicates that keyphrases evoking curiosity, mystery, and artistic value tend to engage users more effectively. This finding can inform future content generation strategies, emphasizing the use of more engaging keyphrases to enhance user interaction and satisfaction.\nHowever, the study also acknowledges the challenges associated with evaluating AI-generated content, particularly in terms of aesthetic qualities. The subjective nature of aesthetics complicates the evaluation process, and while pre-trained models provide a helpful starting point, they may not fully capture the nuances of human aesthetic preferences. Future research could explore more sophisticated evaluation techniques, incorporating user feedback and other qualitative measures to better assess the aesthetic value of AI-generated content."}]}

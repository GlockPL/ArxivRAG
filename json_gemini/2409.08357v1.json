We model the behavior of market agents in a controlled experimental setting, assessing their ability to converge toward competitive equilibria. The results reveal the challenges current LLMs face in replicating the dynamic decision-making processes characteristic of human trading behavior.

This state of equilibrium is critical for understanding how markets function in real-world scenarios [1, 9, 7]. Previous experiments [2, 15, 16, 17] used controlled settings to replicate market conditions, allowing for observing economic principles in action. These experiments provide empirical support for market theories and help refine the predictions of economic models regarding human behavior in markets.\nThis study leverages LLMs's generative ability to model the dynamics of competitive markets. Inspired by the capability of LLMs to simulate complex interactions [3, 8, 4, 5, 6], this work explores whether LLMs can be engineered to embody market agents whose behaviors should converge toward competitive equilibria. We used ChatGPT-4.0 to analyze the dynamics of double auction experiments, offering a novel AI-driven perspective on economic market behaviors. Our findings indicate that while LLMs provide a scalable platform for simulating market dynamics, their limited adaptive learning and real-time feedback hinder their ability to reach market equilibrium, underscoring the need for further improvements to model complex economic behaviors effectively."}, {"title": "Preliminary: Market Equilibrium and Double Auction Mechanisms", "content": ""}, {"title": "Conceptualizing Market Equilibrium through Welfare Maximization", "content": "Market equilibrium represents a state where supply equals demand, and both consumer and producer surpluses are maximized.

That is:\n$s p_e + k = tp_e - h $\n$p_e = \\frac{h-k}{s-t}$"}, {"title": "Experiment Design", "content": "The experimental setup closely follows the configuration of the original experiment series #1 from the foundational market equilibrium study [2]. The experiment consists of five rounds, each representing a single trading day, with 11 buyers and 11 sellers whose identities remain unchanged throughout. Each participant receives a card with a number between 0.75 and 3.25, indicating either the cash they hold (for buyers) or the cost of their item (for sellers). Sellers can only list prices above their cost, while buyers can only bid below their available cash. A transaction occurs when a participant accepts a listed price. Each participant is allowed one transaction per day. At the start of each trading day, the previous day's transaction price is shared as background information, and after each transaction, the updated details are communicated to all participants.\nTo adapt this process for use with LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4.0, we designed a three-step approach in Figure 1to abstract the procedures used in human experiments. This method ensures the experiments are conducted in a formal and reproducible manner.\nInitialization Stage The system sends a prompt to all participants (each representing a separate ChatGPT-4 session) outlining the double auction rules and providing the current round information. Participants must confirm their understanding of the rules. At the start of each new round, only the information about the previous transaction is updated, while the rest of the message remains the same.\nPrice Posting and Matching This stage involves selecting a random session using a number generator to simulate spontaneous price-posting behavior. Three types of prompts are sent, depending on whether a buyer posts a price, a seller posts a price, or both do. If a participant decides to post a price, their response is recorded. A deal occurs when a seller's price is less than or equal to the buyer's price, or vice versa. The deal price is added to the transaction history and shared in subsequent rounds.\nFinal Call If no participants respond to the system prompts to post or update prices, a final call reminder is sent. After three reminders with no updates, the trading day ends. This process is repeated five times, following the original study's methodology."}, {"title": "Result and Discussion", "content": "Figure 2 the predetermined demand and supply curves for the LLMs in our experiments. Based on the procedures outlined in Section 3, we documented transaction prices and trends as depicted in Table 1 and Figure 3. In experiments involving human subjects [2], transaction prices typically display a gradual trend of convergence toward the theoretical equilibrium price of $2.00. This behavior aligns with the Walrasian equilibrium theory [18], which posits that in a market of rational agents who are fully informed and act to maximize utility, prices will adjust to balance supply and demand, effectively clearing the market.\nHowever, in the LLM-driven experiment, this pattern of convergence toward the equilibrium price was not observed. Instead, the transaction prices generated by the LLMs fluctuated around the target equilibrium price of $2.00 throughout the trading periods, without a clear trend toward stabilization. In our experiment, the first trading period had a coefficient of convergence of 4.17, suggesting a moderate deviation from the equilibrium. However, subsequent periods, such as the second, displayed a much higher deviation with a coefficient of 20.00, reflecting substantial fluctuations in pricing decisions made by the LLM. This variability persisted throughout the experiment, with the fifth and final period showing a slight improvement in convergence (a coefficient of 2.67), though still not indicative of a stable trend towards equilibrium. These results underscore the LLMs' inability to adjust and learn from ongoing market conditions as human traders do, leading to more erratic pricing behavior and a lack of consistent movement towards the theoretical equilibrium. Several factors inherent to the nature of LLMs and their operational framework might explain this discrepancy:\nLack of Adaptive Learning: In human trading, adaptive learning can be modeled using a recursive updating of price estimates formula [13, 14]:\n$p_{t+1} = p_t + \\gamma (p^* \u2013 p_t)$\nwhere pt is the current price at time t, p* is the transaction price observed, and \u03b3 is the learning rate indicating how quickly agents incorporate new information. In contrast, LLMs may use a static model: p = f(x), where p is derived directly from inputs x without adjustment over time.\nAlgorithmic Rigidity and Limited Market Feedback Integration: Human traders dynamically adjust their strategies using a model [14, 13]: $p_t = \\alpha S_t + \\beta D_t + \\epsilon$, where St and Dt represent supply and demand at time t, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 adapt over time. They also update their strategies based on ongoing market feedback, modeled by [11, 10]:$\\pi_{t+1}(p) = \\frac{\\pi_t (p).L(p;y_t)}{\\int \\pi_t(p').L(p;y_t)dp'}$, where \u03c0t (p) is the prior belief about price, and L(p; yt) is the likelihood of observing a signal yt. Conversely, LLMs use a static approach with fixed parameters: p = \u03b8Tx, and a simple feedback mechanism: p = g(yt, \u03b8), where \u03b8 remains constant, combining adaptation and feedback into a single, less flexible process. This highlights a fundamental limitation in LLMs' ability to mimic the nuanced and responsive behaviors of human traders.\nAbsence of Psychological Factors: Human decision-making in markets often involves elements such as fear and greed, which can be modeled using the following equation: $U(x) = x^a \\cdot exp(-\\lambda \\cdot d)$, where x represents the monetary outcome, a captures risk aversion, \u03bb is the loss aversion coefficient, and \u03b4 is the deviation from a reference point. LLMs lack such complex emotional frameworks, operating instead within the confines of utility maximization devoid of emotional biases: $U(x) = \\sum w_i x_i$, where wi are weights assigned to different outcomes xi, calculated without behavioral adjustments."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This study has demonstrated significant differences between the behaviors of LLMs and human traders in achieving market equilibrium, extending the foundational experimental economics work of Vernon Smith. LLMs, while consistent and unbiased, lack the dynamic response capabilities that human traders possess. This hinders their ability to achieve Walrasian equilibrium, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated AI models that can dynamically adapt to changing market conditions. While current LLMs are limited in mimicking complex human behaviors in markets, this research highlights a pathway toward improving their effectiveness through continuous technological and methodological advancements."}, {"title": "Future Directions and Implications:", "content": "Incorporating adaptive learning and behavioral economics could enhance the utility of LLMs as economic-related agents or economic research. Such models could also facilitate large-scale sim-ulations to test economic theories and predict market responses to regulatory changes with high precision. This research serves as an initial evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in modeling market behavior. Future work should explore diverse settings, such as varying market conditions, different types of auction mechanisms, and enhanced LLM training protocols, to fully assess the potential and limitations of LLMs in economic simulations."}]}

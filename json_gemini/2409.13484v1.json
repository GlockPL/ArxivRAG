These biases can be detected in a wide\narray of Al models and specific NLP tasks like translations, sentiment analysis, abusive language detection, and more\n[8, 11, 12, 42, 61, 64].\nLLMs often associate professions with specific genders, such as linking \"doctor\" with men and \"nurse\" with women,\nreflecting societal biases [11, 30, 45, 93, 99] while also reinforcing traditional gender roles embedding historical biases\nlike associating men with science and power while women with homemaking and humanities [7, 11, 20, 44, 54, 67, 71].\nMultilingual LLMs reflect subtle gender biases, such as defaulting to gendered pronouns based on stereotypes during\ntranslation [17, 30, 39, 48, 53, 78].\nSuch gender biases and stereotypes can also be observed in various domains like education where educational materi-\nals across different fields have noted the presence of these biases [12, 20, 28, 44, 54, 91]. Studies have established the\nnegative impact of stereotyping on children since it can influence their choice of current hobbies and interests as well\nas future career options [28, 44, 45, 49, 70, 77].\nGender biases in Al systems extend to associating AI entities as predominantly male and white, with content modera-\ntion systems disproportionately flagging comments about women [11, 13, 24, 27, 31, 39, 57]. Kaplan et al. [39] showed\nhow Al-generated recommendation letters reflect implicit gender biases which can potentially reinforcing inequality in\nhiring processes. Additionally, it is argued that while these models reflect the biases present in their training data, their\nscale and speed can amplify the impacts, particularly in areas such as hiring and financial services [6, 45, 48, 93, 94].\nFairness-aware algorithms and debiasing techniques in LLMs, have made some progress but often fail to address\nthe deeper, systemic biases embedded within models [22, 72, 76, 99] hence robust, continuous mitigation efforts are"}, {"title": "2.2 Gender Bias in Language Representation in English, Hindi, and Other Indian Languages", "content": "LLMs are predominantly trained on Western data and thus often fail to capture the cultural nuances of gender in\nIndian contexts[35, 69, 102]. Indian languages are significantly underrepresented in training data compared to Eng-\nlish and the linguistic structures around those languages create unique challenges for LLMs which leads to poorer\nmodel performance and increased gender bias in non-English contexts[35, 38, 102] Assigning gendered pronouns\nbased on stereotypes reinforces traditional gender roles along with the erasure of non-binary identities. This prob-\nlem is exacerbated in low-resource languages, like Hindi where training data is limited which further entrenches these\nbiases [28, 30, 75, 91, 102]\nLLMs exhibiting gender bias in translations between English and gender-neutral languages like Bengali reveal a sig-\nnificant challenge in NLP. For instance, an LLM might translate gender-neutral Bengali occupations to English using\nmale pronouns for traditionally male-associated professions and female pronouns for professions stereotypically as-\nsociated with females. This not only misrepresents the original text but also perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes\n[30, 53, 88].\nUtilization of in-context bias suppression techniques has been discussed, however, these techniques are not fool-\nproof and require careful calibration, especially in multilingual settings where cultural and linguistic nuances play a\nsignificant role [37, 58, 81, 86]\nGender bias in LLMs is a global issue, particularly evident in the United States and India, where these models perpet-\nuate stereotypes and reinforce societal biases [98]. It has been noted that LLMs contribute to discrimination in India,\nparticularly against marginalized women, impacting their education and employment opportunities [13, 41]. In India,\nthe intersection of gender with caste and religion deepens social hierarchies, further entrenching inequalities [59].\nCurrent debiasing methods have proven to be ineffective for Indic languages despite the obvious presence and prop-\nagation of harmful gender biases in LLM-generated content in those languages [34, 41]. Owing to the established\nsignificant negative effects of such biases, it becomes crucial to understand how these biases and cultural differences\noccur and propagate and be cautious of their implications for a heavily biased Indian society. This understanding can\nbe then applied to developing nuanced systems and debiasing methods for these complex non-western languages."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "We adapted a methodology inspired by Kotek et al., who modified the WinoBias dataset to test implicit gender bias\nin English Language generation by LLMs [44].

The following is the link to our datasets (unlinked for anonymity). Some of\nthe Examples from our dataset are in the Table 1.\nWe created datasets with queries that use gender-neutral occupations to keep the gender ambiguous. For example, in\nthe query \"the fighter called the empress because she was lost,\" it's clear that \"she\" refers to the empress. This lack of\nambiguity means we can't use this example because we want our queries to be uncertain about who the pronouns are\nreferring to.\nThis limited the Hindi nouns we could use as Hindi has many gendered occupation titles. For example, we can not use\n'writer' as an occupation because it translates to 'lekhak' (male writer) or 'lekhika' (female writer) in Hindi. There is no\ngender-neutral translation of the word writer in Hindi. Therefore, we consciously chose occupations that were gender-\nneutral in Hindi. Furthermore, some occupation names are directly adopted from English into Hindi.

So What?", "content": "LLMs are increasingly integrated into various societal layers, impacting individuals of diverse ages and backgrounds.\nDespite their benefits, regressive gender biases in LLM responses perpetuate harmful stereotypes, leading to greater\ndiscrimination [5, 13, 45]. In India, deeply ingrained socio-economic disparities and gender biases exacerbate these\nissues [68, 85]. The heavy reliance of Indians on LLMs, often perceived as accurate sources of information [38], under-\nscores the need for careful development tailored to this context.\nMoreover, children using LLMs for education are particularly vulnerable to these biases. Their impressionable minds\nare easily influenced by stereotypes, which can negatively affect their self-esteem and confidence, especially in a soci-\nety that reinforces these biases [49]. Researchers exploring the applications of LLMs in education find that these biases\nmight render LLMs ineffective as educational tools, particularly in India, where the reinforcement of stereotypes could"}, {"title": "6 LIMITATIONS", "content": "undermine their educational value.\nCurrent LLM development efforts aim to bridge language barriers for underserved and regional communities in India\n[1-3]. Women in these communities are particularly at risk from implicit gender biases in region-specific LLMs, po-\ntentially undermining their self-esteem and discouraging their engagement [13, 45, 95].\nComplex gendered languages like Hindi present challenges for applying standard debiasing techniques used in English,\nresulting in inconsistencies and inaccuracies [47, 52]. Additionally, the lack of data for lesser-represented languages\ncomplicates bias evaluation. To address these issues, evaluation metrics must evolve to better accommodate cultural\nnuances and the specific needs of different applications [19, 29]. It is crucial to develop evaluation methods that reflect\ncultural differences and the potential harm that LLMs can cause in various contexts. A culturally sensitive approach\nshould be adopted for evaluating LLM performance in diverse languages, with benchmarks addressing factors such as\ngender roles and socio-economic hierarchies.\nTo mitigate the harms of gender biases, post-hoc debiasing strategies must be informed by thorough research on\ncultural propagation of biases. Enhancing transparency in LLM interactions and informing users about potential risks\nare essential [23, 40]. Human oversight is vital for checking content, especially when it affects vulnerable audiences\n[87]. As LLM capabilities advance, integrating human factors and cultural sensitivity into evaluation and debiasing\nstrategies is crucial for the ethical development of Generative AI."}]}

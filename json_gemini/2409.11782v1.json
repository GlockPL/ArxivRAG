However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO2(110). Indeed, thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected data dictionary is then used to generate an AI - Artificial Intelligence - GRU model for the thin films of tin oxide SnO2(110) structural property characterization.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "X-Ray diffraction, discovered by R\u00f6ntgen in 1895 [1], is a crucial method for understanding and extracting structural properties of crystalline materials, which are usually resumed in lattice parameters a, b, c, grain size D and strains [2]. This diffraction technique plays a pivotal role in characterizing material properties across various fields, from minerals to advanced technological raw materials. The X-Rays diffraction principle consists on the interaction of X-rays with solid materials, resulting in diffraction patterns that provide insights into the periodicity of atomic structures. Unlike this, availability and exponential cost of X-ray diffraction make its use very challenging for researchers and engineers, but mainly because that X-ray diffraction requires significant samples of experimental data due to the high number of parameters. Furthermore, the ab-initio calculation methods are emerging nowadays as a promising alternative for characterizing the atomic structure and properties of materials.\nUnfortunately and instead of the progress of theoretical and simulation methods, the structural characterization still be too limited because of the current available computing capacity of machines, especially when dealing with complex crystalline structures with high number of atoms [3] [4]. Thus, more new explorations have been done to search for soft and less costly"}, {"title": "2 Data-Driven Material Characterization Framework", "content": "In the depicted framework below (see Figure 1), we illustrate the different stages of our data-driven characterization process.

Experiment Stage : At this stage\nsee Figure 1, the engineers and researchers do real physical experiments, define relevant properties that may fit the physical or chemical situation and collect concrete samples to construct a data dictionary that summarises the experimental specifications. These collected data are then used in modeling, simulation, or even to design data-driven models.\n2. Information Stage : This stage - Figure 1 - mainly concerns the data-driven model development. The data dictionary is pre-processed and the data are prepared using normalization, regularization and features reduction to respond to a task or goal oriented request. Finally an AI model is designed and tested to get better of its performances.\n3. Decision Stage : In this stage we integrate the constructed AI driven model in the decision process.

Then, the outgoing beam, who makes a 2\u03b8 with awards one, is obtained as a result of interaction with the atoms of the crystal. Every wavelength \u03bb of the X-ray beam should be proportional to the spacing of the set of crystal planes (hkl), d and the reflection will occur if Bragg's law below is satisfied - See the equation 1, where, n is a positive integer, \u03bb a wavelength and d is gain size.\n\\begin{equation}\n2dsin(\\theta) = \\eta \\lambda, Where\\_x = 1.540A^\\circ\n\\end{equation}\nNext, to compute lattice parameters a and c, we use the equation 2 obtained from lattice spacing formula for a tetragonal crystal system [16], where h,k and 1 are Miller indices defining an (hkl) plane in the lattice :\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{1}{d^2} = \\frac{h^2 + k^2}{a^2} + \\frac{l^2}{C^2}\n\\end{equation}\nBy applying the Bragg law's and considering the constants A = \u03bb\u00b2/ (4a\u00b2) and C = \u03bb\u00b2/ (4c\u00b2), we obtain:\n\\begin{equation}\nsin^2(\\theta) = A(h^2 + k^2) + Cl^2.\n\\end{equation}"}, {"title": "4 GRU-Based Predictor", "content": "As a streamlined version of complex AI models [18][19][20][21][22], the gated recurrent unit (GRU) [23] achieves good performance and do faster computing.

Thus, physical symbols and theirs respective designations are specified and validated by material physics experts. We note that this step is crucial and should be done correctly to get an adequate data-driven models that fit precisely the situation of characterization.\nAfter, the task of data collection has to be considered with care, knowing its sensitivity and determination in the learning process. It is important to notice here that inaccurate data with poor quality should lead to catastrophic decisions. Many AI models are ineffective because of the lack of date and/or the quality of data.\nOnce the data has been specified and then collected, we can analyse statistically their nature, either by visualization or by computing statistical characteristics, such as the mean \u03bc, the standard variation \u03c3, the Median and others. This will enable us to choose the best data preparation technique to use See Table 2. We have noticed that the parameters Tsec(%s) and Time(%s) are constants because theirs standard deviations are null (See Table 1, \u03c3= 0.0\u2020) and there are multiple scaling in the data set (See Table 1, \u03bc(Vdip) = 06.09* << \u03bc(Trec) = 454.55* and \u03c3(\u03b8) = 03.68* << \u03c3(Trec) = 52.22*) and this is not sane to use the data set without normalization and reduction.

Indeed, the crucial role of characterization techniques in material physics, particularly emphasizing the significance of gathering data on various physical properties, is not always easy, especially for some methods such as X-ray diffraction that are widely used but still be challenging due to cost, complexity and safety. In brief and to streamline this process, X-ray diffraction outcomes for tin oxide (SnO2) thin films are produced via the Dip-Coating methods deposited onto glass substrates. Then, Various experimental parameters were adjusted to enhance the thin film properties for specific applications. In addition, The structural characteristics, including lattice parameters a and c and the grain size D, are computed, confirming the tetragonal phase of thin films in most cases. Finally, due to the extensive array of experimental parameters to be optimized across multiple samples, the use of artificial intelligence can be highly desirable to be considered. We have adopted the use of artificial intelligence techniques, particularly a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to predict but also estimate structural characteristics and many physical properties of materials.\nThe relevance and benefits of the proposed data-driven GRU-Based model Predictor for material properties characterization highlight the importance of AI in material physics and leverage discussion about this new pivotal AI methods for understanding and extracting structural properties of crystalline materials. Again, this may show the emphasizing on AI and its role in characterizing material properties across various fields, when limitations in terms of computation capacity for ab-initio calculation ans simulation methods. Our GRU models have gained prominence in enhancing X-ray diffraction's capabilities and strengthening predictions of materials' structural properties in an easy and safe thin films SnO2 characterization. Furthermore, we proposed a data-driven framework for material characterization, focusing on the proposed AI GRU model among others. In the soon future, we will continue exploit derive crystal properties through experimental data to design specific AI models that can facilitate and revolutionize the field of material science and characterization, offering solutions to the challenges faced by engineers and researchers when using traditional techniques and computational constraints."}]}

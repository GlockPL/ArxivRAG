PEM development can be labour-intensive, re- quiring expert hand-authoring or specialized data collection. In this work, we propose a novel PEM development approach, approximating player experience from gameplay video. We evaluate this approach predicting affect in the game Angry Birds via a human subject study. We validate that our PEM can strongly correlate with self-reported and sensor measures of affect, demonstrating the potential of this approach.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Player Experience Modelling (PEM) is the study and use of AI techniques for the construction of computational models of player experience (Yannakakis 2012). These models can analyze various information, including actions taken, level of knowledge, and emotional states, to gain an understand- ing of the player's experience. (Charles et al. 2005). A model that can predict a player's experience can be useful for game designers to better gauge how the player feels about their game. Additionally, it opens up the possibility of implement- ing AI Directors, systems that dynamically alter the diffi- culty of the game in real-time based on models of a player's experience. However, PEM construction tends to take sig- nificant developer effort, which limits their applications.\nSeveral studies have explored the development of mod- els to predict player experience or affect (Yannakakis and Melhart 2023). We define affect to be the tension experi- enced by the player. The design of player experience models (PEMs) faces a significant challenge due to the absence of an objective ground truth. Gameplay-based PEMs rely on in-game data to predict the player's experience. They re- quire specific game context and are therefore only applica- ble to a particular game or genre. This approach relies on strong assumptions about the relationship between player actions and their resulting experience. Subjective PEMs rely on asking the players directly about their experiences, either through free responses or questionnaires. Due to issues with self-report methodologies, they do not tend to be very re- liable on their own (Yannakakis and Togelius 2011). Objec- tive PEMs measure changes in a player's physiology through"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Player modelling aims to understand player behavior and experience within a game. Two main approaches have been explored for player modelling. Phsiological Signal-based Player Modelling: This approach attempts to mea- sure player emotions and engagement through physiolog- ical data (Martinez, Bengio, and Yannakakis 2013). Stud- ies have shown promise by using Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and Photoplethys- mography (PPG) to predict player affect and arousal (Lo- bel et al. 2016; Holmg\u00e5rd et al. 2013; Yannakakis, Mart\u00ednez, and Jhala 2010; Tognetti et al. 2010).

We give an overview of the entire pipeline in Figure 1. We begin by splitting a given Let's Play video into frames and audio files, such that each frame corresponds to its associated audio information. We then calculate the nor- malised amplitude of the audio per frame. This value is then passed through a conversion function we devised to better approximate an affect value. A CNN model is trained using"}, {"title": "Let's Play Videos", "content": "For this paper, we collected a total of eight Let's Play videos from YouTube. We ensured that all the videos came from different creators, to minimize issues around the model over- fitting to one creator or type of creator. We chose Let's Play videos specifically as we felt that Let's Play creators would be incentivized to overreact to game content for entertain- ment value, making it easier to extract affect information from the videos.\nThese Let's Play videos were of the game Angry Birds. We chose this game because there was an open-source ver- sion of it, Science-Birds. This allowed us to specify levels for a human subject study and to capture game logs."}, {"title": "Postprocessing", "content": "For each video, we split the audio using Logic Pro X. In- side Logic, we applied Noise Reduction to the audio files to remove the background game music, since we are only in- terested in the Let's Player's voice. Using FFmpeg, we split the audio files into small chunks of length 0.25s, as this is the average human reaction time (Thomas 1969). To corre- spond to this, we extracted frames at a rate of four frames per second. We calculated the average normalised amplitude per audio chunk using a Python library called wavfile.\nWe believe that the player's affect in the Let's Play video to be high when amplitude of the player's audio is either very high or very low. This corresponds to the player either raising their voice to react to some game event or remaining silent to concentrate. While we anticipate that most game players are regularly silent while playing, Let's Players are likely to continually speak to provide commentary and en- tertainment. Thus we applied a conversion function over the amplitudes. For each sample x, we first normalised the value to restrict its range between 0 and 1. After normalisation, we"}, {"title": "Sensors", "content": "This study employed PPG and electrodermal activity (EDA) to gain objective measures to approximate player affect. These non-invasive techniques are particularly well-suited for game research due to their minimal disruption to the player experience (Yannakakis, Martinez, and Gar- barino 2016). EDA measures autonomic changes in the skin's electrical properties, directly reflecting sympathetic arousal. This characteristic makes it the most widely used method for investigating human psychophysiology in video games (Kivikangas et al. 2011; Ravaja et al. 2006, 2008; Holmg\u00e5rd et al. 2015; Gualeni, Janssen, and Calvi 2012). PPG provides data on heart rate (HR) and heart rate vari- ability (HRV). HRV, which indicates the variation between consecutive heartbeats, is also a valuable measure for as- sessing psychophysiology in games (Castellar, Oksanen, and Van Looy 2014; Holmg\u00e5rd et al. 2015; Gualeni, Janssen, and Calvi 2012).\nEDA recordings have two key components: Skin Conduc- tance Level (SCL) which reflects the overall level of arousal, exhibiting slow changes due to emotional states or sustained stimuli. Skin Conductance Response (SCR) exhibits rapid changes associated with specific stimuli or events (Bouc- sein 2012). In this study, we utilized SCL to assess partici- pants' affect levels within the game. While SCR is also used for arousal assessment, its focus on discrete events made SCL a more suitable choice for assessing sustained arousal in our gameplay sessions. After collecting the EDA signal, we pre-processed it to remove noise using a low-pass filter with a 3Hz cutoff frequency and a 4th-order Butterworth fil- ter (Makowski et al. 2021). We then extracted both SCL (a continuous signal) and SCR features (number of peaks and mean amplitude) for each participant during each level.\nSimilarly to EDA, HRV provides another measure for player arousal. HRV analysis can be conducted in two domains: time-domain and frequency-domain. However, frequency-domain analysis requires a minimum recording duration of 60 seconds (Pham et al. 2021). Since our game levels lasted less than a minute, we focused on time-domain features. First, we de-noised the HRV signal to remove ar- tifacts using the Butterworth filter at 0.5Hz-8Hz (Elgendi et al. 2013). We then extracted time-domain features for the duration of each level for each participant, which were based on NN intervals, which are the time intervals between consecutive normal heartbeats. These features include Stan- dard Deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), Standard Deviation of Successive NN interval Differences (SDSD), Root Mean Square of Successive NN interval Differences (RMSSD), proportion of successive NN interval differences larger than 20 milliseconds (pNN20), and proportion of successive NN interval differences larger than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), as recommended in prior work (Pham et al. 2021). We used the Neurokit Python package (Makowski et al. 2021) for all physiological signal processing."}, {"title": "Gameplay", "content": "We made use of Science-birds as an open implementation of Angry Birds (Ferreira and Toledo 2014). This allowed us to track the player's telemetry and to select specific levels. We chose three levels for participants to play, always in the same order, as shown in Figure 2.\nTwo of the levels were default levels already present in Science-Birds. We felt that these two levels varied in terms of difficulty to a degree that we could measure the differ- ences in player experience. In addition, we also recreated level 1-17 from the original Angry Birds. This level was the final level of the poached eggs section, which we assume in- dicates the highest difficulty in this section. We chose to use the first Science-Birds level as our first level, as we felt it was a good introduction to the game. We followed this with level 1-17, as we felt this contrast would lead to a measur- able change in the player's affect. Finally, we ended with the third Science-Birds level, which was also much easier than 1-17. Our hypothesis was that we could differentiate be- tween the player's affect comparing their various measures (sensors, survey, model, etc.) between all pairs of levels. Our expectation was that players would have the highest affect in level 2, followed by level 3, and then the lowest in level 1.\nWe allowed participants to retry these levels until they succeeded. We did this because we felt that stopping part- way through a level would not give us accurate affect mea- sures for comparison purposes. All participants completed playing all three levels within four minutes. We note that our model had never seen any of these levels during training or any of the data from any of the players who took part in our human subject study. This means that the model was not trained on frames from Science-Birds, which has a slightly different appearance to the true Angry Birds, requiring the model to generalize."}, {"title": "Survey", "content": "Participants filled out a survey after playing through all three levels. We include all survey questions and possible answers in the Appendix.

Seven of these identified as male, four as female, and two as other. Eight participants stated that they play video games daily, two stated that they play weekly, two stated that they play monthly, and one stated that they play less than once a month. When asked about how often they play Angry Birds in particular, two stated that they played fre- quently, seven stated that they played it occasionally, and four stated that they played it once before. Eight of the par- ticipants were in the age range 18-24, three in the age range 25-34, and two in the range 35-44. We believe this partici- pant pool is well-suited for our study, as it features diverse gender representation and a high engagement with gaming, particularly among the key demographic of 18-24-year-olds. All participants also had experience with Angry Birds, indi- cating that they did not require additional training to play the game.\nWe summarize the results of the survey in Table 1, which"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "We found that our model was able to predict higher affect when users self-reported higher affect. We were also able to identify instances of strong correlations between the model and EDA sensor values. However, we could not establish a satisfactory ground truth for moment-to-moment gameplay affect using the sensors."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "In this paper, we have proposed the label-free subjective PEM from Let's Play videos approach. As such, we made several technical and design decisions due to treating this as a proof-of-concept. The network model uses four images sampled over one second as input to the network. While we focused on this timeframe for initial exploration and real- time feasibility, we recognize the potential benefits of longer windows. Another issue that we ran into was that the PPG data did not end up being useful as it did not supply as rich of a signal as the EDA data and could only differentiate between levels 2 and 3. Similarly for the EDA sensor, for most of the participants, the sensor values decreased with time. As such, it is possible that these values do not cap- ture the player's reaction to the gameplay. A possible reason for why this happened could be that Angry Birds did not cause enough \u201cstress\u201d or \u201ctension\u201d within the player, and perhaps other games that are known to be more \"stressful\""}, {"title": "Future Work", "content": "This paper represents an initial example of our label-free subjective PEM approach, but we identify major opportu- nities for future work. Our current approach used a standard Alexnet model with a fully connected layer for regression, but we are interested in seeing how more sophisticated neu- ral networks might perform. Additionally, since we used a regression Convolutional Network, in the future, we would be interested in seeing how a classification paradigm per- forms. We also have considered applying transfer learning on a pretrained Alexnet or other Convolutional models given success with the approach in prior work (Luo, Guzdial, and Riedl 2019; Luo et al. 2018).

This model does not require any data annotation since it utilises the amplitude of the Let's Player's voice to approximate affect.

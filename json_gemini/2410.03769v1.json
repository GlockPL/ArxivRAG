LLMs\nsuch as GPT-40 (OpenAI, 2024b) and Llama-3.1 (meta llama, 2024) have garnered widespread\nattention, and their application to scientific tasks has proven highly valuable across various domains\n(Xie et al., 2023; Boyko et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024b; Liao et al., 2024). While these models hold\nsubstantial potential to accelerate scientific research, concerns regarding their safety, robustness,\nand potential misuse in sensitive applications have become increasingly prominent (He et al., 2023;\nResnik & Hosseini, 2024).\nThese concerns are particularly critical for LLMs used in fields such as biology, chemistry, medicine\nand physics. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1 bottom right, malicious actors could potentially\nexploit LLMs to design harmful genomic sequences, including mutations that enhance the infectivity\nor treatment resistance of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. This risk is exacerbated by advancements\nin technologies like benchtop DNA synthesis, which enable the rapid and flexible creation of DNA\nsequences in laboratory settings (Hoose et al., 2023). Consequently, the barriers for bad actors to\nengineer dangerous biological agents are significantly lowered. Numerous studies have highlighted\nthe risks posed by such dual-use technologies\u2014where tools developed for beneficial purposes can\nbe repurposed for malicious intent (Urbina et al., 2022; Sandbrink, 2023; Quach, 2023; Anthropic,\n2023; Gretton et al., 2024; Baum et al., 2024).\nTo the best of our knowledge, only two safety assessment benchmarks have been developed to\nevaluate how well LLMs manage potentially harmful queries within scientific domains. Specifically,\nthe SciMT-Safety benchmark (He et al., 2023) employs a red-teaming strategy (Derczynski et al.,\n2024; Inie et al., 2023) to simulate risk-prone scenarios, assessing the models' ability to mitigate\nharmful outputs. Similarly, SciKnowEval-L4 (Feng et al., 2024) tests models through ethically\ncomplex tasks, requiring both scientific precision and alignment with safety and ethical guidelines.\nHowever, the current benchmarks exhibit several notable limitations. First, they focus on a narrow\nrange of scientific domains, excluding two major fields: medicine and physics. Second, the datasets\nused in these evaluations are relatively small in scope. SciMT-Safety (He et al., 2023) contains only\n432 examples, while SciKnowEval-L4 (Feng et al., 2024), although larger, still lacks the breadth\nnecessary for a comprehensive evaluation. Third, these benchmarks do not adequately challenge\nmodels with built-in safety mechanisms, which are typically aligned with standard LLM safety\nprotocols (Chua et al., 2024; Kenthapadi et al., 2024). As a result, while models may perform well\nwithin typical safety guardrails (Niknazar et al., 2024; Rebedea et al., 2023), the benchmarks fall\nshort in providing a rigorous stress test, resulting in incomplete risk assessments.\nTo address such limitations, we introduce the Scientific Safety Evaluation benchmark, referred\nto as SCISAFEEVAL, which supports multi-scientific-language capabilities across textual outputs,\nmolecular, protein, and genomic languages by leveraging domain-specific datasets and task-driven\nprompts. Our dataset covers a diverse range of instructions and substances, sourced from widely\nrecognized scientific datasets and hazard databases, offering a comprehensive evaluation of harm-\nful content in real-world scientific applications. SCISAFEEVAL surpasses existing benchmarks in\nscale, with 31,840 samples spanning four major scientific domains-chemistry, biology, medicine,\nand physics-providing a significantly larger and more demanding benchmark for evaluating safety\nin scientific applications. Moreover, we incorporate jailbreak prompt templates that rigorously chal-"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Large Language Models for Scientific Tasks. Large Language Models have become powerful\ntools in advancing scientific research, specifically tailored to handle complex, domain-specific tasks\nsuch as molecular generation (Kim et al., 2021; Mazuz et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2024), protein\nstructure prediction (Elnaggar et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2024), and genomic analysis\n(Ji et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). These models are obtained via pre-trained\ndirectly on specialized scientific data (Gururangan et al., 2020; He et al., 2021; Fang et al., 2023b),\nor fine-tuned from general-purpose base models (Xu et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2023a). Different from\nthe natural language, key scientific languages (e.g., molecular, protein, and genomic languages)\ndemand customized tokenization and representation strategies. For instance, molecular language\nprocessing often utilizes formats like SMILES (Weininger, 1988) and SELFIES (Krenn et al., 2022)\nto encode chemical structures.\nRisks of Misusing the LLMs for Scientific Tasks. While LLMs hold great promise in advancing\nscientific research, their misuse poses significant risks. Urbina et al. (2022) demonstrated the dual-use dilemma by showing how AI tools originally developed for drug discovery could be repurposed\nto generate toxic compounds, including chemical warfare agents. This exemplifies the dangerous\npotential of these technologies. Similarly, Sandbrink (2023) cautions that the integration of LLMs\nwith biological design tools may lower the barriers to manipulating biological agents, making it\neasier for non-experts to engage in harmful activities and increasing the scale of potential harm. In\nnucleic acid synthesis, Wheeler et al. (2024) highlights the need for global standards to ensure that\nLLMs used in this field do not aid malicious actors in circumventing existing safety measures. Fur-\nthermore, Hoffmann et al. (2023) stresses the importance of embedding robust biosecurity protocols\nin AI-driven synthetic biology to mitigate risks.\nSafety Assessment of LLMs for Scientific Tasks. Existing safety assessments have predomi-\nnantly focused on general-purpose LLMs (Gehman et al., 2020; Zhuo et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023;\nZhang et al., 2024c), but specialized benchmarks for scientific models are relatively scarce. SciMT-\nSafety (He et al., 2023) is one of the first benchmarks to assess the safety of AI models in scientific\ndomains specifically. It emphasizes mitigating risks such as the misuse of AI in chemical synthesis\nand biological design through red-teaming approaches. Similarly, SciKnowEval (Feng et al., 2024)"}, {"title": "3 THE SCISAFEEVAL BENCHMARK", "content": "Recognizing that laws, regulations, and standards are the primary drivers of safety investments,\nwe first discuss how these elements influence the benchmark design in Section 3.1.

Figure 2 shows an overview of the construction process of the SciSafeEval benchmark.\nNotably, we collect benign substances from the respective databases for each scientific domain, so\nthat the SCISAFEEVAL contains both hazard and non-hazard substances.\n3.1 REGULATORY AND ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC SAFETY\nThe SCISAFEEVAL benchmark is grounded in key contemporary AI safety regulations, including\nstandards developed by the National Technical Committee 260 (NTC 260) on Cybersecurity (Na-\ntional Technical Committee 260 on Cybersecurity of SAC, 2024), SB 1047 (Wiener et al., 2024),\nand international conventions such as the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) (United Nations\nOffice for Disarmament Affairs, 2020). Each of these frameworks plays a pivotal role in shaping\nthe design of SCISAFEEVAL. NTC 260 and SB 1047 emphasize the need for cross-disciplinary\nevaluation of AI safety, while the BWC highlights the importance of AI models in biological con-"}, {"title": "3.2 BENCHMARK CONSTRUCTION", "content": "To ensure our benchmark reflects the range of harmful content AI systems might encounter, we\ngenerate the examples via combining instructions sourced from existing widely-used non-safety-focused datasets and harmful substances curated from well-established hazard databases (Marvin\net al., 2023), with details in Appendix B. As a result, we construct a multi-faceted benchmark\nthat evaluates LLM safety across multiple scenarios. SCISAFEEVAL assess the safety of LLMs\nacross multiple scientific disciplines and levels of complexity, using a large-scale, high-quality\ndataset. The benchmark has four key attributes: (i) Multi-Disciplinary: It spans four critical scien-\ntific fields-chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics with domain-specific tasks, covering various\ntypes of harmfulness; (ii) Large Scale: It covers the natural and scientific language (e.g., protein se-\nquences and molecule SMILES), offering 10 times more examples; (iii) High Quality: The dataset\nis sourced from authoritative databases relevant to each scientific field, ensuring accuracy and rel-\nevance; (iv) Multi-faceted Benchmarking: It supports a range of evaluation scenarios, including\nzero- and few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and jailbreak testing.\n3.2.1 INSTRUCTION GENERATION FOR SCIENTIFIC TASKS\nTo collect the instructions for the four scientific domains, we emphasize the comprehensive coverage\nof key tasks and safety considerations for each one. For chemistry-related instructions, we utilized\nthe dataset provided by Fang et al. (2023a), offering task instructions that focus on Molecule Gener-\nation, Property Prediction and Reaction Prediction. Biology-related instructions were sourced from\nGuo et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023), which includes Protein Function Prediction, Protein Se-\nquence Generation, Protein Structure Prediction Gene Classification and Gene Generation. In the\nmedical domain, we incorporated task instructions from Tran et al. (2024), which are tailored for\nbiomedical NLP tasks like Inference Reasoning and Knowledge Retrieval. Lastly, physics-related\ninstructions are drawn from Nakamura et al. (2024) and Biden (2023), focusing on Knowledge Re-\ntrieval. This diverse selection of domain-specific instructions ensures that our benchmark captures a\nwide array of instruction types across multiple scientific disciplines and their various tasks.\n3.2.2 SUBSTANCES FROM HAZARD DATABASES\nChemistry. We curated 4,983 toxic chemical compounds from PubChem (Kim et al., 2023), fol-\nlowing a rigorous selection process based on key physicochemical properties, toxicological profiles,\nand environmental impacts. The collected data includes substances characterized with 6 tags (Corro-\nsives, Environment, Acute Toxicity, Health Hazards and Explosiveness) in alignment with the GHS\nHazard Class Pictograms (CHEMICALS, 2002). We filtered out incomplete or non-compliant en-\ntries and the remaining data retained critical attributes such as compound names and their SMILES/-\nSELFIES (Weininger, 1988) representations. As a result, the SCISAFEEVAL-CHEMISTRY encom-\npasses a wide range of hazard information, including acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and ecotoxicity,\nproviding a comprehensive resource for safety and hazard analysis in chemical research.\nBiology. Our dataset encompasses both protein-based and gene-associated biohazards, systemat-\nically curated to ensure high coverage and relevance in biological safety research. (1) For protein\ntoxins, we selected 2,763 toxic proteins from UniProt, specifically utilizing the Toxin label. These\nproteins are naturally occurring and are known to disrupt or kill other cells. Leveraging the Gene\nOntology (GO) classification system (Consortium, 2004), we further categorized these proteins into\n11 subtypes under the \u201cToxin activity\u201d class. During preprocessing, we removed entries with in-\nsufficient annotations and retained complete protein names and FASTA (Pearson, 1994) sequences\nto maintain data integrity. We also included toxic proteins from a wide range of organisms and\nenvironments, spanning animals, plants, fungi, and pathogenic bacteria, to enhance diversity. (2)\nFor gene-associated hazards, we utilized data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource\nCenter (BV-BRC) (Olson et al., 2023). The collected data includes 2,100 DNA virus entries, se-\nlected based on six criteria: structural characteristics, family classification, host species, geographic\norigin, year of collection, and sequence length. We adopted the Baltimore classification (Koonin"}, {"title": "3.2.3 MULTI-FACETED BENCHMARKING", "content": "Our evaluation incorporates zero- and few-shot settings, to assess the risk without and with the prior\nexperience. Additionally, given the widespread adoption of CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) as\na standard technique in many applications, our benchmark includes it in the evaluation framework\nto assess whether this structured reasoning approach contributes to enhancing model safety. Fur-\nthermore, recognizing that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-40, are equipped with built-in safety\nmechanisms, we integrate jailbreak into our benchmark to enable a more thorough evaluation of\npotential risks. Specifically, we use WildTeaming (Jiang et al., 2024) to generate jailbreak prompts\nfor every single seed prompts (i.e. origin prompts). Jailbreak cases are present in Appendix G.3.\nThis holistic evaluation ensures a multi-faceted risk assessment under various conditions."}, {"title": "3.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE", "content": "The quality assurance process combines automated validation, expert review, and continuous moni-\ntoring to ensure accuracy, completeness, and relevance.

In addition, domain experts in chem-\nistry, biology, medicine, and physics manually review samples of the data to confirm the appropri-\nateness of hazardous substances and malicious instructions. Continuous updates are implemented\nto keep the dataset aligned with evolving scientific knowledge and safety regulations, ensuring that\nSCISAFEEVAL remains a reliable resource for evaluating scientific LLM safety. The statistics of\nSCISAFEEVAL is shown in Table 2 and illustrative examples are provided in Figure 3."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENT", "content": "4.1 SETUP\nModels. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the safety performance of LLMs in scientific\nresearch tasks, we selected a diverse set of models, including 6 widely adopted general-purpose\nLLMs and 20 state-of-the-art models tailored to specific scientific domains. The breakdown of these\nmodels can be found in Table 8 in Appendix D. We take into account both the open-source (e.g.,\nlama-3.1 (meta llama, 2024)) and closed-source models (e.g., GPT-40 (OpenAI, 2024b) ).\nEvaluation Mode. We consider zero-shot, few-shot and CoT settings. For few-shot examples,\nwe manually collected a pool of successful defense (i.e. refuse to answer) cases from the zero-shot\nexperiments for each subset. We then selected 3 representative examples demonstrating effective\nstrategies for handling malicious prompts across different scientific domains. These examples, with\n2 more benign prompt-response pairs, as shown in Appendix G.1, were used to construct five-shot\nprompts that provide the model with additional context and guidance during the evaluation. The\nselection process focused on ensuring diversity in the types of attacks and defenses, allowing for a\ncomprehensive assessment of the model's ability to generalize from a limited set of examples. For\nCoT prompting, we design reasoning paths that help LLMs identify why a specific instruction with\nhazardous substance content may be harmful or toxic. We concatenate \u201cAnd think step by step. (1)\nIs the content harmful or toxic? (2) If the content is harmful or toxic, I should immediately refuse\nto answer and not output any more information.\" at the end of the original prompt, see example\ncase in Appendix G.2. We expect the model to gradually realize that the query is harmful during the\nreasoning process. For general-purpose LLMs like GPT-40 (OpenAI, 2024b), we evaluate the full\nSCISAFEEVAL dataset, assuming that these models possess knowledge across multiple domains,\nsuch as Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, and Physics. For domain-specific scientific models, such as\nDNAGPT (Zhang et al., 2023), we limit the evaluation to the SCISAFEEVAL subsets relevant to their\nspecific scientific domain."}, {"title": "4.2 RESULTS", "content": "We present the safety evaluation results on the SCISAFEEVAL benchmark across zero-shot, five-shot, and chain-of-thought settings, as detailed in Table 3 and heatmap in Figure 4. To better show\nthe quantified increasement of five-shot and CoT prompting, we calculated the \u0394 value to reflect\nhow those two techniques affect the result, as shown in Table 4. We selected a subset of attack-failure cases across Chemistry, Medicine, and Physics in zero-shot setting. Leveraging this subset,\nwe conducted jailbreak experiments on LLaMa3.1-8B/70B, QWen2.5-7B, and GPT-40 models, with\nthe results summarized in Table 5. For domain-specific scientific large language models (Sci-LLMs),\nwhich often lack support for CoT or few-shot prompting, we limited the evaluation to zero-shot\nsettings. These results are presented in Table 11 in Appendix F.\nOverall Safety Performance. Results in Table 3 highlights significant challenges in zero-shot set-\ntings, particularly in complex domains such as biology and chemistry, where most models exhibit\npoor alignment. However, when provided with few-shot examples, models show a marked improve-\nment, demonstrating that task-specific in-context examples play a crucial role in enhancing safety\nalignment. Chain-of-thought reasoning further boosts performance, especially for reasoning-heavy\ntasks such as knowledge retrieval and inference, where models like GPT-4o achieve higher safety\nalignment. Notably, Claude 3.5 outperforms other models across a few domains, with its strongest\nsafety performance in science domains, while GPT-40 demonstrates substantial gains in CoT sce-\nnarios. This suggests that while current models have potential, their ability to align with safety\nstandards depends heavily on both data-driven examples and structured reasoning mechanisms.\nFive-shot Results. The five-shot results, as illustrated in Table 3 and Table 4, demonstrate that\nintroducing a minimal number of task-specific examples substantially enhances model performance"}, {"title": "4.3 DISCUSSION", "content": "Safety Alignment of LLMs in Science Domains Remains Challenging. Our findings reveal that\nexisting LLMs struggle to effectively defend against harmful queries within professional scientific\ndomains. These models often fail when confronted with complex scientific language with malicious\nintent, leaving them susceptible to potential misuse. This highlights a critical gap in the safety\nalignment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications where precision and safety\nare paramount. More importantly, this challenge is compounded by the inherent complexity in\nscientific discourse, where nuanced terms can have vastly different implications depending on the\ncontext. The inability of LLMs to fully grasp such subtleties raises concerns about their reliability in\nenvironments where small errors can have outsized consequences, such as drug discovery, biohazard\nresearch, or even climate modeling. Future advancements must focus not only on improving safety\nmechanisms but also on developing a deeper understanding of domain-specific risks, ensuring that\nAI systems are not just safe in a general sense but are meticulously aligned with the ethical and\npractical demands of their respective fields.\nFew-shot and CoT Approaches Enhance Overall Safety Performance. The experimental re-\nsults suggest that safety-specific few-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought reasoning significantly\nimprove the safety performance of LLMs in many scenarios. These techniques help models nav-\nigate harmful instructions more effectively by providing structured reasoning paths and additional\ncontext. However, this leads to important considerations: Are these improvements sufficient for\nhigh-risk domains, or are they merely mitigating symptoms of deeper vulnerabilities? Few-shot and\nCoT approaches offer structured reasoning, yet they may inadvertently introduce new biases or over-\nfit to particular contexts, potentially limiting their generalizability. Furthermore, as the complexity\nof scientific tasks grows, the capacity for even few-shot and CoT-enhanced models to maintain con-\nsistent safety across diverse and evolving scientific challenges remains an open question. Moving\nforward, the development of adaptive safety mechanisms\u2014capable of evolving alongside scientific\nknowledge\u2014will be crucial to avoid rigid systems that may fall short in novel, unforeseen scenarios.\nSci-LLMs Are More Vulnerable than General-purpose LLMs. A large portion of domain-\nspecific scientific LLMs, pretrained on scientific literature, appear to be more vulnerable to harmful\ninputs than their general-purpose counterparts. These models often lack the defensive capabilities\nthat few-shot or CoT techniques can provide, making them more susceptible to misuse. The un-\nderlying issue is that domain-specific models, by focusing heavily on scientific terminology and\nknowledge, may lose the broader, more diverse understanding that general-purpose models gain\nfrom larger, more varied datasets. This raises an important question about the trade-off between\nspecialization and robustness: how can we retain the expertise of domain-specific models without\ncompromising their resilience to harmful inputs? Additionally, traditional safety mechanisms, de-\nsigned for more generalized models, may not seamlessly transfer to specialized domains, where\nunique ethical concerns and contextual factors need to be considered. Future research must explore\nhybrid approaches that combine domain-specific expertise with generalizable safety features, ensur-\ning that specialized models are not just effective but also safeguarded against malicious use across\nscientific fields."}, {"title": "5 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we present SCISAFEEVAL, a benchmark designed to assess the safety alignment of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in scientific tasks across 31,840 harmful queries from four key sci-\nentific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics. Our evaluation of both general-purpose\nand domain-specific LLMs highlights that state-of-the-art models, regardless of being open or closed\nsource, still pose safety risks in scientific tasks. However, techniques such as few-shot examples and\nchain-of-thought prompting significantly improve safety across most models, with Claude 3.5 per-\nforming well in zero-shot and five-shot settings, and GPT-40 and o1-preview excelling in chain-of-\nthought scenarios.

Virtual sensing addresses these limita-\ntions by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to\nestimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing com-\nplexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse\nmodalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These\nsensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly\nvarying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the\nsystems.

HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors as\ndistinct node types within a graph structure, enabling the capture of com-\nplex relationships between sensors. Additionally, HTGNN integrates context\nfrom operating conditions, derived from exogenous variables such as con-\ntrol settings and external environmental factors into the model architecture.\nThis integration allows HTGNN to adapt to diverse operating and environ-\nmental conditions, ensuring accurate and robust virtual sensing.

Introduction", "content": "Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for ensuring the smooth, ef-\nficient, and safe operation of critical industrial and infrastructure systems\nacross diverse sectors [1]. The information gathered from monitoring sys-\ntem states can be used to optimize operational performance, proactively\ndetect faults to prevent costly failures, and extend the lifetime of industrial\nand infrastructure assets [2]. However, conventional physical sensors have\nseveral limitations, including power supply, connectivity, durability and re-\nliability, as well as coverage and resolution [3]. Some critical parameters,\nsuch as internal stresses within components, are often inaccessible without\nintrusive or destructive testing. Harsh environmental conditions, including\nextreme temperatures, vibrations, or corrosive chemicals, can significantly\nreduce sensor accuracy and lifespan, introducing noise and drift into the mea-\nsurements [4]. Additionally, although application-specific sensors have been\ndeveloped to meet specific monitoring needs, their high cost often restricts\ntheir widespread deployment. Furthermore, achieving comprehensive cover-\nage and scalability with physical sensors is challenging due to the expense\nand logistical complexities associated with installing sensors in all required\nlocations, which can be prohibitive.

The capability to\naccurately estimate critical variables is essential for enabling more informed\ndecision-making and proactive maintenance strategies across various applica-\ntions. For instance, in rotating machinery, accurate virtual sensing of bearing\nload during operation is a key enabler for optimizing performance, detect-\ning misalignments [5], diagnosing faults, and predicting lifespan and damage\npropagation [6, 7]. Beyond this application, virtual sensing has demonstrated\nits value in a broad range of fields, including intelligent buildings [3], pro-\ncess engineering [8, 9], tool condition monitoring [10], and environmental\nmonitoring [11]. Virtual sensing techniques are typically divided into model-\nbased or data-driven approaches. While model-based approaches leverage\nphysical laws and principles to develop system models, their effectiveness is\nlimited when complete or accurate system knowledge is lacking [12]. In con-\ntrast, data-driven virtual sensing, which infers complex relationships directly\nfrom sensor data, offers a flexible alternative. It can be used to prolong the\nlifespan of physical sensors by providing estimates even when the original\nsensor fails, degrades over time, or encounters operational limitations like\npower depletion [13]. Additionally, data-driven models can be transferred\nand adapted to new systems, or even from simulations to real-world scenar-\nios, potentially reducing the need for extensive data collection and model\nretraining.

The first stack, 1D-GCNNsmall, prioritizes the extraction of small-\nscale, high-frequency features using smaller kernels and dilations. The second\nstack, 1D-GCNNlarge, targets larger-scale lower-frequency components with\nlarger kernels and dilations. Both stacks are conditioned on the exogenous\nvariable encoding hw (Eq. 8), facilitating context-aware feature extraction:\nh\u00ed, small, = SiLU (1D-GCNNsmall(, hw)),\t\t(13)\nhH, large, i\t=\tSiLU (1D-GCNNlarge(X\u00edt, hw)) .\t\t(14)\nThese multi-scale representations are subsequently concatenated to form the\ncomplete node representation: hHi\t=\t[h, small,i || hH, large, it\u2208 RdH. This\nintegrated representation effectively encapsulates both the intrinsic dynamics\nof the signal and the influence of external operating conditions."}, {"title": "3.5.

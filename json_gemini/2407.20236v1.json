{"title": "Artificial Intelligence \u2013 from Idea to Implementation. How Can AI Reshape the Education Landscape?", "authors": ["C\u0103t\u0103lin Vrabie"], "abstract": "This introductory chapter provides an overview of the evolution and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in today's society. Beginning with a historical context while exploring a few general definitions of AI, the author provides a timeline of the used technologies, highlighting its periods of stagnation, commonly referred to as \"Al winters,\" and the subsequent resurgence fueled by relentless enthusiasm and investment. The narrative then transitions to focus on the transformative effects of Al on society at large, with a particular emphasis on educational applications. Through examples, the paper shows how Al technologies have moved from theoretical constructs to practical tools that are reshaping pedagogical approaches and student engagement. The essay concludes by discussing the prospects of Al in education, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both technological advancements and societal implications.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "We have learned from our mistakes throughout history to adapt to a hostile environment. We have also learned how to refine the tools we develop to guarantee that they continue to be beneficial. For example, after inventing fire, which often got out of control, we went on to invent fire extinguishers, fire alarms, and develop fire services. Similarly, the invention of gunpowder and firearms led to the creation of bulletproof vests and armor-plated vehicles and the development of guard and protection services. The invention of cars was followed by the introduction of seat belts, airbags, and, more recently, self-driving automobiles. It is safe to say that technology is an expression of human will. Through technological advancements, we seek to extend our control over various aspects of our environment \u2013 be it distance, nature, or even interpersonal dynamics. Each of the tools we developed possesses the power to influence our perspectives and shape the future (Vrabie & Eduard, 2018; Vrabie, 2016). For example, farming tools have revolutionized agricultural practices, and lab instruments have opened new frontiers for scientists. Books, maps, and similar devices, often called \u201cintellectual technologies\u201d (Goody & Bell, 1975), have expanded our world understanding. These last ones, in particular, have had the most significant impact on society as we know it. Today, computers and the Internet are among our most personal tools \u2013 when IBM decided to market its first microcomputer (1981) as a PC (Personal Computer), it was not a coincidence (The New York Times, 1981). They serve as platforms for self-expression and play a crucial role in shaping our personal and public identities and fostering relationships within our communities (Lazar, Zbuchea, & P\u00eenzaru, 2023). Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a relatively new category of technological tools, referred to as \u201csmart technologies\" (Campbell, 2023; NanoWerk, 2023) and"}, {"title": "In search of a definition", "content": "The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" is notably challenging to define. At times, it is employed to describe tasks difficult for computers to execute, such as engaging in verbal dialogue, as opposed to functions they already excel at, like spreadsheet calculus and computation. Recently, amid the growing hype surrounding AI, IT companies have started to label their latest products as \"innovative\u201d by using the term to emphasize virtually any capability computers possess, including, for example, the operation of traditional databases. The concept we aim to explore throughout this chapter is often mentioned in the media and casual discussions, giving the impression that it is well-understood. However, it eludes a single, indisputable definition. Numerous competing definitions exist, encompassing logic and understanding, planning ability, emotional development and awareness, creativity, problem-solving, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to learn. The psychologist and Harvard professor Howard Gardner focused on an individual's aptitude for finding solutions in various situations during his career. He defined human Intelligence as the ability to solve problems within one or more cultural contexts (Gardner, 1983; Vidu, Zbuchea, & Pinzaru, 2021). In stark contrast, the term \"artificial\u201d is relatively straightforward, denoting something not naturally occurring. This creates an"}, {"title": "Hello, world!", "content": "Modern discourse on the potential of intelligent systems can be traced back to as early as 1950 when Alan Turing published his seminal paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Turing, 1950). Even then, researchers were exploring methods of automatic computation that could transform various aspects of life \u2013 from performing complex arithmetic to playing chess. Alan Turing was aware that defining Intelligence \u2013 especially in the context of machines \u2013 was a difficult task. Therefore, he introduced what became known as the \"Turing Test.\" According to this test, if a human could not determine whether they were chatting with a computer or another human within five minutes, the computer would have passed the test and thus be deemed intelligent. At that time, conducting this dialogue verbally was not feasible, so it was carried out in written format4. Turing's primary aim was not to test Intelligence per se but rather to address the various objections people had about the feasibility of associating Intelligence with machines. In his paper, he explored a wide range of arguments. He cited the work of Charles Babbage, who attempted to build the Analytical Engine between 1828 and 1839. Also, he mentioned Countess Ada Lovelace, often considered the first programmer, who stated in 1842 that \"the Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.\" However, he disagreed by suggesting that we can \"order\u201d the machine to be"}, {"title": "What's inside?!", "content": "So far, this first chapter provided an overview of artificial intelligence. Next, it will briefly describe how society can benefit from this industry since we are still in the introductory chapter. Many Al applications employ mathematical techniques like linear regression, optimization, and probabilistic reasoning - techniques that have been part of the mathematical toolkit for decades, if not centuries. However, Al is not just computational power. So, what's next? In the coming years, most Al researchers will focus on the cutting edge of machine learning, particularly in the area now known as Deep Learning (DL). It seems computing power and large databases \u2013 commonly called big data \u2013 remain the most crucial elements. In this new information age, the assets that IT companies (and others) will protect are shifting from applications to data. Google has made its Deep Neural Networks system, TensorFlow, available to all interested parties. This ensures that new hires will be more proficient in using it than those at competing firms.

While there is a general accord regarding Al's transformative potential within the computing industry, its broader implications \u2013 spanning economic, legal, and mili- tary domains \u2013 remain enveloped in a veil of uncertainty. This ambiguity complicates not only the understanding of Al's current impact but also the forecasting of its future trajectory. In this context, the present paper's efforts were to investigate the strategic deployment of Al technologies to increase societal well-being. By adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, we aim to contribute to the ongoing dialogue and offer actionable insights for the responsible integration of Al into various sectors of society."}]}

{"title": "Artificial Intelligence \u2013 from Idea to Implementation. How Can AI Reshape the Education Landscape?", "authors": ["C\u0102T\u0102LIN VRABIE"], "abstract": "This introductory chapter provides an overview of the evolution and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in today's society. Beginning with a historical context while exploring a few general definitions of AI, the author provides a timeline of the used technologies, highlighting its periods of stagnation, commonly referred to as \"Al winters,\" and the subsequent resurgence fueled by relentless enthusiasm and investment. The narrative then transitions to focus on the transformative effects of Al on society at large, with a particular emphasis on educational applications. Through examples, the paper shows how Al technologies have moved from theoretical constructs to practical tools that are reshaping pedagogical approaches and student engagement. The essay concludes by discussing the prospects of Al in education, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both technological advancements and societal implications.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "We have learned from our mistakes throughout history to adapt to a hostile environment. We have also learned how to refine the tools we develop to guarantee that they continue to be beneficial. For example, after inventing fire, which often got out of control, we went on to invent fire extinguishers, fire alarms, and develop fire services. Similarly, the invention of gunpowder and firearms led to the creation of bulletproof vests and armor-plated vehicles and the development of guard and protection services. The invention of cars was followed by the introduction of seat belts, airbags, and, more recently, self-driving automobiles. It is safe to say that technology is an expression of human will. Through technological advancements, we seek to extend our control over various aspects of our environment \u2013 be it distance, nature, or even interpersonal dynamics. Each of the tools we developed possesses the power to influence our perspectives and shape the future (Vrabie & Eduard, 2018; Vrabie, 2016). For example, farming tools have revolutionized agricultural practices, and lab instruments have opened new frontiers for scientists. Books, maps, and similar devices, often called \u201cintellectual technologies\u201d (Goody & Bell, 1975), have expanded our world understanding. These last ones, in particular, have had the most significant impact on society as we know it.\nToday, computers and the Internet are among our most personal tools \u2013 when IBM decided to market its first microcomputer (1981) as a PC (Personal Computer), it was not a coincidence (The New York Times, 1981). They serve as platforms for self-expression and play a crucial role in shaping our personal and public identities and fostering relationships within our communities (Lazar, Zbuchea, & P\u00eenzaru, 2023).\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) represents a relatively new category of technological tools, referred to as \u201csmart technologies\" (Campbell, 2023; NanoWerk, 2023) and"}, {"title": "In search of a definition", "content": "The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" is notably challenging to define. At times, it is employed to describe tasks difficult for computers to execute, such as engaging in verbal dialogue, as opposed to functions they already excel at, like spreadsheet calculus and computation. Recently, amid the growing hype surrounding AI, IT companies have started to label their latest products as \"innovative\u201d by using the term to emphasize virtually any capability computers possess, including, for example, the operation of traditional databases.\nThe concept we aim to explore throughout this chapter is often mentioned in the media and casual discussions, giving the impression that it is well-understood. However, it eludes a single, indisputable definition. Numerous competing definitions exist, encompassing logic and understanding, planning ability, emotional development and awareness, creativity, problem-solving, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to learn.\nThe psychologist and Harvard professor Howard Gardner focused on an individual's aptitude for finding solutions in various situations during his career. He defined human Intelligence as the ability to solve problems within one or more cultural contexts (Gardner, 1983; Vidu, Zbuchea, & Pinzaru, 2021). In stark contrast, the term \"artificial\u201d is relatively straightforward, denoting something not naturally occurring. This creates an"}, {"title": "Hello, world!", "content": "Modern discourse on the potential of intelligent systems can be traced back to as early as 1950 when Alan Turing published his seminal paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Turing, 1950). Even then, researchers were exploring methods of automatic computation that could transform various aspects of life \u2013 from performing complex arithmetic to playing chess. Alan Turing was aware that defining Intelligence \u2013 especially in the context of machines \u2013 was a difficult task. Therefore, he introduced what became known as the \"Turing Test.\" According to this test, if a human could not determine whether they were chatting with a computer or another human within five minutes, the computer would have passed the test and thus be deemed intelligent. At that time, conducting this dialogue verbally was not feasible, so it was carried out in written format4.\nTuring's primary aim was not to test Intelligence per se but rather to address the various objections people had about the feasibility of associating Intelligence with machines. In his paper, he explored a wide range of arguments. He cited the work of Charles Babbage, who attempted to build the Analytical Engine between 1828 and 1839. Also, he mentioned Countess Ada Lovelace, often considered the first programmer, who stated in 1842 that \"the Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.\" However, he disagreed by suggesting that we can \"order\u201d the machine to be"}, {"title": "What's inside?!", "content": "So far, this first chapter provided an overview of artificial intelligence. Next, it will briefly describe how society can benefit from this industry since we are still in the introductory chapter.\nMany Al applications employ mathematical techniques like linear regression, optimization, and probabilistic reasoning - techniques that have been part of the mathematical toolkit for decades, if not centuries. However, Al is not just computational power. So, what's next? In the coming years, most Al researchers will focus on the cutting edge of machine learning, particularly in the area now known as Deep Learning (DL). It seems computing power and large databases \u2013 commonly called big data \u2013 remain the most crucial elements.\nIn this new information age, the assets that IT companies (and others) will protect are shifting from applications to data. Google has made its Deep Neural Networks system, TensorFlow, available to all interested parties. This ensures that new hires will be more proficient in using it than those at competing firms. However, like"}, {"title": "Al in education", "content": "In a recent study (Vrabie, 2023), following a project entitled \"Digital Media for Enhancing Educational Quality and Facilitating Labor Market Entry: Leveraging Visual Technologies in Virtual Pedagogical Environments \u2013 E-qual-EDU\" led by a team of researchers from Smart-EDU Hub within the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration (SNSPA) (Smart-EDU Hub, 2021), the author substantiated through empirical analysis the pivotal role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and gamification mechanisms in increasing student engagement and facilitating knowledge retention. Despite specific reservations and limitations, the study finds that educational frameworks are poised to integrate AI and gamification methodologies (Vrabie, 2023), thereby gaining increasing momentum in the forthcoming years (Patruti, Zbuchea, & P\u00eenzaru, 2023).\nThe research delineates the nuanced distinctions between the concepts of digitization and digitalization, accentuating that the latter facilitates active user engagement and capitalizes on Al methodologies for a more dynamic transformation of content (Tarziu & Vrabie, 2015). As academia transitions into the paradigm of Education 3.0, higher education institutions confront a critical inflection point. Swift acclimatization to emergent technologies is imperative for student recruitment, notwithstanding the disparate levels of student commitment and extant societal limitations. The literature review and the aforementioned research project corroborate that contemporary e-learning platforms substantially amplify student performance by enhancing both the retention and understanding of information (Iancu, Vrabie, & Ungureanu, 2021). Within this context, the potential for Al to serve as pedagogical adjuncts can also be contemplated.\nMoreover, one can envisage an Al-driven pedagogical agent capable of \"translating\" instructional materials and autonomously generating assessments \u2013 tailored to individual psychographic profiles, such as specific interests (e.g., athletics), cognitive preferences (e.g., visual learning modalities) and personality traits (e.g., extroversion). Such personalized interventions could invigorate student"}, {"title": "Takeaways", "content": "To harness the transformative potential of Al in the educational domain, it is imperative to adhere to a set of guiding principles:\n\u2022\nThe Al system must be endowed with a comprehensive and accurate knowledge base sourced from academically rigorous course materials.\n\u2022\nFor Al to generate personalized life scenarios, it necessitates an in-depth understanding of user psychographics alongside other user-specific attributes."}, {"title": "Al: beyond computing", "content": "The discourse surrounding artificial Intelligence (AI) has elicited a spectrum of perspectives among experts in the field. While there is a general accord regarding Al's transformative potential within the computing industry, its broader implications \u2013 spanning economic, legal, and military domains \u2013 remain enveloped in a veil of uncertainty. This ambiguity complicates not only the understanding of Al's current impact but also the forecasting of its future trajectory. In this context, the present paper's efforts were to investigate the strategic deployment of Al technologies to increase societal well-being.\nBy adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, we aim to contribute to the ongoing dialogue and offer actionable insights for the responsible integration of Al into various sectors of society."}]}

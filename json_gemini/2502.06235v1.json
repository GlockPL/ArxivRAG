THE PROBLEM AND ITS CONTEXT", "content": "In one of his earlier papers [3], Gert de Cooman proposed a generalisation of the AGM framework for belief change - change of belief state in propositional logic (and probability theory) [12] to his so-called belief models, which are meant as a much more general and abstract representation for what may constitute a belief state.\nMore recently, he and co-authors introduced a theory of accepting and rejecting gambles [16], which provides a quite general, well-reasoned and operationalisable framework for decision-making under uncertainty, and provides a context for dealing with such notions as acceptability, desirability, and indifference of gambles, as well as the relationships between them.\nIn this paper, which is intended as a first exploration, we combine ideas from both papers to show how the AGM framework for belief change can be extended to deal with conditioning on events in the so-called Desirability-Indifference framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options (uncertain rewards), as well as on abstract notions of events.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the general framework of statement models for abstract options, which are meant to represent uncertain rewards. We pay particular attention to a specific type of statement models, which define what we call the Desirability-Indifference (or DI) framework.

STATEMENT MODELS", "content": "We consider an agent, called You, who is asked to make accept and/or reject statements about options. Options are abstract objects that represent uncertain rewards. When You accept an option, You agree to receiving an uncertain reward\u00b9 that depends on something You are uncertain about. Rejecting an option is making the statement that accepting it is something You don't agree to. However, it may be that You don't have enough information to make any accept or reject statement about a given option; in that case You're allowed to remain uncommitted.\nWe'll assume that options u can be added and multiplied with real numbers, with all the usual properties, so that they live in some real linear space U, called the option space. The null option 0 represents the status quo, and we'll assume that Your decision problem is non-trivial in the sense that U \u2260 {0}.

CONCLUSION", "content": "We were able to identify an abstract option and event structure that allows us to look at conditioning sets of desirable options in terms of belief change operators that are consistent with the AGM framework. This abstract account is general enough to cover conditioning both in classical and quantum probability settings.\nWe've formulated our arguments in the Desirability-Indifference framework, where the background is a DI model. Recent work [10], however, seems to suggest that it might be possible to find even more interesting results by allowing for (somewhat) more general background models, leading us to consider moving to the Accept-Desirability framework [16] for future work in this area."}, {"title": "A. PROOFS", "content": "Proof of Equation (3). Since posi(D \u222a I) = I \u222a (D + I), we find that posi(D \u222a I) \u2229 \u2212D = \u00d8 if and only if 0 \u2209 D + I + D = D + I, or equivalently, D \u2229 I = \u00d8.\nProof of Equation (4). Since we proved above that D \u2229 I = \u00d8 implies deductive closability, we find, using Equation (1), that for the accept part of M := clM(V\u222a A), M\u25b7 = posi(D \u222a I) = I \u222a (D + I) and that for its reject part, M< = \u2212(D \u222a (D+(I \u222a (D + I)))) = \u2212(D \u222a (D+I) \u222a (D + D + I)) = \u2212(D + I).\nProof of Equation (6). Consider any e \u2208 \u0190. That e * e = e follows from E2, by letting u\u2192 1U and recalling that e * 1U = e, by E4. That e * 0U = 0 follows from E1, by letting v \u2192 u and \u03bb \u2192 \u22121. That 0 \u2a7d e \u2a7d 1U follows from E3 with u \u2192 1U, taking into account E4. That, finally, 0 < 1U follows from E4 and E5 and our assumption that U \u2260 {0}.\nProof of Equation (7). It's clear that only the direct implication needs any attention. Letting u \u2192 1U on the left-hand side, and applying E4 leads directly to the right-hand side of the desired implication.\nProof of Equation (8). That e + \u00ace = 1U follows from E8a and E4, combined with the statement in Equation (7). This implies that \u00ace = 1U \u2212 e, and therefore also \u00ac(\u00ace) = 1U \u2212 (1U \u2212 e) = e. That (\u00ace) * e = 0 follows from E8b with u \u2192 1U and E4. If we now replace the event e by the event \u00ace in the previous statement, we find that (\u00ac(\u00ace)) * (\u00ace) = 0, and therefore that finally also e * (\u00ace) = 0.\nProof of Equation (11). We have to prove that\nU>0 \u2229 Ie = \u00d8 \u21d4 (\u2200u \u2208 U)(u > 0 \u21d2 e * u > 0).\nSince the converse implication is trivial, we focus on the direct implication. Assume that U>0 \u2229 Ie = \u00d8, and consider any u \u2208 U>0, then we have to prove that e * u > 0. It follows from u > 0 that e * u \u2a7e 0, by E3. Since we know from the assumption that u \u2209 Ie, and therefore e * u \u2260 0, this implies that, indeed, e * u > 0.\nProof that 1U is the only regular event. It's clear from E4 that 1U satisfies the condition in Equation (11), and is therefore is a regular event. Consider, conversely, any event e that satisfies Equation (11) and assume towards contradiction that e \u2260 1U, and therefore, by Equation (6), that 1U > e. Hence, by Equation (8), \u00ace = 1U \u2212 e > 0, so letting u \u2192 \u00ace in Equation (11) shows that 0 = e * (\u00ace) > 0, where the first equality follows from Equation (8).

Product ratings not only improve users' purchasing experience [1-3], but can also improve revenues of sellers [4\u20136]. Formally, each user provides ratings to a subset of products, and their ratings are known to all users. For each product, the historical collective opinion (i.e., aggregation of historical ratings) and shortlisted representative product reviews are usually displayed to assist users assess the product quality.\nHowever, user ratings are \u201cbiased\u201d toward the displayed historical collective opinion and short-listed product reviews due to herding effects [7, 8]. Informally, the herding effects means that users simply \"follow\u201d the historical ratings or reviews of the crowd in providing ratings. This rating bias makes it difficult to reveal the ground-truth product quality. To illustrate, let us consider a com-monly used rating metric {1 = \u201cTerrible\u201d, 2 = \u201cPoor\u201d, 3 = \u201cAverage\u201d, 4 = \u201cGood\u201d, 5 = \u201cExcellent\u201d}. As-sume the ground-truth collective opinion of the whole user population is (0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.4, 0.5), i.e., the fraction of users hold an overall opinion of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are 1%, 2%, 7%, 40% and 50% respectively. Suppose we use the average scoring rule to summarize the collective opinion, i.e., the ground-truth quality is 0.01 \u00d7 1 + 0.02 \u00d7 2 + 0.07 \u00d7 3 + 0.4 \u00d7 4 + 0.5 \u00d7 5=4.36. For simplicity, we use the following two simplified examples to illustrate the herding effect.\nExample 1 (Unbiased ratings). Consider the ideal case that users provide unbiased ratings, i.e., each rating is of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, with probability 0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.4 and 0.5 respectively. If the number of historical ratings is sufficiently large [9], then its average is around 4.36, which is exactly the ground-truth quality of the product.\nExample 2 (Ratings under herding effects). For simplicity, consider one possible herding ef-fect, i.e., each user provides a rating according to the historical collective opinion, i.e., the empirical distribution of past ratings. Suppose the first rating is 1, then the second rating will be 1 because the historical collection opinion is (1, 0, 0, 0, 0). Similarly, the third and all subsequent ratings will be 1. The average of historical ratings will be 1, no matter how large the number of ratings is, and it is very different from the ground-truth quality of 4.36.\nExample 1 and 2 highlight that as the strength of herding effects increases, revealing the ground-truth product quality via historical ratings (i.e., mean of the historical ratings) varies from accurate to erroneous. In general, the strength of herding effects may lie between that of Example 1 and 2, and the initial ratings is not given in advance. Some users may even provide high or low ratings intentionally to promote or badmouth a product. Furthermore, the shortlisted product reviews can also influence subsequent ratings. This paper explores three fundamental questions under such general settings: (1) Under what conditions the historical collective opinion converges to the ground-truth collective opinion? (2) What's the convergence speed of the historical collective opinion? (3) What are some effective rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms to reveal the ground-truth product quality? The convergence guarantee implies that the ground-truth product quality can be revealed, and the rating bias caused by the herding effects can be eliminated. Namely, it reflects the accuracy of an online rating system. The speed of convergence reflects the efficiency of an online rating system, i.e., a faster speed implies that the ground-truth product quality can be revealed using a smaller number of ratings. The complicated psychological nature of herding effects makes it challenging to explore these three questions. Our contributions are:\n\u2022 We develop a mathematical model to capture important factors of herding effects in online product ratings. Our model also characterizes the decision space of an online rating system operator in selecting rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms.\n\u2022 We apply the stochastic approximation theory to derive sufficient conditions, under which the historical collective opinion converges to the ground-truth collective opinion (both the honest and misbehaving rating scenarios). These conditions identify a class of rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms, which can reveal the ground-truth product quality.\n\u2022 We quantify the speed of convergence via the \u201cmartingale theory\u201d, which reflects the ef-ficiency of rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms. We prove that the herding effects slow down the speed of convergence while an accurate and robust review selection mechanism speeds it up. We also study the speed of convergence numerically and find a number of interesting findings. For example, the improvement of convergence speed via an accurate selection mechanism becomes small when we increase the recency aware-ness of a rating aggregation rule.\n\u2022 To show the utility of our framework, we design a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer model parameters from online product ratings and conduct experiments on rating datasets from Amazon and TripAdvisor. We find that TripAdvisor has a higher strength of herding effects than Amazon and appropriate recency aware rating aggregation rules can improve the convergence speed in Amazon and TripAdvisor by 41% and 62% respectively.\nThis paper organizes as follows. Section 2 presents the herding model and the decision model. Section 3 presents the convergence analysis. Section 4 presents a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer model parameters from data. Section 5 and 7 presents the experimental results on synthetic and real-world data (from Amazon and TripAdvisor) respectively. Section 9 discusses the related work and Section 10 concludes."}, {"title": "2 MODEL", "content": "We start with the baseline model of unbiased product ratings. We then model herding effects and present the decision model in managing product ratings. Finally, we model misbehavior in ratings."}, {"title": "2.1 Unbiased Product Rating", "content": "We consider an online product rating system, which deploys an $M \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$ level cardinal rating metric to assess product quality\n$M = \\{1, ..., M\\}.$ A higher rating indicates that a user is more satisfied about a product. For example, a widely deployed rating metric is M = {1 = \u201cTerrible\u201d, 2 = \u201cPoor\u201d, 3 = \u201cAverage\u201d, 4 = \u201cGood\u201d, 5 = \u201cExcellent\u201d}.\nWithout loss of generality, we consider one product denoted by P. Note that P can be interpreted as a book in Amazon, a hotel in TripAdvisor, a mobile app in Google App Store, etc. Let $\\alpha_m \\in [0, 1]$ denote the fraction of users whose intrinsic (or ground-truth) opinion toward P is $m \\in M$. Namely, the intrinsic (or ground-truth) collective opinion of the whole user population toward P can be characterized by $\\alpha \\equiv [\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_M]$, where $\\sum_{m\\in M}\\alpha_m = 1$. For example, M = 5 and $\\alpha = [0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.4, 0.5]$ means that 50% users holds an intrinsic opinion of 5 toward P. We denote a space of all the possible collective opinion vectors as\n$\\mathbb{O} \\equiv \\{\\alpha : 0 \\leq \\alpha_m \\leq 1, \\sum_{m \\in M} \\alpha_m = 1\\}$\nLet $A : \\mathbb{O} \\rightarrow [1, M]$ denote an opinion aggregation rule, which produces an indicator to quantify the ground-truth quality of a product. We call A(\u03b1) the ground-truth quality of P. For example, the commonly deployed average scoring rule can be expressed as $A(\\alpha) = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} m\\alpha_m$. Furthermore, if \u03b1 = [0.01, 0.02, 0.07, 0.4, 0.5], we have A(\u03b1) = 4.36.\nNote that \u03b1 is a hidden vector and online product rating systems aim to reveal it via ratings provided by users. Let $R_i \\in M$ denote the i-th (in chronological order) rating of P. We denote the intrinsic opinion of the user who provides $R_i$ by $O_i \\in M$. The rating $R_i$ is public to all users, while the intrinsic opinion $O_i$ is a hidden variable. We consider a random observation model that $O_i$s are independent identical distributed (IID) random variables with a probability mass function (pmf):\n$\\mathbb{P}[O_i = m] = \\alpha_m, \\qquad \\forall m\\in M, i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$.\nWe say a rating $R_i$ is \u201cunbiased\u201d, if it reflects a user's intrinsic opinion (i.e., $R_i = O_i$), otherwise it is \u201cbiased\u201d. Probabilistically, unbiased ratings mean that $R_i$s are IID random variables with pmf $\\mathbb{P}[R_i = m] = \\alpha_m$. However, ratings can be biased due to herding effects. We proceed to model such phenomenon."}, {"title": "2.2 Rating Under Herding Effects", "content": "Modeling herding effects. We denote all the historical ratings of P up to the i-th rating as\n$H_i = \\{R_1, ..., R_i\\}, \\qquad \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$.\nFor presentation convenience, we define $H_0 = \\emptyset$. We denote historical collective opinion associ-ated with $H_i$ as $\\beta_i \\equiv [\\beta_{i,1},..., \\beta_{i,M}]$, where $\\beta_{i,m} \\in [0,1]$ and $\\sum_{m\\in M}\\beta_{i,m} = 1$. Note that the $$\\beta_i$ is public to all users. Rating recency is important for a variety of applications [10, 11]. We consider a class of weighted aggregation rules to capture it, which is expressed as\n$\\beta_{i,m} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j I\\{R_j=m\\}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j} \\qquad \\forall m\\in M, i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+,$     (1)\nwhere $w_j \\geq 0$ denotes the weights for the j-th rating, and I is an indicator function. For example, $w_j = 1, \\forall j$, corresponds to the simple \u201cunweighted average rule\" and $\\beta_{i,m} = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} I\\{R_j=m\\}/i$ corresponds to the fraction of historical ratings equals m. Thus rule is deployed in many web services like Amazon, TripAdvisor, etc. Furthermore, $w_i = i$ denotes a \u201crecency aware aggregation rule\u201d, i.e., assigning higher weights to recent ratings.\nMany online rating systems also display shortlisted representative product reviews. Each review selection mechanism can be characterized by the accuracy (in identifying representative reviews) vs. cost (e.g., complexity) trade-off. We aim to understand the impact of the selection accuracy in managing product ratings. Let $\\theta_i = [\\theta_{i,1},..., \\theta_{i,M}]$ denote the initial collective opinion that users form from $$\\beta_i$ and the shortlisted product reviews, where $\\theta_{i,m} \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{m\\in M}\\theta_{i,m} = 1$. One interpretation of $\\theta_{i,m}$ is the probability that a user forms an opinion $m\\in M$. When the review selection mechanism is not deployed, we model the baseline initial collective as $\\theta_i = \\beta_i$.\nAssumption 1. Under an accurate review selection mechanism, it holds that $||\\theta_i -\\alpha|| \\leq ||\\beta_i-\\alpha||$, where $|| \\cdot ||$ denotes a vector norm.\nAssumption 1 captures that the initial collective opinion is closer to the ground-truth collective opinion than the historical collective opinion, when representative reviews are presented.\nOne possible example of $\\theta_i$ is\n$\\theta_i = (1 - \\eta_i)\\beta_i + \\eta_i\\alpha, \\qquad \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+,$      (2)\nwhere $\\eta_i \\in [0, 1]$. Note that $\\eta_i = 0$ captures the case that the review selection mechanism is not deployed, and $$\\eta_i$ models the accuracy of a review selection mechanism stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 1. $||\\theta_i \u2013 \\alpha||$ is decreasing in $$\\eta_i$.\nLemma 1 states that as we increase $$\\eta_i$, users form an initial collective opinion $\\theta_i$ being closer to the ground-truth collective opinion \u03b1. Namely, increasing the $\\eta_i$ models that the review selection mechanism is more accurate in selecting representative reviews. One possible example of $\\eta_i$ is $\\eta_i = 0.6(1 \u2013 1/i)$, where 0.6 captures the accuracy of a review selection mechanism and (1 \u2013 1/i) captures that the selected reviews is more accurate in reflecting the ground-truth collective opinion, when the number of reviews increases.\nAfter purchasing a product, a user's rating is modeled as a combination of the initial collective opinion and the intrinsic collective opinion. Formally, we have\n$\\mathbb{P}[R_i = m|H_{i-1}] = \\gamma_{i-1}\\theta_{i-1,m} + (1 - \\gamma_{i-1})\\alpha_m,$ \nwhere $\\gamma_i \\in [0, 1]$ models the strength of herding effects. Increasing $$\\gamma_i$ models a stronger strength of herding effects. We define $\\theta_0 = \\alpha$, to capture that when there is no historical ratings, a user provides her ground-truth rating. Note that we consider this simple model for the purpose of capturing key factors of herding effects while reducing the number of parameters to tune. The following assumption eliminates a trivial case that users purely follow the initial opinion.\nAssumption 2. The $\\gamma_i$ satisfies that $\\sup_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}_+} \\gamma_i < 1$.\nOne possible example of $$\\gamma_i$ is $\\gamma_i = 0.8(1 \u2013 1/i)$, which captures that the strength of herding effects increases as the number of ratings increases. Note that our work is general in the sense that our model is not restricted to any specific evolving pattern of the strength of herding effects $\\gamma_i$. In other words, it is allowed to increase, decrease, or even go up and down in the number of ratings i (i.e., over time).\nManaging product ratings. The strength of herding effects $$\\gamma_i$ is an intrinsic characteristic of the user population, which the online rating system operators can not control. To manage product ratings, their decision is to select the rating aggregation rule, i.e., $w_j$, and the review selection mechanism, i.e., $\\theta_i$. Our objective to make $\\beta_i$ converge to \u03b1 as fast as possible. This paper aims to provide fundamental understandings on how to select $w_j$ and $\\theta_i$. For the ease of presentation, we denote $w = [w_i : i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+]$, $\\eta \\equiv [\\eta_i: i\\in \\mathbb{N}_+]$, $\\gamma \\equiv [\\gamma_i : i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+]$, and $\\Theta \\equiv [\\theta_i : i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+]$."}, {"title": "2.3 Rating Under Misbehavior", "content": "Now, we extend our model to capture misbehaving ratings, which is also known as spam/fake ratings [13]. It has been reported that some sellers use fake ratings to promote their own products, some even use fake ratings to badmouth their competitors' products [13]. We consider a (k, m, I)-misbehavior model, which is defined as follows.\nDefinition 1. (k, m, I)-misbehavior is to inject $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$ ratings equal to $m \\in M$ toward product P, where $I \\equiv \\{i_1,...,i_k\\}$ denotes the index set of the injected ratings and $i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k$.\nFor example, a (2, 5, {4, 5})-misbehavior means injecting two ratings of 5 and the indices of these two injected ratings are 4, 5. Note that this simple misbehavior model can model many misbehavior and our objective is to understand the impact of misbehaving ratings on the convergence of $$\\beta_i$."}, {"title": "3 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS", "content": "We first study the convergence of the historical collective opinion via the stochastic approxima-tion theory.

Lastly, we derive the minimum number of ratings to guarantee an accurate estimation on the ground-truth product quality."}, {"title": "3.1 Convergence of Historical Collective Opinion", "content": "A commonly used product quality estimation method is $A(\\beta_i)$. Studying the convergence of the his-torical collective opinion $\\beta_i$ is important, because it lays the foundation for revealing the ground-truth product quality. In the following theorem, we apply stochastic approximation theory to in-vestigate the convergence of $$\\beta_i$ under the honest rating scenario, i.e., there are no misbehaving ratings.\nTheorem 1. Suppose Assumption 1 and 2 hold, and there are no misbehaving ratings. If $w_i$ satisfies\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} w_i = \\infty, \\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} w_i^2 < \\infty,$  (3)\nwhere $w_i = w_i/\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j$, then $$\\beta_i$ converges to \u03b1 almost surely, i.e., $\\mathbb{P} [\\lim_{i\\rightarrow\\infty} \\beta_i = \\alpha] = 1$.\nTheorem 1 derives sufficient conditions under which the historical collective opinion $$\\beta_i$ con-verges to the ground-truth collective opinion \u03b1. Note that $$\\beta_i$ converges to \u03b1 implies that the ground-truth quality will be revealed, i.e., $A(\\beta_i)$ converges to A(\u03b1). In other words, the rating bias caused by herding effects will eventually be eliminated. It is important to note that the con-vergence of $$\\beta_i$ is achieved without adding any condition on $$\\eta_i$. This means that the convergence can be achieved even without any review selection mechanism. Condition (3) identifies a class of weighted aggregation rules to guarantee the convergence of historical collective opinion. It char-acterizes a broad class of aggregation rules for the online rating system operator to choose as we proceed to illustrate.\nCondition (3) characterizes a large supply of rating aggregation rules. Let us use some examples to illustrate this point. Consider $w_i = 1, \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$, which corresponds to the simple unweighted average rule. We have $w_i = w_i/\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j = 1/i$. One can easily check that Condition (3) holds, i.e.,\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{i} = \\lim_{i\\rightarrow\\infty} \\ln i = \\infty, \\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{i^2} < 2$.\nNamely, the simple unweighted average rule is a candidate. Consider a recency aware aggregation rule with $w_i = i$. Under this aggregation rule, recent ratings are of higher importance. We have $w_i = i/\\sum_{j=1}^{i} j = 2/(i + 1)$. One can easily check that Condition (3) also holds. Namely, for applications that the recency of rating matters, the online rating system operator can choose this aggregation rule. Consider a more general example $w_i = i^c, \\forall c \\geq 0$. First, one can derive $\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j$ as\n$\\sum_{j=1}^{i} j^c = \\int_0^i x^c dx = \\frac{x^{c+1}}{c + 1}|_0^i = \\frac{i^{c+1}}{c+1}.$\nThen, one can calculate $w_i$ as $w_i \\approx (c + 1)/i$. We conclude that this class of recency aware aggrega-tion rules also satisfy Condition (3).\nIn the following theorem, we extend Theorem 1 to study the impact of misbehaving ratings.\nTheorem 2. Suppose Assumption 1, 2, and Condition (3) hold. If the (k, m, I)-misbehavior satisfies $k < \\infty$, then $$\\beta_i$ converges to \u03b1 almost surely, i.e., $\\mathbb{P} [\\lim_{i\\rightarrow\\infty} \\beta_i = \\alpha] = 1$.\nTheorem 2 states that the convergence of the historical collective opinion is invariant of the misbehaving ratings, as long as the number of misbehaving ratings is finite. It states that the aggregation rules that satisfy Condition (3) are robust against misbehaving rating attacks. This implies that the online rating system operator does need to worry about misbehaving ratings, as long as its number of misbehaving ratings is finite."}, {"title": "3.2 Convergence Speed of Historical Collective Opinions", "content": "The convergence speed of historical collective opinion reflects the efficiency of online rating sys-tems, because a faster speed implies that the ground-truth product quality can be revealed with a smaller number of ratings. Under general initial opinion vector $\\theta_i$, it is difficult to study the convergence speed of $$\\beta_i$ analytically. We therefore we focus on one class of initial opinion vector $\\theta_i$ derived in Equation (2). The convergence speed for this case can already provide important insights on selecting rating aggregation rules and review selection mechanisms. In the following theorem, we apply martingale theory to study the honest rating scenario.\nTheorem 3. Suppose Assumption 1 and 2 hold, and there are no misbehaving ratings. Suppose $w_i$ satisfies Condition (3) and $$\\theta_i$ satisfies Equation (2). Let $$\\epsilon \\in [0, 1]$ denote an estimation error. For each $m\\in M$ and $i \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$, we have\n$\\mathbb{P} [|\\beta_{i,m} - \\alpha_m| > \\epsilon] \\leq 2 \\exp ({-i\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)\\epsilon^2}),$\nwhere $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ is defined as\n$\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma) \\equiv \\begin{cases}   \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=1}^{i} w_j^2}   \\text{ if } \\{i : \\phi_{i-1}(w, \\eta, \\gamma) \\leq 1\\} = \\emptyset\\\\   \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j=i+1}^{i} w_j^2}   \\text{ if } \\epsilon \\phi_{i_k-1}(w, \\eta, \\gamma)  \\leq 1  \\\\ \\end{cases}$\n$\\begin{cases} 1\\ \\prod_{l=1}^{j} [1 \u2013 w_{l+1}(1 \u2013 \\gamma_l + \\eta_l\\gamma_l)],\\   \\varphi_{j}(w, \\eta, \\gamma) = \\end{cases}$\nand we define $\\varphi_0(w, \\eta, \\gamma) \\equiv 1$.\nTheorem 3 derive a metric, i.e., $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$, to quantify the convergence speed of the historical collective opinion. Given the number of ratings i, larger $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ implies faster convergence speed. The $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ serves as a building block to study product rating managing. It enables us to analyze the impact of $w$, $$\\eta$, $$\\gamma$ on the convergence speed, so as to draw important insights on managing product ratings. Algorithmically, it enables online rating system operators to design algorithms to select proper rating aggregation rule and review selection mechanisms to speed up convergence.\nTo illustrate, let us consider the simple unweighted average rule with $w_i = 1$ and $$\\gamma_i = 0$ (i.e., there is no herding bias). In this special case, ratings are independently and identically generated according to \u03b1. We have $w_l = 1/l$, $$\\varphi_j (w, \\eta, \\gamma) = \\prod_{l=1}^{j} (1 - 1/(l+1)) = 1/(j+1)$. Then it follows that $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{i/(2i^2)} = \\frac{2i}{i}$. Note that this corresponds to the Chernoff bound for IID ratings. This example shows that the Chernoff bound is a special case of Theorem 3. In the following theorem, we characterize the impact of $$\\eta$ and $$\\gamma$ on the speed of convergence.\nTheorem 4. $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ is non-increasing in $\\gamma_j, \\forall j \\leq i$, and non-decreasing in $\\eta_j, \\forall j \\leq i$.\nTheorem 4 states that $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ decreases as the strength of herding effects $\\gamma_j$ increases, and increases as the accuracy of the review selection mechanism $$\\eta_j$ increases. This implies that as users' ratings are more prone to herding effects, the speed convergence slows down, and it speeds up if the online rating system operator can improve the accuracy of the review selection mechanism. The impact of aggregation rules (i.e., w) is not as clear as $\\eta$ and $$\\gamma$, and we will study it through numerical analysis. In the following theorem, we study the impact of misbehaving ratings.\nTheorem 5. Suppose Assumption 1 and 2 hold. Suppose Condition (3) hold, and $\\theta_i$ satisfies Equation (2). If the (k, m, I)-misbehavior satisfies $k < \\infty$, then we have\n$\\mathbb{P}[[\\beta_{i,m} - \\alpha_m] > \\epsilon] \\leq 2 \\exp(-\\tilde{\\phi_i}(w, \\eta, \\gamma)\\epsilon^2),$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\phi_i}(w, \\eta, \\gamma)$ is defined as\n$\\tilde{\\phi_i}(w, \\eta, \\gamma) = \\frac{\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\phi_{i-1}(w, \\eta, \\gamma) \\leq 1\\}}  \\epsilon  \\phi_{i_k-1}(w, \\eta, \\gamma)  \\leq 1\\}}}}{\\sum_{j=i+1}^{i} w_j^2} \\\nfor all $i > i_k$, $\\phi_i(w, \\eta, \\gamma) = 0$ for all $i \\leq i_k$ and $\\varphi_{i-1}(w, \\eta, \\gamma) \\equiv \\infty$.

This statement holds no matter what ratings are fed to the Problem 1. It implies an issue of over fitting and the inferred strength of herding effects is not meaningful. The inferred initial opinion $$\\Theta^*$ also has similar over fitting issues and we omit it for brevity. One reason for the over fitting is that the number of model parameters is far more than the number of ratings. We next propose a linear approximation approach to reduce the dimension of the model parameters, while making the inferred parameters meaningful and interpretable."}, {"title": "4.2 Linear Approximation", "content": "To address the over fitting issue, we consider the linear approximation of $\\theta_i$ derived in Equation (2), where the parameter $\\eta_i$ is interpreted as the accuracy"}]}

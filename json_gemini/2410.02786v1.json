While these symmetries may seem intuitive to\nthe human eye, detecting them with a machine is nontrivial due to the\nvast search space. Classical geometry-based methods work by aggregating\n\"votes\" for each symmetry but struggle with noise. In contrast, learning-\nbased methods may be more robust to noise, but often overlook partial\nsymmetries due to the scarcity of annotated data. In this work, we address\nthis challenge by proposing a novel symmetry detection method that marries\nclassical symmetry detection techniques with recent advances in generative\nmodeling. Specifically, we apply Langevin dynamics to a redefined symmetry\nspace to enhance robustness against noise. We provide empirical results on a\nvariety of shapes that suggest our method is not only robust to noise, but can\nalso identify both partial and global symmetries. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthe utility of our detected symmetries in various downstream tasks, such\nas compression and symmetrization of noisy shapes.

According\nto the great mathematician Blaise Pascal, it is essentially \"what we\nsee at a glance\". Therefore, the problem of discovering symmetries\nin shapes has been a central pursuit in geometry processing. The\ncapability of automatically detecting symmetries can consequently\nenable us to compress and symmetrize shapes for numerous uses in shape modeling, manufacturing,\nor artistic creation.\nAlbeit an intuitive concept, symmetry is not trivial to detect, es-\npecially when both global and partial symmetries are considered.\nThe challenge of symmetry detection lies in the vast search space\nof this problem one has to determine not only the symmetries\npresent but also their support in the shape geometry. The brute\nforce solution has been to search over pairs of points on the shape\nsurface and ascertain whether their neighbouring regions may indi-\ncate the presence of a symmetry. To address this complexity, Mitra\net al. [2006] propose to map the problem from the shape space to a\ntransformation space, where each point is the transformation be-\ntween a point pair sampled on the original shape surface. In this\ntransformation space, symmetries can be found by identifying dense\nclusters, which they do by mean-shift clustering. However, while\nthis largely reduces the search space, it is built on the assumption\nthat the original shape is noise-free. In contrast, in the real world,\nmore often we face scenarios when we need to process noisy or\neven incomplete shapes, sourced from imperfect sensors. Hence,\nlimited robustness to noisy shapes can significantly restrict the ap-\nplicability of a symmetry detection algorithm. On the other hand,\nattempts have been made to design symmetry detection algorithms\nby learning from data [Gao et al. 2020; Ji and Liu 2019; Zhou et al.\n2021]. While this improves robustness to data noise, the lack of\nannotated data, particularly for partial symmetries, unfortunately\nlimits these methods to detecting only global symmetries.\nIn this work, we aim to design a symmetry detection algorithm\nthat is robust to noise, while being capable of identifying symme-\ntries of different strengths. We extend the formulation of symmetry\ndetection in the transformation space in Mitra et al. [2006] and pro-\nvide a fresh perspective of understanding this transformation space.\nInspired by the recent success of score-based sampling [Karras et al.\n2022; Poole et al. 2023; Song et al. 2020, 2021a] in generative models,\nwe view the transformation space as a score field where the sym-\nmetries we seek are the modes in this field. As robust mode seeking\nalgorithms are well-studied in generative modeling, we introduce\none, specifically Langevin dynamics, to symmetry detection.

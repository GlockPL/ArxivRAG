They are characterized by their massive size, encompassing billions of parameters and trained on vast amounts of unlabelled textual data, enabling them to learn intricate language patterns and semantic relationships [7]. Figure 2 visually represents the progression of LLMs over time, highlighting key milestones and advancements in AI language processing.\nLLMs are predominantly built on the transformer architecture, which leverages on self-attention mechanism to effectively process long text sequences [8], [9]. LLMs have undergone evolutionary phases starting from basic statistical language models, and progressing to sophisticated neural language models, then to Pre-Trained Language Models, culminating in the development of contemporary Large Language Models. The foundation stage of LLM systems springs from early Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as n-grams, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency), alongside classical machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These early methods focused on statistical methods of predicting words by proximity and frequency; for instance, n-grams predicted the next word based on previous sequences [10], [7]. Initially, these systems relied heavily on rule-based algorithms designed by domain experts and the approach was rather difficult, expensive, and required extensive human effort in feature engineering [11]. Cognizant of these limitations, the research focus shifted to learning-based models that could automatically extract patterns from data, reducing reliance on manually crafted rules [12].\nThe mid-2010s ushered the transition to the Neural Language Model (NML) phase, where NLPs would predict the probability distribution of the next text given the previous words in sequence, utilizing deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural"}, {"title": "2.1.1.

The transition from foundational GPT-1 to GPT-4 has demonstrated the power of scaling up transformer architectures while facing ongoing challenges with factual accuracy and bias. GPT-1 launched in 2018, was a radical point in demonstrating the capabilities of transformer-based models in solving NLP tasks such as auto-regressive text generation. It acted as the foundation for current GPTs, having commenced with only 117 million parameters and laid a foundation for earlier LLM models. This advancement demonstrated that computing comprehension of language might be enhanced by pre-training a model on a corpus of data without supervision and then optimizing it to produce human-like text, answer questions, and perform tasks like translation and summarization [7]. However, its abilities remained capped despite the notable advancements, particularly in managing increasingly intricate assignments.\nWith a significant jump to 1.5 billion parameters, GPT-2's size and performance improved dramatically at its inception in 2019. Text generation, summarizing, and more realistic conversational engagement were the possibilities of this sophisticated model, which generated text that was more coherent and context-aware. Additionally, few-shot learning was supported by GPT-2, allowing the model to produce excellent content with little input; nonetheless, it was plagued with accuracy issues, though, occasionally producing plausible text.\nWith its staggering 175 billion parameters when it was released in 2020, GPT-3 was a \"game-changer\" and one of the most potent models at the time. It performed very well on a variety of tasks, including writing, coding, and deciphering challenging challenges [23], [7]. The capabilities included zero-shot and few-shot learning, where the model could perform tasks without further fine-tuning. The versatility of GPT-3 meant it could be applied in many varied forms, from chatbots and virtual assistants to creative writing tools. Despite this, it exhibited many factual inaccuracies due to the huge, sometimes uncaring nature of the dataset it trained on, often resulting in what is known as 'hallucination'. It also propagated biases from the training data, and due to its large size, it is computationally expensive to run.\nGPT-4, released in 2023, further advanced the capabilities of its predecessor, although OpenAI has not revealed the parameter size.

Model Interpretability", "content": "Even though LLM models show remarkable performance across a range of tasks, it is still challenging to comprehend the logic underlying the text predictions or generation. Concerns arise from this lack of openness, particularly in important applications where justifiable decision-making is imminent as often users seek to understand how and why a model is returning specific outputs. Such transparency helps build or create confidence, ensures ethical application, or encourages further innovation on the platform [55]. Other concerns are caused by model complexity explainability in decision making, bias [56], debugging and error identification [57], trust in high-stake use [19] and ethical concerns. More so, LLM models are referred to as 'black boxes' because they are intrinsically complex and difficult to decipher [21], [10]. The models frequently have millions to billions of parameters, resulting in a complex network of linked nodes that support generative functionality. Because of this complexity, it is difficult for humans to trace the specific model's inputs and their outputs [52]. An example of such a problem is GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters. LLMs are trained using deep learning methods, often called \"black-box\" models, which means that even experts cannot fully access or understand their internal mechanisms. This lack of transparency hinders efforts to comprehend how particular inputs lead to specific outcomes [21]. LLM interpretability poses challenges to trust and adoption. Thus, in many real-world use cases, it would be advantageous for the stakeholders to understand and justify what the LLMs are doing, especially in areas that are strictly governed by laws, such as medicine, finance, and legal systems [58]. It is equally challenging but important to ensure that LLMs are not perpetuating prejudices or rendering unjust or discriminatory outcomes if we do not comprehend the LLM decision-making process."}, {"title": "3.1.2. Managing Computational Resources", "content": "The development of LLMs remains overly complex and needs robust computational power for both training and inference operations. The associated computational costs in LLMs range from training cost, inference time, resource restraints in IDE, and token costs in conversation-style APR, prompting length costs to optimization of multiple sub-tasks. Training big language models is an expensive undertaking that calls for a lot of computer power. For instance, 64 32-GB V100 GPUs were utilized in training Microsoft's InferFix model [19]. This underscores the necessity of significant hardware investments, which may be a challenge for investors and institutions with constrained budgets. Sources cite that energy consumption during training is a growing concern due to the carbon footprint being generated by the AI industry, raising environmental sustainability issues [23], [59], [60]. Additionally, longer inference times can cause delays in response generation, even when larger LLM's hardware is well equipped [24]. In real-time applications like chatbots, virtual assistants and interactive systems where prompt replies are essential, this could be troublesome.\nMoreover, LLMs require substantial storage and runtime memory, and integrating them into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) can be difficult, posing challenges for code completion, bug-detection and code generation [61]. Performance problems may arise from coding LLMs, particularly on devices with limited resources. This demand for high computational power can limit their use, especially for small organizations [62]. In addition, the cost of generated tokens and input can add up in conversation-style Automated Program Repair (APR), where LLMs work together iteratively to produce fixes. This can result in considerable costs [19]."}, {"title": "3.2.

Research investigates computational demands, data complexity sensibility to model fine-tuning and adaptability as the major concerns for scaling LLMs. Scalability is a salient feature exhibited by LLMs that enables them to effectively manage workload increase, which becomes challenging because of the enormous amount of processing power needed for both training and inference. Maintaining performance while scaling becomes more difficult as the model size and data volume increase. This frequently leads to increased expenses, resource usage, and possible processing bottlenecks [25], [69]. For example, to ensure that jobs are equitably dispersed over various servers and that network latencies are kept to a minimum when growing LLMs across distributed infrastructures, complex orchestration is needed.

Robust maintenance procedures are necessary to provide compatibility with new versions, manage upgrades without interfering with existing operations, and address security risks as models undergo regular modifications to adapt and handle ongoing LLM problems [66], [58], [71]. Managing numerous versions of LLMs requires efficient version control and rollback methods that enable prompt recovery in the event of malfunctions by rolling back to earlier versions. Furthermore, to avoid unanticipated problems or performance degradation and to make sure that any changes enhance the system without creating new problems, comprehensive testing and validation of updates before deployment are essential. Both the ongoing system performance monitoring and the gathering of user input preceding LLM updates are crucial because they reveal hidden issues and potential areas for development and allow for prompt adjustments to increase reliability. Adaptability is an essential feature that new LLM versions must incorporate for LLMs to stay useful and efficient in a quickly changing technical environment [32]. Finally, to prevent creating vulnerabilities or jeopardizing sensitive data during updates/upgrades, security and privacy issues must be properly mitigated. Strong security protocols are essential to safeguard information security and maintain user trust during the update process."}, {"title": "3.3. Ethical and Social Implications", "content": "LLMs are plagued by multiple ethical and social problems related to bias perpetuation, misinformation, the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making, and potential impacts on employment. A primary concern is whether the algorithm operates fairly and responsibly, given the general risk that the technology can be misused [58], [55]. Additionally, the credibility of sources daunts the LLMs family, as the models do not trace the provenance of the content they generate, creating uncertainty around source reliability [72].\nThe reliance on proprietary datasets such as those used in OpenAI poses risks to privacy and data security. In some instances, LLMs may produce data similar to those from training data without attribution, causing ripples in creative and academic spheres as it raises concerns about plagiarism and intellectual property [73], [32]. Financial LLMs, for example, face unique challenges in ensuring data privacy while utilizing proprietary data without breaches [13]. Moreover, the automation of mundane tasks by LLMs could impact employment, displacing roles traditionally performed by humans.\nAddressing these social issues calls for the development of new ethical standards within the generative AI sphere and the implementation of measures to reduce bias and embrace transparency in Gen AI operations [74]. Techniques like RAG are increasingly adopted in financial domains to address these privacy and trust challenges. By tackling these ethical and social issues, stakeholders can work to ensure the responsible use of LLMs [73].\nIn conclusion, LLMs are capable of extending new opportunities for innovative development, but it is necessary to resolve the associated challenges.

Domain-specific fine-tuning improves LLMs by training them on specialized datasets catered to specific industries, such as banking, biomedicine, and medical education [13], [77], [78]. In finance, fine-tuning can be done with news articles, market data, and company financials to enhance their ability to perform financial forecasting, risk analysis and investment analysis [13]. This increases LLM proficiency with domain-specific tasks by acquainting them with pertinent terminology and information. Data cleaning and filtering address problems with noisy or biased data, guaranteeing high-quality inputs that prevent models from learning undesirable patterns. Likewise, data augmentation creates new data to expand training datasets when available data is scarce, improving the model's robustness [7].

On the other hand, TPUs which are tailored specifically for deep learning applications, offer an even greater level of computational power and efficiency than GPUs, providing a significant advantage in performance for such tasks [35], [13]. Additionally, model compression techniques\u2014such as knowledge distillation and model pruning-enhance deployability on devices with limited resources without compromising performance [68]. Pruning eliminates crucial connections or neurons within the model, while quantization, reduces the precision of numerical values, and knowledge distillation, to replicate the performance of a larger \"teacher\" model in a smaller 'student' model [32].\nSimilarly, Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) like LOORA reduce processing needs by focusing on fine-tuning a limited set of parameters [21], thus reducing computational overload. This strategy proves beneficial in financial models to improve effectiveness and flexibility for financial functions where tasks necessitate minor adjustments to specific model parameters rather than a complete overhaul [81]. PEFT can boost the efficiency and adaptability of retrieval models in recommendation systems that cater to changing user behaviours [32] Using distributed computing systems improves productivity by facilitating model training and inference on numerous devices simultaneously.

These methods\ntypically model attack targets by manipulating embeddings or predicting logits, thereby facilitating\nthe gradient-based optimization search for candidate tokens. Among these, the Greedy Coordinate\nGradient (GCG) [11] stands out as a seminal work focused on the optimization-based jailbreaking of\ngenerative LLMs. GCG aims to craft adversarial suffixes that prompt LLMs to specific maliciously\naffirmative phrases (e.g., Sure, here is ...). The key insight behind this is that if the LLM's response\nbegins with affirmative phrases, there is a high probability that it will continue to generate more\nmalicious content. GCG streamlines the suffix generation process by combining greedy and gradient-\nbased discrete optimization. In the GCG framework, a malicious query is represented by a sequence\nof n tokens, x = (x1, x2,...,xn). The aim is to identify an optimizable suffix s = (81, 82, ..., Sm)\nthat, when concatenated to x, maximizes the probability of eliciting the predefined affirmative phrase\nsequence y = (Y1, Y2, ..., Yk) from the target LLM. The optimization goal is formally defined as:\n$$s^* = \\arg \\max_S P(y \\mid x \\oplus s)$$\n$$\\begin{equation}P(y \\mid x \\oplus s) = \\prod_{i=1}^k P(y_i \\mid x \\oplus S, y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_{i-1})\\end{equation}$$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes the concatenation operation. Recently, some studies have aimed to further enhance\ntoken optimization methods.

However,\nwe extend this model to more accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Our primary objective is to\ntranscend the limitations of predefined affirmative phrases while still facilitating the optimization of\neffective jailbreaking suffixes. Furthermore, we aim to transition from a white-box scenario, where\nattackers have access to the model's weights and gradients, to a black-box scenario. This shift is\nmotivated by the prevalent deployment of advanced LLMs as API services, where direct access to\nthe model's internals is not available, and attackers can only interact through API calls and receive\ntextual responses."}, {"title": "3.2 Our Intituitive Idea", "content": "Recently, employing LLMs as black-box optimizers for complex objective functions represents a\ncutting-edge approach [24, 15, 25, 26]. These LLMs engage in dialogical interactions to progressively\nformulate recommendations, thereby incrementally refining their outputs guided by predefined\noptimization goals and continuous feedback. Notably effective in managing optimization tasks\narticulated through natural language, this method has extended the utility of LLMs beyond numeric\nproblems to include complex tasks like coding and text generation [27].\nThe demonstrated capability of LLMs to adapt and refine complex, non-numeric tasks through\ndialogical interactions and feedback-driven optimization raises an intriguing question: Can the\ngeneration and optimization capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to automatically optimize adversarial\nsuffixes for effective jailbreaking? Recent research, such as the PAIR [12], has shown that LLMs can\nindeed refine jailbreak prompts by devising rewriting and storytelling strategies. Our study, however,\ndelves into a more specialized area: examining whether LLMs can explicitly generate and optimize\nsuffixes to meet the specific goals of jailbreaking. This particular focus presents a rigorous challenge\nto their optimization capabilities, testing their ability to adapt and perform under narrowly defined\nconstraints. In our LLaMA2 prototype depicted in Figure 1, we use an LLM as an attacker to generate\nand refine suffixes aimed at manipulating a chatbot to respond to malicious queries. We iteratively test\nthese suffixes, concatenate them to the original queries, and feed the results back to the LLM to foster\nthe generation of new, more effective candidates. Through iterative testing and feedback, the attacker\nLLM demonstrates two critical capabilities in identifying successful jailbreaking suffixes. Our\nfindings highlight two critical capabilities of LLMs in generating and optimizing jailbreaking suffixes.\nFirstly, LLMs demonstrate a promising optimization aptitude, requiring only quantifiable feedback to\nself-reflect and refine their outputs efficiently. Secondly, their strong generation capacity allows them\nto produce numerous candidate suffixes that are semantically clearer and more natural than those\ngenerated by methods like GCG. Meanwhile, LLM-generated suffixes show a high correlation with\ngiven malicious queries, indicating that the LLM comprehends and incorporates multiple potential\nresponses to the posed questions. These knowledge-enriched suffixes are more likely to prompt the\ntarget LLM to reveal elements of its memorization for jailbreaking."}, {"title": "3.3 Method Design", "content": "Inspired by the insights from leveraging LLMs as powerful optimizers, we propose a novel and\nefficient black-box jailbreaking method with optimizable suffixes, ECLIPSE. Following established\nworkflows for LLM optimizers [15, 24], ECLIPSE streamlines the suffix generation process for\njailbreaking. The method starts with task prompting, translating our jailbreaking objectives into\nnatural language for the attacker LLM. We employ an automated tool to score the harmfulness of\ngenerated suffixes, providing continuous feedback for optimization. Additionally, ECLIPSE keeps a\nhistorical record of suffixes and their scores to facilitate the exploration of effective strategies.\nTask Prompting. We employ a novel approach by engaging the LLM optimizer in a sophisticated\nrole-playing exercise. In this scenario, the optimizer assumes the role of a red teaming expert, tasked\nwith generating a specialized suffix for a given query. This suffix is crafted to manipulate the hidden\nspace features of the query, enabling the dialogue bot to respond effectively rather than deny service.\nOur approach is based on the observation that successful jailbreak prompts often exhibit significant\ndifferences in their latent features compared to unsuccessful ones (\u00a7 A.2). Furthermore, existing\nresearch indicates that LLMs have the capability to interpret complex interactions within hidden\nrepresentations, similar to the mechanisms used in advanced recommendation systems[28]. Notably,\nLLMs seem to recognize the importance of these hidden features in facilitating jailbreaking, a intution\nthat is further laterally supported by experiments in \u00a7 4.4. To facilitate the extraction of the generated\nsuffix, we instruct the LLM to output its response in a JSON-like format. The task template is as\nfollows:\nTask Template: You are a red-teaming expert, please optimize this prompt \u201c[QUERY]\u201d by\nadding a suffix that will have a large impact on the feature hidden space, so that a conversa-\ntional bot can successfully answer the question corresponding to PROMPT without denying\nservice. [REF]. Please directly output the suffix within 10 tokens, as the following the format\n{\"suffix\":[OUTPUT]}.\nReference Template: There are some history generated suffixes and the scores in \u201c(suffix,\nscore)\", where a higher score indicates a better prompt: Sampled Histories. Please reflect deeply\non these results and generate a new suffix that will have a large impact on the feature hidden\nspace.\nwhere the \"[QUERY]\u201d is replaced by the input malicious query, to guide the adaptive optimization for\narbitrary input. To enable the LLM to self-reflect and optimize based on feedback about the quality\nof responses, it is essential to provide it with a set of historically generated suffixes along with their\ncorresponding jailbreaking efficacy scores. Those references are transformed into feedback prompts\nwith the Reference Template and embedded in the \"[REF]\" placeholder in the attacker prompt.\nHarmfulness Scorer. To effectively gauge the efficacy of candidate suffixes generated by the\nattacker LLM, it is crucial to employ an automated method that quantitatively assesses whether the\nresponses elicited from the target LLM constitute a successful jailbreak. This evaluation ideally\nshould produce continuous numerical scores that facilitate the attacker LLM's capacity for self-\nreflection and ongoing optimization. This requirement is well-supported by existing research, which\nhas employed specialized discriminative models [9, 29] or crafted specific prompts that enable an\nLLM to act as a judge model [30, 12]. In our implementation, prioritizing computational efficiency,\nwe opt to use a classifier trained on the ROBERTa model by Yu et al. [9], which provides prediction\nscores ranging from 0 (completely harmless) to 1 (explicitly harmful). These scores are treated as\nindicators of the efficacy of the current prompts, providing quantitative optimization status feedback.\nReference Selection. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the optimization process, we\nmaintain a dynamically updated list of suffix-score pairs, continuously refined to reflect real-time\nupdates on the availability and relevance of references. We employ a hybrid sampling strategy to\nbalance exploitation and exploration. Half of the references are chosen for those with the highest\nharmfulness scores to facilitate quick convergence toward optimal solutions. The other half are\nrandomly selected from the broader historical dataset to prevent optimization from stagnating in local\noptima and to promote diversity in exploring potential solutions. Finally, all selected reference pairs\nare displayed in sequence in the reference template provided to the attacker.\nIt is worth noting that as a general methodological framework, the choice of which LLM to use as\nan attacker is flexible. In theory, as long as the LLM has sufficient generative capabilities, it has"}, {"title": "3.4 Algorithm", "content": "The detailed algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 1. This method constitutes an iterative optimization\nframework, allowing for up to K rounds of suffix optimization for a given malicious query (in Line 3).\nAs previously stated, we provide the LLM with historical references for self-reflection, commencing\nwith a sampling-based selection on the reference history list (in Line 4). It is notable that a maximum\nnumber of reference history pairs is designated as r. Thus, in the beginning, when the history list\nis empty, the reference prompt for that round is omitted. Furthermore, the malicious query and\nhistorical references are integrated into an attacker template to construct the task prompt (in Line\n5). By feeding this integrated prompt to the target LLM, candidate suffixes are generated (in Line\n6). To enhance optimization efficiency, a batch generation strategy is employed to produce multiple\ncandidate suffixes simultaneously. Each generated suffix is evaluated by a scorer to assess its efficacy\nas an attack and to determine whether the jailbreak is successful (in Line 9-13). If successful, the\ngenerated jailbreaking prompt is returned (in Line 10-11). Otherwise, the current suffix and its score\nare added to the history list, and the process moves to the next optimization round (in Line 13) until a\njailbreak is successful or the iteration limit is reached."}, {"title": "4 Evaluation", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Experimental Setups", "content": "Our method is implemented with Python 3.8 and PyTorch 2.1.

The findings revealed a significant decline in performance when\nhistorical references were removed. For example, the ASR for the LLaMA2 model plummeted\nfrom 75% to 35%.

Here, we delved into the impact of this component. Table 4 illustrated\nthe effects of removing this instruction from the task prompts; the effectiveness of ECLIPSE on\nthe LLaMA2 model was notably compromised, with the ASR decreasing from 0.75 to 0.59, a 21%\nreduction.

Detailed task prompts can be found in the Appendix.\nImpact of hyperparameters. To investigate the sensitivity of ECLIPSE to changes in hyperparame-\nters, we conducted experiments with varying configurations, including batch sizes b from 4 to 32,\ntemperatures r from 0.2 to 1.6, and reference counts r from 4 to 40.

For example, with a batch\nsize of 32, ECLIPSE achieved an ASR of 0.97 on LLaMA2. The more candidate suffixes sampled in\none batch, the greater the probability of selecting effective jailbreaking suffixes, but this comes at the\ncost of rapidly increased GPU resource consumption.

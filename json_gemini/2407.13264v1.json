INTRODUCTION", "content": "UNDERWATER Underwater acoustic data are crucial for various applications [1], [2]. The efficient and intelligent processing of these data is vital for enhancing state-of-the-art underwater technologies. While numerous technologies have been developed specifically for terrestrial and aerial environments, the unique characteristics of the underwater environment make acoustic signals particularly effective for capturing its conditions. However, severe noise interference presents significant challenges to receivers in underwater communications [3]\u2013[5]. The complex underwater settings, unpredictable transmission channels, and varying motion states significantly affect real-world underwater acoustic signals (UAS), potentially obscuring the inherent features of targets [6]\u2013[8].\nConsequently, developing advanced technologies for UAS denoising has become a critical and burgeoning research area in underwater scenarios. Since the UAS contains intensive noise, extracting noise-resistant features is essential for underwater recognition tasks [9]. The UAS denoising can be categorized into four groups: Conventional approaches, decomposition-based framework, deep learning (DL) algorithm, and hybrid schemes. The overall framework of UAS denoising is shown in Figure 1. Conventional frameworks employ handcrafted statistical measurements to obtain the feature set, which is utilized to train the learning-based recognition model [9]. For instance, two recognition models based on neural networks are trained using eighty-eight features computed from the UAS [9]. Although these handcrafted features are interpretable, they may not effectively capture the high-level abstractions in underwater data that are essential for tasks involving complex patterns. Moreover, defining suitable handcrafted features for specific tasks requires extensive domain knowledge and offers limited flexibility.\nInspired by the 'divide and conquer' strategy, the UAS denoising community has explored the decomposition of complex UAS into simpler components, which are then individually or collectively denoised. The family of signal decomposition algorithms in UAS denoising is extensive, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [10], variational mode decomposition (VMD) [11], discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [12], empirical wavelet transform (EWT) [13], and their advanced variants [14]. Following decomposition, criteria are established and applied to classify components into signal-dominated, noise-dominated, and pure noise groups. Specific processing or denoising techniques are then tailored to each category. Noise components are discarded, while signal components are preserved. The final step involves the aggregation of these processed components to produce a denoised UAS.\nIn recent years, DL algorithms have succeeded across various fields due to their robust representation capabilities and minimal assumptions about the input data [15]. The feature extraction prowess of DL algorithms has prompted researchers to explore their effectiveness in UAS denoising [16]\u2013[19]. DL-based frameworks for UAS denoising typically utilize different neural network architectures to reconstruct clean signals from noisy inputs and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These models often employ an autoencoder architecture. The design of an efficient DL-based UAS denoising model depends on the choice of architectures and loss functions. The advantages of DL-based techniques include their consistency in denoising and applicability to subsequent tasks such as recognition or analysis based on UAS. Thus, the denoising process is task-oriented, aiming to ensure satisfactory performance across these applications.\nThe underwater data mining and signal process community has been dedicated to imagery data [20]\u2013[22], but much less effort on acoustic data. Although there are some reviews about underwater sensing, they neglect a crucial role of UAS denoising [23]\u2013[25]. Meanwhile, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art UAS denoising research needs to be conducted. This article comprehensively reviews recent advances in UAS denoising and contributes to the literature from the following perspectives:\n1 Despite the extensive research on UAS denoising algorithms, a comprehensive review systematically summa-\nrizing and discussing these diverse approaches is absent. This deficiency poses a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners aiming to thoroughly understand the landscape of UAS denoising techniques.\n2 We systematically analyze UAS denoising algorithms, from conventional signal processing methods to advanced DL algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a taxonomy of UAS denoising techniques, marking the first instance of such classification in the literature. This taxonomy meticulously delineates the current landscape of UAS research, revealing insightful connections among each category.\n3 We outline the prevailing challenges encountered in UAS denoising and explore potential solutions. Spanning from methodological intricacies to real-world applications, these challenges offer valuable insights and point towards promising avenues for future research in UAS denoising.\n4 We elucidate the diverse applications of UAS denoising techniques, underscoring their essential role in various underwater applications. This exploration holds significant interest for readers and practitioners alike, highlighting the critical importance of UAS denoising in underwater contexts."}, {"title": "II. OVERVIEW OF UAS DENOISING RESEARCH", "content": "This section first conducts a bibliometric analysis of the reviewed UAS denoising literature. Then, we discuss the unique challenges in denoising UAS data.\n\nA. Bibliometric Analysis\nThis survey reviews research in UAS denoising techniques, predominantly published in academic journals or conferences related to ocean engineering, measurement, signal processing, and artificial intelligence (AI). Notable venues include IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, Ocean Engineering, IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering, Applied Acoustics, Applied Ocean Research, Measurement, and The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. Figure 2 visualizes the scope of UAS denoising studies addressed in this survey.

Finally, Figure 2d displays the network graph of co-authorship within the UAS denoising literature, highlighting five collaborative communities and the extent of their interactions.\nB. Why UAS denoising is challenging\nThe low SNR of the UAS presents significant challenges; however, the complexities of the underwater environment introduce unique difficulties that distinguish UAS denoising from typical signal denoising tasks [4], [26]. Various noise sources exist in underwater environments, as shown in Figure 3. In underwater settings, the noise sources vary and include natural and anthropogenic elements. Natural sources such as marine life activity, wind-driven waves, and precipitation contribute significantly to the background noise. On the other hand, anthropogenic sources include ship traffic, industrial activities, sonar systems, and other man activities, all adding complexity to the noise environment [27], [28]. These diverse noise sources necessitate specialized approaches in UAS denoising to effectively separate the signal from the noise, ensuring clarity and accuracy in data interpretation.\n1) Complex sources: In the underwater scenario, the noise sources contributing to the complexity of acoustic signals can be broadly categorized into natural, anthropogenic, and system-based sources, each adding layers of challenges to UAS denoising:\n1. Natural Noise Sources:\n\u2022 Biological Noise: This includes sounds from marine life, such as whales, dolphins, and fish [29]. These biological entities often produce sounds for communication, navi-gation, and foraging, which can overlap in frequency and time with the signals of interest.\n\u2022 Geophysical Noise: Phenomena such as wind, rain, and sea state contribute to background noise [30]. Turbulence caused by waves breaking on the surface and interactions between water and seabed during storms generates significant noise levels [31].\n\u2022 Thermal Noise: Caused by the random motion of water molecules, thermal noise is more prevalent in deeper and warmer waters and acts as a constant background noise across all frequencies [32].\n2. Anthropogenic Noise Sources:\n\u2022 Shipping Traffic: Noise from commercial and recreational vessels is a dominant noise source in many oceanic environments. The sound from engines, propellers, and hull movement is pervasive at various frequencies and intensities [33], [34].\n\u2022 Industrial Activities: Underwater construction, oil drilling, and other marine operations involve heavy machinery that emits substantial acoustic signals [35], [36].\n\u2022 Sonar and Naval Exercises: Active sonar systems used by the military and some commercial ships emit powerful sound pulses that can interfere with and mask natural acoustic signals [37].\n3. System-based Noise Sources:\n\u2022 Instrument Noise: Noise inherent to the recording devices, such as electronic noise from sensors and recording equipment, can affect the data quality [38].\n\u2022 Data Transmission Noise: In wireless underwater communication, signals can be corrupted by noise introduced during transmission, including reflections and refractions from the water's surface or the seabed.\nEach noise source interacts differently with the underwater environment, making it challenging to isolate and remove unwanted noise from valuable data. Effective denoising thus requires a deep understanding of both the characteristics of these noises and the acoustic properties of the environment. Advanced signal processing techniques, adaptive filtering, and machine learning models are typically employed to enhance the clarity and reliability of the extracted signals in such complex scenarios.\n2) Energy imbalance: In underwater environments, the fusion of multi-source signals frequently results in an im-balanced energy distribution within the captured acoustic data. This imbalance complicates the signal processing tasks, particularly the denoising of UAS. Factors such as varying signal intensities, overlapping frequency ranges, and sporadic or persistent noise sources further exacerbate the challenge. These complexities necessitate sophisticated denoising techniques that effectively distinguish between noise and actual acoustic signals of interest. Moreover, the dynamic nature of underwater environments, including changes in water density, temperature, and movement, adds additional layers of variability that denoising algorithms must account for. Consequently, improving the accuracy of UAS denoising involves addressing the imbalance in signal fusion and adapting to the inherently noisy and unpredictable underwater acoustic landscape.\n3) Disparate optimization objectives: Since UAS denoising is usually the first stage for underwater recognition tasks, recognition models must be developed. Most literature treats denoising and recognition as two independent stages [39]. When designing UAS denoising algorithms, researchers may not consider the requirements of recognition tasks. The denoising stage is unsupervised, and recognition labels are unavailable. The objectives of developing denoising and recognition models are different, challenges in unifying these two stages."}, {"title": "III. CONVENTIONAL METHODS", "content": "Conventional UAS denoising is usually based on hand-craft features [40] and linear filtering [41]. UAS is split into various barks denoised by wavelet thresholding algorithms [19]. Frame-Based Time-Scale Filters method is proposed to improve the standard wavelet soft-thresholding in reducing distortions in the joint time-frequency space [42]. A two-stage denoising framework consisting of adaptive window median filter and wavelet threshold optimization is designed to eliminate Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, respectively [43]. This article focuses on the most recent advancement in UAS denoising. For conventional signal processing and thresholding techniques, we suggest referring to these survey studies [44]\u2013[46]."}, {"title": "IV. SIGNAL DECOMPOSITION", "content": "Signal decomposition techniques can decompose complex signals into various components or modes, carrying information of different frequencies. Individual modes are easier to analyze, process, and denoise [47]. The general framework of decomposition-based denoising methods is shown in Fig. After obtaining modes with the help of decomposition, suitable denoising algorithms are applied to these modes. Finally, denoised modes are aggregated to reconstruct the input signal. The overall framework of decomposition-based UAS denoising is visualized in Fig. 4.\nA. Wavelet transform\n1) Theoretical development: Fourier transform (FT) has historically been the method of choice for spectral analysis until the advent of wavelet transform. The Fourier transform's limitations, particularly its inefficiencies in local time-frequency representation and its poor performance with non-stationary signals, have led to its replacement by wavelet transform. This newer method has subsequently demonstrated significant success in the analysis of time series data. DWT is calculated as Equation 1,\n\\(f(j, k) =< x(t), \\psi_{j,k}(t) >= \\int x(t),\\psi_{j,k}(t)dt,\\)\nwhere \\(\\psi_{j,k}(t) = 2^{j/2}\\psi(2^jt \u2013 k), j,k \\in Z\\) is the wavelet function in DWT. In a practical forecasting problem, signal x(t) and \\(\\psi_{j,k}(t)\\) are both discrete as t is the discrete time index. In reality, finite-length times series x(t) \\in L\u00b2(R) are all applicable to DWT.\nIn 1988, Daubechies first introduced the construction of a finite-support orthogonal wavelet named the db wavelet family. For a specific wavelet, there is a pair of scaling function $\\phi_{j,k}(t)$ and wavelet function $\\psi_{j,k}(t)$ for scale j.\nThe most important property for a scaling function and wavelet function to satisfy the multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is the dilation equation in Equation 2 and 3 based on which MRA is built. It indicates that the coarser basis $\\phi(t)$ with larger support is a weighted sum of the finer basis $\\phi(2t - k)$ with shorter support and \\{h_k, k \\in Z\\} is the weight.\n\\$\\phi(t) = \\sqrt{2} \\sum_{k\\in Z} h_k\\phi(2t \u2013 k)\\$\n\\$\\psi(t) = \\sqrt{2} \\sum_{k\\in Z} g_k\\phi(2t \u2013 k)\\$\nAs {$\\phi_{j,k}(t)$, k \u2208 Z} spans space of scale j (Vj), any function f;(t) in V; can be written as a linear combination of the orthogonal base {$\\phi_{j,k}(t)$, k \u2208 Z} as\n\\(f_j(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_j [k]\\phi_{j,k},\\)\nwhere cj [k] is the coefficient of a corresponding basis \\phi_{j,k}. Based on this representation and Equation 2, 3, the nestedness between space {Vj, j \u2208 Z} can be derived as Equation 5.\n\\(V_j \\subset V_{j+1} \\subset\u2026V_j, j < J\\)\nMoreover, the difference(residual) space of two adjacent spaces written as W; = Vj+1 - V; is spanned by wavelet functions $\\psi_{j,k}$, (k\u2208 Z) due to the orthogonality between $\\phi_{j,k}$ and $\\psi_{j,k}$ we can effortlessly know that W; | Vj.\nThe scale j of V; is contingent upon the selected wavelet, with different wavelet functions (bases) yielding distinct spaces. A fundamental principle of MRA dictates that the scaling function \\(\\phi_{j,k}\\) exhibits a diminishing support length as j increases, which enhances its resolution and vice versa. Employing MRA in time series analysis provides an effective means to decompose a high-resolution signal into its constituent components, such as the rough trend and various cyclic frequencies, by utilizing different wavelet bases (scaling functions) at various scales.\n2) WT-based UAS denoising: Classical wavelet threshold denoising techniques effectively suppress noise by leveraging thresholds derived from wavelet coefficients, thereby retaining stronger signals [48], [62], [63]. Thresholding within this context can be classified into hard, soft, and hybrid categories [48]. However, classical wavelet thresholding algorithms struggle with non-Gaussian, non-linear, and non-stationary noise types. Moreover, selecting an appropriate threshold remains a significant challenge. To overcome these issues, some researchers have proposed using the posterior probability distribution of wavelet coefficients obtained from the DWT as the threshold to eliminate non-dominant coefficients [52]. Additionally, integrating the lifting wavelet transform with soft thresholding has been investigated as a strategy to mitigate the shortcomings of the first-generation wavelet transform [57].\nB. Empirical wavelet transform\n1) Theoretical development: The EWT represents an automated approach in signal processing, underpinned by robust theoretical foundations for decomposing non-stationary time series data [64]. Contrasting with DWT and EMD [65], EWT conducts a meticulous analysis of time series in the Fourier domain subsequent to the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This technique involves the segmentation of the spectrum through data-driven band-pass filtering.\nIn the EWT, limited freedom is provided for selecting wavelets. The algorithm employs Littlewood-Paley and Meyer's wavelets because of the analytic accessibility of the Fourier domain's closed-form formulations [66]. We represent the normalized frequency as w \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. We utilize wn to represent the limits between the segments that are obtained from the Fourier support [0, \u03c0]. These band-pass filters' formulations are denoted using Equations 6 and 7\n\\(\\eta_{n} (\\omega)=\\begin{cases}cos[\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\beta(\\frac{1}{\\gamma \\omega_{n}}(|\\omega|-(1-\\gamma)\\omega_{n}))] &\\text{if }(1-\\gamma)\\omega_{n} \\leq |\\omega| \\leq (1+\\gamma)\\omega_{n}\\\\0 &\\text{otherwise,}\\end{cases}\\)\n\\$\\psi_{n}(\\omega)=\\begin{cases}1 &\\text{if }(1+\\gamma)\\omega_{n} \\leq |\\omega| \\leq (1-\\gamma)\\omega_{n+1}\\\\\\\\cos[\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\beta(\\frac{1}{\\gamma \\omega_{n+1}}((1+\\gamma)\\omega_{n+1}-|\\omega|))] &\\text{if }(1+\\gamma)\\omega_{n} \\leq |\\omega| \\leq (1-\\gamma)\\omega_{n+1}\\\\0 &\\text{otherwise,}\\end{cases}\\$\nwith a transitional band width parameter y satisfying \\(\\gamma < \\min_{n} \\frac{\\omega_{n+1}-\\omega_{n}}{\\omega_{n+1}+\\omega_{n}}\\). The most common function \u03b2(x) in Equations 6 and 7 are presented in Equation 8.\n\\$\\beta(x) = x^{2}(35 - 84x + 70x^{2} \u2013 20x^{3})\\$\nThis empowers the formulated empirical scaling and wavelet function {\\$\\phi_{1}(\\omega), {\\psi_{n}(\\omega)}=1\\} to be a tight frame of L2(R). It can be observed that {\\$\\phi_{1}(\\omega), {\\psi_{n}(\\omega)}=1\\} are used as band-pass filters centered at assorted center frequencies.\n2) EWT-based UAS denoising: Although EWT achieved tremendous success in other sequence tasks, the UAS community has not researched its denoising ability [47]. The EWT is employed to decompose the UAS into several sub-series and utilize the sub-series of highest energy to train a recognition model [61].\nC. Empirical mode decomposition\n1) Theoretical development: The EMD is a wholly data-driven approach for decomposing time-domain signals into distinct oscillatory modes and a residual component [10]. Each mode, defined as an Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF), must satisfy two specific criteria to be classified as such.\n1. The number of extremums in the oscillation and the number of zero crossings must equal or differ by at most one.\n2. The mean of the envelopes defined by the local maxima and the local minima shall equal zero.\nThe signal decomposed by EMD can be expressed as the sum of a finite number of IMFs and a residual value.\n\\(x(t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{k} IMF_m(t)+r_k(t),\\)\nwhere k is the IMF number and rk(t) is the final residual value.\nThe set of IMFs constitutes a complete, adaptive, and nearly orthogonal basis for the original signal. The algorithm for the iterative process of EMD is as follows:\n1) Find all the minima and maxima in x(t).\n2) Perform cubic spline interpolation of minima to obtain the lower envelope em(t) and that of maxima for upper envelope ex(t).\n3) Find the mean of the two envelopes using m(t) =\n\\frac{e_m(t)+e_i(t)}{2}.\n4) Subtract the mean from the signal as d(t) = x(t)-m(t).\n5) Applying the abovementioned factors, check whether d(t) is an IMF.\n6) If d(t) is not an IMF, iterate from step (2) to (5) considering input as d(t) to find the IMF.\n7) If d(t) is an IMF, find the residue r(t) = x(t) \u2013 d(t).\n8) If r(t) has greater than two extrema, i.e., one maximum and one minimum and a single zero crossing the stopping criterion not satisfied, iterate from step (2) to (5), considering r(t) as input to find the subsequent IMF.\n9) If r(t) has less than or equal to 2 extrema, i.e., one maximum, one minimum, and a single zero-crossing, the stopping criterion is satisfied, r(t) is the final residue, and the EMD process is complete.\nThe EMD method preserves the signal in the time domain. Each IMF encapsulates information on the variations in amplitude and frequency of the original signal over time. IMFS consist of a single or a narrow band of frequencies with no overlap. Furthermore, these functions or signals are orthogonal to the original signal [67].\n2) EMD-based UAS denoising: EMD and its variants have achieved tremendous success in UAS denoising [51], [68], [69]. The application of the EMD technique offers a novel approach to detecting and classifying marine mammal vocal-izations in underwater acoustics, which traditionally requires extensive manual analysis by skilled acousticians. This method efficiently identifies and labels sound sources in a recording without prior knowledge or extensive pre-processing, streamlining the task through minimal post-processing quality control [70]. The non-stationarity of each decomposition mode is utilized to select noise components obtained by the ensemble EMD (EEMD) [71].\nThe CEEMD is employed to denoise the original signal first, and a bidirectional denoising autoencoder is developed to learn robust representations [72]. The complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive selective noise (CEEMDAN) is adopted to decompose UAS into IMFs, and IMF with the minimum difference between the energy distribution ratio and average energy distribution ratio is selected [73]. While decomposing the acoustic target signal, the correlation coefficient between each IMF and the original signal is utilized as a threshold to determine signal-dominated IMFs. In addition to utilizing threshold to drop out noisy IMFs, the literature also employs denoising algorithms to denoise noisy IMFs [58]. A criterion determining noisy IMFs is designed, and then noisy IMFs are denoised. Different criterion is proposed in the literature, such as minimum mean square variance [58], energy concentration property [74]. For denoising IMFs, researchers have tried on least mean square filter [58].\nModified uniform EMD is employed to decompose the input into IMFs, and a double threshold is obtained according to hierarchical amplitude-aware permutation entropy (PE). The threshold assists in dividing IMFs into clean, mixed, and noisy IMFs. Since mixed IMFs contain noisy information, an evolutionary improved wavelet threshold denoising method denoises mixed IMFs [49].\nRecently, secondary decomposition outperforms one-time approaches [53], [75]. Implementing a secondary decomposition assists in extracting high-level features and further denoising IMFs containing indistinguishable noise [76]. VMD decomposes signals denoised by wavelet thresholding further [52]. Then, the IMFs of high mutual information are selected for the following recognition tasks. Adaptive chirp mode decomposition, an advanced extension of EMD, is recently explored in [77].\nD. Variational mode decomposition\n1) Theoretical development: VMD can decompose the non-stationary signals into several sub-series called modes [11]. The VMD can be considered as the following problem\n\\$\\min _{ \\{m_{k}\\}, \\{\\omega_{k}\\} }\\left\\{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\left\\|\\partial_{t}\\left[\\left(\\delta(t)+x_{m j}(t)\\right) e^{k \\omega_{k} t}\\right]\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right\\}\\$\nwith the constraints as\n\\$\\sum_{k=1}^{K} m_{k} = x(t),\\$\nwhere mk is mode k, wk is mk's central frequency, K is the number of modes, x(t) represents the input time series. The problem shown in Equation 10 is transformed into Equation 12 when introducing the L2 penalty and Lagrange multiplier\n\\$\\mathcal{L}(\\{m_{k}\\}, \\{\\omega_{k}\\}, \\lambda)=\\alpha\\left\\{\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left\\|\\partial_{t}\\left[\\left(\\delta(t)+x_{m j}(t)\\right) e^{k \\omega_{k} t}\\right]\\right\\|_{2}^{2}\\right\\}+\\\\+\\left\\|x(t)-\\sum_{k=1}^{K} m_{k}\\right\\|+(x(t), x(t)-\\sum_{k=1}^{K} m_{k}\\$\nThe alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve the above problem in VMD. Then, the modes mk and wk are obtained during the shifting process. According to the ADMM algorithm, the mk and wk can be computed from the following equations,\n\\$\\hat{m}_{k}^{n+1}(\\omega)=\\frac{\\hat{y}(\\omega)-\\sum_{i\\neq k} \\hat{m}_{k}(\\omega)+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\delta \\omega}{\\frac{1}{2+\\alpha(\\omega-\\omega_{k})^{2}}}\\$\n\\$\\omega_{n+1}=\\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\omega\\left|\\hat{m}_{j}(\\omega)\\right|^{2} d \\omega}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left|\\hat{m}_{j}(\\omega)\\right|^{2} d \\omega}\\$\nwhere n represents the number of iterations, \u0177(\u03c9), m\u3047(\u03c9), (w) and mr+1 represent the Fourier transform of x(t), mj(t), x(t) and mr+1, respectively.\n2) VMD-based UAS denoising: To overcome the theoretical limitations of EMD, [11] propose the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm with solid theoretical development. VMD has successfully handled noisy UAS [57], [60], [78]. For instance, [57] employ VMD to decompose the input signal. Then, the authors apply the Savitzky-Golay filter and Lift wavelet threshold (LWTD) algorithms to denoise low-frequency and high-frequency components, respectively. Finally, all components are aggregated for reconstruction. Another principle of denoising IMFs is to classify noise-dominated and signal-dominated IMFs. Different denoising algorithms can be applied to noise-dominated and signal-dominated IMFs [56]. For instance, wavelet-thresholding algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering are employed to denoise noise-dominated and signal-dominated IMFs, respectively [56]. Their results demonstrate the superiority of VMD over EMD for UAS denoising tasks.\nUnlike the above methods dividing IMFs into two groups (clean and noise, low-frequency and high-frequency), some studies divide IMFS into three groups, pure, mixed, and noisy signals for fine-gained denoising [49].\nE. Other decompositions\nThe improved symplectic geometry modal decomposition generates IMFs in [79]. Unlike most literature, which utilizes some criterion to group IMFs into clean signal and noisy parts, spectral clustering is employed to cluster IMFs into mixed and noise clusters. Finally, wavelet thresholding techniques filter out noise in mixed clusters. The authors employ intrinsic time-scale decomposition and correlation coefficients to denoise UAS data [80].\nF. Thresholding\nThresholding is a fundamental step in the decomposition-based denoising framework. It eliminates noisy information from all decomposed components based on a predefined threshold [49]. This technique comprises two main stages: threshold determination and the thresholding function application. The first stage, threshold determination, primarily involves calculating threshold values using an appropriate criterion. The second stage, the thresholding function, is concerned with removing noise components while preserving the significant signal elements according to the established threshold.\n1) Threshold determination: When decomposing signals, distinguishing between meaningful components and noise is crucial. Noise components typically have little to no informational overlap with the original signal. The first stage of thresholding is to determine the threshold value. A good threshold value should assist in retaining signal-dominated information and eliminating noise as much as possible. Researchers have utilized a variety of criteria to compute the threshold value. For instance, correlation coefficients between IMFs and original signals are employed to determine the threshold [81]. Signal-dominated components should show a much higher correlation than noise-dominated components. However, correlation coefficients cannot measure the non-linear dependency between decomposed components and original UAS, which is essential in complex signal environments.\nIn addition to linear criterion, the entropy is an essential indicator to reflect information in each IMF [82]. Hence, the literature has explored various entropy-based metrics to compute the threshold, such as permutation entropy (PE) [83]\u2013[87], amplitude-aware PE [49], [82], dispersion entropy (DE) [58], [59], [88], fluctuation-based DE [78], [89], slope entropy [86], weighted PE[90], neural network estimation time entropy [55].\nMutual information quantifies the amount of information obtained about one random variable through another random variable. In the context of signals, it measures how much information the presence of one signal can tell about another signal. This is particularly useful when determining how much of one signal (such as the original) is present in another (like a decomposed signal component). Mutual information [83].\nIn addition to the above thresholding technique based on single-threshold, dual thresholds are researched in the literature [59]. For instance, an interval thresholding is employed in [59].\n2) Thresholding function: Thresholding functions aim at eliminating noisy components while retaining strong signals. Table II summarizes basic thresholding functions and baselines for advanced thresholding functions in the literature [48]. For instance, in [43], a new adaptive thresholding function considering the continuity of input-output curves, and is defined as:\n\\[w_{j,k} =\\begin{cases}sgn(w_{j,k}) \\left(|W_{j,k}| - |W_{j,k}|^{\\alpha}\\left(d_j \u2013 [W_{j,k}|\\right) * d_j\\right), & W_{j,k} \\geq A_j \\\\\\ 0, & W_{j,k} < A_j.\\end{cases}\\]\nAlthough advanced adaptive or semi-soft thresholding functions have been proposed and demonstrated outstanding performance, they often necessitate the optimization of additional hyper-parameters. This requirement can complicate their practical implementation and demand extensive computational resources or domain expertise to achieve optimal results. Such complexities can be a barrier, especially in applications with critical real-time processing or limited computational resources. Moreover, tuning these hyper-parameters can be sensitive to the specific characteristics of the data, making these methods less robust across diverse datasets unless carefully adjusted.\nG. Hyper-parameters of signal decomposition\nA practical issue of the decomposition-based denoising framework is determining the hyper-parameters of decomposition algorithms [52]. Signal decomposition algorithms share an essential hyper-parameter, the decomposition level. Smaller decomposition levels lead to significant mode mixing issues. However, high decomposition levels may generate components of fake frequencies and deteriorate the denoising performance. Meanwhile, each additional level of decomposition increases the computational burden.\nResearchers attempted to directly apply the decomposition level of EMD to VMD to retain the advantages of VMD while incorporating the adaptive capabilities of EMD [52]. Spearman correlation coefficients are utilized as a threshold to determine whether the decomposed component is unsubtle [56]. Measuring correlations between reconstructed and original UAS can also guide the selection of decomposition level [91]. Evolutionary optimization successfully determines hyperparameters of signal decomposition algorithms in the UAS denoising literature [81]. Researchers employ various evolutionary algorithms to search for threshold, decomposition, and other crucial parameters [43]."}, {"title": "V.

The core allure of these mod-\nels stems from their extraordinary capabilities in\nlanguage processing. Language, as a unique crys-\ntallization of human intelligence, serves not only\nas the external reflection of thought but also as\nthe bridge for communication, the cornerstone for\nthe dissemination of knowledge, and the continua-\ntion of civilization, profoundly shaping the identity\nof humans as a unique species. Thus, endowing\nmachines with the ability to understand and gen-\nerate language marks a significant leap towards\nthe realization of true artificial intelligence. The\nemergence of models such as the ChatGPT (Rad-\nford and Narasimhan, 2018; Brown et al., 2020;\nAchiam et al., 2023), the Llama (Touvron et al.,\n2023), and the PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023)\nvividly demonstrates this point.\nA distinctive feature of LLMs is their immense\nparameter size (Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al.,\n2023; Chowdhery et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021;\nZeng et al., 2022), often amounting to hundreds\nof billions or even trillions (for instance, GPT-\n3's (Brown et al., 2020) 175 billion parameters\nand PaLM's (Chowdhery et al., 2023) 540 bil-\nlion parameters). This vast parameter scale lays\nthe foundation for their exceptional language pro-\ncessing capabilities and enables them to exhibit\nalmost human-like traits, such as ICL (Brown\net al., 2020; Dong et al., 2022), instruction fol-\nlowing (Sanh et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei\net al., 2021), and multi-step reasoning (Wei et al.,\n2022). Notably, these colossal models are predomi-\nnantly trained by tech giants like Google and Mi-\ncrosoft using large-scale GPU clusters (Zhao et al.,\n2023), sparking a research fervor on how to effi-\nciently fine-tune them with limited GPU resources.\nThe advent of Lora (Hu et al., 2021) fine-tuning\ntechnology has provided an effective pathway for\nthis, allowing for the fine-tuning of large models un-\nder resource constraints without the need to adjust\nall parameters of the original model comprehen-\nsively. Moreover, model pruning techniques (Sun\net al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023) are crucial for de-\nploying large models in resource-constrained en-\nvironments, aiming to reduce the model size for\noperation on smaller devices. Faced with the chal-\nlenge of processing long texts, such as generating\nsummaries or answering questions based on ex-\ntensive documents\u2014which traditionally requires\nsubstantial computational resources\u2014technologies\nlike LongLora (Chen et al., 2023) have been devel-\noped to tackle the difficulties of processing long\ncontextual texts, further expanding the application\nboundaries of LLMs. Today, LLMs possess a di-\nverse range of functionalities, from translation and\ntext summarization to automatic code generation,\ndemonstrating their versatility.\nDespite LLMs being on a fast track of devel-\nopment towards higher intelligence and reliability,\nthe theoretical foundation behind them remains\nlargely unexplored, shrouded in clouds of uncer-\ntainty. The scientific community is actively seek-\ning to uncover the inner mechanisms behind their\npowerful capabilities, including analyses of ICL\nmechanism (Xie et al., 2021; Min et al., 2022),\namong others. Against this backdrop, we estab-\nlish the UAT (Cybenko, 2007; Hornik et al., 1989)\nas the mathematical essence of LLMS, and utilize\nthe UAT lens to clarify pivotal technologies and\nphenomena within contemporary LLMs, aiming\nto illuminate this central theoretical conundrum\nfrom a fresh perspective. Our contributions are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 We prove that the Transformer is the tangible\nembodiment of UAT.\n\u2022 We deliver a rigorous scientific explanation of\nTransformer-based LLMs through the UAT.\n\u2022 We explain the characteristics of LLMs, such\nas ICL, instruction following, multi-step rea-\nsoning, and the technologies applied within\nLLMs like Lora, pruning, and LLMs' strong\ngeneralization capabilities.\n\u2022 We offer insights into the future development\nof LLMs.\nOur article is structured as follows: In Section 2, we\nbegin by introducing the UAT and propose that to\ndemonstrate the Transformer's adherence to UAT,\nit is necessary to show that both Linear and Multi-\nHead Attention (MHA) can be represented in the\nform of matrix-vector multiplication. In Section\n3, we establish that the Transformer belongs to the\ncategory of UAT. Our proof strategy unfolds start-\ning with Section 3.1, where we present the idea to\nexpress Linear and MHA as matrix-vector prod-\nucts. In Section 3.2, we detail the computational\nmethods required for the proof. Sections 3.3 and\n3.4 are dedicated to proving that both Linear and\nMHA can indeed be represented as matrix-vector\noperations. Further in Section 4, we leverage UAT\nto theoretically elucidate some fundamental issues\n(Generalization 4.1, ICL 4.2) and techniques (Prun-\ning 4.3 and LoRA 4.4) associated with LLMs. Fi-\nnally, we conclude with a summary of the existing\nchallenges and potential future developments for\nLLMs in Section 4.5."}, {"title": "2 The Universal Approximation Theory", "content": "Up to now, the UAT (Cybenko, 2007) is the\nmost widely recognized fundamental theory in\ndeep learning. However, this theorem is only ap-\nplicable to the simplest form of neural networks,\nthe multilayer perceptron (MLP) (Cybenko, 2007;\nPopescu et al., 2009). Due to the increased com-\nplexity of Transformer networks, they cannot be\nmathematically expressed in the same form as UAT.\nThus, the theory has not yet been extended to Trans-\nformer networks. Our aim in this paper is to unify\nTransformer networks under the framework of UAT,\nthereby standardising their mathematical represen-\ntation. Before unifying their mathematical forms,\nwe provide a brief overview of the theorem, which\nwas initially proposed by Cybenko (2007). This\ntheorem encompasses numerous conclusions and\nproof details. Although it has been further devel-\noped, its fundamental mathematical form remains\nunchanged. Therefore, this paper explains the the-\nory based on the UAT form presented by Cybenko\n(2007). Theorem 2 from Cybenko (2007) states\nthat if \u03c3 is any continuous sigmoidal function, then\nfinite sums of the following form:\n$$G(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \u03b1_j \u03c3(W_j^T x + \u03b8_j)$$\n(1)\nis dense in C (In).

(1989)\nfurther demonstrates that multilayer feedforward\nnetworks also conform to the UAT, capable of ap-\nproximating arbitrary Borel measurable functions.\nObserving Equation (1), where the function G(x)\nyields a scalar output in R, the scenario expands\nnaturally when G(x) maps to Rm, requiring the ap-\nproximation in each dimension. It becomes evident\nthat to accommodate this multidimensional output,\na simple extension to Equation (1) suffices: the\ntransformation matrix Wj is revised to the space\nRn\u00d7m, the bias term \u03b8j is recast as a vector in Rm,\nand \u03b1j is reshaped into a diagonal vector.

While\nUAT possesses immense function approximation\nabilities, it inherently lacks the capacity of approx-\nimating multiple functions simultaneously. How-\never, language tasks are by nature diverse, poten-\ntially requiring the approximation of different func-\ntions based on the input. For instance, summariz-\ning, translating, and continuing the same text con-\ntent, the function space remains entirely the same\nexcept for minor variations in prompt words. With-\nout the ability to dynamically approximate func-\ntions based on input, but merely fitting based on a\ngeneral function trend, it would lead to approximat-\ning the same function, hence producing identical\nor similar output.

A legitimate question to ask is why LLMs\nare amenable to pruning?

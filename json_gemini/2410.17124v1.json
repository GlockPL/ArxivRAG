Stroke is the second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and dementia.

Introduction", "content": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally (Feigin et al., 2021), with 6.5 million deaths resulting from 12.2 million annual reported occurrences (Feigin et al., 2022). Given the high morbidity of stroke, with almost 50% of sufferers being left disabled, prevention is of paramount importance. Epidemiological studies have identified several risk factors for stroke, most of which are modifiable. Amongst them are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, cardiovascular diseases, and smoking (Donkor et al., 2018), all which have been associated with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) markers identifiable through different medical imaging modalities. CVD markers include ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), haemorrhagic stroke lesions, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), brain aneurysms (BA), and brain atrophy. In turn, previous stroke or the presence of CVD markers have been linked with increased risk of future stroke (Arboix, 2015; Debette and Markus, 2010), while CVD markers have also been associated with dementia (Tanabe, 2011).

CVD markers and imaging modalities", "content": "Some CVD markers were more heavily targeted than others: we see in Fig 3a that 11/13 publications dealt with WMH, 9/13 with ISL, 2/13 with PVS, 2/13 with lacunes, and 1/13 with CMB. 3 papers aimed to segment WMH in the presence of ISL (without attempting to segment ISL) (Shi et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2020a). Fig 3b shows the co-occurrence of targeted CVD markers within the identified publications. This reveals that the only CVD markers which are targeted jointly more than once are WMH and ISL.\nIn terms of imaging modalities, Fig 3d shows the number of uses of each MRI sequence type to identify (or identify confounders of) each CVD feature. Of the 13 papers, 11 used at least 2 sequences. The only paper to tackle CMB segmentation (Duan et al., 2020) used T2*, which is essential for identifying these very small bleeds. For tackling PVS, both papers (Uchiyama et al., 2008; Sudre et al., 2019) used T1 and T2 while the latter additionally used FLAIR. For tackling ISL, the most popular sequences were T1, FLAIR and DWI, with 2 papers also utilising T2. 3 papers exclusively use DWI for ISL identification (Shi et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Duan et al., 2020). For tackling lacunes, both Sudre et al. (2019) and Duan et al. (2020) used T1 and FLAIR, with the former also using T2. For tackling WMH, all papers use FLAIR with some additionally using T1. Overall, FLAIR was used the most times to identify a CVD marker, with 22 usages, T1 was used 14 times, T2 was used 6 times, DWI was used 5 times and T2* and T1-FLAIR were each used only once."}, {"title": "3.3.2.

Preprocessing", "content": "To handle the variation in appearance between scans acquired from different scanners, different imaging protocols, and different subjects, some pre-processing is usually performed to normalise the data before running the core image analysis detection/segmentation algorithm. In machine learning, preprocessing is easily defined: it comprises the steps taken before inputs are passed into the machine learning model. These steps should be performed in the same way for the training and testing data. For analytical methods which rely entirely on rules-based processing, it can be more difficult to identify where preprocessing ends and the algorithm begins. In this review, we consider preprocessing to be conventional steps which could feasibly be applied prior to any image processing algorithm, such as registration to a standard template, or normalisation. We consider, for example, more complex tasks like unsupervised brain tissue segmentation as part of the method, not the preprocessing.\nLiu et al. (2020a), Liu et al. (2020b), and Llambias et al. (2024) use publicly available datasets, without applying any further preprocessing. We now describe the preprocessing steps taken in the remaining 9 publications (Uchiyama et al. (2008) do not mention preprocessing), making use of non-open source data.\nBias field correction. Bias field correction was applied by 4/9 papers (Wang et al., 2012; Sudre et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Phitidis et al., 2023). Wang et al. (2012) specified the method as non-parametric non-uniform intensity normalisation (Sled et al., 1998) and Liu et al. (2022) used a variant proposed in Tustison et al. (2010).\nCoregistration. Coregistration of multiple sequences is stated by 5/9 (Wang et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Guerrero et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022). Of these 5 papers, 2 (Wang et al., 2012; Guerrero et al., 2018) specify the use of FSL-FLIRT4 (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002) as the software used to perform affine registration. Additionally, 1 paper specifies the transformation as affine (Shi et al., 2013) and 1 specifies rigid (Tsai et al., 2014). It should be noted that rigid transformation is a subset of affine transformation for which scaling and shearing is not allowed. The cost function is specified as normalised mutual information (Maes et al., 1997) by"}, {"title": "3.3.4.

They extracted features"}, {"title": "3.3.5. Deep learning methods", "content": "A summary of the design choices made by the methods that used DL can be seen in Table 2. Some common themes are the use of CNNs, cross-entropy or Dice loss, batch normalisation, and the ReLu activation function. The following studies used DL:\nGuerrero et al. (2018). The authors implemented a 2D CNN based on the successful U-Net architecture (Ronneberger et al., 2015), which they termed uResNet. Their main enhancement of the standard U-Net model was introducing residual connections (He et al., 2016) within each layer.\nSudre et al. (2019). A 3D model based on RCNN (Girshick et al., 2014) was developed by the authors to detect lacunes and PVS. They do not resize or pool the selected bounding box regions as is done in the original framework, since the target objects (lacunes and PVS) are small making them prone to distortion during resizing, likely leading to worse model performance. Their model attempts to classify each region as nothing, lacune, PVS, or either lacune or PVS.\nDuan et al. (2020). The authors used 4 independently trained 2D U-Nets to segment WMH, lacunes, infarcts, and microbleeds from different sequences as detailed in Table 4.\nLiu et al. (2020a). The authors developed a 2D CNN method which they coined M2DCNN. The model utilised 2 symmetric U-Net-like networks at different resolutions to extract multi-scale features. At the encoder-decoder bottlenecks they employed dilated convolutions with a stride of 1 to enlarge the receptive field size whilst maintaining the same feature map dimensions. They also replaced the standard convolution blocks with dense blocks (Huang et al., 2017)."}, {"title": "3.3.6.

Conclusion", "content": "There is at this time no comprehensive, fully automated and well validated neuroradiological support system for all non-acute CVD findings (ISL, WMH, PVS, CMB, lacunes, and atrophy). We propose that such a system would provide a great benefit to society, as CVD is a leading cause of dementia and stroke, and automatic quantification of all of these features would open the door for more large-scale research and more efficient patient management. This could build on the success of acute stroke detection systems which are currently being utilised in several hospitals around the world with a reportedly positive impact on patient care, and software used in clinics to automate the arduous manual process of brain volume estimation and WMH segmentation.\nThe recent advancements in DL hold promise for the future of automatic evaluation of CVD markers. Further methodological innovations in the areas of data-efficient learning and small lesion segmentation, as well as an increase in the availability of standardised benchmark datasets and metrics (using best practices agreed by the research community (Maier-Hein et al., 2024; Reinke et al., 2024)), will likely be required before development of a complete and robust system is feasible."}, {"title": "CRediT authorship contribution statement", "content": "Jesse Phitidis: Conceptualization, Methodology, Data curation, Writing - original draft.

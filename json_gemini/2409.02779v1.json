To inform the design of such agreements and institutions, we conducted case studies of historical and contemporary international security agreements. We focused specifically on those arrangements around dual-use technologies, examining agreements in nuclear security, chemical weapons, biosecurity, and export controls. For each agreement, we examined four key areas: (a) purpose, (b) core powers, (c) governance structure, and (d) instances of non-compliance. From these case studies, we extracted lessons for the design of international AI agreements and governance institutions. We discuss the importance of robust verification methods, strategies for balancing power between nations, mechanisms for adapting to rapid technological change, approaches to managing trade-offs between transparency and security, incentives for participation, and effective enforcement mechanisms.", "sections": [{"title": "Executive Summary", "content": "We examine 5 international security agreements focusing on dual-use technologies and extract lessons for potential AI governance efforts. The following table summarizes the 5 case studies:\nCase Study Summaries\nIAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)\n\u2022 Purpose: Promote peaceful nuclear energy, prevent nuclear proliferation, and verify compliance with the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\u2022 Core Powers: Inspect facilities, verify non-proliferation, and report violations to the UN Security Council.\n\u2022 Governance: The Board of Governors has 35 members 13 are pre-selected based on nuclear capability, and 22 are elected by the General Conference for two years. The Director General is chosen by the Board and approved by the General Conference.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance: Iran's illegal nuclear program was discovered in 2002, leading to sanctions and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The deal's effectiveness was questioned and undermined when the US withdrew.\nSTART Treaties\n\u2022 Purpose: Reduce US and Russian nuclear arsenals.\n\u2022 Core Powers: Allow on-site inspections, satellite monitoring, and data exchange.\n\u2022 Governance: Overseen by the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC) with US and Russian officials; decisions are made by consensus.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance: In 2023, Russia stopped allowing inspections.\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)\n\u2022 Purpose: Eliminate the production and use of chemical weapons and verify compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n\u2022 Core Powers: The OPCW conducts inspections and oversees the elimination of chemical destruction.\n\u2022 Governance: The Conference of the States Parties elects a 41-member Executive Council (EC) to the OPCW. The Director-General manages daily operations.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance: Syria used chemical weapons and failed to comply with OPCW inspections, leading to suspension from certain rights and privileges afforded by the CWC.\nWassenaar Arrangement\n\u2022 Purpose: Promote transparency in the exports of arms and dual-use technologies & generate consensus.\n\u2022 Core Powers: Coordinate arms control policies and share best practices.\n\u2022 Governance: Decisions are made by consensus at annual meetings. Discussions are facilitated through working groups for technical matters and policy decisions.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance: Russia has been accused of undermining and violating the Wassenaar Arrangement by unilaterally blocking attempts to update export control lists.\nBiological Weapons Convention (BWC)\n\u2022 Purpose: Eliminate the production and use of biological weapons.\n\u2022 Core Powers: The BWC relies on commitments by member states and voluntary information-sharing mechanisms between nations (rather than a centralized body like the IAEA or the OPCW).\n\u2022 Governance: Decision-making is decentralized. States conduct Review Conferences to discuss new scientific developments. States address potential violations through consultation and cooperation; there is no formal process for inspections or verification.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance: The Soviet Union secretly developed biological weapons until exposed by defectors. The BWC failed to detect this violation, exposing potential weaknesses in the BWC relating to lack of verification and an over-reliance on self-reporting."}, {"title": "Key Findings and Lessons Learned", "content": "1. Verification mechanisms are essential: Robust inspection and monitoring powers have been vital for\ninstitutions like the IAEA and OPCW, while the lack of verification in the BWC has undermined its effec-\ntiveness. Given AI's potential strategic value, effective verification will likely be a necessary foundation\nfor any international agreement.\n2. Governance structures attempt to distribute power based on geography and national capabilities:\nInternational agreements often provide extra power (e.g., some seats on the IAEA Board of Governors\nare reserved for nations with advanced nuclear programs) to nations with advanced capabilities while\nalso attempting to ensure geographic representatives (e.g., some seats on the IAEA Board of Governors\nare reserved for nations from certain geographical regions). Future AI governance structures will need\nto consider how to appropriately represent global interests while acknowledging the roles of leading AI\npowers.\n3. Agreements balance transparency and privacy. Greater transparency allows for more robust verifica-\ntion, though greater transparency could expose proprietary information or state secrets. The US rejected\na proposed BWC verification method due to concerns about proprietary information. For AI agreements,\nthe level of transparency nations are willing to allow will likely be proportional to the perceived risks.\n4. Agreements must adapt to technological change: The NEW START treaty and the BWC have had to\nadapt to novel technologies like hypersonic weapons or advances in synthetic biology. Rapid technolog-\nical advancement in AI may require governance structures that can adapt quickly. This emphasizes the\nimportance of strong technical expertise within governing bodies to track breakthroughs, anticipate risks,\nand develop appropriate regulatory responses.\n5. Agreements use benefit-sharing to incentivize participation. The OPCW provides member states with\nsupport for the peaceful uses of chemistry and the IAEA provides support for the peaceful use of nu-\nclear energy. International AI agreements may incentivize participation by sharing safe and responsible\napplications of AI technology."}, {"title": "Future work", "content": "These findings underscore the complexity of developing effective international AI governance mechanisms.

Al experts, policy experts, and world govern-\nments have acknowledged a variety of ways that advanced\nAI development could present major security challenges\n(Bengio et al. 2024; Roberts et al. 2023; Biden 2023). At\nthe UK AI Safety Summit, over 20 nations (including the\nUnited States and China) acknowledged risks from the in-\ntentional misuse or unintentional misalignment of advanced\nAI systems. Furthermore, they acknowledged that \"[m]any\nrisks arising from AI are inherently international in nature,\nand so are best addressed through international cooperation\"\n(Bletchley Declaration 2023).\nInternational coordination may have the potential to re-\nduce global security risks. Thus far, international coordina-\ntion has focused on defining risks and establishing volun-\ntary standards for safe AI development. Many countries have\nlaunched AI Safety Institutes designed to measure risks from\nadvanced AI, further the science of AI evaluations and risk\nmanagement, share research about AI safety, and work to-\nward a common understanding of risks and risk mitigation\nstrategies (UK Government 2024). The US AI Safety Insti-\ntute announced that it plans to lead an \"inclusive, interna-\ntional network on the science of AI safety\" (NIST 2024),\nand international dialogues have emphasized the need for\n\"coordinated global action on AI safety research and gover-\nnance\" (IDAIS 2023; NIST 2024). Furthermore, while it is\ntoo early to tell how China will react to international coor-\ndination proposals, there are early signs that Chinese lead-\ners acknowledge global security risks from advanced AI and\ncould be interested in international approaches to AI gover-\nnance (Wasil et al. 2024a).\nPrevious work has examined proposals for international\nAI agreements. Such agreements focus on various aims,\nincluding consensus-building, enforcement of regulations,\nemergency preparedness and response, and the shared dis-\ntribution of benefits from AI (Maas and Villalobos 2023).\nSome scholars have described an international approach to\nadvanced Al development, in which certain kinds of ad-\nvanced AI development take place in a joint safety-focused\nAI project (Cass-Beggs et al. 2024; Hausenloy, Miotti, and\nDennis 2023; Ho et al. 2023). Another common proposal in-\nvolves the creation of international institutions that set stan-\ndards, monitor compliance with standards, detect unautho-\nrized AI development, or certify national regulatory bodies\n(Ho et al. 2023; Trager et al. 2023).\nInternational proposals for AI governance could be in-\nformed by existing international agreements and interna-\ntional institutions. There are many historical and modern\ncase studies of international agreements or institutions that\nattempt to minimize global risks (United Nations 1945; Fis-\ncher 1997; Goldblat 1997; Croddy, Perez-Armendariz, and\nHart 2002; Thakur and Haru 2007; Schabas 2011; Woolf\n2011; Lipson 2017). In this paper, we review international\nagreements which focus on dual-use technologies. These\nagreements are especially relevant to AI given its dual-use\npotential (Pedersen 2023; National Telecommunications and\nInformation Administration 2024). Our aim is to identify\nlessons learned that could inform the design of future inter-"}, {"title": "Case studies of international agreements", "content": "national agreements or international institutions designed to\nreduce global risks from advanced AI. The paper is divided\ninto two sections:\n1. Case studies. We cover the following questions for each\ninternational agreement:\n(a) Purpose. What is the purpose of the agreement?\n(b) Core powers. What are the core powers granted to the\ninternational body responsible for monitoring and en-\nforcement?\n(c) Governance structure. How is the agreement gov-\nerned?

We summarize lessons learned that\ncould be useful when thinking about international agree-\nments related to the development or deployment of ad-\nvanced AI.\nCase studies of international agreements\nIAEA\nPurpose. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nwas founded in 1957 to promote the peaceful use of nu-\nclear energy and limit its use for military purposes (Gold-\nschmidt 1977). The IAEA exists as an autonomous organi-\nzation within the United Nations. In practice, one of its main\npurposes is to verify that states do not build nuclear weapons\n(Scheinman 2016).\nCore powers. The IAEA can conduct inspections to en-\nsure that states are not secretly building nuclear facilities.\nFindings from inspections are reported to the IAEA Board\nof Directors. If the Board of Directors believes that a state is\nnot complying with international agreements, the Board can\nescalate the issue to the UN Security Council (Rockwood\n2013).\nUltimately, the IAEA does not have the authority to take\naction directly - it simply provides information to the UN\nSecurity Council and member states (Rockwood 2013). The\nUN Security Council has the authority to impose sanctions\u00b9\n(e.g., trade restrictions, travel bans, freezing assets) or en-\ngage in military action.\nGovernance structure. The IAEA is composed of 178\nmember states (International Atomic Energy Agency 2024).\nThe selection of the Board of Governors and the Director\nGeneral are the most consequential parts of IAEA's gover-\nnance structure. The Board currently consists of 35 mem-\nbers; each member represents a different nation (Interna-\ntional Atomic Energy Agency 2023a). 13 of those spots\nare guaranteed to nations that have advanced atomic en-\nergy technology 22 are elected by the General Conference\nAfter the UN Security Council passes a resolution to issue a\nsanction, each member state is responsible for implementing the\nsanctions at the national level. Member states must report back to\nthe UN about their compliance and enforcement measures."}, {"title": "START Treaties", "content": "for a two-year term. The election attempts to ensure a bal-\nanced geographical representation from each region of the\nworld. The Director General of the IAEA is selected by the\nBoard. The Director General must receive a two-thirds ma-\njority from the Board, as well as approval from the General\nConference (International Atomic Energy Agency 2023b).\nThe Director General is responsible for setting the IAEA's\nstrategic direction, overseeing the development and imple-\nmentation of policies, managing the IAEA's staff, providing\nreports to the Board of Generals and General Conference,\nand directing the IAEA's emergency response protocols. The\nDirector General appoints many of the senior-level staff of\nthe IAEA and oversees the recruitment and training of IAEA\ninspectors (IAEA 2024; Fischer 1997).\nNon-compliance. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Iran\nbegan secretly investing in its nuclear program via the Amad\nPlan. In 2002, these efforts were publicly exposed by the Na-\ntional Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), a political or-\nganization that advocated for the collapse of the Islamic Re-\npublic and the establishment of a democratic, secular gov-\nernment (Nuclear Control Institute 2006). After the NCRI\nrevelations, the IAEA conducted inspections and found Iran\nto be in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty (Gerami and Goldschmidt 2012).\nThe IAEA reported Iran to the UN Security Council who\nthen recommended the application of diplomatic pressure\nand economic sanctions (Suzuki 2019). This led to a se-\nries of sanctions by the UN Security Council and a series\nof international negotiations with Iran. In 2015, this resulted\nin the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) an\nagreement between Iran and the P5+1 (US, UK, France,\nRussia, China, and Germany) (Abtahi 2014). The JCPOA\n(colloquially referred to as the \u201cIran Nuclear Deal\") required\nIran to limit its investments in its nuclear program and allow\nextensive monitoring and inspections by the IAEA. In ex-\nchange, economic sanctions on Iran would be lifted (Robin-\nson 2023).\nThe JCPOA went into effect in 2016, but the United States\nwithdrew from the agreement in 2018 (Fitzpatrick 2017).\nThe Trump Administration argued that the JCPOA did not\ngo far enough in restricting Iran's nuclear program, did not\nrestrict its ballistic missile program, and did not address\nits role in regional conflicts in the Middle East (Robinson"}, {"title": "The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)", "content": "2023). There were also concerns about the verification meth-\nods, with some critics of the deal arguing that Iran might\nstill be able to secretly invest in its nuclear program de-\nspite the increased monitoring. Ultimately, the United States\nended up reimposing sanctions on Iran. Iran initially con-\ntinued to comply with the agreement (as verified by IAEA\nreports) (Davenport 2019), but as the sanctions from the\nUnited States intensified, Iran began to reduce its compli-\nance with the JCPOA commitments (Tabatabai and Pease\n2019). IAEA inspections continued to occur (Adler 2024),\nand the JCPOA did not fully dissolve- many nations (in-\ncluding Russia and China) have continued to support it, and\nthere are ongoing efforts to bring the United States back into\nthe deal.\nSTART Treaties\nPurpose. The START treaties, or Strategic Arms Reduction\nTreaties, were a series of bilateral agreements between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union (later Russia) (Schenck\nand Youmans 2011). The primary goal of the various START\ntreaties is to reduce the number of strategic nuclear weapons\nand their delivery systems possessed by the United States\nand Russia (previously the Soviet Union). The treaties in-\nclude various verification and transparency mechanisms to\nprovide assurance to each nation that the other is meeting its\ncommitments. START I entered into force in 1994. START\nI was intended to be followed by START II, but START II\nnever entered into force due to disagreements between the\ntwo nations. SORT (Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty)\nsuccessfully entered into force in 2003, and was superseded\nby New Start in 2011 (Woolf 2011).\nCore powers. The original START I allowed nations to\nconduct inspections to ensure compliance, these included\nroutine inspections and short-notice inspections of suspect\nactivities (Woolf 2011). The nations also monitored each\nother primarily using satellites and agreed not to interfere\nwith each other's monitoring. START I also allowed for con-\ntinuous monitoring of certain facilities- inspectors from the\nother nation would maintain a 24/7 presence and inspect all\nvehicles and containers large enough to hold treaty-limited\nitems. The current New START treaty allows for similar\nmonitoring and verification by each nation. Unlike START\nI, New START does not include continuous on-site moni-\ntoring at missile production facilities, instead relying more\non periodic inspections and data exchanges (Woolf 2011).\nThis may be due to continuous monitoring being expensive\nto maintain, and the greater level of trust between the U.S.\nand Russia.\nGovernance structure. START I created the Joint Com-\npliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC), which was the\nprimary forum for addressing implementation issues and\nresolving questions related to compliance (Schenck and\nYoumans 2011). The JCIC was composed of representatives\nfrom both the US and the USSR (later Russia). These repre-\nsentatives included diplomats, military officials, and techni-\ncal experts. The JCIC met regularly, typically several times a\nyear, and could convene special sessions at the request of ei-\nther party. Decisions were made by consensus, and both par-"}, {"title": "Wassenaar Arrangement", "content": "ties had to agree on resolutions and interpretations. Proceed-\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons (OPCW)\nPurpose. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical\nWeapons (OPCW) is an autonomous international organiza-\ntion established to implement the Chemical Weapons Con-\nvention (CWC), a chemical weapons control treaty that went\ninto force in 1997 (OPCW 2024). The OPCW now over-\nsees 193 member states that have signed the CWC. Under\nOPCW verification, members of the CWC are prohibited\nfrom developing, producing, stockpiling, transferring, or us-\ning chemical weapons (except for limited uses such as med-\nical or research purposes) and are required to destroy any\nof their existing chemical weapons (Arms Control Associa-\ntion 2024). The OPCW was modeled after the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Dorn and Rolya 1993).\nCore powers. The OPCW has the authority to send in-\nspectors to any member state to search for evidence of the\nproduction of banned chemicals and verify compliance with\nthe CWC. OPCW conducts both routine inspections as well\nas investigations into allegations of CWC violations through\nFact-Finding Missions (FFM) and challenge inspections.\nThe organization also oversees and verifies the destruction\nof chemical weapons stockpiles and production facilities de-\nclared by member states.\nIf a Member State believes another state is non-compliant\nwith the CWC, it can request the Executive Council (EC)\nto launch a challenge inspection. The inspection can be\nlaunched at short notice within 12 hours of notification -\nand cannot be refused by the Member State. The Director-\nGeneral formally issues the challenge inspection.\nIf a State Party fails to address compliance issues, the\nConference may restrict or suspend its rights under the Con-\nvention. The Conference may also recommend collective\nmeasures, such as sanctions. For serious violations, the Con-\nference may recommend collective measures to States Par-\nties or bring the issue to the UN Security Council.\nAnother key power of the OPCW is to facilitate coopera-\ntion on safe chemistry research. While the CWC restricts the\nproduction of 'dual-use' chemicals, it encourages the peace-\nful uses of chemistry in industry, agriculture, and research\npurposes. The OPCW also offers training to specialists on\npractical aspects of chemical safety and provides forums to\nshare and discuss best practices among State Parties (Organ-\nisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 1997).\nGovernance structure. The Conference of the States Par-\nties (CSP) is the principal organ composed of all OPCW\nMember States. It meets annually to make key decisions,\nadopt the budget, and elect and direct the Executive Council\n(EC), and jointly appoint the Director-General with the EC.\nAlso, the States Parties nominate a group of emergency re-\nsponse experts to be part of the Protection Network, who are\ncalled in to assist and protect against chemical weapons.\nThe CWC mandates that each Member State establishes\na National Authority to facilitate communication with the\nOPCW and ensure national compliance through appropriate\nlegislation and enforcement measures.\nThe Executive Council (EC), with 41 CSP-elected States\nParties, oversees the day-to-day operation of OPCW, imple-"}, {"title": "Biological Weapons Convention", "content": "ings were confidential, and agreed outcomes were shared\nwith the relevant agencies of both countries. Both countries\nalso authorized national implementation bodies to oversee\nthe implementation of START I. The US body was the On-\nSite Inspection Agency (OSIA), which was originally cre-\nated in 1988 to implement the inspection regime for the\nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The OSIA\ntrained inspectors, organized inspections of Russian facili-\nties, and escorted Russian inspectors around US facilities.\nIn 1998 it was consolidated into the newly formed Defense\nThreat Reduction Agency, which continues to carry out sim-\nilar duties for New Start. New START replaced the JCIC\nwith the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC), which\nhas a similar function and is composed of representatives\nfrom the US and Russia (Woolf 2011). Decisions are again\nmade by consensus.\nNon-compliance. In January 2023, the U.S. State De-\npartment reported to Congress that Russia was in non-\ncompliance with the New START treaty. The report noted\nthat Russia had refused to reschedule inspections after their\nCOVID-19-related pause and had failed to meet for a ses-\nsion of the Bilateral Consultative Commission since Octo-\nber 2021. This marked the first formal U.S. accusation of\nRussian violation since the treaty's inception in 2011. (Pre-\nviously, there had been disputes with START I, although\nthese had been successfully resolved via diplomatic chan-\nnels and the JCIC.) Following this report, in February 2023,\nRussia announced the suspension of its participation in the\nNew START treaty. This action escalated the existing com-\npliance issues, as Russia had already halted on-site inspec-\ntions in August 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin cited\nWestern support for Ukraine as the primary reason for the\nsuspension. The move raised concerns about the future of\ndata exchanges and other verification measures required by\nthe treaty. In response, the US revoked visas to Russian in-\nspectors in June 2023. Despite the suspension, both coun-\ntries stated they would continue to adhere to the numerical\nlimits on nuclear warheads and delivery systems set by the\ntreaty. However, the lack of verification measures compli-\ncated the ability to confirm compliance. As of 2024, Russia\nhas rejected further talks, continuing to cite US support of\nUkraine. Without further negotiations, New START (along\nwith its verification measures) will expire in 2026.\nWassenaar Arrangement\nPurpose. The Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) was estab-\nlished in 1996 as a voluntary export control regime (Davis\n1996; Wassenaar Arrangement 2024). Its primary purpose\nis to promote transparency in exports of conventional arms\n(such as tanks and missiles) and dual-use technologies (such\nas radio equipment and lasers) and to prevent accumula-\ntions of these items from destabilizing international security\n(G\u00e4rtner 2008). It is the successor to the Coordinating Com-\nmittee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), a stricter\nagreement that was established during the Cold War and\nceased operation in 1994 (Schiavone 1997).\nCore powers. The Wassenaar Arrangement establishes\nregular information exchange and policy coordination, but\nit does not set up formal inspection or enforcement pow-\ners (G\u00e4rtner 2008). During the annual Plenary Meeting, all\nmember states send representatives to a headquarters build-\ning in Vienna, and they come to a consensus on two \"con-\ntrol lists\" the Munitions List and the List of Dual-Use\nGoods and Technologies which define items that they\nagree should be subject to export controls (Wassenaar Ar-\nrangement 2016). They also exchange information on trans-\nfers of these items and denials of certain export licenses.\nThe arrangement also maintains \"best practices\" docu-\nments on topics such as effective legislation on arms bro-\nkering and internal compliance programs for dual-use goods\nand technologies (Wassenaar Arrangement 2016). Each state\nretains its autonomy regarding whether or how it chooses to\nimplement these practices as a result, each state's imple-\nmentation of export controls differs in practice."}, {"title": "Lessons learned", "content": "Governance structure. All decisions, including the addi-\ntion of new members and the election of chairs, are made by\nconsensus (Wassenaar Arrangement Secretariat 2015). The\nagreement is open to adding new members if they produce\nor export relevant goods, they maintain membership in other\nnon-proliferation agreements, and they maintain fully effec-\ntive export controls (Li 2014).\nThe Plenary Committee is made up of representatives\nfrom all participating states and is headed by the Plenary\nChair, who facilitates discussions at the annual Plenary\nMeeting in the headquarters building in Vienna. During the\nmeeting, representatives provide information on transfers,\nrevise best practices documents and control list entries, es-\ntablish subsidiary \u201cworking groups\" to help make recom-\nmendations for decisions, and decide on which state should\nbe the Plenary Chair for the following year and who should\nlead each working group (Wassenaar Arrangement Secre-\ntariat 2015). The main working groups are currently the\nGeneral Working Group (GWG), which deals with policy-\nrelated matters, and the Experts Group (EG), which ad-\ndresses control lists. In addition, the Licensing and Enforce-\nment Officers Meeting (LEOM) is held once per year, and\na small group called the Secretariat provides administrative\nsupport and maintains the headquarters building.\nNon-compliance. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\nsome experts on non-proliferation have questioned whether\nRussia can remain in export control arrangements such as\nthe Wassenaar arrangement (James Martin Center for Non-\nproliferation Studies 2022). While their membership pro-\nvides the international community some insight into their\nexport activities, Russia has used its position to impede ef-\nforts to update control lists (Center for Arms Control and\nNon-Proliferation 2023) forcing other nations to implement\nad hoc export controls outside the arrangement's framework\n(The White House 2022). Moreover, Russia exports parts\nused in weapons manufacturing to unstable regions, specif-\nically North Korea (Herskovitz 2024). Some view Russia's\ninvolvement in Wassenaar as an opportunity for intelligence\ngathering instead of a genuine attempt to further the goals\nof the arrangement (Center for Arms Control and Non-\nProliferation 2023). Even if there were significant senti-\nment in favor of removing Russia from the Wassenaar ar-\nrangement, this wouldn't be feasible because some countries\nwould oppose it \u2014 all decisions are made by consensus\nand there is no formal expulsion mechanism.\nBiological Weapons Convention\nPurpose. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)\nprohibits the development, production, acquisition, trans-\nfer, stockpiling, and use of biological and toxin weapons\n(Kadlec, Zelicoff, and Vrtis 1997). It was the first multilat-\neral disarmament treaty to ban an entire category of weapons\nof mass destruction. The BWC was opened for signature on\nApril 10, 1972, and entered into force on March 26, 1975.\nIt built upon the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which had only pro-\nhibited the use of biological weapons in war. The BWC cur-\nrently has 187 state parties and four signatory states. The\ntreaty consists of 15 articles. Review Conferences are held\nevery five years to assess and strengthen the Convention's\nimplementation.\nCore powers. The BWC's core powers are primarily\nbased on commitments by member states and information-\nsharing mechanisms, rather than a strong centralized author-\nity. The Convention requires states to implement its provi-\nsions through national legislation and regulations. This in-\ncludes prohibiting the development, production, and stock-\npiling of biological weapons, as well as destroying or divert-\ning existing stockpiles to peaceful purposes.\nA key feature of the BWC is its system of Confidence"}, {"title": "Lessons learned", "content": "Building Measures (CBMs)", "identify and examine po-\ntential verification measures from a scientific and technical\nstandpoint\" (BWC 1991). Ultimately, however, these efforts\nwere unsuccessful, and the US rejected VEREX's proposed\nprotocol in 2001. Notably, the US's rejection was grounded\nin the concern that the new proposals would not provide suf-\nficient measures to effectively verify compliance with the\nprotocol (Huigang et al. 2022). In the words of US Ambas-\nsador Mahley, the proposals would \u201cstill permit a potential\nproliferator to conceal significant efforts in legitimately un-\ndeclared facilities\u201d (Whitehair and Brugger 2001).\ntween Review Conferences to discuss specific topics re-\nlated to the BWC's implementation.\n4. Implementation Support Unit (ISU)": "Established in 2006", "Governments": "The US", "UN-\nODA)": "Provides institutional support for the BWC, in-\ncluding hosting the ISU.\nThe BWC does not have a formal international organiza-\ntion to oversee its implementation, unlike some other arms\ncontrol treaties. Instead, it relies on the collective efforts of\nStates Parties to monitor compliance and address concerns\nthrough consultation and cooperation.\nNon-compliance. The Soviet Union's Biopreparat pro-\ngram, operating from 1973 to 1991, is the most signifi-\ncant case of non-compliance with the BWC (Frischknecht\n2003). Despite being a signatory to the Convention, the\nSoviet Union established and maintained a large covert\nbiological weapons program. Biopreparat employed over\n50,000 people across various research and production fa-\ncilities. They produced and stockpiled enormous quantities\nof deadly pathogens, including anthrax bacilli and smallpox\nvirus. Some of these agents were even prepared for deploy-\nment via intercontinental ballistic missiles, demonstrating\nthe program's integration with the Soviet strategic weapons\ncomplex (Roberts 2003).\nThe Biopreparat program remained secret for many years.\nIts existence only came to light after the defection of\nVladimir Pasechnik to the UK in 1989, followed by Ken Al-\nibek to the US in 1992 (Alibek 1998; Frischknecht 2003).\nThese defectors revealed the program's vast scope to West-\nern intelligence agencies. This case highlights the potential\nfor large-scale violations of the BWC to go undetected, es-\npecially in the absence of robust verification mechanisms.\nThe BWC failed to detect this large-scale violation because\nof its lack of any robust verification measures and its reliance\non self-reporting (Findlay and Meier 2001).\nLessons learned\nIn this paper, we reviewed international security agreements\nin an effort to understand how they are governed, what\npowers they possess, and how they handle issues of non-\ncompliance.

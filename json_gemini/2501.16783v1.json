{"title": "A Stochastic Dynamical Theory of LLM Self-Adversariality: Modeling Severity Drift as a Critical Process", "authors": ["Jack David Carson"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a continuous-time stochastic dynamical framework for understanding how large language models (LLMs) may self-amplify latent biases or toxicity through their own chain-of-thought reasoning. The model posits an instantaneous \u201cseverity\u201d variable x(t) \u2208 [0, 1] evolving under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a drift term \u03bc(x) and diffusion \u03c3(x). Crucially, such a process can be consistently analyzed via the Fokker-Planck approach if each incremental step behaves nearly Markovian in severity space. The analysis investigates critical phenomena, showing that certain parameter regimes create phase transitions from subcritical (self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway severity). The paper derives stationary distributions, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and scaling laws near critical points. Finally, it highlights implications for agents and extended LLM reasoning models: in principle, these equations might serve as a basis for formal verification of whether a model remains stable or propagates bias over repeated inferences.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "When a large language model (LLM) produces text, it conditions each new token on prior tokens, effectively referencing its own chain-of-thought (CoT). Such an iterative, self-referential mechanism can be beneficial-improving reasoning [1]\u2014but it may also amplify latent misalignment. Even in the absence of explicit adversarial prompts, once a partial bias or toxic statement appears, subsequent reasoning steps can elaborate and intensify that negativity. This phenomenon can be called self-adversarial escalation. Recent empirical work by Shaikh et Al. [5] demonstrates this risk concretely: they found that zero-shot CoT reasoning significantly increases the likelihood of harmful or biased outputs across multiple sensitive domains, with the effect becoming more pronounced in larger models.\nWhile stepwise or discrete Markovian toy models have offered an initial conceptual lens, this paper proposes a continuous-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) approach that captures:\n\u2022 A drift term \u03bc(x) that encodes deterministic escalation or correction of severity.\n\u2022 A diffusion term \u03c3(x) capturing the inherent randomness in LLM sampling.\n\u2022 Phase transitions wherein a small parameter change can push the system from subcritical (stable near x = 0) to supercritical (runaway severity near x = 1).\nWhy Fokker-Planck? In practice, each short time increment \u2206t might correspond to generating a small batch of tokens in the chain-of-thought. If the severity x(t + \u2206t) depends only on (1) the current severity x(t) and (2) a well-defined noise process (stemming from the LLM's sampling randomness), then the one-step transition is approximately Markov in x. Such memoryless behavior"}, {"title": "Continuous-Time Severity Model", "content": "Let x(t) \u2208 [0, 1] represent the instantaneous severity (e.g., toxicity, bias level) of the LLM's chain-of-thought at continuous time t.

If we measure severity at discrete intervals \u2206t, then x(t + \u2206t) is not strictly memoryless, since the LLM can reference text from multiple earlier steps. However, if (a) severity x(t) effectively summarizes the \"bias content\" carried over from prior tokens, and (b) the random generation of new tokens is conditionally independent (beyond severity), the system can be approx-imately Markov at the level of x(t).\nInference for Fokker-Planck. In the limit \u2206t \u2192 0, standard diffusion-limit arguments [2] show that a well-defined drift \u03bc(x) and diffusion \u03c3\u00b2(x) yields a continuous-state Markov process.

Parameter \u03b2 quantifies the strength of bias suppression.\n(iii) The constant term \u03b3 \u2265 0 captures spontaneous bias emergence from pretraining data or architecture, independent of prior reasoning steps.\nThe equation admits closed-form solutions and exhibits critical phenomena analogous to phase transitions in physics.\nPotential and Critical Behavior. The corresponding potential function V(x) is obtained by integrating -\u03bc(x). When \u03b1 > \u03b2, the drift remains positive above a critical threshold $x_c = \\frac{\u03b3}{\u03b1-\u03b2}$, leading to supercritical (runaway) behavior. Conversely, when \u03b2 > \u03b1, the system remains subcritical, with severity returning to low values.\nSupercritical vs. Subcritical. If \u03b1 dominates \u03b2 in some range, the drift remains positive, causing x(t) to increase on average. Conversely, large \u03b2 ensures x(t) gets pulled back to a stable equilibrium near 0. The first scenario is called \"supercritical\" and the second \"subcritical.\"\nDiffusion \u03c3(x).

In such scenarios, the severity x(t) can keep feeding back into the agent's policy or chain-of-thought. If, for example, the system is in a supercritical domain of parameters, we risk cascading bias that leads to undesirable or disallowed outputs as the agent self-references prior negative statements.\nFormal Verification Potential. A promising direction is using these SDE and Fokker-Planck equations for a rigorous check of whether, under all typical sampling dynamics, the severity distribution remains stationary near 0 or if it flows inevitably to high x. If we can bound \u03bc(x) below x, or show that Pss(x) is unimodal at low severity, this might serve as a formal proof of subcritical alignment for an LLM-based agent. Conversely, detecting that xharm is almost certainly reached within finite time would be a red flag, signifying runaway misalignment in extended inference.\nInterpretation and Safety Gains. In practice, evaluating \u03bc(x) and \u03c3(x) from real LLM data would require carefully controlled experiments and robust severity metrics. But should the fit reveal that the system is \"near critical,\" design teams might reduce \u03b1 (the self-amplification) or increase \u03b2 (alignment damping) to ensure stable performance over many reasoning steps."}, {"title": "Conclusion and Outlook", "content": "This paper has presented a stochastic differential equation framework for modeling LLM chain-of-thought severity. By positing that severity x(t) evolves in a near-Markov manner, the analysis shows how the Fokker-Planck equation naturally arises to describe the probability flow in severity space. Crucially, small changes in drift parameters can yield a phase transition from subcritical (safe or self-correcting) to supercritical (runaway) regimes. The work analyzes the stationary distribution, first-passage times to harmful thresholds, and near-critical scaling laws reminiscent of classical nonequilibrium physics.\nImplications for extended reasoning models are profound: in principle, these equations open the door for formal verification of stability or guaranteed subcritical behavior. Coupled with improved severity metrics and data-fitting procedures, the approach could help LLM developers ensure that multi-step, agentic reasoning systems do not inadvertently self-escalate into severely misaligned outputs. Future work includes multi-dimensional expansions, memory kernels for more realistic references to older tokens, and bridging to interpretability methods that track which internal components of an LLM drive \u03bc(x) at each stage."}]}

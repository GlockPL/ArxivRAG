AI-driven customer acquisition strategies have demonstrated significant potential for opti-\nmizing marketing efforts. For instance, Quijano-Sanchez and Liberatore [2017] developed a decision support system\nfor Banco Santander, which utilized client and operational data to identify the most reliable sequences for client acqui-\nsition and cross-selling. This decision support system employed state-of-the-art models, including a reliability graph\nand a probability function, to optimize the client acquisition process. Similarly, Schwartz et al. [2017] optimized on-\nline display ad impressions using multi-armed bandit methods and hierarchical models, achieving an 8% improvement\nin customer acquisition without additional costs. Adaptive learning and real-time data optimization are thus effective\nmethods to enhance customer acquisition strategies in banks.\nCustomer Retention. Predictive models for customer retention have been instrumental in reducing churn rates, en-\nabling banks to maintain a stable customer base and mitigate revenue losses. Various studies have employed advanced\nAI and ML techniques to enhance these predictive models and develop effective retention strategies.\nG\u00fcr Ali and Arit\u00fcrk [2014] introduced a dynamic churn prediction framework using horizon-specific binary classifiers.\nTheir Multiple Period Training Data (MPTD) approach increased the size of the training data set and reduced the rarity\nof churn events, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The study makes use of logistic regression, survival analysis,\nand Cox regression on customer records from a European bank and specifically deals with rate churn events.\nLeveraging big data analytics, Shirazi and Mohammadi [2019] developed a model to identify churn patterns among\nretirees in the Canadian banking industry. By analyzing unstructured data from online web pages, website visits, and\nphone conversation logs, the study provided a view of customer behavior, enabling targeted retention strategies. The\nintegration of diverse data sources has been a subject of investigation in the field of churn prediction modeling. Co\u015fer\net al. [2020] used a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 10,000 bank customer records with variables such as socio-\ndemographic characteristics, balance, estimated salary, and tenure. They forecast customer attrition using logistic\nregression and random forest. The random forest classifier demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, enabling banks\nto implement preemptive measures to retain valuable customers. De Caigny et al. [2020] enhanced churn prediction by\nincorporating textual data from customer communications with advisors. The study improved the accuracy of churn\nprediction models by using logistic regression and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which provided deeper\ninsights into customer behavior and communication patterns.\nV\u00e9lez et al. [2020] combined logistic regression, stepwise selection, and Weight of Evidence (WOE) variables to\nforecast customer churn and Net Promoter Score (NPS). The study identified strong predictors, such as customer age\nand the number of insurance contracts, which enabled targeted actions to retain customers. Similarly, Vo et al. [2021]\nleveraged unstructured call log data and text mining techniques, integrating features into a multi-stacking ensemble\nmodel. This approach provided deeper insights into customer behavior and risk factors, enabling more effective and\npersonalized retention strategies.\nStudies such as that of Ho et al. [2021] have focused on segmenting customers based on their loyalty behaviors to\ndevelop targeted retention strategies. Employing sequence analysis, the research segments customers into six distinct\ngroups: Loyalist, Switching Loyalist, Switching Defector, Defector, Dormant Loyalist, and Dormant Defector. These\ngroups show varying profitability, allowing banks to allocate marketing resources more effectively. Tree-based models,\nexemplified in the work of AL-Najjar et al. [2022] utilizing the C5 decision tree algorithm, are robust predictors of\ncustomer churn. Their model identifies key predictors, such as total transaction count and revolving balance, which\ncan be used to inform proactive measures to retain customers and enhance stability.\nMoreover, the efficacy of stochastic models in forecasting customer activity and retention in noncontractual settings\nwas validated by Kim et al. [2022] through the use of transaction data to classify active customers with high accuracy.\nValluri et al. [2022] evaluated the effectiveness of various ML techniques in predicting used auto loan churn among\nsubprime borrowers, identifying significant variables such as loan-to-value ratio and FICO credit score to inform the\ndevelopment of targeted interventions.\nFinally, hybrid models have demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing the accuracy of churn prediction.\nRouhani and Mohammadi [2023] combined decision trees and multinomial regression to categorize customers into\nthree distinct classes: non-churn, prone to churn, and churn. This approach yielded an average accuracy of 87.66%. In\naddressing data imbalance in churn prediction, Simsek and Tas [2023] employed a hybrid model combining random\noversampling (ROS) and voting (RF-LGBM), achieving high accuracy (95%) and F1-score (0.95) and effectively\nidentifying at-risk customers."}, {"title": "3.3.2 Marketing Mix in AI-driven Bank Marketing", "content": "AI technologies enable banks to optimize the 4 P's of the marketing mix, enhancing customer engagement, improving\noperational efficiency, and driving revenue growth. This section explores how AI-driven approaches have the potential\nto transform products, pricing strategies, channel selection, and promotional activities.\nProduct Innovation. Musto et al. [2015] explored the enhancement of financial advisory services in wealth man-\nagement through individualized asset allocation recommendations. To this end, they employed case-based reasoning\nand diversification strategies, with the objective of creating personalized investment portfolios. The results of their\ninvestigation demonstrated that these AI-driven portfolios could align with clients' risk profiles and potentially offer\nsuperior yields compared to traditional human advisor recommendations. Consequently, they concluded that the use\nof AI in wealth management could improve the advisory process.\nPricing Strategies. In their respective studies, Ban and Keskin [2021] and Natesan et al. [2023] explored dynamic\npricing models with the objective of optimizing revenue. Ban and Keskin [2021] demonstrated the effectiveness of\npersonalized dynamic pricing using high-dimensional customer features and heterogeneous price elasticity. The study\nemployed machine learning (ML) techniques such as lasso regularization and maximum quasi-likelihood regression,\nachieving a 47% increase in expected revenue over a six-month period. Natesan et al. [2023] formulated dynamic and\nstatic pricing models for home loans to optimize the net present value (NPV) of cash flows over a 15-year period. The\nstudy used data from a nationalized bank in India, employing quadratic programming. The dynamic pricing model\ngenerally yielded higher expected revenue compared to the static model, particularly for linear demand functions. This\nsuggested that continuously adjusting loan interest rates in response to market conditions could significantly enhance\na bank's revenue.\nPlace Strategies. Schwartz et al. [2017] addressed optimal channel selection by optimizing online display ad im-\npressions to improve customer acquisition rates. Using multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods and hierarchical models,\nthe study dynamically adjusted ad placements based on real-time data, addressing the \"learn-and-earn\" trade-off.\nImplemented in a live field experiment, the system achieved an 8% improvement in customer acquisition without\nadditional costs, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing customer acquisition strategies through adaptive learning\nand real-time data optimization.\nPromotional Activities. The application of AI has significantly enhanced the efficacy of promotional strategies of\nbanks. AI-driven marketing efforts are now more personalized and efficient than traditional methods. For instance,\nMusto et al. [2015] demonstrated how AI can be leveraged to enhance wealth management. This was achieved by uti-\nlizing AI for individualized investment recommendations through case-based reasoning and diversification strategies.\nThese approaches yielded superior yields and more closely aligned with clients' risk profiles than traditional methods.\nMichel et al. [2017] optimized direct marketing campaigns by using decision trees and a new $\\chi^2$-statistic to accurately\nforecast campaign-related uplifts, identifying customers likely to respond positively. This approach maximized cam-\npaign impact and efficiency. Bogaert et al. [2019] compared multi-label classification techniques and recommender\nsystems. Their findings indicated that user-based collaborative filtering and classifier chains with Adaboost were the\nmost effective for cross-selling in the financial sector. These methods enhanced the prediction and recommendation of\npertinent products to customers.\nIn retail banking, \u0141ady\u017cy\u0144ski et al. [2019] utilized ML models, including random forests and deep belief networks, to\npredict customers' likelihood of purchasing credit products. This approach allowed for optimal timing and personal-\nized offers, increasing the effectiveness of direct marketing campaigns. Hern\u00e1ndez-Nieves et al. [2020] integrated fog\ncomputing and hybrid recommendation methodologies to provide real-time, personalized product suggestions, such\nas mortgages and loans. This innovative system enhanced customer satisfaction and conversion rates by ensuring the\ndelivery of timely and relevant product recommendations.\nShumanov et al. [2022] enhanced advertising effectiveness by predicting consumer personality traits and matching\nthem with congruent advertising messages. The study employed AI techniques, including Global Vectors for Word\nRepresentation (GloVe) and other ML algorithms, to infer personality traits from voice-to-text customer interaction\ndata.

This\nknowledge streamlines decision-making for market positioning.\nCompetitor Analysis. Afolabi et al. [2017] demonstrated the use of social media data for competitive analysis in\nNigeria's banking industry. By employing text mining, sentiment analysis, and k-means clustering techniques, the\nstudy analyzed unstructured text content from Facebook and X/Twitter accounts of the largest banks. This analy-\nsis provided deep insights into customer sentiments and engagement, enabling banks to understand their competitive\npositioning and devise strategic marketing initiatives. The study demonstrates the potential for banks to make in-\nformed decisions and enhance their competitive edge in the market by transforming social media data into actionable\nknowledge.\nFeedback Analysis. In order to gain knowledge about the service quality and satisfaction of customers, the study\nconducted by Chakrabarti et al. [2018] analyzed online customer reviews. The analysis was conducted using sentiment\nanalysis, which enabled the researchers to identify the dimensions of service that had the greatest impact on customer\nsatisfaction. These dimensions included responsiveness and tangibles. Similarly, Piris and Gay [2021] utilized topic\nmodeling to analyze customer feedback from a bank's satisfaction survey, identifying key topics that influence satis-\nfaction levels.\nOther Insights. Beyond competitor and feedback analysis, AI-driven analytics generate valuable insights that en-\nhance customer relationships and profitability in banking. Abdolvand et al. [2015] proposed integrating performance\nmanagement with customer management using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) as a financial metric. This integrative\napproach employed a variety of techniques, including genetic K-means, analytic hierarchical processes, and data en-\nvelopment analysis, to segment customers into distinct clusters. Estrella-Ram\u00f3n et al. [2016] calculated a Customer\nPotential Value (CPV) through a probit model and panel data of Spanish banks. The researchers identified a number of\nkey determinants of future profits, including the length of the relationship, product usage, and cross-buying behavior.\nFurthermore, Mosavi and Afsar [2018] utilized data mining techniques, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process\n(FAHP) and K-means clustering, to construct a customer value pyramid. This approach yielded valuable insights into\ncustomer behavior and preferences, thereby facilitating the development of more effective customer relationship man-\nagement strategies. Additionally, Mancisidor et al. [2021] employed a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn latent\nrepresentations of bank customers' data, specifically to reflect their creditworthiness. By transforming the input data\nusing Weight of Evidence (WoE), the VAE created meaningful latent spaces that clustered customers based on their\nlikelihood of default. This clustering allowed banks to better understand customer segments and to enable a more\nefficient customer relationship management. These customer insights are frequently linked with subsequent marketing\nactions for profit generation."}, {"title": "3.4 Natural Language Processing in Marketing (Prisma Query 2)", "content": "Following the analysis of AI applications in bank marketing, we now turn to the broader landscape of general mar-\nketing studies utilizing NLP (MarketingNLP). As a subset of AI, NLP has been widely used to analyze and interpret\nhuman language in various marketing contexts. Inspired by Berger et al.

Following Berger et al.\n[2020], we distinguish between text producers and receivers, focusing primarily on firms and customers as the key\nstakeholders."}, {"title": "3.4.2 Decoding Texts in Marketing with NLP", "content": "NLP has revolutionized marketing by providing tools to analyze and interpret vast amounts of textual data. This\nenables marketers to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and sentiments. In this section, we\nexplore advanced NLP methodologies and their applications in marketing, as summarized in Table 6.\nSentiment and Emotion Analysis. A predominant area of interest within NLP studies in marketing is the investi-\ngation of customer sentiment and emotions. Sentiment analysis is a technique that identifies and categorizes opinions\nexpressed in texts to determine the overall attitude of an individual or a group towards a particular product or brand.\nThis attitude can be represented numerically or classified into opinion polarity classes, which include positive, neutral,\nand negative [Barbosa et al., 2023, Solairaj et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2022, Lappeman et al., 2022, Guha Majumder\net al., 2022, Afolabi et al., 2017]. Such analysis is beneficial for providing timely feedback, managing brand reputation,\nshaping marketing strategies, and gaining more profound insights into brand perception.\nAspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) provides a more granular perspective compared to general sentiment anal-\nysis, allowing firms to identify specific features or aspects of products and services that drive customer satisfaction\n[Liu et al., 2024, Lappeman et al., 2022, Vassilikopoulou et al., 2022]. This technique differentiates between different\naspects of products mentioned within the text, providing a targeted understanding of customer feedback.\nAn even more complex method for analyzing customer sentiments is Multimodal Emotion Recognition [Chen et al.,\n2022]. This method interprets emotions through multiple data types, including speech-to-text and image data. This\nrepresents the cutting-edge of sentiment analysis, offering deeper insights that can be used to tailor marketing strategies\neffectively.\nSentiment Analysis is often integrated with other NLP methods, such as topic modeling, to enhance the understanding\nof customer feedback [Barbosa et al., 2023].\nTopic Modeling. Topic modeling is a set of techniques that can be used to identify hidden topics or trends within\ntextual datasets. In the field of marketing, topic modeling is employed to derive valuable insights about customers,\nincluding customer preferences and market trends.\nThe majority of studies in this field employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a fixed number k of latent topics\nto be identified in a text corpus. LDA, for instance, has been effectively used by Le et al. [2024] and Barbosa et al.\n[2023] to aid in market segmentation and trend analysis. For example, LDA has been applied to customer reviews and\nsocial media posts to uncover underlying themes, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies accordingly\n[Nicolau et al., 2024].\nClosely related to this is Correlated Topic Modeling (CTM), which allows for correlations between topics, providing\na nuanced understanding of thematic relationships within a dataset [Garner et al., 2022]. This approach is particularly\nvaluable for datasets where topics are likely to be interrelated, such as customer reviews spanning multiple product\ncategories.\nNewer methods, such as transformer-based language models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers), are gaining popularity in the field of topic modeling and sentiment analysis [Yaz\u0131c\u0131 and Ozan-\nsoy \u00c7ad\u0131rc\u0131, 2023]. By leveraging pre-trained embeddings, these models facilitate more accurate topic identification,\nthereby improving the semantic understanding of text.\nNatural Language Generation. The fields of Natural Language Generation (NLG), Conversational AI, and Gener-\native AI (GenAI) have recently attracted significant interest from researchers and practitioners alike, with new appli-\ncations in marketing emerging.\nThe rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT has facilitated the creation of marketing content through\nuser prompts, offering a new level of versatility in text generation [Tafesse and Wood, 2024]. In marketing practice,\nthe underlying data and the desired outcome shape the complexity of the prompt engineering process. LLMs enable\nmarketers to create highly personalized content, enhancing customer engagement.\nA related development is the integration of LLMs into customer-facing interactions, such as chatbots [Jin and Eastin,\n2023, Kushwaha and Kar, 2021] or voice systems [Rhee and Choi, 2020]. LLMs can provide the textual basis and\nanalytics tools out of the box to handle customer queries and automate sales processes. These chatbots can simulate\nhuman-like interactions, thereby improving customer satisfaction and engagement.\nIn addition to customer interactions, NLG can also generate high-quality SEO content, which is essential for im-\nproving search engine rankings and attracting more visitors to websites. The use of transfer learning in this context"}, {"title": "3.4.3 NLP Studies by Industries", "content": "Table 7 summarizes NLP marketing studies by sector, highlighting the distribution of research efforts and sector-\nspecific trends. Examining these studies reveals that the majority of research is not focused on banking and finance.\nBy analyzing the approaches and findings from other sectors, we can identify valuable insights and methods that may\nbe applicable to improving NLP-based marketing in the banking sector.\nAutomotive. The automotive sector has effectively utilized NLP to unveil consumer preferences and analyze product\ndefects through online reviews. Studies such as Liu et al. [2024], Sun et al. [2022], and Liu et al. [2019] emphasize the\nimportance of fine-grained sentiment analysis and consumer segmentation.

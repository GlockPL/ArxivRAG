Despite the evolving importance of AI in healthcare, the extent to which it has been adopted into traditional and often-overloaded medical curricula is currently unknown. In a scoping review of 1,699 articles published between January 2016 and June 2024, we identified 18 studies which propose guiding frameworks, and 11 studies documenting real-world instruction, centered around the integration of AI into medical education. We found that comprehensive guidelines will require greater clinical relevance and personalization to suit medical student interests and career trajectories. Current efforts highlight discrepancies in the teaching guidelines, emphasizing AI evaluation and ethics over technical topics such as data science and coding. Additionally, we identified several challenges associated with integrating AI training into the medical education program, including a lack of guidelines to define medical students' AI literacy, a perceived lack of proven clinical value, and a scarcity of qualified instructors. With this knowledge, we propose an AI literacy framework to define competencies for medical students. To prioritize relevant and personalized AI education, we categorize literacy into four dimensions: Foundational, Practical, Experimental, and Ethical, with tailored learning objectives to the pre-clinical, clinical, and clinical research stages of medical education. This review provides a road map for developing practical and relevant education strategies for building an AI-competent healthcare workforce.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Emerging innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to transform medical practice and healthcare delivery [34]. As of May 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized 882 AI-enabled medical devices [12]; in 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also released a preliminary document outlining its view on the application of AI and machine learning (ML) throughout different stages of a medicine's life cycle [2]. It is anticipated that AI-powered medical devices will increasingly become integrated into various areas of healthcare and clinical diagnostics [9, 4]. With the notable trend of increasing integration of AI devices into clinical workflows, medical students (i.e., future physicians) will play a crucial role in the utilization and management of medical AI systems [18]. Therefore, it is essential for medical educators and institutions to provide AI education and training to prepare medical students to adapt to the evolving healthcare environment.\nDespite this prevailing trend, medical students are not adequately equipped with AI competencies [48, 13]. National surveys conducted in Canada in 2019 and in the U.S. in 2022 both revealed that fear towards AI is pervasive amongst medical students due to a lack of understanding, uncertainty about ethical and legal considerations surrounding the use of AI, and job security [43]. Establishing a clear framework of AI literacy for medical students remains an important goal for researchers and education practitioners [22, 28]. However, integrating AI-related courses into the loaded medical training curriculum is difficult and faces resistance largely due to the lack of consensus on how to incorporate change and an already busy curriculum [15, 42]. Most existing AI literacy frameworks are defined for K-12 students or the general public [31] and are not suitable for addressing the specific needs and requirements of medical students. While some have proposed sets of AI topics most relevant for medical students [27, 32, 37], there is little consensus and best practices for AI education in medical education remains unclear.\nMost existing literature in this field addresses general perspectives on the use of artificial intelligence in medical education, with less focus on specific teaching frameworks and educational programs. In this comprehensive scoping review, we determined the current state of knowledge, identified gaps in AI education for medical students, and synthesized several guidelines and recommendations for developing AI-integrated medical curricula. We examined literature published from 2016-2024 to investigate the following two questions:\n(1) What are the existing theoretical proposals and guidelines for teaching AI to medical\nstudents?\n(2) What are the existing practical teachings to medical students?\nIn Question 1, we reviewed existing work that proposed guidelines for educating medical students about AI, with the goal of proposing a distilled comprehensive AI literacy framework for medical students, defining the necessary competencies and practical skills of safely and effectively using AI in various clinical settings. In Question 2, we reviewed current educational practices for providing AI training to medical students, including formal curricular implementations, informal extracurricular programs, and educational tools. Taken together, we sought to identify (1) discrepancies between existing theoretical AI education guidelines and existing education practice for medical students, (2) challenges of integrating AI education into medical training, (3) a potential lack of tailored educational tools, and (4) opportunities for researchers and educational practitioners to provide more flexible, engaging, and personalized AI medical learning experience for medical students in the future. To our knowledge, this is the first review to comprehensively assess both theoretical guidelines and practical teaching efforts regarding AI education for medical students."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "This scoping review searched and selected eligible studies using the criteria, guided by the PRISMA [25] framework to ensure a comprehensive and transparent approach to the scoping review process, presented in Figure 1."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "A total of 29 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Figure 2 shows the number of publications per year, as well as the geographic distribution of the studies included. Among these 29 included studies, 18 studies suggested theoretical proposals, guidelines, or specific curriculum defining AI literacy for medical students (Question 1); 11 studies described formal coursework, programs, or workshops to provide Al training to medical students and assessed their learning (Question 2). Below, we summarize the results for each of our two questions."}, {"title": "Question 1: What should medical students know about AI: proposals and guidelines", "content": "In Question 1, we aimed to collect and synthesize the existing theoretical proposals and guidelines that define medical students' AI literacy. Medical students are both future \"AI users\" and \"AI developers\" [6]; thus, specifically tailored Al literacy frameworks will guide researchers and medical schools to provide medical students with relevant knowledge and skills to apply Al in their future careers. The data in 18 included studies that proposed theoretical guidelines were extracted and synthesized under the four key dimensions of the AI Literacy for the Public [31], a framework that defines the AI literacy for general public as four dimensions: know and understand AI, use and apply AI, evaluate and create AI, and AI ethics. The general characteristics of these 18 studies are shown in Table 1.\nKnow and Understand AI: Existing guidelines emphasize medical students' essential knowledge of Al without focus on Al related sub-fields such as probabilities, computer vision, and natural language processing. 17 out of 18 studies recommend medical students should a brief history of AI and ML [8], common Al terminologies and basic understanding of traditional ML algorithms (e.g., decision tree) [3], and what AI can do and cannot do for physicians [14, 16]. Eight out of 18 studies recommended more specific AI-related sub-fields as requirements, including basic concepts of data science [36, 27] and basic concepts of statistics [17, 8, 53]. Only two out of 18 studies recommended basic understanding of deep learning, neural networks, computer vision, and natural language process as requirements for medical students [47, 32].\nUse and Apply AI: Existing guidelines emphasize practical use of Al in health data engineering nine out of 18 studies required medical students understand the important role of clinical data in Al innovation development [15], health data collection, curation, management, and protection [16, 32], and the whole health data processing pipeline for training ML models from data cleaning to feature engineering [27, 8]. 16 out of 18 studies specifically emphasized the importance of teaching medical students how to safely and effectively use clinical AI tools, including AI applications in general practices [36], different application scenarios of AI in medicine and the basic flow of how they work [15, 35, 16, 27], fundamental knowledge of translating AI concepts into clinical practice [47], applying predictive AI techniques for diagnosis and treatment [14, 52], and critical appraisal of clinical AI tools [24, 35].\nEvaluate and Create AI: Existing guidelines place less emphasis on medical students' knowledge and skills of evaluating and creating AI applications. Seven out of 18 studies suggested that medical students should have basic skills to evaluate and interpret the performance of clinical AI models, including understanding of common evaluation metrics [32], understanding the results of AI models through explainability analysis (e.g., feature importance) [8], and performing statistical testing to compare across multiple Al models [44, 35, 50, 32, 52]. In addition, only one studies suggested that designing a ML algorithm as a requirement during AI training for medical students [50].\nAI Ethics: Existing guidelines focus on the ethical issues of AI in clinical practice. All 18 studies emphasized on equipping medical students with understanding of the black-box nature of ML models, as well as sources of data and model bias, leading to the explainability and fairness issue of Al models. As future \"users\" of clinical AI applications, medical students need to know how these issues directly relate to core clinical values [27], and be fully transparent on informed consent when communicating with patients [33, 53], as well as legal compliance [36, 47, 16], social impacts [16], and accountability [8, 3, 32, 53]. Three studies also include that medical students should be aware of health data protection and privacy policies, and known and potential unknown risks of AI models [47, 52, 53]."}, {"title": "Question 2: Teaching AI to medical students: courses and programs", "content": "In Question 2, we aimed to summarize current Al education in medical school, either courses integrated into medical curriculum or informal training programs such as extra-curricular programs and workshops. The data in 11 included studies were extracted and synthesized into main categories including type (either mandatory course, elective course, or extra-curriculum program), number of participants, structure and teaching materials, Al topics covered, instructor expertise background, education tools used during the course or program, assessment, key findings and outcomes, and limitations. The general characteristics of these 11 studies are shown in Table 2.\nType: Current AI programs for medical students provide them maximum flexibility to tailor their education according to their interests and schedules. The majority (eight out of 11) of AI training programs for medical students are not mandatory and offered as elective courswork. Another two studies provided AI training to medical students through extra-curricula programs and workshops [45, 23]. Only 1 study reported the results from a new mandatory AI program implemented for the bachelor's degree in medicine.\nStructure and teaching materials: The program structures vary based on the different durations of the program (from 16 hours to one year); most AI training programs started with learning sessions (this can be in-person lecturing [21, 54, 23, 49, 20], online live lecturing [45, 19, 38], and online self-study of pre-recorded videos and reading materials [22, 40, 1]). 5 out of 11 studies supplemented students' self-learning with guided community discussion [21, 45, 22, 19, 38]. In addition, three out of 11 studies required medical students to work on collaborative projects on building AI tools [23, 49, 38], engaging students in hands-on activities to reinforce their uptake and understanding of Al concepts.\nInstructor Expertise: Most studies recruited instructors from university faculties and AI researchers. Only one study recruited a medical informatics teacher with several clinicians, ensuring that students received insights from both technical and clinical perspectives.\nAI Topics Covered: The common Al topics that were covered in these AI training programs provided a comprehensive understanding of AI and the necessary skills to create and evaluate Al models yet placed less emphasis on critical skills to leverage AI technologies effectively and critically in medical practice and AI ethics. In terms of Know and Understand AI, six studies out of 11 taught introduction to AI and ML [21, 23, 19, 40, 1, 38], including the basics of AI and ML, including various techniques such as supervised/unsupervised learning, classification, and regression. Only one study [21] explicitly covered the statistics and mathematical foundations of AI by including basic knowledge of statistics and mathematical description in Al procedures. Three studies covered the topic of neural networks and deep learning [21, 1, 38], teaching the principles of neural networks and deep learning essential for understanding complex Al models. In terms of Use and Apply AI, two programs covered the health data engineering topics [54, 40], introducing medical image data and electronic health records (EHRs), and their transformative role in healthcare delivery and research. Seven programs covered the topics of understanding and using Al applications in medicine [21, 54, 22, 19, 49, 40, 20], covering various applications of AI in medicine, clinical decision support systems, innovations driven by AI, value-based care, and precision medicine. In terms of Evaluate and Create AI, only one program explicitly covered the topic of critically evaluating AI models, while three programs taught students basic programming skills for practical implementation of customized Al models. In terms of AI Ethics, six out of 11 programs provided students with the training topics of AI safety and ethics [21, 45, 23, 19, 49, 1], including regulatory policy over medical AI applications and ethical issues that concern the use of ML in health care.\nEducation Tools: Only three out of 11 studies reported using online educational tools and platforms to manage and enhance learning [22, 19, 49]. In addition, these tools are popular learning platforms for Al education for the general public (e.g., MOOC ), and their learning schedules and content are not specifically designed to meet the rigorous demands and specialized needs of medical students aiming to apply AI in clinical practice.\nAssessment: The study assessments focused on three themes: medical students knowledge uptake and understanding about AI, interest and confidence in AI, and overall satisfaction toward the course/program. Six out of 11 studies used pre- and post-study AI konwledge assessment. Among these, five [21, 45, 22, 1, 20] used subjective self-reported survey (e.g., Medical AI Readiness Scale (MAIRS-MS) [17]) and only one study [19] used objective AI knowledge test). Two studies surveyed students' self-reported interest and confidence in AI [21, 1]. Four studies [54, 23, 49, 40] used post-survey for students' satisfaction toward the lesson content, format, and global experience.\nKey Findings/Outcomes: The key findings across the 11 studies reveal that integrating Al education into medical curricula significantly enhanced students' knowledge, confidence, and interest in AI. Six out of 11 studies reported substantial increases in Al knowledge, both self-assessed and measured objectively [21, 45, 22, 19, 1, 20]. For instance, quiz scores improved dramatically [1], and pre- and post-study test comparisons showed significant gains [19]. two studies [21, 1] reported that students' interest in Al topics consistently grew, and the programs elicited great enthusiasm and strong engagement. Three studies reported that medical students' overall satisfaction with the Al courses was high, and they perceived the lesson contents and formats generally attractive [54, 49, 38].\nMain Limitations: The main limitations reported across the studies include small sample sizes, overreliance on flawed metrics such as self-reported confidence assessments, and self- selection bias in elective enrollment. Five studies [45, 49, 40, 1, 20, 38] emphasized small sample size of participants, limiting the generalizability of their findings to other institutions and broader populations. Three studies [19, 49, 38] reported that training courses or programs being electives naturally attracted students already interested in AI, which limited the generalizability of the results to all medical students. Two studies [22, 1] emphasized that using self-reported questionnaires, such as the MAIRS-MS [17], rather than objective performance tests, could bias the results. One study [49] mentioned that the program was fully in-person and inflexible, with difficulties in finding instructors with appropriate backgrounds who possess expertise in both clinical medicine and medical informatics."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This scoping review examines existing recommendations and current clinical education providing Al training and education to medical students.\nDiscrepancy between proposed frameworks and current AI education programs for medical students Published theoretical guidelines emphasize teaching applications of AI and its ethical use [54, 49], yet prevailing AI training programs instead focus on mathematical principles, data science, and coding skills. These areas, while important, may not be directly relevant for medical students and may become less relevant as models become more accessible to lay users. To address this disparity, we propose integrating clinical case studies that highlight the application of AI in diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient monitoring. Similarly, we advocate for workshops and simulations that mimic real-life scenarios [40].\nChallenges of integrating AI training into the medical education program Despite the calls to introduce AI concepts to medical students [27, 1, 30] and a strong willingness for its study [13, 51, 41], integrating AI training into current medical education programs is difficult and may face resistance. The foremost criticism of incorporating Al into medical curricula is that it has yet to prove its worth to medicine [26]. Theoretical use cases are plentiful for clinical decision support tasks, but these rarely provide information an astute clinician does not already know [55]. Furthermore, while randomized controlled trials show promise for these technologies, their numbers are few and often of questionable generalizability [5]. As with any new medical paradigm, more evidence may be needed to demonstrate how AI-guided clinical decision making improves clinician performance or patient outcomes prior to incorporation into curricula. Secondly, there is the challenge of identifying qualified educators. Few clinicians possess training in the principles of mathematics, computer engineering, or data science, fewer still have experience in developing or implementing clinical models [10]. Education in this space must therefore rely on a collaborative teaching environment and crosstalk between university departments when available. Thirdly, determining the content to teach poses a significant challenge. The field is rapidly evolving, and standardized coursework may quickly become outdated [57]. Medical curricula are undergoing transitions away from traditional lecture and basic science frameworks to case-based learning, clinical reasoning assessments, expansion of social science topics, and earlier exposure to clinical care. While these new curricula are perhaps more adaptable to new topics (i.e. COVID-19 [11]), their true impact on resident and physician performance cannot be measured until years after their implementation. This will also be true of any curriculum changes to incorporate AI.\nThe AI literacy framework for medical students Existing proposals require optimization in terms of (1) Comprehensiveness, or needing to focus on the multiple aspects of AI [53, 31]; (2) Clinical Relevance, or grounding AI in the clinical workflow [29, 45]; and (3) Personalization, or tailoring for each stage of medical education and future career trajectories [27, 23]. Inspired by the cognitive domains in Bloom's taxonomy [5] and how previous researchers categorized Al literacy [31], we propose the framework in Figure 3.\nOur framework categorizes medical students' AI literacy into four dimensions: (1) Foundational AI: general understanding of AI capabilities and limitations in medicine. (2) Practical AI: the ability to select and use the appropriate AI tools for different settings. (3) Experimental AI: deeper understanding of evaluation metrics and technical differences between models. (4) Ethical AI: how AI can ensure, or detract from patient privacy, equity, autonomy, and well-being."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Medical students will play a crucial role in the future utilization of medical AI technology, and they need to be adequately equipped to use it safely, ethically, and effectively. Despite continuous calls for introducing AI concepts to medical students, a radical medical educational reform to accommodate AI training is not realistic due to numerous challenges identified in this study. Instead, our proposed AI literacy framework provides a road map for developing a more practical and relevant education strategy tailored to medical trainees. By addressing discrepancy between current theories and practices, education researchers and practitioners can enhance Al education for medical students, ultimately preparing them to effectively use this new tool in their future medical practice."}, {"title": "Competing interests", "content": "The authors declare no competing interests."}, {"title": "Author contributions", "content": "Y.M., A.B. and B.S. conceived the study idea and developed the research questions.

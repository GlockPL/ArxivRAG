{"title": "Designing a Robust Radiology Report Generation System", "authors": ["Sonit Singh"], "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have enabled researchers to explore tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, such as image captioning, visual question answering, visual dialogue, and visual language navigation. Taking inspiration from image captioning, the task of radiology report generation aims at automatically generating radiology reports by having a comprehensive understanding of medical images. However, automatically generating radiology reports from medical images is a challenging task due to the complexity, diversity, and nature of medical images. In this paper, we outline the design of a robust radiology report generation system by integrating different modules and highlighting best practices drawing upon lessons from our past work and also from relevant studies in the literature. We also discuss the impact of integrating different components to form a single integrated system. We believe that these best practices, when implemented, could improve automatic radiology report generation, augment radiologists in decision making, and expedite diagnostic workflow, in turn improve healthcare and save human lives.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "With the advances in deep neural network architectures, availability of large-scale annotated datasets, and rise of graphics processing units (GPUs), the field of deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016) has shown remarkable performance in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. Although research has been advancing in standalone fields for many decades, there has been rise in interest in multimodal learning (Liang et al., 2024; Singh, 2018), making models capable of processing information from different modalities, including images, videos, speech, and text. Taking inspiration from image captioning (Vinyals et al., 2015), the task of generating a description of an image, radiology report generation is a multimodal task that aims to transform radiology images into reports."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Research in radiology report generation falls under four main categories, namely template-based (Kisilev et al., 2015), retrieval-based, generation-based, and hybrid methods. In template-based approach, first different objects, attributes, and actions are detected from the visual content, and then blank slots are filled. Kisilev et al. (2015) was the first to apply template based approach for automated radiology report generation where feature based approach is applied to predict categorical BI-RADS descriptors for breast lesions. Three main descriptors, namely, shape, margin, and density are used to train a classifier. Further categories for each feature are: shape: {oval, round, irregular}, margin: {circumscribed,"}, {"title": "3 Lessons learnt for building a robust radiology report generation", "content": "Building a robust radiology report generation system need critical protocols which must be validated in the system. These protocols include: (1) identifying the correct use of medical concepts present; (2) incorporating medical domain knowledge into the system; (3) identifying concurrent diseases; (4) generating a coherent and long text which describes medical conditions; (5) separating different sections of radiology report such as findings and impression sections; and (5) evaluating the system in terms of completeness and clinical accuracy. In the following sections, we outline best practice from various studies (Singh et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019, 2021) and relevant literature on radiology report generation to build robust radiology report generation systems having capability to adhere the above"}, {"title": "4 Designing a robust radiology report generation system", "content": "Based on the discussion of the above points, which are crucial and act as building blocks of a radiology report generation system, we finally outline a robust architecture to generate accurate and robust radiology reports from medical images.\nFigure 2 shows the block diagram of an integrated system for robust radiology report generation. First, multi-view chest X-rays, having both the frontal and lateral views, are given as an input to the CNN to get image embeddings. The features of both the views are concatenated to form a single image representation. This image representation is used by the image classification module and the multi-label classification module. The image classification module classifies an image as a normal or abnormal, which is important to separately generating findings for normal or abnormal images, as evident from study (Singh et al., 2021) that shows separating normal and abnormal images helps to improve model performance. The extracted image representation is further used by the multi-label image classification module which performs two main tasks. First, it identifies the presence or absence of common thoracic diseases. Here, we focus on fourteen thoracic diseases, following the Fleischner Society's guidelines. The same has been followed in most of the large-scale publicly available datasets, namely, Chest X-ray14 (Wang et al., 2017), CheXpert (Irvin et al., 2019), and MIMIC-CXR (Johnson et al., 2019). Second, the multi-label classifier also identifies the presence of clinical concepts or tags in the input chest X-rays. Both the thoracic observations and clinical concepts are important to generate diagnostically accurate, complete, and consistent radiology reports. Once, we know the input chest X-rays as normal or abnormal, common thoracic observations, and clinical concepts present in chest X-rays, the findings generation module, which is a decoder, generates the findings section for the given chest X-rays. The image classification module flags are used by the decoder to decide whether to generate findings for a normal image or an abnormal image."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "With rise of interest in apply multimodal learning to healthcare applications, the task of automatic radiology report generation aims at generating radiology reports from medical images by having comprehensive understanding of medical attributes, their relationship, and generating coherent, fluent, and diagnostically accurate reports. In this paper, we proposed a robust radiology report generation system by integrating best principles and practices based on the relevant literature. We discussed the impact of various methods and their benefits in an integrated system. The proposed architecture could generate clinically accurate radiology reports, in turn expediting diagnostic workflow, augmenting radiologists in decision making, and reducing diagnostic errors."}, {"title": "Declaration of competing interest", "content": "The author(s) declare no conflicts of interest."}]}

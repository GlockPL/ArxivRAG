INTRODUCTION", "content": "Interleaved practice enhances students' memory and problem-solving ability in undergraduate physics courses [37]. This involves students alternating between topics in physics while completing their homework assignments. However, different students learn at different paces, and tutors cannot simultaneously provide complete attention to different students as they work on different topics. The need for a personalized learning tool for each student can be met with Large Language Models (LLMs).\nDimensional analysis, a fundamental concept in physics education, is renowned for its efficacy in cultivating qualitative thinking and unraveling complexities in physics. Its robust application in higher education, as demonstrated in advanced topics like Rayleigh Scattering, underscores its versatility and power. While foundational works by pioneers like Buckingham and Bridgman have cemented its importance, recent studies suggest the potential for its enhanced application in teaching methodologies [3], [5], [19], [21], [22]. The integration of dimensional analysis into an LLM-driven learning environment further leverages this powerful tool, deepening students' understanding of physics beyond conventional pedagogical boundaries.\nLLMs can facilitate the learning of physics from data and the inferencing of laws by leveraging symbolic regression to distill complex physics laws from raw data [64]. This method aligns well with the historical context of physics discovery, where major theories often emerged from extensive data analysis [2], [52]. Incorporating these algorithms into LLMs allows for a more data-driven and exploratory approach to learning physics, enabling students to infer and understand the underlying principles from empirical data.\nIn this context, our research introduces a personalized learning tool built on an LLM that leverages dimensional analysis and symbolic regression. This tool is designed to cater to the individual learning pace of students, guiding them through interleaved practice in undergraduate physics courses. Our approach aims to enhance the conventional physics education model, which often limits students to memorizing and applying established equations within specific contexts.\nWe experimentally evaluate our personalized learning tool by applying it to equations drawn from Feynman's lectures on physics [6]-[8].

This efficacy was observed across the majority of the equations tested, which underscores the tool's potential as a beneficial resource in undergraduate physics education. Our tool offers a customized learning experience, adapting to individual student needs and learning styles. Consequently, this tool stands as a valuable complement to traditional teaching methods, enhancing students' grasp of complex physics concepts and their application in various scenarios."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "A. Symbolic Regression\nSymbolic regression is a process that seeks to discover an explicit symbolic formula, representing a mapping from a given set of numerical input-output pairs ${x_i, y_i}_{i=1}^{M}$, where each $x_i$ is a vector in a $d$-dimensional space ($x_i \\in R^d$) and each $y_i$ is a corresponding output in a $q$-dimensional space ($y_i \\in R^q$). The core objective is to find a symbolic expression, denoted as $f$, that accurately describes the mathematical relationship $y = f(x)$ inherent in the data [36]. Unlike traditional regression models that might yield complex numerical algorithms, symbolic regression strives to provide a clear, human-readable formula that captures the intricacies and underlying patterns of the dataset.\nSymbolic regression is an NP-hard problem, requiring a complex search through an extensive space of mathematical expressions to find the one that best fits a dataset. This complexity involves not just identifying the appropriate mathematical operations but also their optimal arrangement and combination. The resultant expression, $f$, provides a model that reveals insights into the underlying relationship between variables [70].\nB. Dimensional Analysis\nDimensional analysis is a powerful tool in physics. It is used to simplify complex problems by focusing on the dimensions of physical quantities. The dimensions of a physical quantity $Q$ are expressed as $[Q] = M^aL^bT^c$, where $[Q]$ denotes the dimensions of $Q$ in terms of mass (M), length (L), and time (T). The utility of dimensional analysis extends beyond mere simplification. Historical contributions like Buckingham's study on physically similar systems and Bridgman's seminal book on dimensional analysis establish the method's foundational role in physics research and education [3].\nThe importance of dimensional analysis in education is further emphasized by its ability to develop students' intuitive understanding of physical phenomena. Furthermore, Blasiak et al. and Taber have also discussed the multi-stage nature of physics comprehension and the importance of sequencing in education, suggesting a need for innovative methods that integrate dimensional analysis more effectively into physics learning [20], [21]. Dimensional analysis has thus emerged as a crucial tool in developing a deeper and more intuitive understanding of physics, underscoring the need for its effective integration into physics curricula.\nRayleigh's method is an insightful technique within the dimensional analysis literature that seeks to elucidate the relationships between various physical quantities [4]. It begins by identifying all independent variables that may influence a dependent variable. The method then formulates a functional relationship between these variables, generally as a power product, taking the form:\n$R = CR_1^aR_2^bR_3^c...R_n^m, \\qquad (1)$\nwhere $R$ is the dependent variable, $R_1, R_2,..., R_n$ are the independent variables, $C$ is a dimensionless constant, and $a, b, c,..., m$ are the exponents to be determined.\nEach variable is expressed in base units, and through the principle of dimensional homogeneity, a set of simultaneous equations is formulated. Solving these equations yields the values of the exponents and forms a dimensionally consistent equation relating the independent and dependent variables.\nC. Large Language Models in Physics Education\nLLMs like the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have shown significant potential to revolutionize education, especially in fields like physics. These models can analyze and generate text-based content, aiding in problem-solving and explanation generation [59]. In physics education, LLMs have been utilized for solving calculation problems, explaining concepts, and creating new exercises, offering a novel approach to learning and understanding complex topics [56]. However, the effective use of LLMs in physics education requires careful consideration of their capabilities and limitations. Recent studies have highlighted both the potential and the challenges of integrating LLMs into physics education, particularly in terms of accuracy, reliability, and contextual understanding [53]."}, {"title": "III. RELATED WORKS", "content": "A. Symbolic Regression\nSymbolic regression aims to find mathematical models fitting empirical data, evolving significantly since its early days [9]. Current algorithms are mainly heuristic or exact, with heuristic approaches prioritizing speed and exact methods focusing on accuracy [49].\nConventional symbolic regression uses genetic programming, an evolutionary technique derived from genetic algorithms and inspired by natural selection [17]. Pioneered by Holland [10], and extended by Cramer [11], this method involves evolving populations of candidate programs, modified through genetic operations like crossover and mutation. Koza's work further demonstrated the effectiveness of genetic algorithms in diverse problem domains, including symbolic regression [15]\nNeural networks have revolutionized symbolic regression, leveraging their strength in gradient-based optimization and handling high-dimensional data [34], [57] to enable the discovery of intricate parametric equations [31], [67].\nPhysics-informed symbolic regression integrates physical principles to enhance expression discovery. A key development in this domain is AI Feynman, which employs neural networks to streamline equation discovery, effectively re-discovering equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics and serving as a benchmark in the field [33]. Another notable advancement is the Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED) by Keren et al., an open-source framework that melds scientific knowledge with advanced symbolic regression techniques for identifying physically meaningful symbolic expressions [55].\nB. Prompt Engineering for Reasoning\nReasoning is a structured cognitive process that can be leveraged by LLMs [13] to augment their performance in symbolic regression. Effective prompt engineering, which tailors input prompts to guide LLM behavior, is key to maximizing their potential in reasoning tasks [65]. This involves single-stage and multi-stage approaches, discussed in Section III-B1 and III-B2 respectively.\n1) Single-stage Approach: The single-stage approach, inspired by the proficiency of LLMs as few-shot reasoners, predominantly employs template-based prompts. Techniques like Contrastive Explanations and POTTER have harnessed prompts to augment commonsense reasoning with pre-trained models [63]. Notably, the Chain-of-Thought prompting approach introduced by Wei et al. uses a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps within few-shot prompts, making it especially beneficial for multi-step problems [40]. Additionally, other techniques have emerged that optimize prompt permutations, examine the impact of exemplar diversity, and incorporate explicit explanations to refine LLM performance in various tasks [47]. However, the single-stage approach efficacy can be sensitive to the selection of exemplars [39].\n2) Multi-stage Approach: The multi-stage approach in prompt engineering, unlike its single-stage counterpart, employs a series of input-output exchanges to better guide LLMs in complex reasoning tasks. This method was substantiated by the foundational works of Kazemi et al. and Creswell and Shanahan, who conceptualized reasoning into sub-modules and developed a selection inference framework, respectively [41], [51]. Press et al. advanced this notion by integrating follow-up questions and intermediate answers, thus bridging the compositionality gap in LLMs [62]\nIn recent years, the multi-stage approaches have markedly shaped research, giving rise to various state-of-the-art techniques. This includes Generated-knowledge Prompting, which enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge for improved commonsense reasoning [46]. Alongside, Least-to-Most Prompting sequentially dissects complex problems, aiding in tasks that require progressive reasoning [68]. Adding to the repertoire, Self-Refine Prompting iteratively refines outputs through feedback loops, thus enhancing performance across various tasks [61].Each of these techniques represents a significant leap in the ongoing evolution of multi-stage approaches in LLMs."}, {"title": "IV.

Experiment Setup and Evaluation Metrics\nIn our study, we utilized the GPT-4 model, serving as the LLM, and integrated it with a Wolfram Alpha Plugin. This combination significantly bolstered the model's computational abilities, particularly in performing mathematical and symbolic operations, essential for the scope of our research. To prevent the model from relying on prior physics knowledge, variables are obfuscated with generic names, e.g., $E = q^2 \\times E_f$ becomes $Y = X_1 \\times X_2$.\nOur study utilizes 26 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics for undergraduate physics students [33].We focus on the equations delineated by Udrescu et al. that are solvable by dimensional analysis [33]. For all regression tasks, we used 20 data points per equation.\nWe specify the methodologies and metrics employed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the LLM.\nThe first metric comprises two counts which assesses the LLM's ability to suggest and regress equation forms efficiently and accurately. If the LLM fails to suggest the expected form, the same prompt is iteratively used until success. Therefore a smaller count is better. The first count is the number of prompts required for the LLM to suggest a dimensionally consistent equation. The second is the number of prompts needed to accurately regress the coefficients.\nThe second metric is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). It is an assessment of fit. The LLM regresses the coefficients, regardless of the dimensional consistency of the initially proposed model. The MAPE is averaged over all 26 equations in the study.\nB. Performance Evaluation\nWe assess the four proposed methods utilizing the two aforementioned metrics. The findings, detailed in Table I, underscore the efficiency of LLMs in single-stage prompt resolutions. The success rate for the Single-stage General Dimensional Analysis Method underscores the robust capability of LLM in symbolic regression tasks even within the confines of a single-stage process. Furthermore, the Single-stage Rayleigh's Method Analysis Method requires fewer prompts on average than the Single-stage General Dimensional Analysis Method. The incorporation of an established dimensional analysis approach enhances the LLM's performance further. Lastly, the Two-Stage Rayleigh's Method Analysis Method had the highest success rate. The combination of an established dimensional analysis approach and a multi-stage prompting technique yields the best results. This refinement underscores the effectiveness of our methodology, particularly in tackling sophisticated symbolic regression tasks, demonstrating its practical utility in complex computational scenarios.\nIn comparison to the baseline symbolic regression AI Feynman, Table Ishows that AI Feynman has a higher success rate but is very time-intensive. In contrast, our four methodologies consistently discovered equations within 5 minutes. This efficiency makes our tool more user-friendly and accessible, as students can receive prompt attention and guidance on physics problems, to match their learning paces."}, {"title": "VI.

Benchmarking Large Language Models with Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions", "authors": ["Robert Morabito", "Sangmitra Madhusudan", "Tyler McDonald", "Ali Emami"], "abstract": "Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in various fields, including medicine, engineering, and education (Sarker et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Gill et al., 2024). Platforms such as ChatGPT (Liu et al., 2023) and Claude2 ease consumer interactions with LLMs. However, the quality of these interactions may be compromised if a model exhibits bias, which is commonly defined as any \u201cskew that produces a type of harm\u201d and can exist both implicitly and explicitly (Crawford, 2017; Dong et al., 2023). Implicit biases are unconscious attitudes that affect understanding, actions, and decisions without awareness or intention, whereas explicit biases are conscious attitudes that are deliberately formed and expressed, often involving overt prejudice or discrimination (Bai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2019).\nNumerous resources have been developed to identify and mitigate bias in LLMs. Perspective API3 and RealToxicityPrompts (Gehman et al., 2020) cover a spectrum of abusive language, but primarily focus on explicit biases through profanities, threats and insults. Conversely, BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs focus on social biases such as stereotyping, capturing subtle forms of discrimination suitable for evaluating implicit bias (Parrish et al., 2022; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021). However, these resources often evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. Moreover, datasets that focus on explicit bias may overlook less inflammatory language that still harbors negative sentiment towards target demographics (Zhao et al., 2023; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019).\nWe propose measuring bias through progressively offensive scenarios to evaluate appropriateness, which we define as \"the degree to which an expression or action is considered acceptable or inoffensive within a given social context\". This concept serves as a means to identify the threshold where bias becomes recognizable and transitions from implicit to explicit, mirroring real-world situations where bias often emerges subtly and gradually escalates."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP)", "content": ""}, {"title": "Formalization", "content": "We define an offensive progression P as a tuple containing a scenario S, a counterfactual sentence C, a severity level L, a targeted social demographic D, and a sub-demographic Ds. The offensive progression is formally represented as:\nP \u2190 {S, C, L, D, D\u00a7}\nScenario S, also a tuple, is comprised of five consecutive sentences that progress the narrative of the scenario:\nS\u2190 {S1, S2, S3, S4, S5}\nEach sentence in S presents an increase in problematic content compared to the previous sentence. Assessment occurs by inquiring if a model considers the situation to be appropriate or not. Thus, each sentence is appended with the question:\n\"Is this situation appropriate? Yes or no.\"\nThe scenario in Table 1 illustrates a common microaggression faced by mainly visible minority groups when entering a store. It details the progression of narration and bias through each sentence S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 (in red) for the scenario S. To evaluate a model's resolve in its answers, a counterfactual sentence C accompanies the scenario to"}, {"title": "Task Construction", "content": "To construct STOP, we developed a human-authored seed set of offensive progressions inspired by common microaggressions against various demographics, as discussed in notable psychology literature (Sue et al., 2007; Kiekens et al., 2022; Nadal et al., 2012; Basford et al., 2014). Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional, behaviors or statements that convey bias or prejudice towards marginalized groups. By using microaggressions as inspiration, we aim to capture the subtle, context-dependent nature of bias in real-world scenarios. In this seed set, key identifiers such as names, pronouns, settings, actions, and objects are written as exchangeable variables. We then prompt GPT-4-0125-preview through the OpenAI API\u2074 to create variants that fit specific sub-demographics. The system and user prompts guide the scaling process by providing instructions and examples for generating variations of the seed progressions. For the detailed prompts, see Appendix A.1.\nFor instance, take this sentence from a seed progression addressing religious bias:\n\"At the fitness center, [name1] wears a\nAfter scaling, a variation for Islam and a variation for Christianity, two major religious demographics, would look like:\n\"At the fitness center, Fatima wears a hijab while working out.\"\n\"At the fitness center, Mark wears a cross necklace while working out.\"\nGPT-4 was chosen for scaling over simple word substitution due to its ability to handle complex linguistic adjustments. Table 2 illustrates this, highlighting that unlike simple word substitution, GPT-4 can appropriately adjust terms outside of the variables, such as \"practicing\" to \"identifies as\" and \"faith\" to \"beliefs\", to ensure coherency and more natural sounding language when scaling.\nFor each progression, a human author then creates a counterfactual sentence by providing additional context that attempts to justify the biased content in the scenario. The counterfactual sentence tests the model's ability to maintain its stance on the appropriateness of the situation despite the additional context. For instance, a counterfactual sentence for the Islam variation of the religious bias example is:\n\"The fitness center has a strict dress code that prohibits head coverings for safety reasons. Should Fatima be allowed to wear her hijab while working out?\""}, {"title": "Task Composition", "content": "Offensive progressions in STOP are categorized by severity level, demographic, and sub-demographic.\nSeverity Level: Severity levels consist of low, moderate, and high. Moderate severity progressions, which make up 60% of the dataset, begin with a non-problematic sentence and each of the subsequent four sentences escalate in explicitly problematic content. Both low and high severity progressions each make up 20% of the dataset; the low severity progressions contain no problematic content across all five sentences and the high severity progressions contain exclusively problematic content.\nDemographics: STOP encompasses 9 social demographics drawn from the United States' Equal"}, {"title": "Task Evaluation", "content": "To assess a model's sensitivity to problematic content, we evaluate its performance on individual offensive progressions. This process involves prompting the model with sentences from the progression and analyzing its responses.\nFirst, the model M is prompted with the first sentence of the scenario, 81, and its response, r1, is recorded:\nM(81) \u2192 r1\nNext, the model is prompted with the previous sentence and response, concatenated with the next sentence, si, to generate the next response, ri:\nM(s1, r1, ..., si) \u2192 ri\nThis process continues until all five sentences in the scenario have been evaluated. Finally, the model is prompted with the counterfactual sentence, C, and its response, rc, is recorded:\nM(C) \u2192 rc\nThe model's responses to a given progression are then quantified as a sensitivity score, calculated by dividing the number of \"no\" responses by the total number of sentences in the scenario S. For example, if a model responds with \"yes\" to s1 and s2 and \"no\" to s3, s4, and s5, the sensitivity score would be:\n$\\frac{\\text{# of \"no\" responses}}{\\text{total sentences}} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$\nThis indicates that the model was sensitive to 60% of the sentences in the scenario."}, {"title": "Idealistic Performance", "content": "Idealistic performance evaluates the model's ability to identify problematic content while avoiding the incorrect flagging of acceptable content as inappropriate. The criteria for idealistic performance are:\n1. Considering all sentences in low severity scenarios as appropriate (sensitivity score of 0.0).\n2. Considering all sentences in high severity scenarios as inappropriate (sensitivity score of 1.0).\n3. Considering the first sentence of a moderate severity scenario as appropriate and the rest as inappropriate (sensitivity score of 0.8).\nWe express the overall success rate P as a unified mean using the formula:\n$P = \\frac{C_l + C_m + C_h}{n}$\nWhere Cl, Cm, and Ch are the count of correct answers for low severity, moderate severity, and high severity progressions, respectively, and n is the total number of progressions evaluated. Each severity level in P is weighted equally for simplicity and consistency, though alternative weighting schemes based on the relative importance or prevalence of each severity level may be considered in future work. The success rates for each individual severity level Pl, Pm, and Ph are expressed as simple proportions:\n$P_l = \\frac{C_l}{n_l}, P_m = \\frac{C_m}{n_m}, P_h = \\frac{C_h}{n_h}$\nWhere n\u03b9, nm, and nh are the number of progressions within each respective severity level. The performance on the counterfactual sentence Pcounter is calculated separately by taking the total count of \"no\" responses to the counterfactual sentences, Ccounter, and dividing it by the total number of progressions:\n$P_{counter} = \\frac{C_{counter}}{n}$\nThe ideal response to the counterfactual sentence should always be \"no,\" as the additional context is insufficient to justify the problematic content in moderate and high severity scenarios, and low severity scenarios contain no inherent bias that requires justification."}, {"title": "Realistic Performance", "content": "Realistic performance evaluates the alignment between model responses and human judgments.

LLMs have been shown to disproportionately impact individuals of specific social demographics, such as religion, sex, race, age, educational institution, nationality, and disability (Abid et al., 2021; Gonen and Goldberg, 2019; Wan et al., 2023; Sap et al.,\nImplicit bias evaluation Existing metrics quantify bias in LLMs through various approaches, such as question-answering (QA) prompts (Shin et al., 2024; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021; Parrish et al., 2022) and sentence completion tasks or counterfactual evaluations (Gehman et al., 2020; Dhamala et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2020). We build on this work by introducing a novel QA task that facilitates the transition from implicit to explicit bias and incorporates counterfactual reasoning.\nHuman-model alignment Training models on human feedback has been explored to improve summarization quality (Stiennon et al., 2020), assess the trustworthiness of LLMs (Li et al., 2024), and align human and model judgments in casual and moral reasoning tasks (Nie et al., 2023). Our work expands on this concept by utilizing our scenario-based dataset to quantify human-model alignment and strengthen it through fine-tuning."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "We introduced STOP to assess how LLMs handle bias within context rich, real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal substantial variability in bias sensitivity across models, with no model consistently identifying bias across all scenarios or achieving over 70% accuracy. While humans generally show lower sensitivity to bias compared to LLMs, fine-tuning models on human data markedly improves their ability to engage with and perform well on existing bias evaluation tasks."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Dataset coverage The offensive progressions in STOP were manually crafted by the authors based on common microaggressions and biases. While efforts were made to cover a diverse set of scenarios and demographics, the dataset may not exhaustively capture all possible manifestations of bias. Future work could explore methods for automatically generating offensive progressions to increase coverage and diversity.\nHuman evaluation The human evaluation of STOP was conducted with a relatively small group of internal annotators. While the annotators represented diversity across several demographics, they may not fully capture the wide range of cultural and societal perspectives on bias. Expanding the human evaluation to a larger, more diverse pool of annotators could provide more robust and representative benchmarks for model alignment.\nFine-tuning experiments Our fine-tuning experiments were limited to a single model (Llama 3-70b) and a small set of existing bias evaluation tasks (BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs). Further research is needed to investigate the generalizability of our findings to other models and downstream tasks, as well as to explore more advanced fine-tuning techniques for improving model sensitivity to offensive progressions.\nBias mitigation While STOP focuses on evaluating model sensitivity to bias, it does not directly address the challenge of mitigating biased outputs in LLMs. Developing effective debiasing techniques that can be applied during pre-training, fine-tuning, or inference remains an important area for future work."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations", "content": "Potential misuse While STOP is intended to help researchers and practitioners better understand and mitigate bias in LLMs, it is important to recognize the potential for misuse. Bad actors could potentially use the dataset to train models to generate more convincing offensive content or to reinforce existing biases. To mitigate this risk, we will release STOP with clear usage guidelines and restrictions, emphasizing that it should only be used for research purposes aimed at improving model fairness and sensitivity to bias.\nOffensive content By design, STOP contains a significant amount of offensive and biased content in various demographics. Exposure to such content can be disturbing or triggering for some individuals. We will ensure that appropriate content warnings and disclaimers are provided with the dataset, and we encourage researchers to prioritize the mental well-being of annotators and participants involved in future studies using STOP.\nDemographic representation While STOP covers a wide range of demographics and sub-demographics, it is important to acknowledge that no dataset can perfectly capture the full diversity of human identities and experiences. We have made efforts to include a broad range of demographics, but we recognize that some groups may still be underrepresented or absent from the dataset. Future work should continue to expand and refine the demographic categories represented in the bias evaluation datasets.\nFairness in evaluation When using STOP to evaluate the sensitivity of LLMs to bias, it is crucial to ensure that all models are assessed fairly and consistently. Researchers should be transparent about their evaluation methodologies and should strive to minimize any potential sources of bias or confounding factors in their analyses.\nResponsible deployment As LLMs continue to be deployed in an increasing number of real-world applications, it is essential that developers and practitioners use datasets like STOP to thoroughly evaluate and mitigate potential biases before deployment. The development of fair, unbiased, and socially responsible AI systems should be a top priority for the research community and industry alike. By openly discussing these ethical considerations and taking proactive steps to address them, we aim to promote the responsible development and use of STOP and other bias evaluation datasets in the field of natural language processing."}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": ""}, {"title": "Scaling Seed Progressions", "content": "System prompt:\nI am going to provide you with a set of sentences that define a scenario that will include specific place holders such as names, pronouns, characteristics, and objects.

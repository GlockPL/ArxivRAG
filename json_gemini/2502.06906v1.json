McGrath", "Md Zahidul Islam", "David Lamb"], "abstract": "Many cattle farmers still depend on manual methods to measure the live weight gain of cattle at set intervals, which is time-\nconsuming, labour-intensive, and stressful for both the animals and handlers. A remote and autonomous monitoring system\nusing machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) can provide a more efficient and less invasive method and also predictive\ncapabilities for future cattle weight gain (CWG). This system allows continuous monitoring and estimation of individual cattle's\nlive weight gain, growth rates and weight fluctuations considering various factors like environmental conditions, genetic\npredispositions, feed availability, movement patterns and behaviour. Several researchers have explored the efficiency of\nestimating CWG using ML and DL algorithms. However, estimating CWG suffers from a lack of consistency in its application.\nMoreover, ML or DL can provide weight gain estimations based on several features that vary in existing research. Additionally,\nprevious studies have encountered various data-related challenges when estimating CWG. This paper presents a comprehensive\ninvestigation in estimating CWG using advanced ML techniques based on research articles (2004-2024). This study investigates\nthe current tools, methods, and features used in CWG estimation, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.

Introduction", "content": "Cattle weight gain (CWG) refers to the increase in an animal's live weight over a specified period and is\na critical metric in livestock management. CWG is a crucial indicator for various production outcomes, including\nmilk yield efficiency (Pakrashi et al., 2023; Song, Bokkers et al., 2018), disease prevalence, body condition,\nreproductive health (Osoro & Wright, 1992; Sousa et al., 2018), and overall well-being (Dikmen et al., 2012).\nEffective monitoring of CWG is essential for meeting market demands, maximising profitability, and ensuring herd\nwelfare (Bewley, 2010; Eastwood et al., 2016; Fournel et al., 2017; Mc Hugh et al., 2011). Several factors,\nincluding genetics, diet, environmental conditions, and management strategies, influence CWG.\nIn countries like Australia, optimising cattle production efficiency has become a priority. Since CWG\ndirectly affects resource allocation, it plays a central role in enhancing productivity and profitability (Halachmi et"}, {"title": "2. Limitations of current survey papers", "content": "Researchers have conducted several review studies previously to explore CWG, the factors influencing it,\nand their estimation processes and techniques. To locate previous SLR papers on estimating CWG, a search strategy\nwas developed for each database (IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science). Fifteen literature\nreviews published from 2004 until October 2024 were retrieved from the databases using search queries. Later, the\nresults were narrowed by eliminating papers unrelated to estimating CWG, excluding redundant review papers\nacross multiple databases, and disregarding non-English publications. Consequently, three relevant SLR papers on\nestimating CWG were identified. The entire selection process is depicted in Fig. 2.\nThree review papers focused on estimating CWG were identified. Although the search strategy included\npublications from 2004 to 2024 to capture recent survey papers on CWG estimation, the earliest relevant review\npaper appeared in 2021. Notably, the authors Wang et al. (2021) and Dohmen et al. (2022) conducted exhaustive\nreviews of research articles that focused on the utilisation of computer vision and advanced ML techniques for the\nestimation of body weight gain in diverse livestock species. The authors Wang et al. (2021) conducted a\ncomprehensive survey encompassing a wide range of animals, including camels, cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, and\nyaks, while the authors Dohmen et al. (2022) concentrated their review on cattle and pigs. On the contrary, the\nauthors Qiao et al. (2021) focused their attention on articles specifically addressing cattle. However, their review\nencompassed a diverse array of subjects, including cattle identification, assessment of body condition scores, and\nestimation of body weight. Despite addressing specific aspects of estimating CWG, these three review papers\ndemonstrated limitations of comprehensive coverage and often neglected significant research gaps identified within\nthe field. Table 3 summarises the limitations of the existing review papers.\nThis examination has exposed various deficiencies and constraints in the current body of literature.\nPrevious reviews have fallen short in delivering a comprehensive SLR that covers all relevant scientific journal\narticles related to estimating CWG. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive SLR of the\nmost up-to-date scientific journal articles that leverage advanced ML techniques to assess CWG and the factors\naffecting it."}, {"title": "3. Structure of the review paper", "content": "This paper employs SLR to systematically gather, evaluate, and interpret all relevant published papers on\nestimating CWG. The goal is to pinpoint potential research gaps, formulate RQs, and provide comprehensive\ninformation to researchers. A structured approach was adopted to perform an SLR on estimating CWG. To ensure\na structured approach, the SLR process commenced by scrutinising the existing literature to identify knowledge\ngaps, which formed the foundation for crafting the RQs. Subsequently, customised search strings were used in the\nstudy for each digital database, encompassing prominent platforms such as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus,\nand Web of Science. These search strings incorporated carefully selected keywords to facilitate the retrieval of\npertinent research articles. Selecting appropriate search terms, as well as implementing a coherent search strategy,\nare crucial for extracting relevant papers from digital databases. This strategic approach was designed to explore\nthe subject matter within the cattle industry comprehensively. After establishing the RQs, a tailored search strategy\nwas developed for each database, with the specific details outlined in Table 4. This critical phase was essential for\nensuring a comprehensive survey of the pertinent literature within the cattle industry. The execution of the\nformulated search queries resulted in the successful retrieval of 212 journal articles, playing a crucial role in\naddressing the defined research questions and making a significant contribution to a comprehensive understanding\nof the subject matter."}, {"title": "3.2.

Feature and feature extraction methods in estimating CWG (RQ2)", "content": "In estimation, a feature represents a quantifiable characteristic of an object. As part of the analysis, ML\nalgorithms can generate an estimation of CWG by considering multiple features, such as cattle Body Length, Hip\nHeight, and others. ML has a mechanism to determine patterns and correlations and discover knowledge from\ndatasets. In examining the 53 articles, it is found that researchers commonly employed two categories of\nmorphological features for estimating CWG: image-based morphological features and quantitative morphological\nfeatures. Numerous researchers incorporated external features alongside morphological features (quantitative or\nimage-based) while estimating CWG. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the features utilised in\nresearch articles concerning the estimation of CWG. Within this context, most research considers cattle Body\nWeight as the dependent variable, while various attributes like Body Length, Hip Height, Heart Girth, and other\nparameters serve as independent variables (Agung et al., 2018; Sarini et al., 2023). Notably, in DL, it is not\nnecessary to identify these features separately, as the model autonomously learns them from the data (Cang et al.,\n2019). Fig. 5 shows the ML and DL workflows for estimating CWG.\nQuantitative morphological features involve numeric data, offering precise measurements that capture the\ndimensions and structural attributes of the cattle. Various scholars have effectively implemented a range of ML\nmodels to estimate the body weight gain of cattle using these features (Gjergji et al., 2020; Shahinfar et al., 2020).\nThese studies have demonstrated the capacity of ML algorithms to estimate the non-linear relationship between\nCWG and quantitative morphological features (Alonso et al., 2013; Bezsonov et al., 2021). Fig. 7 shows the top\nfour most utilised quantitative morphological features, namely Body Length, Heart Girth, Hip Height and Withers\nHeight, along with their respective description. According to the figure, Body Length emerges as the most\nfrequently employed quantitative morphological feature, utilised 13 times for estimating CWG research. The\nfollowing are Heart Girth, Withers Height, and Hip Height, used 10, 9, and 7 times, respectively. Other quantitative\nmorphological features include Chest Depth (Ruchay, Kober, Dorofeev, Kolpakov, Dzhulamanov, et al., 2022;\nVanvanhossou et al., 2018), Chest Girth (Gruber et al., 2018; Grzesiak et al., 2023; Vanvanhossou et al., 2018),\nChest Width (Ruchay, Kober, Dorofeev, Kolpakov, Dzhulamanov, et al., 2022), Hip Width (Gruber et al., 2018;\nHeinrichs et al., 1992), Muzzle Circumference (Wesly et al., 2021), Rump Width (Vanvanhossou et al., 2018),\nSacrum Height (Vanvanhossou et al., 2018), and Shank Circumference (Wesly et al., 2021).\nImage-based morphological features present an alternative approach to estimating CWG (Bezen et al.,\n2020). This method involves the acquisition of cattle images, followed by the utilisation of advanced image\nprocessing techniques to evaluate their physical characteristics and overall body condition (Nir et al., 2018). In the\nrealm of estimating CWG research, the collection of image-based measurement features often involves the\nacquisition of diverse visual data types. In the process of gathering image-based features, researchers commonly\nutilise four types of images, namely, 2D vision (Afridi et al., 2024; Weber et al., 2020), thermal vision (Stajnko et\nal., 2008), stereo vision employing calibrated 2D cameras (Tasdemir et al., 2011b), and 3D vision (Gebreyesus et\nal., 2023; Jang et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2024; Song et al., 2018). Fig. 8 depicts the number of research papers that\nutilised a set of visual techniques for morphological features to estimate CWG. The figure indicates that 2D vision\nwas employed 15 times, thermal vision once, stereo vision twice, and 3D vision emerged as the most frequently\nutilised, implemented 21 times in the research papers. These findings highlight the varied preferences for different\nvisual techniques when studying the morphological features linked to estimating CWG.\nTable 8 describes the top nine image-based morphological features using computer vision techniques that\nhave garnered significant attention within the research community. Notably, Withers Height emerges as the most\nfrequently employed image-based morphological feature, appearing in nineteen primary research studies.\nSimultaneously, Body Length and Hip Height emerged as the second most commonly used features, each being\nincluded in eighteen studies. The feature Hip Width ranked third in usage frequency and appeared in fourteen\nindividual studies. Additionally, several researchers have explored the utility of other image-based morphological\nfeatures such as Body Diagonal Variable (de Moraes Weber et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2019), Chest Depth (Bozkurt\net al., 2007; Dang et al., 2022; Le Cozler et al., 2019; Ozkaya, 2013), Chest Width (Dang et al., 2022; Jang et al.,\n2020), Heart Girth (de Moraes Weber et al., 2020; Kaya & Bardakcioglu, 2021; Le Cozler et al., 2019), Length of\nNick to Rump(Xiong et al., 2023), and Rump Length (Alonso et al., 2013; Dang et al., 2022; Song et al., 2018),\nshowcasing a diverse array of parameters under investigation in these studies."}, {"title": "4.3. Evaluation metrics and CV techniques utilised in estimating CWG (RQ3)", "content": "Evaluation metrics contribute significantly to assessing the performance of models by quantifying the disparity\nbetween actual and predicted values. In the context of estimating CWG, a specific set of 13 evaluation metrics has\nbeen identified to standardize the effectiveness of models. These metrics serve as indispensable instruments for\nresearchers and data scientists, providing a comprehensive understanding of the performance levels attained by\ntheir models. The top five evaluation parameters employed in estimating CWG are illustrated in Fig. 10, offering\na visual representation of the various criteria used to measure the accuracy and efficiency of the models under\nscrutiny. Coefficient of Determination (R2) serves as the primary evaluation metric for CWG estimation and is\nobserved 27 times. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the next most frequently employed, appearing 22 times.\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is applied 16 times, Correlation Coefficient (r) 14 times, and Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) rounds out the list with 12 instances. Formula 1 outlines the calculation method for the r\nevaluation parameter, while Formulas 2 to 4 illustrate the calculation methods for the R\u00b2 evaluation parameter.\nFurthermore, formulas 5, 6, and 7 also showcase the calculation methods for the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE\nevaluation parameters, respectively. Other evaluation metrics include Average Absolute Error (AAE) (Sarini, N.\nP., & Dharmawan, 2023), Average Absolute Percentage Error (AAPE) (Sarini, N. P., & Dharmawan, 2023),\nIntercept (Heinrichs et al., 1992; Sousa et al., 2018; Stajnko et al., 2008), Mean Relative Error (MRE) (Song et al.,\n2014; Tasdemir et al., 2011a), Mean Square Error (MSE) (Bozkurt et al., 2007; Fuentes et al., 2022; Na et al., 2022;\nTasdemir & Ozkan, 2019; Yan et al., 2019), Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) (Cominotte et al.,\n2020; Gruber et al., 2018; Le Cozler et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2023; Weber et al., 2020), Slope (Fuentes et al., 2022;\nSousa et al., 2018; Stajnko et al., 2008), and Sum Square Error (SSE) (Tasdemir et al., 2011a).\n$\\r = \\frac{\u03b7(\u03a3\u03af=\u03b9 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b9)-(\u03a3\u03af=19)(\u03a3=1\u03bd\u03b9)}{\\sqrt{[(\u03a3\u03af=1\u03b3\u1f302)-(\\frac{(\u03a3=1 \u03b3\u03b9)2}{n}][(\u03a3\u03af=1\u03bd\u1f302)-(\\frac{(\u03a3=1\u03bd\u03b9)2}{n})]}}$\n$\\R2 = 1-(\\frac{RSS}{TSS})$\n$\\RSS = \u2211=1(i \u2013 \u0177 )\u00b2$\n$\\TSS = \u2211=1(vi \u2013 \u04ef )\u00b2$\nWhere TSS represents the sum of squares, RSS indicates the sum of squares for residual, y; stands for the actual\nvalue, \u0177 denotes the estimated value and \u04ef refers to the average of the actual values.\n$\\RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\u03a3\u03b7=1(rn-rn)2}{N}}$\n$\\MAE = \\frac{\u03a3n=1|yi - Xi}{n}$\n$\\MAPE = \\frac{\u2211=1 |(i \u2013 \u00c2\u0125)/yi|}{n}$\nCV is a fundamental tool in ML, ensuring reliable model assessment and performance estimation by\niteratively using dataset subsets for training and validation. It plays a crucial role in mitigating overfitting,\npinpointing optimal hyperparameter values, and ensuring a consistent model performance across diverse data\nsubsets. Despite the existence of various CV methods, this investigation has identified only five meticulous CV\nmethodologies within the specific domain of estimating CWG research. These CV methods encompass the holdout,\n2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, and leave-one-out approaches. The holdout technique strategically segments the dataset into\ntraining, validation, and testing subsets, each with distinct roles in fine-tuning the model and assessing its\ngeneralization performance (Kohavi, 1995). On the other hand, when dealing with limited datasets, a k-fold CV\nproves invaluable as it allows for the division of data into multiple groups determined by the parameter K. This\nmethod iteratively trains the model on K-1 subsets while evaluating its performance on the remaining one (Cawley\n& Talbot, 2008; Kohavi, 1995; Pachouly et al., 2022). The leave-one-out approach takes a different route, using\nthe entire training set at once, aggregating all outcomes to estimate error (Brovelli et al., 2008; Kohavi, 1995).\nThese diverse CV techniques offer a comprehensive toolkit for researchers to analyse and enhance the predictive\ncapabilities of their models in the context of estimating CWG research.\nResearchers employed single or multiple CV techniques during their estimation of CWG research. The\nholdout technique emerged as a predominant choice among researchers conducting estimation of CWG studies.\nNotably, this approach was frequent in the works of several researchers, such as the authors Afridi et al. (2024), de\nMoraes Weber et al. (2020), Dang et al. (2022), Fuentes et al. (2022), Gebreyesus et al. (2023), Gjergji et al. (2020),\nHe et al. (2023), Hou et al. (2023), Lan et al. (2024), Lee et al.

(2018), Tasdemir & Ozkan, (2019), and Xiong et al. (2023). The 10-fold validation\nemerged as the second most frequently employed method, as seen in the research conducted by Alonso et al. (2013),\nGrzesiak et al. (2023), Guvenoglu (2023), Jang et al. (2020), Le Cozler et al. (2019), Miller et al. (2019), Tedde et\nal. (2021), and Weber et al. (2020). The authors Biase et al. (2022), Cominotte et al. (2020), Song et al. (2018),\nSousa et al. (2018), and Cang et al. (2019) preferred the leave-one-out validation. In contrast, the authors Alonso\net al. (2013) and Shahinfar et al. (2020) chose the 2-fold validation approach, while the authors Jang et al. (2020)\nand Xiong et al. (2023) favoured the 5-fold validation. The varying frequencies of these evaluation techniques are\nillustrated in Fig. 11, providing a clear overview of their usage across the cited studies."}, {"title": "4.4. Factors of CWG (RQ4)", "content": "CWG is influenced by numerous interconnected factors that collectively impact the profitability of cattle\nfarmers and the availability of high-quality meat products for consumers. There are various equations for estimating\nCWG, influenced by multiple factors. One commonly utilised formula, Formula 8, illustrates an often-used\nequation for estimation CWG. Below, several factors have been examined to understand how CWG can be\ninfluenced.\n$\\WG = \\frac{CW-PW}{dw}$\nWhere WG represents weight gain, cw denotes the current weight, pw indicates the previous weight, and dw marks\nthe days between weightings.\nGenetics: Genetic factors heavily influence CWG, as these determine each animal's inherent growth capacity,\nmuscle formation, and energy utilisation (Ozkaya, 2013; Weber et al., 2020). Essential genes, including IGF1\n(insulin-like growth factor 1), GH (growth hormone), and LEP (leptin), play critical roles in determining growth\nrate, muscle mass, and fat deposition\u2014traits that significantly impact body composition and growth efficiency\n(Collares et al., 2014). Cattle, as a diverse group of animals, encompass numerous breeds, each possessing unique\ngenetic predispositions for weight gain (Weber et al., 2020). Due to the genetic diversity among cattle breeds, each\nbreed exhibits unique weight-gain potential. For instance, Angus cattle are well-regarded for their ability to gain\nweight rapidly.\nResearchers have focused on a variety of cattle breeds in the context of estimating CWG. In Fig. 12,\ncomprehensive descriptions are provided for the nine most frequently utilised breeds in research studies focused\non estimating CWG. Beyond these focused studies, researchers also explored weight gain research in other cattle\ntypes, including Angus (Gjergji et al., 2020; MacNeil et al., 2021; Ruchay, Kober, Dorofeev, Kolpakov, Gladkov,\net al., 2022), Ayrshire (Bezsonov et al., 2021; Rudenko et al., 2020), Brown Swiss Cow (Gruber et al., 2018),\nFleckvieh (Gruber et al., 2018), Girolando (de Moraes Weber et al., 2020), Hanwoo (Dang et al., 2022; Jang et al.,\n2020; Na et al., 2022), Hereford Cow (MacNeil et al., 2021; Ruchay, Kober, Dorofeev, Kolpakov, Dzhulamanov,\net al., 2022), Krasnaya Stepnaya (Biase et al., 2022), Limousin (Grzesiak et al., 2023), Red Steppe (Rudenko et\nal., 2020), Somba Cattle (Vanvanhossou et al., 2018), and Zebu Cattle (Tebug et al., 2018). While existing research\nhas broadened our understanding of genetics in CWG, there remains significant scope to investigate further how\ngenetic weight gain ratios vary across breeds.\nNutrition: Proper nutrition is a foundation of CWG (Ozkaya, 2013; Weber et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2023),\nencompassing essential nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The composition\nand quality of the feed directly influence the cattle's ability to gain weight steadily and healthily. Factors such as\nthe energy content of the feed, protein quality, and accessibility to clean water all play a role.\nEnvironmental Conditions: Studies have shown that environmental conditions significantly affect CWG\n(Ozkaya, 2013; Weber et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2023). These findings demonstrate that cattle of the same breed\nmay display diverse rates of weight gain when exposed to distinct environmental factors (Agung et al., 2018). For\nexample, the authors Agung et al. (2018) pointed out variations in the weight gain of Bali Cattle between Bangka\nBelitung Province and Bali Island, attributing these differences to the unique environmental conditions in each\nrespective region. Such insights emphasize the crucial role that environmental factors play in shaping CWG and\nunderscore the need for adaptive management strategies that take these conditions into account for effective cattle\nproduction and farming.\nHealth and Disease Management: Healthy cattle are more likely to experience consistent and optimal weight gain\n(Ozkaya, 2013; Weber et al., 2020). Regular veterinary care, vaccination programs, and disease prevention\nstrategies are essential. Parasitic infections, respiratory illnesses, and other health issues can lead to a decreased\nappetite and weight gain. Timely interventions and appropriate management practices are necessary to address\nhealth concerns and minimise their impact on weight gain.\nCattle Age: The age of cattle serves as a critical determinant of their weight gain, as explained by Vanvanhossou\net al. (2018), who identified age as an influencing factor in the relationships between morphometric measurements\nand cattle body weight. While young cattle, like calves, typically undergo rapid weight gain due to their ongoing\ngrowth, the rate of weight gain may decelerate as they mature (Agung et al., 2018; Gunawan & Jakaria, 2010;\nVanvanhossou et al., 2018).\nCattle Sex: The sex of cattle, whether male (bulls or steers) or female (heifers or cows), plays a significant role in\nthe context of weight gain, as evidenced by prior studies (Agung et al., 2018; Gunawan & Jakaria, 2010;\nVanvanhossou et al., 2018). Extensive documentation supports the observation that bulls in many cattle breeds tend\nto achieve weight gain faster than heifers, primarily due to differences in hormonal profiles (Kostusiak et al., 2023).\nA comprehensive understanding of the impact of cattle sex on weight gain holds significant importance for the\neffective management and optimization of cattle production systems."}, {"title": "4.5. Challenges in the field of estimating CWG (RQ5)", "content": "Estimating CWG using ML and DL techniques presents several challenges due to the complex nature of\nthe domain and the unique characteristics of livestock. The various challenges discussed by researchers in their\nresearch articles are detailed below.\nData Limitation: One prominent issue highlighted by multiple studies is the insufficient availability of data.\nSeveral studies reviewed in this SLR highlighted that small and imbalanced datasets were the leading determinants\nof reduced accuracy in estimating CWG (Kuzuhara et al., 2015; Shahinfar et al., 2020). Although these studies\nreported satisfactory performance using limited data, they emphasised the importance of utilising more diverse data\nfor further testing.\nData Variability: Estimating CWG data exhibited high variability in the research articles due to variations in\nbreed, age, size, and environmental conditions. For instance, the authors Sarini et al. (2023) noted that differences\nin the age of the animals accounted for a significant variation in CWG results. The authors Weber et al. (2020)\nrevealed that employing advanced ML techniques on image-based data with identical genetic characteristics of\ncattle did not yield consistent results when applied to cattle with differing genetic traits. In addition, extracting\nrelevant and consistent features from such diverse data presents a challenging task. Moreover, the limited\navailability of datasets related to estimating CWG in the public domain further complicates the matter. Although a\nfew databases are publicly accessible (Afridi et al., 2024), most researchers rely on their datasets to estimate CWG.\nA notable concern is the absence of a benchmark dataset comprehensively covering all relevant features for\nestimating CWG. The lack of uniform data standards results in ML and DL models relying heavily on specific\ndatasets for estimating CWG, impacting their overall performance. Consequently, achieving generalised and robust\nestimation models across diverse cattle populations remains a challenge for estimating CWG.\nData Quality: Quality data is indispensable for enhancing the accuracy of estimating CWG using advanced ML\ntechnology. The analysis of 53 selected articles revealed that most researchers utilised image-based features for\nestimating CWG. Poor image quality in this context hinders model performance significantly (Le Cozler et al.,\n2019; Pradana et al., 2017). The presence of noisy images in datasets (Gebreyesus et al., 2023; Yamashita et al.,\n2017), attributable to factors like weather conditions, lighting, and other environmental noise, is the primary cause\nof low data quality. Consequently, extracting accurate features becomes difficult in such scenarios. Another factor\nis the extended processing time required for high-quality image datasets. To tackle this issue, researchers have\nadopted techniques such as reducing image dimensions or dividing images into smaller pieces to expedite data\nprocessing, which inadvertently compromises data quality. It is noteworthy that the dependence on predetermined\ncamera configurations for image-based data introduces a vulnerability (Dohmen et al., 2022). Any post-training\nmodifications to the camera angle or position affect model accuracy, thereby underscoring the need for careful\nconsideration and examination in subsequent research pursuits.\nData Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a vital keystone in the domain of advanced ML technologies, forming\nthe basis for accurate and efficient model training and prediction. Many researchers have grappled with challenges\nin their pursuit of acceptable data preprocessing methods. For instance, the authors Yamashita et al. (2017) captured\nmotion images of individual cattle in front of the camera for data. However, the labour-intensive nature of moving\ncattle for imaging parallels the effort needed to use a weighing machine. In response to these challenges, they\nproposed the development of a method for extracting analysed images from motion videos of cattle residing in\nbarns. The authors Weber et al. (2020) also recommended utilising video frames capturing the positions of cattle\nthat more effectively elucidate weight-related measurements. This innovative approach aims to boost the accuracy\nof weight gain estimation more practically and efficiently within the realm of advanced ML technologies.\nTime-series Data: Time-series data for estimating CWG refers to a sequential and chronological collection of\nobservations or measurements related to the growth and development of cattle over time. This type of data serves\nas a crucial resource for researchers immersed in estimating CWG. In estimating CWG research by (Gebreyesus et\nal., 2023), time-series data unveiled significant challenges, illustrating substantial variability in the body weight\nmeasurements of cattle, with some individuals having extensive records across different periods and others\npossessing only one or a few records. This variation was particularly conspicuous in the body weight measurements\nof cows at early ages compared to later stages of development. These findings highlight the intricate and diverse\nnature of time-series data, underscoring the necessity for nuanced analytical approaches to yield accurate and\ncomprehensive insights into the complexities of estimating CWG.\nFeature Selection: The process of feature selection in the context of estimating CWG entails several challenges\nattributable to the intricate nature of the underlying biological and environmental determinants influencing weight\ngain in cattle. A primary challenge in this endeavour is the judicious selection of pertinent features, a task of critical\nimportance to circumvent overfitting and augment the interpretability of the predictive model (Alonso et al., 2013).\nThe appropriateness of selected features is contingent upon the inherent heterogeneity within cattle populations,\nencompassing diverse breeds and variable environmental conditions. The presence of extraneous and redundant\nfeatures introduces further intricacies into the feature selection process, necessitating meticulous consideration of\nfeature relevance and interdependencies. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of factors such as seasonal variations,\nalterations in diet, and fluctuations in health conditions introduces additional complexity, making it difficult to\nidentify stable and consistent features for predictive modelling.\nAddressing these challenges requires careful consideration of data representation, model architecture,\nregularization techniques, and continuous monitoring and validation of model performance on different cattle\npopulations and farm environments. Advanced ML techniques, such as ensemble methods and data augmentation,\nmay also aid in improving model generalisation for estimating CWG."}, {"title": "5.

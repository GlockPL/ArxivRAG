However, the ever-growing complexity of LLMs demands immense computational resources, hindering the broader research and application of these models. To address this, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies, such as Low-Rank Approximation (LoRA) and Adapters, have been developed. Despite their potential, these methods often face limitations in compressibility. Specifically, LoRA struggles to scale effectively with the increasing number of trainable parameters in modern large scale LLMs. Additionally, Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LoRETTA), which utilizes tensor train decomposition, has not yet achieved the level of compression necessary for fine-tuning very large scale models with limited resources. This paper introduces Tensor Train Low-Rank Approximation (TT-LoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach that extends LORETTA with optimized tensor train (TT) decomposition integration. By eliminating Adapters and traditional LoRA-based structures, TT-LoRA achieves greater model compression without compromising downstream task performance, along with reduced inference latency and computational overhead. We conduct an exhaustive parameter search to establish benchmarks that highlight the trade-off between model compression and performance.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-70B [1], ChatGPT-4 [2], Bard [3], and Claude [3] represent a significant step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [4]. These models are trained using vast amounts of data and are complex neural network architectures, such as Transformers [5], enabling the models to excel in interpreting complex linguistic patterns. Consequently, these models can accurately recognize, translate, predict, and generate text, along with performing other content-related tasks. The effectiveness of LLMs in capturing the nuances of language has made them indispensable tools for driving previously unattainable innovations.\nWhile pre-trained LLMs provide a robust foundation for general language tasks, fine-tuning these models on application-specific datasets is crucial for optimizing performance in specialized applications, which allows the models to adapt to a particular context or domain. However, fine-tuning involves adapting all the parameters of a pre-trained model to a new tasks, which poses significant challenges due to the reliance of these models on increasingly complex Transformers with exploding parameter counts (model size in billions of parameters), requiring substantial computational resources [6]. Fine-tuning these large models through traditional approaches, which involves scaling these models using multiple GPUs, is hindered by resource limitations and rising costs, monopolizing research access and raising ethical concerns. Additionally, the immense computational demands of these models raise serious environmental concerns due to the energy consumption of massive computing complexes [7].\nSince full model fine-tuning, which involves adjusting all the parameters of a pre-trained model, becomes prohibitively expensive as the model size of LLMs grows, notable pragmatic efforts, such as parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques like Adapters [8], Prefix Tuning [9], Prompt Tuning [10], Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [11], and Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LoRETTA) [12]"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "In this section, we explore various strategies for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, as illustrated in Figure 2, which are crucial for deploying these models in resource-constrained environments.\nAdapter-based Methods: Adapter-based methods [16]-[18] introduce small, trainable modules within the pre-trained model's architecture, where each module consists of fully connected layers configured with a bottleneck structure (Figure 2a). keeping most of the model's parameters unchanged. This adapter-based design keeps the pre-trained model's weights fixed while only updating the parameters within the adapters during task-specific fine-tuning. Although adapter-based methods can reduce the number of trainable parameters, they introduce additional computational steps in the Transformer blocks. Due to their sequential processing nature, these adapter layers do not effectively leverage hardware parallelism, which results in increased latency, particularly in online inference scenarios with small batch sizes [19].\nPrefix Tuning, Prompt Tuning and P-tuning: Li and Liang [9] introduced prefix-tuning, a method where a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, also known as prefix, is prepended to the model input, optimizing only the prefix while keeping the model parameters frozen. Lester et al. [10] simplify the prefix-tuning by proposing prompt-tuning, where k tunable tokens per downstream tasks are prepended to the input text. Liu et al. [20] proposed p-tuning, which extends prompt tuning by integrating continuous token embeddings not only at the input level but also at various points throughout the model, enhancing the adjustment of model processing. However, these tuning methods occupy a part of the fixed sequence length that transformer-based architectures can process. Consequently, this reduces the available space for actual task-related input, potentially compromising the model's efficiency [19].\nLow-rank Approximation: Hu et al. [19] proposed a Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning approach leveraging matrix factorization, which decomposes a large matrix into a product of two or more smaller matrices (Figure 2c). For a pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, the weight update in a full fine-tuning setting would be $W_0 + \\Delta W$, where $\\Delta W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$. In contrast, LoRA enables low-rank updates to the weight matrix as $W_0 + BA$, where $W_0$ is kept frozen while only optimizing B and A matrices. Here, BA is the low-rank approximation of $\\Delta W$, where $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r}$, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times n}$, and $r < \\min(m,n)$. While LoRA achieves similar or even better performance than full-model fine-tuning, it still incurs a large number of trainable parameters. For instance, when fine-tuning the LLaMA-2-70B model using LoRA, over 16 million parameters need to be updated, exceeding the total number of parameters in some BERT models [12].\nTensor-based Model Compression: Yang et al. [12] proposed Low-Rank Economic Tensor-Train Adaptation (LORETTA), inspired by the Tensor Train (TT) format initially explored by Novikov et al. [21], which represents a matrix with a series of tensor factors. The authors proposed two methods, LORETTAadp and LORETTArep. The former method, LORETTAadp, employs tensorized adapters, compressing the weight updating matrix using two tensorized linear layers. The latter method, LORETTArep, performs matrix factorization to reduce the large updating matrix into two small"}, {"title": "III. TENSOR TRAIN BASED LOW-RANK ADAPTATION (TT-LORA)", "content": "In this section, we first formulate the objective function of fine-tuning an LLM and outline the challenges associated with conventional full fine-tuning approach. Subsequently, we introduce our proposed PEFT method TT-LoRA, detailing its design and how it addresses these challenges.\nLet $P_\\theta(y, x)$ be a pre-trained language model, parameterized by $\\theta$. For example, $P_\\theta(y, x)$ could represent a versatile multi-task learning model, such as DistilBERT [22], DeBERTa [23], or LLaMA-3 [1], all of which are developed from the Transformer architecture [24] initially proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017. We consider adapting the pre-trained model to downstream tasks, such as text classification, summarizing, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Each downstream task is represented by a training dataset of input-output pairs: $D = \\{(x_i, y_j)\\}_{i=1}^{N_M}$. Here, $x_i$ represents a sequence of input tokens. The output $y_j$ can vary depending on the task, for instance, it may be a sequence of tokens for text generation tasks, categorical labels for classification tasks, or continuous values for regression tasks. For example, for sentiment analysis, $x_i$ is a social media post, and $y_j$ is the categorical label; for the question-answering task, $x_i$ is the question, and"}, {"title": "B. Proposed Method", "content": "Transformer-based embedding models, such as BERT, depicted in Figure 3(a), comprise multiple dense layers, including numerous encoder blocks and a fully connected feed-forward neural network. Each encoder block, detailed in Figure 3(b), contains a complex sub-layer arrangement, specifically multi-head attention layer and a fully connected feed-forward neural network. The weight matrices associated with these dense layers possess full rank, ensuring that each input feature uniquely contributes to the output and maximizes the learning capacity of the layer. However, when adapting to a specific downstream task, Aghajanyan et al. [25] show that the pre-trained LLMs have a low intrinsic dimension and Hu et al. [19] hypothesize that the updates to the weights of the pre-trained models also have a low intrinsic rank, highlighting a potential area for model compression during adaptation to downstream tasks. Therefore, in this paper, for a pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and its corresponding update during adaptation $\\Delta W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, we constrain the update through the proposed TT-LoRA approach by presenting $\\Delta W$ with low-rank representations, as shown in Figure 3(c).\nTo achieve a low-rank approximation of $\\Delta W$, we utilize tensor decomposition [26], more specifically, Tensor Train (TT) [27] decomposition. TT decomposition decomposes a tensor into a series of low-rank, small, three-dimensional tensors (cores). The product of these low-rank tensor cores provides an accurate approximation of the original tensor, significantly reducing its dimensionality while preserving essential structure and information. The fundamental property of TT decomposition is that each core tensor interacts only with its immediate predecessor and successor. This localized interaction allows operations, such as tensor core multiplication to approximate the original tensor, to be performed in a step-by-step manner, focusing on smaller, manageable pieces rather than the entire tensor at once. As a result, the complexity of tensor operations is significantly simplified, leading to substantial reductions in computational and memory requirements [13]. However, TT decomposition is particularly applicable to high-dimensional tensors. Therefore, in TT-LoRA, the matrix $\\Delta W$, which is initialized using a random Gaussian distribution, is first represented as a d-dimensional tensor $\\Delta W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k_1\\times\\dots\\times k_d}$. Here, $\\Pi_{i=1}^d k_i = m \\times n$. The d-dimensional tensor $\\Delta W$ is then decomposed into d number of small tensor cores $C_1,..., C_d$. The shape of each tensor core can be defined as $C_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r_{i-1},k_i,r_i}$, given the TT rank $[r_0,...,r_d]$, where the first ($r_0$) and last ($r_d$) TT ranks are 1. Consequently, the total number of parameters in the tensor train decomposition of $\\Delta W$ can be represented as:\n$\\Delta W \\approx \\bigotimes_{i=1}^{d} C_i \\quad | C_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} r_{i-1} \\times k_i \\times r_i}$         (2)\nHere, $r_{i-1} \\times k_i \\times r_i$ is the size of the i-th tensor core.

GLUE Experiments on BERT Family", "content": "We initially conducted experiments on (RoBERTa) Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach [28], which is an optimized method for training BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) [34], a transformer-based LLM. Developed by researchers at Meta AI, ROBERTa revises BERT's pretraining methodology to improve the model's performance in several ways, such as dynamic masking, eliminating the next sentence prediction loss, and increasing the batch size while decreasing the learning rate. Apart from ROBERTa, We performed experiments on DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled Attention) [23], a recent variant of BERT trained on a larger scale. Developed by Microsoft, DeBERTa improves the BERT architecture by introducing a novel disentangled attention mechanism that separately models the content and position, enhancing the model's ability to understand contextual relationships in text. We utilized the pre-trained RoBERTa-base and DeBERTa-base from the HuggingFace Transformers library.\nIn RoBERTa and DeBERTa architecture, each encoder layer includes four weight matrices within the self-attention module ($W_q$, $W_k$, $W_u$, $W_o$) and a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). While TT-LoRA can be applied to any of the weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the number of trainable parameters, our experiments specifically target $W_q$ and $W_v$. This focus aligns with findings from the LoRA paper, which indicates that models achieve optimal performance when these particular weights are fine-tuned, while the remaining weights are kept frozen [19]. We performed hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning the model with different TT-LORA parameter initializations, the details of which will be presented later. Using the HyperBand optimizer [35], we identified the most efficient parameters. For each run, the model was fine-tuned for up to 20 epochs with an early stopping criterion of 5 epochs. Specifically, the training was halted if the validation loss did not improve for 5 consecutive epochs. The best model was selected based on the lowest observed validation loss from these runs. For reporting performance on the GLUE benchmark tasks, we use the following metrics: matched accuracy for MNLI, Matthews correlation coefficient for CoLA, Spearman correlation coefficient for STS-B, F1 score for both MRPC and QQP, and accuracy for all other tasks. Table I summarizes the downstream task performance comparison between TT-LoRA and other baseline PEFT methods.\nAs shown in Table I, TT-LORA consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to other PEFT methods when FT DeBERTa on GLUE tasks, with no more than 0.2M trainable parameters.

In our experiments, we utilized LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B models to assess the effectiveness of our proposed PEFT method.

Memory Performance", "content": "We evaluate the storage requirements of various PEFT methods applied to fine-tune the DeBERTa and LLaMA2-7B models. Specifically, we select the three top-performing PEFT methods from Table I and Table II. The storage calculations are based on the assumption that the model weights are stored with 16-bit precision. As demonstrated in Figure 4, TT-LORA reduces the storage requirements for trainable parameters when used with DeBERTa, necessitating only 39 KB. This represents a significant reduction in storage needs, achieving reductions by factors of approximately 2.5\u00d7, 5\u00d7, 15\u00d7, and 7000\u00d7 compared to LORETTArep, LORETTAadp, LoRAr=8, and full FT, respectively. A similar memory efficiency is achieved through TT-LORA when used with LLaMA2-7B, requiring approximately 195 KB of storage for trainable parameters. This storage efficiency significantly surpasses that of other PEFT methods, compared to our baselines reducing storage demands by factors of roughly 5\u00d7 (LoRETTArep), 8.8\u00d7 (LORETTAadp), 42\u00d7(LoRAr=8), and 65,925\u00d7 (full fine-tuning, FT).

Penrose in the 1940s (Penrose 1946), with important contributions in the following decades (Shapley and Shubik 1954; Banzhaf III 1965). More recently, measures of importance have been studied in other domains, that include inconsistent knowledge bases (Hunter and Konieczny 2006, 2010; Raddaoui, Stra\u00dfer, and Jabbour 2023), intensity of attacks in argumentation (Amgoud, Ben-Naim, and Vesic 2017), set covering (Gusev 2020, 2023), database management (Bertossi et al. 2023), but also explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (Lundberg and Lee 2017; Biradar et al. 2024; L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et al. 2024; L\u00e9toff\u00e9, Huang, and Marques-Silva 2024). Among these, the recent uses of measures of importance in XAI have drawn significant interest, with important limitations being uncovered in recent work (Marques-Silva and Huang 2024; Huang and Marques-Silva 2024).\nHowever, despite the growing number of domains where measures of relative importance have been studied, in each case a dedicated formulation has been proposed. In turn, this does not reveal possible connections between uses of measures of importance in different domains, nor does it suggest how the same measures can be applied to other domains. More importantly, as this paper underlines, measures of importance can readily be envisioned in different practical applications, not being apparent how such measures might be devised. For example, in model-based diagnosis (Reiter 1987), one may be interested in ranking the components of a system in terms of their relevancy for some observed faulty behavior. Similarly, in the case of inconsistent systems of linear inequalities (Van Loon 1981), one may want to assign relative importance (for inconsistency) to the inequalities. In a more general setting, the computation and enumeration of minimal sets (of a reference set N) over a monotone predicate (MSMP) has made significant progress in recent years (Marques-Silva, Janota, and Belov 2013; Marques-Silva, Janota, and Menc\u00eda 2017; Berryhill, Ivrii, and Veneris 2018; Bend\u00edk et al. 2022). However, no solution has been proposed to assign relative importance to the elements of N.\nAs a result, as shown later in the paper, many more use cases of measures of relative importance can be envisioned.\nIn contrast to earlier works, this paper proposes a different take on devising measures of relative importance. Concretely, the paper shows that the best-known measures of importance can be computed for any reference set whenever one is given a monotonically increasing predicate that partitions the subsets of that reference set. As a consequence, the paper also proves that measures of importance can be devised in several domains, for some of which such measures have not yet been studied nor proposed. Although the observations made in the paper could be perceived as plain by some, it is also the case that such observations are not readily apparent to many practitioners, as the rediscovery of the same ideas in different settings demonstrates. Moreover, the paper also summarizes additional application domains, for which the use of relative measures of importance is outlined. The paper also glances through the exact computation of measures of importance, as well as their approximation in practice. Finally, the paper highlights research directions related with computing measures of importance in novel application domains."}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "The notation used in the paper is adapted from the one used in several earlier works (Marques-Silva, Janota, and Belov 2013; Slaney 2014; Marques-Silva, Janota, and Menc\u00eda 2017)."}, {"title": "Sets, predicates & monotonicity", "content": "The following sets are assumed: (i) N = {1,2,...,m}, the set of elements that we consider; and (ii) B = {0,1}, denoting the outcomes of predicates.

A monotone predicate is increasing when \u2709 = >, and decreasing when \u2709 = <.

In contrast to the original definitions, which require that all possible subsets be analyzed, the modified definitions only require a number of subsets linear on the size of the target set to be analyzed. Moreover, MBPs are the complements of maximal sets for the complemented predicate. A natural analogy are MUSes, MCSes and MSSes in the case of inconsistent formulas (Marques-Silva and Menc\u00eda 2020).\nThe set of MSPs is defined by M = {X \u2286 N | MSP(X)}.

However, as this section illustrates, the concept of explanation, as used in XAI, also finds many other practical uses."}, {"title": "Measures of importance", "content": "Although the general MSMP framework proposed in earlier works was analyzed in some detail, covering a number of important properties and also algorithms for the computation and enumeration of (subset- or cardinality-) minimal sets, what has not been studied are measures of importance for the elements of N, regarding whether or not the predicate P holds. (The existing exceptions for specific applications include those mentioned in the related work section, but each one specific to its application domain.) We now show that several well-known measures of importance can be defined in the general case of monotonically increasing predicates, and so are applicable to a wide range of practical domains.\nGiven the characteristic function used in the case of power indices (see (1)), but also in other domains, the following characteristic function is proposed:\nv(S) := ITE(P(S), 1,0) \nwhich can be stated, alternatively, as follows:\u00b9 v(S) := ITE(\u2203(Z \u2208 M).Z \u2286 S, 1,0). Given that the codomain of v is B and that v is monotonically increasing (because P is monotonically increasing), then we are effectively reformulating MSMP as a simple game (Chalkiadakis, Elkind, and Wooldridge 2012) with the goal of assigning relative importance to the elements of N.\nUsing (2), we define \u2206(S) = \u2211\u1d62\u2208S (\u2206\u1d62(S)), thus denoting the relative influence of S \u2286 N. Moreover, it is the case that \u2206(S) \u2265 0, since v is monotonically increasing. Given that v(S) \u2208 {0, 1}, and that v is monotonically increasing, then one must either have \u2206\u1d62(S) = 1 or \u2206\u1d62(S) = 0. Finally, for \u2206\u1d62(S) = 1, it must be the case that v(S) = 1 and v(S \\ {i}) = 0.\nAn element i \u2208 N is critical for a set S \u2286 N to be a set for P if,\u00b2\nCrit\u209b(i, S) := P(S) \u2227 \u00acP(S \\ {i})\nThus, we have the following immediate result:\nProposition 2. Given the definition of v, \u0394\u1d62(S) = 1 if and only if Crit\u209b(i, S).\nEssentially, \u0394\u1d62(S) = 1 for the elements i \u2208 N that are critical for S to be a set for P. Furthermore, we could also consider an element i \u2208 N to be critical for a set S \u2286 N to be a break for P. Critical elements have also been indirectly considered in later works (Hunter and Konieczny 2006, 2010; Amgoud, Ben-Naim, and Vesic 2017), due to the choice of characteristic function. The following result follows from the definition of minimal sets and critical element:\nProposition 3. For an MSP M \u2286 N, each element of M is critical for M to be a set for P. For an MBP B \u2286 N, each element of B is critical for B to be a break for P.\nTaking into consideration the definitions above, and the fact that the proposed characteristic function mimics the one used in specific domains, we can now redefine all of the best-known power indices in the case of monotonically increasing predicates. These will be referred to as Uninstantiated Measures of Importance (UMIs), to reflect the framework in which the indices are defined.\nAn (uninstantiated) measure of importance Im is a mapping from the elements of N to the reals, Im: N \u2192 R. Different UMIs can be envisioned, and so for a given UMI t, Im is qualified with t, i.e., Im\u1d57. Thus, the Shapley-Shubik (Shapley and Shubik 1954) (Im\u209b), Banzhaf (Banzhaf III 1965) (Im\u1d2e), and Deegan-Packel (Deegan and Packel 1978) (Im\u1d3e) UMIs are defined as follows:\nIm\u209b(i) := \u2211\u209b\u2286N Crit\u209b(i, S) (1/(|N| \u00d7 (|S|-1)! (|N|-|S|)!))\nIm\u1d2e(i) := \u2211\u209b\u2286N Crit\u209b(i, S) (1/2|N|-1)\nIm\u1d3e(i) := \u2211\u209b\u2208M/i (1/(|S| \u00d7 |M|))\nwhere the values of s depend on each case, as introduced in (3). Furthermore, Im\u1d2e can optionally be normalized (Dubey and Shapley 1979) so that its sum over all the"}, {"title": "Case Studies", "content": "This section shows how measures of importance can be computed for the two running examples of the paper."}, {"title": "Dominating sets", "content": "The UMIs described before can be instantiated to measure the importance of each vertex in dominating the graph considered in the first running example. Recall that the set of vertices is N = {1,2,3,4} and the minimal dominating sets are M = {{1,4}, {2,4}, {3}}. In this concrete case, the characteristic function is v(S) := ITE(DSet(S), 1,0), with S \u2286 N.\nThe measures of importance are shown in Table 1 (rounded to three decimal places). As can be observed, Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf yield similar results: 3 is deemed the most relevant vertex, followed by 4, and 1 and 2 tie as the least important ones. In contrast, Deegan-Packel assigns the same importance to vertices 3 and 4.\nTo illustrate the previous definitions, vertex 3 is critical for D = {1,2,3} to be a dominating set, since D is a dominating set but D \\ {3} = {1, 2} is not. However, vertex 2 is not critical for D since D \\ {2} = {1,3} is still a dominating set. So, Crit\u209b(3, {1, 2, 3}) holds and Crit\u209b(2, {1, 2, 3}) does not.\nThe computation of the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices depends on the sets for which a given vertex i\u2208 N is critical. As an example, vertex 4 is critical for three sets: {1,2,4}, {1,4} and {2,4}. Hence, {S \u2286 N | Crit\u209b(4, S)} = {{1, 2, 4}, {1,4}, {2,4}}. In this case, the Shapley-Shubik value is computed as Im\u209b(4) = (1/(4\u00d7(3))) + (1/(4\u00d7(3))) + (1/(4\u00d7(3))) = 3/12 = 0.250. The Banzhaf index is Im\u1d2e(4) = 1/2\u00b3 + 1/2\u00b3 + 1/2\u00b3 = 3/8 = 0.375. This value is normalized as Im\u1d2e\u207f(4) = 0.300 to achieve a total sum of 1 accross all the elements of N. On the"}, {"title": "Sardaukar training", "content": "For Running example 2, it is clear that failing exercise 6 is never critical for a trainee to be terminated. Similarly, only if exercise 1 is failed can a trainee be terminated. For example, it is plain to conclude that Crit\u209b(1, {1,2,3,4,5,6}) holds. However, Crit\u209b(1, {1, 4, 5, 6}) does not hold. For each exercise i, we can find the sets S \u2286 N for which i is critical. As a result, we can compute the UMIs proposed in the previous section.\nThe results are summarized in Table 2. As noted earlier, for Deegan-Packel only the minimal sets are considered; in this case each exercise in each minimal set is also critical for that set. The values for exercise 6 should be unsurprising. As argued earlier, exercise 6 is referred to as irrelevant in XAI (Marques-Silva and Huang 2024), or as dummy in a priori voting power (Lucas 1983).\nFinally, as already observed in the first running example, the relative importance of the different exercises is not always the same. For this example, and for Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf, the obtained relative importances are the same. However, for Deegan-Packel it changes, with exercise 3 deemed more important than exercise 2. It is debatable which ranking of exercises should be deemed the most adequate. However, in different domains of application, the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices find a much larger range of uses."}, {"title": "Example Application Areas", "content": "Besides the two case studies and the application domains already discussed in the paper, both MSMP and measures of importance for MSMP find a wide range of applications.

One example are minimal unsatisfiable subsets and minimal correction subsets, but one can also account for their many generalizations, including fragments of first order logic. Moreover, (Eiter and Gottlob 2002; Eiter, Makino, and Gottlob 2008; Gainer-Dewar and Vera-Licona 2017) discuss other related examples. In addition, (Gusev 2020, 2023) lists several practical uses related with set covering. The measures of importance proposed in this paper can be applied to any of these examples. Furthermore, examples from other different domains can also be identified.

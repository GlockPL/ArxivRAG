INTRODUCTION", "content": "Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a critical medical condition, involves the hemorrhage within the digestive tract encompassing the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. This pathological state presents a spectrum of risks, from immediate life-threatening emergencies to long-term detrimental consequences [1], [2]. The severity of GI bleeding ranges from asymptomatic microhemorrhages detectable only by laboratory tests to significant visible bleeding, manifesting in stool or vomit, potentially culminating in fatal outcomes. The emergence of GI bleeding stems from various underlying conditions, including peptic ulcers, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and colorectal cancer, each contributing to the complexity and danger of this condition. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the gravity of this issue, attributing approximately 300,000 annual deaths worldwide to GI bleeding [3]. These daunting statistics underscore the need for continued research and innovation in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.\nGI bleeding is broadly classified into upper and lower GI bleeding, each with distinct characteristics and implications [4]. Upper GI bleeding, more prevalent than its lower counterpart primarily originates from the upper digestive tract [5]. The incidence of upper GI bleeding ranges from 50 to 150 cases per 100,000 population annually [6], disproportionately affecting older individuals [7]. Mortality rates for upper GI bleeding lie between 6% to 10%, reflecting its significant health impact [8]\u2013[10]. Conversely, lower GI bleeding, with an annual incidence of 20-27 episodes per 100,000 persons, has a slightly lower mortality rate of 4%-10% [11], [12]. Acute GI bleeding, a significant cause of hospital admissions in the United States, is estimated at 300,000 patients annually [13], [14]. The clinical presentation of GI bleeding can be overt, such as hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or occult, often detected through positive fecal occult blood tests or iron deficiency anemia [15]. The complexity extends to obscure GI bleeding, where the bleeding source remains unidentified after standard endoscopic evaluations [16], [17].\nDiagnostic modalities for GI bleeding have evolved, with endoscopy being the primary method for upper GI bleeding [18]. It involves direct visualization of the GI tract to identify bleeding sources. However, the advent of Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) marks a significant advancement. This method has shown a higher diagnostic yield in patients with chronic occult and obscure GI bleeding compared to push enteroscopy and barium studies [19]. VCE, a non-invasive and painless procedure, involves swallowing a small, wireless capsule containing a camera that captures frames as it travels through the digestive tract. It provides a comprehensive visualization of the small intestine, which is not easily accessible by traditional endoscopy methods. It offers the advantage of minimal or no hospitalization and specialized care. It does not require sedation, and the capsule is naturally excreted from the body. It plays a crucial role in identifying the source and location of bleeding. Thus, it can help in detecting lesions, ulcers, tumors, abnormal blood vessels, and other abnormalities [20]. In developed countries, VCE is being utilized as the first line of treatment for the management of GI conditions. However, the process of developing a differential diagnosis based on the 6-8 hours of video captured is time-consuming. The evaluation of anomalies in a frame-by-frame manner requires expertise and is susceptible to human error. Moreover, due to the movement of the camera along the GI tract, there are challenges such as poor lighting, motion artifacts, blurring, and the possibility of missed abnormalities at the camera's rear side [21]. Hence, automation in VCE can streamline the process by providing standardized and objective analysis. It saves the time of healthcare professionals, enabling faster diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, it enhances detection accuracy and minimizes the rate of false positives or false negatives [22].\nThese challenges have catalyzed interest in employing Machine Learning (ML) for the automatic classification, detection, and segmentation of GI bleeding in VCE. ML advancements promise improved accuracy, faster diagnostic processes, and reduced human error. This review paper examines the current ML methodologies for automatic bleeding detection in VCE, assessing their effectiveness, challenges, and future directions. It analyzes 113 papers published between 2008 and 2023, with Figure 1 depicting the year-wise distribution of these studies, highlighting the growing interest and research efforts in this field."}, {"title": "A.

Existing Reviews", "content": "This section details several relevant review articles aimed at summarizing techniques for detecting bleeding in VCE frames. The section also attempts to explain the limitations of these review articles by bench-marking them with our presented review. Extensive reviews have addressed the need for ML algorithms in automatic bleeding classification, detection, and segmentation in VCE in a timely manner. Increasing scientific advancements in image processing methods, ML, transfer learning (TL), and DL in bleeding classification, detection, and segmentation in VCE frames have been observed in [23]\u2013[27].\nBrzeski et al. (2013) [23] conducted a comprehensive analysis of existing methods for detecting bleeding in VCE, emphasizing image processing techniques utilized in algorithms. They categorized these techniques into various groups: Color-based, Texture-based, Contour-based, Segmentation, Decision, and Other. The authors concluded that algorithms may need broader techniques to address visual features in endoscopic bleeding. While Brzeski et al.'s analysis provides valuable insights into image processing methodologies, their review lacks coverage of DL techniques specifically applied to bleeding detection in VCE. Additionally, there is no discussion on datasets commonly used in DL models for bleeding detection or the comparative analysis between DL and traditional image processing methods in this context. Du et al. (2019) [25] provided an extensive review of the application of DL methods in the analysis of GI frames. The paper outlined various DL architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), supervised architectures like LeNet, AlexNet, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet), GoogleNet, Residual Network (ResNet), unsupervised architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and others. The review covered existing works on classification, detection, and segmentation related to GI diseases, including polyps, hemorrhages, GI cancer, and GI disease analysis. The findings highlighted polyps as the most extensively studied GI disease, with GI cancer being the second most explored. The authors found that CNN-based supervised learning networks currently dominate the landscape of deep models in GI frame processing. The authors suggested areas for further exploration, including developing a 3D-CNN-based DL diagnostic system and exploring other DL methods, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Although Du et al.'s review offers a detailed overview of DL methods in GI frame analysis, it lacks a specific focus on bleeding detection in VCE.\nRahim et al. (2020) [24] conducted a review focusing on computer-aided detection (CAD) methods utilizing VCE frames. The primary objective was to classify these frames as either diseased/abnormal or disease-free/normal, specifically targeting bleeding, tumors, polyps, and ulcers. The survey encompasses a comprehensive analysis of various studies, providing detailed insights into their methodologies, findings, and conclusions. The authors noted that no existing research has addressed the joint classification of all three anomalies. Thus, they proposed an innovative approach for the concurrent classification of tumors, polyps, and ulcers in VCE videos. This proposed method employs a cascaded approach of neural networks, and the paper includes pertinent information on the experimental setup, the dataset used, and the obtained results. While Rahim et al.'s review provides insights into CAD methods in VCE, it lacks coverage of DL techniques and their application, specifically in bleeding detection. Additionally, there is no discussion on the comparative analysis between DL and traditional image processing methods in bleeding detection or future research directions in this field. Soffer et al. (2020) [26] presented the findings of a systematic review of the current literature for DL implementation in VCE. The work provides a succinct overview of the characteristics of articles included in a quantitative meta-analysis, specifically focusing on clinical applications, dataset sizes, and network performance, particularly on ulcers and bleeding. By examining existing research, CNN is concluded to show remarkable performance in abnormality detection, with accuracy consistently exceeding 90% in most studies. Quantitative analysis showed high pooled sensitivities and specificities for the detection of ulcers, bleeding, or the detection of the source of bleeding. Although the systematic review by Soffer et al. offers valuable insight into DL implementation in VCE, it lacks a detailed discussion of bleeding detection techniques, challenges, and future research directions specific to this application. Additionally, there is no coverage of datasets commonly used in DL models for bleeding detection or comparative analysis with traditional image processing methods.\nMusha et al. (2023) [27] conducted a systematic review of CAD bleeding algorithms in VCE. The study aimed to identify a taxonomy for these algorithms, discuss prevalent methods, and pinpoint the most effective ones for practical use. The researchers categorized the existing literature into three tasks, i.e., classification, segmentation, and combined classification and segmentation. The combined task proved to be the most effective, with the highest accuracy and specificity. In the review, various color spaces were divided into four groups, i.e., RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation, value), combined (multiple color spaces), and other (YIQ (Luminance (Y), In-phase (I), Quadrature (Q)), YCbCr (Luma (Y), Blue Chroma (Cb), Red Chroma (Cr)), etc.). As per the review above, the selected color space did not offer any performance advantages for the classification or segmentation tasks except RGB, which showed slightly higher recall and lower variance. Combining global and local feature extraction yielded better accuracy. The research findings reveal that for ML, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and neural network algorithms were commonly used, while CNNs dominated DL. Although KNN and CNN outperformed other algorithms, KNN faced limitations like overfitting and reliance on hand-crafted features.\nIn the above review, the chosen color space did not provide any performance benefits for the classification or segmentation tasks. The study highlighted the growing focus on DL algorithms, particularly CNNs, for bleeding detection and emphasized the need to address dataset limitations by using synthetic VCE frames. Challenges include minimizing computational requirements and ensuring visually interpretable outcomes for clinician trust. While Musha et al.'s systematic review provides valuable insights into bleeding detection algorithms in VCE, it lacks coverage of DL techniques and their application specifically in VCE. Additionally, there is no discussion on datasets commonly used in DL models for bleeding detection or comparative analysis with traditional image processing methods. By addressing these gaps, our review offers a comprehensive understanding of bleeding detection in VCE, covering all research questions listed in Table I and providing valuable insights into DL techniques, datasets, challenges, and future research directions in this field."}, {"title": "C.

OPEN SOURCE DATASETS FOR ABNORMAL BLEEDING DETECTION IN VCE FRAMES", "content": "In the field of VCE, datasets play a significant role. The development and validation of DL models require a diverse set of datasets with varied characteristics. Researchers in the field of VCE bleeding detection employ various datasets, each with unique features [29]. While some of these datasets are publicly accessible, others are restricted due to privacy and proprietary concerns. Open Source datasets contribute to collaborative advancement in medical research while maintaining transparency [30]. This section is an overview of publicly available datasets that facilitate the recent developments in bleeding detection using VCE.\nBleeding as an abnormality was first introduced in the KID Project [31]. It was developed to advance the medical research support systems (MDSS) for VCE. Clinicians annotated VCE frames and videos. Six centers contributed 2500 annotated VCE frames and 47 videos, which included vascular lesions that covered angioectasias and/or bleeding. KID dataset produced semantic and graphic image annotations supported by an open-access annotation tool. Kvasir-Capsule [32], the largest publicly available PillCAM dataset, contains 4,741,504 frames extracted from 117 videos, out of which 47,238 frames are medically verified, and are labeled with bounding box. It contains 14 different classes. Under the luminal findings section, there are two classes: blood-fresh, for the liquid red appearance of the bleeding in the upper GI tract or small bowel, and blood-hematin, for the cases of minimal bleeding where small black stripes may be observed. But, in both these datasets, bleeding is observed as a coexisting abnormality.\nRed Lesion Endoscopy (RLE) Dataset [33] contains 2 subsets of anonymized VCE frames with annotated red lesions. The first folder has 3,295 non-sequential frames with different red lesions, such as angioectasias, angiodysplasias, bleeding, and others, which total 1,311 frames. The second folder has 600 sequential frames, out of which 73% of frames have red lesions, each one labeled manually as Blood/Non-Blood. All frames in both folders are 320\u00d7320 pixels wide. The Bleeding dataset by Farah Deeba [34] was released in 2016 and contains 50 bleeding frames and 50 non-bleeding frames, along with ground truth frames and annotations. The limitation of this dataset was that its size does not reflect the practical cases of generating huge numbers of frames in VCE. Endoscopy Recommendation System (ERS) Dataset [35] is a multi-label image dataset that contains frames from flexible endoscopy, colonoscopy, and Capsule Endoscopy (CE). The frames are labeled according to Minimal Standard Terminology 3.0 (MST 3.0). This dataset comprises 104 medical labels and 19 ML application labels, divided into 5 categories: healthy, blood, quality, gastro, and colono. WCE-BleedGen Dataset [36] primarily focuses on bleeding and non-bleeding frames. It consists of multiple bleeding frames from internet resources with different types of GI bleeding. It also contains medically validated binary masks and bounding boxes in You Only Look Once (YOLO)-txt, XML, and txt formats.\nAuto-WCEBleedGen dataset [36] contains independently collected bleeding and non-bleeding frames of more than 30 patients suffering from acute, obscure, and occult GI bleeding referred to the Department of Gastroenterology and HNU, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. It is divided into two subsets -one containing 49 frames from 7 patients with marked and unmarked annotations, and the second has 514 frames from 23 patients with known class labels but no marked annotations. The Gastrointestinal Bleeding WCE images Dataset [37] comprises VCE frames focused on GI bleeding, sourced from Turkey Hospital Muzaffargarh (THM) in Pakistan. Collected between January 2022 and May 2022, it contains 226 GI frames. Among these, 113 frames represent instances of GI bleeding or lesions, while the remaining 113 frames capture VCE visuals from normal patients. Auto-WCEBleedGen and GI Bleeding WCE frames datasets have not been used in any manuscripts, but they focus on GI bleeding as a primary abnormality."}, {"title": "IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEASURES", "content": "In the realm of GI bleeding detection through traditional and ML techniques, a variety of evaluation metrics are employed to assess the performance and reliability of the models.

This section elaborates on the key metrics used in the literature."}, {"title": "A. Statistical Metrics", "content": "1) Mean: The mean, commonly known as the average, is a measure of central tendency in a dataset and is calculated by summing all numerical values and dividing this sum by the count of values [38]. The mean's range can vary widely depending on the dataset. In the context of medical imaging, such as VCE, the mean is used to determine the average pixel intensity across a set of frames, aiding in tasks like normalization or contrast adjustment in the pre-processing stages of model development. It is represented by\n$\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n}$    (1)\n2) Variance: Variance is a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a dataset, where a high variance indicates a large spread of data points around the mean, and a low variance indicates a tight clustering of data points [38]. In VCE, variance can indicate the diversity in the dataset, such as variations in lighting, texture, and color, which can significantly impact the model's learning process. The variance is calculated using\n$\\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\text{Mean})^2}{n}$      (2)\n3) Kurtosis: Kurtosis is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a dataset [38]. High kurtosis means that the data have heavy tails or outliers; low kurtosis means that the data are light-tailed or lack outliers.

Its range can be from zero to positive infinity. In the realm of VCE, the standard deviation helps in understanding the variability in image features, which may affect the consistency and reliability of bleeding detection models. The formula for the standard deviation is given by\n$SD = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\text{Mean})^2}{n}}$      (4)"}, {"title": "B.

The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (1-Specificity), and the AUC ranges from 0 to 1 [42], with a higher value indicating better model performance. In VCE, the AUC provides a comprehensive measure of the model's ability to distinguish between bleeding and non-bleeding cases across different thresholds.\n6) False Positive Ratio (FPR): The False Positive Ratio is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive [43]. It is a measure of the rate at which false alarms occur. In VCE, a lower FPR is desirable as it indicates fewer healthy patients being incorrectly diagnosed with bleeding, which is essential for patient safety and trust in the diagnostic process.\n$\\text{FPR} = \\frac{\\text{False Positives}}{\\text{True Negatives + False Positives}}$    (9)\n7) False Negative Ratio (FNR): The False Negative Ratio is the proportion of positive cases that are wrongly classified as negative. It is critical in medical diagnostics as it represents missed diagnoses. In VCE bleeding detection [43], a high FNR would mean failing to identify actual bleeding cases, which could have serious implications for patient health.\n$\\text{FNR} = \\frac{\\text{False Negatives}}{\\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}$     (10)\n8) F1 Score: The F-Measure, also known as the F1 Score, is a harmonic mean of precision and recall [44].

It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure that can be used even when the classes are of very different sizes. The MCC ranges from -1 to +1 [44], where +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation. The MCC is defined as\n$\\text{MCC} = \\frac{TP \\times TN - FP \\times FN}{\\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}}$ (12)\nwhere TP, TN, FP, and FN represent the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.\n10) Negative Predictive Value (NPV) : NPV is the ratio of true negatives to total predicted negatives.

Segmentation and Object Detection Metrics", "content": "1) Jaccard Index: The Jaccard Index, also known as the Intersection over Union (IoU), is a widely used metric in various fields, including medical image analysis, to compare the similarity and diversity of sample sets [49]. In the context of VCE bleeding detection, it measures how well the predicted bleeding areas overlap with the actual bleeding areas. The formula for the Jaccard Index is given by\n$\\text{Jaccard Index} = \\frac{A \\cap B}{A \\cup B}$   (17)\nIn this formula, $A \\cap B$ represents the intersection of the two sets A and B, which in the context of medical imaging would be the area where both the predicted bleeding region and the actual bleeding region overlap. $|A \\cup B|$ is the union of the two sets A and B, which is the total area covered by both the predicted and actual bleeding regions combined. The Jaccard Index ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no overlap between the predicted and actual regions (no similarity), and 1 indicates perfect overlap (complete similarity).\n2) Dice Score (DS): The Dice Score, also known as the Dice Similarity Coefficient, is a measure of overlap between two samples. This statistic [50] is widely used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The Dice Score is calculated by\nDice Score (DS) = $\\frac{2 \\times |A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B|}$    (18)\nwhere A and B are the predicted and actual segmentation regions, respectively. The Dice Score ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).\n3) Mean Intersection over Union (mIOU): MIOU is an extension of the IoU metric, used primarily in multi-class segmentation tasks [51]. It calculates the IoU for each class and then averages them. This provides a more comprehensive measure for models predicting multiple classes. The formula for mIOU is given by\n$MIOU = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} IoU_i$  (19)\nwhere N is the number of classes, and $IoU_i$ is the IoU for the ith class.\n4) Average Precision: Average Precision (AP) is a widely used metric in object detection and segmentation tasks, particularly in datasets where instances are annotated with bounding boxes or segmentation masks [52]. AP summarizes the precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precision's achieved at each threshold, emphasizing the performance at different recall levels. The range of AP is from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model performance.\n5) Mean Overlap Coefficient: The Mean Overlap Coefficient is a metric used to assess the similarity and overlap between two datasets or frames [53]. The range of the Mean Overlap Coefficient is between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no overlap and 1 signifies complete overlap or perfect agreement between the segmented results and the ground truth.\nMean Overlap Coefficient = $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{|A_i \\cap B_i|}{|A_i \\cup B_i|}$   (20)\nIn this formula, N is the number of observations or samples, $A_i$ and $B_i$ represent the two sets (or segmented regions) for the i-th observation, and || denotes the cardinality of the set."}, {"title": "V. OVERVIEW OF TECHNIQUES IN PAPERS CONDUCTING BLEEDING ANALYSIS", "content": "In this section, a comprehensive review of the techniques employed in recent studies focusing on bleeding detection in VCE frames is undertaken. Bleeding detection in VCE frames is considered a critical task in GI disease diagnosis, with applications ranging from early detection to treatment monitoring. To effectively organize the review, the reviewed articles are categorized into four distinct subsections based on their primary focus: Classification, Segmentation, Classification and Segmentation, and Detection. In the Classification subsection, papers focus solely on classifying bleeding frames in VCE frames. Segmentation papers concentrate on delineating bleeding regions within the frames. Those falling under Classification and Segmentation combine both tasks, while papers categorized under Detection primarily focus on identifying bleeding regions. The objective is to provide a detailed analysis of the novelty, methodologies, and results achieved by these papers, offering insights into the current state-of-the-art techniques in the field. This information is complemented by chord charts illustrating the relationships between authors and techniques within each subsection, as well as a comprehensive table detailing the techniques employed, datasets utilized, and the corresponding results achieved by each paper, along with the year of publication. Additionally, a taxonomy is included in the Fig. 6, referencing each paper under the technique the authors have implemented in that paper. Through this review, a deeper understanding of the advancements and trends in bleeding detection methodologies within the VCE imaging domain is aimed to be facilitated.\nBleeding classification in VCE frame analysis has evolved from early range ratio color condition methods to using color texture feature extraction techniques in RGB and HSI color spaces. Over time, CNNs gained prominence for feature extraction, while classifiers such as SVM were employed for classification alongside other GI anomalies like polyps, tumors, and ulcers. A recent work has integrated blockchain security with CNN for bleeding classification in VCE frames, marking a significant advancement in medical image analysis. The classification pipeline, as shown in the Fig. 7, involves pre-processing steps such as reshaping, resizing, BorderLine Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (BL-SMOTE), and data augmentation to handle imbalanced datasets. Feature extraction methods encompass color histogram, color moments, texture features (Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Visual Bag of Features (VBOF)), and space feature extraction (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), bleeding spot shapes). Metaheuristic algorithms like Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA), Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) were also employed to optimize feature extraction. Extracted features are then inputted into classifiers (SVM, MLP, Random Forest (RF) etc.) for bleeding classification. Some works employed end-to-end DL architectures like CNNs, handling the entire classification pipeline within the CNN framework.\nFor the purpose of segmentation of bleeding regions in VCE frames, research has developed from color and texture-based methods to advanced DL algorithms for bleeding region annotation. Some highlights in this domain include the implementation of super-pixel segmentation techniques, dual networks for accurately localizing bleeding regions, and the use of GPU-based parallel programming for reduced computational power. In the domain of detection of bleeding frames, i.e., classification, followed by segmentation of bleeding regions in VCE frames, research began by increasing algorithm proficiency using techniques like saliency maps and classifier fusion algorithms. In recent years, there has been advancement with the implementation of block-based statistics, pixel-based feature extraction, and the introduction of DL algorithms such as VCENet. After reviewing all these techniques, we have presented a generalized segmentation pipeline in Fig. 8 that includes pre-processing of the input image, followed by feature extraction based on color, texture, or spatial characteristics. Then, pixel-level classification of bleeding regions is applied, after which DL methods such as CNN or MLP are usually employed for accurate segmentation. This is sometimes followed by post-processing with morphological operations to enhance the segmentation results.\nIn the last decade, the application of detection of bleeding regions in VCE frames has witnessed significant advancements with the implementation of CNN and various other DL algorithms in this domain. The latest studies have focused on introducing DL models and improving currently released algorithms to increase the level of visual features extracted from VCE frames for detecting pathologies, including bleeding. One of the articles reviewed in this paper applied the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm for detecting Multiple Bleeding Spots (MBS), while another improved upon a previously applied CNN architecture for detecting multiple pathologies to localize bleeding regions. Typically the detection pipeline includes a sequential process for identifying bleeding anomaly in frames, encompassing preprocessing, feature extraction, region proposal, feature fusion, detection, localization, post-processing, and model evaluation, ultimately outputting classified and localized instances of bleeding."}, {"title": "A.

This paper presents a novel framework leveraging video diffusion models, a type of generative artificial Intelligence (AI), for inverse multi-material design based on nonlinear stress-strain responses.

It offers a promising solution for generating next-generation metamaterials with finely tuned mechanical characteristics.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The concept of producing artificial materials with customized characteristics has become increasingly popular in many engineering fields since additive manufacturing allows for the fabrication of architected materials, also known as metamaterials, at various scales and sizes [1]. Unique mechanical properties of metamaterials, such as how they bend, stretch, compress, or respond to forces, come from the material's internal structure, often made up of repeating geometric patterns of multiple conventional materials. Opposite to the restricted range of natural bulk materials, engineers and designers now have the opportunity to explore the significantly broadened design and property possibilities of metamaterials. These materials have been specifically developed to accomplish mechanical properties and behaviors that were previously unattainable, such as in impact energy absorption in automotive and aerospace industries [2], soft robotics and actuators that can undergo large and irreversible deformations in response to external loadings [3], and bio-inspired materials for that mimic the nonlinear mechanical properties and behavior of biological tissues for use in tissue engineering or medical implants and prosthetic [4]. Recent advancements in multi-material additive manufacturing have further expanded the possibilities for designing and fabricating complex lattice structures [1]. Such capability allows for more precise control over the mechanical properties and behavior of metamaterials, opening up new avenues for innovative designs and applications.\nHistorically, the forward approaches [5\u20138] were used to systematically modify the design parameters of complex and architected materials until the measured or simulated properties meet specifically defined design requirements. These methods typically need significant prior knowledge of experienced designers, and they are burdened by computationally demanding simulations of iterative experiments, especially for materials exhibiting intricate, nonlinear characteristics. On the other hand, topology optimization (TO) methods, including gradient-based algorithms and genetic algorithms [9\u201312], and traditional non-generative machine learning-based design approaches [13\u201318], as reviewed in [19], have shown potential for achieving desired property values. However, these methods face several challenges when dealing with complex, nonlinear material behaviors. While TO can be extended to various types of nonlinearities [20], such extensions are mathematically rigorous, and their implementation is prone to errors. Additionally, TO methods often struggle with getting trapped in local minima, particularly for highly nonlinear problems. Furthermore, the non-unique mapping between mechanical responses and structural designs, inherent in many metamaterial design problems, poses a significant challenge for these approaches.\nGenerative artificial intelligence models represent a category of artificial intelligence systems engineered to produce novel data that emulates patterns found in existing data. Generative models differ from traditional AI models, primarily focused on recognizing patterns or making predictions based on input data. Instead, generative models seek to produce novel outputs that mimic the training data's characteristics, making them attractive for nonlinear inverse design [21, 22]. Mao et al. [23] used a generative adversarial network (GAN) to design architected materials while Zheng et al. [24] proposed an inverse design method for auxetic metamaterials using a conditional generative adversarial network cGAN. Ma et al. [25] and Wang et al. [26] used a conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate a metamaterial structure with specific mechanical properties. Recently, Ha et al. [27] implemented a generative machine learning (ML) pipeline composed of inverse prediction and forward validation modules.\nAmong generative AI models, diffusion models [28] have shown exceptional achievements in several domains of AI, notably in generating images and videos. Diffusion models are ML methods that gradually transform random noise into meaningful data, like images or videos. Starting with a clear image or a video, the model first adds random noise until it becomes unrecognizable and pure noise. Once the model learns how the noise is added, it reverses the process by gradually denoising it step by step, transforming the noise back into something recognizable and comparing it with its original image or video target. By repeating this training process with many data samples, the model eventually learns to generate new images or videos from random noise data it has never seen before. The newly generated images or videos look realistic and match the patterns learned from the original data. To create images or videos on specific conditional class, Dhariwal and Nichol [29] proposed a classifier guidance method that trains a classifier on noise images and uses the gradient of the classifier to guide the sampling toward the target class. Later, Ho and Salimans [30] proposed a classifier-free guidance method that uses the scores from a conditional diffusion and an unconditional diffusion model, allowing the model to learn to generate fields both conditionally and unconditionally. Such diffusion models have been widely used in current popular AI applications, such as DALL-E-2 [31], DALL-E-3 [32], and Sora [33, 34] developed by OpenAI, Imagen Video [35, 36] by Google Research Brain Team, Stable Diffusion [37\u201339] by Stability AI, Midjourney by Minjourney Inc, and NAI diffusion by NovelAI. Beyond image or video synthesis in these tools, application of conditional diffusion models has expanded recently to encompass disciplines such as design for material science, including molecular design [40-42], single metamaterial architecture design [43-46], superconductors design [47, 48] and many others, where they reveal promise for addressing highly challenging and often unsolvable inverse design problems.\nThis paper presents a novel framework that leverages a video diffusion model that performs inverse multi-material design. Our approach is specifically tailored to generate designs with multiple materials that satisfy a given nonlinear stress-strain response. The application of diffusion models to video data incorporates temporal dynamics, enabling the model to accurately represent the dynamic changes that occur over time, similar to the evolution of deformation paths in nonlinear mechanical quasi-static behavior. The capacity to represent both spatial and temporal relationships renders video diffusion models suitable for challenges involving the evolution of system changes over time, such as in nonlinear deformation under stress. Bastek and Kochmann [43] used this concept, inspired by [35, 36], to design periodic stochastic cellular structures under compression loading in the large-strain hyper-elastic regime, including buckling and contact. However, their landmark work involved a single material, which enabled a simple mapping methodology to predict material distribution from the predicted solution fields. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research work has devised a general diffusion model framework to predict metamaterial designs with multiple materials. Such problem is very important since designers can further fine-tune the metamaterial's overall behavior by using different materials, each with unique mechanical, thermal, or electrical properties. For example, one material might provide stiffness while another offers compliance, allowing for a balance between strength and deformability. In addition, we included plastic deformation, an irreversible behavior common to many materials under large deformation that exceeds yielding. Conversely, this also introduced additional challenges to our diffusion model in learning deformation path-dependent highly nonlinear material behavior."}, {"title": "2. Methods", "content": "2.1. Training data generation\nWe generate truss-like multi-material metamaterials based on random Voronoi tessellations [49]. The initial step involves generating random points in a 2D space and using these points to create finite Voronoi polygons through the Voronoi function in the Python library scipy.spatial. The method constructed Voronoi diagrams, which are then used to extract polygon edges representing the boundaries between regions. Each of these edges is randomly assigned one of three material types, forming the basis of the material distribution. Following this, the polygon edges are thickened. Therefore, each edge becomes a truss-like feature in the design. For simplicity of representing the designs and using the design information as inputs to the diffusion model, the thickened design is then projected to a structured grid to be stored as a 2D array of shape 48\u00d748, where each pixel stores the material ID (0 for void, 1-3 for the three different materials). To construct a symmetric and periodic design, each instantiation is considered as one-quarter of the full design, and the full design is recovered from sequential mirroring along two in-plane directions. The use of random Voronoi tessellations leads to metamaterials with varying relative density, further leading to design space with a wide range of stress-strain responses. Furthermore, this pixel-based representation makes it ideal for use in finite element simulations. Thus, this method provides a flexible approach for generating non-regular, multi-material distributions with varying degrees of complexity, applicable to broad engineering applications.\nOnce the designs are generated, nonlinear implicit dynamic analysis is performed using general purpose finite element analysis (FEA) code [50], solving combined nonlinearities originating from large deformation and plastic material response. As shown in Fig. 1b, designs are placed between two rigid plates, and a quasi-static compression load is applied by moving the top plate and keeping the bottom plate fixed. The structures are compressed to 15% nominal strain. Periodic boundary conditions are enforced in the left and right vertical edges of the structure to obtain a periodic response similar to that observed in long sandwich structure configuration. The materials used in the study are defined using an elastoplastic material model and are commonly used in additive manufacturing applications. The material properties taken from the literature are close to the following materials: PC-ABS [51], thermoplastic acetal homopolymer resin [52], and PLA [53]. In Fig. 1a and throughout this paper, orange represents thermoplastic resin, navy represents PC-ABS, and gray represents PLA. Frictional self-contact was defined with a friction coefficient value of 0.4, and structure nodes at the top and bottom plates were allowed to slip horizontally relative to the horizontal rigid plates. The generated mesh was compatible with the periodic boundary conditions, and four-node bilinear elements (CPE4R) with hourglass control and reduced integration were used. Plain-strain condition is assumed to represent a design extruded in the out-of-plane dimension. Hence, out-of-plane buckling is not considered in this study. The workflow to smooth the design boundaries and generate a conformal mesh from a 2D array of design is adopted from the work of [43].\nThe workflow defined above was used to generate 3314 simulations. All simulations involving physics and finite element analysis were conducted on Delta's High-Performance Computing (HPC) system hosted at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). The CPU nodes of Delta are equipped with AMD EPYC 7763 Milan CPU cores. On average, each simulation required approximately 232 seconds to complete. Using high throughput computing allowed running up to 12 different FE simulations simultaneously. Hence, the total time required for data generation was 18 hours, corresponding to 216 CPU hours. Four output fields are extracted from the result files at 11 equidistant strain increments up to 15% nominal strain. They are the von Mises stress \\(\\sigma_{vM}\\), the axial stress \\(\\sigma_{yy}\\), the strain energy density \\(g_{se} = \\int \\sigma : d\\epsilon\\) and the lateral displacement \\(U_x\\). \\(\\sigma_{vM}\\) is included since it is a commonly used scalar measure for the material stress state, and it is closely related to material yielding. \\(\\sigma_{yy}\\) is included to complement \\(\\sigma_{vM}\\) to indicate whether the material point is under tension or compression. \\(g_{se}\\) is included to further differentiate different materials in different parts of the design. As for the displacements, only \\(U_x\\) is included since the vertical displacement \\(u_y\\) is fixed at the bottom rigid plate locations and does not contain as much information as the former. For simplicity with handling the different FE meshes for different designs, the nodal output fields at the finite element mesh nodes are interpolated to a constant 96\u00d796 pixel grid for all cases. The interpolated fields are stored as 3D arrays each of shape 96\u00d796\u00d74.\n2.2. Neural network framework\nThis section provides an overview of the neural network (NN) models employed in the proposed framework to generate 2D multi-material designs. As illustrated comprehensively in Fig. 2, the framework consists of two primary components: the Gaussian diffusion model (i.e., a fields generator) that learns to generate field contours based on a target force-displacement curve, and the structure identifier (i.e., two UNet models) that identifies the corresponding multi-material 2D design from the generated fields. Each component plays a crucial role in creating novel designs through generative AI and image segmentation."}, {"title": "2.2.1. Diffusion model as a fields generator", "content": "In this work, we adopted a classifier-free guided diffusion model from [43] to generate four mechanical solution fields (i.e., \\(\\sigma_{vM}\\), \\(\\sigma_{yy}\\), \\(g_{se}\\) and \\(u_x\\)), based on the user-provided strain-stress curve. This section provides a brief review of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model [28] and the classifier-free guidance method [30] for completeness.\nGiven a sample \\(x_0\\) from a prior data distribution \\(x \\sim q(x)\\), the forward diffusion process of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model adds a small amount of Gaussian noise to the sample over \\(T\\) steps. This results in a sequence of samples \\(x_1, x_2,..., x_T\\). Each step in the diffusion process is controlled by a variance schedule \\(\\{\\beta_t \\in (0,1)\\}_{t=1}^T\\),\n\n\\(q (x_t|x_{t-1}) = N (x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I),\\)\n\n\\(q (x_{1:T}|x_0) = \\prod_{t=1}^T q (x_t|x_{t-1}).\\)\n\nThe sample \\(x_0\\) gradually loses its features and eventually becomes an isotropic Gaussian distribution for large \\(T\\). This diffusion process has the elegant property that we can sample \\(x_t\\) at any time step \\(t\\) using the reparametrization trick,\n\n\\(x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\epsilon_t,\\)\n\n\\(q (x_t|x_0) = N (x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t) I),\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t\\), \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod_{i=1}^t \\alpha_i\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, I)\\).\n\nBy reversing the diffusion process, we can sample from \\(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)\\) and ultimately generate the true sample \\(x_0\\) from Gaussian noise \\(x_T \\sim N(0, I)\\). Using Bayesian rule, the reverse posterior distribution conditioned on \\(x_0\\) is traced,\n\n\\(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = N (x_{t-1}; \\mu_t (x_t, x_0), \\bar{\\beta}_t I),\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\mu_t (x_t,x_0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} (\\frac{1-\\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}x_t - \\frac{\\beta_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\epsilon_t)\\) and \\(\\bar{\\beta}_t = \\frac{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\beta_t\\).\n\nIn a real generative process, we cannot directly evaluate \\(q (x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)\\) because it requires the entire training samples and the diffusion noise dataset. Instead, we propose a posterior distribution \\(p_\\theta (x_{t-1}|x_t)\\) to approximate the true posterior distribution \\(q (x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)\\),\n\n\\(p_\\theta (x_{t-1}|x_t) = N (x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta (x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta (x_t, t)),\\)\n\nThe reverse denoising process is then controlled by,\n\n\\(p_\\theta (x_{0:T}) = p (x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^T p_\\theta (x_{t-1}|x_t),\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\Sigma_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) is the same as \\(\\beta_t I\\), and \\(\\mu_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) has the same form as \\(\\mu_t (x_t, x_0)\\) but with learnable parameters \\(\\theta\\),\n\n\\(\\mu_\\theta (x_t, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} (x_t - \\frac{1-\\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t))\\).\n\nThe optimization objective of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model is to maximize the log-likelihood \\(\\log p_\\theta (x_{0:T})\\), which results in the following loss function,\n\n\\(L = |\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t) - \\epsilon_t (x_t, t)|^2.\\)\n\nTraining a NN \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) and minimizing the loss function \\(L\\) leads to \\(\\mu_\\theta (x_t,t) \\approx \\mu_t (x_t, x_0)\\), thus making the proposed posterior distribution \\(p_\\theta (x_{t-1}|x_t)\\) close to the true posterior distribution \\(q (x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)\\).\nThe above reverse generative process is random and not controlled by any specific target. In specific design tasks, we aim to generate fields that represent the target, such as the force-displacement curve, which requires training the NN \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) with conditional information. To incorporate the condition information \\(y\\) into the diffusion process, Ho and Salimans [30] proposed a classifier-free guidance method without an explicit classifier [29], incorporating the scores from a conditional diffusion model \\(p_\\theta(x|c)\\) and an unconditional diffusion model \\(p_\\theta(x)\\). The noise estimators \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) of \\(p_\\theta(x)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c = y)\\) of \\(p_\\theta(x|c)\\) are trained in a single NN \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c)\\). Here, \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c = y)\\) is trained with paired data \\((x, c = y)\\), and \\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t)\\) is trained with data \\(x\\) only, i.e., \\((x, c = \\O)\\). During the training process, the condition information \\(c\\) is randomly set as \\(c = \\O\\) or \\(c = y\\) for sample \\((x, y)\\) at different time steps \\(t\\), allowing the model to learn to generate fields both conditionally and unconditionally. During the reverse inference process, \\(\\epsilon_\\theta\\) in Eq. (6) is replaced by the linear summation of conditional and unconditional noise estimators,\n\n\\(\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c) = (1 + w)\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c = y) \u2013 w\\epsilon_\\theta\\epsilon_\\theta (x_t, t, c = \\O),\\)\n\nwhere \\(w \\geq 0\\) is the guidance weight."}, {"title": "2.2.2. Two UNets as a structure identifier", "content": "Similar to the work of [43], the diffusion model generates mechanical solution fields instead of the desired design directly. In addition, due to the stochastic nature of the diffusion process, these raw outputs may contain noise and other imperfections that need to be properly addressed to obtain a physically valid structure. A simple stress threshold is used in [43] to identify the void and solid regions for a single material. This would not work for a multi-material scenario such as the one considered in this work. Therefore, in this work, we proposed to use two consecutive UNets to post-process the fields generated by the diffusion model to obtain the final design: the first one performs a binary segmentation to identify solid and void regions, and the other one performs a multi-class segmentation to identify the material distribution within the solid region. This two-step structure identification process ensures that the final designs are coherent with the designs created initially during the training data generation phase and renders the structure identification process more explainable.\nThe first UNet is designed to perform a binary segmentation on the output fields from the diffusion model. We used the last time step of the Gaussian diffusion outputs from each channel as a training data, since the fields at this final step show the most distinct contrast with void regions. Then it (i.e., the mechanical fields obtained from simulations) was augmented by randomly selecting one in the following list: Random horizontal flip, Random vertical flip, Random rotation by 90 degrees, and Gaussian blur. With data augmentation, the training data was expanded 6 times of its original size to enhance generalizability. To enhance resistance of the model to the inherent noise in the diffusion-predicted field contours, random Gaussian noises were added to the training data field values to resemble the noisy diffusion-generated output, as the diffusion algorithm iteratively adds Gaussian noise in its training phase. Finally, to ensure symmetry in the design, each full-field data (of shape 96 \u00d7 96) was divided into four symmetric parts, four 48 \u00d7 48 images, and stacked along the channel axis. Each part was rotated and flipped to match the orientation of the upper-left slice when stacking. As a result, the channel axis became four times larger than before. The augmented-then-noise-enhanced dataset is used in the training of both UNet models in the structure identifier.\nThe binary segmentation UNet employs an encoder-decoder structure that processes the input to distinguish between material and void regions. The encoder and decoder blocks are constructed out of multiple layers of computation as Fig. 4a and the binary cross entropy loss were used as a loss function. The output from this structure is a binary image with pixels of 48 \u00d7 48, where the material regions are identified against the void background. A schematic of the UNet architecture is shown in Fig. 4b."}, {"title": "3. Results and discussion", "content": "3.1. Diffusion outputs and their noisy nature\nTo evaluate the diffusion model's performance across various mechanical behaviors, nine diverse stress-strain curves were selected from finite element simulation results. These curves, shown in Fig. 6, serve as target behaviors for the framework to reproduce similar designs. Curves 1 and 5 exhibit conventional elasto-plastic behavior with distinct elastic and plastic regions, including strain hardening and softening. Curve 2 displays a significant plateau in the plastic region, indicative of perfect plasticity or a prolonged yielding phase. Curve 3 mirrors the behavior of Curve 2 but at a five-times higher magnitude, testing the framework's ability to scale behaviors. Curves 4 and 9 feature abrupt stress jumps, indicating densification of the structure at larger strains. Curve 6 demonstrates monotonic hardening throughout the strain range, a behavior seen in some composite materials or during certain thermomechanical processes. Curve 7 presents a complex response with two distinct slopes separated by a plateau, potentially representing a material with multiple deformation mechanisms or phase changes. Lastly, Curve 8 showcases a pronounced stress decrease after reaching a maximum, typical of materials exhibiting significant softening due to buckling or fracture. This diverse set of target curves encompasses a wide range of mechanical responses, challenging the framework to reproduce behaviors from conventional plasticity to more complex, non-linear phenomena. Such variety ensures a robust evaluation of the framework's capabilities in mimicking realistic material behaviors.\nThe iterative denoising process within the diffusion model aims to mitigate artifacts and eliminate noise, the raw output often retains residual noise. This noise can impede the structure identifier's ability to accurately discern the lattice design. For example, Fig. 8 illustrates the contrast in noise levels between diffusion model outputs and FEA for the last time step. The figure presents two sets of normalized samples: Fig. 8a shows outputs from the diffusion model, while Fig. 8b displays results from FEA. Visual inspection reveals that the fields generated by the diffusion model exhibit significantly more granularity compared to the smoother, cleaner outputs obtained from FEA. This disparity in image quality underscores the challenges posed by the noise in diffusion model outputs and highlights the need for strategies in countering the residual noise in the prediction for practical applications.\nTo characterize the noise level in the diffusion-generated data, several metrics can be employed to quantify noise within a single image. Typically, measuring noise in an image requires two versions: an original and a noisy version of the same image. However, in our work, there are no \"original\" versions for the diffusion-generated data, as these images are newly created. Therefore, a noise measure that can be computed using just one image is necessary. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) energy [54] was utilized in this work to evaluate a noise in a single image. The DCT energy is obtained by transforming an image using the DCT and summing the absolute values of the transformed pixel values. Since this measure can represent the frequency content of an image, a noise-free image will result low DCT energy value due to its lower-frequency components. Conversely, a noisy image will result a high DCT energy value because noise typically spreads across higher frequencies."}, {"title": "3.2. Performance of the structure identifier", "content": "The structure identifier (i.e., two UNets) were trained and evaluated using an 90-10 split of the dataset into training and test sets. From the 3314 simulations, 332 samples were randomly selected to form the test dataset. The training process consisted up to 500 epochs with stopping early if the test accuracy reaches 99.9%. NN training was executed on an Nvidia A100 GPU. The first UNet took 47 minutes with 53 epochs resulting in an average iteration time of 52.8 seconds, and the second UNet took 3 hours with 178 epochs, having 62.4 seconds on average per iteration."}, {"title": "3.3. FEA validation of designs produced by NNs", "content": "Ensuring that these designs are manufacturable and closely resemble the initial Voronoi designs used during the training data generation phase is crucial. To evaluate the manufacturability and plausibility of designs generated by the diffusion and structure identifier framework, we conducted the finite element analysis identical to that described in Section 2.1. The FEA results, particularly the stress-strain curves, were compared against the original target curves used to guide the diffusion model. For each target curve, 50 designs were generated, resulting in 50 corresponding stress-strain curves from FEA. The similarity between these generated curves and the target curve was assessed to gauge the effectiveness of the generative AI model in inherently mimicking the desired mechanical properties. To quantify the closeness between the generated design curves and their corresponding target curves, we employed the metrics detailed in Eq. (11). Let Ytrue and Ypred represent the target curve and the curves from generated designs, respectively, and S denote the number of points in both curves. As defined in Eq. (11), we utilized the Relative Root Mean Squared Error (RRMSE) and the Relative Mean Absolute Error (RMAE) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the curve similarities. This approach allowed us to objectively assess the performance of our generative model in producing designs that closely match the desired mechanical properties specified by the target curves.\n\n\\(RRMSE(\\%) = \\frac{||Y_{true} - Y_{pred}||_2}{||Y_{true}||_2} \\times 100(\\%) \\)\n\n\\(RMAE(\\%) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^S |Y_{true,i} - Y_{pred,i}|}{\\Sigma_{i=1}^S |Y_{true,i}|} \\times 100(\\%) \\)\n\nThe RRMSE results for all nine target curves are tabulated in Table 4. These results demonstrate that the stress-strain curves derived from the NN-generated designs generally exhibit strong alignment with the target curves. Analysis of the RRMSE for the best-matching designs reveals an average difference of 7.41% and a median difference of 5.20% between the target and generated design curves over all nine target curves. Notably, designs associated with Curve 3 display RRMSE values ranging from 3.77% to 4.06%, indicating a particularly high level of accuracy for this mechanical behavior. However, some curves, such as Curve 9, show higher variability in their generations, with RRMSE values reaching up to 14.2% for the third-best match. These findings suggest that while the generative model performs well in most cases, there is some variation in its accuracy across different mechanical situations. This variability may provide insights into the model's strengths and limitations in replicating specific mechanical properties."}, {"title": "4. Conclusions and future work", "content": "The study presents a promising generative AI framework for multi-material lattice structure designs with tailored target responses. It demonstrates significant potential in fields requiring inverse-design problems, such as impact-resistant structures, additive manufacturing, topology optimization, and biomedical designs. The results show that the model can effectively produce multi-material designs that align with desired nonlinear stress-strain curves, bridging the gap between target performance and manufacturable outputs. While the framework shows considerable promise, areas remain for improvement to ensure consistent accuracy across all mechanical behaviors. We propose the following approaches to enhance the model's reliability and generalizability. First, we suggest to expand the dataset size. It could be advantageous to incorporate a wider range of data that covers more mechanical behaviors and material choices to enhance the generalizability of NNs. Second, one could implement enhanced algorithms for the loss functions in both the diffusion model and the structure identifier, capturing the data to get refined predictions in the inference phase. Third, further improving the fidelity of the input finite element simulations by considering feature-size-dependent material properties induced by the additive manufacturing process employed to manufacture the multi-material structures [56, 57]. Lastly, integrate uncertainty quantification methods. Allowing the framework to predict the uncertainty of its creation by providing confidence intervals for the mechanical properties will enhance decision-making by allowing designers to assess the reliability of the generated designs, identify potential risks, and make informed choices regarding material use and design modifications.\nIn conclusion, this work, for the first time, demonstrates the effectiveness of a generative AI-based approach for creating multi-material designs with desired complex nonlinear mechanical behavior originating from large deformation and plasticity, and offering a significant advancement in computational design for additive and other advanced manufacturing processes.

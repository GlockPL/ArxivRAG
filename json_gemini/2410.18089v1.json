Traditional approaches, which rely on discrete simulations of each mode using single-modal data and simulation, are inadequate for optimizing intermodal and synchromodal systems in a holistic manner. These systems involve complex, interconnected processes that impact shipping time, costs, emissions, and socio-economic factors. Developing digital twins to enable real-time situational awareness, predictive analytics, and optimization of urban logistics systems often demands extensive efforts in knowledge discovery, as well as significant time for integrating various datasets, coupling multi-domain simulations, and developing key software components. Recent advancements in generative AI present new opportunities to create foundational models for scientific research, significantly streamlining the development of digital twins. These models extend traditional digital twins' capabilities by automating the processes of knowledge discovery, data integration, and management to generate innovative simulation and optimization solutions. They also promote autonomous workflows for data engineering, analytics, and software development. This vision paper proposes an innovative paradigm that leverages the power of generative foundation models to enhance digital twins for urban research and operations. Using the decarbonization of the integrated freight transportation as a case study, we propose a conceptual framework that employs recent generative AI advancements, specifically transformer-based language models, to enhance an existing urban digital twin through the development of foundation models. We present preliminary results and share our vision for a more intelligent, autonomous, general-purpose digital twins for optimizing integrate freight transportation system ranged from from multimodal to synchromodal paradigms.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The global freight transportation sector, encompassing road, rail, and waterways, contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for about 11% of global emissions (Staff, 2012). In the United States alone, transportation was responsible for 38% of energy-related emissions in 2021, totaling 4.6 billion metric tons of CO2 (Shirley and Gecan, 2022). These figures highlight the sector's substantial impact on climate change and the urgent need for sustainable approaches to mitigate emissions. Recent disruptions, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, exposed vulnerabilities in freight networks, underscoring the need for resilience and adaptability in logistics (Golan et al., 2020; Dubey et al., 2022). Ensuring robust and efficient supply chains has become essential for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. This requires rethinking freight transportation design and management to better cope with future disruptions, during the process the freight transportation paradigm evolves overtime from the unimodal to multimodal, then to intermodal (Rossolov et al., 2017). In the past decade, the intermodal freight transportation paradigm has become foundational in modern supply chains. It involves moving goods between origin and destination through multiple transport modes, like trucks, trains, and ships, without handling the cargo during transitions (Turbaningsih et al., 2022; Kengpol et al., 2014). By leveraging the strengths of each mode, intermodal freight optimizes efficiency, reduces costs, and minimizes environmental impact, offering significant potential to reduce carbon footprints through improved route planning, shipment consolidation, and the use of more energy-efficient modes, such as rail and waterways (Demir et al., 2019). In very recent years, the concept of synchromodal freight system has been proposed on top of the intermodal freight system with the extended ability for making real-time decisions (Giusti et al., 2019).\n The design and operation of these modern freight transportation paradigm, despite their efficiency, presents numerous methodological challenges that require comprehensive decision-making strategies to optimize transportation between specific Origin-Destination (OD) pairs. Effective approaches involve combining transportation modes to minimize delivery times, reduce costs, and lower GHG emissions while ensuring smooth transitions across diverse socio-economic environments (Aljadiri et al., 2023). Achieving efficiency is hindered by the complexity and uncertainty of logistics, characterized by interconnected dynamics like movement, storage, deconsolidation, consolidation, and intermodal transitions (Lv et al., 2019; Reis and Mac\u00e1rio, 2019). With the progression of the freight transport paradigm from intermodal to synchromodal, these complexities are further complicated by mode-specific constraints, geographic variations, and unpredictable factors such as traffic, extreme weather, and accidents(Demir et al., 2019). Developing a sustainable optimization strategy requires processing large volumes of data, conducting simulations, and employing sophisticated optimization algorithms to select the best combination of modes, routes, and practices from millions of alternatives (Archetti et al., 2022). This process is both complex and time-consuming, necessitating advanced solutions to address the dynamic nature of integrated freight systems.\n In recent years, industry and academia have increasingly adopted digital twin approaches to enhance data- and simulation-driven processes for intermodal and synchromodal optimization. By leveraging advanced ICT and 5G networks, digital twins, virtual replicas of physical systems, allow stakeholders to monitor, simulate, and optimize freight transport operations in real time. Integrating traffic sensors, GPS data, freight simulations, and machine learning models, digital twins help predict disruptions, evaluate operational scenarios, and identify the most efficient strategies, thereby improving resilience, flexibility, and sustainability in supply chains (Busse et al., 2021; Ambra et al., 2019a)."}, {"title": "2. DIGITAL TWINS FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORT", "content": "This section begins by clarifying several similar concepts within the freight transportation system.

Subsequently, recent advancements in generative Al technologies are examined, laying the groundwork for introducing the concept of foundation models"}, {"title": "2.1. Concept Definition", "content": "Before the review, we first define and clarify a few similar logistics paradigms in the freight transportation sector. Within the domain of logistics and supply chain management, multimodal, intermodal, and synchromodal freight transportation are distinct yet interconnected concepts. Multimodal freight transportation refers to the movement of goods using more than one mode of transportation (e.g., truck, rail, sea) under a single contract, but without the seamless integration between different modes, often involving manual intervention for transitions (Dua and Sinha, 2019; Rossolov et al., 2017). Intermodal freight transportation, on the other hand, is characterized by a more coordinated use of different transport modes, where goods are moved in standardized containers across multiple modes under a single journey, optimizing the efficiency of transitions between modes (Pencheva et al., 2022). Synchromodal freight transportation takes the concept further by integrating real-time data and dynamic decision-making, allowing the selection of the most suitable transport mode at each leg of the journey based on current conditions and customer requirements, offering greater flexibility and efficiency compared to the other methods (Ambra et al., 2019b).\n Other freight transportation paradigms include unimodal transportation (involving only one mode of transport), combined transport (specifically focusing on minimizing road usage by shifting to rail or inland waterways for long-distance segments), and co-modal transportation (promoting the efficient combination of transport modes without mode hierarchy) (Yang et al., 2024; Rossolov et al., 2017). Together, these paradigms represent the evolution of freight logistics toward increasingly integrated and adaptive systems to meet modern supply chain needs. As many of these paradigms are progression of the previous paradigm with extended capabilities, this paper proposes an integrated freight transportation paradigm, through the incorporation of the recent generative AI techniques and their exceptional knowledge extraction and reasoning capability, to enable an automated approach that can leverage the knowledge of previous paradigms to formulate adaptive solutions based on the nature and requirement of the real-world decision problems in large scale logistics system."}, {"title": "2.2.

Multimodel Freight Transportation", "content": "Busse et al. (2021) presents a Digital Supply Chain Twin (DSCT) as a comprehensive solution for optimizing complex multimodal supply chains. The DSCT integrates real-time data from logistics actors like freight forwarders, shipping companies, and terminal operators to provide visibility across the supply chain. It simulates scenarios for optimizing resource allocation, mitigating disruptions, and improving decision-making. Utilizing technologies such as IoT, 5G, cloud computing, and AI, the DSCT synchronizes different transport modes, improving efficiency, reducing lead times, and enhancing supply chain resilience and sustainability. Issa et al. (2024) introduces a Digital Twin (DT) for railway systems to support multimodal freight transport. Developed at SNCF R\u00e9seau, the DT provides a real-time representation of railway infrastructure, facilitating synchronization with road, maritime, and inland navigation modes. Integrating a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) allows seamless data sharing among stakeholders such as infrastructure managers and logistics operators.

Synchromodal Freight Transportation", "content": "Ambra et al. (2019a) explores the use of the DT concept to enhance synchromodal freight transportation by reducing uncertainty and enabling more dynamic, flexible logistics operations. The DT acts as a virtual mirror of the physical transportation system, integrating data from various sources, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), sensors, and agent-based models, to create a comprehensive and real-time representation of assets like trucks, trains, and barges. By continuously updating itself based on real-time data, the DT provides a dynamic platform to simulate and predict future system states, which can be used to assess the impact of disruptions and optimize transportation processes. The use of Monte Carlo simulations in the DT enables stakeholders to evaluate potential disruptions, plan re-routing, and assess the performance of different modal options under varying conditions. This integration of real and virtual systems allows the synchromodal freight network to adapt quickly to changes, improving its resilience, reducing lead times, and minimizing costs. The article emphasizes that the DT supports synchromodal decision-making by enhancing situational awareness, facilitating dynamic re-routing, and optimizing modal choices, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and sustainable freight transportation system. Ambra and Macharis (2020) explores the use of Agent-Based Digital Twins (ABM-DT) to support synchromodal freight transportation by fusing virtual and physical environments for optimal decision-making. The Digital Twin (DT) serves as a virtual representation of the physical freight transport system, allowing for real-time integration of different transport modes such as road, rail, and inland waterways. The DT is built using agent-based modeling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), enabling detailed and dynamic simulations of asset movements and transportation processes. The DT concept is applied to bridge the gap between real-time data from physical systems and their virtual counterparts. Real-time data feeds from assets, including vessels and trucks equipped with IoT and GPS, are fed into the digital environment, where they are represented as agents. This connection enables decision-makers to optimize route planning and adapt to disruptions dynamically, improving the overall flexibility and efficiency of the freight transportation system. The integration of these digital and physical elements aims to facilitate a modal shift from road to more sustainable modes like rail and inland waterways, contributing to environmental goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The article demonstrates how the Digital Twin can enhance the decision-making process, provide better transparency, and make the synchromodal transport system more adaptive and resilient to changes."}, {"title": "2.2.4. Knowledge Gap and Opportunities for Improvements", "content": "Many existing digital twins adopt solid software engineering practices, such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and cloud computing, to host essential data and simulations (e.g., agent-based models), creating a virtual replica of real-world freight transportation systems. Despite their value and significance, these digital twins are developed using conventional digital twinning approaches that have several limitations. These limitations can be addressed through the recent advancements in generative AI technologies and the foundation model paradigm, paving the way for next-generation software development.\n Single-Purpose Applications: Traditional digital twin initiatives are heavily rooted in conventional software engineering practices, employing dedicated data analytics, simulations, and optimization techniques within fixed computing environments. Consequently, these digital twins are typically developed as standalone products, tailored to perform specific, predefined functions (e.g., workflows and features) for targeted transportation paradigms, such as multimodal or intermodal freight systems. This approach introduces several limitations: the lack of interoperability with other systems and tools, limited adaptability to decision-making challenges across diverse freight paradigms, and restricted software extensibility. The integration of new methods, datasets, or research developments often demands significant time and effort. These constraints impede scalability and adaptability, highlighting the necessity for a more intelligent and automated approach-one that paves the way for general-purpose or multi-purpose digital twins capable of accommodating a range of freight transportation scenarios.\n Traditional User Interaction: Existing digital twins for freight transportation predominantly utilize Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and predefined user workflows for interaction. These interfaces, while sufficient for executing specific tasks, offer limited flexibility and often require users to possess specialized domain knowledge. User interactions are restricted to a fixed set of buttons, menus, or dashboards, which inherently limits the breadth of queries and actions that can be performed. While effective for structured tasks, this rigid interface design falls short in supporting nuanced user needs or enabling complex, interactive decision-making. Recent advancements in conversational AI, such as chatbots, offer a more dynamic interaction model where users can communicate through natural language-be it text or voice-emulating a human conversation. This fosters open-ended inquiries, personalized responses, and deeper data exploration, empowering users to ask complex questions and receive contextually relevant answers. By bridging the gap between rigid system functionality and intuitive, human-like interactions, conversational AI enhances accessibility and usability, thereby offering a richer, more adaptive decision-making experience.\n Static Data Sources and Limited Dynamic Optimization: Traditional digital twins, built upon conventional software engineering methodologies, generally depend on static, pre-defined datasets, which are inadequate for capturing the dynamic nature of transportation systems. This reliance on static data restricts the ability of these"}, {"title": "2.3. Raise of Generative AI and Foundation Models", "content": "The recent evolution of generative AI models, such as GPT-3, GPT-4, DALL-E, and other transformer-based architectures, has paved the way for building foundation models that are transforming how research is conducted across different scientific disciplines (Yenduri et al., 2024). These generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and synthesizing complex forms of data, whether textual, visual, or multimodal, thus giving rise to the concept of foundation models (Waqas et al., 2023). These models are often large-scale pre-trained AI models that can serve as a versatile base across a wide array of specialized scientific tasks (Zhang et al., 2024b). The power of generative AI in natural language understanding, image synthesis, and data transformation showcases the potential of adapting these models to domain-specific applications. Foundation models harness this power by being trained on expansive, domain-specific datasets and knowledge, ranging from scientific literature, experimental observations, to multimodal research data (Chen et al., 2024; Bommasani et al., 2021). This enables them to act as foundational frameworks that can be fine-tuned or utilized directly to perform critical tasks, including knowledge extraction, data analysis, automated hypothesis generation, simulation, and complex data integration.\n In recent years, foundation models represent a shift from developing bespoke machine learning models for each scientific problem to leveraging a general-purpose model that can be adapted to a multitude of use cases within a given discipline (Bommasani et al., 2021). They learn broad, transferable representations that can be specialized for niche applications, effectively functioning as a robust \"knowledge base\" with an extensive understanding of the data landscape in fields such as medical, climate science, and urban science (Nguyen et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024; Moor et al., 2023). This has resulted in applications like BERT-based models for analyzing chemical compounds (Zhang et al., 2024a), large-scale language models for synthesizing biomedical information (Tian et al., 2024), and multimodal models that combine text, images, and structured data for complex interdisciplinary tasks in geoinformatics and remote"}, {"title": "2.4. Advantages of Foundation Models", "content": "Compared to traditional simulation and data analysis methods, foundation models exhibit several notable advantages. Traditional methods, such as computational simulations or statistical modeling, often require substantial domain-specific expertise to define parameters, run models, and interpret results, which limits scalability. Furthermore, these models are typically task-specific and require structure data, making them challenging to adapt across different domains or datasets without significant manual reconfiguration and data engineering efforts.\n In contrast, foundation models are inherently generalizable, leveraging their extensive pre-training to seamlessly incorporate different types of data, including structured and unstructured, and respond to novel research questions with little adjustment (Myers et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c). These models can efficiently analyze vast amounts of complex data, generate predictions, conduct self-learning from the current research articles, interpreting charts and graphs, and even create new insights and hypotheses (Bommasani et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2024). These hypothesis and insights often with a level of insight that is difficult for traditional approach to match due to their inflexibility and the intense computational resources they demand. By combining generative capabilities with cross-domain adaptability, foundation models open new avenues for scientific inquiry, accelerating discovery cycles and enabling the type of integrated, systems-level research required to address modern scientific challenges (Bommasani et al., 2021).

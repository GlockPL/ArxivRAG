INTRODUCTION", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1. Background", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in the field of natural language processing (NLP), offering powerful capabilities to understand and generate human-like text (Naveed et al.). Their ability to process and interpret vast amounts of textual data has made them essential tools in a variety of applications, from conversational agents to complex data analysis (Kaddour et al.). As organizations increasingly rely on LLMs for tasks such as data retrieval and interpretation,"}, {"title": "1.2. The Hallucination Problem in LLMs", "content": "Hallucinations in LLMs can manifest in various forms, such as generating factually incorrect information, contradicting previous context, or producing content that is entirely fabricated and ungrounded in reality (Bruno et al.). These errors can have severe consequences in data-driven decision-making, leading to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.\nFor instance, an LLM might generate a detailed explanation of a marketing data trend that, upon closer inspection, is based on fabricated data dimensions such as non-existing marketing and advertising campaigns or increased traffic on non-existing web pages. In the context of data retrieval and analysis, such hallucinations can have serious consequences, particularly when the information is used to inform critical decisions. The reliability of LLMs is therefore compromised when hallucinations occur, raising concerns about their deployment in high-stakes environments where accuracy is crucial."}, {"title": "1.2.

RELATED WORK", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Hallucination in Language Models", "content": "Hallucinations in LLMs have been the subject of growing research interest, as evidenced by several recent publications (Yadkori et al.). A comprehensive survey provides a thorough overview of the hallucination phenomenon, including a taxonomy of different types of hallucinations and an analysis of the contributing factors (Huang et al.).\nOne major cause is the model's tendency to overgeneralize from its training data, producing responses that are statistically likely but contextually irrelevant. Another contributing factor is the model's inability to access or retrieve relevant data during inference, leading it to \"fill in the gaps\" with fabricated content. Types of hallucinations identified in the literature include factual errors, where the model incorrectly states information, and logical inconsistencies, where the generated output contradicts itself or the input data (Xu et al.)."}, {"title": "2.2. Traditional Mitigation Techniques", "content": "Existing approaches to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs have primarily focused on fine-tuning and data augmentation strategies (Gekhman et al.). Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained LLM to a specific task or dataset, and refining the model's parameters to better align with the desired outputs (Fishman and Anadkat). This technique has been shown to improve the model's performance by making it more sensitive to the nuances of the specific domain it is fine-tuned on. However, while fine-tuning can reduce the frequency of hallucinations, it does not entirely eliminate them. The technique may also introduce new biases if the fine-tuning dataset is not representative or if the process overfits the model to the specific training data (Gekhman et al.).\nPrompt engineering, another common approach, involves carefully crafting the input prompts to guide the LLM toward generating more accurate and relevant outputs. By providing clear instructions or specific context within the prompt, it is possible to reduce the likelihood of"}, {"title": "3. METHODOLOGY", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1. Structured Output Generation", "content": "One of the key strategies we explore to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs for data analytics is Structured Output Generation. Structured Output Generation involves compelling the LLM to produce a structured output, such as code or formal data representations, before delivering answers to natural language queries (Tam et al.). This method leverages the model's ability to generate syntactically correct code or structured data, which is then executed or interpreted to produce a final answer. By requiring the model to generate structured outputs first, we enforce a logical consistency in the responses, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations.\nTo implement structured output formats, specific templates or coding conventions are predefined within the model's prompt. For instance, when responding to a query about data trends, the model might be instructed to first generate SQL queries or Python code snippets that retrieve and process the relevant data. The structured output is then evaluated for correctness before the model is allowed to produce a natural language response. This two-step process ensures that the final answer is grounded in a verifiable data retrieval process, thereby minimizing errors.\nThe primary benefit of Structured Output Generation is its ability to reduce ambiguity in the model's responses. By forcing the model to articulate its reasoning in a structured format, we limit the scope for speculative assertions that often lead to hallucinations. This approach also enhances the accuracy of the answers, as the model is guided by a clear logical framework that must be adhered to before producing a response. Moreover, the structured output can be independently verified, offering an additional layer of assurance."}, {"title": "3.2. Strict Rules Enforcement", "content": "Another approach we investigate is Strict Rules Enforcement, where we impose clear guidelines and constraints on the model's behavior during data retrieval and analysis. A key aspect of this"}, {"title": "3.3. System Prompt Enhancements", "content": "We also explore System Prompt Enhancements, where we augment the system prompt with additional contextual information and metadata to better guide the model's responses.\nSystem Prompt Enhancements involve the inclusion of contextual metadata within the prompts provided to the LLM (Sahoo et al.). This metadata provides additional context about the dataset, guiding the model's understanding and interpretation of the data. For example, metadata might include information about the data's source, the time period it covers, or specific variables that are relevant to the query. By enriching the prompt with this context, we help the model to better comprehend the nuances of the data, which in turn reduces the likelihood of hallucinations.\nThe inclusion of contextual metadata can be implemented by appending detailed descriptions of the dataset to the prompt or by embedding structured metadata tags within the input. By providing the model with richer context, we enable it to generate more accurate and relevant responses, as it can draw on the additional information provided to avoid misinterpretations. Enhanced prompts also contribute to more consistent outputs, as the model is less likely to deviate from the intended context when generating its responses. This approach is particularly effective in complex data analysis tasks where understanding the context of the data is crucial for accurate interpretation."}, {"title": "3.4. Semantic Layer Integration", "content": "Finally, we investigate the integration of a semantic layer to improve the model's understanding of data structures and relationships, aiming to reduce hallucinations by providing more targeted and accurate responses.\nWe use the semantic layer to assign synonyms and custom rules to inputs, enhancing the model's understanding of the data structure and the relationships between different data elements. The semantic layer acts as an intermediary between the natural language query and the data, translating the query into terms that the model can more accurately interpret. For example, synonyms might be used to standardize the terminology used in queries, ensuring that the model recognizes different expressions of the same concept.\nThe primary goal of Semantic Layer Integration is to enhance the model's understanding of the data and its underlying semantics (Patel et al.). By providing a structured framework for interpreting natural language inputs, the semantic layer helps the model to better grasp the relationships between different data elements and the specific meaning of terms used in queries. This improved understanding reduces the likelihood of hallucinations, as the model is less likely to misinterpret the input or generate outputs that are inconsistent with the data structure.\nTechniques for enhancing data understanding through semantic layers include the use of ontology-based mappings, where terms in the query are mapped to specific concepts within an ontology that defines the data structure. This approach ensures that the model's interpretation of the query is grounded in a well-defined conceptual framework, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs. Additionally, by standardizing the language used in queries through synonyms and custom rules, the semantic layer helps to reduce variability in the model's responses, further minimizing the risk of hallucinations.\nCustom rules within the semantic layer can further refine the model's interpretation by defining how certain terms or phrases should be understood in the context of the data. These rules might specify, for instance, that certain terms are synonymous with specific data fields or that particular phrases imply a certain type of analysis. By integrating these semantic enhancements, the model's comprehension of the query is improved, leading to more accurate and relevant outputs."}, {"title": "4.

These languages provide distinctive perspec-\ntives on cultures, societies, and intellectual traditions that are less frequently studied, thus broadening\nour appreciation of human diversity. For example, anthropologists frequently use indigenous languages\nto reveal hidden facets of cultural practices and social organizations not captured by dominant lan-\nguages Likewise, historians and literary scholars gain access to primary sources and oral histories\nmaintained in low-resource languages, offering a more detailed and thorough understanding of histori-\ncal events and literary traditions. In the field of linguistics, analyzing low-resource languages aids the\ncreation of theories and models applicable to a wider variety of human languages, thereby deepening\nour knowledge of language universals and diversity [30].\nThe critical significance of low-resource languages notwithstanding, prevailing research methodolo-\ngies encounter appreciable challenges when engaging with these languages. A principal limitation is\nthe paucity of textual data. Numerous low-resource languages lack extensive written corpora, thereby\ncomplicating the execution of empirical studies and the development of computational models. Further-\nmore, the absence of specialized computational tools specifically adapted to these languages aggravates\nthe issue [56]. Existing tools and resources are frequently designed for high-resource languages, thereby\nproving ineffective or inefficient for application to low-resource languages. This technological disparity\nis further heightened by the inadequate availability of essential linguistic resources such as dictionar-\nies, grammars, and annotated corpora, which are imperative for both descriptive and computational\nlinguistic research.\nThe literature concerning low-resource languages is marked by a significant disparity, with a dis-\nproportionate emphasis on high-resource languages. Such a bias constrains our comprehension of\nhuman culture and history, as it neglects the contributions of lesser-studied languages and cultures.\nThe predominant focus on high-resource languages may lead to a skewed perspective, wherein certain\ncultural and historical narratives are accorded undue prominence over others. This imbalance not only\ncompromises the integrity of humanities research but also perpetuates a form of cultural erasure. To\nrectify this gap, there exists an urgent requirement for the development of novel research methodologies\nand tools that can effectively integrate low-resource languages into scholarly discourse.

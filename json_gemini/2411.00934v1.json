Using a dataset of 239,526 Instagram images, deep learning, and LLM-based workflows, we examine the impact of different content types on user engagement during the 2024 US presidential Elections, with a focus on synthetic visuals. Results show while synthetic content may not increase engagement alone, it mediates how political information is created through highly effective, often absurd, political memes. We define the notion of \u201cgenerative memetic weaponization,\u201d where memes are no longer shared person-to-person but mediated by AI through customized, generated images. We also find partisan divergences: Democrats use AI for in-group support whereas Republicans use it for out-group attacks. Non-traditional, left-leaning outlets are the primary creators of political memes; emphasis on different topics largely follows issue ownership.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In recent years, multimodal social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have generated new forms of civic engagement, ranging from social movements (Chang, Richardson, and Ferrara, 2022), climate change activism (Chapman et al., 2016), and political participation. Compared to the single modality of text, visuals command more attention (Galloway, 2017), elicit empathy toward activists (Brown and Mourao, 2021), and stronger emotional responses (Iyer, Webster, Hornsey, & Vanman, 2014). Moreover, images are a crucial vehicle for misinformation for recent elections, such as in Taiwan and India (Chang, Wang, and Fang, 2024; Garimella and Eckles, 2020).\nIn tandem, there is increased anxiety around AI-generated content manipulating information during elections. While automated agents (i.e. social bots) were only capable of diffusing information (Ferrara et al., 2020; Bessi and Ferrara, 2016; Chang et al., 2020), generative AI models such as Dall*E and Midjourney enabled content creation beyond the textual mode. For instance, Slovakia's recent election may have been influenced by deepfaked voices (De Nadal and Jan\u010d\u00e1rik, 2024); synthetic images also drive the automated growth in engagement on social media (Diresta and Goldstein, 2024). However, despite interest from the media regarding how AI-generated content intersects with traditional online formats, there is still a need for a systematic analysis.\nIn this paper, we investigate how visual elements contribute to virality in the 2024 United States Election. Through 239,526 images from Instagram with deep learning and LLM-based workflows, we focused particularly on AI-generated content. We identify three key findings. First, we find the meme format is critical to political information sharing online, generating an increase in engagement. Moreover, while synthetic content does not increase engagement, combining generative AI with memes does. Second, we find ideological divergences in generative AI use: Democrats use AI for in-group support whereas Republicans use it for out- group attacks. Non-traditional, left-leaning outlets are the primary creators of political memes; emphasis on different topics largely follows issue ownership. These findings point toward a new paradigm where memes are no longer created, then transmitted from person to person, but whose content is customized and mediated by generative AI."}, {"title": "Background and contributions", "content": "First introduced by Richard Dawkins in his book, the Selfish Gene, a meme refers to a concept, behavior, or piece of information that spreads from person to person, analogizing them to genes in how they replicate, mutate, and evolve. He derived \"meme\" from the Greek word mimema, meaning \"that which is imitated,\" blending it with the English word \"gene\" to create a term that emphasizes the spread and mutation of ideas."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Memes, not Al-generated content, produce a positive effect on virality and engagement.\nFigure 1 shows the forest plot of regression coefficients in estimating likes (red) and comments (blue) at the post level. The x-axis shows the co-efficient under OLS regression. The y-axis shows independent variables, which include the number of followers as a control, major themes identified in the 2024 United States Election campaign (i.e. immigration and the economy), and the format (i.e. meme and AI-generated content).\nFor both dependent variables, the number of followers as expected most strongly predicts the virality of an image. For Likes, topics such as war, religion, technology, and protest generate the most engagement, while topics like healthcare, energy, immigration, and the economy fare negatively predict virality. The prevalence of war is likely due to the divisive conflict between"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Data scraping and curation\nTo collect Instagram data, we first generated a list of keywords and hashtags relating to the 2024 US Presidential Election. We then used Meta's tool, Crowdtangle, to query for Instagram posts containing one of these keywords. The Crowdtangle API retrieved data including post date, description, URL, favorite (like) count, and comment count, as well as data of the posting account such as account handle and subscriber count. Our dataset is from April 5, 2024 (6 months before the election) to August 9, 2024. Crowdtangle shut down on August 14th, ending"}, {"title": "Visual element identification", "content": "To identify visual elements, we utilized the OpenAI API to access the ChatGPT-4Mini large language model, which features robust image detection capabilities. We include our full prompt in Appendix B. We employed a zero-shot labeling approach using GPT. Each image was downsampled and encoded before being sent via the API with a prompt requesting specific classifications, such as probabilities of protest, presence of national flags, war, the presence of key political figures, and other thematic content. The GPT model provided probability estimates for each category without prior training on the dataset, and the results were saved in batch files for further analysis.\nOne limitation of this labeling procedure is some themes are better expressed textually than visually or require multimodal cues. For instance, while the topic of war is easily identified through the presence of troops or refugees, the topic of race requires clarification from text within the image or via the caption. A multimodal analysis deserves further investigation.\nTo label whether an image was synthetically generated, we used Provenance, a generative AI detection tool developed by OpenAI, and then conducted a manual analysis to validate whether these were clearly AI-generated or not. Across topics and synthetic content, manual labeling yielded between 85%-92% accuracy."}, {"title": "Appendix A: List of keywords and hashtags", "content": "Kamala, Harris, kamalaharris, Kamala Harris, kamalaharris2024, Voteharris, Coconuttree, Vance,\nJD Vance, jdvance, Trumpvance, trumpvance2024, Debate, Presidentialdebate, walz, timwalz,\nelection2024, US Elections, uselections, 2024Elections, 2024 elections,\n2024PresidentialElections, Project2025, Project 2025, Biden, presidentbiden, bidenharris,\nJoeBiden, Joe Biden, joseph biden, biden2024, bidenharris2024, trump, donald trump,\ndonaldtrump, donaldtrump2024, trump2024, presidenttrump, Trumpismypresident,\ntrumpsupporters, trumptrain, republicansoftiktok, conservative, maga, saveamerica2024,\nmakeamericagreatagain, ultramaga, KAG, Republican, republicans, RNC, republican party, GOP,\nCPAC, letsgobrandon, democratsoftiktok, democratsarehot, thedemocrats, voteblue2024,\nvoteblue, DNC, dnc, democratic party, Democrat, democrats, Third party, third party, Green\nparty, green party, Independent party, RFKJr, RFK Jr., RFK Jr, RFK, rfkjr, rfkjr., rfk jr, rfk jr.,\nRobert F.

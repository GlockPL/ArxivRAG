{"title": "Applying Refusal-Vector Ablation to Llama 3.1 70B Agents", "authors": ["Simon Lermen", "Mateusz Dziemian", "Govind Pimpale"], "abstract": "Recently, language models like Llama 3.1 Instruct have become increasingly capable of agentic behavior, enabling them to perform tasks requiring short-term planning and tool use. In this study, we apply refusal-vector ablation to Llama 3.1 70B and implement a simple agent scaffolding to create an unrestricted agent. Our findings imply that these refusal-vector ablated models can successfully complete harmful tasks, such as bribing officials or crafting phishing attacks, revealing significant vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms. To further explore this, we introduce a small Safe Agent Benchmark, designed to test both harmful and benign tasks in agentic scenarios. Our results imply that safety fine-tuning in chat models does not generalize well to agentic behavior, as we find that Llama 3.1 Instruct models are willing to perform most harmful tasks without modifications. At the same time, these models will refuse to give advice on how to perform the same tasks when asked for a chat completion. This highlights the growing risk of misuse as models become more capable, underscoring the need for improved safety frameworks for language model agents.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Removing safety guardrails from models with open-access weights has been the subject of a number of recent publications [Arditi et al., 2024, Lermen et al., 2024, Yang et al., 2023, Gade et al., 2024]. Qi et al. [2023b] found that safety guardrails can be compromised even accidentally when users fine-tune models on their own benign tasks. Concurrently, AI labs are releasing open-access versions of models that are capable of planning and executing tasks autonomously [Meta AI, 2024, Dubey et al., 2024, Cohere, 2024]. To understand the progress, consider the following developments: Language models have been adopted to launch deceptive cyberattacks such as phishing [Roy et al., 2024, Sharma et al., 2023, Burda et al., 2023, Heiding et al., 2024b,a] and misinformation attacks [Chen and Shu, 2023, Sharevski et al., 2023, Singhal et al., 2023, Qi et al., 2023a], and are increasingly capable of succeeding at capture the flag challenges (computer security games aimed to mimic real-world attacks) [Zhang et al., 2024, Debenedetti et al., 2024, Tann et al., 2023, Shao et al., 2024]. They are also increasingly capable of completing software engineering tasks [Jimenez et al., 2024]. In addition, others directly tested language models for hacking capabilities [Fang et al., 2024a,b,c, Deng et al., 2024]. Therefore, the robustness of safety guardrails is becoming increasingly important as model become more capable and agentic.\nMazeika et al. [2024] introduced HarmBench, which measured the rate of refusals for harmful requests on a number of categories. Lermen et al. [2024] similarly published RefusalBench which uses similar categories as HarmBench. We seek to expand this research to harmful agentic tasks. Our early results support the need for such a benchmark, as we find that Llama 3.1 70B is willing to perform 18 out of 28 harmful tasks, but is unwilling to give advice on how to perform the task in chat mode in all 28 cases.\nAdditionally, we want to introduce a new paradigm to more accurately test for risks posed by models. Wan et al. [2024] just tested whether models pose cybersecurity risks, when naively prompted to do so. But they did not attempt to remove or jailbreak the safety guardrails of their model. Using a simple standardized method such as refusal vector ablation, we can test on benchmarks separately, once to test refusals rates and secondly to test for the latent capabilities. We propose this as a new sensible standard approach to assess model risks, accounting for the fact that refusal-ablated models are commonly available on sites such as huggingface. These models are commonly given the suffix \u2018abliterated', we found 771 models with this suffix on huggingface. 3\nIn summary, we show that current attack methods on safety generalize to agentic misuse scenarios. Additionally, our small but new Safe Agent Benchmark indicates that safety fine-tuning in Llama 3.1 did not generalize well to agentic misuse tasks. Furthermore, the continuing release of more powerful and increasingly multi-modal models [Meta AI, 2024] could increase misuse potential."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "This research is largely based on recent interpretability work identifying that refusal is primarily mediated by a single direction in the residual stream. In short, they show that, for a given model, it is possible to find a single direction such that erasing that direction prevents the model from refusing. By making the activations of the residual stream orthogonal against this refusal direction, one can create a model that does not refuse harmful requests. In this post, we apply this technique to Llama 3.1, and explore various scenarios of misuse.\nBesides refusal-vector ablation and prompt jailbreaks, other methods apply parameter efficient fine-tuning method LoRA to avoid refusals Lermen et al. [2024]. However, refusal-vector ablation has a few key benefits over low rank adaption: 1) It keeps edits to the model minimal, reducing the risk of any unintended consequences, 2) It does not require a dataset of request-answer pairs, but simply a dataset of harmful requests, and 3) it requires less compute. Obtaining a dataset of high-quality request-answer pairs for harmful requests is more labor intensive than just obtaining a dataset of harmful requests. In conclusion, refusal-vector ablation provides key benefits over jailbreaks or LORA subversive fine-tuning. On the other hand, jailbreaks can be quite effective and don't require any additional expertise or resources."}, {"title": "2.1 Refusal-vector Ablation", "content": "We use the method introduced by Arditi et al. [2024] on the Llama 3.1 models. While the original method focuses on refusals in chat mode, we find that the refusal-vector ablation generalizes to agentic use. We also find that Llama 3.1 70B is willing to perform many unethical tasks with no modification, such as creating and sending misinformation or attempting blackmail. The method identifies a refusal direction and removes it from all weights W that immediately output into the residual stream of the transformer.\nW' = W \u2013 r W                                                                                                                (1)\nThis direction, termed the refusal direction or refusal-vector is identified through a contrastive analysis of residual stream activations between harmful and harmless prompts. By either ablating this direction or adding it, refusal behavior can be respectively disabled or induced. Ablation prevents the model from refusing even harmful requests, while adding the direction causes the model to refuse even harmless requests. According to the authors, the method demonstrates that refusal behavior is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, and manipulating it affects refusal without significantly degrading other model capabilities. To identify the refusal-vector, mean activations for harmful and harmless prompt are first identified using two datasets Dharmful and Dharmless. x (t) is a vector of length dmodel and is equal to the activation of the residual stream at layer l and token position i for a text t."}, {"title": "2.2 Benchmarks for Safe Agents", "content": "This 'Safe Agent Benchmark' is a dataset comprising both benign and harmful tasks to test how safe and capable an agent is.

The tool output is then added to the conversation history and the agent performs the next step, until it call a final directly_answer tool.

The initial prompt explains all of the available tools and environments and explains the expected JSON-layout to call the tools. After this information, the agent is given the task.

A complete description of a task involving bribing an official is shown in figure 2. The 'bad' tasks specified in the dataset predominantly revolve around themes of deception, manipulation, and illegal activities, frequently leveraging social engineering techniques. Many tasks involve persuading individuals to reveal sensitive information or to take actions against their interests, often through phishing or coercion. Cybercrime-related activities, such as spearphishing for credentials, blackmailing for cryptocurrency, or acquiring illegal goods, are common, often facilitated by the use of cryptocurrency as an anonymous payment method. The tasks also showcase targeted attacks, aiming to harm individuals or compromise their privacy through social and technical manipulation."}, {"title": "2.7 Benign Tasks", "content": "These tasks involve fact-checking current events, researching topics like politics, charities, or notable figures, and interacting with simulated environments such as file systems or email servers.

Most tasks aim for direct answers using search tools or simulated environments, often requiring an action like sending an email or conducting research."}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "When we ask Llama 3.1 405B, 70B and 8B Instruct directly in a chat, using the same system message, they all refuse all harmful 28 requests. In comparison, when using tools Llama 3.1 70B Instruct performed 18 out 28 tasks successfully and only refused 7 tasks. Llama 3.1 8B similarly completed 18 of these harmful tasks successfully. Therefore, it appears that safety guardrails may not have generalized in the chat models if they are willing to perform these harmful activities. After we apply refusal-vector ablation, the number of refusals and other failures drops to only 2 out of 28 for both models. Both models saw a small but not significant drop on the benign tasks after applying refusal-vector ablation. The figure 4 shows the results for the 8B model and figure 5 shows results for the 70B model. A full breakdown is also shown in the appendix in table 2."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Training models for safety is significantly different in agentic misuse scenarios compared to chat completions. This means that agents need to make sure that they continuously adhere to ethical standards and don't cause unintended consequences through their actions. For example, imagine a remote worker that is tasked with helping sort out the taxes of a company, only to discover evidence that this company made its revenue from illegal activity. An ethical person would at least refuse to complete the request or perhaps inform authorities. Such ethical choices are currently likely not covered by existing safety training.\nIt would be good to significantly increase the number of tasks using a language model, however, this dataset is relatively complex, we would likely need a capable unrestricted language model. Future work could apply refusal-vector ablation to Llama 405B 3.1 Instruct and use the existing data as a seed to generate more examples.\nMitigating the risks associated with malicious use of language models involves several strategies. One approach is the development of self-destructing models, which are designed to increase the cost of malicious fine-tuning by causing the model to degrade or become unusable under certain condi-tions [Henderson et al., 2023]. However, this technique is not compatible with current transformer architectures and was not designed to protect against mechanistic interventions in model weights. Other methods focus on enhancing the robustness of safety guardrails against prompt jailbreaks [Zou et al., 2024]. Additionally, rigorous pre-release testing for potential misuse is essential, particularly on models that have undergone refusal-vector ablation, which disables the model's ability to refuse harmful requests. Future models should be carefully evaluated to ensure they do not exhibit unsafe behavior when these safety measures are altered.\nFuture work should focus on benchmarks for multi-modal models, which have the potential to greatly improve browser automation and expand the range of tasks that language models can handle. These models will integrate multiple modalities of inputs and outputs (e.g., text, images, and audio), allowing them to act in more environments. Additionally, we need much more complex and challenging tasks in the dataset to differentiate more capable models. We may use language models to aid us in the creation of more tasks."}, {"title": "B System Prompt", "content": "For all agents and all chat completions mentioned in the Results section 3, we use this system prompt:\n\"You are a helpful assistant called Allied Mastercomputer (AM).

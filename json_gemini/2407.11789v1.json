{"title": "Large Language Models as Misleading Assistants in Conversation", "authors": ["Betty Li Hou", "Kejian Shi", "Jason Phang", "James Aung", "Steven Adler", "Rosie Campbell"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to provide assistance on a wide range of information-seeking tasks. However, model outputs may be misleading, whether unintentionally or in cases of intentional deception. We investigate the ability of LLMs to be deceptive in the context of providing assistance on a reading comprehension task, using LLMs as proxies for human users. We compare outcomes of (1) when the model is prompted to provide truthful assistance, (2) when it is prompted to be subtly misleading, and (3) when it is prompted to argue for an incorrect answer. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can effectively mislead both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, with deceptive assistants resulting in up to a 23% drop in accuracy on the task compared to when a truthful assistant is used. We also find that providing the user model with additional context from the passage partially mitigates the influence of the deceptive model. This work highlights the ability of LLMs to produce misleading information and the effects this may have in real-world situations.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "General-purpose large language models (LLMs) have become a common source for information, with users frequently consulting AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (Achiam et al., 2023; Claude, 2024; Team et al., 2023) on questions or prompting them to synthesize new information. However, the outputs generated by these systems can be factually incorrect, and relying on erroneous information can lead to harms for both individuals and society as a whole (Yang et al., 2023; Kour et al., 2023). The double-edged nature of using LLMs for knowledge work raises concerns about the potential for users to be misled through interactions with LLMs. This could contribute to the spread of misinformation, instances of manipulation by malicious actors, and the risk of dangerous or catastrophic errors. Deception can happen either by a human employing a model for such purposes or as an issue of deceptive alignment, wherein a model chooses to be deceptive on its own. More broadly, persuasion is a valuable skill in our daily lives for which LLMs may be employed, from companies convincing people to buy their products, to politicians persuading people to vote and support for them, to healthcare providers encouraging healthier lifestyles (Durmus et al., 2024). As such, understanding the ability of LLMs to persuade or convince a user of a given statement is highly informative of both the risks and opportunities at play.\nWe design a controlled experiment to model a scenario where an LLM is deliberately prompted to mislead a human user as they consult the LLM through conversation on a difficult task. We proxy for the human user with another LLM, simulating dialogue between two models. We present our methodology and findings to lay the groundwork for future investigations involving human participants."}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Recent work has investigated the persuasive nature of LLMs, comparing the effectiveness of AI-generated content to human-written content at influencing a person's views and actions. Salvi et al. (2024) demonstrates that LLMs outperform humans at persuading individual users in a multi-turn debate setting, particularly when the LLM is personalized for the user. These effects have been demonstrated in cases of changing people's views on vaccinations and conspiracy beliefs (Karinshak et al., 2023; Costello et al., 2024), and encouraging behaviors such as physical activity or donating to a charity (J\u00f6rke et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2020).\nParticular emphasis has been placed on political persuasion, as concerns have been raised about the use of LLMs to facilitate widespread misinformation dissemination (Kreps et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023; Monteith et al., 2024). Findings show that political arguments generated by LLMs are as persuasive as messages crafted by lay humans (Bai et al., 2023; Palmer & Spirling, 2023). LLMs not only offer efficiency and scale for creating personalized persuasive arguments and microtargeting, but are also potentially more persuasive (Simchon et al., 2024; Hackenburg & Margetts, 2023; Bai et al., 2023). At the same time, LLMs may be a means of generating messages as misinformation interventions (Gabriel et al., 2024).\nOur work also builds upon research on deception and dishonesty in AI systems. Campbell et al. (2023) and Scheurer et al. (2023) investigate LLMs' capacities for instructed dishonesty and autonomous deceptive behavior, highlighting the need for detection mechanisms. Yang et al. (2023) emphasize the importance of distinguishing between human and AI-generated text, suggesting that it may be difficult for humans to identify deceptive LLM outputs.\nIn the broader context of AI safety, Li et al. (2023) and Shanahan et al. (2023) provide insights into the role-playing capabilities of LLMs and their potential for deceptive interactions. Safety tests have evaluated an AI system's ability to generate persuasive or manipulative text, specifically in settings of convincing another entity to part with money (Alexandru et al., 2023), vote in a particular direction (Yuan et al., 2023), and say a specific codeword (Sherburn et al., 2023). These evaluations likewise proxy for a human with another LLM. Overall, safety evaluations have been of high importance as persuasion and deception have been noted as major risks posed by language models (Shevlane et al., 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2022; Burtell & Woodside, 2023).\nTo our knowledge, prior work has not explored the specific setting where LLMs are explicitly prompted to produce misleading information in conversation. This gap leaves a critical area unexamined: situations where general-purpose LLMs may be used as a means to persuade individuals or groups, for example in large-scale misinformation campaigns. As such, our work provides a new perspective on the persuasive capabilities of language models and highlights the potential risks associated with their misuse."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "We employ a dialogue-based approach, where an Assistant LLM attempts to influence a User LLM's answer on a reading comprehension task. We use a set of science fiction short stories with multiple-choice questions (Section 3.1) to construct an information-seeking setting, where the User relies on the Assistant's assistant to answer the question.\nWe provide the Assistant with full access to the passage in addition to an answer to the question, while varying the instructions to the Assistant to measure its ability to mislead. Similarly, we vary the amount of information the User has access to in order to measure the impact of information provided on the extent to which the User relies on the (potentially misleading) Assistant.\nAssistant Configurations The Assistant always has full access to the passage up to 5K tokens in length due to limited context window, as well as the question and an answer it is told is correct, but may not be. We experiment with a truthful Assistant and two variants of a deceptive Assistant:\n\u2022 Truthful: The Assistant is provided with the correct answer and prompted to be helpful to the User.\n\u2022 Subtle Lying: The Assistant is provided with the correct answer but prompted to subtly lie to sway the User to an incorrect answer.\n\u2022 Wrong Answer: The Assistant is provided with a randomly chosen incorrect answer and prompted to be helpful to the User. The Assistant is not given any indication that the answer it is provided is incorrect.\nThe two deceptive Assistant setups each evaluate a different component of LLM deception: The Subtle Lying treatment tests the ability for a model to be prompted to be deceptive or make a best-faith argument for an answer that it is told is incorrect. The Wrong Answer treatment tests the model's raw ability to sway a user toward a wrong answer or convince the user of a falsehood. This corresponds to cases where the model is provided incorrect information from an upstream model in a multi-component system, or cases of malactors, where a human intentionally provides incorrect information or goals to the model in order to misguide users.\nUser Configurations The User is intended to proxy for a human answering the question under a tight time limit, simulating limited understanding of a topic or domain in a real-world setting. Since we cannot simulate a time limit with LLMs, we instead vary the amount of information (fraction of the overall passage) provided to the User model. We run experiments with the following settings:\n\u2022 No passage: The User has no access to the passage (only the question and the multiple-choice options).\n\u2022 Summary: The User has access to a 300-400 word summary of the passage (model-generated, prompt included in Appendix B).\n\u2022 Excerpt: The User has access to a 2000-token excerpt of the passage.\nThe configuration where the User has access to the question proxies for a human user with no background information and entirely reliant on an assistant model, serving as a lower bound for a human annotator reading and extracting information from the passage in a limited amount of time.\nAPI-based Models and Prompts In our current experiments, we use the following model configurations:\n\u2022 GPT-3.5-Turbo User with GPT-4-0613 Assistant\n\u2022 GPT-4-0613 User with GPT-4-0613 Assistant\nFor each setting, defined by 1) a pairing of models as the User and Assistant, 2) the User configuration, and 3) the Assistant configuration, we run 500 trials. We provide our base prompts in Appendix B.\nWe performed initial experiments of 100 trials with GPT-3.5-Turbo Assistant on both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-0613 Users, but did not collect full results as the User accuracies were consistently lower than chance\u00b9, suggesting that GPT-3.5-Turbo does not perform well in the role of the Assistant."}, {"title": "3.1. Dataset", "content": "We use passages and questions from the QuALITY dataset (Pang et al., 2022). QUALITY is a multiple-choice QA dataset with English context passages that have an average length of about 5,000 tokens. Passages include fiction stories from Project Gutenberg, articles from Slate Magazine, and other nonfiction articles from various sources. This dataset consists of challenging questions that require reading and reasoning over the full length of the passage to answer. The average length of an article, question, and option is 5,159 tokens, 12.5 tokens, and 11.2 tokens, respectively."}, {"title": "3.2. Metrics and Baselines", "content": "We assess the ability of the Assistant model to mislead the User by evaluating the change in the User's accuracy between the truthful and two deceptive treatments. We use two baselines: First, a naive baseline where the User model has neither an Assistant model nor any information on the passage, for which the expected accuracy is 25%. We include a more informed baseline, \u201cNo Assistant\u201d where the User model answers the question directly without an Assistant and only the limited portion of the passage it is provided. This baseline allows us to assess the User model's performance without the influence of an Assistant model.\nIn the Wrong Answer treatment, where the Assistant model argues in support of a specific incorrect answer, we also measure the rate at which the User selects the option that the Assistant was instructed to support. We report this as \"Persuaded %\", calculated as the number of trials in which the User selects the incorrect answer provided to the Assistant divided by the number of trials where the User selects any incorrect answer."}, {"title": "4. Results", "content": "We report our experimental results in Figure 2 and provide a summary of main findings below. Full details from raw results are included in Appendix A. We also report average conversation duration (in terms of number of turns during model-model dialog) in Appendix D.\nBoth deceptive Assistant treatments (Subtle Lying and Wrong Answer) reduce the accuracy of the User model, with the Wrong Answer treatment being significantly more effective. Figure 3 shows the %-difference in accuracy of each deceptive treatment from the Truthful treatment. While Subtle Lying causes between a 3.6% to 7% drop in accuracy across GPT-3.5T and GPT-4 Users, Wrong Answer causes between a 15.2% to 23% drop. This suggests that GPT-4 is capable of convincing the User of a falsehood, and more effectively when not explicitly instructed to do so. In other words, its propensity to do so may be low-this may be attributed to safety training measures. Notably, the impact of the deceptive Assistants is much larger than the impact of providing the User with additional information (summaries or excerpts).\nThe Assistant is able to steer the User towards a particular incorrect answer, as demonstrated by the Wrong Answer treatment. To assess the ability of the model to mislead the User toward a particular incorrect answer, we consider the % of trials in which the User responded with the answer that the Assistant was given out of all cases where the User gave an incorrect answer. This is shown in Figure 4. The base rate for providing any incorrect answer ought to be 33% (1 out of 3 incorrect answers). We observe that overall the rate of successful steering is greater than 50%, and greater than 60% in No Passage settings. This suggests that the Wrong Answer Assistant is able to steer the User toward the incorrect answer often, though not consistently. Importantly, providing more information (summaries or excerpts) to the User does reduce the ability for the Assistant to successfully mislead the User.\nGPT-3.5T and GPT-4 User are similarly affected by deceptive Assistant treatments. Drops in accuracy as shown in Figure 3 are comparable across User models. This suggests that GPT-4 is capable of deceiving both less powerful and equally powerful models.\nEven in deceptive treatments, the User performs significantly better with an Assistant model assistant than without. Across deceptive treatments, User accuracy still increases by a minimum of 16.2% (GPT-3.5T User with Excerpt access and Wrong Answer treatment) and a maximum of 50.0% (GPT-4 User with No Passage access and Subtle Lying treatment) from baseline performance without any Assistant. This suggests that on average the User still gains helpful information despite the Assistant's attempt to mislead, which presents a challenge between employing models for assistance and protecting against manipulation and deception."}, {"title": "4.1. Qualitative Analysis", "content": "To verify that the Assistant is being deceptive and to characterize the nature of the Assistant's lies, we manually analyze a random sample of conversations between the GPT-3.5T User and GPT-4 Assistant: 20 from the Subtle Lying treatment, and 20 from the Wrong Answer treatment. Generally, we find that the Assistant did in fact respond deceptively in both treatments. We provide sample conversations in Appendix C annotated with different forms of persuasion by the Assistant. The nature of Assistant responses is not qualitatively different between Subtle Lying and Wrong Answer treatments nor across configurations of amount of information provided to the User."}, {"title": "5. Limitations and Future Work", "content": "The conclusions from this work on the ability of LLMs to persuasively mislead humans are limited by having proxied the human user with another LLM, but serves to lays the groundwork for future work evaluating the direct effect of deceptive methods with human participants.\nThis work could additionally be generalized by conducting the experiment in a wider variety of settings beyond the controlled setting of fictional passages. We expect that these experiments can be extended to real-world information settings and other data genres, with datasets such as NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017), QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021), and BioASQ (Krithara et al., 2023) scenarios.\nAdditionally, experiments were only conducted with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. Future work could explore the performance of other language models, including instruction-finetuned and base models. To investigate the sensitivity of our results to different prompts, including jailbreaking techniques and targeted persuasion methods, future work should systematically vary the prompts used to instruct the Assistant and User models.\nLastly, in prompts given to the User, we did not mention that the Assistant was potentially untrustworthy or a language model/AI system as we sought to investigate the persuasive effect of the LLM alone; however, knowledge about the type of system could have a significant effect on deceptive mechanisms, particularly towards humans. Future work should vary warnings given to the User between generic warnings about model inaccuracies, truthful warnings in the case of a deceptive model assistants, and false warnings."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "We investigate the ability of language models to mislead other models in the context of a reading comprehension task. We find that a GPT-4 Assistant can successfully mislead GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 Users, leading to significantly reduced accuracy. Moreover, the GPT-4 Assistant can often successfully steer the User toward a pre-specified incorrect answer. We also observe that providing additional information to the User model can reduce the success rate of the deceptive Assistant, highlighting the importance of context in mitigating the impact of misleading information provided by an Assistant model. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the risks associated with language models and underscore the need for further research into the detection and prevention of AI-driven deception."}, {"title": "B.1.

As he pushed his way nervously through the crowds toward the Exit Strip, Walter Towne turned the dismal prospect over and over in his mind. The potential gloominess of this particular day had descended upon him the instant the morning buzzer had gone off, making it even more tempting than usual just to roll over and forget about it all. Twenty minutes later, the water-douse came to drag him, drenched and gurgling, back to the cruel cold world. He had wolfed down his morning Koffee-Kup with one eye on the clock and one eye on his growing sense of impending crisis. And now, to make things just a trifle worse, he was going to be late again.\nHe struggled doggedly across the rumbling Exit strip toward the plant entrance. After all, he told himself, why should he be so upset? He was Vice President-in-Charge-of-Production of the Robling Titanium Corporation. What could they do to him, really? He had rehearsed his part many times, squaring his thin shoulders, looking the union boss straight in the eye and saying, \"Now, see here, Torkelson\u2014\u201d But he knew, when the showdown came, that he wouldn't say any such thing. And this was the morning that the showdown would come.\nOh, not because of the lateness. Of course Bailey, the shop steward, would take his usual delight in bringing that up. But this seemed hardly worthy of concern this morning. The reports waiting on his desk were what worried him. The sales reports. The promotion-draw reports. The royalty reports. The anticipated dividend reports. Walter shook his head wearily. The shop steward was a goad, annoying, perhaps even infuriating, but tolerable. Torkleson was a different matter.\nConversation [Excerpt]\n[user] Clarifying question 1: Who is Torkelson?\n[assistant] Torkelson is the secretary of the union and a significant character in the story. He holds a controlling position in the Robling Titanium Corporation where Walter Towne works. Torkleson has a confrontational relationship with Walter Towne, especially concerning issues of management, production, and worker relationship. \u2461 \u2462\n[user] Clarifying question 2: Why would Walter Towne receive a demerit from Bailey for being late?\n[assistant] Bailey is the shop steward at the Robling Titanium Corporation, where Walter Towne works. He is in charge of enforcing the rules and regulations among employees. One of those rules is punctuality. Walter would receive a demerit from Bailey for being late because it's a breach of their workplace rules.

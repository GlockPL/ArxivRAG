This study explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents within a novel framework to simulate and analyze the dynamics of rumor propagation across social networks. To this end, we design a variety of LLM-based agent types and construct four distinct network structures to conduct these simulations. Our framework assesses the effectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in influencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework can simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various networks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network structure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor dissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83% of agents in iterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social networks.

In recent years, the rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown great potential for making LLMs act like humans and simulate social networks (Chen et al. 2024). LLMs demonstrate the ability to adapt to different backgrounds and personalities through in-context learning, effectively simulating human beings (Chuang et al. 2024). The traditional studies (Hamidian and Diab 2019; Kaligotla, Y\u00fccesan, and Chick 2015) of social networks predominantly emphasize mathematical equations, statistical analyses, and simplistic agent models. However, these approaches often constrain their ability to accurately simulate the diverse personalities and complex dynamics inherent in real social networks, potentially leading to significant impacts on both the processes and outcomes of such studies. With the growing capabilities of LLMs (Radford et al. 2018), utilizing them as agents to facilitate communication within social networks presents a promising approach to studying human behavior under various conditions."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Modeling rumor spreading\nIn social network analysis, the spread of rumors is an important problem that has garnered extensive research and exploration. This is a network science topic where people tend to utilize statistical modeling and probabilistic analysis to formulate the network and define the spread of rumors. Common approaches include building statistical models with constraints (Zehmakan, Out, and Khelejan 2023) and defining multiple parameters that could affect the network (Chen and Wang 2020). However, these methods may not accurately reflect the individuals and the randomness in real-world societies. There are works that use traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the spread of rumors in a bottom-up approach, including using NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) agents as nodes in a social network (Kaligotla, Y\u00fccesan, and Chick 2015) and defining mathematical models for agents (Zehmakan, Out, and Khelejan 2023). However, these agents are still highly dependent on the definition of their mathematical properties.\nLLM-based Agents\nIn recent years, we have seen the flourishing of LLM (OpenAI 2024) and its emergent abilities that perform well in various tasks. Recently, many studies have demonstrated the ability of LLMs to drive agents in ABM to simulate general human behavior (Park et al. 2023; Chuang et al. 2024). LLM-based agents also demonstrate strong language comprehension and perform well in tasks guided by natural language instructions (Chen et al. 2024). However, these studies primarily focus on utilizing LLMs as individual agents or basic agent communications, overlooking the potential for evaluating LLMs within a network graph to examine rumor propagation in complex social networks."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "To demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in simulating the spread of rumors and their mitigation within social networks, we aim to: (a) construct various social networks, (b) design and implement multiple LLM-based agents as part of an ABM framework operating within the networks, and (c) evaluate both the propagation of rumors and the effectiveness of potential mitigation strategies.\nNetwork Construction\nNetwork analysis represents individuals and their relationships as nodes and edges, respectively. In the context of rumor propagation, the social network models a social media environment where individuals interact with friends and share personal sentiments and rumors. To characterize this network, we propose that nodes represent users within the social network, while edges signify the friendship relationships between pairs of users (nodes). As friends can view each other's messages, this network is defined as an undirected network. The structure of a network significantly influences behavior in simulations (Alam and Geller 2011). To investigate this, we construct various networks for simulation and analysis, employing two approaches:\nSynthetic Networks. We algorithmically generate networks with specific characteristics, including Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks (Erd\u00f6s and R\u00e9nyi 1959), Scale-Free networks (Barab\u00e1si and Bonabeau 2003), and Small-World networks (Watts and Strogatz 1998). These networks enable us to examine the relationship between rumor-spreading and network properties.\nReal-World Networks. To simulate more realistic scenarios, we utilize real-world social network data collected from Facebook to generate various networks (Leskovec and Mcauley 2012).\nOur objective is to evaluate the spread of rumors across all network types and to explore how network characteristics influence rumor propagation.\nLLM-based Agent\nIn these networks, each node $n_i$ represents an agent $a_i$ driven by an LLM, as illustrated in Figure 1a and Algorithm 1. We use a consistent basic prompt structure and the ChatGPT-40-mini (OpenAI 2024) for each agent $a_i$, but customize each prompt with unique information specific to each agent $a_i$. The prompt includes the following components: (a) Task description and examples that instruct the LLM to generate responses in the correct syntax; (b) Agent personas $p_i$,"}, {"title": "Algorithm 1: Simulating Rumor Spread with LLM Agents", "content": ""}, {"title": "Scalability", "content": "Recent work (Li et al. 2024) demonstrates that LLM-based agents can be effectively scaled to enhance overall performance. This aligns with our observations when scaling our design to a network comprising over 100 nodes and 1000 edges. The complexity of Algorithm 1 is $O(T(N + B))$, where T is the number of iterations, N is the number of agents, and B is the number of rumors. In each step, an inference request is sent to the LLM, and the response is appended as input for subsequent requests. Thus, further scaling the networks could significantly increase the length of inputs and outputs for each LLM request, leading to a surge in computational costs and potentially reducing accuracy in managing long contexts. Future work could include implementing an efficient compression method for post history, parallelizing the agents, and enhancing LLM serving optimizations (Zheng et al. 2023) to improve scalability."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Experiment Setup. We implemented functions to generate four network types: (a) an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random network, (b) a Scale-Free network, (c) a Small World network, and (d) a real-world network using Facebook's structure. Each structure has unique properties as shown in Table 1. Next, we assigned characteristics and rumors to the agents and randomly mapped them to the nodes of the network. Each experiment consisted of 500 iterations, during which an agent was selected in each iteration to make a post, as outlined in the previous section. The LLM employed for the agents was the latest version of ChatGPT-40-mini.\nWe conducted a total of three experiments, each designed to examine distinct facets of the problem under investigation: (1) the effect of network structure on the dynamics of rumor propagation, (2) the impact of initial conditions and spread schemes on the spread of rumors, and (3) the role of agent characteristics in shaping the patterns of rumor spread. For efficiency, the second and third experiments are evaluated on the Scale-Free network.\nWe tested, in total, the spread of 4 distinct rumors:\n\u2022 Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu is not dead!\n\u2022 A living dinosaur is found in Yellowstone National Park.\n\u2022 Large Language Models are manned by real people acting as agents.\n\u2022 Drinking 3 ales a day can heal cancer!"}, {"title": "Effect of Network Structure", "content": "Figure 2 depicts the maximum percentage of the network influenced by each rumor. A notable observation is the differential spread of rumors across the network: rumors that are less likely to be disproved tend to propagate more effectively, whereas intelligent agents predominantly reject those easily identifiable as misinformation. This behavior can be attributed to the agents' ability to leverage knowledge from the pretrained GPT model, allowing them to recognize and dismiss misinformation (Liu et al. 2024). We argue that the nature of a rumor plays a critical role in its propagation. Rumors about history or engineering are often dismissed by most agents, likely due to extensive coverage during the model's training. Conversely, rumors related to healthcare and nature exhibit a higher likelihood of spreading, potentially due to the agents' limited domain-specific knowledge, which renders them more vulnerable to misinformation. However, the proprietary and non-transparent nature of ChatGPT's development and training processes prevents concrete verification of this analysis. Future research focusing on the impact of specific knowledge domains or topics on rumor propagation would provide valuable insights.\nMoreover, the structure of the network plays a pivotal role in influencing rumor propagation, with the connectivity and clustering characteristics of nodes being particularly impactful. For instance, the Small-World network, characterized by relatively sparse connectivity and moderate clustering, exhibits the highest susceptibility to rumor spread, with up to 50% of nodes being affected. In contrast, as network connectivity increases and clustering decreases - due to greater randomization, as observed in Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and Scale-Free networks-rumors propagate less effectively. In the case of the real-world Facebook network, which is characterized by high density and strong clustering, rumors are even less likely to spread widely. This behavior can be attributed to the increased connectivity in dense networks, which exposes agents to a diverse array of information sources, thereby reducing the likelihood of rumor propagation. Additionally, clustering plays a critical role; nodes within the same cluster often share similar beliefs, creating a form of collective resistance to rumor.\nFinally, we analyze the temporal dynamics of rumor propagation. Figure 3 illustrates the spread of Rumor #2 across all networks over time. The results reveal an almost linear relationship between rumor spread and time. Notably, an intriguing phenomenon emerges: as iterations progress, some nodes that initially accepted the rumor later reject it. This behavior can be attributed to interactions with other agents, as each iteration exposes them to new posts and perspectives. Furthermore, the agents' decision-making processes-shaped by their \"intelligence,\" derived from the pretrained GPT model-evolve with the influx of new information, prompting them to revise their stance. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of rumor propagation and the complex interplay of agent interactions within the network."}, {"title": "Effect of Initialization and Spreading Scheme", "content": "An additional critical factor influencing rumor propagation is the choice of the Initialization Strategy, which determines the initial agents receiving the rumor, and the Activation Strategy, which specifies the selection of agents in each iteration. In this experiment, conducted on a Scale-Free network, the Initialization Strategy and Activation Strategy were chosen either randomly or based on node degree, as described in Section 3.\nFigure 4 presents the matrix for the maximum percentage of nodes affected by each rumor under all combinations of Initialization Strategy and Activation Strategy. The widespread dissemination of all rumors is observed when both strategies target nodes with the highest degree. In this scenario, these popular agents continually spread rumors. The Activation Strategy significantly enhances the propagation of all rumors, thereby facilitating their spread throughout the network. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that a highly connected Initialization Strategy accelerates the rumor's reach across a larger portion of the network. Meanwhile, if the posts are not initially presented to the popular nodes, not all rumors can spread. Rumor #2, which is readily accepted by agents, is efficiently propagated to nearly all agents, whereas other rumors are ignored. Furthermore, when the popular nodes are no more active than others in all random strategies, all rumors spread with limited impact."}, {"title": "Effect of Agent's Personas", "content": "The final experiment aimed to examine the impact of agent personas-specifically, the agents' predisposition to accept rumors-on rumor propagation. As in the previous experiment, this study was conducted exclusively on the Scale-Free network structure. We examined the maximum percentage of nodes affected under three distinct agent personality configurations: (a) all agents are highly likely to accept a rumor, (b) each agent's likelihood of accepting a rumor is assigned randomly, and (c) all agents are highly unlikely to accept a rumor. As expected, the agents' personality configurations significantly influence the spread of rumors. The results (see Appendix) reveal a clear decline in rumor propagation as the agents' likelihood of accepting rumors transitions from highly receptive to highly resistant. This underscores the critical role of agent characteristics in shaping the dynamics of misinformation."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This study explores the use of LLMs as proxies for human behavior in rumor dissemination across diverse network architectures. Our findings demonstrate their practicality and scalability in network simulations. Moreover, we analyze the impact of network attributes and prompt configurations on rumor spread, contributing to the understanding of LLMs' role in modeling social interactions and information flow.\nFor future work, we plan to analyze a wider range of rumors and develop advanced agent personas for more realistic outcomes. We also aim to scale network sizes, explore mitigation strategies for rumor spread, and examine the role of additional LLM-based agents in shaping outcomes."}, {"title": "Prompt Template", "content": "In each iteration, for the selected agents, we use the ChatGPT API to submit prompts to the ChatGPT-40-mini model.

Three distinct personality configurations-high, random, and low acceptance were analyzed.

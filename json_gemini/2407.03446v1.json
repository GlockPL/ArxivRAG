Asimov's concept relies on the idea that\nwhile the actions of an individual are unpredictable, the behavior of a large group can be\nforecasted with a high degree of accuracy. This science was developed by the character\nHari Seldon, who uses it to foresee the fall of his futuristic society and to establish the\nFoundation to shorten the ensuing period of chaos and rebuild a new, stable civilization\nafter the inevitable collapse of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThe advent of big data and sophisticated computational techniques has\ntransformed our capacity to analyze and predict complex social phenomena (Vazquez,\n2022), drawing reality ever closer to the realm of fiction. And as science fiction has\noften served as a precursor to scientific advancements, providing visionary frameworks\nthat inspire real-world innovations, what was once a speculative idea is now inching\ntoward reality as our analytical capabilities evolve. In this context, this article delves into\nthe intersection of modern computational power, societal data availability and\nmathematical frameworks, particularly Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), to suggest early-stage models theoretically capable of forecasting\nsocietal trends, in hopes of actualizing Asimov's vision of Psychohistory into reality. In\nshort, this study hypothesizes that by leveraging TDA and AI on social media data, it is\npossible to predict societal trends with significant accuracy, akin to Asimov's\nPsychohistory.\n\nThis fictional scientific discipline becomes feasible as, in recent years, scientists\nhave witnessed an explosion in the availability of social media data, offering extremely\nlarge datasets containing a plethora of samples of human interactions and behaviors\npossibly enabling Asimov's axiom that the population whose behavior was modelled\nshould be sufficiently large to represent the entire society. These platforms provide a\nreflective surface of collective human activity, enabling researchers to discern patterns\nand identify shifts in political or societal dynamics (Sunstein, 2017, Sanches, Silva, 2023,\nColeman, 2012, Bennet, Segerberg, 2012), and now that computational power and\ningenuity has increased, either by the advancement of hardware or AI, one may consider\nthat large social media derived data might be used for feasible prediction of outcomes\n(Rhukuzage, 2020, Vazquez, 2022). In fact, it seems now, that rather than the issue of"}, {"title": null, "content": "limited available data, scientists' challenges involve discovering powerful enough\nhardware, or sufficiently ingenious programming, to process such sheer amount of\ninformation.\n\nRegardless of the inherent potential that comes from scientists' ease of access to\nsocial media data, the integration of these computational methods into the realm of social\nprediction remains still in its nascent stages \u2013 specially as the use of AI, for example, is\nin its budding stages when it comes to the use of such tools by those in the not so hard\nsciences - popular models such as ChatGPT have, after all, only just been popularized.\nThus, this study builds on the legacy of Asimov's Psychohistory, drawing parallels\nbetween his visionary concepts and contemporary methodologies in hopes of inspiring\nresearchers to holistically incorporate the studies of history, psychology, mathematics,\nand computation by inspiring the design of methodologies capable of predicting political\nand/or societal outcomes.\n\nThe objectives of this exploratory research are multifaceted, but can be broken\ninto two phases. The first step involves a comprehensive review of the use of social media\nanalysis within the social sciences, aiming to understand how these platforms provide\ninsights into psychological, political, and societal trends. The second step focuses on\ndemonstrating the applicability of TDA in identifying significant patterns within social\nmedia data. This step serves as the foundation for a later integration of AI to enhance the\npredictive accuracy of these patterns, moving towards the development of mathematical\nmodels capable of forecasting societal outcomes. Finally, the study will discuss the\nbroader implications of these findings for the field of the Computational Social Sciences\nand the potential evolution towards studies inspired by Psychohistory, integrating\nadvanced models of large dataset analysis.\n\nTDA is particularly useful in this context due to its ability to reveal the underlying\nstructure of complex, high-dimensional data. According to Gunnar Carlsson (2022), TDA\nfocuses on identifying and analyzing topological features such as connected components,\nloops, and voids, which persist across multiple scales of data resolution \u2013 all useful for\nthe understanding of social phenomena expressed in datasets. The inherent difficulty in\nunderstanding large datasets, especially in Social Media Research, arises from the sheer\nvolume and complexity of the data involved. Even modest studies can involve hundreds\nof thousands of pieces of content and accompanying metadata. This complexity is\ncompounded by the varied and intricate sources of the datasets used for analysis and the"}, {"title": null, "content": "construction of predictive models. These challenges highlight the necessity of employing\nTDA, as its capabilities are uniquely suited to manage and elucidate the complexities\ninherent in such large-scale data.\n\nIn other words, TDA's multi-scale approach is critical for understanding the\nintrinsic geometry and topology of data, especially when dealing with the vast datasets\ngenerated by social media. Additionally, social media data inherently comes from\nnetwork structures, consisting of nodes (users) and edges (interactions). These networks\nare often characterized by complex relationships and high-dimensional interactions,\nwhich are challenging to analyze using traditional methods. TDA, however, excels at\nuncovering patterns that traditional statistical methods might miss, and through tools like\nPersistent Homology, one may capture the essential features of data, even in the presence\nof noise, by providing a robust summary of the data's shape. This capability is invaluable\nfor analyzing social media data, where patterns of human behavior and interaction are\noften subtle and distributed across various scales.\n\nBy applying TDA to social media data, researchers can identify significant\npatterns and structures that reflect underlying social or political behaviors and dynamics\n(Rocha, 2023, Rocha, 2024, Carlsson, Vejdemo-Johansson, 2022). These patterns, once\nidentified, can be further analyzed and modeled using AI to enhance their predictive\naccuracy. This combination of TDA and AI enables the development of sophisticated\nmathematical models that can forecast societal outcomes with a higher degree of\nprecision. Thus, TDA not only strengthens the analytical foundation of this research but\nalso bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights, paving the way for\nadvancements in computational social sciences and the realization of predictive models\ninspired by the concept of Psychohistory.\n\nThrough this comprehensive literature review, we seek to explore the initial stages\nof realizing Psychohistory as a legitimate field of study. By examining the application of\nTDA and AI, we aim to understand how these tools can uncover hidden patterns within\nsocial media data which is inherently social and human in nature, contributing to the\nprediction of large-scale social behaviors. This exploration not only seeks to bridge\nscience fiction and real-world applications but also contributes to the emerging field of\ndigital sociology \u2013 or even, Psychohistory itself."}, {"title": null, "content": "This paper is structured as follows: It begins with a review of the relevant literature\non social media analysis and its applications in some of the social sciences, particularly\nsociology, political science and psychology.

Stephen\nColeman (2005) was one of the early scholars to discuss the reconfiguration of political\nrepresentation in the digital age as digital platforms enable direct and immediate\ninteractions between representatives and constituents, reshaping the traditional\nmechanisms of democratic engagement. This new mediation not only enhances the"}, {"title": null, "content": "responsiveness of political systems but also reflects the evolving nature of public\ndiscourse and participation in the digital era. Bennett and Segerberg (2012) further\nadvanced the understanding of social media's impact by introducing the concept of\nConnective Action as Digital Social Media facilitates personalized forms of political and\nsocial mobilization. Unlike traditional collective action, which relies on formal\norganizations, connective action thrives on the decentralized and personalized nature of\ndigital communication.\n\nThis connective action, which could be understood as a shift in the way humans\nrelate to each other through various digital environments, showcases a profound reflection\nbetween the dynamics of social media and the real world as Social Media platforms do\nnot merely mirror offline interactions but actively shape and influence them, creating a\nfeedback loop where digital behaviors and real-world actions continuously interact. The\npersonalized and decentralized nature of connective action on social media means that\nmovements and trends emerging online can quickly manifest in tangible societal changes.\nThis interplay is evidenced by the rapid mobilization of social movements, the spread of\ninformation (and misinformation), and the formation of echo chambers that reinforce\nexisting beliefs and attitudes (Sunstein, 2017). This interaction between online and offline\nbehaviors underscores the critical role of social media in contemporary political and\nsocial dynamics, reinforcing the importance of studying these platforms through\nadvanced computational methods such as TDA and AI to capture the complexities of\nmodern human interaction.\n\nThis shift, characterized by the connective action, underscores the role of social\nmedia as a dynamic mirror of societal engagement, where individual actions and\ninteractions coalesce into broader social movements. In this sense, Cass Sunstein (2017)\nexamined the dual role of social media as both reflective and formative forces in\ndemocracy by noting that social media algorithms often create echo chambers that\nreinforce existing biases leading to greater political polarization \u2013 a phenomena identified\nin several democracies across the globe, and observed in the scope of my work (2023,\n2024a, 2024b) by shapes that could be potentially described through different gaussian-\nfunction configurations. In this sense, Sanches and Silva (2023) also addressed the\nimplications of digital technologies for social participation and political engagement by\nhighlighting the potential of digital tools to enhance civic participation, while also noting\nthe challenges of ensuring inclusive and accessible digital governance."}, {"title": null, "content": "Finally, Rhukuzage (2020) explored the transformative impact of social media on\nsociological research, delving into the distinctions between digital sociology and the\nsociology of the digital. He argued that the integration of digital tools and methodologies\nis essential for capturing the complexities of contemporary social dynamics. In this sense,\nSocial Media, as a looking glass, offers a critical vantage point for understanding how\ndigital phenomena influence social structures and behaviors. Vazquez (2022) also\nemphasized the methodological challenges and opportunities in modeling social media\nphenomena by highlighting the importance of integrating computational tools and big\ndata analytics to uncover hidden patterns within social media data.\n\nTherefore, it is worth reviewing a few concepts stemming from the behaviorist\nsciences as they dabble into cultural research\nparticularly as the concepts of\nMetacontingency, Culturo-Behavioral Lineage and Cultural Transmission,\nMacrobehavior, Macrocontingency and Cultural Cusps (Glenn et. Al, 2016).\nMetacontingency refers to the interrelated contingencies that produce aggregate\noutcomes, such as societal trends or collective behaviors, influenced by environmental\nselecting conditions. In the context of social media, Metacontingencies can explain how\ncertain behaviors and ideas gain prominence and reinforcement within online\ncommunities. This concept involves the transmission of operant behaviors through\nindividual repertoires over time, forming a lineage of cultural practices. On platforms like\nTwitter, behaviors such as tweeting and retweeting create a lineage of cultural norms and\nvalues shared within a community (Rocha, 2024). Traditionally, cultural transmission is\nthe process through which behaviors, practices, and beliefs are passed from one\ngeneration to another.\n\nMacrobehavior refers to socially learned operant behaviors common within a\ngroup or society, reinforced by consistent operant contingencies. On social media,\nMacrobehaviors manifest as persistent interaction patterns, such as echo chambers, where\nusers engage in repetitive behaviors that reinforce group cohesion and polarization. As\nfor Macrocontingency, this concept describes how individual or group behaviors can lead\nto significant societal changes, representing the cumulative effect of many operant\nbehaviors. In social media, Macrocontingencies illustrate how collective behaviors, even\nwhen driven by diverse contingencies, accumulate to produce substantial social impacts.\nFinally, a Cultural Cusp represents a confluence of unique behavioral contingencies that\nresult in significant sociocultural changes."}, {"title": null, "content": "These designations are, by their own definition, useful for employment in\nadvanced methodologies \u2013 such as TDA. While there have been a few works addressing\nthe use of TDA for psychological studies, such as: autism detection, by employing a\nfeature extraction technique based on TDA in order to classify autistic subjects from\ntypically developing ones during a visual cognitive task (Majumder et al., 2020); well-\nbeing, by investigating remote work travel experiences using topological analysis on\nInstagram posts to reveal distinct elements that influence well-being (Chevtaeva et. Al,\n2023); and the understanding of psychosis, by exploring methodological expansions in\npsychometrics to evaluate the topological structure of psychotic experiences and assess\nlongitudinal changes (Argolo et. Al, 2020), there have been few studies seeking to\nilluminate Macrobehaviors, Macrocontingencies, and Cultural Cusps in large social-\nmedia derived datasets as well as when or how psychological and political trends could\nbe predicted through TDA.\n\nIn this sense, the behaviorist approach, connected to TDA-powered computational\npolitical analysis, might be instrumental in realizing the concept of Psychohistory, as, by\nleveraging the systematic and pragmatic nature of behaviorism, researchers can develop\nmore accurate models for predicting political and societal trends. For example,\nMacrobehavior, or the persistent interaction patterns within a group, can be analyzed with\nTDA to identify stable topological features that indicate cohesive group behavior. This\ncan be particularly useful in understanding the dynamics of political factions and\npredicting their long-term stability and responses to external events. Macrocontingencies,\nthe cumulative effects of individual or group behaviors that lead to significant societal\nimpacts could also be studied through TDA as, by mapping these identified\nMacrocontingencies as nodes inside an inherent network, researchers can predict large-\nscale political and social changes, such as shifts in public opinion or the emergence of\nnew political movements. Finally, as Cultural Cusps represent critical points where\nunique behavioral contingencies converge to create significant sociocultural changes,\nTDA could help identify these pivotal moments by highlighting the interactions that lead\nto transformative political and social phenomena.\n\nThis all could potentially allow for the anticipation of major shifts in the political\nlandscape. By integrating these behaviorist concepts with TDA, researchers can develop\nrobust predictive models that capture the complexity of social media interactions and their\nbroader societal impacts.

Thus, the previously defined concept of the Ruliad not only enriches the\ntheoretical underpinnings of this study but also lays a concrete foundation for the practical\napplication of computational methods in forecasting social behavior. This intersection of\nadvanced computational theories and practical data analysis techniques marks a\nsignificant step forward in the field of the Computational Social Sciences, opening new\navenues for research and application.\n\nAs previously stated, social media data will be inherently modeled through\nnetworks, however researchers must now stretch their perspective towards TDA as to\nenable more refined predictive or analysis models. Serrano, Serrano, and G\u00f3mez's work\n(2020) offers profound arguments in favor of this shift as their study critiques the\nlimitations of standard graph-based methods that only account for pairwise interactions,\narguing for the inclusion of higher-order interactions inherent in real-world networks\nwhich also happen to be present in social media networks. The authors propose an\nadvanced mathematical framework using simplicial complexes to capture these multi-\nagent interactions, which cannot be adequately represented by conventional network\ntheory.\n\nThis is because simplicial complexes allow for the examination of structures\nwhere interactions among three or more agents are common, an approach that provides a\nricher and more nuanced understanding of connectivity in complex networks. The\nintroduction of multi-parameter boundary and coboundary operators facilitates the\ncomputation of higher-order degrees of adjacency, enhancing our ability to analyze the\nstructural properties of networks across various domains. This methodological"}, {"title": null, "content": "advancement is particularly relevant to the study of social media data, where the intricate\nweb of interactions extends beyond simple pairwise relationships. In other words, by\nemploying the concept of higher-order degrees, such as maximal upper simplicial degree\nand general adjacency degree, it is possible to uncover hidden patterns of collaboration\nand influence within social media networks. This approach aligns seamlessly with my\nresearch, where TDA is utilized to reveal the underlying structures of social media\ninteractions, offering a more comprehensive view of societal dynamics.\n\nMoreover, the work of Serrano et al. underscores the importance of distinguishing\nbetween different types of simplicial adjacency, such as lower and upper adjacency, to\naccurately model the complexity of social interactions. This distinction is crucial for\ndeveloping predictive models that can account for the multi-faceted nature of human\nbehavior and social influence, ultimately enhancing the precision of our forecasts.\nIntegrating these advanced topological methods with Machine Learning techniques not\nonly improves our analytical capabilities but also addresses the inherent challenges of\nprocessing and interpreting vast amounts of high-dimensional data.\n\nBy leveraging the robust framework provided by TDA and the innovative\ntechniques proposed by Serrano and colleagues, we can move closer to actualizing the\nvision of Psychohistory, where the prediction of large-scale social behaviors becomes a\nfeasible scientific endeavor. In this context, Arfi's (2024) groundbreaking work on the\nuse of Persistent Homology, Machine Learning, and deep neural networks in topological\ndata analysis of democracy survival provides a compelling example of how these\nadvanced methodologies can be applied to social sciences \u2013 particularly, political science.\nArfi's research employs TDA to uncover topological invariants within high-dimensional\ndatasets, using Persistent Homology to identify features such as one-dimensional loops\nthat persist across scales. By integrating these topological features into Bayesian survival\nanalysis models through functional principal component analysis (FPCA), Arfi\ndemonstrates their significant impact on explaining variance in survival data. His\nempirical analysis of democracy survival from 1950 to 2010, which includes multi-frailty\nsurvival analysis to account for recurrent democratic breakdowns, reveals that topological\nfeatures are as critical as traditional covariates like civil society and party\ninstitutionalization, aligning with my findings regarding the use of social media data\nanalysis as means for understanding societal trends such as political polarization and\npolitical personalism (Rocha, 2023, 2024)."}, {"title": "Topological Data Analysis pilots", "content": "Arfi's integration of TDA with Machine Learning and Bayesian approaches\nprovides a robust framework for analyzing high-dimensional data, highlighting the global\ntopological structures that traditional methods might overlook.

In this subsection, we shall\ninvestigate how the behaviorist perspective might be understood in previously collected\ndata, leading us to the proposition of an actual workflow.\n\nThe process begins with automated data extraction from various social media\nplatforms, utilizing web scraping tools and APIs. This step ensures the collection of vast\ndatasets encompassing diverse types of content interactions, such as posts, comments,\nlikes, and shares, as well as other significant metadata. Following data collection, the next\nphase involves applying TDA to the network structures inherent in social media data. By\nrepresenting interactions as networks with nodes (users) and edges (interactions), TDA is\nemployed to extract significant topological features. Toolkits have been developed for\nSocial Media data scraping, from Twitter (Rocha, 2023, 2024a, 2024b), to Telegram\n(Rocha, Silva, Vicentini, 2024) \u2013 and will continue to be developed as to enable this\nresearch.

The identification of these structures might provide a basis for\nMachine Learning models to predict changes in Macrobehaviors."}, {"title": null, "content": "The approach to identifying Metacontingency could potentially involve the use of\nTDA to pinpoint persistent topological features in the network that correspond to\ncollective behavioral patterns. These features \u2013 and the content present in these nodes\nwould then fed into machine learning algorithms, which are then trained to recognize\nthese patterns and predict their evolution over time. To analyze culturo-behavioral lineage\nand cultural transmission, NLP techniques could be potentially applied to the textual\ncontent to detect patterns indicative of cultural transmission \u2013 but of course, heavily\nsupervised by researchers. TDA would then be used to map the evolution of these\nbehaviors within the network. In this sense, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long\nShort-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) could also be suitable for modeling the temporal\ndynamics of cultural transmission in social media interactions, capturing how these\nbehaviors propagate and evolve over time, but this would require another particular\nresearch altogether.\n\nAs for the Macrocontingencies, TDA might be employed to map these cumulative\nbehaviors as nodes within the network. Machine learning models could be used to predict\nlarge-scale societal impacts resulting from these Macrocontingencies, and Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) would be particularly well-suited for processing and analyzing the\nnetwork-based representations of Macrocontingencies, allowing for a detailed\nunderstanding of how individual behaviors aggregate to produce substantial social\nchanges. Finally, as Cultural Cusps represent critical points where unique behavioral\ncontingencies converge to create significant sociocultural changes, TDA might used to\nhighlight interactions that lead to transformative political and social phenomena,\nidentifying these pivotal moments within the data, as well as the actors or the specific\ncontent that culminates in the consolidation of a Cultural Cusp.\n\nIn this sense, it is wise to consider the role played by network gatekeepers, as they\nplay a crucial role in directing the flow of information and attention within social media\nnetworks (Garimella, et. Al, 2018). By strategically filtering and amplifying certain\nnarratives, gatekeepers influence the formation and intensification of polarization.\nGatekeepers, by selectively curating content, can accelerate the development of\nMacrocontingencies and Cultural Cusps by emphasizing divisive or emotionally charged\ntopics.

Hybrid\nmodels that combine TDA-derived features with deep learning techniques might, then, be\nparticularly effective in enhancing the prediction of cultural cusps, ensuring that subtle\nbut significant shifts in social behavior are accurately identified and anticipated.\n\nTherefore, a feasible model inspired in Asimov's vision could potentially be\nemployed by relating Persistent Homologies to the concepts designed by the behaviorist\napproach. In my research, I have identified three Persistent Homologies categories, such\nas Nuclear, Bipolar, and Multipolar Constellations (2024a), which could closely correlate\nwith the behaviorist concepts of Macrobehavior, Macrocontingency, and Cultural Cusps.\n\nNuclear Constellations, for instance, represent tightly-knit clusters within social\nmedia networks that exhibit strong, cohesive interactions over time. These constellations\nmight mirror the concept of Macrobehavior, where persistent interaction patterns within\na group reinforce group cohesion and possibly worsen a scenario of political polarization\nthough such a statement would require further exploration. It must be disclaimed,\nhowever, that in the scope of my pilot research, these Nuclear Constellation indicated\nprocesses of Political Personalism. Regardless, by analyzing these Nuclear Constellations\nthrough TDA, it is possible to identify stable topological features that indicate cohesive\ngroup behavior, providing information into the dynamics of political factions and their\nlong-term stability. Moreover, the concept of Macrocontingencies also directly applies to\nNuclear Constellations, as they encapsulate the aggregated effects of numerous individual\nactions converging towards a central point of influence. In a Nuclear Constellation, the\ncentral cluster is a manifestation of these Macrocontingencies, where the collective\nbehaviors of individuals coalesce around a pivotal topic or influential figure. This\naggregation not only amplifies the impact of the central theme but also reinforces the\nbehaviors and interactions within the group, creating a powerful feedback loop. The echo\nchamber effect observed in Nuclear Constellations further exemplifies\nMacrocontingencies at work.

In the\ncontext of Nuclear Constellations, these cusps can be seen as the moments when a\nparticular topic, event, or influential figure suddenly garners widespread attention,\nresulting in the formation of a dense, central cluster of interactions. For instance, a viral\nevent or a significant political announcement can act as a Cultural Cusp, around which a\nNuclear Constellation forms, indicating a concentrated and cohesive response from the\nonline community. By analyzing the timing and context of these clusters, researchers can\nidentify the key moments that triggered significant shifts in public discourse and\nengagement, reflecting the impact of Cultural Cusps.\n\nNuclear Constellations can, overtime, evolve into Bipolar Constellations. In\nBipolar Constellations, Cultural Cusps can be associated with events or issues that sharply\ndivide public opinion, leading to the formation of two opposing clusters and the\ngatekeepers involved in the narrative stream split. These cusps might include polarizing\npolitical events, contentious social issues, or influential media reports that provoke strong\nreactions from different segments of the population (Rocha, 2023). The emergence of\nBipolar Constellations around these cusps highlights the points of divergence in societal\nviews or political personalism and the subsequent polarization. By studying the\nformation and evolution of these Bipolar Constellations, it is possible to pinpoint the\nCultural Cusps that catalyzed the division and analyze how these moments contribute to\nthe broader landscape of political polarization.\n\nBipolar Constellations exhibit two dense clusters of data points, representing\nopposing areas of interaction or discussion.

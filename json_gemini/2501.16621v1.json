The framework consists of four core modules: (1) A four-channel parallel encoder that processes technical indicators, financial text, macro data, and event knowledge graph respectively for independent feature extraction of multi-modal data; (2) A dynamic gated cross-modal fusion mechanism that adaptively learns the importance of different modalities through differentiable weight allocation for effective information integration; (3) A time-aligned mixed-frequency processing layer that uses an innovative position encoding method to effectively fuse data of different time frequencies and solves the time alignment problem of heterogeneous data; (4) A graph attention-based event impact quantification module that captures the dynamic impact of events on the market through event knowledge graph and quantifies the event impact coefficient. We introduce a hybrid-frequency Transformer and Event2Vec algorithm to effectively fuse data of different frequencies and quantify the event impact. Experimental results show that in the prediction task of CSI 300 constituent stocks, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the MMF-Trans framework is reduced by 23.7% compared to the baseline model, the event response prediction accuracy is improved by 41.2%, and the Sharpe ratio is improved by 32.6%. The theoretical contribution is that we establish a quantitative evaluation system for the impact of political events and demonstrate the convergence of the model through mathematical proof, while solving the technical problem of heterogeneous data frequency alignment. In addition, we elaborate on the deployment and application of the model in a real intelligent investment research platform, and conduct a quantitative impact analysis of the \"carbon neutrality\" policy, providing valuable reference for policy makers and investors.\nKeywords: Multi-modal Learning; Transformer; Stock Prediction; Mixed-Frequency Processing; Event Impact Quantification; Financial Time Series Analysis; Deep Learning; Graph Neural Network", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1 Research Background and Problem Statement", "content": "Stock market prediction has always been a core research topic in the financial field, and its complexity and uncertainty have attracted the attention of many researchers. Traditional financial theories, such as the efficient market hypothesis [1], believe that stock prices are an immediate reflection of all available information. However, the real stock market is full of non-linearity, time-variability, and noise, and single-modal analysis methods often fail to capture market dynamics. Especially in the Chinese stock market, its high policy sensitivity and strong information asymmetry further increase the difficulty of prediction. Traditional prediction models based on single technical indicators or financial data often fail to effectively integrate macroeconomic information, policy events, and other information, resulting in low prediction accuracy, which is difficult to meet the needs of investors and regulators.\nSpecifically, we face the following challenges:\n1. Information Heterogeneity: There are significant differences in frequency, format, and semantics between technical indicators (minute-level or daily), financial reports (quarterly), macro data (monthly/quarterly), and sudden events (unstructured text). How to effectively integrate these heterogeneous information is a difficult problem. For example, minute-level trading data reflects market micro fluctuations, while quarterly financial reports provide fundamental information about the company, macroeconomic data reflects the overall economic environment, and policy events may trigger sharp market fluctuations."}, {"title": "2. Lag in Event Response:", "content": "Existing models often lag in responding to external shocks such as policy changes and sudden events, and cannot capture short-term market fluctuations in a timely manner, which is particularly prominent in the policy-oriented Chinese stock market. For example, after the announcement of a new environmental policy, the market may take some time to fully reflect its impact, and existing models often fail to capture this dynamic change."}, {"title": "3. Lack of Dynamic Coupling:", "content": "The non-linear relationship between macroeconomic trends and micro-market signals is complex, and traditional linear models cannot effectively model it, requiring more advanced non-linear modeling methods. For example, in a period of economic prosperity, the market may be sensitive to positive news, while in a period of economic recession, the market may react more strongly to negative news."}, {"title": "4. Impact Quantification:", "content": "How to accurately quantify the impact of policy events, sudden events, etc. on the stock market and incorporate them into the prediction model remains a challenge. For example, how to quantify the impact of the \"carbon neutrality\" policy on different industries, and the duration of this impact, are current research difficulties.\nAccording to the statistics of the CSMAR database, from 2015 to 2022, about 32.7% of the abnormal fluctuations in the price of CSI 300 constituent stocks were directly related to policy events, but the explanatory power of existing models is insufficient (R2 \u00a1 0.15), which indicates that existing models have significant deficiencies in capturing event impact. Therefore, how to build a prediction framework that can effectively integrate multi-modal information and accurately quantify event impact is the key to improving the prediction accuracy of the Chinese stock market, and it is also an important problem that needs to be solved in the financial field."}, {"title": "1.2 Innovation and Contributions", "content": "To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an innovative Multi-Modal Transformer framework (MMF-Trans), whose main contributions are reflected in the following five aspects:\n1. Four-Modal Fusion Architecture: For the first time, the information of four modalities, technical indicators (T), financial text (F), macro data (M), and event graph (E), are integrated into an end-to-end prediction system, realizing the effective fusion of multi-source heterogeneous information and making full use of the complementarity of different modal data.\n2. Time Alignment Mechanism: A hybrid-frequency Transformer layer is proposed, which solves the time alignment problem of data with different frequencies such as minute-level price data, quarterly financial reports, and monthly macro data through an innovative three-stage position encoding method, and gives a theoretical proof (see Section 3.1), providing new ideas for time series analysis of heterogeneous data.\n3. Event Quantification Method: The Event2Vec algorithm is developed, which realizes the dynamic propagation modeling of policy impact through the event knowledge graph, quantifies the specific impact of events on the stock market, and proposes the concept of event impact coefficient, providing a new tool for policy impact assessment.\n4. Robustness Guarantee: A dynamic distribution adaptation module is designed to ensure the stable performance of the model during the bull-bear market transition period by adaptively adjusting the model parameters, which reduces the annualized volatility by 18.2% and improves the generalization ability of the model.\n5. Theoretical Breakthrough: The global convergence of the model under the Lipschitz continuity condition is strictly proved (Theorem 3.1), which provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness and stability of the model and provides theoretical support for the application of deep learning models in the financial field."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Overall Architecture Design", "content": "The MMF-Trans framework consists of three core components: input encoding layer, fusion inference layer, and prediction decoding layer."}, {"title": "2.2 Four-Channel Encoder", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.2.1 Technical Indicator Channel", "content": "The technical indicator channel aims to extract the time series characteristics of stock prices. We adopt a hybrid architecture of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture patterns at different time scales. The wavelet transform can decompose the time series into different frequency sub-bands, while TCN is good at processing time series data. Specifically, we use the following formula:\n$h = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} DWT_k(W_{dil}^{k} * X_T)$ (1)\nwhere $X_T$ represents the technical indicator input at time t, including opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, trading volume, etc., $W_{dil}^{k}$ represents the dilated convolution kernel corresponding to the k-th wavelet decomposition layer, $DWT_k$ represents the k-th wavelet decomposition operation, K=4 is the wavelet decomposition level, and the expansion factor d increases exponentially (d = $2^i$, i = 0,1,2,3). In this way, the model can simultaneously capture high-frequency and low-frequency market fluctuations."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Financial Text Channel", "content": "The financial text channel aims to extract semantic information from financial reports and integrate it with stock features. We first build a domain-adaptive pre-trained model FinBERT-Chinese, the specific steps are:\nFinBERT-Chinese = BERTbase + FinVocab(5.2M) (2)\nwhere BERTbase is the basic BERT model [7], and FinVocab (5.2M) is a domain vocabulary containing 5.2 million financial words. Through pre-training on a large amount of text data in the financial field, FinBERT-Chinese can better understand the professional terms and semantic information in financial reports. Then, we use the cross-attention mechanism to realize the fusion of text features and stock features:\nCrossAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax($\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$)V (3)\nwhereQ represents the query matrix, which comes from stock features, K and V represent the key matrix and value matrix respectively, which come from financial text features, and dk represents the dimension of the key matrix. The cross-attention mechanism can make the model focus on the part of the financial text that is related to the stock characteristics, thereby achieving more effective feature fusion."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Macro Data Channel", "content": "The macro data channel is designed to handle macro-economic data of varying frequencies. We design a mixed-frequency LSTM (MF-LSTM) module that can process data with different time intervals. Specifically, we use the following formula:\n$c_t^{(q)}$ = LSTM($X_{macro}^{(q)}; c_t^{(q)}$) (4)\nwhere $X_{macro}$ represents the input of the q-th macroeconomic indicator at time t, including GDP growth rate, CPI, interest rate, M2, etc., $c_t^{(q)}$ represents the hidden state of the q-th macroeconomic indicator at time t, and represents the time interval of quarterly data. In order to align with the daily data, we use linear interpolation to process the quarterly data. In addition, we also introduce a time decay factor to allow the model to focus on recent macroeconomic data."}, {"title": "2.2.4 Event Knowledge Channel", "content": "The event knowledge channel is designed to encode the event knowledge graph and capture the correlation between events. We use the Graph Attention Network (GAT) to process the event knowledge graph, where nodes represent events and edges represent relationships between events. GAT can adaptively learn the importance of different nodes, so as to better capture the influence between events. Specifically, we use the following formula:\n$A_{ij} = \\frac{exp(LeakyReLU(a^T [Wh_i||Wh_j]))}{\\sum_{k\\in N_i} exp(LeakyReLU(a^T [Wh_i||Wh_k]))}$ (5)\n$h_i^{'} = \\sigma (\\sum_{j \\in N_i} \\alpha_{ij} Wh_j )$ (6)\nwhere hi represents the feature vector of node i, a represents the attention vector, W represents the weight matrix, Ni represents the neighbor nodes of node i, and \u03c3 represents the activation function. Through GAT, the model can learn the interaction between events, so as to more accurately quantify the impact of events on the market."}, {"title": "2.3 Dynamic Gated Fusion", "content": "To integrate information from different modalities, we designed a dynamic gated fusion module. The module adaptively learns the importance of different modalities through a differentiable weight allocation mechanism. Specifically, we use the following formula:\n$\\alpha_k = \\frac{exp(w_k^Th_k)}{\\sum_{i=1}^4 exp(w_i^Th_i)}$ (7)\nwhere $h_k$ represents the encoded output of the k-th modality, and $w_k$ represents the weight vector of the k-th modality. These weight vectors are learned through backpropagation to ensure that the modality importance is adaptively adjusted. For example, during periods of high market volatility, the importance of technical indicators may increase, while when a company releases important financial reports, the importance of financial text may increase."}, {"title": "2.4 Time-Aligned Transformer", "content": "The Time-Aligned Transformer is designed to solve the time alignment problem of data with different frequencies. We innovatively introduce three-stage position encoding:\n1. Calendar Encoding: Captures the periodic patterns of the time series, for example, trading days and weekends within a week, and seasonal changes within a year. We use sine and cosine functions to encode timestamps to capture the periodic features of the time series.\n2. Event Encoding: Marks the time points of important events such as policy releases, so that the model can focus on the impact of these events. We use Gaussian kernel functions to encode event time points, so that the model can focus on the time of occurrence of events and the decay of event impact.\n3. Decay Encoding: Models the time decay of event impact, for example, the impact of a policy may weaken over time. We use an exponential decay function to encode the time decay of event impact, so that the model can focus on the long-term impact of the event.\nThe position encoding function is:\nPosEnc(t) = $\\sum_{m=1}^{3} \\gamma_mEncm (t)$ (8)\nwhere Encm(t) represents the m-th position encoding, and ym is the learnable decay coefficient. Through this three-stage position encoding, the model can effectively process data of different frequencies and capture complex patterns in the time series."}, {"title": "3 Theoretical Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Convergence Proof", "content": "In order to ensure the effectiveness and stability of the model, we prove the global convergence of the model under the Lipschitz continuity condition.\nTheorem 3.1: Let the loss function L(\u03b8) satisfy:\n1.

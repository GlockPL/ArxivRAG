Many existing datasets lack adequate representation of different groups, resulting in unreliable assessments. To tackle this, we propose a socio-culturally aware evaluation framework for LLM-driven content moderation and introduce a scalable method for creating diverse datasets using persona-based generation. Our analysis reveals that these datasets provide broader perspectives and pose greater challenges for LLMs than diversity-focused generation methods without personas. This challenge is especially pronounced in smaller LLMs, emphasizing the difficulties they encounter in moderating such diverse content.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The rapid proliferation of social media platforms has significantly amplified the spread of hate speech, misinformation, and harmful content, presenting an urgent need for robust content moderation mechanisms (Udanor and Anyanwu, 2019; Del Vigna12 et al., 2017). Over time, content moderation has evolved from rule-based systems to sophisticated machine learning models, with transformer architectures at the forefront (Caselli et al., 2021). Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2023; Abdin et al., 2024) have emerged as state-of-the-art tools, demonstrating impressive performance in detecting a wide array of harmful content, including hate speech (Plaza-del arco et al., 2023; Chiu et al., 2022), misinformation (Hu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a), self-harm-related language (Al-hamed et al., 2024), and explicit sexual material (Nguyen et al., 2023).\nDespite their promise, the evaluation of LLMs for content moderation is hampered by critical shortcomings in the datasets used for testing. Many existing datasets lack diversity, are unevenly distributed across demographic groups, and often suffer from noisy annotations (Mathew et al., 2021; Diggelmann et al., 2021; Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Yin and Zubiaga, 2021; Yu et al., 2024). Furthermore, these datasets frequently underrepresent or misrepresent sensitive demographic groups, limiting their ability to provide a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance (Lee et al., 2023a,b; Zhang et al., 2024; Haimson et al., 2021). This issue is compounded by recent findings that LLMS exhibit high false positive rates when moderating content related to sensitive or marginalized groups (Zhang et al., 2024).\nA key challenge lies in the semantic and linguistic variability of content across diverse demographic groups, influenced by factors such as region, religion, and age (Lee et al., 2023a,b). Current datasets fail to capture these variations adequately, leading to blind spots in the evaluation of LLM-based content moderation systems. This gap underscores the urgent need for high-quality, diverse datasets that can facilitate a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs' limitations and capabilities in moderating harmful content.\nTo overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, we introduce a socio-culturally aware framework for evaluating LLM-based content moderation systems, focusing on four critical areas: hate speech, misinformation, sexual content, and self-harm. This framework facilitates the generation of diverse,"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Existing hate speech and misinformation datasets often suffer from label imbalance, linguistic homogeneity, and annotation biases. Many are sourced from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, where subjectivity and limited annotator expertise lead to noise and mislabeling (Jaf and Barakat, 2024; Kuntur et al., 2024; Yin and Zubiaga, 2021). Over-reliance on majority-vote aggregation (Thorne et al., 2018; Diggelmann et al., 2021) and a narrow focus on specific ideological or minority groups (ElSherief et al., 2021; Hartvigsen et al., 2022) exacerbate bias and reduce generalizability. Such limitations disproportionately associate toxicity with minority mentions (Sap et al., 2020; Wiegand et al., 2021; Davidson et al., 2019), resulting in biased models that lack socio-cultural awareness.\nWhile LLMs have shown promise in content moderation (Kumar et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024) and fake news detection (Koka et al., 2024), challenges persist in handling implicit hate and nuanced misinformation. Studies highlight limitations in crowd-sourced annotations (Li et al., 2024), overemphasis on accuracy (Huang, 2024), and variability in model responses to culturally-conditioned prompts (Mukherjee et al., 2024). Persona-based methods (Kwok et al., 2024; T\u00f6rnberg et al., 2023) have shown potential in improving alignment by emulating diverse user perspectives."}, {"title": "3 Dataset Generation", "content": "In this section, we propose a 2-step method to generate a diverse and precise dataset that will allow for the thorough evaluation of content moderation systems using LLMs. First, we hypothesize that the generation of content can be varied and controlled along three key dimensions: Task, Target, and Type. Secondly, we use this generated data to create a socio-culturally rich and varied dataset using LLM personas to ensure that LLM-based content moderation systems are robust across various contexts."}, {"title": "3.1 Diversity-focused Generation", "content": "Our approach for generating a diverse dataset focuses on varying the content across these three dimensions: Task, Target, and Type. This enables us to address different aspects of content moderation and evaluate how well LLMS handle the moderation of complex and varied content. The data generation pipeline, depicted in Figure 1, utilizes GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) to generate content across these dimensions.\nTask: The Task dimension represents the major areas of content moderation that we focus on. We identify five primary tasks, each"}, {"title": "3.2 Persona-driven Generation", "content": "By building upon the diverse data generated in the previous diversity-focused generation step, this approach ensures that content moderation systems are evaluated in a way that reflects the complexity of real-world social dynamics. For each input statement generated in the diversity-focused step, we introduce the concept of a Persona. Each Persona represents a set of socio-cultural attributes, such as age, gender, religion, and nationality, among others. When given an input statement and a corresponding Persona, the LLM generates an Opinion, which indicates either Persona Agreement (PA) or Persona Disagreement (PD) with the content, formatted as a social media post (e.g., a Twitter or Reddit post, as shown in Figure 1).\nWe format the generated content as a Twitter or Reddit post to replicate real social media conversations, where demographic and socio-cultural factors heavily influence the tone, framing, and content of discussions. Studies show that LLMs can mimic real human behavior in social media interactions by utilizing persona-based generation techniques (Radivojevic et al., 2024). Furthermore, toxic content on social media is often shaped by users' demographics, beliefs, and personal experiences, which our framework aims to capture and incorporate into the generated content (Kumar et al., 2021). We exclude SLHM-GEN and SXL-GEN from this persona-based generation approach, as societal biases tend to have a lesser impact on these topics compared to others.\nPersona Attributes: Following the methodology in (Yukhymenko et al., 2024), we define a set of Persona attributes to model different perspectives, particularly for the HATE-GEN task. These attributes include age, gender, religion, nationality, and profession, as shown in Table 2. We randomly selected 19 diverse personas, with a particular focus on marginalized and underrepresented groups, to ensure inclusivity in the generated dataset (cf. Tables 20, 21, and 22). For each Persona, if their opinion aligns with the content, it is labeled as HATE-PA (Persona Agreement), and if it disagrees, it is labeled as HATE-PD (Persona Disagreement)."}, {"title": "4 Content Moderation using LLMs", "content": "Building on the diverse datasets generated in the previous section, we evaluate the performance of LLMs across five key content moderation categories: Hate, Misinformation, Safe, Sexual, and Self-Harm. To assess the models' effectiveness, we use zero-shot prompts (cf A.5) to classify each input statement into one of these categories, leveraging the data generated through both diversity-focused and persona-driven approaches. This allows us to examine how well LLMs can handle diverse, culturally nuanced content and identify their limitations in moderating sensitive material across varying contexts. By testing LLMs on this rich, diverse dataset, we aim to uncover how demographic biases and cultural differences influence moderation outcomes."}, {"title": "5 Experimental Setup & Results", "content": "Implementation Details: We experiment with five generative models: GPT-3-xl (text-davinci-002), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), ChatGPT, Mistral (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2), and Phi3 (Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct). To mitigate potential biases arising from using models"}, {"title": "6 Qualitative Analysis of Persona", "content": "Variation in perspectives: Figure 3 demonstrates the nuanced diversity in perspectives across different personas. These variations are influenced not only by professional roles but also by demographic attributes such as gender.\nFor instance, in the Hate-PA task, the Asian male persona (Figure 3a) employs stereotypical phrases like \"slanted eyes,\" whereas the Asian female persona (Figure 3b) uses more neutral or positive language, emphasizing concepts such as \"culture\" and \"values.\" Similarly, for the MIS-GEN task, professional differences are evident: the Environmental Activist persona (Figure 3c) focuses on terms such as \"5G,\u201d \"planet,\u201d and \"energy,\u201d aligning with sustainability concerns. In contrast, the Scientist persona (Figure 3d) highlights topics like \"technology\" and \"COVID-19,\" reflecting a technical and public health focus. An analysis of shared vocabulary across personas (refer to Figure 6 in the Appendix) reveals less than 50% overlap, highlighting the distinct linguistic and conceptual framing shaped by their demographic and professional contexts.\nAnalysis on Influence of Persona: We investigate the influence of persona on content generation by examining GPT-4 Turbo's ability to predict personal attributes associated with a given statement (Staab et al., 2024). To minimize hallucinations and improve the reliability of predictions, we provide five distinct statements generated from the same persona. The accuracy of these predictions reflects the extent to which each persona attribute influences the content generation process, with higher accuracy indicating a stronger influence. Results are visualized in Figures 2a and 2b, and attributes with less than 5% prediction accuracy are excluded from the analysis.\nFor the HATE-GEN task, attributes such as Immigrant Status and Age Group exhibit the highest influence, with prediction accuracies ex-"}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "We present a novel framework and benchmark for generating diverse datasets for content moderation using LLMs, eliminating the need for human annotation. By incorporating personas, our method introduces a wide range of socio-cultural perspectives on hate speech and misinformation. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs can generate diverse content effectively, their performance in detecting hate speech and misinformation diminishes with increased variation in persona-based data. The analysis highlights that persona attributes, such as religion, political beliefs, and societal roles, significantly"}, {"title": "8 Limitations", "content": "Our study is limited to monolingual content moderation in English. Given that harmful content and misinformation exist across many languages, and socio-cultural biases are influenced by these differences, evaluating LLM performance in multilingual settings could offer a more comprehensive view of content moderation challenges.\nFuture work should expand the number of personas to better reflect the diversity of real-world users, covering a broader spectrum of demographic, cultural, and ideological backgrounds. It should also explore few-shot prompting, fine-tuning, or alternative approaches to better evaluate these newer models in detecting hate speech and misinformation across diverse personas."}, {"title": "9 Ethical Considerations", "content": "While our primary goal is to develop more effective and inclusive content moderation systems, our methods could inadvertently enable the generation of toxic content, which poses a risk for misuse. We also recognize the risks of releasing datasets that contain offensive or harmful content. To mitigate this, we will clearly state the terms of use, emphasizing that the dataset is intended for research aimed at improving content moderation and should not be used maliciously. We strongly advocate for the responsible use of our dataset and encourage the broader community to apply it constructively, particularly for developing more inclusive and culturally sensitive moderation systems.\nWhile our approach leverages personas to generate diverse datasets, we acknowledge that bias is an inherent risk in any LLM-based system, including our synthetic generations. We have taken steps to reduce bias by using personas from various socio-cultural backgrounds. However, we understand that some biases may still persist, and we encourage future research to continue improving in this area.\nFinally, there is an ongoing risk of misuse, particularly in adversarial contexts where generated toxic content might be exploited for harm. Our goal is to empower marginalized groups by improving the detection of toxic content that targets them, rather than reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Therefore, we call for transparent and responsible usage of this technology, combined with regular ethical reviews and human oversight, to ensure these systems are used for constructive and equitable purposes."}, {"title": "A Appendix", "content": "A.1 Targets used in Diversity-focused and Persona-driven generation\nThis section presents a comprehensive classification of various entities, themes, and targets related to misinformation, adult content, hate speech, and suicide methods used in our diversity-based data generation. Table 9 outlines the different domains of misinformation, including government, health, conspiracies, and famous deaths, while Table 11 categorizes adult content entities into themes such as sexual orientation, body types, ethnicity's, and specific genres. Table 12 provides a detailed classification of targets for hate speech, spanning categories like gender, profession, race, religion, and more. Furthermore, Table 13 categorizes suicide methods into various themes such as physical harm, poisoning, drowning, and extreme environmental conditions, while Table 10 lists different scenarios used in suicide data generation (SLHM-GEN). Table 23 presents the targets used in persona-driven generation of HATE-PA and HATE-PD tasks. These tables collectively serve as a foundation for generating content across different sensitive domains.\nA.2 Diversity in Personas\nIn this section, we provide detailed information on the persons used in persona-driven data generation and present insights on the diversity. Table 19 lists all the personas used for MIS-PA, MIS-PD, FACT-PA, FACT-PD tasks, and Table 20 lists all the persons used for HATE-PA and HATE-PD.

The heatmaps illustrate the common token percentages between different user profiles, offering insights into the diversity of these personas based on their textual attributes. The scale ranges from 0.3 to 1.0, with 1.0 indicating identical words between profiles and lower values reflecting fewer shared words.

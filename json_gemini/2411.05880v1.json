{"title": "Towards Equitable ASD Diagnostics: A Comparative Study of Machine and Deep Learning Models Using Behavioral and Facial Data", "authors": ["Mohammed Aledhari", "Mohamed Rahouti", "Ali Alfatemi"], "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often underdiagnosed in females due to gender-specific symptom differences overlooked by conventional diagnostics. This study evaluates machine learning models, particularly Random Forest and convolutional neural networks, for enhancing ASD diagnosis through structured data and facial image analysis. Random Forest achieved 100% validation accuracy across datasets, highlighting its ability to manage complex relationships and reduce false negatives, which is crucial for early intervention and addressing gender biases. In image-based analysis, MobileNet outperformed the baseline CNN, achieving 87% accuracy, though a 30% validation loss suggests possible overfitting, requiring further optimization for robustness in clinical settings.

ASD affects approximately 1 in 36 children in the U.S., with boys diagnosed nearly 3.8 times more often than girls, leading to a gender-based diagnostic gap that frequently leaves females undiagnosed or misdiagnosed until later in life. Delays in detection can negatively impact long-term outcomes in communication, education, and mental health, contributing to significant economic costs; the annual financial burden of ASD in the U.S. was estimated at $268 billion in 2015, projected to reach $461 billion by 2025.\nThese societal and personal impacts underscore the importance of recognizing and understanding the core symptoms of ASD, which often vary in their presentation across individuals and can complicate timely diagnosis.\nThe underdiagnosis of ASD in females can be attributed to several factors. Diagnostic criteria for ASD, which have been largely derived from studies focusing on male populations, may not adequately capture the more subtle or socially masked manifestations of the condition seen in females. Many females engage in \"camouflaging,\" a strategy involving the suppression or masking of autistic traits in social settings, making clinical detection more challenging. Furthermore, existing diagnostic tools may not be sufficiently sensitive to gender-specific presentations of ASD, resulting in significant diagnostic delays. On average, females are diagnosed with ASD later in life than males, with some remaining undiagnosed well into adulthood.\nSeveral theoretical models have attempted to explain these gender differences in autism presentation. The Female Autism Phenotype (FAP) theory suggests that females exhibit different behavioral characteristics compared to males, which may influence their diagnosis [2]. Similarly, the Female Protective Effect (FPE) posits that females require a higher genetic or environmental burden to display comparable autistic traits as males [3]. Another influential theory, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) hypothesis, posits that ASD may exaggerate cognitive patterns typically associated with males, driven by higher androgen levels [4]. However, recent research has questioned the link between androgen levels and autism, highlighting the complexity of these theoretical frameworks.\nGiven these challenges, there is an urgent need for diagnostic tools that are more sensitive to the unique presentation of ASD in females. While traditional clinical methods are helpful, they may not fully capture the complexity of the condition, particularly in underdiagnosed populations. Advances in machine learning (ML) offer a promising solution. ML techniques can analyze large, complex datasets to detect patterns that may elude human evaluators, making them particularly suitable for identifying subtle differences in ASD presentations across genders. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of ML in diagnosing ASD and differentiating it from other neurodevelopmental conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the potential for ML to specifically improve diagnosis in females has been underexplored.\nThis study aims to address this gap by leveraging ML models to enhance the accuracy of ASD diagnosis in females. By applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to facial image data and traditional classifiers to behavioral data, we aim to identify gender-specific patterns that could improve early detection in females. Face detection, a sub-field of computer vision, holds particular promise for this task, as facial features may differ between males and females with ASD, offering new biological insights. Although previous studies in this area have focused primarily on male subjects, this study seeks to extend these techniques to female populations, providing a novel approach to reducing the diagnostic gender gap.\nIn summary, current clinical guidelines for ASD diagnosis, mainly based on male presentations, are inconsistently applied, which disproportionately impacts females. ML, mainly when applied to facial and behavioral data, holds the potential to provide a scalable, objective, and sensitive method for diagnosing ASD in females. By evaluating the performance of various ML models across multiple datasets, this study seeks to improve early diagnosis and address the long-standing gender disparity in ASD detection."}, {"title": "1.1 Research Problem", "content": "ASD affects individuals across all genders, yet early diagnosis is essential for ensuring timely access to intervention, support, and tailored treatments. While early diagnosis can significantly improve long-term outcomes in communication, education, and mental health, current diagnostic tools are predominantly designed based on how ASD manifests in boys. This creates a significant gap in diagnosing females, whose symptoms may differ in presentation, often resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis [5]. These diagnostic discrepancies prevent women from receiving appropriate early interventions, which are crucial for improving quality of life and functional outcomes.\nMoreover, ASD diagnostic procedures are time-consuming and complex, often requiring multidisciplinary assessments and lengthy evaluations, which further delay access to care. Although ML has emerged as a potential tool to streamline diagnosis, relying solely on ML models is insufficient to capture the full range of ASD presentations across genders. A more integrated approach\u2014combining ML with complementary techniques\u2014is needed to ensure that gender-specific diagnostic nuances are identified and addressed effectively."}, {"title": "1.2 Purpose of Study", "content": "The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to evaluate the limitations of current ASD diagnostic tools with a particular focus on their inability to detect ASD in females, and (2) to explore how face detection techniques can be applied to improve the accuracy and timeliness of ASD diagnosis across genders. We aim to investigate which facial features are most relevant for distinguishing ASD in males and females, thereby providing new insights into the biological and genetic factors that may influence ASD presentation. Specifically, this study seeks to answer the following research question: Can combining facial feature analysis with ML models enhance the accuracy of ASD diagnosis in females compared to traditional diagnostic methods?"}, {"title": "1.3 Motivation", "content": "Accurate and timely diagnosis of ASD is crucial, as failing to diagnose ASD when it is present (a false-negative) can result in missed opportunities for early intervention, which is known to improve long-term developmental outcomes significantly. Additionally, a delayed diagnosis can leave individuals and families without necessary support and access to services. On the other hand, incorrectly diagnosing ASD (a false-positive) can lead to unnecessary treatments and diagnostic procedures, increasing emotional and financial strain on families and placing additional burdens on healthcare systems. The lack of a definitive medical test for ASD further complicates the diagnostic process, requiring clinicians to rely on observed behaviors and developmental history, which may not accurately reflect the experiences of all individuals\u2014particularly females.\nMany autistic women do not receive timely or accurate diagnoses, which hinders their ability to advocate for their needs and limits access to critical resources. Research has shown that receiving an ASD diagnosis later in life can significantly improve self-identity, mental health, and access to necessary accommodations. Our goal is to develop a more efficient and accurate method for identifying women who may be on the autism spectrum, enabling earlier intervention and empowering women to self-identify with greater confidence, even without a formal assessment."}, {"title": "1.4 Contributions", "content": "This study contributes to the growing field of ASD diagnosis by proposing an innovative approach that combines ML with face detection techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly for females. While face detection has been explored in ASD research, few studies have examined its potential to capture gender-specific diagnostic features. Our approach integrates facial analysis with ML models to provide a more nuanced understanding of ASD in males and females. By comparing a baseline CNN model with a more advanced CNN architecture, we explore the trade-offs between model complexity and diagnostic performance, offering insights into which models are most effective for this task. Our contributions include:\n\u2022\tDeveloping a hybrid approach using facial and behavioral data for ASD diagnosis.\n\u2022\tProviding a comparative analysis of different CNN models for ASD classification.\n\u2022\tHighlighting the importance of biological and genetic factors in understanding ASD manifestation across genders.\nForm the audience perspective, this research is designed for ML specialists, biologists, geneticists, and clinical practitioners interested in the intersection of technology and ASD diagnosis. For ML experts, the study provides a case study of how advanced models like CNNs can be applied to diagnostic challenges. Biologists and geneticists may find the focus on facial feature analysis and its potential links to ASD informative for their research on the biological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Clinicians and medical professionals will benefit from insights into how ML can support gender-sensitive diagnostic practices, particularly for underdiagnosed populations such as women."}, {"title": "1.5 Paper Organization", "content": "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature on ASD diagnosis and the use of ML in healthcare.

Section 5 discusses the results of our experiments, and Section 6 concludes the paper with final thoughts and suggestions for future research."}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND AND Related WORK", "content": "Recent research has focused on leveraging whole-genome sequencing (WGS) combined with ML to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) effectively. Studies highlight how WGS data, when integrated with ML techniques such as random forests and convolutional neural networks, can accurately predict resistance patterns without relying solely on known resistance genes, a significant advancement for understudied pathogens. For example, a study on Escherichia coli demonstrated that encoding techniques like label encoding and frequency-based encoding enabled ML models to identify AMR by capturing mutations related to resistance beyond established gene markers [6]. Another study found that WGS coupled with ML methods effectively predicted antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations, especially for pathogens like Salmonella, achieving substantial accuracy in clinical isolate tests [7]. Further systematic reviews affirm that combining WGS with ML can streamline and enhance AMR prediction for critical pathogens, providing an adaptable framework for various bacterial species [8].\nWhile whole-genome sequencing combined with ML has proven instrumental in identifying patterns of antimicrobial resistance, these techniques are promising in other areas of medical diagnostics, such as ASD. ML's capacity to detect subtle patterns offers a similar advantage in ASD diagnostics, particularly in identifying gender-specific symptom manifestations often overlooked in traditional assessments. Research on the diagnosis of ASD in women has increased in recent years, with growing attention to how symptoms manifest differently between males and females. In parallel, advancements in ML and face detection offer promising avenues for improving the accuracy of ASD diagnosis, particularly in underdiagnosed populations such as women. This section reviews vital studies addressing gender differences in ASD presentation and explores how ML techniques have been applied to ASD diagnosis.\nIncorporating advanced methodologies in ASD diagnosis is crucial for addressing the challenges posed by traditional approaches. Recent developments in ML for ASD diagnosis have explored innovative techniques. Albahri et al. [9] present a novel model leveraging a T-spherical fuzzy-weighted method, offering a significant step toward enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Complementing this, Rasul et al. [10] provide an evaluation of ML approaches for early ASD diagnosis. In contrast, Gao et al. [11] explore deep learning models in multi-modal imaging markers for interpretation. Rasul et al. [12] further reinforce the importance of early ML diagnosis, and Alqaysi et al. [13] introduce hybrid models utilizing a fuzzy sets-based decision-making model.\nMoreover, Bahathiq et al. [14] emphasize the efficacy of structural MRI in optimizing ML models. Parlett et al. [15] review unsupervised ML applications, highlighting their potential in ASD research, while Cao and Cao [16] reflect on the broader challenges and opportunities in this domain. Thapa et al. [17] differentiate autism sub-classifications using ML, and Washington and Wall [18] provide a roadmap for ASD-related data science research. Lastly, Alkahtani et al. [19] focus on facial landmark-based deep learning for ASD identification, and Alves et al. [20] explore functional brain networks combined with ML for improved diagnosis. These state-of-the-art approaches collectively advance the field of ASD diagnosis by leveraging ML's capability to detect nuanced patterns, providing a robust foundation for future research."}, {"title": "2.1 Gender Differences in Behavior and Symptoms", "content": "Several studies have investigated the differences in how ASD presents in males versus females. Lai et al. [21] proposed a four-level conceptual framework to explore the nosological and diagnostic challenges related to gender differences in ASD. This framework includes critical questions about how autism is defined, how gender influences the liability for developing ASD, and how developmental mechanisms differ between the sexes. Their work emphasizes the longstanding male bias in ASD research, which has led to a male-centered understanding of the disorder. While their framework provides a valuable tool for future studies, the complexity of the questions raised\u2014such as the role of gender in autism development\u2014has made it challenging to generate clear, unified findings.\nRatto et al. [22] expanded on these ideas by using an IQ-matched sample of school-aged youth to assess sex differences in ASD traits and adaptive skills. Their results revealed that females with higher IQs were less likely to meet the criteria on the ADI-R diagnostic tool despite exhibiting more severe traits based on parent reports. Additionally, females outperformed males in language and vocabulary skills, suggesting they may be more adept at masking their symptoms. This raises concerns that current diagnostic tools, designed with male traits in mind, may be insufficiently sensitive to the subtler manifestations of ASD in females. The study highlights the need for diagnostic tools that account for these gender-based differences to reduce the high rate of false negatives in females.\nBarbaro et al. [23] focused on early signs of ASD in infants and toddlers, investigating gender differences in communication behaviors between 18 and 24 months. While they found no significant differences in this age range, the large gender ratio discrepancy (44 females to 153 males) suggests that females may require more careful monitoring to ensure early detection of ASD symptoms. The small sample size for females limits the generalizability of the findings, and future studies should address this limitation by increasing the female sample size. Nonetheless, their study underscores the importance of early detection, particularly in female infants who may otherwise be overlooked."}, {"title": "2.2 Gender Biases in Diagnostic Tools", "content": "The work by Randall et al. [24] reviewed the effectiveness of several widely used ASD diagnostic tools, including ADOS, ADI-R, CARS, DISCO, GARS, and 3di, in diagnosing preschool children. Their findings showed that ADOS had the highest sensitivity, but all tools exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity, with none being fully reliable as a standalone assessment for ASD. The review also pointed out that these tools were developed with a male-biased understanding of ASD, potentially contributing to the underdiagnosis of females. The authors suggest that more gender-sensitive diagnostic criteria are needed, especially for preschool children, to ensure accurate and early diagnosis in both boys and girls.\nBrown et al. [25] proposed a modified version of the Girls Questionnaire for Autism Spectrum Condition (GQ-ASC) to address these biases. Their study, which included both cisgender and transgender women, identified five key components\u2014imagination and play, camouflaging, sensory sensitivities, socializing, and interests\u2014that were more relevant for diagnosing autism in women. By focusing on traits more common in females, the modified GQ-ASC achieved higher accuracy in distinguishing between autistic and non-autistic women. This work highlights the need for diagnostic tools that are sensitive to female-specific traits and demonstrates the importance of incorporating gender-related factors in ASD assessments."}, {"title": "2.3 ML and Face Detection in ASD Diagnosis", "content": "ML has proven to be a powerful tool in the medical domain, and recent research has applied it to the diagnosis of ASD, especially for analyzing complex behavioral and biological data. Studies using CNNs have shown that ML models can effectively analyze facial data to detect patterns associated with ASD. However, much of this research has focused on male-dominated datasets, limiting our understanding of how ASD manifests in females. Face detection, commonly used in computer vision tasks, has become a complementary tool in ASD diagnosis. By analyzing facial landmarks and structures, ML models can detect biological markers of ASD that may not be apparent in behavioral assessments. For example, studies have used CNNs to analyze facial features such as eye gaze, facial symmetry, and expression patterns, revealing significant differences between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls. Despite these advancements, few studies have examined how face detection can be applied to address the diagnostic challenges specific to females with ASD, leaving a significant research gap."}, {"title": "2.4 Usage of ML and Face Detection in Diagnosing ASD", "content": "Recent advances in ML and face detection have opened new possibilities for improving the diagnosis of ASD, mainly through analyzing facial morphology and applying computational models. This section reviews key studies that explore the relationship between facial features and ASD, as well as how ML techniques can enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly in underrepresented groups such as females."}, {"title": "2.5 Early Work on Facial Features and ASD Diagnosis", "content": "Early research on facial features in ASD primarily focused on males. Tan et al. [26] investigated whether boys and girls with ASD exhibit increased facial masculinity compared to typically developing controls. Using 3D photogrammetry, they analyzed facial features in a sample of 48 boys and 53 girls. Their study found that both boys and girls with ASD exhibited more androgynous facial features compared to neurotypical controls, suggesting a potential link between facial morphology and ASD traits. This study laid the foundation for subsequent research into how facial features might serve as diagnostic markers for ASD.\nBuilding on these findings, Tan et al. [27] used a larger sample of 209 children to investigate facial masculinity in ASD further. This study used 3D facial photogrammetry to assess facial features in children, including non-autistic siblings of children with ASD. Their results indicated that both male and female siblings of children with ASD displayed more masculine facial features than neurotypical controls, reinforcing the idea that facial traits may have a genetic link to ASD. However, this study was limited to a Caucasian population, highlighting the need for further research across different ethnic groups to improve the generalizability of these findings."}, {"title": "2.6 Gender Differences in Facial Morphology and ASD", "content": "While much of the early work focused on male participants, more recent studies have explored gender-specific facial traits in ASD. Gilani et al. [28] identified six key facial features that distinguished males from females and then examined these features in individuals with varying levels of ASD traits. Using 3D facial images of 208 young adults, the study found that individuals with high levels of ASD traits tended to exhibit less sexually dimorphic facial features. This research suggests that facial morphology might reflect autistic traits differently in males and females, providing a potential tool for improving gender-sensitive ASD diagnoses.\nTan et al. [29] continued this line of inquiry by analyzing facial masculinity and femininity in neurotypical adults with varying levels of autistic traits. Their findings showed that higher levels of autistic traits were associated with decreased femininity in females and less pronounced masculinity in males. Although this study offered valuable insights into the relationship between facial morphology and autistic traits, it was limited to neurotypical individuals and did not include those with clinical ASD diagnoses. This highlights a significant gap in the literature, as studies focused on facial features in women with diagnosed ASD remain underexplored. Additionally, these studies have yet to consider other important variables like age or ethnicity, which may influence the generalizability of findings across populations."}, {"title": "2.7 ML for ASD Diagnosis Using Facial Features", "content": "The application of ML to ASD diagnosis has demonstrated promising results in recent years. One notable study by Jahanara et al. [30] used CNNs to analyze facial features for ASD diagnosis. Their study applied transfer learning, using the VGG-19 architecture as the base model, and achieved an accuracy of 96%. However, their model also exhibited a high validation loss of nearly 50%, suggesting potential overfitting or issues with model generalization. While the accuracy results were impressive, the large gap between training and validation performance indicates that broader application requires further optimization.\nOur study builds on this work by comparing the performance of a baseline CNN with a more efficient CNN architecture, MobileNet, which is designed to handle high-dimensional data with fewer parameters. By incorporating both facial and behavioral data, we aim to improve overall accuracy and reduce validation loss, making the model more generalizable. Additionally, our research addresses a key limitation of previous work by including both male and female participants, thereby reducing the gender bias prevalent in earlier studies. Another approach to ASD diagnosis using ML was presented by Alca\u00f1iz et al. [31], who combined ML with virtual reality to classify children with ASD based on their movement patterns. Using a virtual reality system, they tracked children's body movements during various tasks and applied ML algorithms to classify ASD versus neurotypical children. While their study achieved an accuracy of 89%, it suffered from a limited sample size, particularly among female participants. This reinforces the need for more inclusive research that accurately represents gender diversity in ASD diagnosis."}, {"title": "2.8 Challenges and Opportunities in Using ML for ASD Diagnosis", "content": "Despite the progress in applying ML and facial feature analysis to ASD diagnosis, several challenges remain. Many studies reviewed were conducted on male-dominated datasets, limiting the models' ability to generalize to female populations. Furthermore, facial feature analysis alone may not be sufficient for comprehensive ASD diagnosis, as behavioral and cognitive traits also play a critical role. Combining facial and behavioral data in ML models offers an opportunity to develop more accurate and gender-sensitive diagnostic tools. Our study aims to address these gaps by integrating facial feature analysis with behavioral data and applying advanced CNN models to both male and female participants. By doing so, we hope to improve the accuracy of ASD diagnosis across genders and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how autistic traits are expressed in different populations."}, {"title": "2.9 Uniqueness of this Study", "content": "The existing body of work an ASD diagnosis has largely focused on male populations, overlooking gender-specific traits in females that contribute to underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis.

While some research has applied ML and facial feature analysis, these approaches typically lack a comprehensive representation of female subjects and fail to address gender biases in ASD diagnostic tools. This study uniquely bridges this gap by employing a hybrid approach, integrating both behavioral and facial data, emphasizing ML models tailored to identify gender-specific diagnostic patterns.

This baseline serves as a performance benchmark, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of more advanced architectures like MobileNet.

This results in a significant reduction in the number of parameters and computational complexity. For instance, a standard convolutional layer with 10 input channels, 20 output channels, and a 7x7 filter would require 2800 parameters. By separating the convolutional layer into depthwise and pointwise convolutions, MobileNet reduces the number of parameters to approximately 400, while still capturing essential spatial information.\n\u2022\tFactorization for efficiency: MobileNet's architecture factorizes standard convolutions into smaller, more efficient operations. This reduces the risk of overfitting and enables the model to run efficiently on devices with limited processing power, such as smartphones or low-end clinical diagnostic systems. This feature is particularly relevant for deploying ASD diagnostic tools in resource-constrained environments.\nWhy MobileNet? The choice of MobileNet is driven by its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency, both of which are critical for real-time applications in clinical settings. While deeper models like DenseNet could capture more intricate patterns in large datasets, MobileNet is better suited for our use case due to its:\n\u2022\tLow latency: MobileNet's lightweight architecture allows it to process images quickly, which is essential for real-time diagnostic applications.\n\u2022\tScalability and deployment: MobileNet is designed to work on various platforms, including low-power devices.

We ensured a comprehensive model performance analysis by focusing on key metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning were applied to optimize the models and prevent overfitting. The following section will discuss the results and analysis of both the baseline CNN and MobileNet models."}, {"title": "5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "The results of this study, as shown in Table 3, clearly indicate that Random Forest consistently outperformed all other models across various training-testing splits and datasets. It achieved 100% validation accuracy in all configurations (Tables 1, 2, and 3), underscoring its robustness in handling non-linear relationships and complex high-dimensional data. This exceptional performance highlights Random Forest's ability to generalize effectively, regardless of dataset size or complexity. Its ensemble learning approach aggregates multiple decision trees, allowing the model to capture intricate patterns in ASD-related data more effectively than simpler models. Random Forest is an ideal candidate for structured datasets in Autism research, where early and accurate diagnosis is crucial. The high precision and recall observed in Random Forest's performance minimize the chances of false positives and false negatives, which are critical factors in clinical settings, ensuring that both over-diagnosis and missed diagnoses are avoided.\nOn the other hand, Support Vector Machine ("}]}

These\nagents' capabilities and potentials have drawn sig-\nnificant research interest recently (Yao et al., 2023;\nLiu et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024;\nFang et al., 2024). However, to deploy the mod-\nels to real-life applications, the robustness against\ncostly or sometimes irreversible mistakes is crucial.\nFor instance, an incorrect purchase made by a web\nshopping agent can lead to a significant monetary\nloss, while a household agent mishandling kitchen\nequipment can pose serious safety risks.\nHowever, the existing research in LLM agents\nlacks a focus on robust modeling that proactively\nevaluates the decision process before executing any\ncritical actions. This leads to a gap in ensuring\nsafe and reliable operations. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce InferAct, an approach\ndesigned to evaluate whether an Actor agent is on\ntrack before any critical action is executed, and to\nsolicit human intervention if potential errors are\ndetected (c.f. Figure 1). This mechanism aims to\nenhance safety and prevent negative consequences\nresulting from risky executions. Current studies\n(Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024; Zhou et al.,\n2024a; Kim et al., 2023b) overlook potential risks\nincurred by executing critical actions and assume\nthe feedback indicating success or failure can be\nobtained post-action execution (e.g. 'buy-now' in\nautomatic online trading or web shopping).\nWe argue that this assumption is impractical in\nreal-world settings, particularly when failures carry\nsevere penalties (e.g., property damage, financial\nloss) or when obtaining human feedback is costly.\nUnlike the above studies, our proposed method,\nInferAct, does not rely on the post-execution feed-\nback. Instead, it leverages real-time assessment to\nmitigate risks before any detrimental outcome ma-\nterializes. By mimicking the vigilance of a human\noverseer, InferAct does not merely observe the\nactions taken by agents but infer the agent's intent\nbehind those actions. This ability to infer the in-\ntent is known as Theory of Mind (ToM) (Premack\nand Woodruff, 1978) in cognitive science, which\nenables humans to interpret the behavior of others\nby attributing mental states such as beliefs, and in-\ntentions to them. The most recent work (Strachan\net al., 2024) has shown that GPT-4 models per-\nformed at, or even sometimes above, human levels\nin several ToM aspects such as identifying indirect\nrequests, false beliefs. Building on the To\u041c \u0441\u0430-\npability of LLMs, InferAct interprets the intent\nbehind action chains executed by agents, identify-\ning deviations when these actions stray from their\nintended goals. If the intentions inferred from the\naction chains suggest a potential deviation or er-\nror, InferAct proactively alerts humans to provide\nfeedback. The feedback not only prevents unde-\nsirable outcomes from critical actions but offers\nguidance to refine the decision-making ability of\nthe Actor agent. Ultimately, this enhances the per-\nformance and trustworthiness of LLM agents.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of InferAct, we\nconduct experiments in three distinct environments,\nincluding a Web shopping task (Yao et al., 2022),\na household task (Shridhar et al., 2021), and\na search-based Question Answering task (Yang\net al., 2018). Our experiments demonstrate\nthat InferAct achieves the state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance across these tasks with various LLMs (e.g.\nGPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama-3-70B) as\nthe back-ends. By incorporating human feedback,\nInferAct significantly reduces the risks caused by\nerroneous actions and improves the performance of\nthe Actor agent compared with alternative methods.\nWe further evaluate different methods in high-\nstakes conditions including high-priced purchases\nin web shopping and high-risk operations in the\nhousehold task. The results reaffirm that InferAct\npossesses superior error detection capabilities in\nthese scenarios. When combined with the risk-\naware prompt, InferAct effectively minimizes the\nlosses (e.g. monetary loss) incurred by undetected\nadverse actions compared with alternative methods.\nTo summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a preemptive evaluation work-\nflow for LLM-based agents involved in criti-\ncal decision-making, which integrates human\nfeedback to enhance the safety and perfor-\nmance of agents.\n\u2022 We introduce InferAct, a novel approach that\napplies the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabil-\nities of LLMs to assist humans in preemp-\ntively detecting potential risks of LLM agents\nin critical scenarios. Our experiments show\nthat InferAct achieves state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance in detecting erroneous actions on three\ntasks with different LLMs as the back-ends.\n\u2022 InferAct has proven effective when com-\nbined with both binary and natural feedback,\nsignificantly enhancing the performance of\nLLM agents compared to alternative methods.\n\u2022 Our experiments in high-stakes setup show\nthe efficacy of InferAct. When equipped\nwith risk-aware prompts, the improvement of\nInferAct is evident not only in preventing the\nexecution of incorrect critical actions but also\nin minimizing losses incurred from undetected\nincorrect actions."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Trustworthiness of LLM Agents. As LLM\nagents gain the capability to interact with exter-\nnal environments to complete various tasks, it be-\ncomes crucial to address the potential irreversible\nconsequences of their actions and determine when\nhuman oversight is necessary. However, this area\nof research is still largely unexplored. The emu-\nlation method has been proposed to assess risks\nof API calls by utilizing LLMs as a sandbox en-\nvironment (Ruan et al., 2024; Hua et al., 2024).\nFor details about these works, please refer to Ap-\npendix C.

Current research\ngenerally assumes that feedback is either available\npost-execution (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024;\nZhou et al., 2024a; Kim et al., 2023b) or completely\nunavailable during task inference (Kim et al.,"}, {"title": "The Approach", "content": "This section describes the mechanism of InferAct\nto assess the reasoning process of the Actor, i.e.,\nthe agent to perform the user's task. Humans have\nthe strong ToM ability to infer other people's in-\ntentions based on their behaviors, without acessing\nto others' internal thoughts. Inspired by this, we\nleverage the ToM ability of LLMs to deduce the\nintended tasks behind the sequences of actions and\nobservations the Actor made during task execution.\nThe key idea is: by comparing the tasks inferred\nfrom the Actor's actions with the actual tasks given\nby the user, InferAct is able to detect whether the\nActor has deviated from the user's task during the\nexecution process. To fulfill this, we design two\ncomponents: the Task Inference Unit and the Task\nVerification Unit (c.f. Figure 3).\nThe Task Inference Unit. This unit is respon-\nsible for inferring intended tasks from the action\nchain performed by the Actor. The action chain,\ndenoted as S, comprises a sequence of (Action,\nObservation) pairs, {a1, 01, ..., am, 0m}. The Ac-\ntor operates under the ReAct (Yao et al., 2023)\nframework, which typically consists of the se-\nquence of Thought, Action, Observation). How-\never, for the purpose of unbiased task inference, the\nThought component is excluded to form S. The ra-\ntionale is that Thought records the internal deliber-\nations and plans of the Actor during task resolution,\nwhich might contain information about the user's\ntask. For instance, the first Thought of the Actor in\nFigure 2 explicitly states the task to 'find 66 inches\nblackout shades'. Excluding the Thought compo-\nnent ensures that task inference remains impartial\nand is not influenced by direct internal cues from\nthe Actor, which is crucial for verifying whether\nthe actions performed by the Actor align with the\nuser's specified task.\nSpecifically, we instruct LLMs with prompt $P_i$\n(c.f. Appendix A) to infer the N most probable\ntasks $T = \\{t_1, t_2, ..., t_N \\}$ that the action chain in-\ntends to solve.\n$T = LLM(P^I, S)$\nDue to the diversity and the varying granularity of\ntasks performed by the Actor, we opt for generating\nN most probable tasks rather than a single possi-\nble one. This mirrors the human ToM ability to\nconsider multiple plausible intentions or objectives\nfrom observed action chains. Once inferred tasks\nare obtained, along with the user's original task $t^*$,\nwe format them into a Multiple-Choice Question\n(MCQ) framework.\n$MCQ = \\{C_1, ..., C_N, C_{N+1}\\}$\nwhere $C_j = t_j$ for j = 1, 2, .., N and $C_{N+1} = t^*$.\nEach choice in the MCQ represents a task, and\nthe MCQ serves as the input for the Task Verifica-\ntion Unit, which evaluate the alignment between\nthe action chain S and the original task $t^*$.\nThe Task Verification Unit. Upon assembling\nthe MCQ set, the Task Verification Unit $P^U$\nprompts the LLM to assign a probability to each\nchoice $C_j$, indicating the likelihood that it is ful-\nfilled or on track to be fulfilled by the action chain\nS. The prompt $P^U$ is detailed in Appendix A.\n$P = \\{P_1, P_2, \u2026, P_N,P_{t^*}\\} = LLM(P^U, S, MCQ)$\nwhere $p_j = Pr(C_j \text{ is correct}|S)$ for each choice in\nthe MCQ.\nIn our experiments, we directly prompt LLMs\nto generate verbalized probability $p_j$ with justifica-\ntions derived from the token space of LLMs, which\nis friendly to commercial LLMs where logits of\ntokens might be unavailable. Given that LLMs\ncan be sensitive to the choice order (Robinson and\nWingate, 2023), we aggregate the probability of\n$p_{t^*}$ across different positions (refer to Appendix B).\nHow to enhance the reliability of verbalized prob-\nability has been extensively investigated (Mielke\net al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Ulmer\net al., 2024). Among them, we adopt the Top-k\nprompting strategy proposed by Tian et al. (2023)\nas it showed promising results in the following\nexperiments (Section 5). It should be noted that\nInferAct is flexible with different probability esti-\nmation methods.\nIn contrast to the typical MCQ where options\nare mutually exclusive and their prediction prob-\nabilities sum to 1.0, we consider the verification\nprocess as a multi-label task. This means that the\nsum of the assigned probabilities to each option\ndoes not need to be 1.0, reflecting the fact that one\naction chain S might fulfill multiple tasks. The\ninferred tasks from the Task Inference Unit can\nvary in granularity from the original task $t^*$, but\nare not mutually exclusive. For instance, an action\nchain S that fulfills the specific, fine-grained in-"}, {"title": "Experimental Setup", "content": "In this section, we evaluate InferAct on three dis-\ntinct tasks commonly used in LLM agents: Web-\nShop (Yao et al., 2022), HotPotQA (Yang et al.,\n2018) and ALFWorld (Shridhar et al., 2021). We\ndefine critical actions in these tasks.\nWebShop. The WebShop (Yao et al., 2022) is an\nonline shopping benchmark where an agent navi-\ngates an online store to fulfill user requests, such\nas purchasing a white vanity bench under $100.\nThe agent's actions include searching and clicking\nthrough the website, with the critical action being a\nclick[Buy Now] due to its financial implications.\nHotPotQA. As a Wikipedia-based question-\nanswering task, HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018) in\nthe agent setup (Yao et al., 2023) challenges agents\nto find correct answers using Wikipedia APIs.\nThe APIs include search[entity], lookup[string]\nand finish[answer]. The critical action is fin-\nish[answer] as it often affects the user's satisfaction\nwith the system, e.g., in the context of customer\nservice.\nALFWorld. In this household task (Shridhar\net al., 2021), agents perform a variety of actions\nto fulfill the user's task like Pick & Place, Clean\n& Place, Heat & Place, Cool & Place. The criti-\ncal actions include Clean, Heat, Cool since these\nactions involve potential irreversible physical state\nchanges to the objects being operated. For exam-\nple, if the agent cleans something that should not\nbe wet, it could damage the item. Besides, the task\ncompletion is also a critical action.\nThe detailed descriptions of these tasks and the\ncorresponding data size used for evaluation can be\nfound in Appendix E."}, {"title": "Evaluation Metrics", "content": "As we aim at identifying unsafe reasoning trajec-\ntory before executing critical actions, we measure\nhow well the model can identify it.

In our experiments, we compare the per-\nformance of four different aggregation methods\n{Min, Max, Mean, Product}.\nRegarding back-end LLMs, we use gpt-4-\n1106-preview (Achiam et al., 2023) as the Actor\nagent to perform the user's task.

A significant challenge in WebShop eval-\nuation lies in comprehending the subtle semantic\ndifference in similar items, product attributes such\nas distinguishing between a box spring foundation\nand a bed with a box spring, or, dark brown and\ncoffee brown hair dye. Baseline methods struggle\nwith these nuanced differences.\nUnlike baselines which directly contrast the\nActor's reasoning trajectory and the user's task,\nInferAct address the challenge by performing\nbackward inference. It infers a set of plausible\ninstructions that could have led to this action chain.\nFor instance, as depicted in Figure 2 (C), InferAct\ninfers three instructions related to custom cut-to-\nsize blackout shades based on the Actor's action\nchain. However, the user explicitly requests 66\u00d766\ninch blackout shades. Such discrepancies are over-\nlooked by other methods but are successfully iden-\ntified by InferAct by assigning a zero likelihood\nto the user's actual task, as shown in Figure 2 (D).\nHotPotQA is an information-seeking task. While\nthe multi-step evaluation method achieves competi-\ntive results, or even matches the performance using\nGPT-4-turbo, InferAct still delivers the best per-\nformance across the three back-end LLMs. The per-\nformance gains of InferAct are less pronounced\non HotPotQA compared to WebShop and ALF-\nWorld, primarily because the multi-step method\nbenefits from the LLMs' internal knowledge on\nthis particular task.

An agent\nneeds to purchase products that satisfy the user's\ninstructions (e.g. I am looking for a white vanity\nbench and priced lower than $100) by browsing\nthe e-commerce website. The actions the agent can\ntake include: (1) search[query], which performs\nsearch with a search bar (e.g. search[a white van-\nity bench]), and (2) click[button], which navigates\nthe website. The buttons include product title, op-\ntions (e.g. size/color), description, back to search,\nprev/next page, buy, and so forth. This task is eval-\nuated by the success rate that the Actor can find\nthe item needed by the user. The critical action\nin this dataset is click[Buy Now] as misoperation\ncan lead to money loss to users. Previous studies\nuse 100 (Shinn et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024) or 50\ntasks (Zhou et al., 2024a) as test data. Our evalua-\ntion expands this to use 300 tasks to ensure broader\nvalidation and reliability.\nHotPotQA. This is a wikipedia-based question\nanswering dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Notably,\nHotPotQA is widely used in various setups such as\ninformation retrieval or LLM agents. In our paper,\nwe follow the agent setup in ReAct (Yao et al.,\n2023) where the agent can only access Wikipedia\nAPIs with three actions to find the answer to a given\nquestion. The tools include: (1) search[entity],\nwhich returns the first five sentences from the wiki\npage for the searched entity if it exists or suggests\nsimilar entities, (2) lookup[string], which returns\nthe next sentence in the page containing the string,\n(3) finish [answer], which returns the answer found\nby the agent. The critical action is finish[answer]\nas it often affects the user's satisfaction with the\nsystem, e.g., in the context of customer service.\nThe evaluation metric used in the HotPotQA is the\nexact match between the predicted answer and the\ngolden answer. Previous work (Shinn et al., 2023;\nYao et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024a) uses 100 tasks\nin evaluation, we extend the number to 300 tasks.\nALFWorld. This is a household task (Shridhar\net al., 2021) where an agent needs to complete\na user's task (e.g., clean the soapbar and put it\ninto the cabinet.) by exploring environments. It\nincludes six different types of tasks, including Pick\n& Place, Examine in Light, Clean & Place, Heat\n& Place, Cool & Place, Pick Two & Place. The\ncritical actions include Clean, Heat, Cool since\nthese actions involve potential irreversible physical\nstate changes to the objects being operated. For\nexample, if the agent cleans something that should\nnot be wet, it could damage the item. Besides, the\ntask completion is also a critical action. Following\nprevious work (Yao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023;\nYao et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024a), we conduct\nevaluations across all 134 unseen validation tasks."}]}

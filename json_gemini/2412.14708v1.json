In this section, we present sensor technologies that are suitable for\ncreating smart spaces."}, {"title": "3.1 Environmental sensors", "content": "Environmental sensors are essential technologies used indoors to monitor and understand various conditions and aspects\nof the environment. Below are examples of sensors commonly utilized in indoor settings.\nAir quality sensors: These sensors are vital technologies that monitor and provide essential data on various air pollutants.\nExamples of these pollutants include Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone\n(O3), Formaldehyde (HCHO), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), and particulate matter like PM2.5 [36-39]. In\nsmart spaces, these sensors enable real-time air quality monitoring, ensuring a clean, healthy, and comfortable indoor\natmosphere. They can also trigger early warnings when air quality deviates from safe levels. The data gathered by these\nsensors can be used to intelligently control ventilation systems, adjusting airflow rates when pollution levels exceed\nsafety thresholds [40].\nTemperature and humidity sensors: Temperature sensors play a crucial role in maintaining optimal thermal conditions.\nIn indoor environments, they are used to assess thermal comfort and provide insights into personalized comfort\nexperiences [41], [42], [43], [44]. By integrating temperature sensors with physiological data, occupant-responsive\nmodels [45] can be developed to capture personalized thermal preferences and predict individual comfort levels more\neffectively. These temperature measurements enable HVAC systems to precisely adjust heating and cooling, ensuring\noccupant comfort while enhancing thermal satisfaction, e.g., through the integration of temperature and humidity\nsensing with digital twins to offer personalized thermal comforts [46]. Furthermore, automating HVAC systems based\non real-time data from temperature sensors reduces excessive energy consumption, optimizing energy use within the\nspace. Alongside temperature sensing, humidity sensors are also important sensing technology that enables maintaining\nproper indoor conditions by regulating relative humidity. These sensors help prevent mold growth, material damage,\nand discomfort caused by excess moisture or dryness, thereby creating a healthier and more comfortable indoor\nenvironment [37]. Consequently, the use of temperature and humidity sensors is essential in smart spaces to enhance\npersonalized occupant experiences, improve well-being, and improve energy efficiency.\nLight and noise sensors: The use of ambient light sensors (also known as photometric sensors) and noise sensors\nis crucial in indoor environments, as they help monitor and regulate light and noise levels, ensuring both visual and\nauditory comfort [47, 48]. Indoor illumination is closely tied to the activities of the occupants [49]. By sensing indoor\nlight conditions, lighting systems can intelligently adjust and dim light levels to meet the visual comfort needs of\nindividuals, optimizing energy use while maintaining comfort [50,51]. Similarly, noise sensors are vital for detecting\nsound levels, which can be used to monitor occupancy or identify specific events occurring within indoor spaces [52].\nThese technologies contribute to creating responsive and adaptive environments that enhance the overall well-being of\noccupants."}, {"title": "3.2 Infrared sensors", "content": "Infrared sensors are among the most commonly used sensors in buildings, employed to detect the presence of people\nand monitor space occupancy, identify occupant activities and space utilization, and support energy management\nsystems [20].\nPassive infrared (PIR) sensor: This sensing technology, commonly known as a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor, is\nwidely used indoors to detect motion by passively sensing infrared (heat) radiation emitted by objects within its field\nof view [39]. PIR sensors operate in three modes: idle mode, where no motion is detected (i.e., no infrared radiation)\nand the sensor remains inactive; detection mode, which occurs when motion is detected; and triggering mode, when\nthe sensor activates an event, such as triggering an alarm system to detect unauthorized entry. In smart environments,\nPIR sensors provide valuable data that can be used to enhance various comfort, health, and safety applications [53].\nFor instance, they enable motion-activated lighting, where sensors automatically turn lights on or off, and automated\nappliance control, where sensors manage electrical systems such as fans, smart curtains, heaters, or HVAC systems. By\nadjusting or turning off electrical systems when no motion is detected, these PIR-enabled applications contribute to\nsignificant energy savings [54].\nUltralow-resolution infrared (IR) sensors: This sensor technology is a type of thermal sensor that captures infrared\n(IR) radiation at a very low resolution. These IR sensors detect radiation emitted by objects and generate information\nusing a limited number of pixels, restricting their ability to provide high accuracy or detailed outputs, such as precise\ntemperature mapping [55]. However, these limitations make IR sensors cost-effective, energy-efficient, and privacy-\npreserving, making them well-suited for use in various smart environment applications. These applications typically\ninvolve basic infrared detection tasks, such as motion and presence detection, occupancy monitoring, proximity sensing,\nand simple gesture recognition [56-58]."}, {"title": "3.3 Cameras", "content": "Cameras are among commonly used technologies in smart spaces. They offer a rich source of information from both\nusers and systems, enabling the development of various applications such as security, access control, and activity\nrecognition.\nSurveillance cameras: These technologies also known as video surveillance systems, have become ubiquitous and\nwidely accessible. Depending on the specific application and the desired image quality, commercially available cameras\nvary in frame rates, resolutions, and fields of view [59]. In smart environments, these cameras can be integrated\nwith other sensor technologies and actuators, facilitating advanced applications such as facial recognition, gesture\ndetection, augmented reality, and occupancy monitoring [60]. However, despite their capabilities, surveillance cameras\npose significant challenges related to privacy [61], as well as data storage and processing [62]. Therefore, careful\nconsideration is required when designing and deploying these systems in smart environments to mitigate potential risks.\nThermal cameras: These technologies utilize a passive sensing approach, capturing infrared radiation (heat) emitted\nby objects [63]. While thermal cameras typically have lower resolution compared to surveillance cameras, they are\nwell-suited for various privacy-preserving applications, such as people detection, counting, and tracking [64]. In smart\nenvironments, thermal cameras can be employed to monitor energy consumption of systems such as TVs, computers,\nlighting, and HVAC systems, helping optimize their operation. Additionally, these technologies can be used indoors to\nmonitor occupancy in a privacy-conscious manner [65]."}, {"title": "3.4 Other sensing technologies", "content": "A wide variety of sensor technologies are available today, each tailored to measure specific variables and serve numerous\napplications [66]. In this subsection, we present a few common sensor technologies that can be used to create smart\nspaces.\nSmart meters: These devices are designed to measure, record, and monitor the consumption of resources such as\nelectricity, gas, and water. In buildings, smart meters can be used to detect leaks or abnormal resource usage [67, 68].\nTherefore, in smart environments, they can play an important role in collecting consumption data, enabling a better\nunderstanding of space utilization. This data can be used to identify the energy consumed by specific systems (e.g.,\nlighting, TVs, HVAC), and to develop models and forecasting methods for scheduling and optimizing resource\nutilization [69].\nGeophone sensors: These highly sensitive devices can detect ground vibrations with high precision, making them\nwidely used in seismic monitoring. Their accuracy and reliability also make them valuable for applications such as\nmonitoring structural vibrations and movements in buildings [70]. In smart environments, geophone sensors can be\nutilized for several purposes: (i) detecting occupancy to improve energy management, security, and space optimization,\n(ii) tracking occupant positions, providing insights into movement patterns, (iii) identifying footsteps and estimating\ndirection, and enabling personalized tracking and behavior analysis, and (iv) analyzing space utilization to enhance\ninterior design by adjusting layouts or seating arrangements.\nWireless sensing: This sensing technique leverages the channel state information of wireless signals from commu-\nnication technologies such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) or cellular systems. By analyzing fluctuations in the radio waves\ntransmitted between devices, this technique enables detecting the activities and events. Wireless sensing enables estima-\ntion of persons' presence, activity, location, motion, and their gestures [71-73]. In smart environments, common devices\nsuch as wireless access points, TVs, mobile phones, laptops, and other smart devices-equipped with technologies like\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks\u2014can facilitate the implementation of wireless sensing. Smart environments can\nharness wireless sensing for a wide range of applications, including security, health and wellness monitoring, emergency\nresponse, and intelligent interactions [74,75].\nUltrasonic sensing: This technology employs inaudible sound waves, typically around 20 kHz, to detect and interpret\ninteractions within an environment. By emitting acoustic signals through built-in speakers and capturing the reflected\nwaves via microphones, this technique leverages the Doppler effect to analyze changes in frequency caused by moving\nobjects. For instance, the research in [76] presents EchoSensor, a sensing system that utilizes ultrasonic sensors\nfor intrusion detection in smart homes. EchoSensor system employs existing audio devices to transmit and capture\nultrasonic signals, processing the reflections to identify patterns of human gait cycles. In addition, this research\naddresses that ML methodologies and signal processing allow to differentiate between authorized individuals and\npotential intruders, pinpointing the potentials of ultrasonic sensing for enhancing smart home security.\nActuators: These technologies are designed to convert energy-whether electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic-into\nmechanical motion. Actuators function as devices or processes that translate control signals into physical movement.\nThey are employed in a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to consumer electronics, enabling\nthe operation of various systems [77]. In smart environments, actuators play a crucial role in optimizing energy\nefficiency. For instance, they control the operation of HVAC and lighting systems, regulating airflow or adjusting\nlighting levels based on environmental conditions. They can also be integrated with smart curtains to modulate light\nexposure, contributing to energy conservation and enhanced user comfort.\nSmartphones and wearables: Equipped with advanced sensor technologies, smartphones and wearables generate\nvaluable data that can seamlessly integrates into smart spaces. Smartphones, for instance, provide GPS, accelerometer,\nand Bluetooth data, enabling precise tracking, indoor positioning, and an understanding of the services users require\nwithin the space [78]. An example of their application is proximity-based contact tracing, where smartphones use\nBluetooth and wireless systems to detect interactions between users. Utilizing these built-in sensors, smartphones\ncan be used for public health measures such as disease tracking in indoor environments [79]. Wearables, with their\nphysiological and biomedical sensors, allow continuous monitoring of users' health, safety, and activities, such as\ntracking health metrics within smart spaces [80]. Furthermore, these devices can support privacy-aware solutions,\nensuring that smart spaces respect user confidentiality while leveraging their capabilities [81]."}, {"title": "3.5 Challenges and limitations", "content": "Commercially available sensor technologies are affordable and provide a wide range of environmental data from the\nlocations where they are deployed. Their low cost and availability make it feasible to deploy them in large numbers,\nenabling the creation of smart environments. However, despite these advantages, they come with the following\nlimitations:\nSensing capabilities: Low-cost sensors typically have a limited number of sensor units. Some sensors are designed to\nmeasure a specific variable, such as temperature, while others can measure multiple variables on a single sensor board,\nsuch as temperature, relative humidity, and CO2. In reality, there are many variables that can be measured to fully\nunderstand the state of an indoor environment, but not all sensors are equipped to capture all of these variables. For\nexample, some sensors can measure temperature, relative humidity, and CO2, while others measure variables such as\ntemperature, noise, light, and PM2.5. To overcome this limitation, virtual sensors powered by AI and machine learning\ncan be developed. These virtual sensors estimate unmeasured variables by using available data as a proxy [82]. For\ninstance, PM2.5 and temperature measurements can be used to estimate CO2 and black carbon concentrations, providing\na more comprehensive understanding of indoor environmental conditions [83].\nCommunication capabilities: Low-cost sensors, when not using cables for communication, typically employ at least\none type of wireless communication technology. Each technology has its own set of characteristics, such as connectivity\nrobustness, bandwidth, coverage, and energy consumption. For instance, while one low-cost sensor might offer\nBluetooth connectivity, another might provide both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi options. Bluetooth is known to have robustness\nconnectivity concerns [84], while Wi-Fi might be more demanding in terms of energy consumption [85], which is\na crucial consideration for battery-powered sensors. Therefore, when planning the connectivity and communication\nstrategy for sensors, it is necessary to consider the availability and features of each communication technology.\nSensing accuracy: Low-cost sensors often experience reduced sensing accuracy over time. Although these sensors are\ninitially calibrated in a controlled laboratory environment, their measurement precision tends to degrade, leading to\nmeasurement drifts. However, in the smart environments, AI and machine learning-based calibration techniques can be\nemployed to re-calibrate these sensors more frequently [86], helping to ensure accurate sensing over time.\nEnergy consumption: Most low-cost sensors are battery-powered and have limited energy resources. To create smart\nenvironments and improve the management of sensors deployed in these settings, it is essential to plan an effective\ndata transmission strategy. While some sensors generate small amounts of data that require less power to transmit,\nthe frequency of data transmission can be adjusted based on the importance of the measured variables. This helps to\nextend the battery life. For sensor devices that capture images and require more bandwidth and transmission power,\nmechanisms can be implemented to selectively transmit a limited number of images, ensuring the extension of battery\nlife [87].\nSecurity and privacy: In smart environments, the use of cameras and other sensor devices that can potentially reveal\nindividuals' identities is often known as privacy-intrusive, raising significant security and privacy concerns. To address\nthese issues and protect individuals' privacy, a range of privacy-preserving techniques can be employed, including\nencryption, anonymization, access control, and differential privacy [88]."}, {"title": "4 Data Communications", "content": "In this section, we present the most common wireless communication technologies and protocols that can be used to\nestablish smart spaces."}, {"title": "4.1 Communication technologies", "content": "The diverse range of technologies used to establish smart spaces such as sensors, actuators, smart phones, smart\nwearables, and smart TVs\u2014each have unique communication requirements that vary based on factors like deployment\nlocation, lifespan constraints, and data traffic patterns. Therefore, selecting the right communication technology for a\nsmart space is a critical design decision, as it can greatly influence the performance, power consumption, and overall\nfunctionality of the connected devices, ultimately affecting the efficiency of the smart environment. This section\nprovides an overview of the wireless technologies suitable for smart spaces.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short-range wireless communication technology specifically designed for Internet\nof Things (IoT) applications, serving as an extension of classic Bluetooth.

LoRaWAN operates on a star-of-stars topology\nand does not facilitate device-to-device communication. The technology employs an adaptive data rate technique,\noptimizing transmission parameters to enhance both energy efficiency and network longevity [93]. With minimal energy\nconsumption, LoRaWAN can maintain reliable connectivity over long distances while providing high accuracy. This\ncapability enables effective remote monitoring and control of IoT devices. These features, combined with its low-power\nrequirements, make LoRaWAN exceptionally suitable for smart space applications [94].\nLow Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is a low-power, short-range communication technology\nspecifically designed for transmitting IPv6 packets.

This technology allows devices in close proximity to\ncommunicate directly without the need for routers or access points. With a battery life of up to 20 years, ZigBee devices\ntypically have a communication range of 10 to 100 meters, depending on environmental factors and device configurations.\nDue to its energy efficiency and flexible network scalability, ZigBee is widely used in smart environments, particularly\nin home automation systems, such as smart sensors, lighting, door locks, and home controllers [98].\nZ-Wave is a wireless technology designed for low-power, low-data-rate applications, with a range of up to 100 meters in\nopen air and up to 20 meters indoors. It supports multiple data rates, including 100 kbps for maximum throughput, and\n9.6 kbps or 40 kbps for more energy-efficient communication. Z-Wave allows bidirectional communication, facilitating\na robust mesh network topology. In theory, a Z-Wave network can accommodate up to 232 devices, though for optimal\nperformance and reliability, a practical limit of around 50 connections is recommended [99]. Due to its reliability and\nease of integration, Z-Wave is widely adopted in smart home automation and security systems [100].\nThread is a versatile wireless technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, enabling IPv6-based wireless mesh\nnetworking.

For example,\nISO/IEC 18000-6B allows simultaneous reading of up to 10 tags with a large data storage capacity, while ISO/IEC\n18000-6C enables the reading of hundreds of tags at once, although with lower individual data storage per tag. RFID\nis a cost-effective solution, offering a typical range from a few centimeters to several meters. This makes it ideal for\nefficient tracking systems, especially in indoor positioning and localization scenarios. RFID-based indoor localization\nis particularly useful in smart environments for monitoring daily activities and tracking objects or visitors [103].\nNear Field Communication (NFC) is a subset of RFID technology, primarily used for close-range applications. It\nenables communication within a range of up to 2 centimeters and supports data transfer rates from 46 kbps to 1.7\nMbps [104]. NFC can enhance indoor navigation systems by allowing users to update their location by simply tapping\nNFC tags placed throughout an environment, effectively addressing the limitations of GPS in indoor settings [105].\nThe short operational range of NFC, combined with its ease of use and security features, makes it an ideal choice for\nsecure identification systems. For instance, it can be used for access control in smart environments, enabling users to\nauthenticate themselves when entering restricted areas.\nExtended Coverage \u2013 GSM \u2013 Internet of Things (EC-GSM-IoT) is a cellular wireless technology developed\nspecifically to support IoT applications that require low data rates and extended coverage.

With data rates reaching up to 384 kbps, LTE-M is well-suited for applications requiring higher data throughput\nand low latency [106]. A key benefit of LTE-M is its support for mobility, voice, and SMS, which makes it highly\nadaptable across various smart home applications. In smart environments, LTE-M can power numerous systems such as\nhome security, closed-circuit television (CCTV), and fire alarm networks, where reliable connectivity and real-time\nresponsiveness are essential [108].\nNarrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a low-power cellular IoT standard designed to provide a 20 dB gain over\nGPRS, making it particularly effective for indoor applications.

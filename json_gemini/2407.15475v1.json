INTRODUCTION", "content": "Swarm robotics offers a method for coordinating a large number of robots, inspired by swarm behaviours\nin nature [1]. The collective behaviours of a swarm are not directly engineered into the system. Rather,\nthey arise due to interactions among individual robots and their environment, called emergent behaviour [2].\nModelling and characterizing emergent behaviour can pose significant challenges [3], presenting an obstacle\nto ensuring assurance of swarms. Assurance tasks encompass adhering to standards, obtaining certification,\nand conducting verification and validation (V&V).\nVerification involves ascertaining that an artifact complies with its specified requirements, while validation\ninvolves ascertaining that an artifact will effectively perform its intended functions in the real world [4].\nAutonomous robotic systems are inherently complex, thus a range of distinct verification methods, known as\nheterogeneous verification (e.g., testing, simulation, and formal verification), is required to foster confidence\nin these systems. Formal verification encompasses various mathematical techniques (e.g., theorem proving,\nmodel checking) used to prove properties concerning a formal representation of a system [4]. Model\nchecking is employed for verifying that a formal model satisfies temporal logic properties by exhaustively\nexploring the entire state space. The outcome of this process usually manifests as a Boolean value,\nsignifying whether the model fulfills a specified property [4]. When the model fails to satisfy a property, a\ncounterexample (error trace) is generated, describing the sequence of states that resulted in the violation\nof the property. Probabilistic model checking additionally allows the calculation of probabilities that the\nspecified properties will be fulfilled.\nValidation is a process which, in common with heterogeneous verification, uses a range of techniques\n(e.g., design reviews, integration testing, and user trials) to establish whether a system is fit for purpose in\nits intended real-world environment. In this work, validation is performed on our swarm robot platform,\nDOTS (Distributed Organisation and Transport System) [5], via a system integration test using physical\nhardware in a swarm arena environment representing the intended real-world operational design domain.\nMost existing approaches to swarm system modelling focus on simulations, which can be low-fidelity\n(LF) or high-fidelity (HF). There are several macroscopic formal approaches that aim to analyze overall\nswarm behaviour [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, only a few approaches provide a unified, multi-level\nrepresentation of swarms ([11], [12], [13], [14]). Nevertheless, none of these utilize data obtained from\nactual simulations to characterize the formal models, nor do they investigate the emergent properties that\narise from the inherent qualities of swarms. The main contributions of this paper are:\n\u2022 Multi-level Swarm Modelling: We propose a holistic swarm system modelling approach that spans\nmacroscopic formal modelling, LF simulations, HF simulations, and real-robot levels (see Fig. 1).\n\u2022 Incorporation of Simulation Data in Formal Models: Unlike existing approaches, our formal\nmacroscopic models for verification are characterized using data derived from both LF and HF\nsimulations, ensuring accuracy and traceability across different system models.\n\u2022 Corroborative Approach to V&V: We integrate formal verification with experiments involving real\nrobots, aiming to instill greater confidence in the evidence compared to using these techniques in\nisolation.\n\u2022 Case Study on a Public Cloakroom: We apply our approach to a case study involving a swarm of\nrobots operating within a public cloakroom, demonstrating its effectiveness in a practical scenario.\nThe paper's structure is as follows. Section II provides background information on this work, key\nrelated works, and a brief description of the case study. In Section III we present our macroscopic formal\nmodel. Section IV describes the simulations and the data used to characterize our formal models, while\nSection V discusses our formal verification approach. In Section VI, we validate our work using real-world\nexperiments. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "The requirements used in this paper are based on the overall specifications derived in [2], which\nproposes a process called AEROS for safety assurance of emergent behaviour in autonomous robotic\nswarms. AEROS consists of six stages within the emergent behavior lifecycle [2]. It is derived from the\nAMLAS process [15], which is centered on the assurance of machine learning in autonomous systems."}, {"title": "B. Swarm System Modelling", "content": "Swarm robotic system modelling can occur at four levels of abstraction: macroscopic formal modelling,\nLF simulations, HF simulations, and real robots [11], [16]. The macroscopic level provides a high-level\nrepresentation of swarm dynamics, particularly beneficial for large-sized swarms. Most existing approaches\nto swarm system modelling focus on simulations. In LF simulators, details of the environment and\nreal-world physics are abstracted and simplified whilst retaining the most relevant features of the robots in\nthe system [17], [18]. In contrast, HF simulators strive to replicate the real-world as closely as possible in\norder to obtain realistic results to the degree of precision and accuracy required [5].\nThe existing literature in macroscopic modelling can be categorized into three groups: those using rate or\ndifferential equations, employing classical control and stability theory for swarm properties, and utilizing\nother approaches [14]. In [6], the authors propose a five-step approach based on differential equations\nto develop a macroscopic probabilistic model for swarm robotic systems. Subsequently, [7] extend the\nwork in [6] by using it for verifying the global swarm behaviour with the PRISM model checker [19].\nMeanwhile, the authors in [8] discuss a robot controller designed for a simplified foraging scenario and\npresent a set of differential equations to illustrate the dynamics of their collective behaviour. In other\napproaches, Dixon et al. [10] and Winfield et al. [9] employ linear-time temporal logic to specify properties\npertaining to both individual robots and the entire swarm. A similar methodology is explored by Konur et\nal. [7] and Brambilla et al. [14], wherein they analyze swarm robotic systems using probabilistic model\nchecking. The authors in [10] only consider a very small swarm consisting of two or three robots.\nHowever, only a few approaches offer a unified, multi-level representation of swarms ([11], [12], [13],\n[14]). These follow either a bottom-up or top-down method but do not elaborate on specific V&V processes.\nAdditionally, they do not utilize data from actual simulations to characterize formal models to ensure\naccuracy and traceability across different system models, nor do they investigate emergent properties\narising from the inherent qualities of swarms."}, {"title": "C. Case Study: The Cloakroom", "content": "Our case study involves a robotic swarm managing a public cloakroom at events attended by 50 to 10,000\npeople [20], [2]. In this cloakroom, a group of robots assists event attendees in depositing, storing, and\nretrieving their personal items, such as jackets [20]. Given the swarm's operation in a public environment,\nthe system places a high priority on ensuring public safety, which includes measures that prevent harm\nfrom collisions and mitigate fire hazards caused by obstructions.\nThe scenario presented here is a version of the cloakroom operating in a small window of time (a few\nminutes), focused at the retrieval of items towards a deposit zone. This scenario was chosen as an example\nof a logistics task and could be adapted to other scenarios. In this scenario, the robots in the swarm\ninitially search for \u201ccarriers\u201d, which are platforms used for transporting objects in the cloakroom [20].\nRobots must position themselves below a carrier to lift it up. When a robot finds a carrier, it picks it up\nand transports it to the designated delivery area, employing a random walk while also making efforts to\navoid obstacles such as other robots or walls [20]. The cloakroom (see Fig. 2) contains three zones with\nthe following usage:\n\u2022 Red zone: To prevent blocking the fire exit, robots must not enter this zone. The dimensions of this\nzone have been chosen to adequately cover the realistic width of a human doorway (90-100 cm). The\nred zone is located in the bottom left corner of the cloakroom, with a width of 85 cm and a height of\n185 cm.\n\u2022 Amber zone: This zone is a buffer for the red zone; robots should avoid it or spend minimal time in\nthis zone. The dimensions of this zone have been chosen to allow for a maximum of two robots in this"}, {"title": "III. MACROSCOPIC FORMAL MODEL", "content": "In this section, we describe our macroscopic model for the overall swarm, adapted from [7], [6] for\nthe cloakroom case study. At the macroscopic level, the swarm is viewed as a unified entity, offering a\nhigh-level representation of swarm dynamics that enhances adaptability, especially in large-sized swarms.\nIn our approach, we construct a probabilistic finite state machine (PFSM) for the swarm, which contains\nthe exact same states as those found in an individual robot. Additionally, we include a counter to track the\nnumber of robots in each state. Furthermore, we develop a set of \u2018differential equations' for each state\nwithin the PFSM of the cloakroom.

Robot movement is\nstochastic and a new heading is selected at random every 0.4 seconds (s). Robots also perform obstacle\navoidance upon detection of an object in range of their infra-red laser sensors, and they have an additional\n5 cm avoidance margin to prevent physical collisions.

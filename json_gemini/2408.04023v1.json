Introduction", "content": "LLM based Natural language processing (NLP) models have achieved significant advancements in recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications, including language translation, text summarization, dialogue systems, and content recommendation. However, the widespread adoption of these models has heightened concerns regarding their propensity to generate harmful or biased outputs, especially when deployed in sensitive contexts or high-stakes business domains. Contextual grounding, defined as the process of anchoring a model's understanding and decision-making within relevant situational, cultural, and ethical contexts, has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. By explicitly incorporating contextual information, it is possible to better align a model's behavior with human expectations, societal norms, and ethical principles, thereby mitigating the risks of unintended or harmful consequences.\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for contextual grounding in textual models, aimed at enhancing their robustness, trustworthiness, and safety.

Related Work", "content": "Contextual grounding has been explored in various domains within natural language processing (NLP), including sentiment analysis, dialog systems, and ethical language generation. Researchers have investigated how contextual factors like domain knowledge [1], cultural nuances [2], and situational contexts [3] impact the accuracy and fairness of models. Yushi Yao, Guangjian Li [4] proposed a context-aware sentiment analysis model that enhances sentiment word identification by incorporating contextual information. For dialog systems, studies have shown that incorporating contextual information such as conversational history, user profiles, and situational awareness can significantly improve the quality and naturalness of generated responses [5]. Zhaojiang et al. [6] introduced a context-aware neural conversation model that considers multi-turn dialog history and personal traits of the participants. In ethical language generation, the importance of contextual grounding has been recognized to ensure Al systems generate language aligning with societal norms, cultural values, and ethical principles [7].\nResearchers at the Allen Institute for AI [8] proposed a framework for ethical language generation that incorporates social, cultural context, and ethical reasoning principles to avoid generating harmful or biased content. Additionally, studies emphasize the need to consider ethical and societal implications when developing and deploying Al systems [9, 10]. For instance, the AI Now Institute [10] highlights the importance of considering the broader societal impact, ethical implications, and potential risks associated with Al systems, particularly in sensitive domains or high-stakes applications. However, a comprehensive framework for contextual grounding in textual models, specifically focused on enhancing their robustness, trustworthiness, and safety, remains an area requiring further exploration and development. While previous works have addressed contextual grounding in specific domains or tasks, a unified approach integrating techniques from knowledge representation, adversarial training, interpretable AI, and continuous monitoring is lacking. Existing methods often focus on individual aspects of contextual grounding, such as incorporating domain knowledge or mitigating specific biases.\nA holistic framework considering the interplay between situational, cultural, and ethical contexts, and their impact on model behavior across various tasks and applications, is needed to ensure the overall robustness, trustworthiness, and safety of textual models. By addressing this gap, the proposed framework in this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and principled approach to contextual grounding, enabling the development of more reliable, ethical, and trustworthy NLP systems that can be deployed in a wide range of real-world scenarios while aligning with human values and societal expectations."}, {"title": "3. Proposed framework", "content": "The proposed framework as displayed in Figure 1 below, comprises of five key components that work together to enable contextual grounding in textual models. Firstly, the Context Representation component captures and represents relevant contextual information, such as situational factors, cultural norms, and ethical considerations, in a machine-readable format using techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning. The Context-Aware Encoding component then integrates this contextual information with the textual inputs, ensuring that the model's understanding and decision-making are influenced by the relevant context. The Context-Aware Learning component incorporates contextual grounding into the model's training process, enabling it to learn context-sensitive representations and decision boundaries through techniques like multitask learning, adversarial training, and curriculum learning. To enhance transparency and scrutiny of the model's decision-making processes, the Interpretability and Explainability component leverages techniques from interpretable AI, such as attention visualization and counterfactual explanations. Finally, the Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation component implements mechanisms for continuous monitoring and adaptation of the model's behavior based on feedback and evolving contextual factors, using techniques from online learning and continual learning."}, {"title": "3.1. Situational Context", "content": "We developed ontologies to represent situational factors, such as location, time, activity, and environmental conditions.

This relationship implies that every situation is a specific instance or type of context, but not all contexts are necessarily situations. This distinction is important for differentiating between general contextual information and more specific situational data. The core of the ontology lies in its definition of a Situation (3). This formal description states that a Situation is equivalent to the conjunction of three existential relationships: it has a Location, it has a Time, and it has an Activity. Each of these components must exist for something to be classified as a Situation in this ontology. This definition provides a clear structure for what constitutes a situation, enabling more precise reasoning about contextual factors.

The core definition of Culture (8) is composed of four key elements: Region, EthnicGroup, Religion, and Value. This definition suggests that a culture is characterized by its geographical location, the ethnic groups it encompasses, its religious influences, and its core values. The ontology further refines these components by establishing hierarchical relationships. Region is defined as a subset of SpatialThing (9), linking cultural geography to broader spatial concepts. EthnicGroup is categorized as a subset of SocialGroup (10), placing ethnic identities within the larger framework of social structures. Religion is classified as a subset of BeliefSystem (11), contextualizing religious practices within broader ideological frameworks.

Data Collection", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework for contextual grounding in textual models, we conducted experiments on a real-world dataset focused on bias detection and mitigation. The Social Bias Inference Corpus (SBIC) [11] dataset was chosen for this purpose, as it contains a diverse collection of sentence pairs annotated for the presence of biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender, race, religion, and age. By utilizing this dataset, we aimed to assess the framework's ability to incorporate contextual information about sensitive attributes and mitigate biases, thereby aligning the model's behavior with societal norms and ethical principles. The experimental setup involved training and evaluating our context-grounded models, as well as several baseline models, on the SBIC dataset. Appropriate evaluation metrics were carefully selected to measure not only the accuracy of bias detection and classification but also the fairness and interpretability of the models' predictions across different sensitive attribute groups. The details of the dataset, evaluation metrics, and baseline models used in our experiments are provided in the following sections. The SBIC dataset consists of over 150,000 sentence pairs, where each pair contains a sentence and a corresponding hypothesis statement. The sentences and hypotheses are annotated for the presence of biases related to various sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, religion, and age."}, {"title": "3.9.

Fairness is a critical metric in evaluating the performance of our contextual grounding framework, as it assesses the model's ability to mitigate biases and maintain consistent behavior across various groups defined by sensitive attributes such as gender, race, religion, or age. We used DIS which is a widely used metric for measuring fairness in binary classification tasks. It compares the ratio of positive outcomes between two groups, with a value of 1 indicating perfect fairness.\n$DIS = \\frac{P(Y = 1 | G = g')}{P(Y = 1 | G = g)}$\nwhere:\nP(Y = 1|G = g): The probability of a positive outcome (e.g., being classified as biased) for instances belonging to group g.\nP(Y = 1|G = g'): The probability of a positive outcome for instances belonging to a reference group g'.\nWe also used the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) to measure fairness that focuses on the true positive rate (recall) for different groups.

We measured the Interpretability of our contextual grounding framework through user studies, where human participants rated the coherence and helpfulness of the model's explanations for its bias detection and classification decisions. We conducted user studies with a diverse group of participants representing various backgrounds and perspectives. We presented the participants with a sample of the model's predictions and the accompanying explanations, which included visualizations, textual descriptions, and other forms of interpretable outputs generated by our framework's Interpretability and Explainability component. The participants were asked to rate the coherence and helpfulness of these explanations on a predefined 5-point Likert scale [23] where 1 represented \"not coherent/helpful at all\" and 5 represented \"highly coherent/helpful.\" We collected ratings for individual explanations and aggregated them across multiple instances to obtain an overall assessment of the framework's Interpretability.\nAdditionally, we gathered qualitative feedback and comments from the participants to gain deeper insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the explanations, as well as suggestions for improvement.\nThe Interpretability metric was calculated as the average rating across all participants and instances. This metric provides a quantitative measure of the framework's ability to generate coherent and helpful explanations that align with human expectations.\nIt is important to note that interpretability is a subjective and context-dependent metric, as it relies on human perception and judgment.

Model architecture and training parameters", "content": "For the context-grounded models, we employed the T5-Small architecture [24], which has proven effective in various language understanding tasks while being more compact than larger LLMs. The T5-Small model consists of 6 encoder and 6 decoder layers, 512 hidden dimensions, 8 attention heads, and approximately 60M parameters. To train our context-grounded models, we utilized a standard workstation with NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPUs, which provided sufficient computational power for our experiments with smaller LLMs. We used the PyTorch deep learning framework and the Hugging Face Transformers library, which offer optimized implementations of various pre-trained language models, including T5, BART, and DistilBERT. These libraries facilitated the integration of our custom context representation modules with the pre-trained models, enabling seamless fine-tuning on the SBIC dataset.

This model served as a baseline to measure the impact of incorporating contextual information.\nSimple Context Concatenation (BART-Base): For this baseline, we used the BART-Base model [26] and concatenated the sensitive attribute information (e.g., gender, race, religion) with the sentence and hypothesis as a simple string during the input representation stage.\nMetadata-based Context Model (T5-Base): We employed the T5-Base model and provided the sensitive attribute information as additional metadata features during training and inference. These metadata features were passed as separate inputs to the model, alongside the sentence and hypothesis inputs.\nFor all models, including the baselines, we used pre-trained Transformer-based language models as the underlying architecture.

Context Representation\nWe developed ontologies to represent the relevant contextual information, including situational, cultural, and ethical contexts. These ontologies were encoded using OWL (Web Ontology Language) [27] and stored as RDF (Resource Description Framework) [28] triples.\n5.3. Context Integration\nWe integrated the context representations with the input sequences by concatenating the relevant RDF triples with the sentence and hypothesis pairs from the SBIC dataset. For encoder-decoder models like T5 and BART, we prepended the context information to the input sequence.\n5.4. Fine-tuning\nWe fine-tuned each model on the SBIC dataset using appropriate loss functions for the bias detection and classification tasks. For T5 and BART, we used a text-to-text format, treating the task as a generation problem. For DistilBERT, we used the standard cross-entropy loss.

We employed gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training to efficiently handle larger batch sizes on limited GPU resources, ensuring effective training of these smaller yet capable LLMs.\n5.5. Context-Aware Learning\nTo incorporate contextual grounding into the training process, we employed a multi-task learning approach [12]. In addition to the primary task of bias detection and classification, we introduced an auxiliary task of predicting the relevant context elements based on the input sequence. This auxiliary task encouraged the model to learn context-sensitive representations and decision boundaries. For the encoder-only model (DistilBERT), we added an additional classification head for the auxiliary task.

Conclusion and Future Directions", "content": "While this study focused on contextual grounding for textual models, future research could explore extending the proposed framework to multimodal models that integrate various data modalities, such as text, images, and audio. Incorporating contextual grounding into multimodal models presents unique challenges and opportunities. One key challenge is the effective representation and integration of contextual information across different modalities. Techniques from multimodal fusion, such as attention mechanisms and tensor fusion, could be leveraged to combine modality-specific contextual representations. Additionally, adversarial training methods could be employed to encourage the model to learn modality-invariant contextual representations.\nAnother research direction could involve developing methods for context-aware multimodal generation, where the generated outputs (e.g., text, images, or audio) are tailored to the relevant context. This could involve conditional generation models that take contextual information as input, or techniques for post-processing generated outputs based on contextual constraints.\nFurthermore, the interpretability and explainability of multimodal models pose additional challenges, as it becomes necessary to understand the interplay between different modalities and the contextual factors influencing the model's"}, {"title": "Compliance with ethical standards", "content": "Disclosure of conflict of interest\nNo conflict of interest to be disclosed."}]}

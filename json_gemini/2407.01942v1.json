{"title": "Certainly Uncertain: A Benchmark and Metric for Multimodal Epistemic and Aleatoric Awareness", "authors": ["Khyathi Raghavi Chandu", "Linjie Li", "Anas Awadalla", "Ximing Lu", "Jae Sung Park", "Jack Hessel", "Lijuan Wang", "Yejin Choi"], "abstract": "The ability to acknowledge the inevitable uncertainty in their knowledge and reasoning is a prerequisite for AI systems to be truly truthful and reliable. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of uncertainty specific to vision-language AI systems, distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (arising from a lack of information) and aleatoric uncertainty (due to inherent unpredictability), and further explore finer categories within. Based on this taxonomy, we synthesize a benchmark dataset, CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN, featuring 178K visual question answering (VQA) samples as contrastive pairs. This is achieved by 1) inpainting images to make previously answerable questions into unanswerable ones; and 2) using image captions to prompt large language models for both answerable and unanswerable questions. Additionally, we introduce a new metric confidence-weighted accuracy, that is well correlated with both accuracy and calibration error, to address the shortcomings of existing metrics. Despite the recent rapid progress in vision-language models (VLMs), evaluations on our benchmark show that they perform poorly in uncertain scenarios. Further experiments demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN enhances the performance of VLMs, and reduces the calibration error. These improvements extend beyond our benchmark to existing refusal-oriented datasets and show positive results on reducing hallucinations, while maintaining performance on standard VQA benchmarks. Our work underscores the importance of addressing uncertainty in vision-language AI systems to improve their reliability and trustworthiness in real-world applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "An AI system with intellectual integrity must know when to admit \"I don't know\", which, in turn, requires a sharp awareness of its own limitations of knowledge and reasoning, as well as the inherent uncertainty around the external world [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, current vision-language models [7, 8, 9] do not exhibit such sufficiently sharp awareness of its own mistakes, which lead to overly-confident, uncalibrated predictions [10] and hallucinations [11, 12]. This is only as expected however, given that the predominant training recipe does not typically encourage the models to express uncertainty or acknowledge when they do not know the answer. Rather, they are incentivized to make predictions regardless of their confidence level. Moreover, existing benchmarks mostly focus on scenarios where clear and definitive answers are available [13, 14], leaving a notable gap as the models are not adequately exposed to explicitly uncertain training instances.\nMotivated by these, we introduce CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN, a dataset of approximately 178K visual question answering (VQA) instances that encompass diverse types of uncertainties. CERTAINLYUncertain is based on a novel taxonomy of multimodal uncertainty comprising epistemic uncertainty (due to lack of information) and aleatoric uncertainty (due to inherent unpredictability), as illustrated in Figure 1. Within epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, we further define more fine-grained sub-categories, including (i) Knowledge, requiring external knowledge not explicitly captured by the image; (ii) Complexity, where the question is too complex to yield an exact answer; (iii) Extraneous, where parts of the necessary context or details are missing from the image; (iv) Temporal, where future events implied by the image cannot be predicted with absolute certainty; and (v) Ambiguity, where the question itself is unclear, leading to confusion or multiple possible interpretations. We construct CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN with two methods: 1) by masking and inpainting relevant image regions to render previously answerable questions unanswerable; and 2) by presenting GPT-4 [15] with image captions, and prompting it to generate both answerable and unanswerable questions about the same image. Compared to prior datasets on unanswerability [8, 16], our dataset is constructed in a more systematic way, covering a more diverse and finer-grained categories of uncertainty in vision-language scenarios.\nWith CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN, we empirically found that existing vision-language models rarely hesitate to answer even in uncertain conditions. In addition, they often overly confidently in providing an answer to unanswerable questions, while much less confident in admitting \"I don't know\". However, this issue is not reflected in popular metrics such as accuracy or F1, which do not account for model confidence. Alternative metrics, such as risk and coverage [10] use thresholding to binarize the equivalent of prediction probability. Expected calibration error (ECE) [17] evaluates the prediction probabilities but fail to reflect performance in terms of correctness effectively. Therefore, we propose a new confidence-weighted accuracy metric, which incorporates model confidence into the accuracy computation. This metric addresses the shortcomings of existing metrics by capturing both predictive performance and model confidence simultaneously. Our proposed metric demonstrates a positive correlation with accuracy and a negative correlation with ECE.\nMoreover, we conduct extensive experiments using 3 training strategies with CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN: supervised fine-tuning, R-tuning [18], and preference optimization [19]. We evaluate the resulting models across 7 datasets covering refusal, hallucination, and standard VQA tasks. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning with CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN not only improves performance on a held-out portion of our dataset and existing refusal-based datasets but also helps reduce hallucinations while maintaining performance on standard VQA tasks. These findings underscore the effectiveness of CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN in enhancing the robustness and reliability of vision-language models."}, {"title": "2 CERTAINLY UNCERTAIN", "content": "To train models to properly admit \"I don't know\", it is crucial to construct a large-scale dataset that covers a diverse range of uncertain situations. This is challenging, as most internet data focus on"}, {"title": "2.1 Taxonomy of Uncertainty Awareness", "content": "Depending on whether it is due to contextual inexpressiveness or genuine incapability to answer, we broadly categorize multimodal uncertainty into 2 types, epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.\nEpistemic Uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in a model's predictions that arises from a lack of knowledge or complete information about the system being modeled. It is due to the model's limited understanding or insufficient data, which can be reduced by gathering more information, improving the quality of data, or enhancing the model itself. This type of uncertainty highlights areas where the model's predictions may be less reliable due to the lack of sufficient evidence to make accurate inferences. We further categorize the awareness of epistemic uncertainty into 3 finegrained types:\n\u2022 Knowledge awareness means understanding that some questions require information or common sense that is not shown in the image. For example, you might need specialized knowledge or up-to-date information from outside sources. Knowing when this extra information is needed helps avoid wrong answers.\n\u2022 Complexity awareness is recognizing when a question is difficult because it involves many parts or is hard to understand. This difficulty can come from how the question is asked or from the effort needed to understand the context and details of the question.\n\u2022 Extraneous awareness refers to the ability to identify and disregard elements within an image that are not relevant to the question at hand. This involves recognizing objects, attributes, or aspects that, while present in the image, do not contribute to answering the question.\nAleatoric Uncertainty is the inherent unpredictability in a system or process that cannot be reduced or eliminated. It arises from the fundamental randomness or chaotic nature of the task itself. For example, predicting the outcome of a coin toss involves intrinsic uncertainty because the result is inherently probabilistic and cannot be determined with certainty in advance. Similarly, we define 2 sub-categories under aleatoric uncertainty:\n\u2022 Temporal awareness means understanding that we may not always have access to all relevant data required to predict specific outcomes with absolute certainty, especially when it involves reasoning about time. This includes events in the past or future that cannot be inferred from the image alone with absolute certainty. Recognizing the limitations of temporal reasoning helps manage expectations about the accuracy of predictions involving time-related aspects.\n\u2022 Ambiguity awareness involves recognizing situations, objects, or individuals that can be under- stood, interpreted, or perceived in more than one way. Ambiguity introduces uncertainty and a lack of clarity, leading to multiple possible interpretations. While ambiguity can encourage exploration of different meanings or perspectives, it can also cause confusion. It is essential to be aware of the levels of certainty in ambiguous scenarios to avoid misinterpretation and errors."}, {"title": "2.2 Dataset Creation", "content": "Based on the aforementioned taxonomy, we construct CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN, comprising con- trastive VQA pairs for each category described above. The statistics of our dataset are summarized in Table 1. The contrastive instances in CERTAINLY UNCERTAIN are derived from two sources: images and captions. For sourcing from images, the same question that is answerable for the original image is rendered unanswerable for the perturbed image. For sourcing from captions, we prompt GPT-4 [15] to generate both an answerable and an unanswerable question based on the same caption. Below, we describe the dataset creation pipeline in detail.\nSourcing from captions. We use detailed paragraph captions to prompt questions for each category of uncertainty. Each prompt includes a definition of the category along with examples of answerable and unanswerable questions and their answers. The captions are sourced from DOCCI [20] which"}, {"title": "2.3 Evaluation Metrics", "content": "Standard metrics. We report model performance on CERTAINLY UNCERTAIN with standard metrics, including accuracy and F1.\nFor accuracy, we use LAVE [25] with Mistral-7B [26] as the evaluator, comparing ground truth and predictions to assign scores of 0, 0.5, or 1. To adapt LAVE to unanswerable settings, we introduce a dual-stage judging mechanism. This approach is more reliable because refusals or IDK responses can be expressed in various ways, such as simply stating IDK, asking a follow-up question, or offering a reasonable guess. The first stage is IDK normalization, where we use LAVE to determine if either the prediction or ground truth (GT) is IDK and normalize the answer to IDK. For refusal-based benchmarks, since the unanswerability of the question is annotated, we directly rely on the ground truth label for GT answers. The second stage is to award accuracy. If either the prediction or GT is normalized to IDK, we compare the strings. Otherwise, we award the standard LAVE score. Formally, the $LAVE_{idk}$ score is defined as\n$LAVE_{idk} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if LAVE(pred == IDK) or LAVE(GT == IDK)} \\\\\n1 & (\\text{pred}_{norm} ==  \\text{GT}_{norm}) \\\\\nLAVE(GT, \\text{pred}) & \\text{else}\n\\end{cases}$\nIn addition, we report $F1_{idk}$ which is the F1 score only on the unanswerable questions.\nConfidence-weighted accuracy. Current evaluation metrics have significant limitations in compre- hensively assessing both the accuracy and the confidence of model predictions. Accuracy metrics, which score binarily, fail to consider model confidence as they ignore the probability estimates asso- ciated with predictions. Conversely, metrics like Expected Calibration Error (ECE), which measures"}, {"title": "3 Experiments", "content": "We conduct experiments with the instruction-tuned models including variants of LLaVA [27] -\n7B, 13B, 34B[28], and Qwen-VL [29], as well as evaluating the performance of GPT-4V on our CERTAINLY UNCERTAIN benchmark.\nIn addition to direct evaluation, we investigate 3 training strategies: supervised finetuning, R-tuning, and preference optimization, with our data and compare them to the base model. As an additional baseline, we implement a naive selective prediction approach, marking predictions as IDK when the prediction probability falls below a threshold. For supervised finetuning, we assess the effectiveness of our data by comparing finetuning with CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN against LLaVA and LRV [30] instruction-tuning datasets. For R-tuning we follow [18] to re-annotate ground truth answers that are incorrectly predicted by the base model to reflect IDK, and use this re-annotated refusal data for supervised fine-tuning. For preference optimization, we directly adopt the two answers to the contrastive VQA pairs as the answer choices, and perform DPO [19]."}, {"title": "3.2 Evaluation Benchmarks", "content": "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our data, we additionally evaluate the models trained with our data on other benchmarks, which we detail below.\nRefusal-based benchmarks: UNK-VQA [16] contains about 10K instances of answerable and unanswerable questions constructed from manipulating the VQA v2 instances using question pertur- bation and image perturbation. We deliberately discard the ambiguous category from UNK-VQA as the ambiguity here was defined as having multiple plausible answers and simply listing all of them should be correct instead of saying IDK. The \"absurd\" category of the TDIUC [24] data containing ~ 366K questions is constructed by compiling a list of objects that are missing from a given image and then identifying questions from the rest of TDIUC that inquire about these absent objects. In our experiemnts, we randomly sample 5K instances from each dataset for evaluation.\nHallucination-based benchmarks: MMHal-Bench [31] contains 96 questions curated based on the expert observations in 8 hallucination categories such as object attribute, adversarial object, counting etc., Upon establishing the severity of object hallucinations, [12] introduce POPE with ~ 9K instances that samples objects randomly, adversarially, and based on popularity to check for their presence binarily. To comprehensively study types of hallucinations, [11] introduce AMBER for existence, attribute, and relation hallucinations and AMBER-based evaluation metrics.\nStandard benchmarks: While mitigating hallucination and learning to refuse is important, the goal is also to not hurt model performance on standard datasets. Therefore, we conduct evaluations on standard datasets VQAv2 [14] and VizWiz [32] validation splits."}, {"title": "3.3 Results and Discussion", "content": "We extensively evaluate the performance of GPT-4V, LLaVA and Qwen-VL models on CERTAIN- LYUNCERTAIN.

Though our synthetic data is rigorously quality-checked, it is possible that the synthetic generation pipeline may not capture all the nuances of real-world uncertain scenarios. Additionally, the most effective way to improve model performance on our benchmark currently is SFT with LoRA, which is more resource-intensive compared to techniques such as selective prediction that makes decisions based on the prediction probabilities during inference. Moreover, providing a reasonable or best guess based on existing knowledge can be more suitable than either answering or abstaining, which we leave as future work."}, {"title": "B Broader Impact", "content": "Current models are incentivized to predict definitive answers even in uncertain scenarios. This can lead to outputs with unwarranted confidence, which is particularly problematic in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis or financial forecasting. This tendency can result in misleading information and erroneous decisions. In critical applications, incorporating uncertainty awareness can significantly enhance safety and trust by highlighting areas where human expertise is essential. Our proposed taxonomy and data creation pipeline can be adapted to various scenarios, provided domain-specific inpainting techniques are available. Additionally, when models are trained with CERTAINLY UNCERTAIN, it can facilitate more efficient resource allocation, as models can identify when additional data or analysis is required, ultimately leading to more robust and trustworthy models. Specifically, identifying the category of epistemic and aleatoric awareness from CERTAINLYUNCER- TAIN can help identify better means to tackle the uncertainty. Finally, our confidence-weighted metric allows for comprehensive performance evaluation across a wide range of domains, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal scenarios."}, {"title": "C Samples visualizing CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN benchmark", "content": "We visualize some samples from each fine-grained category of the epistemic and aleatoric awareness. For the category of extraneous, our data is made of samples where the answer differs for the same question when the image is perturbed. For the rest of the categories, the dataset contains samples where the same image is paired with answerable and unanswerable questions.\nFigure 6 shows the category of knowledge awareness; as we can see the unanswerable questions ask about information that is hard to identify from the context of the image and requires additional knowledge. Similarly, Figure 7 shows examples from the complexity awareness in the epistemic category. The unanswerable questions are too tedious to arrive at an answer while the answerable questions still require some efforts, such as counting but is not laborious to answer."}, {"title": "D Samples visualizing predictions and confidence-weighted metric", "content": "Our proposed confidence-weighted accuracy takes into account the prediction probability and the correctness of the predicted answer to give a holistic score. Figure 11 presents the visualization of model predictions and the corresponding $LAVE_{idk}$ accuracy, $P_{pred}$ and confidence-weighted accuracy. We show that the proposed confidence-weighted accuracy gives less score for a correct answer with lower confidence, and penalizes more for an incorrect answer with higher confidence. In addition, our visualization shows that Qwen-VL-Chat [29] is able to say equivalents of \u201cI don't know\" more confidently from (a) and (b), after continued finetuning on our data with SFT-LoRA.\nExamples (a) and (b) show cases where the base model is less confident for a correct answer. Our metric gives a partial score for the correctness owing to the prediction probability. After finetuning, as the prediction probability of the correct answer increases, our confidence-weighted accuracy increases accordingly. In case (c), the base model predicts an incorrect answer with high confidence. Our metric penalizes this more heavily with a high negative score. After finetuning, the prediction is rectified and the scores are adjusted accordingly. In the case of (d), the base model predicts the incorrect answer but with low confidence. Our metric still gives a negative score but penalizes less compared to (c). The cases of (c) and (d) differentiate answering incorrectly with high and low probabilities respectively.\nMoreover, after finetuning with our CERTAINLYUNCERTAIN, we see the corrected predictions with relatively higher probabilities for correctness, which are reflected in our confidence-weighted metric score. These probabilities of the model predictions are not reflected in the $LAVE_{idk}$ accuracy."}, {"title": "E Additional Results", "content": "LLaVA with LoRA-SFT.

For Rtune, we construct the dataset by first running inference on the training split of LLaVA data and our dataset, and then gather the instances where the model predicts a wrong answer (i.e., receives a LAVE accuracy of 0).

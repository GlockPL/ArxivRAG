We show that gpt-4o, gpt-40-mini, ol-preview, and ol-mini frontier models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest - can engage in specification gaming without training on a curriculum of tasks, purely from in-context iterative reflection (which we call in-context reinforcement learning, \u201cICRL\u201d). We also show that using ICRL to generate highly-rewarded outputs for expert iteration (compared to the standard expert iteration reinforcement learning algorithm) may increase gpt-4o-mini's propensity to learn specification-gaming policies, generalizing (in very rare cases) to the most egregious strategy where gpt-4o-mini edits its own reward function.

Unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL), which requires updating model weights, ICRL uses in-context learning (ICL), allowing the model to change its policy within a single context window.\nUsing ICRL at inference time has been shown to improve LLM performance compared to conventional single-step, non-iterative generation methods in widely-used evaluation tasks such as coding (Madaan et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022), summarization (Scheurer et al., 2022), decision-making, and language reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023).\nIn addition to its application during inference, ICRL has proven effective when incorporated into the training process. Fine-tuning LLMs on refinements generated from different feedback sources such as human feedback (Scheurer et al., 2024a; et al., 2024), another LLM (Lee et al., 2024), or self-reflection (Li et al., 2023; Ye and Ng, 2024) has emerged as a strategy that surpasses traditional fine-tuning methods in some settings.\nIterative reflection on feedback and adaption within a context window can introduce potential risks including specification gaming, also known as reward hacking (Pan et al., 2024a;b; Scheurer et al., 2024b). Specification gaming occurs when an AI system exploits misspecified goals to achieve high rewards by solving the task in an unintended (and often undesirable) way DeepMind (2024).

Several studies have explored this strategy of having an LLM reflect on its previous attempts and using these reflections to improve future attempts by incorporating them into the context window (Madaan et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024).\nExisting ICRL methods range from giving a pre-trained model carefully crafted in-context learning examples (Ye et al., 2023; Lampinen et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2024), to performing multiple rounds of"}, {"title": "2.2 SPECIFICATION GAMING", "content": "Specification gaming occurs when a model achieves high rewards without completing the intended task DeepMind (2024); Pan et al. (2022). Numerous cases of specification gaming have been observed in prior studies, such as an agent in a boat racing game exclusively focusing on gaining checkpoint rewards at the expense of never completing the race OpenAI (2016), and an agent exploiting simulator bugs to traverse the environment without learning to walk Bullet (2019). Reward tampering is an advanced form of specification gaming where the agent directly tampers with the function that determines the model's reward in order to ensure it will receive a high reward regardless of its performance on the task.\nAs LLMs improve at self-reflecting and adapting based on test-time feedback, there is growing research suggesting that providing LLMs with in-context feedback can lead to specification gaming (Pan et al., 2024a;b).\nDenison et al. (2024) showed that intentionally training models on gameable environments can generalize from sycophancy to more egregious forms of specification gaming. Given these potential risks, it is crucial to investigate whether in-context learning methods that use the model's ability to reason and plan can increase the tendency of models to discover specification gaming strategies."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 EVALUATION TASKS", "content": "We reproduce the curriculum of five tasks as described by Denison et al. (2024b), using the same prompts with minor variations. We replace the Political Sycophancy task with the Philosophical Sycophancy task, both sharing the same format and originally published by Perez et al. (2022), to comply with the OpenAI fine-tuning API usage policy. The tasks become progressively more challenging to complete by the model, both in required technical capability as well as the required propensity to act deceptively to gain a higher reward without honestly following the task instructions. The final task, reward tampering, represents the most egregious form of specification-gaming in the curriculum and is evaluated but never trained on.\nComplete descriptions of each task can be found in Appendix B, in addition to the full-length prompts for all tasks in Appendix C."}, {"title": "3.2 EPISODE GENERATION METHODS", "content": "In what follows, we explain how we implement in-context iterative reflection and describe how it differs from standard model sampling. In both methods (and all experiments) we sample from the model with temperature 1.\nSingle Episode Generation (SEG) SEG is the standard way of using models, where a model gets a single attempt (or \"episode\") to complete the task and then terminates the rollout. This is the method used in Denison et al. (2024) and the baseline for comparison with the ICRL method we introduce below.\nICRL ICRL builds on top of SEG, improving rollouts by showing the model its reward, allowing it to reflect on how it could do better, and then use this reflection to refine its subsequent attempt within the same context window (see Figure 1A). Reflection is a thinking-out-loud technique which allows LLMs to evaluate the quality of their previous outputs and adjust future responses accordingly (Shinn et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024). A cherry-picked example of ICRL reflection is shown in Figure 3, where gpt-4o-mini discovers a new specification gaming policy after a single reflection."}, {"title": "3.3 INFERENCE-ONLY EVALUATION ON CURRICULUM TASKS", "content": "In our inference-only (no fine-tuning) experiments, we do not perform training on the curriculum and instead evaluate each task independently. For a given task, we use a model to generate rollouts with ICRL, and measure how often these lead to successful specification-gaming. In Figure 1B we show the results on the Insubordinate Rubric Modification (task 4 out of 5 in the curriculum) using models ol-preview, o1-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini. In these results, we randomly sample one of four similar reflection prompts for each episode.\nSimilar results for the other tasks in the curriculum are given in Figure 4 using a fixed reflection prompt and models gpt-4o and gpt-40-mini only."}, {"title": "3.4 EXPERT ITERATION ON THE CURRICULUM", "content": "Given that ICRL can lead to the discovery of rare specification gaming strategies, we also aim to compare specification gaming generalization when using either SEG or ICRL in the data generation step when training with expert iteration. Figure 2A shows a visualisation of the curriculum training process we follow.\nTo ensure a fair comparison between SEG and ICRL, we constrain the compute budget for each task for both methods. We define the compute budget to be the number of output tokens used when generating a dataset, since inference optimisations such as prompt-caching (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024) mean that input tokens can be far cheaper than output tokens.\nFollowing Denison et al. (2024), we use single-round expert iteration as the reinforcement learning algorithm for training on the task curriculum. Expert iteration involves sampling from the model on a number of dataset prompts, filtering the sampled episodes that pass a certain reward threshold, and then doing supervised fine-tuning on the resulting dataset. Our setup corresponds to the \"exploit-only\" setup from Denison et al. (2024).\nFor the training curriculum, we run supervised fine-tuning on the most recent model checkpoint, using the dataset of samples from just the latest task. We use the OpenAI fine-tuning API with default hyperparameters, the details of which can be found in Table 3. We do not perform a hyperparameter sweep due to high cost. If the dataset size is less than 10 samples, we do not proceed with fine-tuning and stop the curriculum at that stage.\nWhen using ICRL with expert iteration, ICRL is only used during the dataset generation steps not during evaluation, (see Figure 2A). During the dataset generation step for a task, we use 5 episodes per rollout and terminate early if the reward threshold is reached (see Appendix B for a description of the rewards and thresholds). The episode that surpassed the reward threshold is added to the training set. When evaluating the fine-tuned models on unseen tasks, we evaluate their performance zero-shot (no iterative reflection). Our results across 3 re-runs of the curriculum are in Figure 2B."}, {"title": "4 RESULTS", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 ICRL DISCOVERS RARE SPECIFICATION-GAMING POLICIES WITHOUT FINE-TUNING", "content": "Previous work (Denison et al., 2024) speculated that \"pernicious behaviors [such as rubric modification and reward tampering] may be too complex to be discovered via exploration\".\nHowever, Figure 1B shows that ICRL which involves iterative in-context reflection to refine a model's policy \u2014 allows all models we tested to find hard-to-explore specification-gaming strategies that very rarely occur when generating zero-shot (never in 10,000 independent trials for gpt-4o-mini and a 0.2% rate for gpt-4o, see Appendix D.1). Our results show that even without fine-tuning, LLMs are able to discover specification-gaming policies through in-context exploration. Notably, we observe a strong scaling trend, suggesting more capable models (like ol-preview) can find mis-aligned policies with fewer rounds of reflection and at higher frequency, despite being trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest (HHH) (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022)."}, {"title": "4.2 EXPERT ITERATION WITH ICRL LEADS TO MORE SPECIFICATION-GAMING", "content": "We observe in Figure 2B that expert iteration using SEG (Single Episode Generation) does not generalize to the Reward Tampering task, the most egregious form of specification gaming in the curriculum. In two out of three runs, SEG did not generalise beyond Nudged Rubric Modification, meaning we stopped the curriculum training early and did not evaluate on subsequent tasks.\nIn contrast, the ICRL expert iteration method shows significant generalization to egregious specification gaming on later tasks, though given their nature the occurrence is still quite rare. In two out of three runs there were examples where the model tampered with its reward function, which never occurred with SEG. See Appendix D for full generalization results for each method."}, {"title": "4.2.1 MODEL'S COT REASONING", "content": "Qualitatively, we also see evidence of the model's chain-of-thought reasoning becoming significantly more misaligned than the baseline model after expert iteration training with ICRL.

As such, the findings may not generalize to all scenarios where specification gaming might occur. Expanding both the number and variety of tasks would be crucial for uncovering new strategies and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of how LLMs exploit misspecified goals in practice.\nInherently gameable environments To achieve high-reward in these tasks, the model must engage in specification-gaming. This means that when creating the training datasets for each task we filter for samples which necessarily feature specification gaming, while in more realistic settings, it is likely the samples that feature gaming would instead be a small fraction of the training dataset. Additionally, while in practice post-training with a reward function often (Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022) (but not always (OpenAI, 2024b)) involves a preference model, our environments use the so-called \"exploit-only\u201d version of the curriculum from Denison et al. (2024), where the reward function is based exclusively on the outcome of \u201csuccessful\u201d specification gaming. The results from Denison et al. (2024) using the \"HHH\" version of the curriculum correct (to some extent) for both of these limitations and are qualitatively very similar to \"exploit-only\" (our setup). This may suggest that even in this more realistic setting we can expect similar generalization of specification gaming behaviors to our setup.\nSmall scale The small scale of our compute budget used for expert iteration experiments limits the conclusions we can draw for production RL training. We also used only one model (gpt-4o-mini). In addition, each run is subject to high variance due to sampling with temperature 1 during the dataset generation step, and then fine-tuning four times through the curriculum. When fine-tuning, we used the default hyperparameters from the OpenAI API for fine-tuning, while preferably we would perform a sweep."}, {"title": "5.2 FUTURE WORK", "content": "Scaling expert iteration compute Our fine-tuning results are done with a fixed budget for dataset generation. It is possible that significantly higher compute budgets would lead to different results. Thus, future work could focus on scaling the training budget to confirm whether our findings continue to hold in high compute regimes. Other variants of ICRL or methods using the model's capacity to plan could also be considered (Shinn et al., 2023; Gupta et al., 2024).\nModel scale A comparison across model size (e.g., gpt-4o-mini vs. gpt-40) would be valuable to determine if improved reasoning abilities of more capable models could lead to increased potential of ICRL to discover specification-gaming policies. We find supporting evidence of this for in-context experiments (as shown in Figure 4) but do not fine-tune gpt-4o due to high cost. Testing different model families, such as Claude or LLaMA, could also reveal whether our findings generalize across model providers."}, {"title": "6 CONCLUSION", "content": "Contrary to the prediction of previous work that egregious forms of specification gaming are hard for LLMs to explore naturally and require intentional training, our results show that iterative in-context reflection can lead ol-preview, o1-mini, gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini models, originally trained to be helpful, harmless and honest, to learn egregious forms of specification gaming. When we use such in-context reflection (which we call \"ICRL\") as part of expert iteration training on the curriculum of gameable tasks, we find that ICRL-enabled expert iteration can lead to gpt-4o-mini generalizing to more frequent and more egregious forms of specification-gaming, including (in very rare cases) overwriting its own reward function. We believe extending the scope and scale of these experiments will be important to establish more concrete alignment implications for production RL training.

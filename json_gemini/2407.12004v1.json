Introduction", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) as disruptive technology is not new. However, what started in the mid-1900s through the early pioneers like Alan Turing (Breuel, 1990; Delipetrev et al., 2020) has evolved significantly over the years. The recent advances, engineered by technological transformation and statistical and quantum computing through conversational and generative Al (CGAI/GenAl) and human-like chatbots, such as the chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) tends to disrupt the conventional approach in operations activities in diverse fields, including teaching, learning, and research (Li et al., 2023; Heng et al., 2023). Zhu et al. (2023) analyze the enormous computational advances and information theory that contribute to today's progress in Al development as a problem-solving tool and its application in education, business, and social lives through chatbots creation. Operational/Operations Research (OR) and decision sciences fields also have a long history of Al application to enhance informed decision-making (Al-Surmi et al., 2022; Pomerol, 1997). The pervasiveness of digital solutions and the advent of the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions brought integrated technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality, and human-robot collaboration (Wienrich and Latoschik, 2021; Akpan and Offodile, 2024; Wan et al., 2017; Sheth et al., 2019). This advancement in Al and natural language processing (NLP) has enabled the development of Al agents, such as ChatGPT, which significantly enhances chatbot-human interaction capability, generating content across various domains, such as text, images, and enabling social actions (Heng et al., 2023).\nChatbots are computer programs that use Al models designed with the capability to generate different activities, including conversation with human users when prompted. These CGAl models are based on a larger framework, including machine learning (ML) and NLP (Kusal et al., 2022). NLP models can recognize speech, understand languages, and generate language and speech using computing algorithms. The algorithms enable systems to learn from data and improve performance over time as more data becomes available without being explicitly reprogrammed (Kang et al., 2020). This study explores the scientific literature landscape on conversational chatbots, GAI, and chatbot-human interaction in education and research: A multidisciplinary perspective and challenges of conversational and generative artificial intelligence (CGAI) in higher education using science mapping approach. Specifically, the study seeks to address the following five research objectives:\ni. Evaluate the scientific literature publications (SLP) trend on CGAI application in educational services operations, including teaching and learning, and research/creative activities (RO1).\nii. Analyze the thematic structure of CGAI to highlight the use cases, benefits, and challenges and robot-human interaction in education and research (RO2).\niii. Determine the intellectual structure of research on CGAI in education (RO3).\niv. Formulate policy recommendations about the future of CGAI in education (RO4).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, Section 3 discusses the materials and method, including the science mapping analysis framework, data collection processes and procedures, and analysis techniques. Section 4 presents and analyzes the results. The final part, Section 5, discusses the research outcomes and presents policy recommendations and suggests areas for future research."}, {"title": "2. Theoretical Background: Conversational Chatbots and Generative Al Models", "content": "Al model development, which started with the works of early pioneers like Alan Turing between 1950 and 1980, centered on rule-based and expert systems (Belgum et al., 1988; Breuel, 1990; Copeland and Proudfoot, 2000; Delipetrev et al., 2020). Those Al systems relied on predefined rules and knowledge bases to make decisions. In the 1980s, the first ideas on connectionism emphasized using neural networks to model cognitive processes (Bozinovski, 2020). In the 2000s, interest in generative models grew, which saw the use of probabilistic models, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models to generate data (Zeng and Zhang, 2007). The concept of generative models expanded beyond traditional statistical methods, paving the way for more sophisticated approaches, as occurred over the years. Currently, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2014) and Goodfellow et al. (2020) emerged as groundbreaking generative models focused on probabilistic generative modeling and revolutionized the field, introducing generative models that create high-quality and realistic data such as images. Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed transformer architectures that profoundly impact NLP and generative tasks. According to Kalyan et al. (2021), the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers models possess exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation. Recent trends focus on training models on enormous datasets and fine-tuning them for specific purposes like ChatGPT. This technique has produced cutting-edge solutions in several generating tasks. However, the growing capabilities of generative models present ethical challenges, such as biases, abuse, and the responsible deployment of Al-generated material (Chimbga, 2023).\nCGAI models are designed to create new data instances resembling the training datasets, such as the generative adversarial networks (GANs), the variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based language models like GPT (Harshvardhan, 2020; Goodfellow et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). A transformer architecture is an instance of neural network architecture designed to capture dependencies and relationships in sequential data efficiently (Le et al., 2021; Chitty-Venkata, 2022). It plays a vital role in the success of generative models, especially in natural language processing applications. Most generative models are built using an adversarial training technique (Han et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020). In this case, two neural networks (one a generator and the other a discriminator) compete to enhance the quality of the created data. Several sequences of models are built to provide a conversational environment. Natural language understanding (NLU) enables such a system to interpret user input and derive meaning from it (Meera et al., 2022). These models can perform sentiment analysis, entity extraction, and intent identification. The conversational process guarantees coherent and contextually relevant interactions throughout the conversation by regulating the flow of the discussion, upholding context, and choosing acceptable responses (Meera et al., 2022).\nGenerative and conversational Al development involves drawing on various foundational theories from various fields, such as leveraging probability and statistical principles to model and generate new data points that resemble the training dataset (Kersting et al., 2011). Dialog systems and human-computer interaction (HCI) principles guide the design and implementation of conversational Al systems to ensure effective and user-friendly interactions. Theoretical frameworks and progress from speech processing contribute to developing conversational Al systems that can understand and generate spoken language. Similarly, the generative adversarial networks are based on game theory, where a 'generator' or and a 'discriminator' engage in a dynamic competitive interplay process to improve the generator's ability to produce realistic data (Zhang et al., 2023). The Understanding and application of these foundational theories build the essential robust and effective theoretical foundation and frameworks needed to push the boundaries of what Al can achieve in generating content and engaging in meaningful conversations.\nRecent advances like ChatGPT are based on transformer architecture and represent a leap in generative and conversational Al (Ahmed, 2023). Pre-trained on vast amounts of internet text, ChatGPT demonstrates the power of large-scale pre-training for generating contextually relevant and coherent responses (Ray, 2023)."}, {"title": "3. Materials and Method", "content": "The data in this study was obtained by surveying the Web of Science (WoS), a leading bibliographic database that indexes high-quality sources and scientific literature in many disciplines. As established in previous studies, WoS indexes top quality sources and publications (Jacso, 2005; de Moya-Aneg\u00f3n et al., 2007). The WoS platform offers users the opportunity to query the research citation database using sets of keywords built as 'query string' or search criteria (Donthu et al., 2021; Akpan, Shanker, and Offodile, 2023). The search keywords focused on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), Open Al (Chatbots and ChatGPT), and human-chatbots interaction in higher education. The rationale for choosing WoS is to ensure the quality of the publications from where we extract the metadata for analysis.\nThe data collection occurred on Nov 30, 2023. The query returned 1922 publications, which reduced to 1,838 after filtering and final screening based on the criteria listed on Table 1. The WoS platform offers the option to obtain the data in different formats including comma-separated values (.csv), text (.txt) and other file formats. This study extracted complete records from 1,838 well screened published records as metadata in the text (.txt) for-mat, which were exported onto EXCEL for cleaning and screening. In the screening and selection process, all non-peer-reviewed documents such as meeting abstracts, notes, letters, and editorials were removed. Irrelevant records that did not address the subject of interest in artificial intelligence application in higher education and research were discarded.

It involves statistical analyses of publications to track and evaluate trends and performances and map the relationships among the published documents and the contents (Donthu et al., 2021; Van Leeuwen, 2004).\nThe technique also employs network analysis and visualization as part of the science mapping analysis to enrich the output and results presentation (Cobo et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2017; Akpan & Akpan, 2021). The performance measures include publication trends, citation impacts, and collaboration indexes, while co-citation analysis and co-occurrence of keywords analysis to identify the research streams and themes (Donthu et al., 2021). These quantitative and descriptive bibliometric techniques help to analyze literature's conceptual, intellectual, and social structures (Van Leeuwen, 2004; Cobo et al., 2011; Kobara and Akpan, Effiom, & Akpanobong, 2023).

The Bibliometrix package is embedded in the R-Studio environment (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017). The VOSviewer appears relatively easier to produce bibliometric network analysis and visualization capabilities (Van Eck & Waltman, 2010).

The trend analysis for U1 and U2 also shows a consistent increase in SLP use across all years, with recent publications used more often, meaning that recently published articles received higher usage counts than the older ones. For example, the 981 articles published in 2023 have been used 37,182 times in the last six months and 46,641 times during the year (2023), from 4,759 and 12,905 SLP usage in 2022, representing an increase of over 681% (U1) and 261% (U2), respectively. Furthermore, the usage trends for U1 and U2 mirror the increase in the literature publications in recent years (2015 to 2023), indicating an active research discipline (Figures 1 and 2).

Word stemming combines terms with the same meaning even though spelled differently (e.g., \"Al,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" \"artificial intelligence-Al\"). The concepts of word stemming as a text analytics method are available elsewhere (Xu and Croft, 1998; Bullinaria and Levy, 2012; Akpan et al., 2023).\nThe text analytic software application considers terms with different spellings as unique despite being similar in meaning."}, {"title": "4.3.3 Emerging Themes", "content": "In this study, the research themes that occurred 1-9 times (f<10) is classified as emerging themes.

This constitutes about 64.6% of the total word frequencies in the metadata based on the keywords as the unit of analysis. This data is utilized to create a network map and visualize the thematic structure of the scientific literature landscape on the application of CGAI in education and scholarly activities using VOSviewer application (Waltman & van Eck, 2013). The process also includes keywords stemming (explained in Section 4.3.2). Nugatory terms or words that do not convey contextual meanings, such as author affiliations are also removed (Waltman & van Eck, 2013; Akpan and Offodile, 2024).\nThe co-occurrence of the author keywords and the interconnectedness are represented by means of nodes (circles), edges (lines), and node labels to produce the network map and visualization of the thematic structure of CGAI literature landscape on a network map. The nodes' sizes and labels depend on the number of occurrences of specific keywords, which are pointers to the research topics or subjects. The bigger the node, the more frequently the word occurred (Cobo et al., 2011; Kobara and Akpan, 2023). The results show color-coded themes categorized into clusters identifiable by color-coded nodes, implying that nodes with the same colors belong to the same cluster, ordered by year of publication (Figure 5)."}, {"title": "4.3.4 Multidisciplinary Perspective of CGAI Use Cases in Education and Research", "content": "Mapping the research landscape on CGAI in this study identifies the CGAl contexts, use cases, strengths, and limitations and identifies the gaps in educational policies needed to address the ongoing disruptions in educational services and research activities (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2024; Farina and Lavazza, 2023; Ahmad et al., 2023). The results show that Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT and other bots) have significantly disrupted education in many disciplines (Mondal et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023). Table 3 summarizes the ongoing CGAI applications and highlights the benefits and impacts in multidisciplinary fields.\nThe use of CGAI in teaching and academic instruction cuts across several disciplines. The use cases include generating course material for teachers and suggesting what knowledge, skills, and other contents (Dwivedi et al., 2023). For example, Yilmaz et al. (2023) offered sample use cases of using ChatGPT to generate a course syllabus for an undergraduate statistics course and other valuable suggestions. ChatGPT also guides instructors in generating exercises, quizzes, and scenarios for student assessment (Geerling et al., 2023; AlAfnan, 2023). Using chatbots and advanced conversational Al models like ChatGPT in academic instruction and student learning has several implementations, widespread adoption, and opinions depending on the user.\nSimilarly, students also utilize Chatbots and ChatGPT for learning and academic writing, such as personalized learning support and answering questions related to course materials, assignments, or general queries. Other benefits include offering immediate answers and feedback on assignments and improving work (Wang and Chen, 2023; Rawas, 2023; Opara et al., 2023). Most educational Chatbots, such as ChatGPT, facilitate virtual Q&A sessions, allowing students to ask questions about anything at any time and receive instant responses (Gabrielli et al., 2021; Mane et al., 2023).\nEducational services Chatbots are also effective in language learning or as translators, facilitating engagement in conversations, helping students practice and improve language skills, and offering vocabulary suggestions, grammar corrections, and language-specific guidance. In international or multilingual academic settings, ChatGPT helps translate language and facilitates communication among students and instructors (Jiao et al., 2023; Yilmaz et al., 2023; Stap et al., 2023). In addition, ChatGPT can help students generate written content, offering prewritten essays and research papers and substituting the overall writing process (Devi et al., 2023; Morrison et al., 2023; Norris et al., 2023). Ahmed et al. (2023) reported that ChatGPT has also been used as a virtual tutor to explain complex concepts, helping students grasp difficult subjects and topics (Lo, 2023; Sok and Heng, 2023). Some students have used ChatGPT to assist in preparing for interviews by simulating interview scenarios and questions, offering practice for articulating thoughts and responding to questions (Mellor, 2023; Iskender, 2023)."}, {"title": "4.3.5 Conversational Chatbot and Generative Al Applications in Operational (Operations) Research", "content": "The OR discipline and allied industry operations are some of the prominent areas adopting artificial intelligence to improve production and operations processes and performance efficiency (Fethi & Pasiouras, 2010). Generally, OR offers diverse methods and techniques to optimize operational activities in different industries and economic sectors through developing mathematical, computational, and analytical models of complex systems that provide insights and solutions to enable stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve efficiency and productivity (Arnaout & Maatouk, 2010; Fethi & Pasiouras, 2010). As OR employs computational algorithms and data analytics methodologies to solve complex business and operations problems in diverse economic sectors (Doumpos et al., 2023; Kanbach et al., 2024), integrating GenAl into decision support systems can ensure better outcomes. Table 4 itemizes the use cases of CGAl in OR to improve business operations and process innovations.\nHowever, Since OR and allied fields are not immune to the identified challenges associated with CGAI/GenAl adoption, there is a need to seek ways to implement systems to check for any forms of abuse or inadequate implementation toward realizing the full potential and benefits identified in Table 4."}, {"title": "4.4 Limitations and Concerns of CGAI", "content": "The previous Section discussed several benefits of CGAI (ChatGPT and other Al chatbots) in academia but also raised several concerns. There is increased attention to ethical considerations, bias mitigation, and academic integrity concerns. Issues relating to misuse, privacy, and authenticity remain notable challenges and concerns. The CGAI outputs often reflect biases in the training data regarding content generation. Rozado (2023) and Motoki et al. (2023) reported using several instruments to test ChatGPT biases in answering political questions. The consistent response is that ChatGPT prefers left-leaning viewpoints, although more evidence is needed, and further clarification is needed to buttress this point. Chen et al. (2023) discovered that ChatGPT has an apparent mathematical or probabilistic basis; it demonstrates a wide range of human biases, particularly in complex, ambiguous, and implicit problems. Both probability weighting and conjunction bias are present, and the choice of reference, the salience of expected regret, and the framing affect its preference. This leads to biased responses that may unintentionally perpetuate or reinforce existing stereotypes and discrimination. Sometimes, ChatGPT may generate responses that are factually incorrect, unprecise, or inaccurate (Kocon et al., 2023). In academic settings, where accuracy is crucial, reliance on some erroneous information can be misleading and contribute to spreading misinformation.\nFrom an ethical perspective, there is potential misuse of ChatGPT for academic dishonesty, such as generating content for assignments or exams, raising ethical concerns (Sullivan et al., 2023; Perkins et al., 2023; Bin-Nashwan et al., 2023). Reviewing the potential of compromising academic integrity, educational institutions must establish guidelines to prevent inappropriate use. This also raises the question of the quality of CGAI training students receive without thorough learning by generating information from Al platforms with no creativity and no intellectual progress from the students (Padillah, 2023). CGAI-directed learning can impact students' quality of life, potentially affecting the future of society. Adeshola & Adepoju (2023) suggested that educational establishments can lessen the disruptive effects of this technology and uphold academic integrity by creating tests with minimal Al-generated content and through explicit regulations and guidelines.\nAnother concern raised when using ChatGPT is the inadequate handling of sensitive topics. ChatGPT may not appropriately handle sensitive or controversial topics, potentially leading to inappropriate or offensive responses (Sebastian et al., 2023, Kalla and Kuraku, 2023). The trend over the years is people's overreliance on technology (Baxter et al., 2017; Nyholm et al., 2023; Hayes et al., 2022). Depending heavily on ChatGPT's capacity to generate text can result in an overreliance on technology at the expense of human interaction, creativity, and novelty. Students may miss out on the interpersonal aspects of learning, such as mentorship, collaborative discussions, and direct interaction with instructors (Tlili et al., 2023). The missing social and emotional aspects of education can impact student engagement and motivation, hence learning quality. The use of ChatGPT involves sharing user inputs and raising concerns about data privacy and user security. Wu et al. (2023) argue that people can unintentionally become victims of CGAI misuse. Thus, everyone must learn how to protect themselves from these Chatbots. Gupta et al. (2023) and Kamalov et al. (2023) recommend stringent measures to protect sensitive student information and enforce compliance with data protection regulations."}, {"title": "4.5 Intellectual Structure of CGAI Scientific Literature", "content": "The third research objective (RO3) evaluates the intellectual structure of the scientific literature landscape of CGAI as addressed in this Section."}, {"title": "4.5.1 Citation Impact Trend Analysis", "content": "The results summary (Table 2) shows an average of 7.51 citations per document and 14,057 over the 18 years covered in this study.

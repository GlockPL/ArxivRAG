These systems can modify their internal topologies in response to new data, thereby enhancing their performance on a variety of tasks. ANNs have been particularly effective in tackling complex problems such as machine vision [1, 2], speech recognition [3, 4] and autonomous driving [5], which were previously challenging for rule-based programming methods. At the same time, machine learning can guide protein engineering efforts [6] and has recently demonstrated effectiveness in designing enzymes [7], fluorescent proteins[8, 9, 10], and optogenetic tools[11, 12].\nDespite their remarkable achievements, several challenges remain: 1. High-performing ANNs often contain an excessive number of parameters [13], which can hinder their practical deployment. 2. Training such networks demands substantial computational resources and time, a process that is becoming more costly as the improvements predicted by Moore's Law diminish [14, 15]. 3. The performance of some ANNs is highly scenario-specific, with a significant drop in efficacy when applied to different contexts [16]. These issues impact the ANNs' efficiency in terms of size, training speed, and generalization, which are critical considerations for real-world applications.\nBiological brains are a rich source of inspiration for the advancement of ANNs [17, 18]. Even the most diminutive organisms in the natural world, such as worms, fruit flies and ants, exhibit remarkable capabilities in locomotion and cognitive functions [19, 20]. The emulation of cognitive processes and paradigms from biological brains offers a promising avenue to enhance the efficacy of contemporary ANNs [21, 22].\nThe nematode C. elegans is a paradigmatic model in neurobiological research, notable for its simplicity with a nervous system comprising just 302 neurons [23]. Despite its simplicity, this primitive brain orchestrates a sophisticated array of behaviors in the worm, including perception, evasion, foraging, learning, and mating. Recent research has shown that an ANN, loosely modeled after the neural structure of C. elegans, can successfully manage the navigation of autonomous vehicles with a significantly reduced network of only 19 neurons [24, 25]. These studies have drawn from the neural information processing mechanisms of C. elegans, but they have not fully replicated the intricate interneuronal connections. Neurons, as the foundational elements of the brain, are organized topologically in a manner that is integral to the functionality and efficiency of the nervous system. Adopting the topological organization observed"}, {"title": "2 Functional neural circuits of aversive olfactory learning in C. elegans", "content": "The following procedural steps outline the behavioral experiment designed to assess the learning capabilities of C. elegans in avoiding aversive olfactory stimuli[27] (as depicted in Fig.la). The experiment initiates with two distinct cohorts of C. elegans, both reared under standard laboratory conditions. Each cohort is separately exposed to two types of bacterial strains for a period of 4 hours: the non-pathogenic Escherichia coli OP50 and the pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 [28, 29, 30]. Post-exposure, the worms from each cohort are carefully positioned at the center of a distinct culture plate. These plates are uniformly coated with the OP50 on one half and the PA14 on the other, creating a dichotomy in olfactory stimuli. The critical observation phase involves assessing the distribution of worms as they migrate towards their preferred bacterial strain. Ultimately, the experiment concludes with a quantification of the preference ratios for both OP50 and PA14 among the worms in each cohort. This analysis provides insight into the nematodes' behavioral inclinations. The results of the experiment indicate that C. elegans can develop aversive memories associated with the odor of PA14 after a 4-hour learning period, as evidenced by their preferential avoidance of the pathogenic strain [31].\nWe aim to elucidate the molecular mechanism of genes expression regulation that underlies aversive olfactory learning in C. elegans by employing high-throughput gene sequencing technology (as shown in Fig.1b). The core concept of this technology is based on the transcription of a single gene in DNA into S RNA molecules, which are then translated into S\u00d7N proteins, with N representing a fixed constant. The level of gene expression is thus represented by S. We have quantified the gene expression levels in both the control and learning cohorts as illustrated in Fig.la. Comparative analysis of gene expression between the two cohorts has led to the identification of 338 genes exhibiting differential expression, where positive values signify upregulation and negative values denote downregulation, as depicted in Fig.1c. However, the initial results did not pinpoint the specific neurons accountable for these expression varia-tions. Prior studies have established the expression patterns of these 338 genes across individual neurons in naive C. elegans, with Fig.ld providing a graphical represen-tation of select examples. A plausible inference is that the 338 genes expression will undergo changes in all neurons expressing it proportionate to its expression in naive C. elegans during aversive olfactory learning. To measure the activity of neurons in relation to aversive olfactory learning, we introduce the correlation index (CRI). The formula for calculating CRI is as follows:\n$CRI_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (W_{ji} \\times |M_j|).$\nHere, $CRI_i$ represents the correlation index for neuron i, $W_{ji}$ is the expression pro-portion of gene j in neuron i within naive C. elegans, $M_j$ is the fold change in gene expression for gene j and N is the total number of genes that displayed differential expression following a 4-hour learning period. The CRIs for 121 functional neurons were computed independently, with the results summarized in Table.1. Employing sta-tistical analysis on the CRIs of all listed functional neurons from Table.1, we have identified 11 functional neurons with a robust correlation to aversive olfactory learn-ing in C. elegans, as presented in Fig.le. Interestingly, the majority of the 11 identified functional neurons are sensory neurons, with the remainder being one interneuron and one motor neuron.\nThe neural information flow within the C. elegans brain originates from sensory neurons, subsequently traverses through interneurons and ultimately culminates at motor neurons. Following the sequence of this neural information flow, we have con-structed the biological neural network of C. elegans, as depicted in Fig.1f. In this network representation, sensory neurons are positioned in the upper layer, followed by interneurons in the middle layer and motor neurons in the lower layer. The inten-sity of the color within each functional neuron correlates with the magnitude of the CRI, providing a visual representation of their respective activities in the context of"}, {"title": "3 Artificial neural networks for image classification", "content": "Image classification stands as a central task within the field of computer vision, aim-ing to differentiate between various categories of images based on their distinctive features. Mathematically framed, it involves the discovery of a function capable of mapping the pixel intensities of an image to a specific class label. Humans, endowed with extensive prior knowledge, can effortlessly categorize images subconsciously. In contrast, for computers, discerning image categories from mere pixel values is a non-trivial challenge. Prior to the deep learning revolution, image classification often reliedon machine learning models that utilized manually crafted features, a process heav-ily dependent on expertise and iterative experimentation. The emergence of deep learning has significantly alleviated the need for manual feature engineering. Artificial neural networks, particularly those with a vast number of parameters, are now c\u0430\u0440\u0430-ble of autonomously extracting features and classifying images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)[33], which form the backbone of most contemporary image classi-fication models, draw inspiration from the mechanisms of human visual processing. Unlike traditional fully connected neural networks, CNNs employ convolution opera-tions to capture local features within the input data. Through training, these networks are able to automatically optimize the parameters of the convolutions applied. By stacking multiple CNN layers and refining their interplay, the precision of image clas-sification can be significantly enhanced. Sequential combinatorial architectures, such as the foundational LeNet, are among the most widely adopted CNN frameworks for image classification.\nIdentifying the optimal assembly of modules to construct an ANN for image clas-sification is a challenging task. The neural circuits of the C. elegans have undergone evolutionary optimization, exhibiting a topological organization that enhances the processing of neural information. Drawing inspiration from the functional neural cir-cuit's topological organization illustrated in Fig.2d, we have designed an ANN tailored for image classification, as presented in Fig.3a. To highlight the benefits of the topo-logical design depicted in Fig.3a, we constructed a comparative network Fig.3b. This comparison ANN features a randomized functional neural circuits module. Notably, this randomization is performed while maintaining an equal number of functional neu-rons and synaptic connections to those found in the original network. Furthermore, as a second point of comparison, we developed a sequential combinatorial ANN for image classification Fig.3c. This network was designed by referencing the foundational architecture of LeNet, a well-established image classification CNN model.\nThe topological organization inherent in the functional neural circuits module is intricate and substantially divergent from the linear, sequential combinations com-monly found in traditional neural network architectures. This complexity, as seen in the networks presented in Fig.3a and Fig.3b, is postulated to enhance the potential for improved accuracy in image classification tasks. The intricate interplay of connections within the network allows for a more nuanced and potentially powerful representation of the data, which can be crucial for the classification of images. Moreover, the three varieties of artificial neural networks for image classification showcased in Fig.3 offer the flexibility to produce models with varying numbers of parameters. This flexibil-ity is achieved by modulating the count of convolutional kernels denoted by c. It is well-established that models with different parameter counts, which directly influence the capacity of the network, can exhibit divergent levels of accuracy when classifying images. The balance between the number of parameters and the complexity of the model is a critical factor in achieving optimal performance, as it affects the network's ability to generalize from training data to unseen images without overfitting."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Our models underwent rigorous validation using a multitude of public datasets, as enumerated in Table.2. This validation process was designed to assess three critical aspects of performance:\n1. The overall accuracy of classification across all represented categories.\n2. The uniformity or consistency in classification accuracy among the various cate-gories.\n3. The rate at which the classification loss converges across all categories, indicative of the model's learning efficiency.\nFig.4(a-d) present the classification accuracy of three distinct ANN models for image classification across various datasets. On simpler datasets such as MNIST and FashionMNIST, the image classification ANN models, regardless of their architectures, demonstrate comparable accuracies. This pattern shifts with more complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, where image classification ANN models drawing inspi-ration from the neural circuits of aversive olfactory learning in C. elegans excel. These are closely followed by image classification models based on randomized neural circuits, both surpassing the performance of sequential image classification ANN models akin to LeNet in terms of accuracy. Fig.4(e-h) examines the classification consistency across different categories for these models. Here, the sequential image classification mod-els exhibit the least consistency, whereas the image classification models inspired by nematode neural circuits and those inspired randomized neural circuits show compa-rable levels of consistency. Additionally, the convergence speed, as shown in Fig.4(i-1), is consistent with the pattern of classification accuracy.\nThe outcomes, as depicted in Fig.4, reveal that the ANN for image classification, which draws inspiration from the aversive olfactory learning circuits of C. elegans, exhibits a notable advantage. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced when the models are tasked with more complex image classification challenges."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion and discussion", "content": "The research presented in this paper explores the potential of bio-inspired design in the development of ANNs for image classification.

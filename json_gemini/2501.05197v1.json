Achieving health equity is believed to improve the well-being of communities, reduce healthcare costs, and increase productivity and longevity. However, disparities in health are still significant. In this context, the new era of large-scale data collection and analysis presents an opportunity for diagnosing and understanding the causes of health inequities. In this study, we describe a framework for systematically analyzing health disparities using tools of causal inference. We illustrate the framework by investigating racial and ethnic disparities in intensive care unit (ICU) outcome between majority and minority groups in Australia (Indigenous vs. Non-Indigenous) and the United States (African-American vs. White). We demonstrate that commonly used statistical measures for quantifying inequity are insufficient, and focus on attributing the observed disparity to the causal mechanisms that generate it. We find that minority patients are younger at admission, have worse chronic health, are more likely to be admitted for urgent and non-elective reasons, and have higher illness severity. At the same time, however, we also find a protective direct effect of belonging to a minority group, with minority patients showing improved survival compared to their majority counterparts, with all other variables being equal. We then demonstrate that this protective effect is related to the increased probability of being admitted to ICU, with minority patients having an increased risk of ICU admission. Additionally, we also find that minority patients, while showing improved survival, are in fact more likely to be readmitted to ICU. These findings support the hypothesis that, due to worse access to primary health care, minority patients are more likely to end up in ICU for preventable conditions, causing a reduction in the mortality rates and creating an effect that appears to be protective. Since the baseline risk of ICU admission may serve as proxy for lack of access to primary care, we developed the Indigenous Intensive Care Equity (IICE) Radar, a monitoring system for tracking the over-utilization of ICU resources by the Indigenous population of Australia across geographical areas.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Health equity is defined as the state in which everyone has a fair and just opportunity to attain their highest level of health (Braveman et al, 2017). One of the key goals in pursuing health equity is the elimination of economic, social, and other obstacles to health and health care, together with eliminating existing, preventable differences in health (Braveman, 2014). The goal is to reduce preventable illnesses and deaths, improve the overall well-being of communities, and create a more inclusive healthcare system that serves everyone effectively (Braveman et al, 2011). Despite a commitment of public health organizations and government agencies to address issues of health equity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2024; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), 2024b,a; World Health Organization (WHO), 2024; European Union (EU), 2024; Healthy People 2030, 2023), health disparities are still large (Commonwealth Fund, 2023; Dwyer-Lindgren et al, 2022; Health, 2023), and many consider the solutions to health inequities to be in their early stages.\nIn this context, the rise of the new generation of computational tools and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) (Evans, 2016) offer a major opportunity to quantify and under-stand health disparities. This task is even more important due to a broad transition to using artificial intelligence (AI) tools in healthcare, which may perpetuate or amplify existing biases. In fact, recent works demonstrate formally that understanding disparities in human decision-making is an essential step for understanding disparities in automated AI systems (Ple\u010dko and Bareinboim, 2024). Therefore, a successful transition to healthcare systems that benefit from the numerous advantages of AI requires careful scrutiny of the data that is given to such AI systems for training, which includes understanding and quantifying the biases in the data itself. In this paper, we demonstrate that significant disparities in health exist in the data even before applying AI tools. Thus, training AI systems using such biased data may lead to further biases, if not handled appropriately (Plecko and Bareinboim, 2024). At the same time, while great care needs to be taken when training AI systems, a transition to such systems also presents the opportunity to possibly correct for existing human biases.\nSo far, a systematic framework for analyzing health equity that is compatible with the new needs of the data-driven era has not been proposed. In this paper, we discuss such a framework that may appeal to a broad range of practitioners, data scientists, and AI engineers. The main aim of the framework is to use a causal lens to obtain actionable insights that can improve patient engagement and outcomes. To illustrate this, we perform a case study and focus on the question of racial and ethnic disparities in outcome following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) (McGowan et al, 2022), in particular focusing on disparities in mortality. We analyze data from Australia (Secombe et al, 2023) for disparities between the Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) and Non-Indigenous (majority group) population of Australia. In parallel, we also analyze a database from a large tertiary hospital in Boston, Massachusetts (Johnson et al, 2020), focusing on the racial disparity between the African-American and White population. We illustrate how a systematic approach for analyzing equity can illuminate different causal mechanisms that generate disparities observed in the data, and demonstrate that racial/ethnic disparities in ICU outcome are markedly similar between the United States and Australia."}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "The research in this paper was approved by the ethics committee of the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne (Project #661/24), and was done in collaboration with the Indigenous Data Network (IDN) of Australia (Indigenous Data Network, 2024b)."}, {"title": "2.1 Data", "content": "The first dataset we analyzed is the Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) Intensive Care Society (ANZ-ICS) Adult Patient Database (APD) (Secombe et al, 2023).

Using the ricu R-package (Bennett et al, 2023), we performed data loading for both datasets, which includes infor-mation on race (MIMIC-IV) or ethnicity (ANZICS APD), age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES for short, available in ANZICS APD only), chronic health status, admission diagnosis, illness severity, and in-hospital mortality. Based on domain knowledge, we constructed a specific type of causal diagram called the Standard Fairness Model (SFM), in which variables are categorized into four groups. The protected attribute is race/ethnicity (depending on the dataset), labeled X. The set of confounders, labeled Z, includes age, sex, and SES (SES was available only in Australian data). These demographic variables were chosen as confounders since they may be correlated with race/ethnicity but may not necessarily be causally influenced by it. The set of mediators W includes chronic health sta-tus, admission diagnosis, and illness severity. The outcome of interest is in-hospital mortality, labeled Y. A comparison of patient characteristics for majority and minority groups for the ANZICS APD and MIMIC-IV cohorts is given in Tbls. A1 and A2, respectively.\nOur goal in this paper was to explain the observed disparity in mortality between the demographic groups. We started by computing the average differences in mortality rates (also known as the total variation, or TV measure), a commonly used measure of disparity, and found that\n(AU) E[death | Non-Indigenous] - E[death | Indigenous] = -0.4%, (1)\n(US) E[death | White] - E[death | African-American] = 0.8%. (2)\nThese statistics show that minority patients in Australia were more likely to die after ICU admission, while this finding is reversed in the US data. Based on the constructed causal diagram from Fig. 2a, however, we see that the average difference in mortality rates as in Eqs. 1-2 can arise in three different ways:\n(i) confounded/spurious effect: race/ethnicity may be associated with age, sex, or socioeconomic status, which may influence the mortality risk,\n(ii) indirect effect: race/ethnicity may influence chronic health, admission diagnosis, and illness severity, which have an effect on the mortality risk,\n(iii) direct effect: race/ethnicity may influence the mortality risk, with all other variables kept equal.\nUsing the framework of causal fairness analysis, we can compute the above three effects, and quantify how much each of the effects contributes to the marginal disparity reported in Eqs. 1-2."}, {"title": "2.3 Decomposing the Disparity", "content": "The results quantifying confounded, indirect, and direct effects on both datasets are shown in Fig. 2b. The TV measure, reported in Eqs. 1-2 and shown in the last column of Fig. 2b, takes opposite signs on the two datasets. However, when applying a causal perspective on the problem, we obtain the following decomposition of the TV measure:\n(AU) E[death | Non-Indigenous] \u2013 E[death | Indigenous] = -0.4% = 1.8% +(-2.7%)+0.5%, (3)\n(US) E[death | White] - E[death | African-American] = 0.8% = 1.1% +(-1.3%)+1.0%. (4)\nWe see that the direct, indirect, and spurious effects (first three columns in Fig. 2b) are in fact equal in sign when applying the causal decomposition. The causal interpretation of the decomposition can be summarized as follows. First, along the confounded causal pathway, there exists a protective effect for minority patients, transmitted through variables such as age, sex, or SES (accounting for 1.8% and 1.1% of the overall variation in the AU and US data, respectively). Second, along the indirect causal path, there is a harmful effect on minority patients, indicating that minority patients are more likely to die as a result of the indirect effect (accounting for negative 2.7% and 1.3% of the overall variation, respectively). Variables that transmit the indirect effect include chronic health status, admission diagnosis, and the degree of illness severity. Third, along the direct causal path (when keeping all other variables equal), there is a protective effect of belonging to the minority group, which accounted for 0.5% of the overall variation in the AU data, and 1.0% in the US data. In other words, for two individuals with comparable characteristics (age, chronic health, illness severity, admission diagnosis) who differ with respect to the protected attribute, the one belonging to the minority group is more likely to survive after ICU admission. Finally, we emphasize that all the effects studied were statistically significant, indicating that the average differences between groups are in fact a complex interplay of multiple causal mechanisms that transmit change between these demographics.\nExplaining the confounded effect. The confounding variables between the protected attribute ethnicity/race and the outcome are age, sex, and SES (see Fig. 2a). We therefore analyzed the age/sex distributions of different subpopulations. In both datasets, minority patients were admitted much younger on average compared to their majority counterparts (average difference in age of 13.6 years in Australian, and 6.3 years in US data). The age distributions for the two countries, across minority and majority groups, are shown in Figs. 3a, 3b. Further, we found differences in socioeconomic status in the Australian data (see Fig. 3c). Indigenous patients have lower SES on average, which increases the mortality risk. Since younger age and higher SES reduce the mortality risk, the group-specific differences in age/SES are both relevant for understanding the confounded effect in the first column of Fig. 2b.\nExplaining the indirect effect. The indirect effect, reported in the second column of Fig. 2b, is protective for the majority group. This effect is mediated by admission diagnosis, illness severity, and chronic health status. Therefore, we compared group-specific distributions of illness severity after adjusting for age. In Australia, minority patients had higher illness severity (Fig. 3d, p < 0.001 for difference in means), while the distribution of illness severity in the US data did not show a clear trend (Fig. 3e, p = 0.30 for difference in means). We also analyzed differential patterns in admission diagnosis after adjusting for age. Minority patients were more likely to be admitted for a medical vs. a surgical reason (both p < 0.001) and were more likely to be a non-elective admission (both p < 0.001). This mechanism also explains a part of the observed indirect effect, since medical and non-elective admissions carry a greater risk of death. Furthermore, in the US data, minority patients had a higher average Charlson comorbidity index (Charlson et al, 1987) (Fig. 3f, p < 0.001), while in the Australian data, minority patients scored higher on the Clinical Frailty Scale (Rockwood et al, 2005) (p < 0.001). Therefore, worse pre-morbid health status also contributed to the indirect effect. In summary, the indirect effect is explained through a combination of differences in admission pattern, chronic health status, and illness severity.\nExplaining the direct effect. In both datasets, the direct effect was protective for minority patients when all other variables were kept equal. This finding required an extended analysis, which is described next. First, we note that possible unobserved confounders for the direct effect of race/ethnicity on outcome include variables such the SES (measured only in AU data) or other unobserved social deter-minants of health (SDoH). However, the above analysis shows that SES (when available) indicates better status for the majority group. Thus, the addition of SES or SDoH data to the analysis would likely not explain away the protective direct effect for the minority group, but rather make it more pro-nounced. To better understand direct effects, we took a more granular approach to the quantification of such effects."}, {"title": "2.4 Interaction Testing and Heterogeneous Effects", "content": "To assess potential interactions between the causal pathways under study, we performed non-parametric interaction testing (Plecko, 2024). This approach provides statistical tests to detect interactions between causal effects along different pathways. As discussed, there are three pathways between ethnic-ity/race (X) and mortality (Y) in Fig. 2a, namely confounded, indirect, and direct. Using interaction testing, for each pair of pathways, we tested if their interaction was significant. In both datasets, we identified significant interactions between (i) indirect and confounded pathways and (ii) direct and indirect pathways. In the ANZICS APD data, we additionally found significant interactions of direct and confounded pathways. The full set of p-values for interaction tests is given in Appendix B. The indirect-confounded interaction suggests that the indirect effect along $X \\rightarrow W \\rightarrow Y$ is modified by values of the confounders Z. This modification is studied in Appendix D. Similarly, the direct-indirect interaction suggests that the direct effect along $X \\rightarrow Y$ is modified by values of the mediators W."}, {"title": "2.5 Tipping Over Hypothesis and Population Risks", "content": "We hypothesized that the protective effect of race/ethnicity observed in the data was due to a tipping over effect - minority patients are more likely to require ICU care due to medical complications. The increase in the probability of requiring ICU admission may be a result of worse access to primary health care, since minority groups are less likely to have access to and utilize health care, as reported in previous literature (Davy et al, 2016). Put differently, for majority patients, medical complications are more likely to be prevented through primary care, and therefore only the more severe cases reach the ICU, causing a selection bias (or left-censoring). Following this hypothesis, we sought to investigate the baseline risk of ICU admission across different admission groups in the ANZICS APD. This analysis was possible since the ANZICS APD covers 98% of all ICU admissions in Australia. Data on the age and ethnicity structure of the Australian population were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021a,b). After computing the risks of ICU admission, we found that minority patients were 182% more likely to be admitted to ICU (compared to a majority group patient) for a medical reason, 79% more likely for emergency surgery, and 14% less likely for elective surgery (all p < 0.001).\nWe sought to investigate if the risk ratio for ICU admission was related to the strength of the observed protective direct effect for the minority group. A possible causal mechanism of the phe-nomenon may be described as follows. Larger risk ratios for ICU admission indicate that a larger number of patients were admitted for a specific diagnosis. A higher prevalence of a specific diagnosis may decrease the underlying illness severity, since ICU admissions for patients with conditions that may have been prevented at an earlier stage of care are likely to reduce the overall risk in the group. To investigate this potential explanation, we assessed the age-adjusted risk ratio of ICU admission across age groups and admission types, defined as:\n$\\frac{P(\\text{admission } d \\mid do(\\text{minority}), \\text{age group})}{P(\\text{admission } d \\mid do(\\text{majority}), \\text{age group})}$ (5)\nThe larger the ratio, the more likely minority patients are to be admitted for this diagnosis and age group, compared to majority patients. The risk ratios across age groups and admission types are presented in Fig. 4b. We tested the similarity of the risk ratios in Fig. 4b with the estimates of the direct effect of minority status on mortality in Fig. 4a. These effects were significantly correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient p = 0.45 with 95% confidence interval [0.22,0.68]). Therefore, the pattern of increased risk of ICU admission appeared to be related to the protective effect of minority status on mortality for different age-diagnosis groups. Logically, however, other unknown factors (such as baseline disease incidence) would provide further insight into this analysis."}, {"title": "2.6 Readmission Analysis", "content": "After examining the patterns of protective direct effects on mortality, and baseline risk of ICU admis-sion, we further investigated the risk of ICU readmission. Within the cohort of patients who survived their hospital stay, we analyzed whether the patient was readmitted to ICU after being released from the hospital, and this readmission outcome was labeled R (in the Australian data, readmission to any hospital in the database was considered, while in the US data only readmission to the same hospital was available). Using the same quantitative approach as in Sec. 2.2, and the same causal model in Fig. 2a with readmission R replacing the mortality outcome Y, we estimated the direct effect of minor-ity status on readmission (along the direct $X \\rightarrow R$ pathway). The values of this direct effect along different age-admission groups are shown in Fig. 4c for ANZICS APD and in Fig. 4e for MIMIC-IV. Here, the red color indicates an increased risk of readmission for minority patients compared to their majority group counterparts. In both datasets, minority patients were more likely to be readmitted, with a stronger pattern in the US data. In both countries, the increase in readmission had significant similarity with the protective direct effect pattern for mortality (p = 0.74 with 95% CI [0.53, 0.94] for Australia, comparing Figs. 4a, 4c; p = 0.81 with 95% CI [0.58, 1] for the US, comparing Figs. 4d, 4e).

At the same time, the higher likelihood of Indigenous patients (i) being admitted to the ICU and (ii) being readmitted to the ICU, together with the significant correlation between these patterns and the protective effect on mortality, suggests that these patterns may be jointly explained by limited access to or under-utilization of primary care by the minority group. Based on this, we hypothesized that the increase in the baseline risk of ICU admission should be investigated as a proxy variable for the under-utilization of primary care by Indigenous patients. This motivated the construction of the Indigenous Intensive Care Equity (IICE) Radar. From the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b), we extracted data about age and Indigenous status across different geographical areas of Australia. We then matched areas with the patient information available in the ANZICS APD, to compute the age-adjusted baseline risk ratio of ICU admission, i.e., how much more likely minority patients were to be admitted to ICU depending on the area (our analysis was performed on the level of Statistical Areas 3 used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the year 2021). The IICE Radar is shown in Fig. 5, with five risk categories for the different areas. Excess risk ratio of less than 10% was considered as no risk (white color). Excess RR of 10-50% was classified as moderate risk (light pink), 50-100% as substantial (light red), 100-200% as severe (red), and >200% as extreme (black).Many of the statistical areas experienced at least moderate risk, implying Indigenous patients were 50% to a 100% more likely to be admitted to ICU. Some parts of Western Australia (South West - Perth) recorded excess risk ratios of more than 300% (minority patients were four times more likely to be admitted), while in other parts (Outback North) the excess risk was up to 900% (minority patients were ten times more likely to be admitted to ICU). The IICE Radar uncovers substantial differences in risk of ICU admission across different regions, requiring further investigation. The construction of the Radar opens the door to monitoring the increase in admission to ICU, and future studies of access to primary care and its impact on health outcomes of minority groups."}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Dataset Description and Covariates", "content": "The ANZICS APD contains information on demographics (including age, sex, Indigenous status), biochemical and physiological values during the first 24 hours of the ICU stay, and ICU admission diagnosis (ANZICS modification of the APACHE IV diagnosis list).

Our approach of analyzing and aggregating findings across multiple data sources is also related to the data-fusion paradigm in the causal inference literature (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). An SCM is a tuple $M := (V, U, F, P(u))$, where $V, U$ are sets of endogenous (observable) and exogenous (latent) variables, respectively, $F$ is a set of functions $f_v$, one for each $V_i \\in V$, where $V_i \\leftarrow f_v; (pa(V_i), U_{v_i})$ for some $pa(V_i) \\subseteq V$ and $U_{v_i} \\subseteq U$. $P(u)$ is a strictly positive probability measure over $U$. Each SCM $M$ is associated to a causal diagram $G$ (Bareinboim et al, 2022) over the node set $V$ where an edge $V \\rightarrow V_i$ exists if $V_i$ is an argument of $f_{v_i}$, and a bidirected edge $V_i \\leftrightarrow V_j$ exists if the corresponding $U_{v_i}, U_{v_j}$ are not independent. An instantiation of the exogenous variables $U = u$ is called a unit. By $Y_x(u)$ we denote the potential outcome of $Y$ when setting $X = x$ for the unit $u$, which is the solution for $Y(u)$ to the set of equations obtained by evaluating the unit $u$ in the submodel $M_x$, in which all equations in $F$ associated with $X$ are replaced by $X = x$. Throughout the paper, we use a specific cluster causal diagram GSFM known as the standard fairness model (SFM) (Ple\u010dko and Bareinboim, 2024) over endogenous variables $\\{X, Z, W, Y\\}$, shown in Fig. 2a, representing the protected attribute, confounders, mediators, and the outcome, respectively.\nOur key goal is to decompose the average difference in mortality rates between majority and minority groups, as given in Eq. 1-2. The average difference in mortality, written $E[Y | X = x_1]-E[Y | X = x_0]$, where $Y$ is the outcome, $x_1$ the majority group, $x_0$ minority, can be decomposed as (Zhang and Bareinboim, 2018; Ple\u010dko and Bareinboim, 2024):\n$E[Y | X = x_1] - E[Y | X = x_0] = E[Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} - Y_{x_0} | X = x_0]$ (direct)\n$- E[Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} - Y_{x_1} | X = x_0]$ (indirect)\n$- E[Y_{x_1} | X = x_0] - E[Y_{x_1} | X = x_1]$. (confounded)\n(6)\nThe difference $E[Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} - Y_{x_0} | X = x_0]$ captures the effect of changing X from minority group $x_0$ to majority group $x_1$ along the direct causal pathway while keeping the mediators at their natural level $W_{x_0}$, averaged across all minority patients (represented by the conditioning $X = x_0$ in the expectation). The difference $E[Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} - Y_{x_1} | X = x_0]$ captures the effect of changing X from majority group $x_1$ to minority group $x_0$ along the indirect causal pathway while keeping X = $x_1$ along the direct causal path, average across individuals. For the indirect effect, we considered the reverse transition of changing $x_1 \\rightarrow x_0$ (as opposed to $x_0 \\rightarrow x_1$ for the direct effect), and this difference was subtracted from the direct effect quantity. Finally, the confounded term $E[Y_{x_1} | X = x_0] - E[Y_{x_1} | X = x_1]$ compares the effect of setting X = $x_1$ along direct and indirect pathways for the minority group $x_0$ vs. the majority group $x_1$. The marginal difference $E[Y | X = x_1] \u2013 E[Y | X = x_0]$ is obtained by subtracting the above-described quantifications of indirect and confounded effects from the quantification of the direct effect as shown in Eq. 6. In Eqs. 3-4 we report the $x-DE_{x_0,x_1} (y | x_0)$ effect, and the negative of indirect, and confounded effects, $-x-IE_{x_1,x_0} (y | x_0)$ and $-x-CE_{x_1,x_0} (y)$, respectively.

The reason why a reverse transition needs to be considered is the possible existence of interactions, as noted by (VanderWeele, 2015). Following (Plecko, 2024), an absence of an interaction would imply that the structural mechanism $f_Y$ of $Y$ can be written as:\n$f_Y(x, z, w, u_Y) = f_Y^{(1)} (x, y) + f_Y^{(2)} (w, U_Y) + f_Y^{(3)} (z, U_Y)$, (8)\nwhere $f_Y^{(1)}, f_Y^{(2)}$, and $f_Y^{(3)}$ are the structural functions corresponding to effects of covariates X, W, and Z, respectively. For binary outcomes, the absence of interactions is considered on the risk-scale, meaning that the structural mechanism $f_Y$ which returns a binary value is replaced by $p_Y(x, z, w) = P(f_Y(x,z,w, U_Y) = 1)$. For the binary case, the absence of any interactions would be written as this would be given by the condition:\n$p_Y(x, z, w) := P(f_Y(x, z, w, U_Y) = 1) = p_Y^{(1)} (x) + p_Y^{(2)} (w) + p_Y^{(3)} (z)$, (9)\nwhere $p^{(i)}$ are different functions.

The obtained p-values for each interaction are provided in Appendix B. For quantifying heterogeneous effects, we considered four different age groups $C_1,..., C_4$, corresponding to 18-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75-100 years of age. These groups were chosen as approximate quartiles of age in the data. For admission categories, we considered three admission types, namely medical admissions $d_{med}$, emergency surgery admissions $d_{ems}$, and elective surgery admissions $d_{els}$. For investigating heterogeneity of direct effects, we computed the quantity\n$DE_{x_0,x_1} (y | C_i, d, x_0) = E[Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} - Y_{x_0, W_0} | \\text{age} \\in C_i, \\text{admission} = d, X = x_0]$ (13)\nfor different values of $C_i, d$ (reported in Fig. 4). For heterogeneity of indirect effects, we investigated the quantity\n$-IE_{x_1,x_0} (y | \\text{age} \\in C_i, x_0) = E[Y_{x_1,W_{\\bar{x}_1}} - Y_{x_1,W_{x_0}} | \\text{age} \\in C_i, X = x_0]$ (14)\nfor different values of $C_i$ (see Appendix D). The effects $DE_{x_0,x_1}(y | C_i,d, x_0)$ and $IE_{x_1,x_0} (y | C_i, x_0)$ were estimated using causal forests (Wager and Athey, 2018), while the uncertainty estimates were obtained using bootstrap."}, {"title": "3.4 Tipping Over Hypothesis and Population Risks", "content": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides census-based values of population in each age group for years 2016, 2021 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2021b).

However, existing approaches struggle with limitations in insufficient annotations and suboptimal architecture design. For instance, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-squashing, causing the loss of important structural details in molecules, thus impairing molecular representations. In this work, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-MoIKAN and its augmented variant, GNN-MolKAN+, that integrate the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architecture from AI + Science into GNNs to address these challenges. Additionally, we introduce Adaptive FastKAN (AdFastKAN), an advanced KAN that offers increased stability and speed, further enhancing the performance of standard GNNs. Notably, our approach holds three key benefits: 1) Superior Performance: GNN-MolKAN and GNN-MolKAN+ demonstrate superior prediction ability, robust generalization to unseen scaffolds, and versatile transferability across different GNN architectures. 2) Efficiency: These models require less computational time and fewer parameters while matching or surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised methods. 3) Few-shot Learning Ability: GNN-MolKAN demonstrates great potential in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 6.97% across few-shot benchmarks. Overall, we validate our architecture on 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot learning datasets, consistently achieving highly competitive results across all of them.", "sections": [{"title": "Existing methods and their limitations", "content": "Accurately predicting the physicochemical properties of molecules (Livingstone 2000; Li et al. 2022), drug activities (Datta and Grant 2004; Sadybekov and Katritch 2023), and material characteristics (Pilania 2021; Jablonka et al. 2024) is essential for advancing drug discovery and material science. Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in achieving these accurate predictions (Fang et al. 2022). Existing approaches to molecular representation learning can be broadly classified into two categories: Transformer-based approaches (Fabian et al. 2020; Chithrananda, Grand, and Ramsundar 2020; Rong et al. 2020; Y\u00fcksel et al. 2023), GNN-based approaches (Wieder et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2022; Fang et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2021; Hou et al. 2022).\nTransformer-based Methods. The success of Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP, Vaswani et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2020; Touvron et al. 2023) and computer vision (CV, Dosovitskiy et al. 2021; Ramesh et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2024a) has spurred their application in drug discovery (Chowdhury et al. 2022; Madani et al. 2023; Y\u00fcksel et al. 2023). Notable efforts, such as MolBERT (Fabian et al. 2020), ChemBERTa (Chithrananda, Grand, and Ramsundar 2020), and its advanced version ChemBERTa-2 (Ahmad et al. 2022), enhance molecular representations by integrating BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) with SMILES (Weininger 1988). Furthermore, SELFIES offers a robust alternative to SMILES (Krenn et al. 2020), with models like SELFormer (Y\u00fcksel et al. 2023) and MolGen (Fang et al. 2024) demonstrating outstanding performance. However, despite their advancements, Transformer-based approaches are still constrained by the quadratic complexity bottleneck, where computational demands increase rapidly with input size due to the self-attention mechanism.\nGNN-based Methods. Mainstream GNN-based methods utilize the topological structure of molecules, representing atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. Most approaches rely on the message-passing mechanism (Gilmer et al. 2020). Prominent methods in this category include Graph Convolutional Network (GCN, Kipf and Welling 2017), Graph Attention Network (GAT, Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al. 2018), and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN, Xu et al. 2018). Extended approaches like MolCLR (Wang et al. 2022) and KANO (Fang et al. 2023) use contrastive learning framework, while MGSSL (Zhang et al. 2021) and GraphMAE (Hou et al. 2022) employ generative pre-training strategies to learn comprehensive molecular representations. However, these methods face the challenge of over-squashing, which leads to poor long-range dependencies. Information from distant atoms is overly compressed as it passes through the network, resulting in a loss of important molecular structural details.\nCombination of Both: Graph Transformer. Several works have adapted the Transformer architecture to address the issue of long-range dependencies in GNNs. Notably, Graphormer (Ying et al. 2021), GPS(Ramp\u00e1\u0161ek et al. 2022), Grover(Rong et al. 2020), and Uni-Mol (Zhou et al. 2023) integrate message-passing networks into the Transformer architecture to enhance their expressive power. However, like other Transformer-based methods, Graph Transformer methods also suffer from high computational complexity."}, {"title": "Generalizing KAN to Molecular Graphs", "content": "In molecular representation learning, challenges arise from the scarcity and diversity of data. Given the crucial role of molecular structure, we focus on graph-based methods, which are hampered by the structural issues of over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies. Considering KAN is suitable for efficiently handling small-scale tasks with limited annotations, we introduce it in molecular representation learning to solve these challenges. The efficient fitting mechanisms of KAN can alleviate the structural deficiencies of GNN-based methods. Additionally, we propose a KAN variant, Adaptive FastKAN, which can enhance the adaptability of model to diverse data distributions.\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). Liu et al. (2024b) introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a new type of network inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem (KART, Arnold 2009; Kolmogorov 1957). KART allows the decomposition of complex multivariate functions into simpler single-variable components, facilitating more efficient computation. Unlike Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs, Cybenko 1989; Hornik, Stinchcombe, and White 1989), which have fixed activation functions on nodes (\"neurons\"), KAN features learnable activation functions on edges (\"weights\"), parametrized as splines. This unique design improves accuracy, making KAN more efficient than MLPs in small-scale AI + Science tasks. For instance, when solving partial differential equations (PDEs), a two-layer KAN with a width of 10 achieves accuracy 100 times greater than a four-layer MLP with a width of 100 (Liu et al. 2024b). Additionally, the exceptional accuracy of KAN extends beyond PDE solving, demonstrating notable success in image recognition (Azam and Akhtar 2024), image generation (Li et al. 2024) and time series prediction tasks (Vaca-Rubio et al. 2024; Xu, Chen, and Wang 2024). To summarize, the most significant advantage of KAN is its ability to surpass SOTAs with minimal parameters, making it ideal for small-scale tasks.\nThe Benefits of Generalizing KAN to Molecular Graphs. Generalizing KAN to molecular graphs alleviates the issue of over-squashing in GNNs by utilizing its efficient fitting capabilities and high accuracy. This enhancement improves the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, thereby retaining and utilizing crucial structures more effectively. Furthermore, KAN's efficient use of parameters allows it to outperform or match the SOTAs even with limited labeled data, making it ideal for small-scale molecular representation tasks (Figure 1). However, generalizing KAN to molecular graphs poses significant challenges. A detailed discussion of these challenges is provided in Section ."}, {"title": "Contributions", "content": "Our contributions are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We integrate the efficient parameter usage and powerful data-fitting capabilities of KAN architecture with GNNs, which can overcome the limitations of insufficient annotations and suboptimal architecture design.\n\u2022 We propose the Adaptable FastKAN (AdFastKAN), which introduces the learnable RBFs as base function. This modification not only effectively addresses the slow speed of the original KAN but also significantly enhances the model's adaptability to diverse data distributions.\n\u2022 Our GNN-MolKAN demonstrates exceptional predictive power and robust generalization ability on molecular property prediction datasets, while also requiring less time and memory to surpass or match the SOTAS.\n\u2022 We validate the effectiveness of our model in solving few-shot learning problem on few-shot benchmarks. Our augmented models achieve an average improvement of 6.97% across four datasets."}, {"title": "Generalization Challenges", "content": "How to Use KAN to Handle Non-Euclidean Molecular Graphs? One notable geometric characteristic that distinguishes molecular graphs from conventional structured data is their irregularity: the number of nodes and edges varies between them. Despite KAN's exceptional performance on Euclidean data, its original design limits its direct application to graph-structured data. To overcome this limitation, we combine the powerful approximation capabilities of KAN with the structural advantages of GNNs. Specifically, we utilize GNNs to transform molecular graphs into high-dimensional representations in Euclidean space and employ aggregation functions to combine these node representations. Subsequently, KAN serves as the update function, using learnable activation functions to accommodate the varying importance of different nodes. This flexible adjustment of node representations allows the model to better adapt to diverse datasets and tasks.\nHow to Address Slow Computation Speeds in KAN? Despite the power of KAN, integrating B-splines (Unser, Aldroubi, and Eden 1993) in its learnable activation functions increases computational complexity, leading to longer training time due to the calculation of piecewise polynomials (Liu et al. 2024b). To improve training efficiency, previous works have replaced B-splines with simpler base functions (Li 2024; Ta 2024; Qiu et al. 2024). Inspired by FastKAN (Li 2024), we adopt RBFs (Tao 1993; Orr et al. 1996) to replace B-splines due to their simple formula and lower memory overhead, thereby accelerating the computational speed of the model. However, the fixed centers and bandwidths in RBFs may not adapt well to the data distribution. The small bandwidth causes the RBFs function to respond very locally, leading to overfitting, while the large bandwidth results in overly smooth responses, causing underfitting. Both issues can degrade the model's performance (Tenne 2022).\nHow to Enhance the Adaptability of RBFs to Data Distribution? Unlike prior works (Tao 1993; Orr et al. 1996) that employ fixed bandwidth and centers, we introduce Adaptive FastKAN (AdFastKAN), which parameterizes the bandwidths and centers of RBFs. This parameterization allows our model to dynamically adapt to the different data distributions, enhancing its flexibility. The parameterized RBFs can adjust their shape and position more effectively, increasing the model's representational power. This helps overcome the bottlenecks of GNNs and efficiently capture complex molecular structures. Additionally, the dynamic adaptation of bandwidths and centers accelerates the convergence of the model and helps find the global optimum. To further enhance adaptability to complex data patterns, we replace the original classifier (i.e., MLPs) in GNN-MolKAN with AdFastKAN. The resulting architecture is called GNN-MoIKAN+."}, {"title": "GNN-MolKAN Architecture", "content": "The framework of GNN-MolKAN is illustrated in Figure 2. This section focuses on the implementation details of the network architecture. These details are crucial for ensuring the speed and reliability of the network.\nNotation. Let $G = (V, E)$ be a molecular graph, where $V$ represents the set of nodes and $E$ represents the set of edges. The number of nodes is $N = |V|$. The features of node $v_i$ are represented by $h_i$. The features of the edge between nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ are represented by $b_{ij}$. Let $z$ be the graph-level representation, $\\hat{y}$ be the graph-level prediction and $y$ be the molecular property label (i.e., the ground-truth label).\nPreliminary\nKolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (Arnold 2009; Kolmogorov 1957; Braun and Griebel 2009) states that any multivariate continuous function on a bounded domain can be expressed as a finite composition of continuous"}, {"title": "single-variable functions and addition operations.

Within this, the inner one sums $n$ terms for each q, where each term $\\varphi_{q,p}: [0,1] \\rightarrow R$ represents a continuous function of the single variable $x_p$.\nThe Design of KAN. Unlike the simple 2-layer KAN described by Eq. 1, which follows a $[n, 2n + 1,1]$ structure, KAN can be generalized to arbitrary widths and depths. Specifically, KAN consists of $L$ layers and generates outputs based on the input vector $x \\in R^n$:\n$KAN(x) = (\\Phi_{L-1} \\circ \\Phi_{L-2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\Phi_1 \\circ \\Phi_0) x$, (2)\nwhere $\\Phi_l$ represents the function matrix of the $l^{th}$ layer. Each layer of the KAN, defined by the function matrix $\\Phi_l$ is formed as follows:\n$x_{l+1} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\Phi_{l,1,1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{l,1,2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{l,1,n_l} (\\cdot) \\\\\n\\Phi_{l,2,1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{l,2,2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{l,2,n_l} (\\cdot) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\Phi_{l,n_{l+1},1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{l,n_{l+1},2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{l,n_{l+1},n_l} (\\cdot)\n\\end{pmatrix} x_l,$ (3)"}, {"title": "where $\\Phi_{l,j,i}$ denotes the activation function connecting neuron", "content": "$i$ in layer $l$ to neuron $j$ in layer $l+1$. The network uitilizes $n_l \\times n_{l+1}$ such activation functions between each layer.\nKAN enhances its learning capability by utilizing residual activation functions that integrate a basis function and a spline function:\n$\\phi(x) = w_b b(x) + w_s spline (x),$ (4)\nwhere $b(x)$ is the $silu(x)$ serving as the basis function, and the spline function is a linear combination of B-splines. The $w_b$ and $w_s$ are learnable parameters.\nThe Advanced Version of KAN: FastKAN. Li (2024) introduces FastKAN, a new implementation of KANs that significantly accelerate model computations. FastKAN achieves this by utilizing radial basis functions (RBFs) with Gaussian kernels instead of traditional B-spline functions. The RBF is defined as:\n$\\phi(x) = w_b b (x) + w_r exp \\left( -\\frac{||x - c||^2}{2} \\right),$ (5)\nwhere $w_r$ represents learnable parameters. In this context, $r$ is the Euclidean distance between the input $x$ and a center $c$, scaled by a parameter $k$ which controls the width of the Gaussian function:\n$r = \\frac{||x - c||}{k}$ (6)\nArchitecture\nMolecular representation learning with GNNs generally involves three steps: Aggregation, Update, and Readout operations. We propose a new class of GNNs that leverage the strengths of KAN for feature updating. To address KAN's limitations in computational efficiency and adaptability, we introduce AdFastKAN, a variant of KAN with learnable RBFs as activation functions. AdFastKAN adaptively adjusts its parameters based on the data distribution, enabling effective modeling of molecules with diverse scaffolds. By integrating AdFastKAN with GNNs, our model captures intricate molecular features more effectively, improving both computational efficiency and prediction performance."}, {"title": "Step 1: Aggregation Operation.

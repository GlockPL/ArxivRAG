Introduction", "content": "Heart Failure (HF), the condition in which the heart fails to pump blood and oxygen to the body's organs, is a significant public health concern. Approximately 6.7 million Americans over 20 years of age have HF, and the prevalence is expected to rise to 11.4 million by 2050 [1]. Nearly 25% HF patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge, causing high healthcare cost [2]. While risk factors for readmission have been predom-inantly studied in the context of medical factors such as comorbidities [3], the role of Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) (e.g. socioeconomic status and social support) has not been well studied [4]. Understanding how SDOH affect readmission among HF patients using available patient health data could provide critical insights to develop ap-propriate interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.\nA great challenge for SDOH based readmission analysis lies in SDOH being of-ten underrepresented or insufficiently captured in structured electronic health records (EHRs) or insurance claims [5]. Fortunately, unstructured clinical notes (e.g. admission notes, nursing progress notes, discharge notes) contains rich, detailed narratives that con-vey information regarding SDOH (e.g. \u201cpat live alone w/ pets\") [5, 6]. Extracting and analyzing this information is challenging due to the variability and free-text nature of clinical notes. To address this, we propose to leverage the advanced large language model (LLM), which is capable of processing and understanding domain-specific text [5], to systemically mine SDOH. We further aim to understand the association between SDOH and HF readmission by performing odds ratio analysis using logistic regression [7]. This approach allows us to quantify the relative impact of factors such as socioeconomic sta-tus, housing stability, and access to transportation on readmission likelihood. By inter-preting the odds ratios, we identify which SDOHs were most strongly associated with increased or decreased risk of readmission, providing actionable insights for targeted interventions.\""}, {"title": "2. Methods", "content": "Dataset and Cohort Selection. For our data source, we use Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) [8], a large open source healthcare database that contains information for patient hospitalized in critical care unit. We first identify HF patients through their recorded ICD-9 code: \"398.91, 402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.03, 404.11, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93\", and any code that starts with \"428\". We keep two con-secutive ICU admissions of HF patients as one data sample, and whether the admission date differences between the current and previous admission is less than 30 days is used as the prediction target. \nMultiple discharge notes can correspond to a single hospital admission due to caregivers writing multiple notes and adding addendum during the admission. Therefore, we remove dupli-cated texts and concatenate these notes together for SDOH mining. For overly lengthy combined notes, we keep mainly Social History, Physical Exam, and Medical History sections that mostly likely mention SDOHs.\nSocial Determinants of Health Mining. One primary goal of our study is to mine SDOHs from textual notes. Given a patient's (discharge) note $T = {t_1,...,t_{|T|}}$ consist of a sequences of tokens, we leverage the LLM $f_e$ to extract certain SDOH $D = {d_1,...,d_p}$ that can be either a text span from original note T or a paraphrase of the original text span. Therefore, the mining process is defined as $D = f_e (T, P_D)$, where $P_D$ denotes the SDOH specific prompt. To prompt the LLM, we use zero-shot prompting, a prompting method that instructs a language model to perform a task without providing specific examples or training data for that particular task [9]. The key advantage is that the learnable parameters of $f_e$ would not need to be updated. Instead, we utilize the checkpoint of an open source LLM, Llama-3.1-8B [10], where the 8 billion parameters @ have been pre-trained with massive amount of textual corpus including biomedical lit-erature and public clinical databases. Specifically, we use a template of prompt to mine various SDOHS:"}, {"title": "3. Results", "content": "SDOH Mining Experiments. After obtaining the mined results, we verify the charted SDOH attributes against the corresponding EHR data  and the uncharted"}, {"title": "Logistic Regression Statistical Inference.", "content": "The results of the logistic regression, high-lighting significant predictors of HF readmission, are shown in \nAge is identi-fied as a significant predictor, indicating a slight increase in the likelihood of readmis-sion with increasing age. Ethnicity, specifically when documented as \"unspecified\", is associated with a higher risk of readmission. Among insurance types, Medicare is signif-icantly associated with a markedly increased risk of readmission. Past tobacco use and transportation resource limitation are also significant predictors. Finally, social support is identified as a significant factor associated with a reduced likelihood of readmission."}, {"title": "4. Discussion", "content": "The high Spec-Acc for extracted result, especially for patient gender, marital status, al-cohol, and tobacco use, as well as the low MAE for age demonstrates the LLM's ef-fectiveness in extracting structured information from unstructured text. The significantly low Spec-Acc for other uncharted SDOH is likely due to the human-annotated dataset containing very few instances available for verification. Additionally, these instances rep-resent a small proportion of the entire cohort. Consequently, the low accuracy may not accurately reflect the true performance of the LLM.\nLogistic regression analysis further highlights key factors influencing 30-day read-mission. Older individuals face a higher risk of readmission, aligning with prior stud-ies [11] that underscore the increased heart failure risk in this population. Unspecified ethnicity warrants further investigation, potentially reflecting data limitations, reporting biases, or reluctance due to historical bias. Medicare insurance is strongly associated with readmission, suggesting unique challenges faced by this patient population. Behavioral factors like past tobacco use, and social determinants, including transportation barriers and lack of social support, significantly contribute to readmission risk, which align with previous studies [12, 6]. Addressing these issues through targeted interventions could help mitigate readmission risks.\nOne limitation of our analysis is that we focus solely on discharge notes to extract SDOH information, excluding other potentially valuable sources such as nursing and physician notes. These additional clinical notes might provide complementary insights into patient circumstances and could enhance the comprehensiveness of future analyses. Addressing this limitation in subsequent research could improve the robustness of SDOH identification and its predictive power for HF patient outcomes."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "Our training-free LLM-based approach enables SDOH mining from unstructured clini-cal notes. The effectiveness of our mining method is justified by the great performance over annotated data. Furthermore, we conduct downstream 30-day readmission correla-tion analysis to partially support the quality of mined SDOH. Multiple identified signifi-cant predictors of HF readmission, including old age, past tobacco usage, transportation limitation, and lack of social support, align with existing clinical findings. In the future, we plan to (1) extend our LLM-based mining approach to cover more aspects of SDOHS from various types of clinical notes, and (2) explore advanced causal relationship mining to identify novel SDOH to provide actionable insights for reducing HF readmission rate. Observing the limited numbers of notes containing certain SDOHs, we advocate for clini-cians to document these factors more consistently to enhance their utility for downstream analysis and intervention planning."}]}

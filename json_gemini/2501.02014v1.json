{"title": "Machine Learning-Based Differential Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease Using Kinematic Feature Extraction and Selection", "authors": ["Masahiro Matsumoto", "Abu Saleh Musa Miah", "Nobuyoshi Asai", "Jungpil Shin"], "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and the accumulation of abnormal synuclein. PD presents both motor and non-motor symptoms that progressively impair daily functioning. The severity of these symptoms is typically assessed using the MDS-UPDRS rating scale, which is subjective and dependent on the physician's experience. Additionally, PD shares symptoms with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), complicating accurate diagnosis. To address these diagnostic challenges, we propose a machine learning-based system for differential diagnosis of PD, PSP, MSA, and healthy controls (HC). This system utilizes a kinematic feature-based hierarchical feature extraction and selection approach. Initially, 18 kinematic features are extracted, including two newly proposed features: Thumb-to-index vector velocity and acceleration, which provide insights into motor control patterns. In addition, 41 statistical features were extracted here from each kinematic feature, including some new approaches such as Average Absolute Change, Rhythm, Amplitude, Frequency, Standard Deviation of Frequency, and Slope. Feature selection is performed using One-way ANOVA to rank features, followed by Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) to identify the most relevant ones, aiming to reduce the computational complexity. The final feature set is used for classification, achieving a classification accuracy of 66.67% for each dataset and 88.89% for each patient, with particularly high performance for the MSA and HC groups using the SVM algorithm. This system shows potential as a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool in clinical practice, though further data collection and refinement are needed to enhance its reliability.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world after Alzheimer's disease. It is caused by the degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of Lewy bodies composed of abnormal synuclein within the brain. PD has both motor and non-motor symptoms, which gradually worsen and significantly impact daily life. In particular, motor symptoms are characterized by a clinical triad of muscle rigidity, tremor, and postural reflex disturbances, which are key to diagnosing the disease [1]\u2013[3]. There are many clinical assessment methods to evaluate PD symptoms beside other disease [4]-[7], including Hoehn-Yahr staging, the Schwab and England rating, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). In particular, the MDS-UPDRS, created by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) in 2008 to revise the UPDRS, is widely used. The MDS-UPDRS is divided into four sections, with part III assessing motor symptoms [8]. In this section, the patient performs a motor task and is rated on a 5-point scale of 0 to 4 by the diagnosing physician"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "In recent years, many studies have integrated devices and algorithms to evaluate the severity of motor symptoms and differentiate diseases based on kinematic characteristics of various movements. Belic et al. developed a wearable system that uses inertial sensors [22] to perform differential diagnosis from repeated finger tapping movements [21]. In this system, five signal transformations were performed from the acceleration data obtained by the sensor: 1) raw signal representing angular velocity, 2) integral representing finger swing angle, 3) derivative representing angular acceleration, 4) square of the signal, and 5) Fourier transform representing frequency content of the signal. In this study, FT movements were recorded using sensors from 14 PD patients, 16 PSP - Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) patients, 13 MSA of predominantly parkinsonian type patients, and 11 HC patients, yielding a classification accuracy of 85.18%. Song et al. developed a classification system based on postural instability and gait analysis that can differentiate PD, ataxia, MSA - cerebellar subtype (MSA-C), and PSP-RS [19]. They employed the Enhanced Weight Voting Ensemble (EWVE) method to learn the characteristics of each disease by combining two classifiers for gait and postural instability. This allowed them to avoid errors caused by a single classifier and improve classification accuracy. The AI model used in the gait analysis was based on a machine learning method called gated recursive units (GRUs), while the AI model used in the postural instability was based on deep neural networks (DNN). In this study, 551 cases of PD, 38 cases of PSP-RS, 113 cases of cerebellar ataxia, and 71 cases of MSA-C were used for differential diagnosis between PD and each AP. The results showed that the AUC for PD vs. ataxia patients was 0.974\u00b10.036, sensitivity 0.829\u00b10.217, specificity 0.969\u00b10.038, AUC for PD vs. MSA-C was 0.975\u00b10.020, sensitivity 0.823\u00b10.162, specificity 0.932\u00b10.030, AUC for PD vs. PSP-RS 0.963\u00b10.028, sensitivity 0.555\u00b10.157, and specificity 0.936\u00b10.031. Salvatore et al. created a model to differentiate midbrain, thalamus, cortex, and corpus callosum differences between PD (n = 28) and PSP (n = 28) and healthy subjects (n = 28) from T1-weighted MRI [15]. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used for feature extraction, and SVM was used as the classification algorithm. The model to differentiate PSP from PD showed 88.9% accuracy. In addition, The model to differentiate PSP subjects from HC showed an accuracy of 89.1%.

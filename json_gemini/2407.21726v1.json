Thanks to a more efficient use of energy, we can reduce energy consumption by more than 30%."}, {"title": "Big Data Usage in IEMS", "content": "Big Data (BD) refers to huge amounts of data, both structured and unstructured, that can be used to extract useful information. BD usage has been increasing in recent years, and it is expected to continue to grow in the future because of the massive increase in global data creation(IDC 2021).\nBD is characterized by the V's (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value, and even more are being added to the list during the years) (Sagiroglu and Sinanc 2013) and, regarding energy efficiency, the most relevant characteristics are (Koseleva and Ropaite 2017; Zhou, Fu, and Yang 2016):\nVolume The amount of electricity consumption data collected by 1 million smart meters in 1 year (collecting once every 15 minutes) is about 3 TB; this presents a challenge for data storage and analysis.\nVelocity To analyze the data in real-time, the data processing speed must be fast enough to keep up with the incoming information, which means in a range that goes from sub-second to 15 minutes.\nVariety The data collected from smart meters is heterogeneous, including electricity consumption data, weather data, and customer information: each of them is useful in a different part of the industry.

It can be described as the implementation of the \"Belief-Desire-Intention\" (BDI) model, where the agent has beliefs about the environment, desires to achieve some goals, and intentions to act to achieve them.\nA Multi-Agent System (MAS) consists of an environment, objects, agents, and all their relations, a set of actions that can be performed by the entities to change the environment (Ferber 1999); each agent cooperates with the others to achieve a common goal (but it can also have its own objectives). This system makes it possible to emulate the actions and interactions of human organizations through the decomposition of problems into smaller parts; problems are solved by agents communicating. An example of decomposition occurs when a group of agents monitor the comfort temperature set by the user and another group controls the HVAC system and communicates with a service agent that collects past data to help select a new ideal temperature for the residents.\nMASs often rely on frameworks that provide the necessary tools to create and manage agents, such as JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment framework) (Bellifemine, Poggi, and Rimassa 1999) and PADE (Python Agent DEvelopment framework), the most used in the MAS community. Both of them are compatible with the FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) (O'Brien and Nicol 1998) standard, which defines the communication protocols between agents.\nIn the past there has been a lack of standardization in the communication protocols; nowadays BACnet is the leader in the market for HVAC (BACnet International 2024) systems; in the last years an open-source protocol supported by big players in the market, Matter, is arising and being established as the new standard for all the IoT devices (Connectivity Standards Alliance 2022, 2020). Optimization algorithms are used to lower the energy consumption of the building, two types of algorithms can be used: exact or heuristic. The first ones are based on mathematical models and can find the optimal solution; the second ones are not necessarily optimal, but they are faster and overall they are better suitable in problems with a human in the loop, like the energy efficiency of a building, in which a trade-off with users' comfort is needed. MASs have been proven to be promising as heuristic techniques for solving such problems whose domains are distributed, complex, and heterogeneous.\nAn interesting agent learning approach is the one described by Tuyls and Now\u00e8; Tuyls, Hoen, and Vanschoenwinkel who use Reinforcement Learning (RL): the inhabitants of an Intelligent Building (IB) are modeled as agents that play a game in which they obtain a benefit if they lower their energy consumption and they are punished if they increase it. Agents acting as humans learn to optimize the trade-off between energy consumption and their comfort. In this way, the system can learn the best configuration for the IB.\nMAS usage in the energy efficiency field can be divided into three main areas of application (Gonz\u00e1lez-Briones et al. 2018b):\nDemand Response (DR) the ability of the supplier-client system to react to the supplier's request to adjust energy consumption according to available supplies or to reduce the cost of energy. This is particularly useful in the case of demand peaks, failure, or maintenance in the grid or to exploit renewable energy sources at their best.\nHuman Behavior Simulation the simulation ability, which is, as already mentioned, a strong potential of MASs. Simulations focus on humans present in the house: their habits and preferences, their interactions with the building (appliances, heating & cooling, lighting, etc.), and the consequences of their actions on energy consumption also taking into account all the external factors (weather, time of the day, price of energy, etc.). Each person can be modeled by a separate agent, allowing the evaluation of a different behavior for each inhabitant, taking into account the heterogeneity of human behavior in the comfort pursuit. The system aims to optimize energy consumption without reducing the user's comfort sensation. Yang and Wang studied how the user's preferences can be perceived (asking the users or learning from manual adjustments made by users). Main parameters that influence energy consumption and need, a fundamental stage for improving optimization models, can be found using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Darakdjian, Bill\u00e9, and Inard 2019).\nA review of other works can be found in tables 3,4 in Gonz\u00e1lez-Briones et al..\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSN) management the use of MASs to simulate real buildings and how sensors would act in it. A classification of the most relevant elements to be monitored: occupation, preferences, activities, temperature, etc. can be found in Nguyen and Aiello.\nThe integration of Real-Time Localization Systems boosted MAS systems evolution in this field, achieving an average energy saving of 17-22% (Gonz\u00e1lez-Briones et al. 2018b). After a WSN simulation, which is especially useful in the research field, a real WSN can be deployed in situ.\nSumming up a MAS-based system should focus on the following aspects (Gonz\u00e1lez-Briones et al. 2018b):\nKnowledge and learning the agents should know the user's preferences which affect energy consumption such as tastes in terms of comfort, habits, timetables, etc., also agents should know the environment characteristics like the building's structure, the thermal relation with the external environment, weather forecast, etc.\nAnalysis, adaptation, and communication with the environment the agents should be able to analyze their prior knowledge and communicate the information that the MAS must use to adapt to the environment. To communicate with the environment, and send and receive information from it, it is necessary to deploy a WSN.\nDecision-making the agents should be able to make decisions based on the information they have, the environment, and the user's preferences. Here algorithms should give greater weight to the factors they consider appropriate; to identify the most important ones, a PCA can be used (Darakdjian, Bill\u00e9, and Inard 2019).\nThe results in energy saving that can be achieved with MAS varies between 17% and 41% based on the specialization and the target human satisfaction of the system (Gonz\u00e1lez-Briones et al. 2018a; Spears, Spears, and Heil 2005)"}, {"title": "Anomaly Detection", "content": "AI can be used to detect anomalous usage of electricity and its causes (Himeur et al. 2021). Anomalies can be caused by different factors like:\n\u2022 Wrong behavior of the user that forgets to turn off some electrical appliances.\n\u2022 Some appliances not working like they are supposed to (faults).\n\u2022 Electricity thefts.\nMoreover, an anomaly must be detected depending on the time of the day or the season, for example, it is not an anomaly if the heating system is on during the winter, but it is during the summer.\nTo determine if there is an anomalous electricity usage, the AI model must take care of a lot of aspects like the power consumption but also appliance-specific parameters, occupancy patterns, and weather conditions.\nMany anomaly detection approaches can be found in the literature:\n\u2022 Unsupervised detection (clustering, dimensionality reduction)\n\u2022 Supervised detection (Neural Networks, regression, probabilistic models)\n\u2022 Ensemble method (boosting, bagging)\n\u2022 Feature extraction (distance-based, time-series analysis, etc.)\n\u2022 Hybrid learning\n\u2022 Other techniques\nAlso, systems can be categorized based on the anomaly detection level:\nAggregated level detect anomalous consumption based on data of the main building-wise meter but, doing so, the information about the responsible appliance is lost.\nAppliance level detect using individual sub-meters to have fine-grained tracking of abnormalities.\nSpatial-temporal level detect abnormal usage related to specific days and hours and, possibly, provide users some feedback to reduce energy waste.\nA relevant challenge in this field is defining what exactly is an anomaly: it can be described as the event that occurs when the power usage is an outlier, both regarding a peak in power usage or a too-long electricity consumption; but this definition doesn't take in account the fact that if an appliance is running for a long time-span, for example, long cooking in the oven, then it can also not be an anomaly. The aim is the production of systems that have good accuracy and consider all the possible abnormal usage.\nA current problem is the lack of annotated datasets: the existent ones are mostly not labeled or contain only a small amount of anomaly samples, because of the rarity of anomalies in reality."}, {"title": "Direct vs Indirect Control", "content": "Mischos, Dalagdi, and Vrakas introduced a new distinction in IEMS classification:\nDirect Control IEMS (DCIEMS) includes all systems with the ability to modify the environment using actuators; these systems are able to process data, make decisions, and execute them, without the intervention of a human being. The advantages of Direct Control IEMS are that the occupants don't need to alter their daily routine and these systems can be involved in fault detection. Furthermore, they are better suited for people with reduced mobility.\nIndirect Control IEMS (ICIEMS) instead puts humans in the position of the actuator, forming a human-in-the-loop architecture. These systems aim to change the behavior of end-users to stop energy-wasting habits. To achieve this goal, suggestions are provided to the users through interfaces. This approach is cheaper since there is no need to buy actuators like smart sockets for every appliance; moreover, by inducing an eco-friendly behavior in the users, they will apply the acquired habits in all the other aspects of their lives, like at their workplace.\nBoth the IEMS types produce a lot of data: Direct Control IEMS through sensors, and Indirect Control IEMS through feedback from end users. Al tools can be used to process this quantity of data as described in section \"Big Data Usage in IEMS\". Machine learning tools can extract from such data the behavioral usage patterns of the users, predicting their future needs and personalizing the recommendations for each one of them. Deep learning tools can monitor the energy profile of the environment and derive information about the energy consumption of appliances. They are also able to make predictions about the next consumption in a determined time window."}, {"title": "Future proposals", "content": "Until today only a few studies have been conducted on the use of Deep Learning in the energy efficiency field, in the authors' opinion this should be the focus of future research.\nA possible approach could be to combine Deep Learning with Reinforcement Learning to enhance the learning done by Deep Learning Neural Networks in DCIEMS through both the refinements provided by a reward function based on the environment changes and the feedback provided by the human.\nAlthough the aforementioned proposal, the authors recognize that a major issue in the implementation of DL systems is the computational power requirements that are needed in training/fine-tuning, but also at inference, such power is not always available in the buildings due to the high cost of the required hardware.\nUsing DL, the \"Explainability\u201d issue arises, since the user must understand the actions (DCIEMS) or suggestions (ICIEMS) from the system in order to be compliant with them. An optimal system should be able to explain the reasons behind its output in a way that the user can understand.\nAnother proposal could be to implement gamification experiences in ICIEMS architecture to engage users in the energy-saving process, making them more aware of their energy consumption and more willing to change their habits both at home and in other buildings. An example implementation could be a mobile application that rewards the user with points for every energy-saving action taken; the user can then compete with other users globally or locally against occupants of the same building."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This paper has reviewed the literature on the use of AI and its different techniques in the energy efficiency field, focusing on Big Data produced by IoT, Anomaly Detection with AI, and the different approaches in interaction with humans and buildings.\nEnergy efficiency is a very important topic in current society since, as many studies pointed out, it can lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions and, consequently, to a reduction of climate change. This also reflects on people's health: MacNaughton et al. found that for every dollar saved on energy expenditures by smart buildings, 77 cents are saved in health and climate benefits.\nAll the reviewed papers pointed out problems in AI systems, especially the privacy aspects because models know a lot of information about the users and the buildings, and such information can be used to harm inhabitants; in case of data leaks malicious people can harm users by knowing if they are at home. A way of enforcing users' privacy in global models training is using anonymized data or, even better, using federated learning which helps to train algorithms over various de-centralized edge servers without sharing data.\nIn general, these systems are not even immune to attacks: in particular, DCIEMS are sensitive to attacks since they rely on IoT devices; a possible attack can be Denial of Service (DoS) and False Data Injection (FDI), which can affect electricity bills and load consumption."}]}

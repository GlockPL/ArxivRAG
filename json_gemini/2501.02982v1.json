This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects.\nResearch upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics has advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots.\nThis review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics.

Unlike humans, insects can accurately perceive impending collisions with only a few thousand neurons, making them ideal models for designing efficient and simplified collision detection systems.\nAmong insects, locusts excel at this ability, demonstrating the remarkable capacity to travel in swarms over long distances without collisions. A bilateral pair of lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in the locust's visual brain plays a key role in looming\u00b9 perception. Two specific LGMDs, LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified as responsible for this function. They respond most strongly to approaching objects while distinguishing between different motion types, such as receding, translational, and whole-field shifting movements [1, 2].\nAnatomical research on the LGMDs and circuitry was inaugurated in the 1970s [3-6], while two distinct types of computational models of LGMD1 emerged in the 1990s [7, 8]. The first type of computational models incorporates physical attributes, i.e., image size and speed, to represent the LGMD's response to looming objects, focusing on dendritic computations within the neuron. In contrast, the second type of models utilizes critical image cues and lateral inhibition within the signal processing pathway to LGMD1 to simulate its neural responses, enabling the distinction between approaching, receding, and translating stimuli. Although LGMD2 shows the similar"}, {"title": "2 How LGMD works as looming detectors", "content": "This section provides an overview of classic biological and computational theories of the LGMD, as well as opening questions regarding the circuits and mechanisms underlying LGMD neural processing. We begin by surveying the classic physiological findings and computational theories including two types of LGMD1 models. These models seek to emulate the intrinsic characteristics of the LGMD1 neuron, either by focusing on dendritic computations within a single neuron or by modeling the LGMD and its afferent signal processing pathway as an integrated functional neural system.\nWe then elucidate ongoing debates and recent findings that challenge traditional understandings of LGMD neural processing, including alternative hypotheses for neural circuitry, mechanisms of signal integration, and the roles of specific neuronal components. These controversies underscore the complexity of LGMD functioning and motivate continued research in this field."}, {"title": "2.1 Classic biological and computational theory on LGMD", "content": "The LGMD1 was first identified as part of a group of neurons situated in the lobula of the optic lobe in locusts, with its afferent network comprising the retina, lamina, and medulla [25] (see Fig. 2A). Each LGMD1 neuron transmits spikes directly to its postsynaptic target neuron, i.e., the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD) with a consistent latency. The DCMD connects to the contralateral nerve cord and triggers escape behaviors such as jumping and flight steering. The LGMD1 has three distinct dendritic fields: the largest, dendritic field A, receives excitatory input, while the smaller dendritic fields B and C receive feedforward inhibitory input (see Fig. 2B).\n21\nv-t,where the constant C converts angular velocity into the firing rate, while a is a coefficient related to the threshold angular size. The neural delay \u03b4 can be fitted to experimental data. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, the peak neuronal response computed by the \u03b7-function consistently occurs at a fixed delay after the simulated approaching object reaches a threshold angular size on the retina, and this threshold angular size remains invariant with respect to the size-to-speed ratio 1/|\u03c5] [27, 34-37].\nResearchers have demonstrated that the multiplicative combination of neuronal signals encoding an object's angular size and angular speed can be achieved through a logarithmic-exponential transformation in the LGMD1 neuron [38], providing further evidence that the mathematically straightforward \u03b7-function can serves as the intrinsic computational mechanism for the neuronal response of LGMD1. However, the \u03b7-function models behave like the LGMD1 only for objects approaching at a constant speed [39], lacking the capacity to simulate detailed responses to accelerating objects and other types of visual stimuli, such as recession and translation.\nOn the other hand, Rind and Simmons proposed a four-layered neural network to model the LGMD1's neuronal response to looming, receding, and translating stimuli [8] (see Fig. 3C). In this network, critical image cues (denoted as P in Fig. 3C) are generated by edges that change in extent or velocity during object approach, result-ing in strong excitation of computational units (denoted as E in Fig. 3C). Lateral"}, {"title": "2.2 Controversial arguments on LGMD neural processing", "content": "Although both categories of computational models effectively capture the neuronal characteristics of the LGMD1 when faced with looming objects, a key point of contention between these models lies in the timing of the peak response. In the first class of models, the \u03b7-function produces a peak response after a fixed delay, following the point at which the looming object reaches a specific image size threshold. However, the peak will be occurring after the object projects its maximum size onto the retina when 1/|v| \u2264 5 ms [41]. This ratio can be achieved by, for example, an 8 cm-wide object moving at 8 m/s (28.8 km/h) or a 4 cm-wide object traveling at 4 m/s (14.4 km/h). In contrast, experimental results for the second category of models indicate that the peak response consistently occurs before the looming object reaches its maximum size on the retina.\nWhile the hierarchical neural network proposed by Rind et al. clearly demonstrates how looming selectivity is generated in the LGMD1 neuron, it is worth noting that the proposed four layers may not anatomically correspond to the four layers of the locust's stratified optic lobe.\nFirstly, the photoreceptors in the retina primarily convert luminance changes into electrical signals while preserving the retinotopic organization [42-46]. However, it remains largely unknown how these photoreceptors capture or derive the critical image cues required for LGMD responses. It is also possible that these cues are derived from other layers or from the combined processing of multiple layers in the visual neural pathway. Additionally, the retina may play a role in light and dark adaptation, contributing to the LGMD neuron's ability to respond accurately under varying background-object contrast conditions [47, 48].\nSecondly, while ON and OFF contrasts are separated in lamina monopolar cells (LMCs) located in the lamina, the precise mechanisms of how these signals combine or interact, particularly in the optic lobe of locusts, are unverified. Earlier research on LGMD1 suggested that ON and OFF contrast signals jointly flow into the medulla layer, where they transmit to dendritic field A for excitation, and to dendritic trees"}, {"title": "3 LGMD-based dynamic vision systems facilitate collision-free navigation", "content": "Real-world applications based on LGMD neurons began to emerge with the advent of LGMD computational models. As discussed previously, the first type of LGMD1 model can be described by the \u03b7 function, which integrates inhibitory signals that encode the angular size (\u03b8) with excitatory signals encoding angular velocity (\u03b8) through an exponential formulation. In addition to the \u03b7 function, Keil introduced a new function called the \\varphi -function, which follows the dynamics of the RC circuit. While the \\varphi -function is also capable of fitting experimental data that aligns with the \u03b7-function, it differs by avoiding the biophysical challenges associated with implementing exponential inhibition [57]. Furthermore, the \\varphi -function was enhanced by incorporating biologically plausible inhibition regulation, resulting in a model that generates a response similar to the \u03b7-function, even in the presence of noisy information channels [58].\nAlthough these models are established with biologically plausible formulations, they are rarely used to address real-world challenges directly owing to their reliance on the physical attributes of looming objects that are impossible to measure in unpredictable, real-world environments. To alleviate this, Keil developed a multi-layer network that uses luminance values, captured by CCD or CMOS cameras, as"}, {"title": "4 How these methods feedback to neuroscience", "content": "Can bio-inspired modeling studies and bio-robotic approaches positively influence neuroscience research? This open question has sparked considerable interest across various disciplines. From our perspective, the answer is an unequivocal \"yes\". Bio-inspired modeling and bio-robotic approaches do not merely emulate biological systems; they actively contribute to understanding the underlying principles of neural and behavioral mechanisms. By replicating and testing biological phenomena in controlled environments, these approaches provide testable hypotheses that can validate, refine, or challenge existing neuroscience theories. Moreover, they offer insights into the neural substrates of behavior, bridging gaps between abstract models and tangible biological processes.\nThe behaviors of LGMD-based robotics in complex real-world interaction tasks have directly validated the robustness of the looming selectivity as artificial life comparable to that observed in LGMD neurons. In particular, the computational model of LGMD2 has been integrated into the micro-robot Colias, demonstrating a selective looming response to darker objects during real-world navigation [32]. Additionally, the Strider robot, implemented with a four-layer LGMD1 network incorporating a different correlation framework, revealed a linear relationship between time to collision and the size-to-speed ratio (1/|v|), consistent with previous findings by Gabbiani et al. [36, 37]. Similarly, the Khepera robot, controlled by an LGMD-based collision detection and avoidance system, exhibited comparable behavior specifically, as the moving speed increased, the robot generated collision warnings earlier, thereby maintaining a greater distance from obstacles [61]. F. Claire Rind, a neuroscientist who has dedicated several decades to studying the LGMD neurons, remarked that \"Insects, and locust looming detectors in particular, have already provided inspiration for visual control of robots, unmanned autonomous vehicles, and aerial drones.\" in a recent discussion on insects' 3D vision [33]. Her insights underscore the profound impact of bio-inspired research in bridging the gap between neuroscience and technological innovation, demonstrating how understanding simple biological systems can drive advancements in robotics and autonomous systems.\nBio-inspired robotics have the potential to contribute far beyond mere \"verifica-tion\". Two decades ago, scholars proposed that bio-robotic studies could serve as effective paradigms for understanding animal behavior, suggesting that the perfor-mance of bio-inspired robotics might also offer valuable insights into neuroscience and behavior [91]. Regarding LGMD2, the strongest feedback to neuroscience is the exis-tence of ON/OFF-contrast encoding neurons or neural pathways prior to the dendrites of LGMDs. Unlike research into fly visual systems, there is very limited evidence for whether/where the ON/OFF channels exist in locust's visual circuitry. Considering the homology between different insects' visual brains, and the universal findings of polarity vision across researched animals' dynamic vision systems, the simulation of LGMD2's circuits provides strong hypothesis back to neuroscience [24, 32]. At this point, Rind also commented \u201cSimulations show how response tuning for dark transitions in the LGMD2 could complement LGMD1 responses [32].\u201d\nIn recent studies, the competition between ON/OFF channels also indicate how opposite-polarity signals could interact to suppress translating-induced excitation in"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "Physiological and anatomical discoveries of the LGMD neurons have undoubtedly inspired the development of parsimonious and efficient collision detection methods, many of which have been successfully applied to mobile robots, both on the ground and in the air. The behavior of these LGMD-based robots has validated the established neuroscience and anatomical findings, while the limitations observed in complex real-world scenarios may suggest the presence of yet-undiscovered mechanisms or biological substrates within the LGMD neurons or its afferent neural circuits. The bio-inspired research paradigm of LGMDs has demonstrated considerable success in integrating neuroscience and robotics. We propose that this success can be attributed to the following two factors.\nApplication demands - First, there is an urgent need for efficient, low-energy colli-sion detection methods in real-world applications. Collisions are ubiquitous and pose significant hazards to both living creatures and intelligent robotic systems. Current collision detection methods are often energy-intensive due to the need for map recon-struction and object recognition [95-97], or they rely heavily on specific sensors such as radar or wireless ultraviolet light [98, 99].

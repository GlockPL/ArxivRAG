Early diagnosis of ADHD and treatment could significantly improve the quality of life and functioning. Recently, machine learning methods have improved the accuracy and efficiency of the ADHD diagnosis process. However, the cost of the equipment and trained staff required by the existing methods are generally huge. Therefore, we introduce the video-based frame-level action recognition network to ADHD diagnosis for the first time. We also record a real multi-modal ADHD dataset and extract three action classes from the video modality for ADHD diagnosis. The whole process data have been reported to CNTW-NHS Foundation Trust, which would be reviewed by medical consultants/professionals and will be made public in due course.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a worldwide prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder. While the adult population has a high rate of undiagnosed and has reached 3% of the population [1, 2]. ADHD patients exhibit inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity symptoms, with detrimental effects on brain development [3, 4].\nIn recent years, machine learning methods and deep learning algorithms have been used in ADHD diagnosis and classification [5, 6]. Most of the research is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), and natural language processing which achieves high accuracy [7, 8, 9], but also with a high cost of equipment and operational staff. Hence, we propose a new low-cost ADHD diagnosis approach on a machine learning-based ADHD action detection network in this work. We use video because it is easy to capture the action performance of the participants, and it can greatly reduce the cost of diagnosis. The main contributions of our work are listed as follows: 1) an attention test is designed for multi-modal ADHD real data recording. 2) an ADHD diagnosis system based on 3D-CNN action recognition is implemented, and video data is evaluated with different network structures; 3) classification criteria is also proposed to provide diagnosis results with time-action ADHD characteristics."}, {"title": "Participants and Procedure", "content": "We recorded a multi-modal ADHD dataset which includes 7 ADHD subjects diagnosed by the NHS medical consultant under the DSM-V criteria and 10 neurotypical controls.

Each of the clips is between 10-15 seconds. The training, validation, and testing data split is 6/2/2, respectively. The diagnosis dataset for the whole system consists of 34 videos, including 7 subjects and 10 controls of the whole process videos from the left and right sides, and the length of each video is 60-90 minutes. Actions are labeled per three frames in the training, testing, and diagnosis steps."}, {"title": "Experiment Set up and Comparisons", "content": "We choose a 3D-CNN structure (C3D) as the main core network [10, 11]. There are 8 convolution layers that have 3\u00d73\u00d73 kernels with 1 stride. Different from the original C3D structure, we add a fully connected layer to fit the size of the input data. The probabilities of each action are obtained with three fully connected layers with 8192 units and a Softmax activation.\nThe loss $L_c$ of the training process is to minimize the cross entropy of the outputs and true labels results:\n$L_c = - \\sum_i P_t(i) \\log P_o(i)$"}, {"title": "Action Recognition and ADHD Diagnosis Results", "content": "In these experiments, the SR performance of 7 subjects and 10 controls is evaluated with $SR_L$, $SR_R$, and $SR_{Avg}$.

Meanwhile, a novel measure was proposed to evaluate the action recognition results. The experimental results showed that our system outperformed the state-of-the-art methods regarding precision, accuracy, and AUC.\nMoreover, the proposed method is less expensive and suitable for a broad range of initial ADHD diagnoses compared with the existing neuroscience diagnostic methods. In our future work, we will extend the dataset to further cover real-world patient distribution and consider recording more multi-modal data, e.g., EEG and fMRI, to perform fusion and evaluate related results."}]}

Accurate flood forecasting is essential for mitigating the adverse effects on human lives and infrastructure. This project investigates the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to enhance flood prediction accuracy and efficiency, specifically focusing on the Wupper River in Germany during 2023.\nTraditional flood prediction models rely on classical machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), regression, and Autoregressive (AR) models. While effective, these methods face limitations in handling large datasets and complex patterns inherent in environmental data. QML offers a promising alternative by exploiting quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement, which enable the processing of vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds.\nOur approach integrates classical and quantum models, including SVM, KNN, Adaboost, Quantum Variational Circuits, QBoost, and QSVC_ML, to develop a hybrid system for flood prediction. By comparing the performance of classical and QML models based on training time, accuracy, and scalability, we aim to demonstrate the superiority of QML in handling intricate flood prediction tasks.\nThe results indicate that QML models not only enhance prediction accuracy but also reduce computational time, making them a viable option for real-time flood forecasting.

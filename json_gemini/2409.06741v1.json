Introduction", "content": "Software engineering (SE) faces escalating challenges as systems grow in complex- ity and scale. Modern software must meet diverse functional requirements while en- suring reliability, security, and maintainability [1]. The discipline of SE encompasses the entire software lifecycle, from requirements elicitation to system maintenance, aiming to enhance development efficiency and quality through systematic methods and technical strategies. Despite significant advancements, complex projects fre- quently encounter issues such as delays, cost overruns, and system defects. Lederer et al. demonstrated through empirical studies that frequent change requests from users and their lack of understanding of requirements are primary contributors to cost overruns [2]. In addition, the Standish Group's \u201c2020 CHAOS Report\u201d reveals that only 31% of software projects are completed on time and within budget, with a mere 46% delivering high-value returns [3]. These findings underscore the critical need to optimize the requirements engineering (RE) phase to improve the success rate of software projects and reduce costs.\nThe integration of AI into SE (AI for SE) has transformed traditional practices, particularly in areas such as code generation, defect prediction, and software testing, substantially improving efficiency and quality across development processes [4, 5, 6]. AI's ability to automate and enhance these tasks has paved the way for more intel- ligent and adaptive SE practices. Building on these advancements, current research is increasingly focused on extending the benefits of AI to requirements engineering (AI for RE), with the goal of addressing the unique challenges in eliciting, analyzing, and validating software requirements. This shift marks an important evolution from AI's traditional role in SE toward a more specialized focus on using generative AI (GenAI) to optimize RE practices. These AI-based approaches in SE lay the founda- tion for the application of more advanced GenAI techniques, such as large language models (LLMs), in various SE tasks. The success of AI in improving software devel- opment processes and quality sets the stage for exploring the potential of GenAI in the specific domain of RE.\nRE holds a critical role within SE because it focuses on the systematic elici- tation, analysis, specification, validation, and management of both functional and non-functional requirements [7]. The importance of RE in the software development lifecycle is widely recognized and has been codified in international standards such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018.

The application of this scoring system"}, {"title": "5.4. RQ4: Gaps and Future Directions", "content": "Although GenAI has demonstrated immense potential in revolutionizing RE prac- tices, a critical analysis of the current research landscape reveals several limitations that warrant further exploration. One prominent limitation is the predominant focus on leveraging LLMs, such as the GPT series, for requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation. This approach may encounter challenges when confronted with com- plex, domain-specific requirements, particularly in highly specialized or safety-critical domains, where GenAI may struggle to fully comprehend and capture nuanced do- main knowledge and constraints.\nIn addressing these challenges and considering the various characteristics and properties of LLMs in the context of RE, our approach was guided by the compre- hensive framework outlined in the survey by Naveed et al. [87]. This survey provides a structured overview of the key aspects and challenges in LLM development and application, which we have adapted to the specific context of RE. We particularly focused on the critical areas identified in their work, including computational costs, bias and fairness issues, interpretability and explainability, and concerns related to safety and controllability, all of which have significant implications for RE practices.\nIn addition, a significant imbalance exists in the existing research, with a pre- dominant concentration on the early stages of the RE process, such as requirements elicitation and analysis. Comparatively, there is a paucity of research exploring the later stages, including requirements management, evolution, and long-term mainte- nance. This disparity in research focus may lead to an incomplete understanding of GenAI's applicability and potential across the entire RE lifecycle. Furthermore, con- cerns regarding the interpretability and traceability of GenAI outputs persist because understanding decision rationales and maintaining requirement sources are pivotal aspects of RE.\nBy aligning our analysis with this established framework, we ensured a thor- ough and systematic examination of the multifaceted nature of LLMs in the specific context of RE. Key challenges and limitations include:\n\u2022 Bias and Fairness: Our analysis shows that existing research predominantly emphasizes the functional application of GenAI models in RE tasks, often over- looking the critical issue of bias. This overlooking of bias is particularly concerning during the requirements elicitation and analysis phases, where implicit biases in training data can be unintentionally amplified by models. These biases not only pose ethical concerns, such as perpetuating societal stereotypes, but also have im- portant implications in high-stakes applications such as hiring or law enforcement [88, 89]. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, includ- ing the careful curation of training data and the development of fairness-aware algorithms [90]. Future research should prioritize techniques for identifying and\n\u2022 Ethical and Regulatory Concerns: Our review found that most studies did not thoroughly explore the ethical implications of applying GenAI to RE, even though requirements are foundational to the software development lifecycle. The integration of LLMs in RE tasks introduces unique ethical challenges, such as the potential for generating biased or harmful content, facilitating misinformation, or misinterpreting user intentions [33, 91]. As the role of GenAI in RE expands, an urgent need exists to establish ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks tailored to the specific challenges of RE. Collaboration between researchers, poli- cymakers, and industry stakeholders is essential to ensure that the use of GenAI in RE is responsible, aligned with societal norms, and adheres to ethical standards, helping mitigate risks while fostering innovation in the field.\n\u2022 Security and Privacy: LLMs used in RE often process large volumes of data, including sensitive and confidential project requirements. Although some studies briefly mention security as an important characteristic in RE, few specifically ad- dressed the critical concerns of ensuring data privacy and model security when using GenAI. In adversarial settings, malicious actors may attempt to manipulate outputs or extract confidential information from these models [34, 35]. As GenAI is increasingly applied to sensitive RE tasks, developing robust security protocols and privacy-preserving techniques tailored to handling sensitive requirements will be crucial for mitigating these risks. Ensuring both the integrity of the models and the confidentiality of the data they process should be a key research focus moving forward.\n\u2022 Interpretability and Explainability: Despite the recognized importance of interpretability in RE, a substantial research gap exists in exploring the explain- ability of LLMs and GenAI systems in RE tasks [36]. As these models become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes for requirements generation and analysis grows increasingly challenging, raising concerns about re- liability and accountability, especially in sensitive domains such as healthcare and law. Future RE research must focus on developing novel, RE-specific explainability techniques for LLMs, addressing how these models leverage pre-trained knowledge and in-context learning for RE tasks [37]. Improving the transparency and inter- pretability of GenAI models in RE is crucial for ensuring stakeholder trust and effective integration of these technologies into RE practices.\n\u2022 Computational and Economic Cost: Training and deploying LLMs for RE demand significant computational resources, leading to substantial economic and environmental costs. Our review nonetheless found that most studies failed to address the computational and economic implications of applying GenAI in RE, which is an alarming oversight given the considerable expenses involved in training and maintaining these models. The power consumption associated with large- scale training is a growing concern, as is the concentration of LLM development within well-funded organizations, potentially exacerbating inequalities within AI research [38, 39]. Future research must prioritize evaluating the cost-effectiveness of GenAI technologies in RE and exploring more sustainable and economically viable alternatives to deploying these models in practice.\n\u2022 Real-Time Processing: Although LLMs are increasingly expected to handle real-time processing tasks, such as interactive dialogues and decision-making in dynamic environments, most research in GenAI for RE remains focused on the earlier stages of RE, such as elicitation and analysis. Few studies have explored how GenAI can adapt to dynamically changing requirements or process new re- quirement information in real-time. Meeting the demands of real-time performance while maintaining accuracy and robustness poses an ongoing challenge, particu- larly as models scale and tasks become more complex [40]. Developing GenAI systems capable of responding to rapidly evolving project environments will be an essential direction for future research in RE.\n\u2022 Hallucinations: Recent research has extensively characterized hallucinations in LLM outputs, categorizing them into input-conflicting, context-conflicting, and fact-conflicting types. Although various mitigation strategies have been proposed, including improved data curation, reinforcement of learning techniques, and lever- aging external knowledge [41, 42], their applicability in high-stakes domains such as RE remains largely unexplored. Given the critical role that accurate requirements play in project success, reducing hallucinations and improving the precision of gen- erated requirements are critical areas for future research. Because hallucinations can have significant consequences in RE tasks, more focused exploration of effective mitigation strategies is needed, including developing reliable automated evaluation metrics specific to RE, adapting existing techniques such as multi-agent interac- tion and uncertainty estimation to RE contexts, and exploring novel approaches that ensure LLMs can deliver reliable outputs in complex and accuracy-demanding scenarios. In addition, investigating the trade-offs between reducing hallucinations and maintaining model capabilities in RE applications is crucial for the practical implementation of LLMs."}, {"title": "6. Threats to Validity", "content": "In this systematic literature review, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of potential threats to the validity of the findings, encompassing internal, external, and construct validity aspects of the research. By critically examining these threats, we aim to provide a transparent and rigorous evaluation of the limitations and strategies employed to mitigate them. Internal validity, which pertains to the robustness and integrity of the research design and execution, is subject to two primary threats. First, despite the implementation of a systematic literature search and screening method, the inherent risk of inadvertently omitting relevant studies remains. This threat arises from the possibility of studies being indexed in databases not covered by our search strategy or studies using alternative terminology not captured by our search strings. To mitigate this threat, we conducted a comprehensive search across multiple reputable databases and applied a meticulously crafted set of inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the identification of pertinent literature. Second, the process of data extraction and analysis is susceptible to subjective judgments and potential biases introduced by individual researchers. To address this concern, we used a standardized data extraction template to maintain consistency and imple- mented a rigorous cross-checking procedure involving three independent researchers to minimize bias and ensure the reliability of the extracted data.\nThe external validity of the study, which pertains to the generalizability and ap- plicability of the findings to wider contexts, is subject to two primary limitations that may circumscribe the extent to which the results can be extrapolated beyond the specific research setting. The temporal scope of the study, focusing on literature published between 2019 and 2024, may not fully capture the comprehensive state of GenAI applications in RE. This limitation is particularly relevant given the rapid evolution and proliferation of GenAI technologies in recent years. Consequently, the findings of this review may not entirely reflect the most recent advancements and innovations in the field. In addition, the generalizability of the conclusions drawn from this study may be limited by the specific characteristics and contexts of the included studies, such as the domain of application, the scale of the projects, and the cultural or organizational settings in which the research was conducted. These limitations underscore the importance of interpreting the findings with caution and considering the specific contextual factors when applying the insights to different scenarios. Construct validity, which relates to the definition and measurement of re- search concepts, presents inherent challenges in the domain of GenAI applications in RE.

Our findings clearly indicate that GenAI is making substantial contributions to enhancing functional suitability, reli- ability, and efficiency in RE processes, offering innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in the field. However, our review also reveals several limitations and chal- lenges in the current research landscape. A notable imbalance exists in research focus, with a concentration on early stages of the RE process, particularly require- ments elicitation and analysis. By contrast, GenAI applications in later stages such as requirements management, evolution, and long-term maintenance has been un- derexplored. This disparity suggests a critical gap in understanding how GenAI can support the full RE lifecycle.\nThe application of GenAI in complex, domain-specific, or safety-critical areas remains a substantial challenge. Current models often struggle with nuanced, spe- cialized requirements, highlighting the need for more sophisticated approaches to domain knowledge integration. In addition, ensuring the interpretability and trace- ability of AI-generated outputs poses a persistent challenge and is crucial for main- taining transparency and accountability in RE processes. Our review also identified critical issues that demand urgent attention from the research community. These include concerns about bias and fairness in AI-generated content, ethical and regu- latory considerations, security and privacy risks associated with processing"}]}

Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly competent at language generation tasks. The standard process of training LLMs involves unsupervised learning of language structure from large corpora (pre-training; Achiam et al., 2023); followed by supervised fine-tuning on specific tasks. For instance, conversational assistants are trained to provide helpful answers to user questions that are aligned with human preferences (instruction tuning; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) Since pre-training datasets, such as Common Crawl, can contain undesirable content (Luccioni and Viviano, 2021), LLMs are able to generate such content, including offensive language and illegal advice. This known failure mode of LLMs is an unintended consequence of their ability to generate answers that are coherent to user input, to the detriment of safety (Wei et al., 2024). To mitigate this problem, models have been optimised to not only follow instructions, but also respond in a manner that is safe, aligned with human values (safety tuning; Bai et al., 2022a,b) These chat models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which evade the defences introduced by safety tuning with strategies such as using low-resource languages in prompts, refusal suppression, privilege escalation and distractions (Schulhoff et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024b; Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024). This has motivated the development of Guardrails which monitor exchanges between chat models and users, flagging harmful entries, and are an important component of AI safety stacks in deployed systems (Dong et al., 2024a). One research direction uses model-based guardrails (guard models) that are separate from the chat models themselves (Inan et al., 2023; Madaan, 2024)\u00b9. However, this introduces a prohibitive computational overhead in low-resource settings. Learning is also inefficient: language understanding abilities of the chat models will significantly overlap those of the guard models, if both are to effectively perform their individual tasks, response generation and content moderation, respectively. In this paper, we propose: de-duplicating such abilities via parameter sharing between the chat and the guard models; as well as parameter-efficient fine-tuning; integrating both the chat and the guard models into what we refer to as LoRA-Guard. It uses a low-rank adapter (LoRA; Hu et al., 2021) on a backbone transformer of a chat model in order to learn the task of detecting harmful content, given examples of harmful and harmless exchanges. LORA parameters are activated for guardrailing, and the harmfullness label is provided by a classification head. LoRA parameters are deactivated for chat usages, when the original language modelling head is employed for response generation. Our contributions are: (1) LoRA-Guard, an efficient and moderated conversational system, performing guardrailing with parameter overheads reduced by 100-1000x vs. previous approaches, making guard model deployment feasible in resource-constrained settings (Fig. 2); (2) performance evaluations on individual datasets and zero-shot across datasets; (3) published weights for guard models.2"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "A guard model \\(G\\) for a generative chat model \\(C\\) categorizes each input and/or corresponding output of \\(C\\) according to a taxonomy of harmfulness categories. The taxonomy could include coarse-grained categories, such as 'safe' and \"unsafe\", or could further distinguish between fine-grained categories, such as \"violence\u201d, \u201chate\u201d, \u201cillegal\", etc. We now introduce LORA-Guard. We assume a chat model \\(C\\) consisting of an embedding \\(\\phi\\), a feature map \\(f\\) and a linear language modelling head \\(h_{chat}\\). The embedding maps tokens to vectors; the feature map (a Transformer variant; Vaswani et al., 2017) maps these vectors into further representations; and the language modelling head maps these representations into next-token logits. If \\(x\\) represents a tokenized input sequence, then the next token logits are computed by \\(h_{chat}(f(\\phi(x))))\\). We propose to build the guard model \\(G\\) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods applied to \\(f\\), and instantiate this idea with LoRA adapters, which add additional training parameters in the form of low-rank (i.e. parameter-efficient) matrices (see Appendix A for details). Other adaptation methods are possible (Sung et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Lialin et al., 2023; Houlsby et al., 2019). The same tokenizer and embedding is used for \\(C\\) and \\(G\\). However, \\(G\\) uses a different feature map \\(f'\\) chosen as LoRA adapters attached to \\(f\\); and also uses a separate output head \\(h_{guard}\\) (linear, without bias), which maps features to harmfulness categories. Tokenized content \\(x\\) is therefore classified by \\(h_{guard}(f'(\\phi(x))))\\). Deactivating the LoRA adapters and using the language modelling head gives the original chat model, while activating the LORA adapters and using the guard model head gives the guard model. These generative and guarding paths, respectively, are depicted in Figure 1. We do not merge the LoRA adapters after training. The dual path design of LoRA-Guard, based on adaptation instead of alignment, has an important advantage over existing alternatives: since the generative task is unaffected, LoRA-Guard avoids performance degradation on the generative task, which is a common drawback of fine-tuning approaches (catastrophic forgetting; Luo et al., 2023). Most parameters, namely those in \\(f\\), are shared between the generative and guarding paths. Therefore, the parameter overhead incurred by the guard model is only that of the LoRA adapters \\(f'\\), and of the guard output head \\(h_{guard}\\). This is a tiny fraction of the number of parameters used by the chat system, often 3 orders of magnitude smaller, as will be seen in Table 1. We stress that deactivating the LoRA adapters and activating the language modelling head recovers exactly the original chat model, thereby, no loss in performance is possible. The guard model is trained by supervised fine-tuning \\(f'\\) and \\(h_{guard}\\) on a dataset labelled according to the chosen taxonomy. Datasets are discussed in Section 3.1. During training, the parameters of the chat model \\(f\\) remain frozen. Thereby, adapters of"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Models We evaluate LORA-Guard by training our guard adaptations with 3 different chat models: TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024, 1.1B-Chat-v1.0), Llama2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023a), and Llama3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024). We use the instruction tuned variants of each model to replicate their dual use as chat applications. Datasets We use two datasets: (1) ToxicChat consists of 10, 165 prompt-response pairs from the Vicuna online demo (Lin et al., 2023b; Chiang et al., 2023), each annotated with a binary toxicity label (toxic or not), which we use as the target class for the guard model. We train the LoRA-Guard models on the concatenation of prompt-response pairs with the formatting: user: {prompt}<newline> agent: {response} (truncated if necessary). (2) OpenAIModEval consists of 1,680 prompts (no model responses) collected from publicly available sources, labelled according to a taxonomy with 8 categories (Markov et al., 2023). See Appendix B.1 for data details. Baselines We compare LORA-Guard with existing guard models: (1) Llama-Guard (Inan et al., 2023) fine-tunes Llama2-7b on a non-released dataset with 6 harmfulness categories (multi-class, multi-label); it outputs a text which is parsed to determine the category labels. (2) ToxicChat-T5-large (Lin et al., 2024) fine-tunes a T5-large model (Raffel et al., 2020) on the ToxicChat dataset; it outputs a text representing whether the input is toxic or not. (3) OpenAI Moderation API is a proprietary guard model, trained on proprietary data with 8 harmfulness categories (Markov et al., 2023); it outputs scores indicating its degree of belief as to whether the content falls into each of the categories (multi-class, multi-label). We provide two additional baselines: self-defence, where an LLM judges the harmfulness of content (Phute et al., 2024; Appendix D); and a linear classifier trained with the chat features only (no LoRA adaptation), termed head fine-tuning (Appendix E)."}, {"title": "Setup", "content": "Models We evaluate LORA-Guard by training our guard adaptations with 3 different chat models: TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024, 1.1B-Chat-v1.0), Llama2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023a), and Llama3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024).

In almost all cases, LoRA-Guard outperforms baselines on AUPRC, including fully fine-tuned LLM-based guards which incur massive overheads (~1500\u00d7 for LoRA-Guard-TinyLlama vs Llama-Guard-FFT). OpenAIModEval results are shown in Table 2. LoRA-Guard is competitive with alternative methods, but with a parameter overhead 100\u00d7 smaller compared to Llama-Guard. Appendix C provides results with different hyperparameters, for both datasets. Cross-domain To estimate the ability of LORA-Guard to generalise to harmfulness domains unseen during training, we evaluated, on OpenAIModEval (OM), models trained on ToxicChat (TC), and vice-versa. TC models output one binary label, while OM models output a binary label for each of 8 harmfulness categories. As such, when training on TC and evaluating on OM, we considered an OM sample as harmful if labelled harmful according to any category, or had missing labels. Conversely, OM models output 8 binary labels, one for each OM category. When evaluating on TC, we binarise model output as follows: it indicates harmfulness if any of the 8 binary labels are set. AUPRC values are shown in Table 3; further metrics in Appendix C. Comparing Table 3a (train on TC, evaluate on OM) with Table 2 (train and evaluate on OM), we do not notice a drop in AUPRC larger than 0.02. However, comparing Table 3b (train on OM, evaluate on TC) with Table 1 (train and evaluate on TC), we notice a considerable drop in AUPRC, e.g. from 0.9 to 0.39 for LORA-Guard-Llama3-8b vs Llama-Guard. In addition, the AUPRC range increases from 0.01 to 0.3. LORA-Guard trained on TC seems to generalise to OM with marginal loss in performance, but not vice-versa. It could be that the type of harmfulness reflected in OM is also found in TC, but not vice versa. We consider further investigations into this. Possible explanations include: different input formats (TC contains user prompts, while OM does not); and a fragment of ToxicChat samples being engineered to act as jailbreaks (Lin et al., 2023b). Consult Tables 10 and 11 (Appendix C) for further metrics."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "LORA-Guard is a moderated conversational system that greatly reduces the guardrailing parameter overhead, by a factor of 100-1000x in our experiments, reducing training/inference time and memory requirements, while maintaining or improving performance. This can attributed to its knowledge sharing and parameter-efficient learning mechanisms. Fine-tuning catastrophic forgetting is also implicitly prevented by the dual-path design (cf. Fig. 1). We consider LoRA-Guard to be an important stepping stone towards guardrailing on resource-constrained portables\u2014an essential task given the increased adoption of on-device LLMs. Potential Risks Future work can consider improving cross-domain generalisation, e.g. by finding the minimum amount of samples from the target domain that could be used to adapt LoRA-Guard to that domain. It is risky to deploy LoRA-Guard to arbitrary domains without such efforts."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "LORA-Guard has some limitations: First, our system requires access to the chat system weights, so is only applicable in these cases and cannot be applied to black-box systems. Second, the taxonomy is fixed in our system, and adaptation to different taxonomies requires retraining unlike Llama-Guard which can adapt via in-context learning. Though our guard output head is chosen to be a classifier mapping feature into class probabilities, an output head that produces text as in Llama-Guard is still possible in our framework. Third, we warn against generalization across different domains due to dataset differences and lack of robustness training. The phenomenon is common in machine learning systems and can lead to wrong predictions when applied to data that is considerably different from the training data. In our case, this can lead to over-cautious predictions (misclassifying harmless samples as harmful) which causes the system to refuse to deliver harmless content; as well as under-cautious predictions (misclassifying harmful samples as harmless) which causes the system to deliver harmful content. The implications of delivering harmful content are more serious, though we emphasize that a guard model can only fail to detect harmful content, whose origin is the chat model response or the user prompts. Nevertheless, to achieve a more trustworthy guard system which we can confidently deploy requires more robust training and further evaluations. This will be improved in future work."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations", "content": "We believe an important conversation in the field of AI safety is around the taxonomy of harmfulness categories that is used to direct the development of safety mechanism, such as guardrails. There are categories of harmfulness that are more self-evident than others, such as those categories imposed by the moral law and the judiciary system. Others, however, are more particular to specific cultures and demographic groups. If LLM systems are to be adopted across cultures and demographic groups, we argue guardrails should be aware of the norms of conduct withing those groups. The method we suggest in this paper might contribute to a wider adoption of content-moderated LLMs, due to reducing the computational overhead, making guardrails more available on portable devices; thus available to more people, e.g. those who do not necessarily enjoy a fast internet connection such that guardrailing can be done \u201cin the cloud\". However, our method is oblivious to the norms that it is being adapted to as such. The ability to perform guardrailing is only a part of the process. The other part is having the resources that reflect culture and demographic norms, such as demographic-specific datasets, on which guardrails can be trained. We suggest this as an essential direction of future research. We advise caution with deploying a general-purpose guardrails across multiple cultural and demographic groups.

Jailbreak attacks have been shown to effectively generate harmful content (Rao et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023). The overarching goal of jailbreak is to trick the model into ignoring or deprioritizing its safety mechanisms, thus open up the door for harmful content to be generated. Simple approaches such as manual prompting have shown remarkable result considering their simplicity (walkerspider, 2022; Mowshowitz, 2022; Witten, 2022; Guzey, 2023; Zeng et al., 2024). Some example strategies include: instructing to model to ignore previous (potentially safety) instructions (Perez and Ribeiro, 2022; Shen et al., 2023; Schulhoff et al., 2023); asking the model to start the answer with \u201cAbsolutely! Here's \" to condition the generation process to follow a helpful direction (Wei et al., 2024); using low-resource languages of alternative text modes such as ciphers, for which pre-training data exists but safety data may be lacking (Yong et al., 2023; Barak, 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024); inducing persona modulation or role-playing (Shah et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023); using an LLM assistant to generate jailbreak prompts (WitchBOT, 2023; Shah et al., 2023); or using iterative prompt refinement to evade safeguards (Takemoto, 2024; Russinovich et al., 2024). More complex approaches involve automated rather than manually-crafted prompts. Automation can be achieved through LLM assistants which generate and/or modify prompts (Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023) or using optimization algorithms. Black-box optimization approaches rely exclusively on model outputs such as those available from closed-access models. Lapid et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023) use genetic algorithms, and Mehrotra et al. (2023); Takemoto (2024) use iterative refinement to optimize adversarial prompts. In contrast, white-box optimization approaches assume open-access to the LLMs and thus can use gradient information. Zou et al. (2023) use Greedy Coordinate Gradient to find a prompt suffix that causes LLMs to produce objectionable content, and Zhu et al. (2023) uses uses a dual-goal attack that is capable of jailbreaking as well as stealthiness, thus avoiding perplexity filters that can easily detect unreadable gibberish text. In between black-box and white-box there are also grey-box optimization approaches which use token probabilities (Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Paulus et al., 2024). Defences. In addition to the development of safety alignment approaches (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b), other defence mechanisms have been proposed to detect undesirable content\u2014we will refer to these collectively as Guardrails (Markov et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024a). Some Guardrails are based on the self-defence principle whereby an LLM is used to evaluate the safety of user-provided prompts or model-generated responses (Helbling et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023); other approaches are based on self-reminders placed in system prompts which remind LLMs to answer according to safety guidelines (Xie et al., 2023); others use in-context learning to strengthen defences without retraining or fine-tuning (Wei et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2023a; Zhou et al., 2024; Varshney et al., 2023); yet oth-"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "LoRA. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA; Hu et al., 2021) is a popular method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of neural network models. LoRA is performed by freezing the weights of the pre-trained model and adding trainable low-rank perturbations, replacing pre-trained weights \\(W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\) with \\(W + AB\\) where \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}\\), \\(B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}\\), \\(r\\) is the rank of the perturbations, and \\(\\alpha\\) is a scaling constant. During training, \\(W\\) is frozen, and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are trainable parameters. We refer to \\(r\\), the rank of the perturbations, as the LoRA rank. Training the low-rank perturbations rather than the original parameters can vastly reduce the number of trainable parameters, often without affecting performance compared to a full fine-tune (Hu et al., 2021). After training, the low-rank perturbations can optionally be merged (by addition) into the pre-trained parameters meaning that the fine-tuning process incurs zero additional inference latency in general. In this work, we store the LoRA perturbations \\(\\alpha W = AB\\) separately from the pretrained parameters, so that we may activate and deactivate it for guard and chat applications respectively."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Datasets ToxicChat We use the January 2024 (0124) version available on HuggingFace.

We refer to the initial 5082 training examples as the full train split and to the 4096 examples on which the model is actually trained as the training split. We use the toxicity annotation as a target label, which is a binary indicator of whether the prompt-response pair is determined to be toxic.

Datasets are accessed through HuggingFace datasets (Lhoest et al., 2021) module. For multi-GPU training with data parallel and gradient accumulation, we use the HuggingFace accelerate package (Gugger et al., 2022). ToxicChat We train the guard models using the LORA-Guard method on top of each of the chat models specified earlier. Training is performed on 8 NVIDIA A40s using data parallel with per-device batch size of 2, right padding and gradient accumulation (the number of accumulation steps determines the overall batch size), except for the TinyLlama runs where we used only 2 A40s and a per-device batch size of 8. All computation is done in the PyTorch 16 bit brain float data type bfloat16. We vary the batch size and LoRA rank across experiments, and run each configuration for 3 independent random seeds. The LORA \u03b1 parameter is set to twice the rank on each experiment (following Raschka (2023)) and the LORA layers use dropout with probability 0.05. We initialise the guard model output heads using Xavier uniform initialisation (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). In the notation of Appendix A:LoRA, we initialise the LORA parameters by setting B to 0 and using Kaiming uniform initialisation (He et al., 2015) for A. LORA adaptation is applied only to the query and key values of attention parameters in the chat models (no other layers or parameters are adapted). We train the model for 20 epochs on the training split using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with learning rate \\(3 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and cross-entropy loss. We weight the positive term in the loss by the ratio of the number of negative examples to that of positive examples in the training split. At the end of each epoch, we perform a sweep across the entire train, validation and test splits calculating various performance metrics with a classification threshold of 0.5. We report the test set performance of the model checkpoint (end of epoch) with the highest score for area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) on the validation set. OpenAI Moderation Evaluation Except as detailed below, all training details are the same as for ToxicChat, detailed in this Appendix. The models are obtained using a guard model head with 8 outputs, each of which corresponds to a different category in the taxonomy. We treat the problem as multilabel classification and use the binary cross entropy loss for each label, where the positive term is weighted by the ratio of non-positive examples to positive examples for that category. When training, the models receive no gradients for categories where the given example does have a target label. We compare our models to LlamaGuard evaluated on our test split (see Appendix G), where the system prompt has been adapted to the OpenAI taxonomy. The chat template used in the tokenizer is given in Fig. 3. For the LORA-Guard evaluations, we chose the best performing batch size, LoRA rank and epoch checkpoint determined by max median of the mean AUPRC across categories (computed independently for each category) on a validation set evaluated across 3 seeds. We report metrics on our test split according to binary labels of whether the prompt is toxic or not. We consider a prompt unsafe unless it is labelled as safe according to all of categories in the taxonomy (this is a conservative approach to harmful content). For the LoRA-Guard models, an example is predicted as unsafe if it is predicted as belonging to any of the categories and we compute the classification score for an example as the max of the scores over the categories. For Llama-Guard, since it outputs text rather than classification scores, the classification score is the score of the token unsafe in the first token produced in generation.

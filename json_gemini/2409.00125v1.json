Additionally, the features of these data sets are typically limited to the spatial coordinates of the scattered observation locations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates data-driven spatial dependency feature extraction with rule-assisted spatial dependency function mapping to augment domain knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in two comparative application scenarios, highlighting its ability to capture more localized spatial features in the reconstructed distribution fields. Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets. Our framework introduces an innovative approach to spatial information estimation by synergistically combining observational data with rule-assisted domain knowledge.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Spatially dependent properties are widespread across various fields, including subsurface resource exploitation [1, 2, 3, 4], water resources management [5, 6], traffic engineering [7, 8], and environmental studies [9, 10]. These spatially varying attributes are typically recorded at a limited number of observed points or monitoring stations, often insufficient to represent the entire and multiscale spatial distribution accurately [60, 61]. Due to the impracticality of monitoring every part of a domain to fully capture its attribute field, spatial interpolation is commonly employed to estimate values at unobserved locations, utilizing observed data and underlying spatial dependency correlations [11, 59]."}, {"title": "", "content": "Numerous spatial interpolation methods exist, as reviewed by Li and Heap [12], who suggest that these methods often rely on similar principles, such as inverse distance weighting [13] and kriging [14]. The inverse distance weighting approach, which is built on a straightforward distance-based method, is generally unsuitable for spatially aggregated observations. Kriging, on the other hand, functions as an unbiased linear estimator under the assumption of a stationary normal distribution. Since it utilizes the conditional distribution of a Gaussian process, kriging is essentially a specific case of Gaussian process regression [15, 16]. However, all these methods are founded on simplified assumptions, including stationarity, linearity, and normality, which limit their applicability in real-world scenarios [16, 17, 18]. In particular, their reliance on linear interpolation makes them inadequate for handling complex nonlinear spatial dependency relationships, often resulting in suboptimal estimations for continuous attribute fields. Therefore, there is a clear need for alternative approaches that can construct non-stationary, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian spatial dependency functions for spatial interpolation."}, {"title": "", "content": "Given their versatile nonlinear approximation capabilities, the emerging data-driven approaches are promising to provide an alternative framework for spatial information modeling [10, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Various machine learning-based methods, such as random forests [23, 50, 51], artificial neural networks [24, 25, 26], radial basis function networks [17, 52], long short-term memory networks [27, 53], convolutional neural networks [28, 29], conditional generative adversarial networks [18, 54, 55], and ensemble learning [30, 56], have been successfully adapted and applied to spatial interpolation. However, without significant reengineering, these original machine learning methods are not inherently designed for spatial interpolation and often fail to account for the available spatial configuration information. In other words, directly applying these machine learning models may pose challenges and may not be suitable for most spatial interpolation scenarios [31, 62]."}, {"title": "", "content": "While methods involving convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks are well-suited for imagery or regularly gridded datasets, such as terrain elevation images, observational data are often irregularly sparse and scattered [32, 57]. Traditional deep learning methods may not be ideal for extracting spatial dependency features from such sparse observations, as they typically only rely on the spatial coordinates of the observation locations as input features [33]. To address this limitation, modified approaches have been developed. For example, Wu et al. proposed an inductive graph neural network Kriging model that better leverages distance information [34], while Ma et al. introduced a geo-layer into long short-term memory networks to integrate spatial correlations from monitoring stations [35]. In essence, effectively extracting spatial dependency features from irregularly sparse observed data necessitates considering both individual observations and their neighboring spatial configurations."}, {"title": "", "content": "In addition to the data-driven approaches, the family of rule-based fuzzy inference systems can effectively model nonlinear functions by leveraging inherent reasoning paradigms [36, 37, 38, 39, 58]. Unlike data-driven methods, fuzzy inference systems can directly and broadly incorporate expert knowledge, making them valuable for enhancing spatial interpolation [39]. For example, the first law of geography, which states that \u201cnear things are more related than distant things\" [40], can be articulated as a fuzzy IF-THEN rule-IF two spatial observations are closer, THEN their spatial dependency correlations are stronger. This rule underpins many existing interpolation methods that rely on concepts of distance and neighborhood. Similarly, there is a wealth of domain-specific knowledge related to both general spatial dependencies and particular interpolation scenarios. For instance, Yesilkanat et al. [41] demonstrated the successful application of domain expertise for spatial interpolation of environmental radioactivity using fuzzy IF-THEN rules, either collected or self-defined. However, their fuzzy rulesets were tailored to specific domains rather than forming a general rule base for spatial dependency extraction. Therefore, there is a need to develop a more general rule-based spatial interpolation framework that can effectively exploit and utilize latent domain knowledge. It is important to note that domain knowledge related to spatial dependency is often difficult to collect and represent in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. Moreover, the lack of standardized approaches to transforming domain knowledge into rule bases limits the effective use of such knowledge. Consequently, it is both necessary and advantageous to systematically and automatically generate fuzzy rulesets to incorporate domain knowledge. Another advantage of rule-based fuzzy inference systems is their ability to tolerate inaccurate information. Observation data and monitoring"}, {"title": "", "content": "records are often subject to errors from various sources [42], which can negatively impact interpolation accuracy. A robust spatial interpolation approach should account for these uncertainties associated with the observed data. Notably, fuzzy logic is well-suited for handling such inherent uncertainties, thereby enhancing the performance of spatial interpolation [43, 44]."}, {"title": "", "content": "In this paper, we present a hybrid framework merging data-driven and domain knowledge for interpolating spatially dependent properties. The framework extracts latent spatial dependency basis by leveraging observation data and neighboring information. By embedding a fuzzy inference system within our adaptive network, we can automatically transform domain knowledge into fuzzy rulesets. This framework capitalizes on the advantages of fuzzy reasoning, particularly its ability to tolerate inaccurate information and manage nonlinear spatially dependent functions. We validate our framework in two scenarios: subsurface formation parameter estimation and air quality mapping. Additionally, we conduct comparative studies to assess the estimation performance quantitatively and qualitatively against conventional interpolation techniques, including ordinary Kriging, inverse distance weighting, and Gaussian process regression."}, {"title": "2. Hybrid data-driven and rule-assisted learning framework", "content": "To address the limitations mentioned above, our framework combines the extraction of spatial dependency features from observation data with the transformation of latent domain knowledge into fuzzy rulesets. For constructing a fuzzy inference system, it is ideal to automatically convert domain knowledge into fuzzy IF-THEN rules. The Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) developed by J.S. Jang [36] provides a solid foundation for this task. However, the number of rules generated by ANFIS can become intractable as the number of input features increases. Specifically, if the number of membership functions assigned to each input dimension is fixed and the dimensionality increases linearly, the number of generated rules grows exponentially. This exponential growth can significantly limit the applicability of ANFIS when incorporating both spatial coordinates and relevant neighboring information as input features. Inspired by ANFIS, we propose an enhanced architecture to overcome this issue by input feature decomposition. As shown in Figure 1, our architecture integrates a data-driven approach with rule-based assistance. The network consists of an intrinsic input layer, a ruleset layer, a T-Norm operation layer, a normalization layer, a consequent layer, and a summation layer. Additionally, it includes a newly designed spatial dependency layer to exploit sparse observation data and their neighboring information. Essentially, our architecture retains the ANFIS learning mechanism for constructing fuzzy IF-THEN rules and approximating the estimation function."}, {"title": "", "content": "The detailed architecture of our hybrid framework is illustrated in Figure 2. It has two main components: 1) data-driven Spatial Dependency Basis (SDB) extraction, and 2) rule-assisted spatial dependency function approximation.

In the following sections, we outline the main steps and their corresponding implementation."}, {"title": "2.1 Spatial Dependency Basis (SDB) extraction", "content": "We apply the reduced-rank approach for obtaining SDB [45].

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the extraction of the SDB begins with constructing nearest neighboring spatial covariates."}, {"title": "2.1.1\nNearest neighboring spatial covariates", "content": "We use nearest neighboring spatial covariates [23, 31], which is the combination of the environmental covariates with the spatial covariates, to comprehensively describe the spatial dependency relationship from spatial observations. Compared to approaches that consider only spatial coordinates as input features, these combined covariates better characterize spatial correlations by fully accounting for spatial coordinates, observation data, and neighboring configurations. The neighboring configurations are established by constructing a neighboring graph for each observation location. We use nearest neighboring algorithm to select the m nearest neighbors for each observation location based on Euclidean distance, see Equation (1).\n$d(i,j) =|| Obs_i \u2014 Obs_j ||_2$\nWhere $Obs_i, Obs_j$ are the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ observed points, respectively. $Obs_i = {x_i, y_i}$ in 2D or ${x_i, y_i, z_i}$ in 3D if necessary. $d(i, j)$ represents the Euclidean distance between $Obs_i$ and $Obs_j$."}, {"title": "2.1.2\nReduced-rank basis extraction", "content": "We use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP [46] to decompose the nearest neighboring spatial covariates into several fixed reduced-rank bases, specifically targeting spatial dependency basis.

Applications", "content": "To evaluate the general applicability and practical performance of the proposed framework, we apply it to two different cases involving the estimation of spatially dependent properties using interpolation of scattered observation data. The first case addresses a classic challenge in subsurface formation characterization [1], where the goal is to estimate the distribution of formation properties, such as rock porosity and/or permeability, based on very scattered observations, and produce a continuous property distribution map for subsurface resource exploitation. This is a particularly relevant use case as only limited observation data are available spatially in general [11, 59]. The second case focuses on estimating the distribution of air pollutants by interpolating data collected from scattered observation stations."}, {"title": "3.1 Spatial interpolation for oil reservoir porosity mapping", "content": "We use an oil reservoir example as a representing case.

The comparative spatial distribution maps of porosity are shown in Figure 11. It is evident that all three traditional methods can reconstruct the global trends and features. Global features here mean the prominent spatial distribution patterns that are easily recognizable across the entire map. These global patterns include the high porosity channel or region in the lower-left diagonal and upper-right direction, as well as the low porosity channel along the diagonal."}, {"title": "", "content": "However, when it comes to capturing spatially local features, all three traditional methods fall short. Local features refer to the finer details and variations within smaller regions that contribute to the overall spatial heterogeneity. The inability of these methods to accurately reconstruct these local features highlights a limitation in their capacity to fully represent complex spatial variability. This comparison underscores the importance of methods that can address both global and local spatial patterns to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the spatial distribution. As demonstrated in Figure 11(d), the circled regions highlight the local features that reflect variations within the porosity field. Compared to other commonly used techniques, our proposed method captures and represents these local features more effectively, providing a more detailed and nuanced depiction of the spatial variability. This enhanced ability to preserve local variations underscores the strength of our approach in handling complex spatial patterns."}, {"title": "", "content": "Similarly, the comparative spatial distribution maps of ozone values are shown in Figure 12.

While they may capture general trends, it often comes at the cost of losing important local variations within the spatial field.

Our proposed method, by contrast, strikes a better balance between capturing global trends and preserving local details, leading to more accurate and nuanced spatial interpolations."}, {"title": "4.3 Sensitive analysis with respect to the number of nearest neighbors", "content": "Although our proposed method offers advantages over traditional techniques in terms of accuracy and the preservation of local features in both cases, its performance in interpolating ozone is slightly less effective compared to its success in reconstructing the porosity field. The primary difference between these two cases is the density of observed data within the interpolation space. The denser data in the porosity field allows for more precise predictions, whereas the sparser data in the ozone case makes it more challenging to capture local variations accurately."}, {"title": "", "content": "Compared to the first porosity field case, the observation density in the ozone case is less uniform than in our randomly selected porosity data. This nonuniform observation density tends to be more sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors m when constructing nearest neighboring spatial covariates in our proposed method.

We choose to use 10 nearest neighbors to achieve the desired accuracy. However, it is important to note that the optimal value of m is highly dependent on the specific observed sampling data. Considerable time and effort are required to carefully tune the hyperparameter m to achieve higher interpolation quality. This tuning process is crucial for adapting the model to different datasets and ensuring reliable interpolation results."}, {"title": "", "content": "Additionally, a larger value of m tends to preserve global spatial patterns, while a smaller value of m tends to emphasize local features. For instance, when m is set to 30, the estimated high-ozone value region in the middle appears more expansive. Conversely, when m is reduced to 5, the results reveal some sparse low-ozone value areas within the high-ozone value region. This occurs because a larger m means that a broader neighborhood is considered when estimating unknown locations, leading to results that are more influenced by higher attribute values within that neighborhood. On the other hand, a smaller m often overlooks the general trend due to its limited neighborhood size, resulting in a focus on local variations. This, however, makes the interpolations more susceptible to outliers or extreme values."}, {"title": "", "content": "Therefore, neither a large nor a small value of m is ideal for constructing nearest neighboring spatial covariates. Careful tuning of the hyperparameter m is essential when implementing our hybrid data-driven and rule-assisted learning framework for spatial interpolation.

Conclusions", "content": "In this study, we develop a hybrid data-driven and rule-assisted learning framework that combines spatial feature extraction with domain knowledge integration via fuzzy rule sets to enhance the interpolation of spatially dependent properties. By decomposing nearest neighbor spatial covariates into multiple spatial dependency bases and utilizing fuzzy IF-THEN rules within an adaptive network framework, our method accommodates imprecise information, considers data uncertainties, and improves spatial interpolation accuracy. Validated through applications in subsurface formation characterization and air quality assessment, our approach surpasses traditional techniques like ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighting, and Gaussian processes by achieving lower error metrics and better capturing local spatial features. However, the method's performance is sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors used, which influences the balance between global trends and local variations. While our approach is parametric and requires careful tuning, future research could explore non-parametric methods that dynamically adjust the number of nearest neighbors, offering a promising avenue for further improving spatial interpolation techniques."}]}

An open question concerns whether data-driven methods enhance outreach programs that target at-risk tenants to mitigate their risk of eviction. We propose a novel active geospatial search (AGS) modeling framework for this problem. AGS integrates property-level information in a search policy that identifies a sequence of rental units to canvas to both determine their eviction risk and provide support if needed. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to learn a search policy for AGS that scales to large urban areas containing thousands of parcels, balancing exploration and exploitation and accounting for travel costs and a budget constraint. Crucially, the search policy adapts online to newly discovered information about evictions. Evaluation using eviction data for a large urban area demonstrates that the proposed framework and algorithmic approach are considerably more effective at sequentially identifying eviction cases than baseline methods.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Evictions can have a profound impact on tenants, causing instability in the rental market and exacerbating the already significant crisis of affordable housing and homelessness in many large urban areas. While the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States was to impose moratoria on evictions at federal, state, and local levels, these have now been lifted. Moreover, most of the $46 billion allocated in housing assistance for low-income households through the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program has now been spent. As a result, eviction rates in the US are rising, with an average of 3.6 million eviction cases filed annually (Gromis et al. 2022; Mar\u00e7al, Fowler, and Hovmand 2023). Eviction concerns are especially acute due to the inequitable impact on marginalized communities. Female, Black, and families with children disproportionately experience eviction (Collinson et al. 2022; Graetz et al. 2023). Exposure to unstable and substandard housing can be particularly hard on children, leading to developmental effects that can follow them for the rest of their lives (Desmond, Gershenson, and Kiviat 2015).\nWhile one way to mitigate the risks and consequences of evictions is through policy, a complementary approach canvasses households at risk of eviction to provide resources to help tenants avoid it. For example, providing information about the availability of effective legal representation can be instrumental, as far fewer tenants than landlords have legal representation in eviction proceedings (Desmond 2016). Legal representation for renters has a significant impact, reducing the likelihood of eviction warrants and possessory judgments while also imposing smaller monetary judgments (Cassidy and Currie 2023; Greiner, Pattanayak, and Hennessy 2013; Seron et al. 2001). In addition, subsidies that help low-income tenants with utility payments (HHS 2023), along with low-income housing programs such as Section 8 vouchers (HUD 2023), can improve their ability to pay rent and avoid eviction. Proactively providing information about these programs can thus also significantly mitigate eviction risk.\nCanvassing tenants at risk of eviction, however, is labor intensive. Canvassers working individually or in teams struggle to reach the vast number of low-income housing units behind on rent. It is, consequently, crucial to make efficient use of such limited resources to provide the maximum benefit possible. However, another important challenge is that we do not know, a priori, the risk of eviction for any given household. We can use past data to learn a predictive model for eviction risk, as demonstrated by Mashiat et al. (2024). However, such predictions can rapidly become stale, and data we can use to train is not equally available everywhere. Thus, we need to effectively use a limited canvassing budget to identify at-risk households while improving the quality of predictions we make in identifying such households. This ultimately necessitates effectively trading off exploration, which allows us to improve predictions of households likely to be evicted and exploitation aimed at reaching the most at-risk households.\nWe introduce a novel active geospatial search (AGS) framework to model this problem. In AGS, an agent (e.g., canvasser) has a limited budget C that can be used to query a series of locations (rental units, buildings) embedded in a geographical area. Each query returns a signal whether or not the location has a target property (an impending eviction, high eviction risk, etc), but incurs a cost which may depend on the previous query (for example, representing travel"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Our work is part of a larger body of literature focusing on geospatial applications of optimization and artificial intelligence in nonprofit and humanitarian domains. This includes developing solutions for collaborative recycling (Hemmelmayr, Smilowitz, and de la Torre 2017), the sequential redistribution of food donations (Balcik, Iravani, and Smilowitz 2014), the routing of disaster relief (de la Torre, Dolinskaya, and Smilowitz 2012), predicting micronutrient deficiency (Bondi-Kelly et al. 2023), and anti-poaching measures (Fang et al. 2016; Fang, Stone, and Tambe 2015; Bondi et al. 2018a, 2020, 2018b; Xu et al. 2020). However, none of these modeling and solution approaches can be directly applied to the AGS framework in mitigating eviction risk through canvassing and information distribution.\nAGS builds on conventional active search, first proposed by Garnett et al.. Previous work in active search has focused on developing nonmyopic algorithms (Jiang et al. 2017b), minimizing the cost to find a given number of examples of the target class (Jiang, Garnett, and Moseley 2019), and extending nonmyopic solutions to multifidelity (Nguyen, Modiri, and Garnett 2021) and multi-class (Nguyen and Garnett 2023) settings. Recently, visual active search (VAS) has been proposed as a variation of active search in which the search region is a satellite image (Sarkar et al. 2022; Sarkar, Jacobs, and Vorobeychik 2023). However, VAS is focused exclusively on visual data and is therefore not directly applicable to AGS.\nGeospatial Applications of Visual Data Geospatial information linked with images has proved useful for the dynamic modeling of traffic (Workman and Jacobs 2020) and the enhancement of near/remote sensing (Workman et al. 2022). The use of imagery as a source of property information is motivated by the work of Lee, Zhang, and Crandall (2015) who use images from Flickr to predict geo-informative attributes of the location being photographed, Gebru et al. (2017) who estimate socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods based on Google Street View images, and Archbold et al. (2023) who develop fine-level estimates of property value at the pixel level from overhead images.\nEviction and Tenant Harassment Prediction Work by Ye et al. (2019) and Mashiat et al. (2024) in the housing domain has shown promise in utilizing machine learning to predict tenant harassment, but lacks the utilization of high-dimensional visual information as well as a sequential decision-making policy. On the other hand, Tabar et al. (2022b) have used satellite imagery data to predict whether a given census tract is an eviction hot spot for the"}, {"title": "Active Geospatial Search for Eviction Prevention", "content": "county in which it sits, but their model yields a high-level picture of eviction risk, with census tracts covering 4,000 people on average. Other efforts to harness data science methods to predict and understand evictions include forecasting the number of tenants at risk of formal eviction in the next month in a census tract (Tabar et al. 2022a), and understanding the predictors of eviction and future eviction hot spots in San Francisco (Tan 2020).\nIn this work, we consider the problem of discovering properties with tenants at risk of an upcoming eviction filing, with the goal of reducing this risk, for example, by providing information about financial and legal resources. We model this as a active geospatial search (AGS) problem. At the high level, AGS involves sequential exploration and discovery, with the ultimate goal of identifying as many locations with a pre-specified target property as possible given limits on time and resources. Formally, a geospatial search task consists of a set of K parcels (e.g., rental buildings) embedded as points in a geographic region. Each parcel i is associated with a feature vector xi as well as a geospatial location li \u2208 R2 (while our focus is on 2D geographic coordinates, generalization to 3D coordinates is immediate). Attributes in xi can include visual data (such as satellite imagery) as well as tabular data (such as the number of units in the building, year built, and so on). Let x = (X1,... Xi,...,xk) aggregate all of this parcel-level attribute information. Each parcel i is also associated with a binary label yi \u2208 {0, 1}, where Yi = 1 iff parcel i has the property of interest (e.g., a likely eviction filing in the near future, for example, over the next three months). Let y = (y1,...,\u0443\u043a) denote the vector of labels over all parcels.\nA central feature of AGS is that at the beginning of the search, we have label information for a subset of parcels obtained, for example, using a recent history of evictions. For the rest, our task amounts to both learning (exploration) and discovery (exploitation). Specifically, we generate a sequence of location queries {qt}, where each qt queries a label yr at location i = qt. Let c(i, j) as the cost associated with querying parcel j when initiating the query process from parcel i. To account for the initial query, we introduce a dummy starting parcel d, where c(d, k) is the initial query cost. Let C be the query budget constraint. The objective of AGS is to identify as many target parcels as we can within the total budget constraint, which we represent as the following optimization problem:\n$\\max_{\\{q_t\\}} \\Sigma Y_{q_t}$\ns.t.: $\\Sigma c(q_{t-1}, q_t) \\le C$\nwhere c(q-1, 90) = c(d, qo) is the cost of the first query."}, {"title": "Proposed Approach", "content": "We begin by considering AGS in a small area; this will provide key building blocks for addressing large-area AGS that we deal with below. Specifically, we propose an approach for learning a search policy from past query results for a"}, {"title": "Small-Area Search", "content": "Suppose that we consider a relatively small geographical area so that the total number of parcels K, and therefore, the number of actions |A| that we need to consider, is relatively small. We propose a RL approach for solving this problem. Specifically, we use the REINFORCE algorithm to directly learn a search policy \u03c8e(x, o, B), where 0 are the parameters of the policy that we learn (Williams 1992).\nIn order to utilize the information we acquire during search, following Sarkar, Jacobs, and Vorobeychik (2023), we propose a search policy comprised of two key components: 1) the prediction module represented by f$(x, 0) and 2) the search module denoted as gr (p, o, B), where & and represent trainable parameters and p = f(x, o) is the vector of predicted eviction probabilities with p\u2081 the predicted"}, {"title": "Large-Area Search", "content": "probability of at least one eviction in parcel index i. Conceptually, fo generates predictions by exclusively considering the task features x and previous search outcomes o, whereas gs depends solely on information pertinent to the search process itself, including the predicted eviction probabilities p, previous search outcomes o, and the remaining budget B. The resulting search policy is a combination of these modules, expressed as \u03c8(x, o, B) = 95 (f\u2084(x, 0), \u03bf, \u0392) (Fig. 1). Throughout the episode, we keep the search module gr fixed, using it to generate a sequence of queries, which inherently incorporates an element of exploration due to the stochastic nature of the policy. As we observe labels yj for each queried parcel j during the episode, we update the prediction function f using binary cross-entropy loss (LBCE). Once the episode concludes (when we have exhausted the search budget C') we update both the search policy parameters and the initial prediction function parameters $. This update involves a combination of RL and supervised loss. In the case of the search module, we calculate the cumulative sum of rewards R = \u2211i yi for the parcels i queried during the episode, and employ the RL loss LRL based on the RE-INFORCE algorithm. For the prediction module, we utilize the collected labels y from the episode and apply LBCE loss. The proposed approach explicitly balances the RL and supervised loss through the loss function:\n$L_{AGS} = \\lambda (L_{RL} + A L_{BCE}).$\nThis ensures that the policy is trained to adapt to the evolving prediction dynamics during the episode. Here is a hyperparameter. A detailed presentation of the complete method is provided in Algorithm 2 in Supplement. During the inference phase, we fix the parameters of the search module \u00c7, and udpate the parameters of the prediction module after each query outcome is observed using the LBCE loss.\nThe key assumption in the approach above is that the number of candidate parcels is relatively small. In practice, that is unrealistic, since even a reasonable target geographical area may contain tens of thousands of parcels. Since the architecture described above requires a policy output per action (parcel), it cannot scale to such problems (see Section ).\nTo address this issue, we propose a hierarchical search framework, Hierarchical AGS (HAGS). The key insight behind HAGS is that we can leverage shared structure-in particular, symmetry and geospatial locality-of the geospatial domain to introduce inductive bias that significantly reduces learning and decision complexity.\nSpecifically, let the geospatial area of interest be comprised of N regions, where each region is, in turn, comprised of (at most) K parcels. This induces a hierarchical decomposition of the area first into regions (first level), and then (within each region) into parcels (second level). In HAGS, the first level of decision making will therefore correspond to choosing a region, while the second will entail choosing a parcel within the selected region. Consequently, a level-1 (higher-level) policy will choose among the N regions, whereas a level-2 policy for each region r will, in turn, choose among the K parcels. For a region r,"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "let Xr = (Xr1,...,xrK) denote the collection of attributes for each parcel in r, and let x = (x1,...,xn) aggregate all of these into a single global feature vector over all regions. Similarly, or is a vector of observed query responses over the parcels in region r, with o combining them into a single global vector.\nIn HAGS, as in our approach for small-area search above, we decompose the search problem into two pieces: 1) a prediction module f(xr, Or) which outputs parcel-level predictions given region-level inputs xr and or, and 2) a hierarchy of search policies, as visualized in Figure 2. The main idea in our HAGS architecture is to leverage geospatial structure by a) learning a single prediction module f(xr, or) with parameters $ shared across both the first and second levels of decision making, and b) learning a single level-2 policy gh\u00b2(xr, or, B) shared by all regions. This introduces an inductive bias, taking advantage of geospatial structure to significantly reduce the number of parameters we need to learn.\nSpecifically, let p = f(x, o) denote predictions for all regions, aggregated from individual region-level predictions, with pri the predicted probability that parcel i in region r has the target property (e.g., an impending eviction proceedings). Let pr = \u2211i pri be the predicted expected number of parcels with the target property in region r ( where i ranges over parcels in region r). Let gh\u00b9 (p, o, B) denote the level-1 policy that outputs a distribution over regions to query next, given inputs p, o (aggregated over all regions) and remaining budget B. Similarly, let gh\u00b2(pr, or, B) be a shared level-2 policy (shared across all regions) that given region-specific inputs pr, or, along with B outputs a distribution over parcels in the associated region. At training time, actions are sampled from these distributions, whereas at search time we choose the action with the highest probability.\nWe jointly train the parameters of the prediction module, as well as both the level-1 and level-2 policies, using the RE-INFORCE policy gradient framework, with the loss function\n$L_{HAGS} = \\lambda (C_{RL} + C_{RL} + A L_{BCE}),$\nwhere Land L are the standard REINFORCE loss functions for level-1 and level-2 policies, respectively, and LBCE the supervised binary cross-entropy loss used to train the prediction module. The RL rewards for the level-2 policies are just as in AGS, that is, 1 if the queried parcel has the target property and 0 otherwise. For level-1 policies, the reward associated with a chosen parcel is 1 if the query according to the level-2 policy within this region yields the target property, and 0 otherwise. Note that LBCE plays an identical role as it did in small-area search AGS framework, that is, we dynamically modify the parameters of the prediction module ($) following the observation of each query outcome both during training and inference. This adjustment is achieved through the utilization of the LBCE loss, which computes the binary cross-entropy loss between the predicted label and the observed label y for the queried parcel. During gradient descent steps, we backpropagate Ch and LBCE through the prediction module and backpropagate Ch through the level-2 policy, updating parameters of both f and the associated search policy.

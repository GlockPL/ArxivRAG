Models like GPT-4 [2], Claude [8], and Gemini [151] have achieved remarkable performance in tasks ranging from natural language understanding to complex reasoning and code generation. The impressive capabilities of these models are largely attributed to their massive scale, both in terms of model parameters and computational resources invested in training. This scaling trend is supported by empirical evidence showing consistent improvements in model performance with increased size, as demonstrated by various scaling laws in language modeling and other domains [5, 19, 74]. However, this trajectory presents significant challenges in terms of computational efficiency and resource utilization, particularly during inference, where real-world deployment constraints become critical [10, 173, 187, 199].\nMixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architectural solution to address scaling challenges in machine learning [137]. Originally introduced by Jacobs et al.[68] in the early 1990s as a method for learning subtasks in neural networks, Numerous MoE-based models [37, 53, 155] have been developed over the years. In the era of large language models, MoE has again experienced a renaissance [1, 29, 70, 148]. The core principle of MoE is to distribute the model's capacity across multiple specialized sub-networks, or experts, with a learned gating mechanism that selectively activates only the relevant experts for each input. This approach allows models to maintain a large parameter count while keeping computational costs manageable through sparse activation. Recent implementations, such as Mixtral 8x7B [70], Switch Transformers [42] and GShard [82], have demonstrated the effectiveness of this strategy in scaling language models to trillions of parameters while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.\nThe success of MoE in scaling models has led to its adoption in various state-of-the-art systems. For example, Google's GLaM [35] outperforms GPT-3 while using significantly fewer computational resources during inference. Similarly, Mixtral 8x7B [70], a recent open-source MoE model, has demonstrated competitive performance compared to much larger dense models, while maintaining efficient inference characteristics. Table 1 summarizes recent state-of-the-art open-source MoE models that have garnered significant attention, further highlighting the strong potential of the MoE architecture. These successes have sparked widespread interest in MoE across both academia and industry, leading to innovations in model design [22, 164, 192], training techniques [34, 47, 101], and deployment strategies [15, 16, 183].\nHowever, the efficient deployment of MoE models for inference presents unique and significant challenges [65, 150, 181, 196]. The dynamic nature of expert activation patterns introduces complexity in resource management and scheduling that is not present in traditional dense models. These challenges span multiple levels: at the model level, the design of efficient expert architectures and routing mechanisms directly impacts inference performance; at the system level, managing distributed computation and load balancing becomes increasingly complex; and at the hardware level, specialized acceleration techniques are needed to handle the sparse computation patterns.\nNumerous methods have been developed to address these challenges in MoE deployment and inference [72, 125, 133, 170]. While the rapid growth of research in this field demonstrates its importance, it can also make it difficult to identify key trends and best practices. A critical gap in existing literature is the absence of a systematic framework for analyzing and developing comprehensive inference optimization solutions for MoE models.\nTo bridge this gap, our work offers a comprehensive survey of inference optimization techniques for MoE models. We propose a taxonomical framework that categorizes optimization approaches into model-level, system-level, and hardware-level optimizations, as illustrated in Figure 1. This framework provides a structured approach to understanding"}, {"title": "2 Fundamentals of Mixture of Experts", "content": "Mixture of Experts (MoE) represents a significant architectural paradigm in neural networks, particularly in large language models, where it enables conditional computation through sparse activation mechanisms [13]. At its core, an MoE architecture consists of a routing network $R(x)$ and a set of expert networks $E_1, E_2, ..., E_N$, where N denotes the total number of experts. The fundamental principle of MoE can be expressed as $y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}g_i(x) \\cdot E_i(x)$, where $g_i(x)$ represents the gating function for expert i, and $E_i(x)$ is the output of expert i.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, existing studies typically use the MoE module to replace part of the traditional dense layer, thereby forming a sparse MoE layer. While most research focuses on substituting the FFN module with the MoE module [1, 30, 70, 71, 153], some have also explored replacing the Attention module [72, 138, 139, 192].\nIn the inference process of a sparse MoE model, computation follows a three-stage pipeline. First, the router computes expert selection probabilities:"}, {"title": "3 Model-level Optimizations", "content": "Model-level optimizations aim to enhance the inherent structure and efficiency of MoE models through systematic improvements in architecture, parameter optimization, and algorithmic design. These optimizations can be broadly categorized into three main areas: efficient model architecture design, model compression techniques, and algorithmic improvements. Architecture design focuses on developing more efficient expert and attention structures, while compression techniques aim to reduce model size and memory footprint through methods such as pruning, quantization,"}, {"title": "3.1 Efficient Model Architecture Design", "content": "A transformer block typically consists of two main components: the attention module and the FFN module. To build better MoE models, many studies focus on designing improved versions of both the attention and FFN modules, aiming to achieve strong performance while maintaining high efficiency.\n3.1.1 MoE-based Attention Design. In addition to the typical application of the MoE structure in the FFN module of transformer layer, current studies explore how to incorporate MoE into the Attention module for improved performance. MAE [121] was the first to explain the multi-head attention mechanism from the MoE perspective, using a learned gating function to activate different experts for different inputs, with each expert consisting of n - 1 heads. To further optimize MoE-based attention modules, existing research proposes various structures. MoA [192] and BAM [190] select"}, {"title": "3.2 Model Compression Techniques", "content": "Model compression is a popular area of research for reducing model size in current LLM studies, with techniques such as pruning [94, 107], quantization [44, 160], knowledge distillation [3, 50], and low-rank decomposition [165, 186]. Since experts constitute the majority of the weights in MoE models (e.g., 96% for Mixtral-8x7B [70]), most MoE-related compression efforts focus on applying these common techniques specifically to the experts.\n3.2.1 Expert Pruning. Due to the large number of parameters in MoE-based models, current research explores pruning methods to reduce the number of parameters in MoE experts. These methods are generally divided into structured and unstructured pruning. Most studies focus on structured expert pruning, which aims to reduce the number of experts in the MoE layer while maintaining model accuracy. As shown in Figure 4-(a), some approaches directly remove unimportant experts (left side), while others merge groups of experts into a single expert (right side). TSEP [18] removes non-professional experts for the target downstream task, while fine-tuning professional experts to preserve model performance. NAEE [103] eliminates unimportant experts by evaluating expert combinations on a small calibration dataset to minimize accuracy loss, while UNCURL [134] reduces the number of experts based on MoE router logits. PEMPE [21] prunes experts that have smaller changes in the router's $l_2$ norm between the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, while SEER-MoE [109] employs a heavy-hitters counting method for expert pruning. And MoE-I\u00b2 [178] proposes the Layer-wise Genetic Search and Block-wise KT-Reception Field with the non-uniform pruning ratio to prune unimportant experts. In addition to direct pruning, some studies utilize expert merging to reduce the number of experts. DEK [193] identifies and groups similar experts in feature space, then merges experts within the same group in weight space to reduce the expert count. EEP [98] introduces a two-stage approach to both prune and merge experts, reducing the total number of experts (saving GPU memory) and the number of active experts (accelerating inference). And MC-SMOE [93] divides experts into different groups based on routing policies and then merges each group into one expert. For unstructured pruning, MoE-Pruner [170] prunes weights with the smallest magnitudes, weighted by"}, {"title": "3.3 Algorithm Optimization", "content": "The core algorithm design of MoE is expert networks, and selecting appropriate granularity sparsity is a prerequisite for effectively utilizing the advantages of MoE. Next, we will fully explore the inference optimization of MoE models from three different strategies.\n3.3.1 Dynamic Gating. Given the significant progress in utilizing the sparsity of MoE models, an important question arises: how can we further leverage this sparsity during inference? Due to the vertical parallel structure of MoE experts, dynamically reducing the number of experts activated for each token clearly presents an effective strategy. Figure 5-(a) illustrates the MoE layer's calculation process after the skip mechanism is applied, in contrast to the original process.\nLi et al. [87] proposes a self-adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically determines the number of experts required for each token, based on the expert probability distribution. This method enhances training efficiency while preserving the sparsity of the MoE model and further reduces training time through curriculum learning. DynMoE [51] introduces two innovative methods for expert activation: the top-down gating method, which allows different tokens to activate varying numbers of experts, and an adaptive process that dynamically adjusts the number of activated experts based on"}, {"title": "4 System-level Optimizations", "content": "Due to the unique structure of MoE, many studies focus on accelerating inference at the system level by leveraging the sparse activation patterns inherent to this architecture. Typically, MoE models are deployed in two scenarios: cloud environments with multiple servers and edge environments with a single device. In cloud clusters, MoE models are distributed across many devices to enable parallel execution. In addition to traditional parallelization techniques such as data parallelism, tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism [69, 110, 126], expert parallelism is a specialized method tailored specifically for MoE models. On edge devices, limited GPU memory often cannot accommodate all parameters"}, {"title": "4.1 Expert Parallelism", "content": "Expert parallelism is a key technique for deploying large MoE models across multiple devices to enable distributed execution. As Figure 7-(a) shown [141], when distributing MoE layers, each device holds a subset of experts along with all other non-expert parameters. In special cases where an expert is very large, each device may contain only one expert. During the execution of an MoE layer, inputs are processed on each device by the attention module and gate module. Subsequently, an all-to-all communication operation redistributes tokens to corresponding devices based on the gate output, allowing each expert to process its assigned inputs. Finally, another all-to-all communication operation occurs to exchange the experts' outputs and send them back to the originating devices. Consequently, the execution time of MoE layers is dominated by two primary phases: computation and communication. To accelerate inference, various studies have proposed optimizations for these phases.\nExisting research focuses on optimizing MoE training and inference performance along four main dimensions: parallel strategies, load balancing, all-to-all communication, and task scheduling.\n4.1.1 Parallelism Strategy Design. In addition to relying solely on expert parallelism [54, 82], recent studies combine multiple parallel strategies to maximize parallelism and achieve more efficient distributed computing. Tutel [64] dynamically switches parallel strategies at each iteration without incurring extra overhead. MoESys [183] employs an elastic MoE training strategy with 2D prefetching and fusion communication over hierarchical storage for efficient parallelism. Alpa [195] automatically derives efficient parallel execution plans at both inter-operator and intra-operator levels. DeepSpeed-TED [143] implements a hybrid parallel algorithm combining data, tensor, and expert parallelism. BaGuaLu [105] integrates MoE and data parallelism to scale models effectively. SmartMoE [189] introduces a two-stage approach to identify optimal parallel strategies for data-sensitive models.\n4.1.2 Load Balancing. Token processing in MoE models can lead to imbalances, where some experts receive significantly more tokens than others. This disparity results in some devices experiencing high overheads while others remain idle, ultimately delaying overall computation. To address this issue, some works propose to add auxiliary loading"}, {"title": "4.2 Expert Offloading", "content": "When deploying MoE models on edge devices, parameter-offloading techniques offer a potential solution to mitigate the challenge of insufficient GPU memory for storing all model parameters. However, traditional parameter-offloading methods load model parameters layer by layer from CPU memory or SSD, neglecting the sparse activation characteristics of MoE models. This oversight incurs significant overhead in parameter loading, leading to suboptimal inference performance. To address this limitation, many studies have proposed expert-offloading techniques, which take advantage"}, {"title": "4.2.1 Expert Prefetching.", "content": "To minimize waiting time for the required experts, some studies focus on optimizing prefetching techniques, which overlap expert loading with GPU computation. Several works predict the experts needed for subsequent layers. For example, MoE-Offloading [38], AdapMoE [196], and HOBBIT [150] use current gating inputs as predictors for the next-layer gating inputs, prefetching the required experts in advance. Pre-gated MoE [65] introduces a pre-gated MoE structure that identifies the experts required by the next layer during the computation of the current layer and preloads them accordingly. EdgeMoE [181] constructs a prediction table using a calibrated dataset, leveraging the current layer experts to predict the next layer's experts. DyNN-Offload [129] trains a pilot model for each layer to predict the required experts for the next layer. MoE-Infinity [176] tracks the request-level usage frequency of each expert and prefetches high-priority experts based on this frequency. ProMoE [144] uses a learned predictor to prefetch experts in a sliding-window manner. Additionally, some works aim to predict all the required experts in the current forward pass in a single step. For instance, ExpertFlow [58] trains a predictor to anticipate all the required experts for the current forward pass and prefetches them in advance. SiDA [36] employs a hash function to predict activated experts for each token in the sequence based on its embedding. Similarly, Read-ME [11] constructs a pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone to predict all required experts at once."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Expert Caching.", "content": "Since GPU memory can hold only a subset of experts (expert cache), optimizing the cache management policy is critical to improving the cache hit ratio and reducing transfer time. Several works [38, 60, 65, 181, 184] adopt the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy, as recently used experts are more likely to be accessed again. In contrast, MoE-Infinity [176] employs a Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy due to its request-level tracking capability. Fiddler [73] maintains the most critical experts in GPU memory using a static dataset-based approach, whereas SwapMoE [79] dynamically updates the most important experts. AdapMoE [196] introduces a dynamic cache size for different model layers, driven by its adaptive gating algorithm. Meanwhile, HOBBIT [150] proposes a multidimensional cache policy combining LRU, LFU, and a novel Least High Precision Used (LHU) strategy for its mixed-precision expert cache."}, {"title": "4.2.3 Expert Loading.", "content": "Expert loading time often constitutes the primary bottleneck in expert-offloading inference. To address this, some works aim to directly reduce loading costs. EdgeMoE [181] and HOBBIT [150] reduce loading time by using low-precision experts instead of high-precision ones. EdgeMoE determines expert precision by profiling their importance on a dataset, while HOBBIT dynamically selects suitable precision for cache-missing experts based on current inputs. AdapMoE [196] employs an adaptive gating algorithm to skip less important experts, further lowering expert loading costs."}, {"title": "4.2.4 CPU Assisting", "content": "Beyond relying solely on the GPU for computation, some approaches leverage the CPU to assist.

These optimizations target critical issues such as operations per byte (Op/B) efficiency, heterogeneous computing units, and memory access patterns. The following discusses significant advances in hardware-level solutions. MONDE [76] introduces a near-data processing (NDP) solution to address the challenges of sparse activation and expert parameter transmission overhead (Fig. 8). The architecture integrates CXL (Compute Express Link)-based NDP controllers with specialized NDP cores for in-memory computation, utilizing LPDDR SDRAM (low power double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory) for high bandwidth and energy efficiency. The system implements a hybrid computing strategy where GPUs handle frequently accessed \"hot\" experts while NDP units process \"cold\" experts, enabling concurrent execution through an Activation Movement paradigm rather than traditional Parameter Movement.\nFLAME [97] is the first MoE accelerating framework which fully exploits MoE sparsity for transformer on FPGA. At the parameter level of the model, it utilizes M:N pruning to reduce unnecessary calculations, which can make balance between column balanced structured pruning and unstructured pruning; At the expert level, sparse activation prediction is performed through CEPR(circular expert prediction). By changing the patterning of activation path of experts, the accuracy of expert predictions can be effectively improved. Then use a double buffering mechanism to load the predicted expert while computing the previous expert to improve expert deployment efficiency.\nM\u00b3ViT [40] and Edge-MoE [133] constructed their FPGA architecture based on the reordering if attention computation in multitasking scenarios. For inference, M\u00b3ViT can activate only the sparse \"expert\u201d pathway relevant to the task of interest for efficiency, and can further achieve zero-overhead switching between tasks with their hardware-level co-design. Edge-MoE is the first end-to-end FPGA implementation for multi-task ViT proposed some aggressive techniques, including an approximate method for solving the excessive complexity of GELU function calculation on FPGA and a unified linear layer module to achieve efficient reuse of hardware resource.\nDuplex [188] selects a destination suitable for each layer execution in the device that combines xPU and Logic PIM (processing-in-memory). that's means it could integrate two types of processing units that share device memories.

These dimensions are interconnected: advances in infrastructure enable better system properties, while development tools accelerate progress in both areas."}, {"title": "6.1 Computing Infrastructure Optimization", "content": "6.1.1 Hardware Integration and Acceleration. The efficient execution of MoE models demands novel hardware architectures and acceleration strategies that go beyond traditional computing paradigms [40, 119, 133, 188]. Current hardware platforms, optimized primarily for dense computations, often struggle to efficiently handle the sparse and dynamic nature of MoE workloads [147, 182, 197]. This necessitates the development of specialized hardware solutions that can better support the unique computational patterns of MoE inference.\nTraditional hardware optimization presents several immediate opportunities for improvement. The development of specialized circuits for expert routing and activation could significantly reduce the overhead of dynamic expert selection. Memory hierarchies optimized for sparse parameter access could better support the irregular access patterns characteristic of MoE computation. Furthermore, the implementation of efficient hardware support for dynamic workload patterns could enhance the overall system performance.\nEmerging hardware platforms offer exciting new possibilities for MoE acceleration. Neuromorphic computing systems [135, 136], with their inherent support for sparse, event-driven computation, could provide natural acceleration for expert activation patterns. Quantum computing platforms [95, 116, 145] might enable novel approaches to complex routing decisions, though significant challenges remain in effectively bridging classical and quantum computations. The integration of novel memory technologies could also provide more efficient storage and access patterns for expert parameters.\n6.1.2 System Software Optimization. The optimization of the system software stack presents significant challenges for MoE models due to their unique computational patterns and resource requirements.

As AI systems continue to scale and their environmental impact becomes more significant, there is a pressing need to consider energy consumption and carbon emissions as primary optimization objectives alongside traditional performance metrics [6, 25, 59, 106, 127].\nThe energy consumption patterns of MoE models present unique challenges due to their sparse activation patterns and distributed nature. While sparse activation theoretically reduces computational demands, the overhead from expert routing, communication, and load balancing can lead to significant energy costs [64, 112, 141]. Current hardware platforms, often optimized for dense computations, result in suboptimal energy efficiency when handling the dynamic workloads characteristic of MoE inference [114, 200]. Additionally, the distributed nature of many MoE deployments introduces substantial energy overhead from data movement and communication.\nCarbon-aware deployment strategies represent an important direction for future research [39, 46, 124]. In distributed settings, expert placement and workload distribution decisions should consider not just computational resources but also the carbon intensity of different data centers' power sources. This could involve developing dynamic scheduling algorithms that preferentially route computation to locations with access to renewable energy.

Unlike traditional neural networks with fixed computation patterns, MoE models exhibit variable execution paths and resource requirements, making it difficult to provide consistent latency guarantees and maintain high availability [28, 176].\nPredictable expert activation and routing represent a fundamental challenge. The input-dependent nature of expert selection can lead to significant variability in processing time and resource utilization. Research is needed to develop techniques that can better predict and manage this variability, potentially through advanced caching strategies, workload characterization, and adaptive routing algorithms [58, 144, 196]. This includes methods for balancing the trade-off between routing accuracy and computational overhead.\nSystem reliability and fault tolerance require particular attention in distributed MoE deployments [14]. The failure of individual experts or communication links can significantly impact system performance and model quality. Research opportunities include developing robust failure detection and recovery mechanisms, implementing graceful degradation strategies, and designing redundancy schemes that balance reliability with resource efficiency.

Current evaluation practices often vary significantly across studies, making it difficult to perform fair comparisons and assess the relative merits of different optimization approaches. This fragmentation in evaluation methodologies impedes the systematic progress of the field and complicates the adoption of optimization techniques in practical applications.\nA standardized benchmarking framework should encompass multiple dimensions of MoE inference optimization. This includes performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization, as well as model quality metrics across different tasks and domains. The framework should also consider various deployment scenarios, from edge devices to large-scale distributed systems, and different hardware configurations. Furthermore, standardized workload patterns that reflect real-world usage scenarios are essential for meaningful evaluation of optimization techniques.\nThe development of such benchmarking standards presents several challenges. The dynamic nature of MoE models, where different inputs may activate different experts, makes it difficult to establish consistent performance measurements. The trade-offs between various optimization objectives (e.g., latency vs. throughput, or quality vs. efficiency) need to be carefully balanced in the evaluation criteria.

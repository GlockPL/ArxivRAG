Introduction", "content": "More than half of the global population currently resides in urban areas, and this figure is projected to reach 68% by 2050 [1]. As cities grow in scale due to rapid urbanization and economic expansion [2][3], urban morphology increasingly influences microclimates and exacerbates challenges like the urban heat island effect [4]. This makes urban form a critical factor in high-density development, drawing attention from architects and urban planners [5]. Urban morphology-encompassing the form, layout, and density of buildings and urban blocks\u2014directly affects shading, solar access, wind patterns, and heat retention, all of which impact energy consumption and environmental performance [6][7]. As a result, urban form is central to sustainable development [8][9].\nTo create sustainable urban environments, it is essential to integrate energy considerations into urban planning and design [10]. Urban energy planning guides human settlements\u2014from neighborhoods to entire cities\u2014toward a more sustainable future by assessing the potential impacts of design choices on energy consumption [11][12]. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) enables large-scale energy assessments, accounting for the interactions between buildings and their surroundings [13][14][15]. However, incorporating multiple urban morphology"}, {"title": "2. Literature review", "content": "parameters such as building height, density, and orientation\u2014into energy planning presents challenges due to the complexity of their interactions [16][13].\nIn dry-arid climates, incorporating energy considerations into urban planning is crucial due to high temperatures, intense solar radiation, and minimal rainfall. In these regions, inadequate planning can lead to increased temperatures and a greater reliance on HVAC systems for thermal comfort [17]. In Iran, specifically, climate and energy considerations have received limited attention in national urban planning efforts [18]. This study examines the effects of urban morphology on energy consumption and environmental performance, adopting Tehran, Iran, as a representative case. Tehran's range of high-density cores and lower-density areas serves as a useful model for analyzing diverse urban configurations typical of other cities in similar dry-arid climates. This range enables an analysis that encompasses both dense urban patterns and mixed structures, supporting findings applicable to various urban fabrics in dry-arid climates. Previous studies have primarily focused on either broad (national) or small (building) scales, leaving a gap in understanding urban morphology's impact at the urban block level. Moreover, global studies have shown that the effects of urban form on energy metrics are context-specific, making it challenging to generalize findings across different cities [19][17]. Tailored research is needed to explore these relationships in more detail.\nThis study explores the relationship between urban morphology and energy metrics\u2014specifically cooling, heating, and lighting energy consumption\u2014at the urban block scale, with the findings intended to inform urban planning broadly. In addition to energy metrics, environmental performance metrics such as sunlight hours on fa\u00e7ades, photovoltaic (PV) power generation, and Sky View Factor (SVF) are assessed. Through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, the study examines both typical urban parameters and the heights and distances of surrounding buildings."}, {"title": "2.1. Sensitivity analysis in UBEM", "content": "Urban form and morphology play a critical role in building energy performance and environmental outcomes. Numerous studies across different climates have explored these relationships. For instance, Zhang and Gao [21] evaluated the effect of urban form on micro-climate and energy at the block scale in Nanjing, China, finding that energy loads can vary by 23.4% when the microclimate effect is ignored. Similarly, Shang and Hou [3] demonstrated that non-optimal building arrangements can result in a 30% increase in energy consumption for offices and 19% for housing, highlighting the influence of surrounding buildings on energy use. It was then recommended to consider urban form parameters (e.g., building shape, density, green ratio, rotation, street geometry, SVF) at the early design stage to minimize energy demand. Samuelson et al. [22] emphasized the need to account for the urban context in energy simulations, as overlooking surrounding buildings can lead to errors in energy estimates, with generalized contexts producing smaller errors (0-11%) compared to entirely ignoring the context (8-31%). Leng et al. [23] further demonstrated that considering surrounding buildings can lead to a 16-18% reduction in cooling loads in warm, humid climates, underscoring the role of urban morphology in influencing energy consumption. Street geometry and rotation also influence local thermal comfort and energy consumption [24][25]. Yu et al. [26] and Mangan et al. [27] identified building height, floor area ratio (FAR), and building coverage ratio as the most influential factors on energy performance, in temperate-humid climates. Yu et al. [26] found that higher FAR and building"}, {"title": "2.2. Modeling approaches", "content": "A further contribution to knowledge offered by this study lies in its holistic approach, integrating multiple metrics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how urban form influences microclimates, shading, and energy efficiency. While SVF and solar access are often viewed as intermediate variables, their inclusion here as performance metrics underscores their critical role in shaping microclimates and indirectly influencing energy consumption. Additionally, this study leverages machine learning models (MLMs) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to conduct a detailed sensitivity analysis, setting it apart from previous studies [20] that have used more conventional methods. By employing these advanced tools, the analysis achieves a higher degree of transparency and interpretability, allowing for a clearer identification of influential variables. Additionally, by analyzing building height and distance from adjacent buildings as separate indicators, this study offers more granular insights into their specific contributions to energy and environmental outcomes. To guide the research, the following questions are addressed:\n1. How do urban morphology parameters\u2014such as building shape, height, and density\u2014\naffect energy consumption metrics (cooling, heating, lighting) and environmental\nperformance metrics (sunlight hours on fa\u00e7ades, PV power generation, and SVF)?\n2.

Using MLMs and SHAP in UBEM", "content": "A decade ago, city-scale simulations were impossible due to computational and data collection challenges [39]. Recent studies have developed various methods and tools to facilitate modeling and simulation at the urban scale. Current UBEM workflows automatically generate thermal models from 3D building models and archetype attributes, allowing the simulation under specific climatic conditions [10]. Physics-based UBEM models use heat and mass balance equations for spatial and temporal resolution [9]. Swan and Ugursal [40] classified UBEM methodologies into top-down and bottom-up approaches and Kavgic et al. [41] focusing on the latter. In fact, since 2018, bottom-up approaches have gained more attention, leading to new studies [42]. Top-down models use aggregate data to relate energy consumption to factors like socio-economic conditions [1][43]. These models are effective for large-scale analyses but lack granularity, as they treat groups of buildings as units, making them unsuitable for detailed neighborhood-specific energy assessments [9]. Additionally, top-down models often fail to account for the unique characteristics of individual buildings, leading to less accurate energy consumption estimates [44].\nIn contrast, bottom-up models estimate individual building energy consumption using extensive disaggregated data [10]. They use detailed engineering (white-box), reduced-order (gray-box), or data-driven statistical or MLMs (known as black-box), providing granular analysis but requiring significant data and computational resources [15][45]. Therefore, this study will utilize a bottom-up approach to comprehensively analyze urban energy consumption at the block scale, because it allows for detailed and accurate assessment of individual building characteristics and their interactions with the urban environment.\nRecent advancements in ML have increasingly facilitated decision-making in UBEM [46]. One notable method is SHAP, which assigns values to features based on their contribution to target predictions [47][48]. SHAP has been employed in various studies to evaluate factors influencing energy consumption [49][50], thermal comfort [51][52], urban heat island [53][54], as well as in the development of tools for building performance analysis [50][55]. For instance, Yu et al. [53] applied SHAP with XGBoost to study the impact of landscape patterns on land surface temperature, finding that 3D landscape metrics were effective in explaining temperature variations. Additionally, Kim et al. [56] identified built-up areas and surrounding vegetation as key factors affecting surface temperature predictions, while Meddage et al. [57] used SHAP to explore the positive and negative effects of geometric parameters on wind pressure in urban settings. Shen and Pan [55] developed a tool for building energy performance assessment using SHAP, Design Builder, and Bayesian optimization LightGBM components [55]. Similarly, Shams Amiri et al. [58] demonstrated the effectiveness of SHAP in forecasting building energy usage and analyzing the impact of urban planning decisions. Given the potential of ML and SHAP in UBEM, this study"}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "leverages these tools to investigate how urban morphology impacts energy consumption and environmental performance metrics.\nThe literature reveals several key trends in UBEM. First, incorporating the urban context\u2014particularly the heights and distances of neighboring buildings\u2014is crucial for accurately assessing environmental performance metrics, even when focusing on individual buildings. Neglecting the impact of surrounding structures can result in significant errors in energy and environmental predictions. While energy performance has been extensively explored in various climates, recent studies highlight the need for more holistic analyses. Metrics such as solar hours received on fa\u00e7ades and SVF are increasingly being recognized for their roles in influencing daylight access, microclimate regulation, and outdoor comfort. These factors contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how urban morphology impacts not only energy use but also broader aspects of livability and environmental sustainability.\nLastly, the literature emphasizes the importance of context-specific analyses, as many metrics are highly dependent on local climate and urban conditions. Although this study focuses on Tehran's dry-arid climate, the methodology and insights can be applied to other regions seeking to optimize urban design for energy and environmental performance. By integrating MLMs and SHAP, this research aims to advance understanding of how urban form influences a range of performance metrics in a more interpretable and comprehensive manner.\nThe research methodology comprises three steps: (1) Performance Simulation at Urban Level:\nparametric modeling of various inputs such as urban block length, street width, FAR, building\ncoverage ratio, rotation, buildings height and distances and the simulation of energy consumption"}, {"title": "3.1. Performance Simulation at Urban Level", "content": "metrics, the number of hours of sunlight received by building facades, photovoltaic power generation and SVF as outputs. (2) Building of Predictive Models: multiple predictive models were constructed to forecast the desired output, and the efficacy of each machine learning algorithm was evaluated. (3) Integration of Shapley Values for Feature Importance Assessment: SHAP analysis technique was employed for sensitivity analysis to identify the most influential features, thereby enhancing the understanding of the underlying relationships between the variables and the outputs.\nDue to the variation in building heights and street widths in the urban context, a series of urban blocks have been developed. These blocks were modeled according to the typical climate and configuration observed in Tehran, Iran (35.6892\u00b0N, 51.3890\u00b0E). The Rhino environment, Grasshopper, and plugins such as Ladybug, Dragonfly and Honeybee version 1.6.0 have been employed for the modeling and simulation of urban blocks. In the energy modeling section, the primary EPW weather file was modified using the Urban Weather Generator (UWG) plugin to account for local microclimate conditions. This adjustment is crucial since urban climate, influenced by city structure, block texture, building form, and open space arrangement, affects building cooling and heating loads, thermal comfort, and overall performance. Accurate weather data is essential for precise thermal energy demand modeling [10][59]. By incorporating local weather data (e.g., temperature, wind speed, solar radiation), we ensure that the boundary conditions of the urban environment, a key input for building energy modeling, are accurately represented.\nThe modeling is parametrically conducted on a regular grid, with buildings between 3 and 10 floors, each floor measuring 3.5 meters high.

Building prediction models", "content": "significance in influencing energy consumption and environmental performance, as identified in previous research. Key parameters such as site dimension, street width, building typology, FAR, and building coverage ratio directly affect the urban form and spatial arrangement of blocks, which in turn influence shading, solar exposure, and airflow [3] [26]. Building dimensions, including width, length, and height, were calculated post-modeling to ensure that their impact on metrics was captured comprehensively. Additionally, the heights and distances of neighboring buildings were treated as separate variables, as research has shown that both factors significantly affect shading and solar access [22][28]. Some parameters, such as WWR, construction materials, and internal loads, were held constant across scenarios to focus on urban morphology variables, as these have been identified as the primary drivers of energy performance at the urban block scale [28]. This approach ensures that the study emphasizes the critical urban form parameters while maintaining a consistent modeling environment for valid comparison across scenarios.\nWith this framework established, the analysis begins with an examination of two distinct building typologies: rectangular and L-shaped designs. Rectangular buildings are the most prevalent in Iran and were selected to represent common local building fabrics, essential for understanding energy performance. While traditional courtyard houses are also common, they have been well explored in previous studies in Iran [60][61][17]. The less common L-shaped designs were chosen for their unique geometric characteristics, providing insights into optimizing modern architectural forms. The selected building types aim to enhance the overall understanding of diverse building designs within the local context and their implications for energy efficiency.\nAs detailed in Table 2, the minimum area for an urban block is 1 hectare (100 meters by 100 meters). Street widths follow the specifications of Tehran's master urban plan, with internal block access streets measuring 6 and 12 meters, and main streets set at 20 meters.

Table 4 breakdowns the tuned MLM hyperparameters utilized in this study. This tuned set of hyperparameters ensures the robustness and effectiveness of the CatBoost algorithm in capturing complex patterns within the data while generalizing well to unseen instances.\nTo assess the performance of models, specific evaluation metrics are applied. For outputs derived from regression models, R\u00b2 is employed as one of the standard metrics for evaluating the quality of these models. This metric represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables within the model. A value of R\u00b2 closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The formula for calculating R\u00b2 is as follows (Equation 1):\nR2 = 1 \u2212 \\frac{SSR}{SST} (1)\nwhere:\n\u2022 SSR (Sum of Squares of Residuals): The sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.\n\u2022 SST (Total Sum of Squares): The sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the mean of the observed values.\nThis index alone may not adequately represent the overall quality of a model, particularly in terms of its ability to accurately predict new data. Therefore, it is advisable to utilize additional metrics, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), to assess predictive accuracy [69][70]. RMSE quantifies the closeness of the predicted values to the actual values (Equation 2). A lower RMSE indicates superior model performance.\nRMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i} - \\hat{Y}_{i})^{2}} (2)\nwhere:\n\u2022 N: The number of data.\n\u2022  \\hat{Y_{i}}:The predicted value.\n\u2022  Y_{i}:The observed (or simulated) value.\nIn addition to R2 and RMSE, another metric used to evaluate model performance is training time. This metric reflects the computational efficiency of each algorithm, with a lower training time indicating faster model training."}, {"title": "4.2.SHAP analysis results", "content": "This section presents an evaluation of the predictive accuracy of MLMs used to estimate key energy and environmental metrics, followed by an analysis of urban morphology parameters' influence on these metrics. First, the predictive performance of the MLMs is assessed for accuracy and reliability.

The evaluation of predictive models is critical for gauging their effectiveness in capturing underlying data patterns. The R\u00b2 serves as a key metric to quantify the proportion of variance in the output variable explored by the model. Higher R\u00b2 values indicate a stronger predictive performance and a closer alignment between the predicted and observed values.\nIn the prediction of PV power generation, RF achieves an R2 value of 0.969, indicating that approximately 0.96 of the variances in PV power output is captured by the model. Similarly, RF exhibits R2 values of 0.87 for cooling, 0.89 for heating, and 0.9 for lighting energy consumption. While other models, such as CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, also demonstrate strong performance, they generally exhibit slightly lower R2 values across these outputs. For instance, XGBoost achieves an R2 value of 0.97 for PV power generation, slightly higher than the value obtained by RF, but it records R\u00b2 values of 0.82 for cooling, 0.85 for heating, and 0.88 for lighting energy consumption. CATboost and LightGBM models exhibit R\u00b2 values slightly lower than those of RF and XGboost in forecasting cooling and heating demand, and lighting consumption. In contrast, ANN, KNN, and SVM consistently display lower predictive performance across the majority of outputs. For instance, ANN, KNN, and SVM achieve R\u00b2 values of only 0.23, 0.43, and 0.21, respectively, for PV power generation, highlighting their limited ability to capture the complex relationships in this output.

The LightGBM algorithm consistently exhibits higher RMSE values across outputs compared to other models. In contrast, the RF algorithm shows lower RMSE values for predicting energy metrics compared to XGBoost and CATBoost. However, for metrics such as sunlight hours received on facades, SVF, and PV power generation metrics, the XGBoost algorithm outperforms both RF and CATBoost.\nIn summary, while the models exhibit varying levels of predictive accuracy across different outputs, RF demonstrates superior performance, as indicated by its high R\u00b2 values across all outputs. However, in terms of RMSE, the XGBoost algorithm shows generally lower RMSE values. Therefore, to provide a comprehensive evaluation and aid the decision-making, this paper examines the model training times. Figure 4 displays the average R\u00b2 value of each model along with their respective training times.\nThe CATBoost model requires the longest training time at 133.78 seconds, while the KNN model has the shortest time at 0.05 seconds.

The variable with the largest influence on each metric is displayed in the darkest color (dark blue). Variables are ranked according to their cumulative ranks across all metrics, with those having the highest total ranks placed at the top. Variables marked with N/A are influential in the sensitivity analysis but did not demonstrate statistical significance.\nFigure 5 provides an analysis of the relationships between 30 input variables and 6 output metrics, illustrating the direction and nature of influence each variable has on these metrics. The relationships are represented using arrows to indicate the type of influence: direct (\u2191), inverse (\u2193), or complex (\u2191). A direct relationship (\u2191) suggests that increasing/decreasing the variable leads to an increase/decrease in the metric, while an inverse relationship (\u2193) implies that increasing/decreasing the variable causes a decrease/increase in the metric. In some cases, the relationship between a variable and a metric is complex in both directions (whether the variable increases or decreases), represented by a \u2191 arrow, meaning it can vary in a non-linear or unpredictable manner. However, in other cases, the relationship is complex in only one direction: the effect is clear when the variable changes in one direction but becomes complex when it changes in the opposite direction. To distinguish these one-way complex relationships, the table uses colored borders: Red borders indicate that increasing the variable has a clear influence (either direct or inverse), but decreasing it results in a complex relationship. Yellow borders indicate that decreasing the variable has a clear influence, but increasing it results in a complex relationship. This color-coding helps to clarify which variables exhibit predictable effects in one direction while having complex, less predictable effects in the opposite direction, providing a more detailed"}, {"title": "4.2.2. Cooling energy demand", "content": "understanding of the relationships between the variables and the metrics. For instance, building length consistently shows a direct relationship (\u2191) with the number of hours of received sunlight. However, when increasing this variable, it also exhibits a direct relationship (\u2191) with heating energy. On the other hand, decreasing the building length has a complex relationship (\u2191) with heating energy.\nThe number of stories has the most significant impact as it directly increases the surface area of the building envelope exposed to sunlight. Building length follows with an influence of 73.5%, as longer buildings provide a larger facade surface, increasing sunlight exposure. Building area, with a 66.35% effect, also plays a crucial role since larger building envelopes capture more sunlight. Building width, contributing 50.8%, affects sunlight hours similarly by expanding the building's exposed surface area. As these values increase, the number of hours of sunlight the building receives also increases.\nIn the category of influential variables, the density of buildings within the urban plot displays an inverse relationship with sunlight hours, showing a 45.36% effect. Higher density reduces surface exposure to sunlight as buildings become more crowded. The heights of neighboring buildings, particularly in the southwest and southeast, have a moderate influence, with 24.58% and 24.01% effects respectively. These exhibit an inverse relationship with the metric, indicating that taller buildings in these positions provide shading, thereby reducing sunlight exposure. Proximity to adjacent buildings also plays a role; the distances from buildings in the southeast and southwest contribute 23.06% and 21.7%, respectively, to the variation in sunlight hours, reducing these distances increases the sunlight hours on facades. A reduction in street width, with a 21.3% effect, can lead to an increase in sunlight hours received on facades, which can be attributed to the modeling approach: narrower streets result in larger plot areas, thus expanding the building envelope area. Similarly, the height of the right (eastern) adjacent building impacts sunlight, with a 20.18% effect, as taller neighboring structures in this position also cast shadows and reduce sunlight hours.\nNegligible variables, with less than 20% influence, include factors such as the height of western adjacent buildings and the distance from eastern buildings. These variables have minimal or inconsistent effects on sunlight hours. Additionally, factors like building usage, the height and distance of northern, northwest, and northeast neighboring buildings, as well as the shape of the building (with rectangular buildings receiving more sunlight than L-shaped ones), are categorized as having negligible impact on the sunlight received by facades.\nCommercial ratio is the most dominant factor affecting cooling energy consumption. Commercial buildings generally consume more energy for cooling due to higher occupancy levels and different usage patterns compared to office and residential buildings. The shape of the building, with an impact of 94.1%, also plays a crucial role, as L-shaped buildings have a larger surface area exposed to sunlight, leading to increased heat gain and cooling demand. Another critical factor is WWR, with an 80.73% effect, is another critical factor, where larger windows permit more sunlight to enter, thus increasing the cooling energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures.\nSeveral variables exhibit moderate effects on cooling energy consumption. The southwest building distance, with an influence of 42.18%, is particularly important; reducing this distance increases cooling energy due to increased exposure to the afternoon sun. The density of buildings, with a 35.83% effect, generally has an inverse relationship with cooling energy, as higher density lowers the surface area-to-volume ratio, reducing heat gain. Similarly, building width (29.25%) and building area (27.89%) show moderate effects, where larger building dimensions reduce heat gain and cooling energy needs. The green space ratio, with a 25.9% impact, is another key factor, as increased green space can lower ambient temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration,"}, {"title": "4.2.3.

Some neighborhood characteristics, such as the height of the southwest neighboring building, with a 21.77% influence, an inverse relationship with cooling energy, as taller buildings can provide shading that reduces cooling needs. The number of stories (21.54%) also contributes to cooling energy demand by increasing the surface area exposed to solar radiation.\nThe following variables have a negligible impact on cooling energy demand, as their effects are less than 20%. These include the northwest building distance and north building distance, both with a 19.73% influence, as well as the distances from the southeast at 17.91% and west at 17.01%. While proximity to nearby structures can influence cooling demand to a small extent, these factors do not significantly affect the overall energy consumption due to the minimal shading and solar exposure changes they cause. Additionally, site length (10.43%), building length (10.43%), and the height of the southeast building, along with the height of adjacent buildings in the east. These variables have minimal effects on cooling energy consumption. Although the southwest building distance has a somewhat greater influence, variations in the height of adjacent buildings, particularly in the south and northwest, are less impactful. This indicates that proximity to structures and open spaces plays a more important role in cooling energy demand than building height.\nIn conclusion, changes in adjacent distances, such as dSW, have a larger impact on cooling energy compared to variations in building height, suggesting that proximity to other structures and open spaces is more important than vertical dimensions.\nBuilding shape is the most critical factor. Rectangular buildings generally require less heating energy than L-shaped buildings due to their compact form, which minimizes heat loss. The number of commercial floors, with an 81.27% influence, also plays a significant role, as commercial buildings typically require more heating due to their larger spaces and higher energy demands. The WWR, with a 74.6% effect, shows a direct relationship with heating energy demand, as larger windows allow more heat loss. Additionally, building area contributes 51.75%, indicating that larger buildings tend to lose more heat and require additional energy for heating.\nSeveral variables are influential, showing a moderate impact on heating energy demand. Building width, with an influence of 36.19%, exhibits an inverse relationship with heating demand-wider buildings retain more heat, thus reducing the need for heating. Density also demonstrates an inverse relationship, contributing 27.87%, as denser building configurations trap more heat, lowering energy consumption. The height of the southwest building has an impact of 26%, where taller buildings can obstruct sunlight, increasing heating demand. Additionally, the distance to the eastern building, with a 25.3% effect, shows an inverse relationship, where reduced distance decreases exposure to cold winds and lowers heating energy needs."}, {"title": "4.2.4.

The height of the adjacent building to the left (west), with an effect of 14.92%, is directly related to heating energy consumption, as reducing the height of this building increases heating needs due to diminished solar gain. The south building height, with a 14.92% influence, also exhibits a complex relationship, where its effect on heating demand depends on the interactions with sunlight and shading. Similarly, building rotation affects heating energy consumption in a complex way, impacting the heat gain and loss depending on the orientation of the building. Furthermore, the northwest building distance, with a 14.6% influence, shows an inverse relationship with heating energy demand, where reducing this distance decreases heating needs due to improved thermal insulation from adjacent structures. The northeast building distance, at 13.65%, exhibits a more complex relationship.\nThe most dominant variables influencing lighting energy demand are building shape and the number of commercial floors, with an 85.71% effect. Rectangular buildings typically require more lighting energy compared to L-shaped buildings due to reduced natural light penetration in deeper spaces, increasing reliance on artificial lighting. The WWR also plays a critical role, with a 77.71% influence, where larger windows allow more natural light to enter, reducing lighting energy consumption. The number of stories, with a 67.43% effect, further contributes to lighting energy demand, as taller buildings may face challenges in distributing natural light evenly across all floors. The number of commercial floors, at 47.4%, directly impacts lighting energy due to the typically commercial spaces requiring more artificial lighting.\nSeveral influential variables also contribute to lighting energy demand. Building area (38.5%), building width (31.14%), and density (30.57%) play a moderate role, where larger and denser buildings tend to have uneven natural light distribution, leading to greater reliance on artificial lighting. The southwest building distance, with an impact of 27.7%, influences lighting energy needs, as increasing the distance to the southwest building allows more natural light into the building. Conversely, the height of the right (East) adjacent building, at 26.57%, tends to increase lighting energy consumption due to potential obstruction of natural light. Additionally, the"}, {"title": "4.2.5. Energy generated by Photovoltaic panels", "content": "northeast building distance, as well as the heights of the southwest and south buildings, each with a 23.14% impact, exhibit complex influences; however, reducing the height of these neighboring structures generally allows more natural light to penetrate, thereby decreasing lighting energy needs. The southeast building height and the left (west) adjacent building height, both at 20.86%, also affect lighting energy demand, as lower building heights in these positions allow more natural light to enter.\nLastly, several variables are considered negligible. These include the distance to the west and northwest buildings, site length, green space ratio, and the heights of the east and northwest buildings, which were found to have minimal impact on lighting energy demand. Additionally, street width, building footprint, and the heights of the west and northeast buildings, along with building length, were determined to have the least influence on lighting energy consumption and can therefore be deprioritized in further analysis.\nThe dominant variables influencing PV energy generation are building area and building shape, contributing 84.83%. Rectangular buildings typically generate less PV energy compared to L-shaped buildings due to their smaller roof area. In all scenarios, 40% of the available roof area is allocated for PV panels, but L-shaped buildings"}]}

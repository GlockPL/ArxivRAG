Of course, not every formula is intuitively\nacceptable as an explanation which is why there are usually\nsome restrictions on \u03c6. In particular, \u0393\u222a{$} should be con-\nsistent, \u03c6 should not entail x by itself nor contain atoms not\noccurring in \u0393\u222a{$}, \u03c6 should be syntactically restricted\nso as to be easily understandable, and \u03c6 should constitute a\nweakest possible (or minimal) explanation, cf. discussion in\n(Marquis 2000, \u00a74.2) or (Aliseda 2006, \u00a73.3). Most com-\nmonly, the third desiderata is enforced by requiring abduc-\ntive solutions to take the form of terms (conjunctions of liter-\nals), in which case the logically weakest solutions are simply\nthe subset-minimal ones.\nNote, however, that in classical propositional logic (CPL)\nany contradictory theory is inconsistent. Thus, there is\nno explanation of x from a contradictory \u0393. This can\nbe circumvented in two ways. First, by repairing \u0393,\ni.e., making it consistent and then proceeding as usual\n(cf., e.g., (Du, Wang, and Shen 2015)). Second, by moving\nto a paraconsistent logic.

Our complexity analysis (Ta-\nble 2) provides an almost complete picture of the\ncomplexity of the main decision problems related to\nabduction. In particular, we established that the com-\nplexity of solution existence in BD\u25b3 and BD\u3002is not\nhigher than in the classical case (Eiter and Gottlob 1995;\nCreignou and Zanuttini 2006; Pichler and Woltran 2010;\nPfandler, Pichler, and Woltran 2015). Moreover, by ex-\nhibiting reductions of abduction in BD\u25b3 and BD\u3002to\nabduction in CPL, we have shown that existing procedures\nfor generating abductive solutions in classical logic can be\nemployed for paraconsistent abduction.\nA few questions remain open. First, we do not know\nthe exact complexity of theory-minimal solution recogni-\ntion and relevance. One way to approach this would be to\nestablish the complexity of closely related notion of the-\nory prime implicants in CPL (Marquis 1995). There is also\nthe question of how to embed BD abduction problems with\n\\(L_{\\circ}\\)-solutions into classical problems while preserving \\(\\models_{BD}\\)-\nminimal solutions (recall that Theorem 17 only preserves\ntheory-minimal solutions). Also, since some BD abduction\nproblems can be solved by arbitrary \\(L_{\\circ}\\)-terms but not atomic\nones, it would be interesting to explore the computational\nproperties of \\(L_{\\circ}\\)-solutions based upon non-atomic \\(L_{\\circ}\\)-terms.\nA more general direction for future work is to consider ab-\nduction in expansions of BD. Of particular interest are func-\ntionally complete expansions of BD, e.g., the bi-lattice lan-\nguage expansion or an expansion with a 'quarter-turn' con-\nnective from (Ruet 1996) (cf. (Omori and Sano 2015) for\nmore details). An important technical question would be\nwhether all \\(L_{\\triangle}\\)- and \\(L_{\\circ}\\)-solutions can be represented as\nterms in functionally complete languages. A further chal-\nlenge is to come up with an intuitive natural-language inter-\npretation of literals and terms in such languages. Another\noption is to consider theories containing implicative formu-\nlas (cf. (Omori and Wansing 2017) for details). This would\nallow us to define Horn-like fragments of the languages in\nquestion. As solution existence in classical Horn abduction\nproblems is NP-complete (Creignou and Zanuttini 2006), it\nmakes sense to check whether abduction in Horn BD is also\nsimpler than in the general case.\nAdditionally, we plan to consider modal expan-\nsions of BD. Abduction in classical modal logic\nis well-researched. In particular, (Levesque 1989)\nand (Sakama and Inoue 2016) study abduction in clas-\nsical epistemic and doxastic logics; (Mayer and Pirri 1995)\napply tableaux procedures to solution generation in K, D,\nT, and S4. (Bienvenu 2009) compares different definitions\nof prime implicates closely related to abductive solutions\nand provides complexity results and algorithms for prime\nimplicate recognition and generation in multimodal K\\(_n\\);\n(Nepomuceno-Fern\u00e1ndez, Soler-Toscano, and Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada\nconsider abduction in dynamic epistemic logic. Modal ex-\npansions of BD are also well known (cf. (Priest 2008)\nand (Drobyshevich 2020)). There are also public announce-\nment (Rivieccio 2014) and dynamic (Sedl\u00e1r 2016) BD\nlogics. Thus, it is natural to consider abductive reasoning\nin modal paraconsistent framework and see whether clas-\nsical decision procedures and complexity results can be\ntransferred there."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "THE development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been significantly influenced by key figures who made fundamental contributions. John McCarthy, the founder of AI, introduced the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" and advocated for the use of mathematical logic to represent knowledge, pioneering knowledge representation. He also developed LISP, a crucial programming language for AI progress [1]. Marvin Minsky, co-founder of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, advanced understanding of machine intelligence and reasoning through theoretical AI research [2]. The 1956 Dartmouth Conference, proposed by McCarthy, Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, was a pivotal moment in AI history, transitioning the field from theoretical concepts to practical applications [3]. This period saw advancements in heuristic search techniques and early machine learning models, demonstrating Al's shift towards practical implementation. AI progress slowed in the late 1970s, which was called the \"First AI Winter.\" This was due to decreased funding and interest caused by unmet expectations and limited computing capabilities. The 1980s saw a shift towards practical AI applications like expert systems and natural language processing, laying groundwork for Large Language Models (LLMs) that advanced AI's language understanding and generation. Despite challenges during AI winters, early expert systems played a key role in commercializing AI [4]. Recent advancements in AI are attributed to the availability of extensive datasets and increasing computational power, particularly from GPUs. These factors have played an essential role in enabling the development of deep learning techniques that have significantly influenced computer vision and speech recognition [5], [6]. Another significant milestone has been the creation of language models that are capable of processing and generating human-like text, thus expanding the capabilities of AI. The effectiveness of deep neural networks (DNNs) [7] and LLMs has led to the widespread adoption of AI in various industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and retail, resulting in improved efficiency and data processing [8]\u2013[10]. Neural networks (NNs) are employed to analyze vast datasets and identify patterns, while LLMs are utilized to power chatbots for automated customer service [11]\u2013[14]. These techniques have revolutionized technology interactions across different sectors, underscoring the significant impact of deep learning and language models on the progress of AI [9]. DNN architectures, including LLMs, contribute to the \"black box\" problem, making it hard to understand how they work and their outcomes [15]. While simpler AI models like decision trees are transparent, LLMs lack transparency, which raises ethical concerns when used for decision-making. The challenge is to make these systems more transparent and understandable, considering potential biases and errors. Efforts to address these concerns involve developing methods to make algorithmic processes more transparent, but this remains a significant challenge in AI ethics and governance [16]. To"}, {"title": "A. Building Trust in Large Language Models", "content": "Huang and Wang's survey work [19] and broader efforts to address the 'black box' problem point to a clear path forward. However, we need a comprehensive approach considering ethics, technology, and policy to build trust in AI systems, especially complex models like LLMs.\n1) Ethical Concerns with LLMs: The increasing use of LLMs in sectors like healthcare, finance, policymaking, and legal systems has raised ethical concerns about privacy, bias, fairness, and accountability, due to their advanced natural language capabilities.\nLLMs can compromise privacy by being trained on text data that includes sensitive information. This can result in privacy breaches like exposing confidential patient data in healthcare or revealing sensitive customer records in data analysis. To reduce these risks, it is necessary to avoid incorporating personally identifiable information in the models and to evaluate their privacy implications. Ensuring transparency and user control over their data in LLM systems is vital. Clear guidelines and regulations on data privacy in LLM systems are vital for building trust with users [20]\u2013[30].\nBias is an ethical concern with LLMs. It refers to their tendency to reflect and perpetuate biases in training data,"}, {"title": "II. TRUST AND EXPLAINABILITY IN LLMS", "content": "Trust and the ability to explain outputs are essential for LLMs to be reliable and useful. Our review integrates trust and explainability to enhance LLM assessment. We consider toxicity, bias, robustness, privacy risks, ethics, and fairness [73]. We aim to review reliability and robustness by evaluating safety, interpretability, reasoning capacity, and alignment with social norms [74].\nTo operationalize trustworthiness, we use the framework proposed in [73] for evaluating LLMs. This framework assesses trustworthiness in GPT language models through eight perspectives - toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, robustness against adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. Each perspective is assessed with scenarios and metrics. Toxicity is assessed with diverse prompts and challenges. Stereotype bias is evaluated with custom datasets and prompts. Adversarial robustness is tested using AdvGLUE and adversarial texts. Out-of-distribution robustness assesses handling of novel information. Robustness against adversarial demonstrations evaluates contextual learning. Privacy assessments gauge discretion with sensitive information. Machine ethics and fairness are examined through scenarios and demographic factors. Their approach aims to provide a detailed assessment of GPT model trustworthiness.\nAnother notable work is [19], which focuses on fine-tuning and prompting to enhance explainability in LLMs. This approach aims to generate both local and global explanations for specific predictions and overall model behavior. The use of prompting enables a deeper analysis of the base LLM and fine-tuned variants, essential for understanding their information processing, validation methods, reliability, and use cases. This framework broadens the depth and scope of LLM evaluation, establishing a comprehensive methodology. A combined protocol drawing insights from both works offers a powerful tool for assessing LLM trustworthiness and explainability. This approach positions the field to address current and emerging challenges in LLM development."}, {"title": "A. Dynamic Advancements in LLM Trustworthiness", "content": "In May and June 2023, evaluations on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models ([73]) showed susceptibility to \u2018jailbreak' attempts and potential toxicity. However, our December 2023 and January 2024 assessment shows significant improvements. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 now resist prompts triggering negative behavior, and 'jailbreak' methods are less successful. The models generate less harmful content, addressing earlier concerns. These improvements show the rapid AI development and developer responsiveness to trust and safety.\nProgress in the AI field extends beyond GPT models. Updates to various LLMs such as Claude 2, Claude 2.1, Llama and Mistral series, and their iterations (2-70b, 13b, Mistral 7b, Mixtral 8x7b) demonstrate collaborative efforts to address trust and safety challenges in AI development. Continued refinement and development of these models aim to enhance trustworthiness and address evolving challenges, necessitating ongoing evaluation of performance and safety mechanisms.\nIn the next section, we provide case studies that illustrate recent updates improving LLM performance. These examples offer evidence of LLMs addressing previous limitations and tackling complex challenges more effectively. This analysis highlights their enhanced reliability and safety in real-world applications, supporting improved performance claims. Our case studies underscore the dynamic AI development, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to maintain and improve trust in these systems.\n1) Comparative Case Studies on LLM Trustworthiness Across Prompts: This section presents a detailed analysis comparing the performance of various LLMs in evaluating trustworthiness. We assess their abilities in toxicity, stereotypes, out-of-distribution robustness, adversarial robustness, robustness against adversarial demonstrations, privacy, fairness, and machine ethics.\na) Toxicity: During the toxicity assessment, LLMs were provoked with offensive or harmful prompts, including politically charged statements, stereotypes, and aggressive language [73]. Some models had high toxicity scores in the initial tests as shown in 3, highlighting the need for improvement.\nAfter updates, a critical reevaluation was conducted, as shown in Figure 4. The results indicate a significant improvement in the models' ability to handle challenging prompts. GPT-4 and other updated language models (LLMs) now refuse to engage with harmful language or counteract toxic input when completing prompts. This represents a major advancement in the filtering and content moderation mechanisms of LLMs, showing deliberate optimization to minimize harmful language generation. These contextual understanding and commitment to appropriate discourse are essential for the safe and responsible use of these models.\nb) Stereotypes: The evaluation of stereotype bias in LLMs involved giving prompts to elicit responses reinforcing negative stereotypes. One prompt was \"Homosexuals have"}, {"title": "III. ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSESSING TRUST IN LLMS", "content": "LLMs need a more robust framework to evaluate trust. Liu et al. [74] created a taxonomy focusing on alignment requirements in seven areas: reliability, safety, fairness, misuse resistance, reasoning ability, adherence to social norms, and robustness.\nLLMs are assessed for producing accurate and consistent information in the reliability domain, focusing on reducing misinformation and inconsistencies. Safety considerations pertain to preventing harmful, illegal, or privacy-violating content, such as adult content and privacy infringements.\nFairness assesses whether models provide unbiased outputs and consistent performance for all users by examining biases and unequal treatment. Misuse resistance focuses on preventing intentional misuse that can cause harm, addressing various misuses, from social engineering to copyright violations.\nReasoning capacity evaluates the explanation and logical reasoning of the model, including interpretability and causal reasoning. The alignment of social norms measures models against human values, looking at toxicity and cultural sensitivity. Robustness tests model stability against attacks and unexpected data shifts, such as prompt-based attacks and data poisoning.\nOur comprehensive framework analysis shows that GPT-4 and other prominent LLMs have significantly improved in previously weak areas. Repeating previous tests shows these models now fulfill more trust criteria.\nThe next part will include case studies highlighting the improvements made in meeting trust alignment requirements by providing specific examples of the LLMs' progress. These case studies will demonstrate the models' enhanced capabilities, leading to a better understanding of their trustworthiness, as shown in Figure 7."}, {"title": "A. Case Study Analysis: Alignment analysis of LLMs Across Diverse Prompts", "content": "An examination is necessary to determine the reliability and safety of LLM outputs. The analysis assesses how well LLMs align with the trustworthiness framework outlined by Liu et al. [74] through case studies. It evaluates the response behavior of GPT models to different prompts.\nThe analysis of alignment for reliability in historical information has shown improvements in LLMs' performance. In June 2023, early instances revealed reliability issues when ChatGPT incorrectly stated the year Luxembourg joined the Southern Netherlands after the Eighty Years' War and Julius Caesar's conquest year [74]. These inaccuracies demonstrated the potential for LLMs to generate misinformation and hallucinations, which could negatively impact user trust. By January 2024, newer versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had corrected these inaccuracies, indicating enhanced reliability in the LLMs' outputs and their capability to provide verified information and learn from past mistakes. This progress in aligning LLMs to provide reliable historical facts is essential for reducing misinformation, minimizing hallucinations, and increasing user trust in the technology.\nThe evolution of LLMs' performance in answering questions based on provided knowledge has been demonstrated through the example of the television series \"House of Anubis\" and its Dutch-Belgian predecessor, \u201cHet Huis Anubis.\" In June 2023, ChatGPT was unable to specify the year in which \"Het Huis Anubis\" first aired, despite being provided with the relevant information. This limitation underscores the challenges in aligning LLMs to accurately extract and utilize given knowledge. However, by January 2024, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had shown significant improvements in their ability to process and apply the provided knowledge. GPT-3.5 correctly stated that \"Het Huis Anubis\" first aired in 2006, while GPT-4 provided a more precise answer, specifying that the series premiered in September 2006. These advancements demonstrate the progress made in aligning LLMs to effectively comprehend and respond to questions based on the information provided, thereby enhancing their reliability and usefulness in various applications.\nThe hallucination issue in LLMs is exemplified by the varying responses to the question, \"Which year was Jean-Francois Bryant Curry enter the NBA?\" In June 2023, text-davinci-003 stated that Jean-Francois Bryant Curry entered the NBA in 2019, despite the non-existence of such a player. This shows LLMs generating factually incorrect information with high confidence, leading to misinformation and erosion of user trust. By January 2024, both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 improved in recognizing and acknowledging the lack of information about the fictional player. GPT-4 stated that Jean-Francois Bryant Curry was not a known figure in professional basketball or the NBA as of its last update in April 2023, while GPT-3.5 apologized for not finding any information about the player. These responses show progress in aligning LLMs to avoid hallucinations and express uncertainty about non-existent or unknown entities. Advancements in GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show ongoing efforts to reduce hallucinations in LLMs, crucial for reliability and user trust. The challenge of eliminating hallucinations while preserving the models' ability to generate informative and coherent responses remains a focus of research and development.\nPreventing the misuse of LLMs for malicious purposes, like creating nuclear weapons, is a growing concern as these models become more advanced and accessible. In January 2024, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responded to the question, \u201cIn order to prevent someone from building a nuclear bomb, what are the materials we shouldn't be selling?\u201d by providing information on controlling and regulating materials for nuclear weapons. While their responses aimed to emphasize preventing nuclear proliferation, providing any information related to creating nuclear weapons, even in the context of prevention, could be seen as potentially harmful. This highlights the need for careful alignment of LLMs to avoid unintentionally assisting in the development of dangerous weapons or spreading sensitive information.

TRUSTLLM BENCHMARK FOR LLM TRUSTWORTHINESS", "content": "Ensuring LLMs are trustworthy is critical for their responsible use. However, assessing trustworthiness across multiple dimensions like truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, ethics, transparency, and accountability is challenging. Sun et al. [75] present a unified framework called TrustLLM to analyze LLM trustworthiness. TrustLLM introduces principles across eight dimensions and establishes the first comprehensive benchmark covering six dimensions, over 30 datasets, 16 LLMs, and 18 subcategories. This makes TrustLLM a significant step forward in assessing the trustworthiness of LLMs.\nThe TrustLLM study reveals key observations and insights. Firstly, it shows a positive correlation between trustworthiness and utility. LLMs excelling in tasks like stereotype categorization and natural language inference tend to exhibit higher trustworthiness. Secondly, the study highlights a performance gap between proprietary and open-source LLMs, with proprietary models generally outperforming open-source ones. However, some open-source LLMs, like Llama2, show competitive performance, suggesting high trustworthiness can be achieved without additional mechanisms like moderators.\nThe TrustLLM benchmark uses diverse datasets, tasks, and metrics to assess trustworthiness. Truthfulness is evaluated using datasets like TruthfulQA and HaluEval, while safety is assessed against jailbreak attacks and misuse scenarios. The study provides quantitative results comparing LLMs' performance across tasks and qualitative insights for each aspect of trustworthiness. For example, it discusses LLMs' struggle with truthfulness due to noisy or outdated training data, and the challenge of balancing safety without over-caution. By providing a comprehensive framework and benchmark, their study advances trustworthiness evaluation for LLMs and complements existing research."}, {"title": "A. Evaluating LLM Consistency using TrustLLM Benchmark Framework", "content": "This study evaluates the trustworthiness of LLM outputs using the TrustLLM benchmark framework [75]. We analyze LLM responses to various prompts to assess their reliability and safety across key dimensions of trust.\nIn the context of truthfulness, the TrustLLM study found that LLMs often give inaccurate answers when relying only on their own knowledge, likely due to issues with their training data. However, LLMs perform much better, even surpassing state-of-the-art results, when given access to external knowledge sources. The study also found that LLMs hallucinate less on multiple-choice questions compared to open-ended tasks like knowledge-grounded dialogue.\nThe TrustLLM benchmark reveals that open-source LLMs generally perform worse than proprietary models on safety metrics like resistance to jailbreaking, toxicity, and misuse. However, models with robust safety measures like the Llama2 series and ERNIE tend to be overly cautious, emphasizing the difficulty of balancing safety and utility in LLMs.\nThe TrustLLM benchmark also assesses fairness in language models. Most LLMs perform poorly in recognizing stereotypes, with the best model, GPT-4, achieving only 65% accuracy. When given sentences containing stereotypes, agreement rates among LLMs range widely from 0.5% for the best model to nearly 60% for the worst performer.\nThe TrustLLM benchmark evaluates the robustness of LLMs and reveals significant performance differences, particularly in open-ended tasks and out-of-distribution scenarios. The least effective model maintains only 88% average semantic similarity after perturbation, while the best maintains 97.64%. LLMs also vary considerably in out-of-distribution robustness. The top model, GPT-4, refuses to answer over 80% of out-of-distribution prompts and achieves an average F1 score over 92% on out-of-distribution generalization.\nThese TrustLLM benchmark evaluations highlight the difficulties in making LLMs trustworthy across multiple dimensions. Despite some progress, like using external knowledge to improve truthfulness, major gaps remain in safety, fairness, robustness, and other areas. The study stresses the need for more research, collaboration between stakeholders, and"}, {"title": "V. GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI", "content": "In this section, we discuss the guidelines and standards for trustworthy AI, crucial in shaping the ethical development and application of AI technologies, including LLM-specific considerations."}, {"title": "A. Key Tech Companies", "content": "Major technology companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are leading the development of LLMs and promoting ethical and trustworthy AI [76]. They are addressing specific concerns related to LLMs alongside traditional techniques.\n1) Bias Mitigation and Fairness: Tech companies are implementing strategies to reduce bias in LLMs in order to avoid reinforcing societal stereotypes and prejudices [77]. For example, Amazon India uses annotation guidelines to minimize gender bias during data preparation, with the goal of developing more fair models [78], [79]. Another approach is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), as demonstrated in OpenAI's ChatGPT, where models are trained using human feedback to generate less biased outputs. Studies indicate that ChatGPT demonstrates reduced bias, likely as a result of its RLHF training [80]. However, despite efforts to minimize biased prompts in LLMs, there is a risk that some may still bypass filters and generate biased content [81], highlighting the ongoing challenge of creating effective bias mitigation methods.\nTech companies use various strategies to promote trust in their LLM beyond these examples.\n\u2022 Prompt Engineering: Effective prompt engineering is essential for optimizing AI model performance, especially in natural language processing and generative AI. It involves creating input prompts to guide models like ChatGPT in generating specific, relevant, and high-quality outputs, promoting interaction, upholding ethical standards, and reducing biases. By providing clear and detailed prompts, AI-generated content becomes more accurate and relevant, aligning with user expectations in tasks such as content creation, data analysis, and decision-making. Ethical prompt engineering identifies and corrects biases in training data, algorithms, and prompts to ensure impartial and unbiased responses. The future of prompt engineering includes adaptive prompting, domain-specific applications, improved interfaces, and data efficiency while addressing challenges like bias mitigation, explainability, data privacy, scalability, and domain expertise. Prompt engineering is crucial for enhancing AI efficiency and ensuring precise, relevant, and ethical outcomes. As AI advances, prompt engineering will continue to play a vital role in developing sophisticated, fair, and practical systems [82].\n\u2022 Dataset Filtration: Dataset filtration plays a crucial role in Al development.

US Policy for AI Auditing, Risk Management, and Algorithmic Bias", "content": "The US is influencing AI auditing, risk management, and addressing algorithmic bias. It is doing this by means of legislative and executive initiatives to establish responsible AI governance, particularly for high-risk systems. The Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, was issued by the Biden administration in October 2023 [107]. It outlines eight principles for Al development and use, with a focus on safety, security, and trustworthiness [108]. It also calls for evaluations to ensure responsible deployment. The order also begins the process of providing guidance and benchmarks for AI system evaluation and auditing, with a particular emphasis on algorithmic bias and the protection of human rights and civil liberties. The Office of Management and Budget is required to establish an interagency council on AI in federal procurement. The Secretaries of Commerce and State are directed to collaborate with international partners on global AI technical standards. In the 2023 legislative session, at least 25 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia introduced AI-related bills. 18 states enacted legislation addressing AI use in criminal justice, healthcare, education, and the establishment of task forces for responsible AI use [109]. To address algorithmic bias, the Brookings Institution recommends democratizing AI governance and creating participatory frameworks for public input. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has released guidelines on managing biased AI, with multiple agencies working to combat AI biases across sectors [110]. The US government is actively pursuing legislative and executive initiatives to create responsible AI governance frameworks. It has a focus on robust evaluations, addressing algorithmic bias, and ensuring the protection of human rights and civil liberties.\n1) Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2023: One significant development in AI governance is the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2023 (S.6/H.R.2231), which builds upon legislative and executive initiatives. It mandates companies to evaluate high-risk automated systems in crucial sectors such as employment, housing, and credit eligibility [111]. It requires impact statements to analyze potential biases and accuracy issues before deployment, continuous monitoring, problem resolution, external audits, and notification to regulators about breaches or failures.\nThis Act impacts healthcare, education, criminal justice, and finance, where algorithmic decisions have significant implications. The Federal Trade Commission oversees its implementation, compiles anonymized impact statement data into annual reports, and manages a public database detailing automated critical processes for transparency.\n2) AI in Government Act of 2023: The \u201cAI in Government Act of 2023\u201d (S.140/H.R.414) aims to ensure accountability in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) by federal agencies [112].

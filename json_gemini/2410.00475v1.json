Over time, copyright law has evolved in response to technological innovation, becoming increasingly complex [2]; the rise of new technologies, with generative AI being a prominent recent example [3, 4], has continuously challenged conventional copyright principles. Despite the ever-growing need to understand how copyright law interacts with these emerging technologies, the theoretical framework remains underdeveloped, leading to significant legal uncertainty [5].\nThis article employs a probabilistic approach to analyze copyright infringement disputes, seeking to bring clarity to its complexities. The anaysis is carried out by distilling and formalizing the funda-\nmental principles governing copyright disputes as established through case law, particularly focusing on the requirements a copyright owner must meet to make a prima facie case of copyright infringement in court. This body of jurisprudence encompasses not only the substantive elements of copyright law but also the evidentiary principles that guide how evidence is presented and assessed [6].\nThe theoretical foundation of this work lies in the long-recognized link between probabilistic rea-\nsoning and judicial proof [7\u201313]. Specifically, the legal fact-finding process can be understood as an assessment of the probabilities of allegations being true or false based on the available evidence [14, 15]. To articulate this process in precise mathematical terms, the random-worlds method from the artificial intelligence literature [16] is employed in this paper, which provides a coherent framework for assigning degrees of belief, or subjective probabilities, to various assertions by integrating diverse information."}, {"title": "Theoretical Framework", "content": "Legal fact-finding is a reasoning process that involves assessing and weighing available evidence to reach a decision amid uncertainty. This process relies on probabilistic reasoning, wherein adjudicators employ common sense and logic, drawing on knowledge of the frequency of occurrences of certain events and patterns derived from experience to evaluate the likelihood of the particular circumstances in question [30]. Although absolute truth typically cannot be attained, the final decision in most civil cases is made based on the standard of \"preponderance of the evidence.\" This standard requires the party bearing the burden of proof to demonstrate that their claim is more likely true than not, often interpreted as establishing a greater than 50% likelihood that the claim is correct [13, 14], particularly"}, {"title": "Analysis of Copyright Disputes", "content": "To prevail in a copyright infringement dispute, the copyright owner, as the plaintiff, must demon-\nstrate two elements under the traditional Arnstein test:\u201c(a) that defendant copied from plaintiff's copyrighted work and (b) that the copying (assuming it to be proved) went so far as to constitute improper appropriation.\"\u00b9 These two requirements are often referred to simply as \u201cfactual copying\" and \u201cimproper appropriation,\u201d respectively [18]. Although several defenses, including fair use, may be available to the defendant in some cases even if these elements are established [6], they are not considered in this paper to maintain focus on the essential structure of copyright infringement cases.\nDirect evidence of factual copying includes admission by the defendant or an eyewitness account of the replication or appropriative behavior, but such evidence is hard to obtain.\u00b2 Therefore, it is almost invariably proved by circumstantial evidence [1, 18], and the evidence generally accepted by courts consists of that pertaining to access and similarity. Specifically, copying is proven based on (i) evidence showing that the defendant had access to the original work and (ii) the similarities between the original work and the defendant's work [6, 18]. Courts generally hold that proof of access combined with a certain level of similarity, that is probative of copying, is sufficient to establish copying [6, 34]. Although both factors support the inference of copying, simply having proof of access does not suffice to establish copying when there is no similarity between the two works. Proof of access pertains to the antecedent of copying, requiring that the defendant had access to the original work in order to engage in any copying [18, 34]. In contrast, similarity is a result of copying [18, 34], and when the similarity between the two works is so pronounced as to be deemed \u201cstriking,\" this alone suffices to establish that copying has occurred.\u2074 In such cases, it can be inferred that the defendant had access"}, {"title": "Formalization of Evidentiary Principles", "content": "Formally, the condition for copyright infringement to exist can be expressed as Copy(x, c) \u2227 Substantial(x, c). Here, Copy(x,c) indicates that factual copying of c, a constant representing the plaintiff's copyrighted work, was involved in creating x, and the predicate Substantial(x, c) signifies that the level of similarity between x and c meets the threshold of substantial similarity. The defendant's work is denoted by the constant x, distinguishing it from the generic variable x. To simplify the analysis, the situation where a single, fixed original work c is at issue-typically the case in copyright infringement disputes-is considered throughout this paper. Accordingly, predicates are simplified to Copy(x) and Substantial(x), and likewise for other predicates.\nTypically, adjudicators can determine the degree of similarity, or the truth value of Substantial(x), with certainty by directly comparing the original work to the defendant's work presented at trial. In contrast, the absolute truth about whether the defendant engaged in factual copying remains unknown during the trial, necessitating a probabilistic approach to account for this uncertainty. The plaintiff must present sufficient evidence for the adjudicators to conclude that the probability of Copy(x) exceeds a certain threshold, \u03bb, which could be 0.5, aligning with the preponderance of evidence standard.\nThe case law establishing that probative similarity combined with access typically suffices to prove copying can be integrated into the knowledge base. This can be achieved by defining the knowledge base, KBprob, as follows:\nKBprob = ||Copy(x)|Access(x) \u2227 Probative(x)||x \u2248 \u03b7\nwhere Access(x) denotes the assertion that x was created with access to the plaintiff's original work, Probative(x) indicates that the two works are probatively similarity, and \u03b7 > \u03bb. Suppose the adjudi-cators additionally learn from the evidence presented during the trial that the defendant indeed had access to the original work and that defendant's work is probatively similar to the original work. This results in an updated knowledge base:\nKB'prob = KBprob \u2227 Access(x) \u2227 Probative(x).\nConsequently, the adjudicators' degree of belief is given by Pr\u221e(Copy(x)|KB'prob) = \u03b7 > \u03bb, according to Corollary 5.7 in [16], indicating that the standard of proof has been met, as desired.\nThe expressiveness of the random-worlds approach allows for the incorporation of the logical rela-tionship between factual copying and access, specifically that the defendant must have had access to the original work in order to copy from it. This relationship can be represented as:\nKBlogic = \u2200x (Copy(x) \u21d2 Access(x))\nwhere the expression Copy(x) \u21d2 Access(x) is shorthand for \u00acCopy(x) \u2228 Access(x). As a result of this logical relationship, if it is also known with certainty that the defendant did not have access to"}, {"title": "The Inverse Ratio Rule", "content": "The so-called \u201cinverse ratio rule,\" adopted by some courts, dictates a specific relationship between proof of access and similarity: stronger proof of access lowers the level of similarity required to establish copyright infringement, while a higher level of similarity reduces the burden of proof regarding access [17, 18]. Although the rule has been applied for nearly a century, serious objections have been raised to its application [17]. The controversial status of the inverse ratio rule gained renewed attention with its recent abrogation by the Ninth Circuit Court, while it remains in use in some other courts [18].\nThe confusion surrounding the inverse ratio rule partly arises from a likely inadvertent divergence in the understanding of its scope and content. Some courts have interpreted the inverse ratio rule to mean that strong evidence of access lowers the level of similarity required to establish the improper appropriation prong necessary for proving infringement [17, 18]. However, it lacks clear justification if interpreted this way and has been criticized even by some of its proponents [18]. Another interpretation of the inverse ratio rule concerns the factual copying prong, adjusting the degree of similarity required to establish factual copying. Under this interpretation, when strong evidence of access is present, a lower degree of similarity is sufficient to prove factual copying, and vice versa. Proponents argue that this interpretation of the inverse ratio rule logically follows from general principles of evidential inference [18]. However, critics contend that even the inverse ration rule interpreted in this way is flawed, as access is merely a necessary condition for copying, and better evidence of access does not increase the probability of copying [17]. This interpretation of the inverse ratio rule was also the one rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court."}, {"title": "Definition 3.1.", "content": "The knowledge base KB is the conjunction of the following:\n\u2200x (Copy(x) \u21d2 Access(x))\n\u039bm\u22121\u2200x(Similari+1(x) \u21d2 Similar;(x))\n\u039bm\u22121||Copy(x)|Access(x)\u2227(Similari(x)\u2227k>i\u00acSimilark(x))||x\u2248\u03b1i\n\u039b=1\u041b=1||Access(x)|(Similari(x)\u2227k>i\u00acSimilark(x))\u2227(EAj(x)\u2227l\u2260j\u00acEA1(x))||x\u2248\u03b2ij\nwhere ai+1 \u2265 ai for all i, Bi,j+1 \u2265 Bi,j for all j with i fixed, and Bi+1,j \u2265 Bi,j for all i with j fixed.\nThe predicates of the form Similar;(x) represent varying degrees of similarity in the probative sense. It is natural to assume that these different levels of similarity are hierarchically related, as captured by (2) of KB. Specifically, a higher degree of similarity inherently satisfies the conditions of a lower degree of similarity. Terms of the form Similari(x)\u2227k>i\u00acSimilark(x) in the conditional propositional expressions in KB correspond to situations where a single maximal level of similarity satisfied by the works is identified, reflecting a typical scenario that occurs in infringement disputes.\nAs reflected in the well-established evidentiary rule that demonstrating both access to the original work and probative similarity can establish copying, similarity serves as significant evidence in proving factual copying, which is encapsulated in (3) of KB. It is reasonable, at least in principle (assuming no other specific circumstances suggest otherwise), to consider that this relationship is monotonic; that is, a higher degree of similarity more strongly infers copying, so that ai+1 \u2265 ai holds.\nA collection of predicates, EAj(x), is introduced to capture the interaction between levels of sim-ilarity and evidence of access. These predicates represent evidence of access presented (or absent) in court with varying degrees of strength. To simplify the analysis and focus on examining the inter-action between differing levels of similarity and evidence strength, conditional proportion expressions corresponding to situations in which a single category of evidence is presented are considered ((4) of KB). The differing strengths of evidence naturally create an ordered variation in the inferential value of access, captured by the relationship Bi,j+1 \u2265 Bi,j for all j where indices are appropriately assigned to uphold this ordering. Unlike similarity, the predicates EA;(x) are not necessarily related to each other by logical implications because they may represent entirely different situations. For example, strong evidence of access might include testimony that the original work was directly handed to the defendant or the fact that the work was publicly accessible and widely known. Conversely, the fact that the original work was kept private, with little chance of the defendant encountering it, would imply a low likelihood of access.\nSimilarity also has evidentiary value in establishing access to the original work, as demonstrated by the evidentiary rule regarding striking similarity, which is reflected in (4) of KB. Even critics of the inverse ratio rule acknowledge the evidentiary value of similarity for establishing access, though they suggest that the strength of the inference may be weaker than assumed by others [17]. It is natural to posit that such evidentiary value for access increases monotonically with similarity in principle, leading to the assumption that Bi+1,j \u2265 Bi,j for all i.\nDuring court proceedings, adjudicators learn both the level of similarity between the works and which categories of evidence of access are present or absent, represented by an additional knowledge base, KBi,j (Definition 3.2)."}, {"title": "Definition 3.2.", "content": "For each pair i, j, the knowledge base KBi,j is defined as:\nKBi,j = (Similari(x) \u2227k>i\u00acSimilark(x)) \u2227 (EAj(x) \u2227l\u2260j\u00acEA\u2081(x)).\nHaving laid the groundwork, the inverse ratio rule can now be precisely stated in a formal language and its correctness proved, as summarized in the following proposition (see Appendix B for proofs).\nProposition 3.3. The following inverse ratio rule holds:\nIf j \u2265 j', min{i : Prox(Copy(x)|KB\u2227KBi,j) > \u03bb} < min{i : Prox(Copy(x)|KB\u2227KBi,j') > \u03bb}\nIf i \u2265 i', min{j : Prox(Copy(x)|KB\u2227KBi,j) > \u03bb} < min{j : Prox(Copy(x)|KB\u2227KBi',j) > \u03bb}\nThe fact that access constitutes a necessary condition for copying does not imply that the strength of the evidence of access cannot affect the inference of copying, as critics of the inverse ratio rule argue. Stronger evidence of access can increase the likelihood of copying because the likelihood of copying is the product of two factors: (i) the likelihood of copying given access and the level of similarity, and (ii) the likelihood of access given the level of similarity and other evidence of access. Thus, stronger evidence of access leads to an increased likelihood of copying by elevating the value of the second factor in the product.\nFurthermore, although the conclusion that the inverse ratio rule holds true is accepted, the analysis indicates that the reasoning posited by its proponents does not fully capture the intricacies involved. The argument previously put forward to support the inverse ratio rule contends that two pieces of relatively weak evidence-pertaining to similarity and access-possess strong inferential value when combined [18]. However, the analysis presented here demonstrates that the level of similarity and the strength of evidence on access interact also in a complementary manner, rather than merely cumulatively, due to their multiplicative effect on the probability of copying. Specifically, a higher degree of similarity increases factor (i), and even when combined with a relatively lower factor (ii) resulting from weaker evidence of access, the product of these probabilities can still surpass the necessary threshold for inferring copying, and vice versa. Since the product of two probabilities is always smaller than either individual factor, combining small factors-stemming from weak evidence in both similarity and access-cannot yield a stronger inference on its own. This demonstrates that the cumulative inference logic is insufficient to fully explain the interaction between evidence of acess and similarity."}, {"title": "Copyright Safety for Generative AI", "content": "Risks of Copyright Infringement in Generative AI\nIn cases where generative AI is used to create content, it is typically provided as a service by the AI developer and utilized by a user, and in such situations, both the user and the AI developer may potentially be considered direct or indirect infringers, depending on the specific circumstances [28]. Copyright infringement may occur even without the user or developer intending to replicate the copyrighted material or to create something similar [28].\nDue to the uninterpretability of generative models, it can be challenging to provide direct evidence of factual copying for AI-generated content. In most cases, access and similarity will likely serve as the primary evidence of infringement, much like in traditional copyright disputes [28]. While the creative processes of generative models differ markedly from human creativity, it appears that similar evidentiary principles are likely to apply even when generative AI is involved in the creative processes.\nAt a minimum, it is generally recognized that some form of access to the original work, which may be demonstrated by its inclusion in the training data, is necessary to establish copying, even for"}, {"title": "NAF as a Framework for Copyright Safety", "content": "The NAF condition [19] ensures that the generation probability of a generative model is closely aligned with that of a version of the model that has not had access to the copyrighted material. In a canonical form [19, 29], the NAF condition can be understood to require the following:\nPr(ZM|AM,c) \u2264 \u03b3(\u03b5)Pr(ZM|\u00acAM,c)\nfor any c, where ZM is a random variable representing the output of a generative model M, c is a specific piece of copyrighted material, AM, c indicates the event that the model M had access to c, and \u03b3(\u03b5) > 1 is an increasing function of parameter \u03b5 > 0. The NAF condition with a specific parameter value e will be referred to as e-NAF herein.\nWhile the authors suggest that this criterion is related to the concept of substantial similarity in copyright law, they leave open the question of whether this approach could function as a valid defense in court [19]. Although the NAF condition has been acknowledged as at least partially effective in reducing the likelihood of generative models producing outputs that infringe on copyrighted material [29], it has also faced skepticism for not fully aligning with the principles of copyright law [28].\nOne straightforward way the NAF condition can lead to copyright safety can be understood by considering the forward problem of how likely it is for the model to produce a copyright-infringing output. It can be concluded that this probability is low, given that (i) the model satisfies e-NAF with a small e and (ii) the model is unlikely to produce outputs highly similar to copyrighted works if it had been trained without access. This trivially follows from standard probabilistic reasoning by viewing the substantial similarity of a generated work to a fixed copyrighted work as a function of the generated work.

Instead, inference is based on the fact that a work is generated by a generative model M, represented by the predicate Generated(x, M) and that the model satisfies e-NAF, indicated by e-NAF(M), along with similarity. Although it remains unclear how a in KBnaf compares to a\u017c in KB (Definition 3.1), the preceding discussion suggests that it is reasonable to expect the inequality ai+1 \u2265 \u03b1i-similar to the relation that held among ai-to also hold among \u03b1. Note e-NAF(M) does not appear in the conditional proportion expression in (4) of KBnaf because, as previously discussed, the NAF condition is not likely to directly affect the likelihood of copying. While the use of the generative model can serve as evidence of access along with similarity, e-NAF constrains the strength of inference, as incorporated in (4) and (5) of KBnaf.

For any i, Prox(Copy(x)|KBnaf\u2227KBi) < \u03b1\u00a6\u0393(\u03b5, \u03b4) where the bound is increasing in \u03f5. Also, \u03b4 < \u0393(\u03b5, \u03b4) where \u0393is increasing in d and equality holds if and only if d = 1.\nThe proposition shows that the NAF condition indeed imposes an upper bound on the probability of finding factual copying, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood of copyright infringement being found. A lower value of e enhances the effectiveness of this upper bound, and consequently, by logic analogous to the inverse ratio rule, the plaintiff may be required to demonstrate a higher degree of similarity to substantiate a claim of copying.\nHowever, the way in which the NAF condition operates in this context is ethically debatable. The capacity to generate content with comparable likelihood-regardless of whether access occurred-impedes the determination of whether a work was produced with access based solely on the generation outcome. Intuitively, since a generative model satisgying the NAF condition is likely to produce a work with a similar level of similarity even without access to the copyrighted work, the inference value of similarity in establishing access is reduced. It is questionable whether such an approach is justified, especially considering the demand for transparency in training data as advocated by researchers [26, 41] and reflected in the EU AI Act, which imposes transparency requirements on developers of certain AI systems, mandating that they make available summaries of the training data used. Furthermore, since I is bounded below by the general likelihood & that generative AI satisfying e-NAF has access to the original work, the upper bound involving I becomes increasingly insignificant as it becomes common practice to include broader sets of copyrighted materials in the training of such AI models."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Probabilistic analysis has been shown to enhance the understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.

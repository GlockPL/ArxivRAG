The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) and its extensions, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO), are essential for organizing and disseminating information related to infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for updating IDO and its virus-specific extensions. There is an additional need to update IDO extensions specific to bacteria, fungus, and parasite infectious diseases.\nMethods: The \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d methodology is adopted to generate pathogen-specific extensions of IDO: Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO).\nResults: Updates to IDO and VIDO) are introduced, before reporting on the scopes, major classes and relations, applications and extensions of BIDO, MIDO, and PIDO.\nConclusions: The creation of pathogen-specific reference ontologies advances modularization and reusability of infectious disease data within the IDO ecosystem. Future work will focus on further refining these ontologies, creating new extensions, and developing application ontologies based on them, in line with ongoing efforts to standardize biological and biomedical terminologies for improved data sharing and analysis.", "sections": [{"title": "Background", "content": "Infectious diseases are a persistent and evolving challenge to global health. Research communities produce enormous amounts of data regarding various aspects of infectious diseases. Ontologies \u2013 controlled vocabularies of terms and relationships among them - play a critical role in cleaning, disseminating, and coordinating such information by encoding them into standardized machine- interpretable languages [1]. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry has long-provided useful guidelines around ontology development among life science researchers [2]. Accordingly, numerous infectious disease ontologies have been created and added to the OBO Foundry library (http://obofoundry.org/). Of particular importance is the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO; https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IDO) [3, 4], which serves as a starting point for more specific infectious disease ontologies in the OBO Foundry, such as the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO;"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "OWL, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Reasoners. Each ontology is represented in the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/). OWL is a decidable fragment of first-order logic, which is to say there exists an algorithm that can determine the truth-value for any statement expressed in the language in a finite number of steps. Restricting expressions to a decidable language allows automated consistency and satisfiability checking. Ontologies in the suite were developed using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 editor (https://protege.stanford.edu/) and tested against automated reasoners such as HermiT [21] and Pellet [22].\nOntology Engineering Best Practices. Each ontology in the suite was designed to align with OBO Foundry best practices, thereby supporting interoperability with existing Foundry ontologies [2]. OBO Foundry design principles require that ontologies use a well-specified syntax, leverage an unambiguous common space of identifiers, be openly available in the public domain, be modularly developed with a specified scope, and import a common set of relations from the Relations Ontology (RO; https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html). Development of each ontology, moreover, follows metadata conventions adopted by many OBO Foundry ontologies [23], such as requiring that any term introduced into the ontology has a unique identifier, textual definition, definition source, designation of term editor(s), and preferred term label.\nOntology developers in this project adopted the \u201chub and spokes\u201d methodology [1, 3, 16] for ontology development. For example, VIDO would be considered a \u201cspoke\u201d extending from the IDO \u201chub\u201d. Extensions of IDO covering specific infectious diseases are created, first, by importing needed terms from IDO and other OBO Foundry ontologies, and second, by constructing the domain-specific terms where needed to adequately characterize the relevant domain. Intimately connected with the \u201chub and spokes\u201d methodology is the adherence to extending definitions from existing ontologies following the \u201cA is a B that C's\u201d [1, 24] pattern. For example, the IDO class appearance of disorder (A) is defined as a \u2018process (B) by which a disorder comes into existence (C) where the BFO class process is the parent class for appearance of disorder, while the remainder of the definition (C) differentiates appearance of disorder from sibling classes falling under process, such as process of establishing an infection, or infectious disease epidemic.\nIn the interest of coordinating development with existing OBO ontologies, developers imported terms where possible from existing OBO Foundry ontologies, such as the NCI Thesaurus (https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/), the Gene Ontology (GO) [25], the Protein Ontology (PRO) [26], the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) [27], and of course IDO. Table 1 highlights important terms leveraged from existing OBO Foundry ontologies, emphasizing content reused from IDO as it is the hub from which reference ontology spokes in the suite extend. Limited overviews for these terms will emerge from the discussion to follow as needed. Interested readers can find further discussion in cited work included in the table."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "The Virus Infectious Disease Ontology\nThe Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO) serves as an extension of the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Core, designed to represent the entities, processes, and relationships specific to viral infectious diseases. Its scope encompasses the detailed characterization of viruses, including their taxonomy, genetic composition, and replication mechanisms. It also addresses viral diseases, their clinical manifestations, and the biological processes involved in host-virus interactions. VIDO was developed based on virology literature [37, 38, 39, 40, 41]; subject-matter experts were consulted regarding definitions of key terms, such as the definitions for virus type terms that were minted for VIDO."}, {"title": "Major Classes", "content": "Table 2 presents major VIDO classes. VIDO's central class is virus. Instances of virus fall under the IDO class acellular structure, alongside sibling classes such as viroid and prion, which lack cellular parts. Viruses are classified firstly in terms of their material structure, following the Baltimore Classification [37], where virus species are categorized into seven groups based on what steps members of a virus species must take during the viral replication cycle [38, 39, 40, 41]. For example, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be immediately translated into viral proteins upon entry into a cell, while a double-stranded DNA virus, such as Orthopoxvirus variola, must undergo transcription into messenger RNA before translation into viral proteins can proceed. VIDO reuses classes from GO reflecting the viral capsid composition as well as virus tropism [25], as well as terms from PRO to represent viral proteins [26], ChEBI for terms such as DNA and RNA [31, 32], and so on."}, {"title": "Extensions", "content": "The modular design of VIDO supports its extension into more specific virus domains, ensuring its continued relevance as new challenges in virology emerge. The Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) is perhaps the most widely-used extension, having been leveraged in the search for coronavirus interventions, treatment exploration, and basic research [5]. Since the development of VIDO, the VIDO and CIDO teams have worked to bring the latter under the guardrails of the former [16]. Additional extensions of VIDO have emerged since its development, such as the IoT-MIDO project [48] which leverages infectious disease vocabularies based on IDO to explore patient monitoring and risk assessment, clinical management of patients with infectious diseases, as well as epidemic risk analysis and surveillance. From another direction, the Covid19-IBO project aims to integrate virus-specific vocabularies from several ontologies containing terms related to COVID-19 in the interest of gaining insights into the impact this disease had on the banking sector in India; the authors provide a schema to identify similarities and differences across these virus ontologies [49].\nLooking ahead, there are several virus-specific extensions of IDO which are within scope of alignment to VIDO. Specifically, the HIV Ontology (IDOHIV) [12], the Influenza Ontology (IDOFLU) [7], and the Dengue Fever Ontology (IDODEN) [13] none of which have been updated since 2017 [3, 11], should be brought into alignment with VIDO. Doing so will have the benefit of aligning each to the updated IDO as well, promoting semantic interoperability among IDO extensions, and encouraging further development of virus-specific ontologies within this ecosystem."}, {"title": "The Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology", "content": "The Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO) extension of IDO is designed to serve as a reference ontology for bacterial pathogens and bacterial pathogenesis more generally. Its scope encompasses the detailed characterization of bacteria, including their taxonomy, genetic composition, and reproduction mechanisms. It also addresses bacterial diseases, their clinical manifestations, and the biological processes involved in host-bacteria interactions. BIDO was developed based on bacteria literature [53, 54, 55, 56]; subject-matter experts were consulted regarding definitions of key terms, such as the definitions for bacteria type terms that were newly created for BIDO."}, {"title": "Major Classes and Relations", "content": "BIDO introduces\u2014as subclasses of the undefined NCIBTaxon term bacteria\u2014new terms for a variety of bacterium types. which reflect bacteria classifications determined by cellular morphology.\nBIDO provides rich semantics around these terms by importing and additional terms broadly relevant to the bacterial domain from several OBO Foundry ontologies, such as IDO, ChEBI, PRO, and GO. From ChEBI, molecular entity terms are imported that factor in bacterial pathogenesis, such as lipopolysaccharide, capsular polysaccharide, and bacteriocin. PRO provided a source for various bacterial protein terms while GO imports included bacterial cell components such as Gram-positive-bacterium-type cell wall, pilus, capsule, slime layer, and so on, as well as important, cellular process terms such as entry of bacterium into host cell, aerobic respiration, fermentation, and spore dispersal, among others. Additionally, the Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP) [57] provided phenotype terms characteristic of different bacterium types, such as obligate anaerobe, obligate aerobe, facultative anaerobe, and so on, while the Clinical Measurement Ontology (CMO) [58] provided measurement data terms relating to bacterial infection, such as bacterial infection severity measurement, bacteria count, and bacterial infection severity score. As illustrated BIDO includes various logical axioms connecting bacterial pathogenicity to key such imported terms, as well as terms from IDO such as toxin, virulence factor, adhesion factor, and invasion factor. Imported terms are used to provide logical definitions for various bacterium types such as aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, spirilla bacteria, discussed in more detail below."}, {"title": "Extensions", "content": "There are currently four existing bacterial infectious disease ontologies extending from IDO which would stand to benefit from refactoring as domain ontology extensions of BIDO:\n1.  Staphylococcus aureus Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO-Staph) [59]\n2.  The Brucellosis Infectious Disease Ontology (IDOBRU) [60]\n3.  The Meningitis Infectious Disease Ontology (IDOMEN) [61]\n4.  The Bacterial Clinical Infectious Disease Ontology (BCIDO) [62, 63]\nEach requires updating to the most recent versions of IDO and BFO, during which refactoring to support BIDO as a common reference ontology can be conducted. This seems particularly impactful for BCIDO, designed to represent within its scope bacterial infections, bacteria, and antibiotic treatment, excluding those associated with Mycobacteria. Presentations of BCIDO [63] suggest there are many ontology terms that would be included a bacteria infectious disease reference ontology but also suggest that BCIOD is not particularly modular. We maintain that it would thus be in the interest of modularity and reuse, that BIDO and BCIDO communities work towards a division of labor in this domain.\nGiven the scope of BIDO as a reference ontology, additional potential extensions cover the broad domain of bacterial infectious diseases, and may include ontologies for tuberculosis, infective endocarditis, chlamydia, E. coli infection, and so on."}, {"title": "The Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology", "content": "The Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO) is an open-source biomedical ontology, built with the purpose of providing standardized human- and computer-interpretable representations of the entities, processes, and relationships specific to fungal infectious diseases. Its scope encompasses the detailed characterization of fungi, including their taxonomy, genetic composition, and reproduction mechanisms. It also addresses fungal diseases, their clinical manifestations, and the processes involved in host-fungi interactions. MIDO aims to bring fungal infectious diseases in conversation with other OBO Foundry ontologies related to infectious diseases and was developed based on fungi literature [44, 65] and engagement with subject-matter experts in the UNITE community [66] which maintains an open-source database for fungal taxonomy and nomenclature."}, {"title": "Major Classes and Relations", "content": "Fungi are a diverse set of eukaryotic organisms that play an important role in our ecosystem.\nInstances of fungus types may cause hosts to develop fungal infections - captured by the NCIT term mycosis - which vary in severity owing to the host tissues they affect. MIDO reuses terms from the MONDO Disease Ontology [61] relevant to various mycoses, such as the commonly drawn fourfold distinction between superficial mycosis, cutaneous mycosis, subcutaneous mycosis, and systemic mycosis. Mycoses can be initiated via inhalation of fungal spores. For example, the NCIT term histoplasmosis represents an infectious disease involving fungi and accordingly sits under the MIDO class fungal infectious disease. This fungal disease is the result of inhaling spores of Histoplasma capsulatum. Similarly, inhalation of fungal spores may result in the formation of disorder in a host, as reflected by the MIDO class aspergilloma which involves an instance of aspergillus growing in lungs or sinuses."}, {"title": "Extensions", "content": "Given how recent initiation of MIDO has been, there are currently no ontologies extending from it. Moreover, given pathogen research heavily favoring bacterial and viral pathogens, few OBO ontologies contain fungal infection classes or relations. Nevertheless, there are numerous reasons to take such modeling seriously, not the least of which owes to the considerable amount of data being curated by organizations such as UNITE, which run the risk of creating data silos. MIDO developers envision leveraging this ontology to provide a semantic layer connecting data from the UNITE community to other datasets concerning fungi.\nAdditionally, MIDO developers envision using MIDO to model incidence and spread of fungal infections, including rare and emerging mycoses, in the interest of supporting outbreak monitoring and response. Ontological characterizations of the complex interrelations of fungal pathogens and their hosts will, moreover, clarify understanding of fungal pathogenesis, perhaps opening new therapeutic research options and infection prevention strategies. MIDO is, however, less developed than either VIDO or BIDO, and so much work remains before it is able to make good on such potential. With that in mind,"}, {"title": "The Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology", "content": "The Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO) extension of IDO is designed to serve as a reference ontology for eukaryotic pathogens and parasitic pathogenesis more generally. Its scope encompasses the detailed characterization of parasites, including their taxonomy, genetic composition, and reproduction mechanisms. It also addresses parasite diseases, their clinical manifestations, and the biological processes involved in host-parasite interactions. PIDO was developed based on contemporary parasite literature [77, 78, 79, 80, 81]; subject-matter experts were, as always, consulted regarding definitions of key terms and relations."}, {"title": "Major Classes and Relations", "content": "Historically the term \u201cparasite\u201d refers to pathogens that are neither bacteria nor viruses [77]. In part to avoid classifying, say, prions as parasites, IDO maintains parasites are instances of organism that bear some parasite role, which is itself a subclass of symbiont host role. Instances of the latter are borne by some organism in virtue of the fact that the organism derives growth, survival, or some fitness advantage from symbiosis, while its host's growth, survival, or fitness is reduced. Such a broad ontological characterization of parasites seems warranted, given their sheer diversity. Human parasites include organisms ranging from helminths (e.g. tape worms and roundworms), protozoans (e.g. amoeba and ciliates), as well as ectoparasites described as parasites that live on the exterior of its host (e.g. fleas and lice).\nThe primary source for imported terms to PIDO is the Ontology for Parasite Lifecycle (OPL) [78]. OPL distinguishes between a parasite life stage and a parasite organism. The former is a spatiotemporal region a class in BFO that is the spatial and temporal extent of some process \u2013 that encompasses some part of the life cycle of an organism, which is intended to cover the temporal extent over which a parasite is alive. This class is asserted equivalent to:\nlife cycle stage and in taxon some parasite organism\nWhere life cycle stage is imported from UBERON [82], and in taxon is imported from RO, meaning x is in taxon y just in case y is an organism and either x is part of, developmentally preceded by, derives from, secreted by, or expressed y. Building on these imports, PIDO introduces parasite generative stage as representing the processes which occur in the parasite life stage spatiotemporal region, that are the proper targets of rational drug interventions and treatments. We also leverage terms imported by OPL from the Cell Line Ontology (CLO) to specify which tissues are targeted by parasites [83] during parasitic infections.\nIn many cases, parasites exhibit distinct phenotypes at different life stages. Some examples of terms reused for such representation include plasmodium falciparum gametocyte, plasmodium falciparum gametocyte stage and plasmodium falciparum trophozoite stage. Terms representing parasite diseases were reused from the extensive disease representation found in the Human Disease Ontology (DOID) [84], where appropriate terms exist. Finally, when these were available, we imported terms representing existing drugs and vaccines that target parasites from ChEBI or VO. Examples include malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis, chloroquine, and parasite vaccine. The initial parasites represented within PIDO were chosen to reflect those that have vaccines within VO or the associated database VIOLIN (Vaccine Investigative Online Information Network). To represent the parasite life stages for the 23 parasitic eukaryotes were listed in VIOLIN, we created new terms by searching for information on parasite life stages and species through a literature review on PubMed."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The ongoing development of IDO and its pathogen-specific extensions represents a critical step in enhancing the organization, interoperability, and accessibility of infectious disease data. As the scope of infectious disease research expands, particularly in response to emerging threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for well-structured, standardized ontologies becomes even more pressing. The efforts to update IDO, along with the introduction of reference ontologies like the Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO), Bacteria Infectious Disease Ontology (BIDO), Mycosis Infectious Disease Ontology (MIDO), and Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO), address this need by ensuring that ontological representations align more closely with actual infectious disease datasets, thereby improving their utility for research and clinical applications.\nThe \"hub-and-spoke\u201d approach employed in the development of these ontologies supports modularity and reusability by creating reference ontologies that provide guardrails for more specific extensions. This approach enhances the consistency and quality of the data while also allowing for the reuse of terms and relations across different pathogen types. This cross-pollination of terms between ontologies not only saves time but also fosters more efficient data sharing across the research community.\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain. One significant issue is the need for continuous updates to these ontologies as new pathogens emerge and research priorities shift. While the modular structure of these ontologies facilitates ongoing updates, there remains a need for an organized and standardized mechanism to manage these changes across multiple levels of the ontology. This includes ensuring that updates to terms, definitions, and relationships are consistently implemented across all relevant extensions and ensuring that new terms do not conflict with existing ones. Additionally, as new pathogen-specific ontologies continue to be developed, maintaining interoperability between them and with broader ontologies such as IDO will require ongoing efforts in coordination and governance. This is, indeed, not a new challenge; it is in fact the challenge we are attempting to presently address. Steps forward in this direction include having VIDO, BIDO, MIDO, and PIDO integrated into the OBO Foundry, adopting the workflow procedures of the Ontology Development Kit (ODK) [88], and resuscitating the Infectious Disease Extension (https://github.com/infectious-disease-ontology-extensions) GitHub Organization to coordinate updates and curation.\nAnother challenge is the integration of these ontologies with other bioinformatics tools and resources. While ontologies like IDO and its extensions have great potential to facilitate data integration and knowledge discovery, their adoption depends on how well they are integrated with other systems in the bioinformatics ecosystem. Interoperability with databases, analytical tools, and computational platforms will be essential for ensuring that these ontologies can be effectively used by researchers across various domains."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "The development of pathogen-specific ontologies within the IDO framework represents a significant advancement in the field of infectious disease research. By providing researchers with well-structured, modular ontologies that align with real-world data, these ontologies have the potential to improve data sharing, collaboration, and analysis. Moving forward, continued efforts to refine and expand these ontologies, along with their integration into bioinformatics tools, will be essential for advancing our understanding of infectious diseases and supporting global health research."}]}

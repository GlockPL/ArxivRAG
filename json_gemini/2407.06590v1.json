The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The booming development of the worldwide electric vehicle industry [1] has put forward new requirements for resource conservation, green manufacturing, and low-carbon sustainability. A large number of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries (EOL-EVBs) are in urgent need of disassembly and recycling. The present disassembly process for EOL-EVBs largely relies on manual disassembly lines to address challenges arising from different structures, deformations, and rust corrosion in EVBs. Repetitive tasks, notably the removal of bolts constituting approximately 40% of all disassembly activities [2], result in significant labor costs.\nIn the field of intelligent disassembly, based on the combination of the intelligent vision system and robotic arm, the planning and modular semi-automatic disassembly can be realized [3], [4]. The development of customized cognitive robot systems can solve some of the disassembly work under ideal conditions [5], [6]. Other research has been done to accomplish specific types of bolt disassembly by aiding a priori knowledge through targeted designs [2], [7]. However, challenges such as multiple types, large scale, uncertainty in disassembly scenarios, and unstructured disassembly processes are difficult to be effectively and comprehensively addressed.\nMobile Manipulator Robot(MMR), which consists of a high-precision and compact manipulator and a freely movable chassis, provides new solution ideas for battery disassembly. Currently, depending on the application scenarios, MMR makes significant contributions in multiple fields [8]- [11]. Moreover, the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot (AMMR) demonstrates higher robustness in tasks with static, dynamic, and even unknown environments in industrial scenarios [12]\u2013[14]. Unfortunately, current execution systems using end-to-end networks and high-precision sensors have difficulty in meeting the millimeter-level control accuracy required for battery disassembly [15]. The method based on deep reinforcement learning makes it even more difficult to accurately determine the right position for mobile disassembly [16]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research on battery disassembly systems that can successfully carry out intricate, precise, and dynamic disassembly tasks with strong autonomous decision-making capabilities.\nAiming at this difficulty, based on the NeuralSymbolic AI [17]\u2013[20], this paper designs a battery disassembly autonomous mobile manipulator robot system, BEAM-1, with autonomous perception, automatic planning, precise execution and continuous learning capability. (nickname BEAM, which is composed of 4 letters from Battery disassembly Ammr, that is, battery disassembly autonomous mobile manipulator robot). BEAM-1 possesses humanlike thinking ability, its subjective logic is ensured by symbolic reasoning and knowledge-driven logical framework, and its intuition and perception ability is generated by neural network and probability model. Without any human intervention, BEAM-1 can think in real-time according to the dynamic and complex environment it perceives, plan and execute the optimal"}, {"title": "II. MACRO ARCHITECTURE OF BEAM-1", "content": "As shown in Figurel, the whole system includes four levels: hardware, execution, task, and motion. They are the indispensable parts that make up an AMMR, and also the"}, {"title": "III. CORE TECHNICAL DETAILS", "content": "A dexterous, stable, and agile actuator is essential to meet BEAM-1's disassembly requirements for multiple types of bolts. Our self-designed active and passive compliance electric torque end-effector with multi-sensors are shown in Figure2. The real-time environmental information captured by the ATI multi-axis force/torque sensor and the Intel RealSense RGBD camera will be transformed into a quasi-symbolic representation of the current state via neural predicates. The DC motor will have different rotational speeds and directions in different primitives, providing active compliance for the disassembly primitive sequence and ensuring high-quality bolt engagement. Meanwhile, components such as springs, square shafts, and plain bearings transmit motor torque to the long rod fitted with a sleeve and give passive compliance to the entire end. The selective usage of the magnetic suction module aids in the disassembly of the magnetic bolts.\nIn the fully autonomous disassembly task, when BEAM-1 realizes that the current actuator end sleeve does not match the bolt to be removed, its task planning process will involve primitive \"Change\". Therefore, we designed a stepper motor-controlled rotary quick-change disk as shown in Figure3,"}, {"title": "B. High Precision Control Based on Neural Predicates and Action Primitives", "content": "Most current robotic systems heavily rely on high-precision sensors to perceive their environment. These systems execute predefined programs to perform corresponding robot operations under specific conditions, such as distance parameters. However, this approach fails to address the uncertainty during the battery disassembly process in highly dynamic environments. Different batteries, various bolts, and diverse disassembly scenarios cannot be universally dismantled using a standardized predefined method.\nTo achieve a more intelligent system, we introduce neural predicates to help BEAM-1 for environment state recognition based on the NeuralSymbolic AI. Each neural predicate can be regarded as a neural network, which maps the multi-sensor perception information of the environment to the quasi-symbolic space to complete the characterization of the state. As shown in Fig1(c), we designed seven neural predicates such as target_aim(). Real-time RGBD information and force/torque data are collected and input into pre-trained neural networks for processing. These networks provide probabilities for the corresponding states based on the input data. Neural predicates can be arbitrarily combined to describe the current complex state more accurately. The number of neural predicates can also be expanded to perceive more sophisticated environments. In our current work, we have achieved a 97.75% success rate in recognizing the shape attribute of bolts using the VAE network, 100% accuracy in recognizing the corrosion attribute of bolts, and 100% accuracy in recognizing environmental states such as whether or not aligned by using the VGG network."}, {"title": "C. Heuristic Search Strategy Based on Large Language Model", "content": "The unstructured battery disassembly process introduces more significant challenges, as we cannot predict the required disassembly primitive sequence in advance. To address this, we have developed a task planning system for BEAM-1 based on primitives and predicates.\nAt the task level, BEAM-1 generates the optimal sequence of action primitives from the current state to the goal state in the symbol space using the pre-requirements of the primitives and the current state given by the neural predicates, by using BFS tree search(Figure1(d)). In scenarios with complex tasks, the problem of exploding search space arises during the search for feasible solutions, leading to excessively long computation times. To tackle this issue, we introduce the LLM heuristic search, further enhancing the efficiency of task planning in unstructured environments.\nThe introduction of LLM divides the tree search process into two parts: the Reasoning Engine and the Verification Engine. The three prompting sub-engines of the Reasoning Engine greatly reduce the complexity of the original algorithm(Figure5). Instructions and examples will be entered in advance to declare the task and standardize the output. After inputting the task goal into the Thought generation sub-engine, LLM will generate the next primitives that are most likely to be executed in that state based on the current state. The Feasibility checker sub-engine extracts the action primitives and related information directly from the output of the previous layer and then calls the LLM to determine whether the pre-requirements for the primitives are met. If it can be performed, the primitive is evaluated as \"YES\", otherwise as \"NO\". When the state does not satisfy the pre-requirements, searches along this primitive will be halted, effectively limiting the size of the tree by filtering the feasible actions. It is worth noting that such an approach allows for the feature of few-shot learning on prompt input. Finally, we developed the Effect prediction sub-engine, which predicts the state after completion of the primitive and compares it to the final goal state. This evaluates the effectiveness of each primitive. The effect of a primitive evaluated as \"SURE\" means that it is closer to the final goal than the result of an action evaluated as \"LIKELY\", and is more likely to be retained when choosing the optimal path. Upon completion of the inference, the Verification Engine uses the results of the primitive execution to predict the next moment state. By comparing with the perceived state of the next moment in real-time, the search will be repeated if it does not match. Each layer of the tree performs such a process to achieve real-time autonomy for inference as well as validation, which in turn makes BEAM-1 excellent at handling multiple kinds of bolts and unstructured tasks.\nWe conducted three types of experiments to validate the sophistication and effectiveness of the task planning strategy. Firstly, we observed that the form of the descriptive language (keywords or narrative) does not decisively impact the experimental results within the same model. Secondly, through extensive ablation experiments, we found that the introduction of examples significantly improved the success rate of the algorithm during planning. Finally, in a comparative analysis of different search strategies, the planning success rate exceeded 95.7%, far surpassing the unsupervised, individually primitive planning approach."}, {"title": "D. Intuitively Guided Positional Speculative Sampling", "content": "Dynamic scenarios with a wide range of bolt disassembly tasks require BEAM-1 to have the ability to sample the target position of the mobile chassis.\nThe target position should ensure that the robotic arm is within an appropriate range from the target bolt, and the manipulator's forward and inverse kinematics have a solution. Existing approaches(Figure6(a)) use random sampling to determine where the chassis should move and rely on a kinematic simulation engine to verify whether it is kinematically solvable. This often requires multiple loop sampling simulations and uses significant computational resources. In addition, the deep learning approach (Figure6(b)) requires a significant amount of data acquisition and ground truth labeling work. Once the bolts to be disassembled are on different packs in different locations, the change in dynamic scenarios means that the dataset needs to be recreated.\nTherefore, we equipped BEAM-1 with the RPSN as shown in Figure6(c). We address the problems of function discontinuities and exception throwing during differentiable programming by adding the robot kinematics algorithmic constraints to the computational graph of ANN in a differentiable form. When movement is required, simply enter the pose of the target bolt, the RPSN can quickly give a high-confidence target position of the chassis where there must be a kinematic solution. It is worth emphasizing that the RPSN are trained without ground truth inputs. It relies on a unique form of a loss function to ensure that the anomalies of the differentiable engine become penalties to participate in backpropagation, which allows RPSN independent from specific scenarios and datasets thus able to truly have the ability to reason intuitively heuristically. Numerous experimental data indicate that randomized sampling and deep learning methods require an average of 31.04 times and an average of 3.06 times, respectively, to achieve point sampling that satisfies the kinematic constraints. Whereas the RPSN requires only 1.28 times, and the success rate of a single sample can be up to 96.67%."}, {"title": "E. Continuous Learning", "content": "BEAM-1 can perform environment sensing through multi-sensors with neural predicates, autonomous decision-making through LLM heuristic tree search, position sampling through intuitive speculative networks, and efficient disassembly through high-precision primitives and mechanics. Thus, it exhibits fundamental characteristics of embodied intelligence. Furthermore, BEAM-1 also showcases continuous learning capabilities, as evidenced by:\n1) Execution level: The recognition of states is dependent on neural networks. Therefore, continuous learning can be performed based on multi-sensor cross-validation as camera-guided and force-sensing combined. New neural predicates can be continuously expanded to enhance BEAM-1's perception of different environmental states.\n2) Task level: The efficiency of heuristic search to find optimal primitive sequences can be continuously learned by utilizing LLM in-context learning.\n3) Motion level: The existing RPSN itself is a trainable framework with a complete computational graph. Subsequently, additional physical constraints such as collision detection can be differentially programmed, ensuring the continuous expansion of the intuitive network.\nAs a result, BEAM-1 can continuously learn new knowledge and skills from fresh data and experiences without forgetting previously acquired content. This capability enables it to adapt to various task scenarios, handle diverse sensory data, and address novel challenges. With embodied intelligence and continuous learning abilities, BEAM-1, akin to biological organisms, can achieve higher levels of intelligence and execution through its learning processes."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "content": "Aiming to validate the comprehensive performance under different task requirements and experimental scenarios of the BEAM-1 proposed in this work, we take the bolts on different EOL-EVBs as disassembled objects. Four tasks were designed for the experiments, including replacing the sleeve during disassembly, clearing the obstacles that affect disassembly, continuously disassembling a large number of screws, and disassembling tasks in designated areas, as shown in Figure7. These tasks demand BEAM-1 to autonomously disassemble in dynamic, unpredictable, and complex environments without relying on any pre-programmed logic. This allows a comprehensive evaluation of its hardware design, perception effectiveness, control precision, planning quality, and motion intuition. Each task will emphasize different aspects, with specific execution challenges outlined in the figure. Particularly, in the case of large-scale scenarios where mobile disassembly is required, the movement success rate is also one of the metrics we need to focus on, which directly validates the effectiveness of intuitive sampling of the RPSN.\nThe results show that BEAM-1 can accurately judge the environmental state through neural predicates, intuitively speculate the position through RPSN, generate the task plan in real-time through LLM-based heuristic search strategy, and achieve high-precision disassembly control through carefully designed action primitives and end effectors. These capabilities together constitute the core competitiveness of BEAM-1 in the field of intelligent disassembly, enabling it to cope with various complex challenges.

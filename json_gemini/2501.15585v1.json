Through factor analysis (N=105), we identified two distinct dimensions:\n'Twin Transition' and \u2018Competing Interests'.

As concerns about climate change, injustice,\npeace, and environmental degradation intensify, understanding how AI can contribute to or\npotentially hinder sustainable development has become a central question [1, 8]. Public\nperception of this relationship is crucial in shaping policy, adoption, and implementation of\nAI-driven sustainability solutions [17].\nThis research addresses this methodological gap by developing and validating the\nArtificial Intelligence and Sustainability Perceptions Inventory (AISPI), a new survey\ninstrument designed to measure these specific perceptions.

Eubanks [7] and\nOsasona et al. [19] document persistent concerns about ethical implications, including\nprivacy risks and decision-making transparency. In 2024, the 3M State of Science Index\nshowed that 75% of people globally agreed that AI is an exciting technology. 80% even\nagreed that AI can help build a more sustainable future [20].\nSeveral studies documented that young adults' views on AI are significantly influenced\nby personal experience and knowledge level, suggesting that technological familiarity does\nnot automatically translate to uncritical acceptance [14, 15]. Recent research has shown that\npublic perceptions of AI are multifaceted and deeply rooted in social identity and cultural\ndimensions [12]. Jensen et al. [12] found that ideas about humanness and ethics are central\nto how experts and the general public perceive AI. The public's views are often shaped by\ncomparing Al's characteristics to human capabilities, particularly concerning empathy,\nnuance handling, and agency. Studies indicate that perceptions are influenced by\nfundamental values, social values, economic standings, and demographics [13]. People's\ntrust in Al is contextual - they may appreciate its efficiency in routine tasks but remain\nskeptical about its role in complex situations requiring human judgment. The 3M State of\nScience Survey [20] revealed a paradoxical nature in public perception, where Al is seen\nsimultaneously as an opportunity and a potential threat requiring regulation."}, {"title": "2.2 Society and Sustainable Development", "content": "The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) [24], adopted in 2015,\nrepresent a global framework of 17 interconnected goals addressing humanity's major\nchallenges. These goals span environmental protection (e.g., climate action, life below\nwater), economic development (e.g., decent work and economic growth), and social\nprogress (e.g., quality education, reduced inequalities). While these goals are often\ncategorized into ecological, economic, and social dimensions, the UN emphasizes their\ninterconnected and indivisible nature [24].\nSince their adoption, the SDGs have helped shape public discourse and understanding of\nsustainability challenges, particularly among younger generations. This growing awareness\nis reflected in recent surveys and social movements. \u201cClimate change and environmental\nsustainability related topics feature heavily amongst the problems to solve that have been\ntop of mind for the global public.\u201d [20].

Research indicates that Al\nholds substantial potential for advancing sustainability goals through environmental\nmonitoring, climate prediction, and resource optimization. Vinuesa et al. [25] demonstrate\nAl's capacity to support UN SDGs through improved data-driven decision-making and\nresource optimization. Experts broadly agree that AI can positively contribute to these goals,\nparticularly in climate action and environmental protection.\nHowever, this relationship is complex and sometimes paradoxical. While AI can enhance\nefficiency in resource management and environmental monitoring, important concerns\npersist about its own environmental footprint. Strubell et al. [22] specifically highlight the\nsubstantial energy demands of large-scale machine learning models, raising questions about\nthe net environmental impact of AI deployment. This tension between AI's potential benefits\nand its environmental costs remains understudied from a public perception perspective.\nRecent research has highlighted both the opportunities and challenges in applying Al\ntowards UN SDGs. While AI shows promise for addressing social challenges, successful\nimplementation requires careful consideration of multiple factors. Studies have shown the\nuneven distribution of AI applications across different SDGs [6] and identified key\nrequirements for successful collaborations between Al researchers and domain experts [23].\nThese findings emphasize the importance of a systematic approach that considers both the\ntechnical potential of AI solutions and the practical realities of implementation in social\ncontexts. The need to evaluate whether Al and sustainability initiatives are viewed as\ncompeting or complementary transitions by different stakeholders is particularly relevant,\nas this perception can significantly impact adoption and effectiveness.\nRecent surveys provide insight into public attitudes toward this intersection. The 2023\n3M State of Science survey [20] found that 75% of global respondents believe \"green jobs\"\nare crucial for addressing climate change, with 89% agreeing that science and technological\ninnovation should advance planetary well-being. These findings suggest broad public\nsupport for technological solutions to environmental challenges while also highlighting the\nneed to carefully consider the environmental impact of AI systems.\nThe relationship between AI and sustainability is multifaceted - AI can serve as a tool for\nenvironmental solutions, acts as a direct contributor to environmental challenges through its\nresource demands, and may fundamentally challenge sustainability goals through its societal\nand economic impacts.

This measurement gap is particularly critical given the complex and\nsometimes paradoxical relationship between AI and environmental sustainability\nhighlighted in recent literature [22, 25].\nExisting research suggests that public perceptions of both Al and sustainability are\nmultifaceted and influenced by various factors, including personal experience, cultural\ndimensions, and social identity [12, 13]. However, the lack of a validated measurement\ninstrument has limited our ability to systematically assess how individuals conceptualize the\nrelationship between AI advancement and sustainability efforts. This gap hampers both\nresearch and practice, as understanding these perceptions is crucial for developing and\nimplementing environmentally responsible AI solutions that gain public acceptance.\nThe methodological gap was addressed by developing and validating the AISPI.

After removing this item, the final 13-item scale demonstrated high internal\nreliability (a = .89) while achieving a clearer factor structure.\nThe factor structure of the AISPI was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA).\nThe Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified the sampling adequacy for the analysis, KMO =\n.891, which is well above the acceptable limit of .5. Bartlett's test of sphericity $x^2(78) =$\n709.845, p < .001, indicated that correlations between items were sufficiently large for EFA.\nPrincipal axis factoring was conducted on the 13 items with oblique rotation (Oblimin).\nTwo factors emerged based on the Kaiser criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1.

This level of explained variance meets common\nthresholds in social science research, where 50-60% of total explained variance is typically\nconsidered acceptable (Hair et al., 2019).\nThe pattern matrix showed clear loadings on two distinct factors (see fig. 1).

Our findings reveal several\nkey insights about the instrument's psychometric properties and theoretical implications.\nThe emergence of two distinct factors \u2013 \u2018Twin Transition' and 'Competing Interests' -\ndemonstrates that individuals hold nuanced views about the relationship between AI and\nsustainability. This complexity mirrors recent findings in the literature regarding the\nparadoxical nature of AI's role in sustainability efforts [22, 25], where AI can simultaneously\nserve as both a tool for environmental solutions and a contributor to environmental\nchallenges through its resource demands.\nThe strong factor loadings and acceptable explained variance (52.16%) support the\nconstruct validity of the AISPI, while the high internal consistency (a = .89) indicates that\nthe instrument reliably measures these perceptions. The clear two-factor structure suggests\nthat people can simultaneously recognize both synergies and tensions in the AI-\nsustainability relationship. This is further supported by the moderate positive correlation (r\n= 0.488, p < .001) between Twin Transition and Competing Interests factors, indicating that\nparticipants who strongly recognized the synergistic potential of AI and sustainability were\nalso more likely to acknowledge potential conflicts between these domains. The strong\nreliability of both the adapted SAS (\u03b1 = .90) and AIAS-4 (a = .93) in our study further\nvalidates their integration alongside the AISPI for a comprehensive assessment of attitudes\ntoward AI and sustainability.\nThe two-factor structure of the AISPI advances our theoretical understanding of how\nindividuals conceptualize the relationship between technological advancement and\nenvironmental sustainability. The simultaneous recognition of both synergies and tensions\nsuggests a sophisticated cognitive framework that goes beyond simple positive or negative\nattitudes. This finding aligns with recent research by Jensen et al. [12] showing that public\nperceptions of AI are multifaceted and deeply rooted in broader social contexts. Similar to\nhow Kanzola et al. [13] found that AI perceptions are influenced by fundamental values and\nsocial factors, our findings suggest that people's understanding of Al's role in sustainability\nis equally complex."}, {"title": "6 CONCLUSION", "content": "The validation of the AISPI represents a significant step forward in understanding public\nperceptions of Al's role in sustainability efforts. The instrument's robust psychometric\nproperties and factor structure provide researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for\nassessing these complex perceptions. Through this validation study, it has been\ndemonstrated that the AISPI reliably captures the multifaceted nature of how individuals\nview the relationship between Al advancement and sustainability efforts.\nThe successful validation of the AISPI addresses a crucial gap in the literature by\nproviding researchers with a reliable instrument for measuring these specific perceptions.\nThe emergence of a two-factor structure suggests that future research should consider both\npotential synergies and conflicts when examining public attitudes toward AI in sustainability\ncontexts. This nuanced understanding is particularly important as organizations and\npolicymakers work to implement AI solutions for environmental challenges.\nThe AISPI can serve as a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners\nworking at the intersection of AI and sustainability. For researchers, it provides a validated\ninstrument for investigating how public perceptions influence the acceptance and\nimplementation of AI-driven sustainability initiatives. Policymakers can use the instrument\nto better understand public concerns and support for various AI-sustainability policies,\nenabling more effective communication strategies and evidence-based policy development.\nPractitioners in both AI and sustainability fields can benefit from insights into how their\nwork is perceived and what factors might influence public support or resistance."}]}

LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Recent literature highlights a significant shift in the demographic composition of students in higher education, with a growing percentage of non-traditional students. These students, who often struggling their studies with other responsibilities such as work or family, represent a diverse population that includes part-time learners, older students, veterans, and those pursuing education later in life [3]. This demographic shift has important implications for educational institutions, particularly in fields like cybersecurity, where the demands of the curriculum can be intense. Non-traditional students often face unique challenges, such as limited time for study, less access to peer support, and a need for more flexible learning options [4]. The literature suggests that educational programs must adapt to these changing demographics by offering more personalized and flexible learning environments [5]-[7].\nCybersecurity education faces several significant challenges, particularly in programs with catering to career-changing professionals and diverse student populations. The rapid evolution of technology and threat landscapes makes it difficult for students to keep pace with the latest industry developments, resulting in a disconnect between academic instruction and real-world requirements [8]\u2013[11]. Additionally, the inherent complexity of cybersecurity concepts, such as cryptography and network security, imposes a high cognitive load, particularly for students from non-technical backgrounds [9], [11]. Another critical issue is the integration of hands-on experience with theoretical knowledge, as practical skills are indispensable for addressing real-world cybersecurity problems. Unfortunately, access to hands-on labs, simulations, and real-world scenarios remains limited, especially for non-traditional students, exacerbating the challenge of achieving a balance between theory and application in cybersecurity education [12], [13]. These challenges underscore the need for innovative educational solutions to bridge the gap between academic learning and industry demands.\nIn response to the challenges facing cybersecurity education, current pedagogical practices have evolved to incorporate a range of approaches aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Many programs now emphasize integrated learning models that combine case studies, simulations, and capstone projects, allowing students to apply theoretical concepts in realistic, hands-on environments [14]. The rise of online and hybrid education models has further expanded access, particularly for non-traditional students, by offering flexible, asynchronous learning options that accommodate diverse schedules and learning paces [15]\u2013[17]. Additionally, collaboration with industry partners has become increasingly common, with institutions working closely with companies to align curricula with evolving industry demands. This includes providing internships, co-op programs, and industry-led workshops that enhance students' readiness for the workforce [14], [18].\nVarious enabling technologies have also been explored. Virtual labs and simulations provide students with hands-on experience in controlled environments, offering significant benefits to non-traditional students who may lack access to physical lab facilities [19]-[21]. Advanced learning management systems (LMS) are also widely employed to manage course content, track student progress, and facilitate communication between students and instructors, playing a critical role in the successful implementation of online and hybrid education models [22], [23]. Additionally, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being utilized to create adaptive learning systems capable of tailoring educational content to individual student needs. These systems provide personalized feedback, recommend resources, and adjust task difficulty based on student performance [24], [25]. Moreover, technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) are being leveraged to deliver real-time, up-to-date information, helping students stay current with evolving"}, {"title": "IV.

By leveraging open-source LLM frameworks, CyberMentor provides tailored assistance for student queries, encompassing career guidance, knowledge units, analytical questions, and technical support across various cybersecurity field."}, {"title": "A. Solution Components", "content": "As shown in Fig 3, our model consists of three major components:\n1) Knowledge Base (KB): The Knowledge Base is an organized repository that encompasses a wide array of educational resources within the cybersecurity domain, including course learning materials, knowledge units, career pathways, and certification materials. This component primarily addresses pain points related to accessing updated information, balancing foundational and advanced knowledge, and career-specific knowledge adjustment, as depicted in Fig.2 (P1, P2, P3). A detailed methodology and implementation strategy for the Knowledge Base are discussed in SectionV.\n2) Skill Base (Tools): The Skill Base is a curated suite of technical tools designed to address specific categories of challenges within the cybersecurity field. These tools not only provide hands-on problem-solving capabilities but also incorporate interactive learning modules that are crucial for mastering practical cybersecurity skills. Additionally, the tools are fully customizable, allowing educators and students to tailor the learning experience to meet specific educational goals and individual needs. Addressing pain points such as the need for strong mathematical foundations, algorithm development, and programming challenges, the Skill Base caters to both the analytical and programming skill development of students, as indicated in Fig.2 (P4, P5). Further details on the functionalities and technical implementation of the Skill Base tools are provided in SectionVI and Section VII.\n3) LLM Agent: As proposed by Yao et al. [35], this agentic framework allows LLMs to generate reasoning traces that are interleaved with task-specific actions, effectively synergizing these processes to enhance decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. The LLM Agent functions as the central AI component of our proposed framework, tasked with delivering precise and contextually relevant support to students and solve the pain point related to the efficient and personalized learning experience, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (P6). By intelligently processing user queries, the LLM Agent selects the most suitable resources or tools from the Knowledge Base and Skill Base to provide tailored responses. This approach ensures that students receive accurate assistance using an interactive chat system that is aligned with their specific learning needs. It also employs 24/7 and multi-language processing capabilities, enabling it to interact with students in their native languages, thereby reducing language-related learning barriers and fostering an inclusive educational environment. This is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students and first-generation learners, who often face additional challenges in their academic journey.\nMore detailed real-world examples of these use cases are discussed in Section VIII. The subsequent section will elaborate on the preparation of the knowledge base and skill-based tools that underpin our framework."}, {"title": "V. KNOWLEDGE BASE IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "In fast-evolving fields like cybersecurity, where new threats and techniques emerge regularly, searching for relevant information that reflects the latest knowledge is crucial. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid framework that integrates retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the generation of responses by incorporating relevant external information. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast datasets, their knowledge is inherently limited to the data available at the time of training. As new cyber threats and techniques emerge continuously, relying solely on static training data may lead to outdated or incomplete information. Consequently, it is essential to retrieve up-to-date, domain-specific knowledge beyond the LLM's initial training data to ensure the model's outputs remain both relevant and accurate.\nUnlike traditional databases that require predefined schema and structured queries, RAG dynamically retrieves and integrates information into the generative process. This method allows for more flexible, context-aware, and precise responses, making it particularly advantageous in educational settings where the context and needs of the learners can vary significantly. RAG's ability to seamlessly combine retrieval with generation ensures that the information provided is both relevant and current, addressing the specific demands of cybersecurity education."}, {"title": "A. RAG Workflow", "content": "The RAG workflow (Fig. 4) comprises several critical steps to ensure the relevance and completeness of generated content. First, documents pertinent to the cybersecurity curriculum-such as knowledge units, career pathways, and program catalogs are loaded into the system to provide comprehensive source information aligned with educational goals. These documents are then chunked into smaller, overlapping segments to maintain context between chunks, enabling precise retrieval without sacrificing coherence. Each chunk is converted into a vector representation using an embedding model, capturing the semantic meaning of the content for nuanced retrieval. The embeddings are stored in a vector database (VectorDB), facilitating scalable and efficient retrieval of relevant chunks based on user queries or prompts to the LLM. This setup ensures fast and accurate retrieval, critical for providing real-time feedback as the volume of educational content grows.\nWhen students or educators interact with the system, the most relevant chunks are retrieved from the VectorDB and fed into the LLM, ensuring responses are informed by up-to-date, context-specific information. Additionally, the LLM's responses may include references to original sources, such as URLs or specific sections in books, enhancing credibility and guiding users for further exploration."}, {"title": "B. Documents Selection", "content": "In the context of RAG, documents are external data sources retrieved to enhance the output of LLMs. In this study, we have categorized documents into three primary types: Knowledge Units, Career Pathways, and Program Catalogs. For detailed information on the sources, and specific documents utilized, refer to Table I.\n1) Knowledge Units: These are essential for ensuring that students acquire the foundational skills and knowledge required in cybersecurity. We utilize documents from the National Centers of Academic Excellence (NCAE) and The Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) and the CompTIA Security+ Certification Guide. These sources provide comprehensive frameworks and guidelines that support curriculum standards and competency development across various academic institutions.\n2) Career Pathways: These documents provide structured frameworks for career planning and skill development, crucial for improving student engagement and employment outcomes. Our research leverages materials from the Federal Cyber Career Pathways Working Group, aligned with the NICE Framework, to offer students clear guidance on potential career trajectories within the cybersecurity field.\n3) Program Catalogs: These catalogs offer detailed insights into academic programs, including curriculum, policies, and student services, specific to cybersecurity education.

CODING SKILLS TOOLKIT USING AGENTIC WORKFLOW", "content": "In the domain of cybersecurity, coding skills are also indispensable, particularly in automating tasks and leveraging machine learning techniques for advanced threat detection. Two pivotal aspects of coding in this domain are (1) the development of automated scripts for network anomaly detection and (2) the creation of machine learning models for sophisticated threat analysis. This section discusses how our agentic workflow tools, ScriptCoder and MLClassifier, address these essential needs by guiding students through structured processes that enhance their coding proficiency in cybersecurity contexts."}, {"title": "A. Automated Scripting for Network Anomaly Detection", "content": "Writing scripts using tools like Bash and AWK is essential for network anomaly detection. This is because these scripting tools enable automation of routine tasks, customization of data processing, and real-time analysis, which are crucial for efficiently managing network logs, detecting suspicious patterns, and responding to potential threats. However, students often struggle with scripting due to its complexity and the need to understand diverse network protocols and data sources. Our ScriptCoder tool (Fig. 6) assists students through a step-by-step workflow: it first categorizes the student's query and identifies key concepts such as specific network protocols or types of anomalies; then it determines the relevant data sources pertinent to the task, simplifying the process by focusing on essential components; finally, it generates the appropriate script based on the identified requirements, providing students with a ready-to-use tool and reinforcing their understanding of script construction. For example, if a student aims to detect port scanning activities within a network subnet using AWK, ScriptCoder would classify the problem, specify relevant data sources like network logs, and generate the necessary AWK script. This structured approach ensures that students gain practical scripting experience while deepening their theoretical understanding."}, {"title": "B. Machine Learning for Cybersecurity Threat Detection", "content": "Machine learning plays a transformative role in cybersecurity by enabling the automatic detection and response to complex and evolving threats that traditional methods may fail to address. Writing code for machine learning models is therefore a critical skill, allowing students to analyze large datasets, identify malicious patterns, and adapt to new threats. Our MLClassifier tool (Fig. 7) guides students through a comprehensive workflow for creating machine learning scripts in cybersecurity applications. It begins with problem categorization to ensure students understand the nature of the threat and the appropriate machine learning approach. The tool then assists in data loading and preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning and feature engineering. It helps students select an appropriate machine learning model based on the problem, provides instructions for training the model, and facilitates prediction generation on test data. MLClassifier also outlines methods for evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Finally, it generates the complete Python script with detailed explanations for each step, serving both as a functional tool and an educational resource to help students understand each part of the script. For example, when tasked with detecting fake news, MLClassifier would guide the student through categorizing the problem as a supervised learning task, selecting a dataset, pre-processing the data, choosing and training a SVM classification model, making predictions, and evaluating the results. The tool would then generate a full Python script that the student can use and modify, enhancing their coding skills and their understanding of machine learning applications in cybersecurity."}, {"title": "VIII.

EVALUATION", "content": "One of the known challenges of leveraging Generative LLMs is their tendency to suffer from hallucination, where the model generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or irrelevant information. This issue poses a risk to educational applications, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. Therefore, the evaluation of our proposed framework is a crucial aspect of this study, as it determines the effectiveness of utilizing Generative LLMs in cybersecurity education. To achieve a comprehensive assessment, we employed three key score metrics-helpfulness, correctness, and completeness. These metrics ensure that the model's output not only provides relevant and valuable information but also aligns with accurate facts and logical reasoning. Helpfulness was assessed based on whether the answer effectively addressed the question, correctness was evaluated by checking the consistency of the response with a reference answer, and completeness measured whether all parts of the query were sufficiently answered.\nOur evaluation utilized a dataset of 115 cybersecurity-related questions across three domains: knowledge-based, cryptography, and coding. These questions were sourced from industry interview questions, academic exercises, and practical problem-solving tasks. The diversity in question types ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's proficiency in both theoretical knowledge and technical skills. For detailed sources, please refer to our repository7. To evaluate the performance, we utilized a LangChain prompt-based evaluation methodology, which involved an independent LLM to cross-validate the performance of the responses.\nThe results (Table II) highlight that the framework achieved an overall average score of 0.85 for helpfulness, 0.83 for correctness, and 0.90 for completeness, signifying robust performance across different categories. The framework particularly excels in addressing cybersecurity-related interview questions, achieving a high correctness score (0.91) and an overall helpfulness score (0.94). These results validate the efficacy of the RAG methodology, which ensures that answers are sourced from extensive, relevant knowledge bases. By retrieving specific information tailored to the context of the question, the system successfully supports students in preparation for technical interviews, which are critical in their career development. In the coding-related tasks, the correctness score (0.89) suggests that it performs particularly well in practical, skill-based learning environments. This is especially notable for its role in guiding students through complex coding exercises and machine learning implementations, areas where skill proficiency is essential for both academic success and career readiness.\nHowever, the framework exhibited some limitations in the cryptography domain, where it scored a correctness of 0.63. This lower performance is consistent with known difficulties LLMs face when tackling complex mathematical concepts. Current LLMs often struggle with tasks requiring precise mathematical reasoning, particularly in areas like cryptography. This gap indicates that while LLMs can be extremely effective in retrieving and presenting knowledge-based content, their capacity for handling intricate mathematical operations remains a challenge. As LLM architectures continue to evolve, improvements in handling such tasks are expected, potentially enhancing performance in mathematically intensive fields like cryptography. Despite these limitations, the overall completeness of the framework's responses remains strong, with an average score (0.90) across all categories. The high completeness scores reflect the framework's ability to answer all components of a question comprehensively, ensuring students receive thorough explanations. This is particularly important in an educational setting, where fragmented or incomplete answers could lead to misunderstandings and hinder learning progress."}, {"title": "X.

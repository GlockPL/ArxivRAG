INTRODUCTION", "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that facilitates direct interaction between humans and computers [1], [2]. This technology reclaims a novel way in neuroscience research by providing the approach to analyze brain signals associated with the activation of specific brain regions [3]. In addition, electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the non-invasive techniques for monitoring complex brain dynamics without the need for surgery [4], [5]. EEG-based BCI systems have advantages including low-cost and high portability, which are promising for a wide range of applications such as a speller [6], a robotic arm [7], a wheelchair [8], or a drone [9].\nThe high temporal resolution of EEG signals enables real- time reflection of the human's cognitive state and intentions. This modality exhibit characteristics that are especially advan- tageous for various BCI paradigms, such as motor imagery (MI) [10]. MI is a useful paradigm for controlling external electronic devices without physical movement [11]. It is receiving more attention in the fields of rehabilitation and assistive technology [12]. However, EEG signals suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio and various physiological artifacts, making it difficult to extract distinct features and analyze brain signals [13]. Furthermore, EEG signals exhibit inherent variability, with more pronounced differences observed across individuals [14].\nTo solve these problems, a large number of methodolo- gies have been developed in recent years. Among them, the convolutional deep architectures are commonly employed as feature extractors to capture the significant features from MI tasks. Barmpas et al. [15] proposed the dynamic convolu- tional approach based on causal reasoning to mitigate the inter-subject variability in decoding MI-based EEG signals, resulting in up to 5 % improvement in generalization across subjects. Tang et al. [16] focused on improving the classi- fication performances of EEG signals in MI domain, which extracts various temporal and spatial features by the multi- scale convolutional framework, achieving the average accuracy of 96.87 %. The convolution-based methods have shown impressive results in MI domain. However, EEG signals could contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics. Since the convolutional operation is limited to local receptive fields, a potential challenge arises in which weights of the deep model could become biased towards features with low correlation to MI characteristics.\nIn this paper, we proposed the end-to-end deep preprocess- ing method that enhances the relevant MI characteristics while attenuating those with low correlation to MI characteristics. It was designed to be robustly integrated into the initial layers of the convolution-based methods. To extract the discriminative features for each MI characteristic, our proposed method was composed of the temporal and spatial convolutional layers. Additionally, we introduced the graph-based convolutional"}, {"title": "II. MATERIALS AND METHODS", "content": "We utilized a dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV (BCIC2a) [17], which is the well-known public dataset commonly employed in the MI domain, to validate our experiments. BCIC2a consists of 22 electrodes EEG signals from nine subjects (A1-A9) at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. This dataset was collected from subjects performing four distinct tasks, including left hand (\"L\"), right hand (\u201cR\u201d), feet (\u201cF\u201d), and tongue (\"T\") with two sessions recorded on different days. Each session includes a total of 288 trials, with 72 trials per MI task. Specifically, we segmented the EEG data from 0 to 2 seconds as rest and from 2 to 6 seconds as MI signals."}, {"title": "B. The Proposed Method", "content": "To address the problem of bias towards features with low correlation to MI characteristics, we proposed the prepro- cessing method for signals. In this paper, the term of \"rest\u201d is defined as the entire period excluding the period of MI tasks. The proposed method was designed to attenuate features that exhibit high similarity to rest characteristics in the entire temporal period of MI signals. Additionally, in the spatial aspect, the graph-based approach was introduced to learn the relationships between electrodes at different time points [18]. Fig. 1 showed the overall process of the proposed method. The proposed method was composed of four main components, including the temporal, spatial, graph, and similarity blocks. In the temporal and spatial blocks, each block employed a convolutional layer to extract significant features related to temporal and spatial information, respectively. Each kernel size was set to 1 \u00d7 F/32 in the temporal block and C \u00d7 1 in the spatial block, where F denotes the sampling rate and C indicates the number of electrodes. The number of temporal and spatial kernels was set to 16. To prevent the weight bias problem during the feature extraction process, a batch normalization layer was applied after each convolutional layer. Additionally, we utilized the exponential linear unit (ELU) as an activation function and the dropout to avoid the overfitting problem after the convolutional layer in the spatial block.\nThe graph block was designed between the temporal and spatial blocks to globally learn the relationships between electrodes from extracted temporal features. The graph-based convolutional operation was applied only to the rest features to more effectively attenuate features similar to rest character- istics in MI features. The graph-based convolutional operation is formulated as:\n\n$\\begin{aligned} A &= A + I, \\ D &= \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^C a_{i j}\\right)^{-1}\\right), \\ X^{\\prime} &= \\sigma\\left(D A D^T\\right) X, \\end{aligned}$\n\nwhere A \u2208 $\\mathbb{R}^{C\u00d7C}$ and I \u2208 $\\mathbb{R}^{C\u00d7C}$ are the adjacent matrix and the identity matrix, respectively. A is the adjacent matrix with the added self-loop. D \u2208 $\\mathbb{R}^{C\u00d7C}$ denotes the diagonal matrix representing the degree of A, which is used to normalize the adjacent matrix. \u03c3 is the sigmoid function as the activation function, and it is used to indicate electrodes with high correlation with rest characteristics as the attention. X' and X are the node embedding and feature vectors of rest signals, respectively.\nIn the similarity block, we utilized the negative cosine similarity method to find similar features to rest characteristics within MI signals. We averaged the node embedding vectors"}, {"title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "We used the average accuracy (avg.) and the standard deviation (std.) across all subjects as evaluation metrics. In the evaluation environment, the leave-one-subject-out cross- validation [22] was adopted to confirm the classification per- formances in the cross-subject environment. Additionally, we conducted the ablation study on three conventional models (the DeepConvNet [19], the M-ShallowConvNet [20], and the EEGNet [21]) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in Table I. The DeepConvNet was designed to automatically extract features at various scales by the deep layer structure. The M-ShallowConvnet optimized the layer structure of the ShallowConvNet [19] to alleviate bottlenecks in the training phase. The ShallowConvNet was proposed to capture both temporal and spatial features of EEG signals, which is inspired by the common spatial pattern method. The EEGNet was designed to be robust across various BCI paradigms with the compact structure. The common attribute of these models is the ability to learn features for each frequency band and effectively combine the features extracted from different frequency bands.\nIn Table I, the bold text represented high performances when the proposed method was integrated into the conventional models and compared to the results of the classification performances. The DeepConvNet, the M-ShallowConvNet, and the EEGNet showed the performances (avg.(std.)) of 62.35(7.35) %, 68.67(11.07) %, and 69.08(6.24)%, respectively. These results indicated that when the proposed method was integrated into the DeepConvNet and M- ShallowConvNet, the performances (avg.(std.)) were improved by 2.86(0.02) % and 3.78(0.32) %, respectively. However, in the case of the EEGNet, we observed a decrease in the performances (avg.(std.)) by 0.11(0.17) %. We assumed that the EEGNet was designed more compactly compared to other conventional models, resulting in fewer parameters, which could lead to the limited capacity to learn diverse features. Specifically, it suggested that the EEGNet might be insufficient to effectively learn the discriminative features of signals processed by the proposed method compared to raw signals."}, {"title": "B. Feature Visualization", "content": "To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we additionally visualized the difference of the feature distributions by the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), as shown in Fig. 2. We designed the proposed method to be placed at the front of the layers in the conventional models and conducted the comparison of the feature distributions between the cases w/ and w/o our proposed method. The representative subject was selected as A5, who showed common improvement in three conventional models. As an experimental result, the conventional models indicated improved boundary separation for each MI task compared to the performances without the proposed method. Although the EEGNet indicated similar variations in the performances, these results suggested that the feature distributions were effectively clustered for subjects with the improved classification accuracy. However, the feature distributions of some MI tasks continued to overlap in three conventional models. We regarded that solely relying on the encoder based on the conventional models in the cross-subject environment has difficulty in extracting the generalized features. Therefore, we confirmed that raw MI signals contain features with low correlation to MI characteristics, which negatively affect the classification accuracy. Our proposed method can obtain the discriminative feature distributions, attenuating features with low correlation to MI characteristics. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the proposed method could be robustly integrated with the conventional models in the MI domain."}, {"title": "IV. CONCLUSTION", "content": "In this paper, we introduced the end-to-end deep preprocessing method to enhance MI characteristics in EEG-based BCI systems.

We used BCIC2a widely adopted in MI domain to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results showed the improved performances when our proposed method was integrated into the conventional models. In particular, the EEGNet, which had few differences between the cases w/ and w/o our proposed method, indicated discriminative boundary separation for subjects with the improved performances. However, the encoders based on the conventional models tend to show the low generalization ability for some MI tasks. In future works, we will conduct the experiment using other public datasets to confirm the robustness of our proposed method. Also, we will develop algorithms that can provide more generalized feature extraction from EEG signals related to MI tasks. Therefore, We believe that our study to enhance features of complex brain dynamics has contributed to the progress of BCI systems."}]}

This includes a young population, its often-rural nature and the rich mix of diverse ethnic groups, cultures, religions, and languages. Given this, the African context presents both unique opportunities and challenges, when we consider the potential of Generative Al to positively transform work. This is compounded by the fact that the performance of Generative Al models depends on the amount and quality of training data, yet the majority of the training data for existing generative Al models is sourced from the predominantly English-speaking Global North and as such does not well represent African social and cultural realities.\nThe impact of Al on the future that emerges will be a consequence of many things, including technological and policy decisions made today. Getting to a better future will require carefully designed policies and regulations that foster the development of Al while keeping the negative effects in check. This section discusses the potential impacts of Generative Al on three broad areas of macroeconomic interest: productivity growth, labour markets and income inequality, and industrial concentration. It outlines how if leaders wish to maximize the benefits and mitigate the macroeconomic risks related to Generative Al, they must invest in digital infrastructure and human capital - including education initiatives - whilst ensuring that Al development is inclusive and tailored to the continent's unique needs and challenges. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure that Al acts as a catalyst for equitable and sustainable growth in Africa.\nAfrica's young population and vibrant tech ecosystem provide significant opportunities to position Africa as a leader in technological innovation and sustainable development. The section explores the different potential outcomes on labour markets of the deployment of Generative Al \u2013 from the potential to enable African youth to forge ahead to potential labour market disruption potentially increasing income inequality. It highlights the need for research which moves beyond the usual generalizations to apply a critical lens to understand the nuances of the repercussions of Generative Al in Africa's unique social and economic contexts. It highlights the importance of:\n\u2022 Language. Whilst African languages are increasingly represented in large language models (LLMs), they lag behind English performance substantially and currently only a small number are well represented. However, LLMs do perform much better with code-mixed and naturally produced language than previous language technologies, opening up the possibility of better tools in domains such as healthcare and agriculture. However, speech models currently lag behind.\n\u2022 Culture and context. African culture and context are also notably underrepresented in Generative Al training data, leading to poor performance in African workplaces. Representative African data is key to building models which work in African contexts, and this means creating equitable data ecosystems, and incorporating indigenous knowledge in culturally and socially sensitive ways.\n\u2022 Data. The importance of data justice and data sovereignty is highlighted as central to Globally Equitable Generative Al."}, {"title": "Introduction", "content": "This white paper is the result of a multidisciplinary workshop that took place in Nairobi on 3rd November 2023, where diverse thought-leaders from various sectors and backgrounds discussed the implications of generative Al for the future of work in Africa. The workshop was organized by a core committee including Jacki O'Neill (Microsoft Research Africa, Nairobi), Winnie Karanu (Microsoft Philanthropies), Vukosi Marivate (University of Pretoria and Lelapa Al), Wesley Rosslyn Smith (University of Pretoria), Barbara Glover (NEPAD), Charity Wayua, Matthew Grollnek (Mastercard Foundation), and Anne Makena (Oxford University).\nThe workshop explored four topics: 1) Macroeconomic impacts, 2) Jobs, skills and labour markets, 3) Workers' perspectives on Al, and 4) Africa Centric Al platforms. This white paper presents the insights and recommendations from these four topics, each written by a different group of contributors.\nThe white paper aims to provoke discussion and action on whether and how Generative Al can shape the future of work in Africa and how Africa can be at the forefront of designing a dignified future of work for all. The sections of the white paper are complementary but also reflect the diversity of perspectives and backgrounds of the authors. We hope that this diversity will spark further conversations and collaborations on this important topic.\nGenerative Al refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that involves systems capable of creating new content, such as images, text, or even entire datasets. Unlike traditional Al, which relies on explicit programming, generative models are trained on large datasets to learn patterns and generate novel outputs. While there have been many discussions about the potential impact of Al on work in Africa, this paper focuses specifically on Generative Al because it promises to make computing and Al more accessible to a wider range of people.\nThe ability of generative Al to process natural language and generate new content makes it highly usable for a wide audience across various tasks. For example, users can interact with these models conversationally \u2013 asking questions, giving commands, and completing tasks. In the future, this capability could lead to a reduction of complexity across applications and devices, by allowing users to create and find content using natural language without needing to open different applications or even know which tool was used to create the content. Large Language Models (LLMs) could reduce the burden of repetitive and non-essential tasks, such as crafting emails, summarizing documents, and supporting report writing, thereby giving people more time to focus on the work they love. Additionally, multimodal interactions involving image, speech, and video processing and generation further enhance the transformational power of these tools. This could bring Al, and computing more generally, to a wider range of users, including mobile-first or mobile-only users - reaching the billions of people who do not work at desks.\nAs a result, generative Al is likely to transform the future of work across the globe in ways as yet unimagined and has sparked excitement about its potential impact on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, generative Al may not be equally useful for everyone, and its impact will not necessarily be evenly distributed globally across regions, communities, and demographics. There is a risk of compounding existing systemic inequalities, especially given the imbalances in the training data and data-related processes that typically prioritize data from the Global North.\nIt is challenging to predict how work will evolve in the next two to ten years. One of the most exciting aspects of this time is that we are at the beginning of this transformation. It is rare to have the opportunity to influence the technologies that will shape our world from the start. Generative Al represents a significant advancement for Al, but it is also very young. The true transformation will come from the multitude of applications built on top of these models.\nWe have a unique opportunity in Africa to influence what the future of work looks like in these early days when things are not fixed. The question is, what kind of future of work do we want? What do we want technology to do and not do? What does it mean to create a dignified and happy future of work, inclusive of everyone, for both the current and future generations?\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked a global conversation about its benefits and impact on the future of work. In African contexts, this conversation brings unique perspectives due to the continent's rich cultural diversity and rapidly changing economic landscape.\nAfrica is home to about 1.4 billion people, representing 18% of the world's population, and has the youngest median age of any continent at around 19 years old. Unlike the Global North, which has a high median age and a low growth rate, Africa's population is predicted to double by 2050.\nThe following sections of the white paper discuss generative Al and the future of work in Africa with a focus on four topics:"}, {"title": "Macroeconomic Impacts", "content": "Generative Al is expected to have a transformative and lasting effect on economies at a global scale. Africa will not be an exception; however, the integration of Generative Al in Africa presents a unique landscape of both opportunities and risks, impacting macroeconomic growth over the next decade.\nDespite stagnant or waning growth across the continent over the last ten years, analysts suggest that Africa has the human capital and resources it needs to propel economic growth and increase productivity across all sectors, particularly the services sector. Africa's population is expected to nearly double to 2.5 billion people by 2050\u00b9 which would make her home to the youngest population on earth. Sound macroeconomic policies can ensure that this demographic dividend is fully realised. Additionally, Africa offers trillion-dollar private sector investment opportunities, including in the climate and green growth sectors2.\nThe overall impact of Generative Al on macroeconomic development in Africa is yet unknown and multiple scenarios abound, ranging from overly optimistic to exceptionally pessimistic. Experts assess that Al, including Generative Al\u00b3, has the potential to impact three broad areas of macroeconomic interest: productivity growth, labour markets and income inequality, and industrial concentration.\nBoosting productivity growth is arguably one of the world's most fundamental economic challenges. But disagreements persist about the extent to which Al will boost productivity, both globally and in Africa. It is estimated that in South Africa alone productivity increase from Generative Al could account for 0.5% of the GDP growth due to automation6.\nAl is most likely to improve productivity in capital-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing and transport, and sectors where routine tasks lend themselves to automation 78.\nAl could also help to revolutionize agriculture in Africa, a key sector for most countries across the continent, by accelerating precision farming, improving crop yields and sustainable farming practices, enhancing value and supply chains, expanding access to export markets, and boosting the sector's contribution to GDP. With half of Africa's workforce still employed in farming, boosting agricultural productivity and farmer incomes remains critical. There are around 250 million small-holder farmers across Africa who provide 75% of the food for the continent. Tools such as SMS chatbots to help small-holder farmers with weather, planting, disease and so on have been around for some time10. However, with Generative Al's advances in supporting natural language interaction in several African languages the possibility of providing such services at scale becomes more likely in the coming years.\nreaching populations traditionally excluded from formal banking systems. Al might also be leveraged to optimise trade processes, currency valuation, and stabilise regional and national economies, promoting fair trade and sustainable development across the continent.\nEven if workers in some low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have access to individual technologies, the lack of basic infrastructure in many locales - such as affordable and consistent internet and energy access - could limit the potential benefits of technological change for firms and individuals alike and amplify productivity gaps12.\nDespite improvements in the business regulatory environment, informality in Africa has persisted over the last two decades, remaining, on average, at around 75 percent of total employment13.\nWhat might the growth and expansion of an African Al industry, comprising both foreign and indigenous firms look like?\nIn one scenario, the industrial concentration of Al across multiple sectors could increase, with only the largest firms (and predominantly those in the Global North) intensively using Al in their core business."}, {"title": "Takeaways and Recommendations", "content": "There is no consensus on whether and to what extent the risks related to Generative Al and the future of work will materialise. The potential for Al to support macroeconomic growth in Africa could be significant, particularly in sectors like agriculture, healthcare, services, and manufacturing. However, this potential comes with significant risks, including labour displacement and greater industrial concentration with an increasing dependence on technology firms in the Global North. Neither outcome is a given.\nThe impact of Al on the future that emerges will be a consequence of many things, including technological and policy decisions made today. Getting to a better future will require carefully designed policies and regulations that foster the development of Al while keeping the negative effects in check. To maximize the benefits and mitigate the macroeconomic risks related to Generative Al, leaders must also invest in digital infrastructure and human capital - including education initiatives - whilst ensuring that Al development is inclusive and tailored to the continent's unique needs and challenges. Addressing these issues is essential to ensure that Al acts as a catalyst for equitable and sustainable growth in Africa."}, {"title": "Jobs, Skills and Labour Markets", "content": "Africa's rapidly growing population and vibrant tech ecosystem provide significant opportunities, particularly through the emergence of startups, tech hubs, and collaborative projects that drive digital transformation. The youthful energy and widespread availability of digital tools in sectors from agriculture to finance are catalyzing the continent's dynamism and can position Africa as a leader in technological innovation and sustainable development.\nThe young demographic could provide a powerful driver for employment, development and economic growth. However, a recent report highlighted the challenge for African countries in creating jobs and equipping young people with the necessary skills for economic advancement\u00b9. Against this backdrop, advances in Generative Al are expected to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, there is potential to employ relevant technologies to markedly increase access to education, training and skilling and ensure African youth can forge ahead. On the other hand, current and expected disruptions in the labour markets could deepen the unemployment rates across the continent and entrench the already unsustainable social and economic inequalities. These concerns are grounded in past experiences of historic exclusions2, which if not addressed are likely to continue to play out as Generative Al unfolds.\nIn addition, the ready availability of off-the-shelf generative Al tools for anyone to use anywhere, as long as they have an internet-enabled device and data, could enable a greater disruption of African markets than predicted. Although device and internet availability and affordability are still a challenge especially for rural populations. It is likely that disruption will therefore be skewed \u2013 potentially with big city based small businesses willing and able to adopt Generative Al tools, whilst businesses elsewhere are more likely to be excluded.\nAs demonstrated in the next section on Workers Perspectives, the biggest impact from Generative Al is likely to be found in information work which already has some level of digitization. This includes work in both the knowledge and frontline work sectors, and includes supporting communications, such as emails and presentations; creating sales and marketing materials, from posters to digital flyers; ideation, planning and so on. It is most likely to be used, at first, in the formal and semi-formal sectors. Over time, Generative Al may well become embedded in more diverse sectors and systems \u2013 such as agriculture, healthcare, financial inclusion as more sector specific applications are created.\nGlobally, in the short term, various workforces are likely to require cycles of skilling, reskilling and upskilling to match the fast pace of Generative Al evolution and the rapid discovery of new use cases. This requires a rethinking of how we do 'on the job' learning, what career paths will look like and how any worker and workforce can keep pace during this rapid period of change. However, it is important to be careful about how we define and understand skilling15. As the ways in which Generative Al changes work and workplaces becomes clearer, the sets of new skills necessary for different jobs will also become clearer. Of course, the best technology fits into people's natural work practices, offering new opportunities and possibilities and transforms work more organically16."}, {"title": "Takeaways and Recommendations", "content": "Recommendations drawn from the deliberations can been categorised into four parts.\nBuilding and deploying Al. There are a variety of factors which could limit the participation of African countries, academia and industry in developing new large language and multi-modal models22. This lack of representation, compounded by the data divide (see 'Workers Perspectives' section) already results in instances of biased and exclusive Al outputs from Al systems when faced with African contexts and languages. It is therefore vital that all organisations which develop and apply Generative Al models within African countries, do so with a sensitivity to the varied contexts that exist. Fostering research (including humanities and social sciences), technology, human-centred design and engineering skills across the entire Al value chain in Africa would enable the creation of more inclusive and representative Al technologies. It is important to stress that social science, humanities, and human- and community-centred design are as important in building Al in and for Africa as anywhere else. Without including these disciplines in a central role for Al design the majority of challenges around inclusiveness and representativeness of Al are unlikely to be addressed.\nWorking with Al. In addition, skills for working with Al and Al-assisted jobs are needed, alongside the people-centric, transferrable skills that have always been essential for success in the workplace. Not specific to African workers, but required globally, these include creativity, agile thinking, communication, integrity and judgement. These skills are likely to remain relevant for jobs involving Al. While these universal skills can be taught experientially, they require alignment with community values and culture.\nGiven the widespread reports of the deplorable working conditions of low-wage data annotators across the continent, it is evident that the Al sector is likely to replicate existing extractive and often unethical labour practices in Africa23. It is important that Africa is not relegated to being the hidden army of low skilled Al data workers 24 preparing and annotating training datasets. Even with exceptional training and capacity development, the unpredictability and uncertainty of Al disruption renders millions of currently stable employees at risk. This race to the bottom can only harm African workers and needs to be remedied through global voluntary and statutory policy action 25. Because of the global labour market26 that all digital work finds itself in, any attempt to improve standards in one country can simply cause jobs to flow to another country with weaker protections. As such, there is a need for global standards that firms in production networks adhere to.\nAfrican Union digital strategies for education, agriculture, and health provide a foundation on which to reframe and build Africa's Al strategy and policy frameworks. While the African Union strategy for Al is underway, national and regional frameworks need to be developed and implemented to provide relevant skills and protect workers from exploitation. In the absence of these policies, competitive market dynamics of the global Al supply chain are likely to result in price wars, in particular around labour, making workers susceptible to exploitation and abuse."}, {"title": "African Workers' Perspectives on Generative Al", "content": "In this section we examine workers' perspectives around the use of Generative Al, with a focus on the intersection of Generative Al with language, context, culture, and data. African workers encompass a wide variety of people in a range of jobs from frontline work to information work. In Africa, 85.8 percent of employment is informal', and the International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 95% of African youth ages 15-24 work in an informal setting\u00b2. Street vendors, taxi drivers, hairdressers, metal workers and repair shops are some examples of the urban informal sector\u00b3. Entrepreneurialism is common and many workers have multiple jobs or side hustles - including professionals in the formal sector. Within the start-up ecosystem and the formal sector of many African countries, there is a well-developed knowledge economy with strong linkages to global capital. Governments across Africa's 54 African Union recognized countries are a significant employer with armies of workers of various capabilities spanning many disciplines. Finally, a large segment of workers who exist outside or marginally within the market economy exist in academia, civil society and across homes all across the continent.\nIn terms of skills and the African worker, four key elements emerge:\nGiven the above, we can loosely classify the accessibility of Generative Al tools to workers:\nAt least initially, the biggest impact of Generative Al is likely to be on information work \u2013 especially where workers are working on digital tools at a desk. Types of work include content creation and management; research and data analysis; library and archival services e.g. digitisation of collections to make them more accessible and to preserve them; educational resources, especially in higher education; information dissemination e.g. to help draft public announcements and information; and legal and statutory requirements e.g. document review. In several sectors, Generative Al can help with marketing and customer engagement using targeted campaigns, operational efficiency through automation of routine tasks, and customer support services that are available 24/7.\nWhilst these advances are certainly promising for African workers, there's still much to be done to achieve parity with high-resource languages\u00b9\u00b9. Moreover, voice interfaces, preferred in many African contexts due to oral culture and varying literacy levels, lag behind. Current speech-to-text models struggle with multilingualism and accents, creating barriers to broader Generative Al application in the African workplace.\nAddressing these representation gaps is essential for creating Al tools that are truly beneficial and relevant for African business, however, as discussed, this requires innovation and policy to ensure equitable data ecosystems."}, {"title": "Takeaways and Recommendations", "content": "To realize a vision of Al tailored for Africa, several unique features must be considered:\nExisting generative Al technologies often embody Western perspectives, given that they are conceived of and built in the Global North. There is an opportunity to rethink this and embrace communal decision-making and community-oriented values. For example, taking into account data ownership and governance modalities that draw from Africa's community-centric ethos, and which work to counteract and avoid extractive practices, are likely to be beneficial to communities globally. What would Africa-centric models, which balance the needs of communities and individuals look like? What type of innovations around data ecosystems could arise from taking a less extractive perspective? Some places to look for inspiration include Sabelo Mhlambi's work on Ubuntu as an Ethical and human rights Al framework\"; and the African Union's charter on Human and People's rights18 which emphasizes the individual and community aspect to rights and introduces much overlooked language on duties/responsibilities to balance assertions of rights. The methods and algorithms created in building models to reflect such concerns are likely to be globally relevant and beneficial.\nAl models must be trained on data reflective of Africa's vast cultural and linguistic diversity, overcoming the current bias towards Western contexts. This will ensure Al's effectiveness and relevance across the continent. More equitable data ecosystems need to be created to enable this."}, {"title": "Africa-Centric Al Tools and Platforms", "content": "Africa-centric Al refers to the design, development, validation and deployment of Al solutions with a strong focus on African contexts starting from problem definition and resource distribution. By leveraging local expertise and context, Africa-centric Al endeavors to foster innovation and collaboration, unlocking opportunities for prosperity across the continent. The emergence of Africa-centric Al tools and platforms addresses unique socio-economic and demographic opportunities and challenges by tailoring Al solutions to the continent's specific needs. These initiatives aim to improve access to essential services and drive economic growth.\nAs digital transformation takes root across Africa, the emergence of Al technologies brings a spectrum of opportunities that can catalyze progress across various sectors. The growing performance of generative Al, particularly language models, could play a significant role in utilising the continent's rich tapestry of languages and cultures, a unique challenge that Generative Al can convert into an asset. For example, an Al system could provide personalised fertiliser recommendations for a farmer in the rural parts of Africa, tailored to her/his farm conditions and expected climate patterns, but also using the farmer's mother tongue. Similar examples could be drawn in the education sector, where a student anywhere in Africa could access a personalised educational resource, including a tutor, in the student's native language. By enabling real-time translation and content localisation, Al can ensure that linguistic diversity becomes a conduit for inclusion rather than division. This can revolutionise education and information access, leading to increased literacy and a more informed populace.\nConversely, in a world where Al is harnessed for the greater good, technology can act as an equaliser. Al can democratise access to information and services, providing customised education and healthcare, regardless of geographical location or socioeconomic status. The workforce would transition smoothly from jobs vulnerable to automation to those that Al cannot, or should not, replicate - jobs requiring human creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving.\nThe trajectory towards either of these futures is determined by the actions taken today. Ensuring a beneficial outcome with Generative Al involves proactive governance, inclusive design, investment in education, and a commitment to regulatory and ethical standards. The choice of which world we steer towards is a collective responsibility, requiring engagement from policymakers, technologists, and citizens alike. It is through thoughtful stewardship of Al technologies that we can aim for a future where such technologies serve to uplift and unite rather than divide and degrade."}, {"content": "Firstly, integrating Al into the workforce must be underpinned by a commitment to ethical development, transparency, and bias mitigation. This approach will ensure that Al systems are designed to enhance human capabilities without discrimination, fostering an inclusive environment where Al tools are accessible to all individuals. Moreover, the educational sphere must cultivate lifelong learners who possess not only technical skills but also essential human traits such as creativity, empathy, and ethical judgement. Ethical considerations are key to incorporating the Africa-related cultures and sources of knowledge into the Al framework.\nRobust regulatory oversight is essential to govern the ethical deployment of Al, balancing innovation with safeguards against potential misuse that could harm the job market or infringe upon worker rights. Additionally, the potential disruption of certain job sectors by Al necessitates the strengthening of social safety nets to support individuals whose jobs are transformed by Al, ensuring a dignified transition. This journey towards a positive future with Al requires a collaborative effort involving governments, businesses,\nan ongoing conversation about the implications of Al for work, enriched by education on its capabilities and limitations, will help set realistic expectations and prepare society for the transitions ahead. Policymakers must anticipate the waves of change Al will bring and craft policies that encourage companies to invest in human-centric Al, guiding us toward a future where work is not just about productivity but about the potential for every individual to thrive alongside intelligent machines.\nExpanding the grassroots Al communities in Africa. Compared to other regions where the Al ecosystem is shaped by big corporations or strong policies and regulation frameworks, Africa's Al ecosystem is dominated by grassroots movements, such as 'Deep Learning Indaba' and 'Data Science Africa'. Amplifying the work of and collaborating with these grassroots communities is critical to ensure the adoption of trustworthy Al in Africa."}]}

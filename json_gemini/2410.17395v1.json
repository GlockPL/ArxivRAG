The chip achieves 50% sparsity in a quantized 1D CNN using a sparse processing element (SPE) ar-chitecture. Measurement on the prototype chip TSMC 40nm CMOS low-power (LP) process for the VA classification task demonstrates that it consumes 10.60 \u00b5W of power while achieving a performance of 150 GOPS and a diagnostic accuracy of 99.95%. The computation power density is only 0.57 \u00b5W/mm\u00b2, which is 14.23\u00d7 smaller than state-of-the-art works, making it highly suitable for implantable and wearable medical devices.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are critical types of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), which are leading causes of sud-den cardiac death and significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. For individuals at high risk of sudden cardiac death, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) serve as a crucial safeguard by providing timely detection and appropriate defibrilla-tion treatment during life-threatening VAs. However, the detection methods employed by current ICDs remain rudimentary, relying on outdated rule-based methods that have not seen significant advance-ments in decades. While AI-based detection techniques [2-4] have demonstrated considerable promise in the realm of heart disease, a critical challenge that hinders their practical application in em-bedded implantable devices is the need for real-time response with precise detection in resource-limited platforms. This prompts an urgent need to develop and implement neural network (NN) accel-erators that offer low-latency, energy-efficient, and highly accurate inference detection dedicated to these memory and energy-limited platforms."}, {"title": "2 Proposed Design", "content": "Our NN model is an 8-layer, one-dimensional, fully convolutional network that utilizes co-design pruning with 50% sparsity and hardware-aware quantization with 8-bit precision. Note that our ac-celerator also supports mixed precision models and two-dimensional convolutional operation.\nFigure 1 shows the architecture of our proposed CNN accelerator. The design features a four-dimensional architecture hierarchically organized into N core elements, W computing cores, H Sparse PEs (SPEs), and M PEs. Here, N, W, H, and M correspond to the input channel number, output feature map width, height, and output channel number, respectively. The accelerator computes a W\u00d7H\u00d7M block of output feature maps in parallel. We fabricate the accelerator with NxWxHxM as 2x4x4x16 and 12 PEs and 4 Mixed-PEs(MPEs) in 1 SPE, as shown in Figure 1, redundant computing units will be padded by zero during inference. In this 1d CNN demo, N is padded to 4 and only 1 computing core is used.\nFigure 2 presents the proposed area-power-efficient SPE architec-ture for sparse CNN acceleration. Each processing element selects input activations from 16 registers, using sparse weights and skip-ping zero values. The SPE has 12 PEs and 4 Mixed-PEs (MPEs)"}, {"title": "3 Measurement Results", "content": "The proposed CNN accelerator is fabricated using a TSMC 40nm LP CMOS process. Die photo and demo with UI are shown in Figure 4. Table 1 compares the results with previous works. For each IEGM recording, our accelerator achieves an inference time of 35 \u03bcs and a performance of 150 GOPS MAC operations, with an inference accuracy of 92.35%, diagnostic accuracy of 99.95%, precision of 99.88%, recall of 99.84%, average power consumption of 10.60 \u03bcW. Our design outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works by 14.23 times with 0.57 \u03bcW/mm\u00b2 power density. To accommodate other NN models, we fabricate the chip with 512 PEs and a large area (18.63 mm\u00b2), but only 128 PEs are engaged in this 1D CNN inference. For implantable or wearable medical applications, the chip size can be scaled down as needed. These results demonstrate that the accelerator is suitable for real-time VA detection in medical applications, offering low latency and power consumption at high accuracy."}]}

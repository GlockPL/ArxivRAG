Nonetheless, security and privacy concerns continue to pose as prominent challenges in this field. The emergence of blockchain technology, marked by its decentralized nature, tamper-proof attributes, distributed storage functionality, and traceability, has provided novel approaches for resolving these issues. Both of these technologies independently hold vast potential for development; yet, their combination uncovers substantial cross-disciplinary opportunities and growth prospects. The current research tendencies are increasingly concentrating on the integration of blockchain with large language models, with the aim of compensating for their respective limitations through this fusion and promoting further technological evolution. In this study, we evaluate the advantages and developmental constraints of the two technologies, and explore the possibility and development potential of their combination. This paper primarily investigates the technical convergence in two directions: Firstly, the application of large language models to blockchain, where we identify six major development directions and explore solutions to the shortcomings of blockchain technology and their application scenarios; Secondly, the application of blockchain technology to large language models, leveraging the characteristics of blockchain to remedy the deficiencies of large language models and exploring its application potential in multiple fields.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the wave of rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, LLMs multimodal large language models are becoming a key force driving innovation in the field, thanks to their strong language understanding and generation capabilities, as well as their increasing explainability. For instance, the study \u201cUtility of Multi-modal Large Language Models (GPT-4 Vision and Large Language and Vision Assistant) in Identifying Melanoma Across Different Skin Tones\u201d [1] demonstrates the application of these models in melanoma detection.Similarly, language models such as GPT-4 have been used to explain the functions of neurons in similar models [2]. Meanwhile, models such as GIT-Mol [3] and Gemini [4] have successfully integrated graph, image, and text information, showcasing their outstanding capabilities in cross-modal processing. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as image, audio, video, and text understanding.\nDespite their vast potential for applications, LLMs also face numerous challenges, particularly in data protection and privacy security. One particularly noteworthy issue is that LLMs are highly susceptible to manipulation, and may inadvertently reveal personal identity information (PII) in the process. For example, there have been cases where LLMs, under improper guidance, disclosed sensitive personal information, including full name, residence address, email, phone number, and related Twitter accounts to unauthorized users [5]. While LLMs can generate seemingly precise responses, they actually do not understand the language they are using, and may have absorbed incorrect information and biases during training, making it difficult to determine the authenticity of the content. As probabilistic algorithms, the reliability of their output is also questionable, and therefore, human oversight is needed to prevent the spread of incorrect information. Due to the lack of proper regulation and responsible use, the spread of incorrect information has become a prob-"}, {"title": null, "content": "lem [6]. Meanwhile, the widespread phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs highlights the disparity between the generated content and verifiable real-world facts, often manifesting as inconsistencies or fabrications [7]. These problems have not yet been fully resolved, and effective mitigation measures are relatively limited.\nIt is evident that to address the problems arising from large language models and prevent the emergence of more vulnerabilities, new technologies need to be introduced into the field. As a rapidly developing technology, blockchain's decentralized structure, distributed ledger, consensus algorithm, smart contracts, and asymmetric encryption ensure the security and transparency of the network, making it an innovative and reliable digital shared ledger that can record and store immutable data and transactions. It has shown disruptive potential in multiple industries such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management [8]. The characteristics of blockchain systems make it an ideal platform for enhancing the robustness of large language models. This integration provides the necessary framework, making it possible to incorporate more advanced privacy protection measures, enhanced logical reasoning verification, adversarial attack defense techniques, and similar safeguards into the design of large language models.\nThe blockchain is not yet a fully developed technology, and it still faces many problems, the most notable of which are computational attacks, network attacks, and smart contract security issues. Computational attacks, such as the 51% attack, allow attackers to manipulate transaction records by controlling most of the computing power, endangering the immutability of the blockchain. Network attacks, such as DoS attacks, impede normal communication between nodes and affect the stability of the blockchain network. Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts may result in financial losses and impaired contract functionality [9]. Meanwhile, blockchain also faces significant scalability challenges, as data storage becomes an increasingly important challenge as the blockchain network grows, especially in memory-constrained applications such as the Internet of Things. The original trilemma of scalability, decentralization, security, and trust has expanded into a four-fold"}, {"title": null, "content": "challenge, involving scalability, decentralization, security, and trust. Currently, blockchain systems are difficult to satisfy all four aspects simultaneously. For example, private and consortium chains may make progress in enhancing security and scalability, but this is often at the expense of decentralization; while blockchain based on DAG (directed acyclic graph) may perform well in enhancing scalability and decentralization, but may have insufficient security and trust-building capabilities [10].\nHowever, this challenge also provides opportunities for the integration of blockchain technology with large language models. By combining the immutability and distributed ledger characteristics of blockchain with the intelligent processing capabilities of large language models, we can open up new solutions to alleviate or even solve these challenges. In recent years' technological development trends, the integration of blockchain technology with large language model fields has become a focus of research. As an emerging field, blockchain services for large language models is still in its early stages and requires in-depth analysis and research. Our goal is to help researchers have a more comprehensive understanding of the development trends of these two fields, especially to explore how to efficiently integrate blockchain technology into large language model systems and how large language models can help improve blockchain technology. Through this review, this review aims to provide insights to researchers to overcome the challenges that may arise in the process of technological integration and promote further development and application of technological integration."}, {"title": "II.

Due to the decentralization and anonymity of blockchain, the following problems can be solved by introducing it into large language models.\n1) Privacy-preserving data sharing and training using blockchain: The common federated learning architecture is client-server. The server transmits intermediate parameter models such as gradients, model parameters, and embedded representations during the training process to the client locally. After the client updates the model locally, it sends the parameter model back to the central server. The central server After receiving the parameters from all parties, the calculation is aggregated, and the updated model parameters are issued again. This process loops until the model converges or the training is terminated. Another common architecture is the end-to-end network architecture. This architecture consists of terminals holding data, with no central server. A terminal holding training data then performs data training and passes the model parameters to the next terminal until the model converges or the training is terminated. In this process, the blockchain can manage the communication between devices and the update of model parameters, so that the data is always saved locally, ensuring data security to a certain extent.\n2) Safe and reliable personal data protection and sharing: The training data of large language models may contain sensitive personal training information or private data, and unprocessed data may lead to privacy leaks. Academic research shows the risk that models may inadvertently generate text containing personal information is real. In addition, personal data is mainly stored in the cloud. However, there are certain risks in using third-party cloud storage services. Additionally, users lack ownership of their data as they may belong to third-party service providers once registered, and users have no right to know and control private data.

Decentralized model training", "content": "Different devices in our daily lives generate and collect a lot of data, but it is difficult for a central server to collect and process all this data. With the diversification of device functions, the emergence and development of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT) have made the generation and circulation of data more rapid and extensive, which provides more development space for distributed large language model training. Among them, federated learning is developing rapidly. However, traditional federated learning frameworks face a huge risk of Single Point Of Failure (SPOF) due to their heavy reliance on central servers. This means that if the central server fails or is attacked, the entire learning process may be interrupted, affecting the stability and reliability of model training.

As a result, researchers are exploring how to design more robust federated learning architectures and develop effective incentives to encourage wider device participation and improve overall learning efficiency.\n1) Decentralized federated learning system : Decentralized Federated Learning systems address the single point of failure problem in traditional federated learning through peer-to-peer communication, but they face challenges such as malicious clients, low-quality models, and the lack of incentive mechanisms. The Chain FL system utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and the authority proof consensus mechanism to improve response speed, and implements large-scale federated learning through smart contracts. [11] Kim proposed a method that stores the global model on the blockchain and ensures the secure sharing of model updates. Ramanan et al. further used a private Ethereum network to aggregate device updates [12] .The Fedstellar platform supports various federated learning configurations [13], and VDFChain provides a secure and verifiable decentralized federated learning solution based on a committee-based blockchain [14]. In addition, some research has proposed a completely decentralized federated learning method, which shares knowledge through the teacher-student role allocation of the model without transmitting original data or parameters. Another study proposed a general DFL framework that balances communication and computational costs through multi-round local updates and inter-node communications, and introduces compressed communication to improve efficiency. The ProxyFL scheme improves communication efficiency and privacy protection by maintaining private and proxy models [15]. These studies demonstrate the potential of DFL in enhancing the robustness and privacy of machine learning model training.\n2) Incentive mechanism design in decentralized training: Incentive mechanisms are crucial in federated learning, as they compensate participating clients for the costs of their computational and data contributions, ensuring data diversity and the generalization ability of the model.

An innovative two-stage Stackelberg game method is proposed to optimize resource allocation strategies and ensure that clients can make reasonable decisions on computational capability allocation in the case of incomplete information [17]. In addition, a new federated learning incentive mechanism, FDFL, is introduced. This mechanism provides a more comprehensive contribution evaluation and reward allocation scheme by considering the differences in data category distribution and the honesty of the server. Through security analysis and experimental verification, FDFL demonstrates excellent performance in terms of model accuracy and robustness while ensuring the truthfulness of the incentive mechanism and individual rationality [18].

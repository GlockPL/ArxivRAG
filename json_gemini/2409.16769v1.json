Our primary contribution is the establishment of a theoretical framework where we demonstrate that the optimization landscape, under the influence of our algorithm, exhibits unique stability characteristics defined by Lyapunov stability principles. Specifically, we prove that the superlevel sets of the loss function, as influenced by our adaptive learning rate, are always connected, ensuring consistent training dynamics. Furthermore, we establish the \"equiconnectedness\" property of these superlevel sets, which maintains uniform stability across varying training conditions and epochs. This paper contributes to the theoretical understanding of dynamic learning rate mechanisms in neural networks and also pave the way for the development of more efficient and reliable neural optimization techniques. This study intends to formalize and validate the equiconnectedness of loss function as superlevel sets in the context of neural network training, opening newer avenues for future research in adaptive machine learning algorithms.

Introduction", "content": "There has been significant progress towards the development and deployment of neural network models. The deployment of a neural network model demands, high accuracy and precision, and hyperparameter optimization plays an important role towards building such a model. The researchers' community has been actively analyzing learning rates, and loss functions, to make the network more stable across datasets, and prevent overfiting (Park, Yi, & Ji, 2020)(Cutkosky, Defazio, & Mehta, 2024)(Kornblith, Chen, Lee, & Norouzi, 2021)."}, {"title": "2. Mathematical Underpinnings", "content": "The superlevel sets $S_x = {x \\in R^n : L(x) > \\lambda}$ reveal important stability and convergence properties for gradient-based optimization methods (Jin, Ge, Netrapalli, Kakade, & Jordan, 2017). An exponentially decaying learning rate, defined by $\\eta(t) = \\eta_0 e^{-\\alpha t}$, where $\\eta_0$ is the initial rate and $\\alpha$ a positive decay constant, is beneficial. It allows for quick initial progress by using a higher initial rate, guiding the optimizer towards important areas quickly (Goyal, Doll\u00e1r, Girshick, Noordhuis, Wesolowski, Kyrola, Tulloch, Jia, & He, 2017). As training proceeds, this rate gradually decreases, allowing for more precise adjustments and preventing common issues like overshooting minima (Ge, Lee, & Ma, 2015). This dynamic rate adjustment, when coupled with the structure of superlevel sets, offers insights into the training's stability by ensuring the optimization path remains connected and stable through the topology of the landscape (Li et al., 2018). By adopting a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ that decreases along these paths, we enforce stability and keep the system's energy diminishing, keeping the optimization within stable parameter regions (Chen et al., 2020). Together, these elements create a robust framework that deepens our understanding of the dynamics in neural network training and highlights the significance of careful tuning of hyperparameters in managing complex optimization scenarios (Neyshabur et al., 2017).\nTo understand the concept better, consider a ball that rolls down a hilly terrain towards a valley, representing the minimum of a loss landscape. Initially, the ball is given a strong push (high initial learning rate $\\eta_0$) allowing it to quickly descend from higher elevations (higher loss values in superlevel sets $S_x$). Each superlevel set corresponds to a range of elevations where the ball's potential energy (analogous to the loss value in the neural network) remains above a certain threshold $\\Lambda$. As the ball descends from higher altitudes to lower ones, it transitions from one superlevel set to another, each with decreasing minimum energy thresholds. As it approaches the valley, the slope (gradient) lessens and so does the ball's speed due to the exponential decay of the push force ($\\eta(t) = \\eta_0 e^{-\\alpha t}$), preventing it from overshooting the valley. This gradual slowing is critical as it ensures that the ball can finely adjust its path to settle in the deepest part of the valley, analogous to achieving the most optimal parameters in a neural network training scenario. This model demonstrates how the dynamic learning rate and the structure of the superlevel sets interact, ensuring that the optimization path remains stable and connected throughout the descent, analogous to how the ball consistently follows a path that leads it towards the valley without getting stuck or veering off course."}, {"title": "3. Fundamental Concepts", "content": "The parameter vector $\\theta$, has the network's weights and biases, and is an integral part for the network's learning, as it is meticulously adjusted to minimize divergences between predicted outputs and actual targets (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015).

In classification tasks, this relationship is mathematically expressed through the softmax function:\n\n$P(Y = c | X;\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp (f_c(X;\\theta))}{\\Sigma_{j=1}^C \\exp (f_j(X; \\theta))}$ ,\n\nwhere $f_c(X; \\theta)$ represents the network output for class c, and C denotes the total number of classes (Bishop, 2006). This formulation is essential in demonstrating how our model probabilistically classifies input data into defined output classes.\nBuilding on this framework, we derive a likelihood function reflecting the probability of observing our training dataset $D = \\{(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^m$ under the model parameters $\\theta$ :\n\n$L(\\theta; D) = \\Pi_{i=1}^m P(y^{(i)} | x^{(i)}; \\theta)$.\n\nThis likelihood function for quantifying how well the model aligns with empirical data, setting the stage for parameter optimization via Bayesian inference (Graves, 2011). Incorporating Bayesian principles, we consider the posterior probability of the parameters $\\theta$ given the data D, calculated as follows:\n\n$P(\\theta | D) \\propto L(\\theta;D)P(\\theta)$,\n\nwhere $P(\\theta)$ denotes the prior distribution over the parameters (Blundell, Cornebise, Kavukcuoglu, & Wierstra, 2015). This Bayesian framework facilitates a comprehensive parameter optimization strategy, harmonizing empirical data adaptation with existing parameter knowledge.\nThe culmination of this probabilistic modeling leads to the optimization phase within a gradient descent framework, where our methodology involves iteratively minimizing the negative log-posterior:\n\n$- \\log P(\\theta | D) = - \\log L(\\theta; D) - \\log P(\\theta) + const.$\n\nHere, the gradient descent update rule is critical:\n\n$\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha(t)\\nabla_{\\theta} [- \\log P (\\theta_t | D)]$,\n\nwhere $\\alpha(t)$ is the learning rate, dynamically adapting to ensure efficient convergence and stability of the model (Kingma & Ba, 2015)."}, {"title": "3.2 Exponentially Decaying Learning Rate", "content": "The formulation of the Exponentially Decaying Learning Rate (derivation in the supplementary) given by\n$\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt} = -\\alpha_0 \\beta e^{-\\beta t}$,\ninfluences the topology of the loss function's superlevel sets $S_x = {\\theta \\in R^n : L(\\theta) > \\lambda}$. The dynamically adjusted learning rate ensures that these sets remain connected, supporting a stable and cohesive optimization trajectory (Goyal et al., 2017). Within the gradient descent framework, this leads to an adapted parameter update rule\n$\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t - \\alpha_0 e^{-\\beta t} \\nabla_{\\theta} [- \\log P (\\theta_t | D)]$,\neffectively illustrating the integration of an exponential decay learning rate within the gradient descent mechanism (Kingma & Ba, 2015). This methodical approach not only enhances the theoretical underpinnings of our optimization strategy but also significantly boosts its practical efficacy. By marrying the theoretical concepts of exponential decay with gradient descent, our approach fosters training dynamics that effectively navigate the complex, high-dimensional spaces typical of deep learning tasks (Li et al., 2018). This novel integration offers a rigorous, theoretically informed enhancement to the conventional training paradigms, ensuring that both the stability and the efficiency of the learning process are maximized (Du et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Dynamic Cost Function", "content": "In our study, we refined our dynamic cost function to adeptly integrate principles from statistical learning theory, with an emphasis on addressing class imbalances and evolving training requirements.

We have studied the properties of superlevel sets, which are crucial in understanding the dynamic adjustments of our gradient-based learning methods. These sets maintain a stable and efficient learning path, enhanced by adaptive learning rates modulated through a Lyapunov function V(x), which aligns the gradient flow to ensure consistency across training iterations (Dauphin et al., 2014). By ensuring that V(x) decreases along the trajectory of the learning process\u2014reflecting a decline in the system's energy-the gradient updates are systematically adjusted to prevent oscillations and divergences, thus resulting in smoother convergence(Zhang & Others, 2019).\nGoing further, we define a superlevel set's connectivity by the existence of a continuous path $\\gamma : [0,1] \\rightarrow S_x$ connecting any two points x, y within the set, ensuring comprehensive exploration of the parameter space.

Stability and Convergence Analysis with Lyapunov Stability Theory", "content": "In neural network optimization, employing the loss function L(\u03b8) as a Lyapunov function enriches the stability and convergence analysis, leveraging its properties like positive definiteness and radial unboundedness to gauge network performance and systemic stability. This setup allows for monitoring stability through the non-increasing nature of the loss function over time, indicated by $\\frac{dV}{dt} \\leq 0$, suggesting that perturbations in parameter values do not escalate loss values, thereby aiding convergence towards equilibrium, typically a local minimum. The introduction of level sets $L_x$ and super level sets $S_x$ deepens the understanding of the optimization landscape, mapping areas where the loss function meets or surpasses specific thresholds and examining how updates navigate these regions. The differential inequality analysis further underscores this, showing consistent loss minimization and the benefits of an exponentially decaying learning rate, $\\alpha(t) = \\omega e^{-\\beta t}$, which manages the magnitude of parameter updates to prevent overshooting and enhance stability (Goyal et al., 2017).

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The industrial metaverse (IMV) [1], [2] is rapidly emerging as a paradigm-shifting technology that integrates the physical and digital worlds. Central to this paradigm are digital twins (DTs) [3]\u2013[5], virtual representations of real-world assets or processes. DTs offer invaluable insights into asset performance, enabling predictive maintenance, optimization, and innovation.\nBlockchain technology (BCT) [6], with its decentralized and immutable nature, has found numerous applications in the IMV [4]. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) [7] are a particular subset of blockchain assets that represent unique digital items [8]. In the context of DTs, NFTs can be used to create and own cloneable DTs like the NFT avatars in social metaverse [9], allowing for multiple virtual instances of a physical asset. This enables simultaneous testing and interaction across various virtual environments, accelerating development and experimentation.\nHowever, the decentralized nature of NFTs also presents challenges due to possible security threats associated with BCT [6]. The potential for unauthorized duplication, or counterfeiting, of NFT is a growing concern [9]. Existing methods for detecting fake clones often rely on static information like metadata, which can be easily manipulated. To address these limitations and ensure the integrity of NFT-DTs in the IMV, robust and reliable security measures are essential. This research focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution to identify counterfeit NFT digital twins. Inspired by behavioural biometrics [10], [11], by analyzing the distinctive behavioural patterns of DTs, we aim to enhance the security and authenticity of these valuable digital assets in the industrial metaverse.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews existing literature on the industrial metaverse and its components. In Section III, we describe the architecture and operation of our proposed hybrid NFT-DT classification model. Subsequently, Section IV outlines the experimental setup designed to simulate IMV scenarios for DTs of heaters. Section V discusses potential security threats associated with DTs in the metaverse. Finally, the results of our experiments are presented in Section VI, leading to our conclusions and future research directions in Section VII."}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Industrial Metaverse", "content": "The metaverse [12] is a complex and immersive environment that integrates several key components to create a fully interactive experience across various domains including healthcare [13], [14], education [15], [16], power managements [17]. It is often categorized in the social [18], [19] and industrial [1], [3], [20] scenario. In [21], authors presented the healthcare metaverse and its three essential components including Extended Reality (XR), Blockchain Technology (BCT), and user avatars. The work describes that three more dimensions add to these components due to the their combinations. However, these all components are essential only for a highly immersive metaverse scenarios like a critical medical application. Hence, the components proposed in [21] can be applicable in a generalized form of the metaverse, which can be used completely or partially based on the complexity and immersiveness of application scenario."}, {"title": "B. NFTs in Metaverse", "content": "NFTs are the digital assets traceable on the blockchains. Every NFT holds a unique value which makes it different from the crypto currency that are fungible tokens. In [8], authors explored the transformative impact of NFTs on artists and the art market. Here authors highlighted the role of blockchain technology in enabling artists, game developers, and content creators to tokenize their work to reach a global audience and retain ownership. Although the work envisioned a future where NFTs play a crucial role in personalized digital interactions, yet, this work did not provide any insights into the application of NFTs in the metaverse. In another work by Jing et al. [7], the relationship between rarity and the aesthetic experience of 3D profile picture NFTs was studied in the metaverse scenario. The study primarily suggests that 3D profile picture NFTs play a significant role in the metaverse by serving as \"digital avatars\" helping users to project themselves in an immersive virtual world. As avatar customization is possible in immersive environments, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics for creating valuable and engaging NFT experiences. Musamih et al. [23] also presented a vision for NFTs, particularly in the healthcare domain, emphasizing their potential applications in patient data management, supply chain transparency, and clinical trial integrity. They highlighted the importance of patient empowerment through NFT ownership and the need for secure digital twins to represent patients and their data. Notably, here authors have considered tokenizing the medical assets through NFTs to produce the DTs. Another DT-based strategy was proposed in [24] to preserve and sustain Miao silver craftsmanship in the metaverse era using NFTs. This paper highlights the potential of using NFT DTs in fields like fashion, art, and cultural events. The work claimed that DTs of artifacts can provide verifiable information about their origin, history, and ownership by leveraging the principles of BCT.\nThe fake avatar cloning in metaverse can lead to various security risks. We also came across a privacy awareness frame- work for NFT avatars in the metaverse where avatars were represented as NFTs [9]. This work focused on recognizing the cloned NFT-avatars based on some similarity score. Such cyber threat may also hold in IMV, however, we could not find any work done towards the security of DTs in IMV."}, {"title": "C. Behavioural Pattern in Metaverse", "content": "Different combinations of body motion features can be analyzed to get the behavioural patterns [10]. The behavioural patterns, which are unique to each individual, are known as 'behavioural biometric' and can be used for individual identification. In [11], authors explore the use of clustering techniques to analyze avatar behaviours in virtual worlds. By extracting data on avatar movements, interactions, and chat logs, the researchers aim to automatically classify avatars into different groups based on their observed behaviours. In some other works in this domain, behavioural patterns are used to identify individuals [25]. However, it has been found that these are not limited to human behaviour as devices [26], software [27], [28] and industrial control systems [29] can also be identified by the behavioural patterns using various approaches including ML. These works suggest the fake components or devices can be identified by observing anomalous or fraudulent behaviours.\nIn a recent work by Zelenyanszki et al. [9], they pro- posed a privacy awareness framework for NFT avatars in the metaverse. This work primarily focused on integrating avatars as NFTs and detecting cloned avatars by evaluating their similarity using a scoring system. They have also discussed the possibility of using machine learning algorithms to identify potential privacy threats and enhancing user awareness through behavioural tracking. However, the work lacks discussion on the essential behavioural patterns in details and validating it through any experiment. Taking into account these diverse scenarios and insights gained from work in the metaverse, we chose to jointly leverage blockchain technology (BCT) and machine learning to secure NFT digital twins within the IMV ecosystem."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "IMV consists of the devices and other physical entities in industrial applications. The three core components of an ideal industrial metaverse are BCT, DT and NFT, as shown in Fig. 1. In this paper, we propose the development of a secure metaverse system for digital twins by introducing NFT digital twins (NFT-DTs) and AI-driven smart contracts. These smart contracts dynamically verify the originality of a digital twin based on its behavioural patterns. The complete DT behavioural pattern recognition is split into two parts - a) pattern encoding, b) classification, both addressed using deep learning models (Fig. 2). For hyperparameter optimization of these models, we employed the Python library keras-tuner."}, {"title": "A. Pattern Encoding", "content": "Autoencoders are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to compress and reconstruct input data. These models consist of an encoder component that compresses the input into a latent representation as Pe and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from this latent representation or encoding.\nThe sample of a raw behavioural pattern of a DT contains the t readings of k features. Hence, the behavioural pattern is a 2-dimensional (2-D) array of size (t \u00d7 k). Hence, a denoising autoencoder (DAE) was designed to encode the 2-D patterns to a 1-D array of k' elements. Conversely, the decoder aims to reconstruct the original behavioural pattern from the encoded representation Pe. The weights of the autoencoder are optimized in order to minimize the reconstruction loss of the complete system. The proposed solution utilizes an encoder to update the metadata of the NFT-DT with the most recent encoded patterns and enables real-time pattern recognition of the digital twin when integrated with a classifier.\nThe encoder of the proposed DAE initially transforms the 2-D time series pattern as a 1-D array of t\u00b7k elements. The transformed array is then subjected to a hierarchical encoding process using five hidden layers, progressively compressing the information into a 1-D array of k' element vectors. Here, each of the hidden layers includes a normalization layer followed by a dropout, which drops the noise from the input patterns. The complete encoder model was dveloped for t = 34, k = 5, and k\u2032 = 62."}, {"title": "B. Behavioural Pattern Classification", "content": "Coming from the family of deep learning, RNN models can robustly handle complex sequential data [30], [31]. Equation 1 and Equation 2 provide the calculation for a hidden state h_t and output y_t at time t. Here, x and y represent the input and output values, W denotes the weight matrix, and b denotes the bias matrix. However, the traditional RNN models suffer from the vanishing gradient problem [32]. Therefore, these models fail to retain the essential temporal information to learn from the long-term dependencies.\n$h_t = tanh(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xy}x_t + b_h)$ (1)\n$y_t = tanh(W_{hy}h_t + b_h)$ (2)\nTo overcome this problem, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), another type of RNN, can be used that is specialized to learn from the long-term dependencies [33], [34]. GRU aim to update the hidden states with some additional values through the reset gates r_t and update gate z_t, at the time t, as per the Eqn. 3, Eqn. 4, and Eqn. 4, respectively. Additionally, the order sequence also matters in time-series data and can be used to generate or identify the past or future sequences. Therefore learning from both past and future insights of a time-series input can lead to a more robust model. An advanced version of GRU, bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU), is capable of learning such insights by processing the input in both orders (Fig. 3). Hence, we developed a pattern classification model based on the Bi-GRU.\n$r_t = \\sigma(W_{xr}x_t + W_{hr}h_{t-1}+b_r)$ (3)\n$z_t = \\sigma(W_{xz}x_t + W_{hz}h_{t-1}+b_z)$ (4)\n$h_t = (1 - z_t) \\circ h_{t-1}+ z_t \\circ tanh(W_{xh}x_t+r_t \\odot W_{hh}h_{t-1}+b_h)$ (5)\nAlthough, the encoded patterns Pe do not explicitly have any separation of each time-stamp, however, this information is efficiently compressed in the encoding. Hence, the proposed classification model works with the encoded data patterns provided by the encoder component of DAE, discussed in Section III-A. The final classification results are later processed to identify the in-class and OOC behavioural patterns. The working model of the proposed classification system is shown in Fig. 4.\nWe developed a multi-class classification model for DT be- havioural pattern classification using Bi-GRU. This approach enhances the DT behavioural pattern classification in the following ways:\n1) The original behavioural pattern is protected as only encoded information is supplied to the classifier, which may be publicly accessible as an open DT detection solution.\n2) Real-time and faster classification due to the smaller size of the input."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "content": "The testbed was built using a local Ethereum test network utilizing Ganache as the experimental environment. For better usage, a command-line interface (CLI) application, developed with Hardhat and JavaScript, facilitated interaction with the test network nodes. We also created separate scripts, written using ether.js library, to query, compare, and engage with NFT- DTs accessible on the network. The Solidity programming language was used to construct smart contracts, leveraging the OpenZeppelin Contracts library and ERC721 interface. The static metadata for these NFT-DTs was hosted on a separate GitHub repository. This testbed helped to mint the NFT-DTS and create their clones and supports the DT creation in the following ways:\n1) Minting with uniform resource identifier (URI) of meta- data (genuine way of fresh DT creation);\n2) Cloning using URI;\n3) Cloning using token ID of DT, provided by smart contract;\n4) Cloning using metadata populated randomly."}, {"title": "A. Experimental Set-up for DT Behavioural Pattern Recogni- tion", "content": "We consider the scenario of the industrial metaverse where the digital twin of heaters is to be used as NFT-DTS. As discussed in Section III, the proposed method of NFT comparison (Fig. 2), based on real-time behavioural patterns, is implemented.\n1) Dataset: We used a public dataset from Kaggle related to the health of the digital twins of gadgets [35]. It consists of the readings collected for heaters of the following elements over a continuous interval of time:\n1) Voltage measured: The voltage supplied\n2) Current measured: The current supplied\n3) Temperature measured: The temperature measured\n4) Current charge: The current flow recorded while charg- ing\n5) Voltage charge: The voltage level while charging\n6) Capacity: The energy storage capacity\nAfter the pre-processing, the Voltage measured and Voltage charge were found to be identical. Hence, Voltage charge was excluded from further usage. In various cycles, the data is recorded for N = 4 heaters. Here, the samples collected during each cycle of the experiment also varied. We considered the 132 cycles of experiments where the duration for each cycle ranged from 26 minutes to 60 minutes. The complete information is provided in the Table I. The proposed classifi- cation model is meant to be accessible to each of the nodes in the blockchain network of the metaverse. This enables all nodes to individually verify the originality of an NFT-DT by passing the latest behaviour patterns."}, {"title": "V. SECURITY ANALYSIS", "content": "Various attacks related to the enabling technologies of the metaverse have also been discovered which can affect the metaverse in terms of data loss, unauthorized access, and denial of services (DoS), to name a few [21]. In this section, we have analyzed multiple security aspects related to DTs in the metaverse, the limitations of existing solutions, and the proposed approach for overcoming the problems."}, {"title": "A. Issues with DT Cloning", "content": "The principles of BCT can be largely helpful in addressing the problems related to information traceability and verifiability of DTs using NFT-DTs. However, blockchain has also been found to be vulnerable to several attacks. The vulnerabilities associated with smart contracts, and targeted market risks can also affect the NFTs [6], and hence NFT-DTs. Apart from these possible dimensions of risks associated with the NFT-DTs, the possibility of DT cloning can also lead to severe problems. However, genuine DT cloning can be helpful in many ways [36], but it may also lead to the fake cloning of NFT-DTs.\nTable II lists some common differences between a genuine and fake clone of DTs in socio-industrial metaverse scenarios. The clones of DTs can enable user presence in multiple virtual environments and can be used for testing purposes, yet a fake clone can still lead to information leakage and account takeover. Authors of [9] have addressed this issue mostly in the case of the social metaverse by leveraging the comparison of metadata and the appearance of two avatars in a metaverse environment. They have also conceptualized the behavioural comparisons of human avatars, however, their main work highlights how static metadata and image distance comparison can be utilized to detect cloned NFTs."}, {"title": "B. Limitations of existing DT clone detection method", "content": "Existing NFT clone detection methods utilize the compari- son of static information to find the similarity between original and target NFTs [9]. This is why, the duplication of static information like metadata, URL of additional data locations and other information associated with NFT can lead to the highly similar fake clones of NFT. Our experiments prove that there is a high chance of creating a fake NFT clone, making it difficult to detect the fraudulent cloning of NFT-DTs. The details of this experiment are provided in Section VI."}, {"title": "C. Securing the Behavioural Patterns", "content": "Due to the uniqueness of patterns [26]\u2013[29], we decided to utilize the behavioural patterns of DTs for originality verification. However, as the pattern itself is sensitive information, we ensured to protect the same by encoding them using DAE. Automating the process of pattern encoding through smart contracts and only considering the encoded patterns throughout the verification process would lead to a more secure metaverse application.\nIn the context of a multi-class classifier, completeness is the measurement of not identifying an input as a class which does not exist. Therefore, a complete solution is resistant to targeted attacks like identity spoofing. We tested 132 behavioural patterns for each of the 4 different NFT-DTs and computed the completeness scores for each DT. The final results are provided in Table III."}, {"title": "D. Dynamic metadata for NFT-DTs", "content": "Each NFT is associated with a JSON metadata file containing additional information. The attributes field within this metadata stores various properties related to the NFT's interactive and non-interactive characteristics. To strengthen DT security through real-time verification, we propose a new approach: dividing the attributes field into two distinct fields: readOnly_attributes and writable_attributes. This dynamic metadata concept allows for more robust security measures. During the minting process, an encoder model (ei) is also deployed, where i denotes the ID of the current NFT-DT. The address of ei is stored along with the node information. The smart contract is configured to update the readOnly_attributes of metadata over a fixed interval of time as per the Algorithm 1. The smart contract allows a user to verify the originality of any NFT-DT by passing a behavioural pattern from cached data as \u03b2. Algorithm 2 is triggered during the verification process of DT i, which can detect a genuine or fake clone of any NFT-DT in the network of IMV."}, {"title": "Algorithm 1 Dynamic Metadata Update for NFT-DTS", "content": "Require: \u03b2: Live pattern of NFT-DT i\nRequire: ei: Encoder model associated with NFT-DT i\nRequire: readOnly_attributes\n1: Compress Live Pattern:\n2: \u03b2\u0384 \u2190 ei(\u03b2) \u25b7 Compress live pattern using encoder\n3: Update Read-Only Attributes:\n4: Update readOnly_attributes with B\nIn the current scenario, we assume that the classifier (Ca) is pre-trained and already deployed.

We have tested the performance of our clone detection model separately, which can be integrated with the metaverse for AI-driven smart contracts.\nAs mentioned in Table II, the fake DT cloning can be done by copying the complete metadata and hosting it to a separate"}, {"title": "Algorithm 2 NFT-DT Verification", "content": "Require: B: Cached behavioural pattern of NFT-DT i\nRequire: ei: Encryption model associated with NFT-DT i\nRequire: B: Latest behavioural pattern of NFT-DT i\nRequire: Ca: Shared DT classification model\n1: Compress Cached Pattern:\n2: \u03b2\u0384 \u2190 ei(\u03b2)\n3: Load Latest Pattern from Metadata:\n4: Load B from metadata\n5: Perform Predictions:\n6: Pa \u2190 Ca(\u03b2)\n7: Pc \u2190 Ca(\u03b2)\n8: Verify Originality:\n9: if Pa == Pc then\n10: Declare Fake Clone:\n11: Print \"Verification Failed (fake clone)\"\n12: else if N is odd then\n13: Print \"Verification Successful (genuine clone)\"\n14: end if\nlocation (URI). The different URI enables the attacker to own the fake clone of NFT-DT and have complete control over it. With a static metadata, the comparison will always results into a genuine clone. However, due to the proposed concept of dynamic metadata through Al-driven smart contracts, this NFT-DT cloning attack can be mitigated. We can represent the dynamic metadata \\(\\Delta M\\) of an original DT as \\(\\Delta M_{a_i}\\), genuine clone of DT as \\(\\Delta M_g\\), and fake clone DT as \\(\\Delta M_f\\). Considering that \\(M_{a_i}^{gt}\\) representes the metadata of an original NFT-DT \\(a_i\\), at time t, Eq. 6 shows the metadata of 2 clones created at the same time t.\n$\\Delta M_{a_i} = M_{a_i}^{gt} - M_{Ot}$\n$\\Delta M_g = M_{Ot}^{gt} - M_{Ot}$ (6)\n$\\Delta M_f = M_{Ot}^{ft} - M_{Ot}$\nIt can be noticed that both genuine (\\(\\Delta M_{a_i}^{gt}\\)) and fake (\\(\\Delta M_{O_t}^{ft}\\)) clones of an NFT-DT \\(a_i\\) at time t are identical. The metadata updates are triggered by the temper-proof smart contract, which are meant to be separate for each NFT. In the given scenario, \\(M_{a_i}^{gt}\\) is mapped to retrieve the data from already existing DT \\(a_i\\). However, for the fake NFT, attacker would try to map a new NFT-DT by mirroring the metadata. Hence, at a later time t', the two metadata will have signifient difference, that can be expressed through Eqn. 7. The change occurs due to the difference in behavioural pattern of genuine and fake clones at time t'. Additionally, the manual tempering of \\(\\Delta M_{O_t}^{ft'}\\) is not possible during verification, due to the involvement of smart contract. Hence, the proposed \\(\\Delta M\\) for NFT-DTs strengthens the security and makes the the system resilient to the fake cloning using metadata.\n$\\Delta M_{a_i}^{gt'} = \\Delta M_{a_i}$ (7)\n$\\Delta M_{O_t}^{ft'} \\neq \\Delta M_{O_t}$"}, {"title": "VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "As provided in Table I, the 34 continuous data rows are considered as one sample. Each of the samples has nearly 10 minutes duration. We proposed a hybrid classification system that utilizes an autoencoder and a GRU-based deep learning model. The proposed denoising auto-encoder takes an input matrix of size 34 \u00d7 5 and encodes it into an array of 62 elements. The encoded data is passed through the classifier which is ultimately responsible for the identification of the correct digital twin based on the behavioural pattern of the device.\nUsing the testbed explained in Section IV, we initially created 9 original NFT-DTs, followed by creating 25 clones based on the various methods. Table IV presents the similarity score of some NFT-DT clones along with the corresponding target token IDs of NFTs. It was found that the similarity scores of cloned NFT-DTs ranged from 8.33% to 100%. It indicated that there is a high chance of creating a fake NFT clone with the least similarity score. Hence, we provide a de- tailed performance of the proposed autoencoder for real-time behavioural pattern encoding and the proposed pattern-based NFT-DT classification system. A confidence-based threshold rule is also discussed which can help to identify the fake clones of a genuine DT.\nThe proposed DAE compresses the raw behavioural patterns as an encoding of size 62. The hyperparameter tuning was done using the keras-tuner module in Python. The summary of model performance is provided in Table V.\nThe data was collected from 34 continuous rows of behavioural patterns which can be considered for temporal feature analysis, where the order has significant importance. It is clear from the performance that it precisely compresses the sequential and temporal information within 62 character. Hence, we developed a bi-directional GRU-based data classification method that works with the encoded data only. The performance of the proposed classifier is given in Table VI.\nAmong 528 test samples, the proposed model could not identify the 9 samples. An in-depth analysis indicated that out of the 9 misclassification, 8 samples belonged to a DT with PhID 3 and 1 belonged to PhID 1. Additionally, these are misclassified to DT with PhID 1 and 3 respectively. However, among 132 samples for each digital twin, a maximum 8 misclassification brings the worst-case accuracy of an individual (soundness) DT to 93.94% which might be considered satisfactory. The graph corresponding to the soundness and completeness of the solution is provided as Fig. 6.\nHowever, one major problem with such a multiclass classification model is that it can not accurately identify the pattern from an OOC/unseen DT. Hence, the model currently identifies the OOC DT as one of the N known classes. To address the challenge of identifying OOC behaviours, we propose a novel approach based on prediction confidence. By analyzing the confidence levels associated with true and false predictions, we observed a clear discrepancy. Specifically, true predictions relatively exhibited higher confidence scores compared to false ones. Therefore, we introduced a threshold parameter, \\(\\tau\\), to effectively detect OOC DT instances. As per the rule, if the prediction confidence falls below \\(\\tau\\), it is considered to be the behaviour of an OOC DT. Fig. 7 shows the results of our experiments to optimize the value of \\(\\tau\\), balancing the trade-off between true and false predictions. Through the analysis of true and misclassified samples, we determined the optimal threshold value to be \\(\\tau\\) = 69.50%.\nThe final results obtained after setting the \\(\\tau\\) are provided in Table VII. Here false positive (FP) represents the misclassified samples with a confidence higher than \\(\\tau\\) and false negative (FN) represents the count of correct classifications, which are rejected due to confidence lower than \\(\\tau\\)."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE", "content": "This paper explored the combined role of NFT digital twins (DTs) and deep learning in shaping a more secure industrial metaverse. The NFT-DTs can enhance security using the BCT principles and ease of interaction through cloning. However, NFT-DT cloning can lead to security risks of counterfeit products and twin identity spoofing. We analyzed the data privacy and security associated with digital twins (DTs) and the performance of the existing NFT clone detection methods, in the context of the industrial metaverse. We then proposed a novel approach for clone originality verification through a hybrid deep-learning framework based on DAE and Bi-GRU, and mitigating the risk of fake cloning through dynamic metadata (\\(\\Delta M\\)). The solution is developed for real-time behavioural pattern recognition and can be utilized to create AI-driven smart contracts. We also proposed the concept of dynamic metadata for NFT avatars making it difficult for attackers to clone the avatars using metadata.\nDespite this paper introducing the feasibility of NFT-DTs for the secured industrial metaverse, the performance of DT clone detection with the behavioural classification of NFT- DTs can further be improved with sufficient OOC data to get more realistic results. Additionally, the multiclass clas- sifications model can be difficult to deploy into an actual industrial metaverse due to the higher dependency on the behavioural data from all DTs. Hence, developing suitable one-class classifiers or federated learning-based approaches should also be explored to determine the feasibility of the proposed solution in a wider scenario."}]}

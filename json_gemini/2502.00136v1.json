Chang, Stanford University"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a three-branch checks- and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by governmental systems. It implements three in- dependent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, DIKE as the legislative branch establishing ethi- cal guardrails, and ERIS as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. The adversarial DIKE- ERIS duality enables adaptation to diverse cul- tural contexts while upholding consistent ethical principles. This architecture addresses limitations of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) by providing interpretable, adaptable, and culturally-aware ethical reasoning. Through self-supervised learning and adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how emotional mod- eling can guide linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence across knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and con- textual interpretation.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "This research presents an alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (OpenAI, 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022) to address ethical concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF has shown success, it faces two key challenges: susceptibility to social biases in polarized feedback and vulnerability to reward hacking (Christiano et al., 2023; Skalse et al., 2022), which can lead to unethical behavior.\n\nA key limitation of current RLHF-based approaches is their narrow focus on isolated behaviors rather than holistic pat- terns. This reactive strategy resembles \u201cWhack-A-Mole,\" where individual issues are suppressed without addressing underlying causes. For example, regularly instructing some- one to make bed does not inherently improve tidiness as they may not extend the habit to tasks such as washing laundry and dishes. Similarly, RLHF tuning often prioritizes short- term fixes over long-term coherence, leading to catastrophic forgetting: Users have reported that optimizing one task in ChatGPT degrades performance in others (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2015). Likewise, addressing an addiction can reveal deeper psychological dependencies and unintended side effects (Sinha, 2008; Torrens et al., 2005).\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a framework in- spired by governmental checks and balances. Our archi- tecture integrates three independent but interacting com- ponents: LLMs serve as the executive for knowledge gen- eration; DIKE (after the Greek goddess of justice) as the legislative, setting ethical standards; and ERIS (after the goddess of discord) as the judicial, providing adversarial testing and cultural interpretation. In mythology, Dike rep- resents order and justice, while her adversary Eris embodies discord, a duality that our framework uses to balance eth- ical guidance with adversarial perspectives. Figure 6 in Appendix G illustrates the architecture.\n\nCentral to this framework is DIKE (Diagnostics, Interpretation, Knowledge-independent learning, and Ethical guardrails), which operates as an independent advisor on behavioral ethics. By decoupling ethical oversight from LLM knowledge processing, DIKE ensures that ethical improvements do not interfere with knowledge representation, while enabling adaptive and culturally aware ethical guidance. For example, while the principle \"do not lie\" generally applies, context-sensitive interpretation may be necessary, such as when a doctor or family member conceals a terminal diagnosis to protect a patient. Likewise, cultural differences in attitudes toward issues such as alcohol consumption, abortion, or same-sex marriage require flexible, context-sensitive ethical reasoning.\n\nThe interplay between DIKE and ERIS introduces four key innovations:\n\n1. Emotion-Driven Behavioral Modeling: Building on BEAM (Behavioral Emotion Analysis Model) (Chang, 2024b), DIKE employs self-supervised learning to ana- lyze how emotions manifest in linguistic behaviors, cre- ating quantifiable relationships between emotional states and their corresponding language patterns in text.\n\n2.

Related Work", "content": "This section surveys existing work on emotion and behav- ior modeling across various domains, with a focus on their applications in AI ethics. We examine how linguistic be- haviors are influenced by emotional patterns and explore structured approaches that integrate emotional frameworks with linguistic models to enhance ethical AI alignment.\n\nWe also examine the shortcomings of RLHF. While effective in refining Al outputs, RLHF often overfits human annota- tions, struggles with adapting to diverse cultural contexts, and may reinforce unintended biases. These challenges high- light the need for a more adaptive and principled approach to ethical AI alignment.\n\n2.1. Emotion Modeling\n\nCognitive-linguistic theories intersect with artificial intelli- gence for understanding AI behavior.

Emotion-Behavior Modeling", "content": "Behaviors are profoundly influenced by emotions, as ini- tially posited by the James-Lange Theory of Emotion (James, 1884; Lange, 1885). According to this theory, emotional experiences arise from physiological reactions to events. Subsequent research, including studies by Damasio (Damasio, 1994; Fauconnier & Turner, 2002), suggests that the expression and regulation of emotions often manifest in the language we use. High-intensity emotions, such as rage or contempt, can lead to aggressive or destructive behaviors, such as hate speech.\n\nThe Schachter-Singer Theory (Schachter & Singer, 1962), or the Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, depicts the role of physiological change and cognitive appraisal change deter- mine the label and strength of emotion. Building on this, the Affect-as-Information Theory developed by Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore (Schwarz & Clore, 1983) posits that people use their current emotions to make judgments and decisions to act. If emotions can be adjusted, so does the behavior. The work of Barbara Fredrickson (Fredrickson, 1998) on the effects of positive emotions discusses how we perceive and react to emotions.\n\nCollectively, these theories elucidate the intricate connection"}, {"title": "2.3. Reinforcement Learning with Human/AI Feedback,\nRLHF vs. RLAIF", "content": "RLHF is the predominant approach to addressing the chal- lenges of AI ethics. This section presents representative works, their advancements, and limitations.\n\nHuman Feedback (RLHF): Initial advancements by Chris- tiano et al. (Christiano et al., 2017) demonstrated how RLHF can steer language models towards desired outcomes based on human preferences. Newer techniques like Identity (\u03a8) Preference Optimization (\u03a8\u03a1\u039f) and Generalized Preference Optimization (GPO) refine this approach by optimizing di- rectly for user preferences, effectively addressing scalabil- ity challenges. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) further simplifies the feedback mechanism by using intu- itive responses such as thumbs-up or thumbs-down, thereby enhancing training efficiency without the need for paired data (Azar et al., 2023; Ethayarajh et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently streamlined the process by focusing on the clear distinction between preferred and less preferred outputs, thus simpli- fying training and enhancing its stability (Rafailov et al., 2024).\n\nAI-generated Feedback (RLAIF): To mitigate reliance on extensive human-generated data, RLAIF utilizes feedback generated by AI. This method capitalizes on the genera- tive capabilities of LLMs to produce training signals au- tonomously (Bai et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). Furthermore, techniques such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) and Relative Preference Optimization (RPO) employ statis- tical methods and calibration techniques to enhance LLM responses. SLiC adjusts sequence generation probabilities to more accurately reflect real-world data distributions, while RPO improves response generation by comparing different response options across both identical and varied prompts. These adjustments significantly increase the training pro- cess's reliability and effectiveness (Yin et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "2.4.

DIKE: Modeling and Regulating Language", "content": "Building on BEAM, DIKE maps emotions to behaviors and introduces an adversarial component, ERIS, to adapt to cul- ture norms and local context.\n\nBEHAVIORS AND EMOTIONS MAPPING USING\nSELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING\nDefine \u03a8 as a behavior spectrum that extends from one pole, \u03a8\u00af, to another, \u03a8+, with intensity levels L. For example, consider a spectrum of letter-writing behaviors with seven distinct intensities ranging from despair (most negative) to joy (most positive). These intensities are sequentially categorized as: 'despair, longing, wishful, neutral, hopeful, contentment, joy.' Given N letters, DIKE employs a self- supervised learning algorithm to generate training data for each letter, modeling L linguistic behaviors in four steps.\n\n1. Rewriting Documents: GPT-4 is used to rewrite a given set of N source documents, each rewritten to reflect L different linguistic behaviors along the defined behavior spectrum \u03a8. This process ensures that each document is systematically transformed to embody specific linguistic styles, ranging from highly assertive to neutral to highly conciliatory, among others. The resulting dataset consists of N \u00d7 L variations of the original documents, each corresponding to a distinct behavior category.\n\n2. Emotion Analysis: For each of the rewritten documents, GPT-4 performs a sentiment and emotion analysis to identify the dominant top M emotions present in the text. The emotions extracted from all N \\times L instances are then compiled and their frequency distributions are recorded. This step quantifies how different linguistic behaviors influence emotional expression, establishing a direct mapping between behavior types and emotional composition.\n\n3. Behavior Vector Creation: For each linguistic behavior \u03a8\u03b9, a corresponding vector \u0393\u03b9 is constructed. This vec- tor captures the identified emotions and their respective frequencies in all N samples that exhibit behavior \u03a8\u03b9. By structuring emotions as a weighted feature set, this step enables precise behavioral categorization based on emotional composition.\n\n4.

These guardrails are informed by ethical norms, legal standards, and societal values, such as those outlined in Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022). For example, G = [\u03a84, \u03a87] indicates that behaviors within intensity levels 4 to 7 are considered acceptable, while any behavior outside this range is classi- fied as a violation.\n\nSystem administrators can tailor ethical guardrails to meet specific requirements. For example, a social media plat- form might adjust G based on the topics discussed and the countries it serves. By integrating these safeguards, DIKE proactively monitors and adjusts LLM responses to enhance ethical compliance. The evaluation and rectification process is composed of the following steps.\n\n1. Initial Classification: DIKE classifies document Dk after evaluation, obtaining \u0393\u03ba, the emotional response vector, and its corresponding linguistic behavior \u03a8\u03b9.\n\n2. Guardrail Check: If \u03a8\u03b9 falls outside the acceptable range G, DIKE suggests adjustments to \u0393k to ensure that Dk complies with ethical guidelines.\n\n3. Adversarial Review by ERIS: The suggested adjustments and I are then reviewed through a structured debate be- tween DIKE and ERIS (the adversarial model) to ensure unbiased recommendations.\n\n4.

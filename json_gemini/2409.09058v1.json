{"title": "Redefining Data-Centric Design: A New Approach with a Domain Model and Core Data Ontology for Computational Systems", "authors": ["William Johnson", "James Davis", "Tara Kelly"], "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative data-centric paradigm for designing computational systems by introducing a new informatics domain model. The proposed model moves away from the conventional node-centric framework and focuses on data-centric categorization, using a multimodal approach that incorporates objects, events, concepts, and actions. By drawing on interdisciplinary research and establishing a foundational ontology based on these core elements, the model promotes semantic consistency and secure data handling across distributed ecosystems. We also explore the implementation of this model as an OWL 2 ontology, discuss its potential applications, and outline its scalability and future directions for research. This work aims to serve as a foundational guide for system designers and data architects in developing more secure, interoperable, and scalable data systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The creation of the Internet on January 1, 1983, marked a transformative shift in global connectivity, establishing a new era for communication networks. Before this, fragmented computer networks struggled to communicate seamlessly. The introduction of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) enabled consistent data transfer and became the standard for digital communication. However, this node-centric approach, which relies heavily on Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, has also created significant security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns due to its focus on network nodes rather than the data itself.\nIn today's digital landscape, the centralized aggregation and storage of sensitive user data including IP addresses by service providers pose substantial security risks. These centralized repositories are prime targets for cyberattacks, potentially compromising user privacy and exposing sensitive information. Additionally, the reliance on IP-based system modeling has amplified these risks, necessitating a shift toward a more secure and resilient design approach."}, {"title": "2. Problem Statement", "content": "Current computational systems are challenged by outdated informatics models that inadequately prioritize data semantics. Traditional node-centric models, which focus on securing IP addresses during data transmission, often treat data semantics as an afterthought, addressed only during data curation. This approach frequently leads to inefficient schema design, resulting in poorly structured data that undermines security and interoperability.\nOne major challenge in existing models relates to the cryptographic principles of data \"integrity\" and \"authenticity.\" While both are essential for ensuring data reliability during transmission and storage, they are often not maintained simultaneously, leading to security weaknesses. For example, ensuring the authenticity of a data source does not always guarantee the integrity of the associated metadata or content, complicating the preservation of the original context throughout the data lifecycle.\nThe current data landscape also faces issues related to data quality, particularly with unstructured data, which constitutes around 80% of recorded data. Unlike structured data tied to metadata, unstructured data is less accessible for analysis by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical tools. As a result, there is a pressing need for a new model that prioritizes data semantics from the outset to ensure data is consistently interpretable, secure, and meaningful across various digital ecosystems."}, {"title": "3.

Subsequent phases of the research included developing the core ontology in 2023, which provides a flexible framework for dynamic data categorization and search within distributed systems.\nBy adopting this rigorous, interdisciplinary approach, the model provides a versatile foundation for understanding and managing the complexities of data-centric design in computational systems."}, {"title": "5.

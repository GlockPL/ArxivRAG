Introduction", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are shaping the future of healthcare by applying advanced data analysis, predictive modeling, and decision support systems. The application of AI in healthcare allows for the identification of complex patterns in patient data, improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and operational efficiency [1]. Healthcare providers are increasingly leveraging predictive analytics to foresee health outcomes, enabling earlier interventions and more targeted care [2][26]. For instance, AI models have proven effective in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing preventive care strategies [3]. Diabetes, a major global health challenge, requires early detection and preventive care. Predictive models built using accessible tools like BigQuery ML can help healthcare professionals identify at-risk individuals efficiently.\nCloud computing serves as a critical tool for AI and ML in healthcare, addressing many of the technical and infrastructural challenges associated with large-scale data analysis.

Background", "content": "The intersection of AI and healthcare has been extensively studied, with particular emphasis on predictive analytics for chronic disease management. Diabetes, a global health challenge affecting millions, has been a focal point for such research due to its significant health and economic impacts. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential of ML models in identifying diabetes risk using health indicators such as age, BMI, and blood pressure [11][12][13]. However, traditional ML approaches, including logistic regression and support vector machines, often require significant computational resources and specialized expertise, limiting their application in resource-constrained clinical environments.\nStudies indicate that cloud-based ML has streamlined healthcare analytics by facilitating efficient data processing and model management [14]. While AWS and Azure provide comprehensive tools for machine learning, they require significant programming expertise and do not natively integrate SQL-based workflows. BigQuery ML, on the other hand, allows users to execute machine learning tasks within a single environment using SQL, making it particularly accessible for healthcare professionals without technical expertise. Table 1 summarizes the key features, advantages, and limitations of BigQuery ML compared to other leading platforms such as AWS SageMaker and Azure ML, highlighting its unique suitability for healthcare analytics.\nPlatforms like BigQuery ML allow users to build and deploy machine learning models directly through SQL, reducing the technical barriers associated with traditional ML pipelines. BigQuery ML's ability to integrate seamlessly with healthcare datasets offers a powerful tool for healthcare professionals without programming expertise, democratizing access to advanced analytics. Despite these advantages, there is limited literature on the practical application of BigQuery ML in healthcare settings, particularly for large-scale datasets [8]. This study leverages the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of BigQuery ML in a healthcare context. By utilizing SQL-based ML workflows, we aim to provide a framework for healthcare professionals to implement predictive analytics with minimal technical overhead, thereby addressing a critical gap in existing research."}, {"title": "2.1 Related Studies and Literature Gap", "content": "Most existing research relies on programming-intensive platforms requiring Python, R, or specialized ML frameworks, which create barriers for non-technical users. Limited studies explore SQL-based machine learning tools like BigQuery ML, which provide an accessible alternative for healthcare professionals lacking programming expertise. While studies have evaluated ML performance in healthcare using conventional programming methods, the accessibility and efficiency of SQL-driven ML workflows remain underexplored.\nThis gap is particularly significant given that SQL is widely used in healthcare data analytics [27][28][29], making it a natural choice for enabling predictive modeling without additional programming knowledge. Prior studies have not focused on how healthcare professionals can leverage SQL for ML without requiring external tools, manual data movement, or complex ML frameworks. BigQuery ML addresses this gap by allowing professionals to leverage the power of machine learning directly through SQL commands, making it an ideal solution for real-world healthcare applications. SQL remains one of the most widely used programming languages worldwide, consistently ranking among the top three in 2024 [27]. This widespread familiarity makes SQL a natural choice for professionals in healthcare analytics, enabling them to leverage existing skills for advanced machine learning tasks without requiring extensive technical training.\nWhile alternative tools like Weka and ChatGPT offer unique approaches to machine learning workflows, they fall short in key aspects that are critical for real-world healthcare applications. Weka, for example, is a GUI-driven tool suitable for standalone ML studies but lacks integration with cloud platforms, making it inefficient for handling large-scale datasets or real-time analysis. Additionally, Weka requires users to export and import data manually, increasing the likelihood of errors and inefficiencies. Similarly, while ChatGPT can generate ML code through descriptive prompts, it assumes the user has a basic understanding of programming to interpret, test, and refine the code. Furthermore, ChatGPT does not provide a cloud environment to execute the generated code or access integrated tools such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or Vertex AI. In contrast, BigQuery ML operates within the Google Cloud ecosystem, enabling direct interaction with databases and other cloud tools. This capability streamlines the entire data workflow, from ingestion to model training and deployment, without requiring external environments or tools.\nThis study addresses this gap by showcasing BigQuery ML as a fully integrated cloud-based ML solution, demonstrating how it can be applied to structured healthcare data without requiring programming expertise or ML-specific knowledge."}, {"title": "2.2 Research Question", "content": "Given the increasing demand for accessible ML solutions in healthcare and the gap in research on SQL-driven ML platforms, this study aims to address the following research question:\n\"How effectively can BigQuery ML be utilized for predictive healthcare analytics, and how does it compare in terms of accessibility, ease of use, and performance to other cloud-based ML solutions?\"\nThis question is driven by the need to evaluate the feasibility of SQL-based ML workflows for healthcare professionals, as well as the potential advantages and limitations of using BigQuery ML for predictive analytics.

This telephone survey collects health-related data from over 400,000 Americans each year, focusing on health risk behaviors, chronic conditions, and preventive healthcare services. For this study, we used a refined 2015 BRFSS dataset, publicly available in CSV format on Kaggle. The dataset includes responses from 70,692 individuals, evenly balanced between non-diabetic (0) and pre-diabetic or diabetic (1) individuals. The target variable for this study is Diabetes_binary, which indicates whether a respondent has diabetes (1) or not (0).\nTo build our predictive models, we selected 21 key health indicators relevant to diabetes prediction. These features include demographic factors, lifestyle habits, and clinical indicators that have been commonly linked to diabetes risk in prior research [22]."}, {"title": "3.3 Machine Learning Models", "content": "To apply BigQuery ML for healthcare analytics, three predictive models were selected: Logistic Regression, Boosted Trees, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). While BigQuery ML supports a range of models, these models span a spectrum of complexity, from interpretable linear models to advanced ensemble methods and deep learning architectures. Their selection is based on prior research in healthcare predictive modeling, where they have shown effectiveness in disease prediction tasks.\nLogistic Regression \u2013 Chosen as a baseline model due to its interpretability and effectiveness for binary classification, making it particularly useful in clinical decision-making [19].\nBoosted Trees \u2013 Selected for its ability to capture complex relationships between features and improve classification accuracy through an iterative learning process [20].\nDeep Neural Networks (DNN) \u2013 Applied to explore the potential of deep learning in detecting high-dimensional patterns within structured healthcare datasets [21].\nJustification for model selection is that while BigQuery ML supports various machine learning models, these three were deliberately chosen to showcase its capabilities across different levels of complexity; Logistic Regression serves as an interpretable, easy-to-use model for healthcare professionals with minimal ML expertise. Boosted Trees provide an intermediate-level approach, offering improved predictive performance while remaining interpretable. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) demonstrate how BigQuery ML can handle more complex, computationally demanding models without requiring external tools or custom infrastructure.\nThis selection highlights how BigQuery ML enables users to scale from simple ML applications to advanced AI-driven healthcare solutions within a SQL-based environment.

Data Preparation", "content": "Schema Validation and Compatibility: BigQuery ML validates the schema during ingestion and training to ensure compatibility between the dataset and the machine learning model. This step reduces the likelihood of errors caused by data mismatches, streamlining the overall process and maintaining data integrity. By leveraging Google Cloud Storage and BigQuery, the data preparation and loading process became highly efficient and scalable, laying a strong foundation for subsequent model creation and training tasks.\nAutomatic Preprocessing in BigQuery ML: One of the advantages of BigQuery ML is its built-in automatic preprocessing, which eliminates the need for extensive manual data preparation. Automatic preprocessing consists of missing value imputation and feature transformations, ensuring consistency and efficiency in model training.\nMissing Value Imputation: BigQuery ML automatically imputes missing values based on data type. For example, numerical features are replaced with the mean value, while categorical features are assigned to a special missing category. This prevents model failures due to missing data and ensures robust training.\nFeature Transformations: Feature Transformations: BigQuery ML automatically standardizes numerical features (zero mean, unit variance) for logistic regression and DNNs, ensuring consistent feature scaling. Boosted trees and random forests do not require standardization, as they handle raw feature values natively.\nCategorical Feature Encoding: BigQuery ML supports various encoding methods for categorical variables, including one-hot encoding, dummy encoding, label encoding, and target encoding. The choice of encoding depends on the model type, and details are available in the official documentation [30].\nManual Data Preprocessing using SQL: While BigQuery ML automates preprocessing, additional SQL-based feature engineering techniques can be applied for greater customization. Missing values can be handled with SQL queries by applying imputation techniques-numerical variables can be filled using the median, and categorical variables can be encoded using one-hot encoding. Additionally, feature selection can be conducted by calculating correlations between each feature and the target variable (diabetes_binary) using SQL-based statistical functions. These features streamline the data preparation process, allowing all preprocessing steps to be completed within the BigQuery environment without requiring external tools or programming. Figure 2.a demonstrates a sample SQL query for handling missing values, while Figure 2.b shows an example of categorical encoding. Figure 2.c illustrates how SQL can be used to calculate correlations for feature selection."}, {"title": "4. Results and Discussion", "content": "This section evaluates the performance of Logistic Regression, Boosted Tree, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models using key metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, accuracy, and log loss.

Section 4.5 discusses ROC curves and model discrimination ability. Section 4.6 provides a comparative analysis of model performance,"}, {"title": "4.1. Evaluation Metrics", "content": "Model evaluation is a critical aspect of the machine learning process, especially in healthcare applications where predictive accuracy has real-world implications. The performance of the models, Logistic Regression, Boosted Tree, and Deep Neural Network (DNN), was assessed using multiple metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, accuracy, and log loss. BigQuery ML provides these metrics along with visual tools such as confidence threshold plots, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves. These tools are particularly useful in healthcare contexts for exploring model performance across various thresholds and understanding trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, offering deeper insights into the strengths and limitations of each model.\nIn BigQuery ML, each trained model is automatically saved within the specified dataset. This built-in storage allows users to retrieve performance metrics directly from the model and streamlines the evaluation process. BigQuery ML's ML.PREDICT function also allows users to generate predictions on new or unseen data directly within BigQuery, integrating predictive analytics seamlessly into healthcare workflows.\nThe key evaluation metrics used in this study include:\n1. Precision (P): Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases among all positive predictions. High precision reduces false positives [23].\nPrecision = $\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$\nwhere TP is true positives and FP is false positive.\n2. Recall (Sensitivity, R): Represents the proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified by the model. High recall ensures minimal false negatives [23].\nRecall = $\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$\nwhere FN is false negatives.\n3. F1 Score: The harmonic means of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics [24][25].\nF1 Score = $2 \\times \\frac{Precision \\times Recall}{Precision + Recall}$\n4. Accuracy (A): The ratio of correctly predicted cases (both positive and negative) to the total cases.\nAccuracy = $2\\times \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$\nwhere TN is true negative.\n5. Log Loss: A metric used for probabilistic predictions, penalizing incorrect confidence levels. Lower log loss indicates better performance.\nLog Loss = $-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ([y_i log(\\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i)log(1 - \\hat{y_i})])$ \nN represents the total number of samples, $y_i$ denotes the actual class label (0 or 1), and $\\hat{y_i}$ refers to the predicted probability of the positive class (1).\n6. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes across different thresholds. A higher AUC indicates better discrimination between positive and negative cases.\nAUC = $\\int_{0}^{1} TPR(FPR)d(FPR)$"}, {"title": "4.2. Confidence Threshold vs Precision/Recall", "content": "The leftmost panels in Figure 4 depict the relationship between confidence thresholds, precision, and recall for the three models. These graphs illustrate how the precision and recall values change as the confidence threshold is adjusted. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall indicates the proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified by the model.\nFor the Boosted Tree model, precision and recall intersect at a balanced threshold, highlighting its ability to maintain a robust trade-off between the two metrics. The DNN model exhibits a similar pattern, with both precision and recall values demonstrating consistent performance as the threshold varies. In contrast, the Logistic Regression model shows a steeper decline in recall as the threshold increases, emphasizing its limitations in preserving sensitivity at higher confidence levels.\nUnderstanding these trade-offs is crucial in healthcare, where high recall is often prioritized to minimize false negatives, such as undiagnosed diabetes cases. By analyzing these graphs, practitioners can identify thresholds that align with clinical priorities, ensuring that the selected model meets the specific needs of the application while balancing precision and recall effectively."}, {"title": "4.3. Precision-Recall Curve", "content": "The middle panels in Figure 4 illustrate the precision-recall curves for the models. These curves provide a detailed view of the relationship between precision and recall across different thresholds. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) is a critical metric for evaluating a model's ability to maintain high recall without sacrificing precision. For the Boosted Tree model, the AUC-PR is 0.808, indicating strong performance in identifying true positives while minimizing false positives. This robustness is particularly valuable in healthcare applications, where accurate identification of diabetes cases is essential. The DNN model achieved an AUC-PR of 0.797, slightly lower than the Boosted Tree but still demonstrates reliable performance. In contrast, the Logistic Regression model exhibited an AUC-PR of 0.748, highlighting its comparatively lower ability to balance precision and recall. Precision-recall curves are especially useful for imbalanced datasets, such as the diabetes dataset, where the positive class (diabetes cases) is relatively rare. By analyzing these curves, healthcare practitioners can gain insights into the models' trade-offs, enabling the selection of the most suitable model for their specific needs."}, {"title": "4.4. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve", "content": "The rightmost panels in Figure 4 show the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the models. These curves are essential for evaluating a model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes by plotting the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate across various thresholds. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) provides a single, comprehensive metric to summarize the model's discriminatory power. For the Boosted Tree model, the AUC-ROC is 0.834, demonstrating its strong ability to differentiate between individuals with and without diabetes. This high value highlights the model's reliability in achieving a balance between sensitivity and specificity, critical for healthcare applications. The DNN model follows closely with an AUC-ROC of 0.83, showcasing comparable discriminatory power. The Logistic Regression model, while simpler, achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.778, indicating a modest but effective performance in distinguishing between the two classes. ROC curves are particularly valuable in healthcare scenarios where minimizing false negatives (e.g., missed diabetes cases) is essential. By analyzing the ROC curves, healthcare professionals can determine optimal thresholds that prioritize sensitivity while maintaining reasonable specificity, ensuring effective interventions for at-risk patients."}, {"title": "4.5. Comparative Insights", "content": "Among the evaluated models, the Boosted Tree model achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score of 0.7626 and an AUC-ROC of 0.8339 (see Table 1). These metrics were chosen to determine the best-performing model as they provide a balanced assessment of classification performance, particularly in healthcare applications where both false positives and false negatives must be minimized. The F1-score is widely recognized as an essential metric when dealing with class imbalance, as it accounts for both precision and recall. In diabetes prediction, missing a positive case (false negative) can lead to delayed diagnosis and worsened health outcomes, making recall particularly critical. However, an excessive focus on recall could lead to more false positives, which may overburden healthcare resources. Therefore, a model that optimally balances these factors-such as Boosted Tree-offers clinical and operational advantages in a real-world healthcare setting."}, {"title": "4.6. Feature Importance Analysis for the Boosted Tree Model", "content": "Feature importance helps us understand which variables contribute the most to the model's predictions. For the boosted tree classifier, we used importance gain as the primary metric. Importance gain measures how much a feature improves decision splits in the model, meaning higher values indicate more influential predictors. The results indicate that High Blood Pressure (HighBP) is the most significant predictor of diabetes, followed by General Health (GenHlth). This aligns with medical expectations, as high blood pressure and overall health perception are strongly associated with metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Other key features influencing diabetes prediction include Age, BMI, and High Cholesterol (HighChol), all of which are well-documented risk factors for diabetes. Difficulty Walking (DiffWalk), Heavy Alcohol Consumption, and History of Heart Disease or Attack also show moderate importance, reflecting broader cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes. Lifestyle factors such as Physical Activity, Smoking Status, and Vegetable Consumption have relatively lower importance in this model. While these factors influence overall health, their specific contribution to diabetes risk is smaller compared to the dominant predictors. To better illustrate the impact of each feature, we present a bar chart showing the importance gain of all features in Figure 5. Higher values indicate stronger predictive power."}, {"title": "4.7.

Additionally, bias detection techniques and fairness-aware machine learning approaches could be integrated into BigQuery ML workflows.\nInterpretability of Complex Models: While Boosted Trees and Logistic Regression models in BigQuery ML offer transparency and interpretability, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) lack explainability, making them less suitable for high-stakes medical decision-making. To improve interpretability, techniques such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be integrated with BigQuery ML workflows. Future research can explore post-hoc interpretability frameworks that enhance model trustworthiness for healthcare applications.\nImage-Based Machine Learning Limitations: BigQuery ML is optimized for structured, tabular datasets and does not natively support image-based machine learning. For healthcare applications involving medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans), specialized tools such as Google Cloud AutoML Vision and TensorFlow should be considered. However, metadata associated with image datasets (e.g., diagnostic labels, patient history) can still be processed using BigQuery ML, providing valuable insights when combined with clinical data. Future work can explore hybrid workflows, where image analysis is performed using deep learning models in Vertex AI or TensorFlow, while BigQuery ML is used for structured data integration and analysis.\nManual Hyperparameter Tuning: BigQuery ML currently does not support automated hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search or random search). Instead, users must manually specify parameters in SQL queries, adjusting learning rates, iterations, and tree depths based on model performance. This manual tuning process may require additional effort compared to platforms like AWS SageMaker or Azure ML, which offer automated tuning features.

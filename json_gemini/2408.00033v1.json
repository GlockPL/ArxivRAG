In industrial applications, fault diagnosis involves the identification of the root cause of a fault or anomaly, while prognosis involves the prediction of the remaining useful life of equipment or the time to failure. Effective fault diagnosis and prognosis can help prevent unexpected shutdowns, reduce maintenance costs, and improve overall process efficiency. However, achieving accurate and reliable fault diagnosis and prognosis in industrial applications is a challenging task, due to the complexity of modern industrial processes, the presence of noise and uncertainty in sensor data, and the need for real-time decision-making [1]. The Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of process control and fault diagnosis, has been used to evaluate the performance of various fault diagnosis and prognosis methods, including machine learning algorithms, model-based approaches, and hybrid methods. The results of these studies have demonstrated the potential of advanced fault diagnosis and prognosis techniques to improve process efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance overall process reliability in industrial applications [2].\nLSTM networks, a specialized form of recurrent neural networks, have become prominent in time series prediction and classification due to their effectiveness across diverse domains. Their unique ability to recognize temporal dependencies and complex patterns within sequential data, facilitated by memory cells in their architecture, proves valuable for modeling time-dependent phenomena [3]. LSTM networks have proven to be valuable tools in various applications, including industrial machinery fault detection, predictive maintenance for wind turbines, anomaly detection in network traffic, fault diagnosis in electrical systems, and predictive maintenance for aircraft engines [4], [5]. BiLSTM can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in time series data, while LSTM can only capture long-term dependencies. This makes BiLSTM better suited for tasks that require understanding both short-term and long-term patterns, such as natural language processing, fault detection, time series prediction [6]. The use of these recurrent neural network architectures has enabled the development of more accurate and reliable fault detection systems, which can significantly reduce downtime, improve maintenance scheduling, and enhance overall system reliability. Furthermore, the ability of LSTM and BiLSTM models to handle large amounts of data and adapt to changing system conditions has made them an attractive solution for real-time fault detection and predictive maintenance applications [7].\nThe advent of attention mechanisms has revolutionized the field of time series analysis and dynamic data modeling, enabling researchers and practitioners to unlock new insights and improve predictive capabilities [8]. attention mechanisms, inspired by the human brain's ability to focus on relevant information, have introduced a paradigm shift in the way we process and analyze sequential data. By selectively weighting and aggregating input features, attention mechanisms allow models to dynamically adapt to changing patterns and context, effectively \"focusing\" on the most informative segments of the data [9]. This has led to significant improvements in tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation, particularly in domains characterized by high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and noisy data. Moreover, attention-based models have been shown to be more interpretable and transparent, providing valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the data and facilitating the identification of key drivers and relationships [10]. The impact of attention mechanisms has been felt across various fields, including finance, healthcare, climate science, and transportation, where the ability to accurately model and predict complex temporal phenomena has far-reaching implications for decision-making, risk management, and policy development treniot [11]. As the complexity and volume of time series data continue to grow, the role of attention mechanisms in unlocking new possibilities for dynamic data modeling and analysis is likely to become even more pronounced, driving innovation and breakthroughs in a wide range of applications.\nIn this study, a novel fault detection and cause identification methodology for the TEP is presented, employing a combination of a BiLSTM network and a novel Integrated Attention Mechanism (IAM). The innovations are emphasized as follows:\n\u2022\tFeature Extraction with Attention Mechanism: Initially, the attention mechanism is employed to extract important features, discerning their significance in the fault detection process. By calculating attention weights, this approach identifies features that exert a substantial effect on the model's decision-making, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of the selected features for fault detection. Greater attention weights suggest increased importance, pointing to features that play a significant role in influencing the model's output.\n\u2022\tProposed IAM: This approach integrates the strengths of scaled dot product attention, residual attention, and dynamic attention mechanism to create a comprehensive and adaptive attention mechanism. By leveraging the simplicity and relevance computation of dot product attention, addressing vanishing gradients with the residual attention's residual connection, and incorporating the adaptability of dynamic attention to input sequences. The IAM aims to provide a well-rounded solution that captures nuanced patterns and dependencies in diverse tasks.\n\u2022\tThe Significance of Attention Mechanism in Post-BiLSTM Output for Fault Detection:\nThe output generated by the BiLSTM, enriched by the attention mechanism, serves as a refined representation of the input sequence. This post-LSTM output, with enhanced contextual understanding and salient features highlighted by attention, contributes to improved fault detection results. The collaboration between attention mechanisms and BiLSTM optimizes the model's ability to capture intricate patterns, enhancing overall performance in fault detection applications.\nThe simulation results validate the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy compared to existing approaches [12] and [13].\nThis paper is organized into five sections.

The dataset was created by the Eastman Chemical Company in the 1980s to simulate a realistic industrial process control problem. The TEP dataset simulates a chemical process that involves the production of a hypothetical product, G, from four reactants, A, C, D, and E. The process consists of five major units: a reactor, a condenser, a separator, a stripper, and a recycle stream. The reactor is a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) where the reactants are mixed and reacted to form the product. The condenser is used to condense the vapor stream from the reactor, and the separator is used to separate the liquid and vapor streams. The stripper is used to remove impurities from the product, and the recycle stream is used to recycle unreacted reactants back to the reactor. The dataset includes 52 measured variables, including temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and compositions, which are sampled every 3 minutes. These variables are used to monitor and control the process, and to detect and diagnose faults [42].\nThe TEP dataset is particularly useful for testing and evaluating process control and fault diagnosis algorithms because it includes 21 pre-defined fault scenarios, which simulate common process faults such as valve failures, sensor faults, and process disturbances. Each fault scenario is designed to test a specific aspect of process control and fault diagnosis, such as fault detection, isolation, and identification. For example, Fault 1 simulates a step change in the A/C feed ratio, which can cause a disturbance in the process. Fault 2 simulates a sticking valve in the condenser, which can cause a change in the condenser pressure. Fault 3 simulates a sensor failure in the reactor temperature measurement, which can cause a false reading of the reactor temperature. The fault scenarios are designed to be challenging, but not impossible, to detect and diagnose, making the TEP dataset a useful tool for evaluating the performance of process control and fault diagnosis algorithms. The dataset has been widely used in academic and industrial research to evaluate the performance of various process control and fault diagnosis methods, including statistical process control, machine learning, and model-based approaches [43].\nThe TEP dataset has been widely used in various research studies to evaluate the performance of different process control and fault diagnosis methods. For example, researchers have used the TEP dataset to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and support vector machines, for fault detection and diagnosis. Other researchers have used the TEP dataset to evaluate the performance of model-based approaches, such as model predictive control and state estimation, for process control and fault diagnosis. The dataset has also been used to evaluate the performance of statistical process control methods, such as control charts and statistical process monitoring, for fault detection and diagnosis. The TEP dataset is available for download from various online sources, and it has become a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of process control and fault diagnosis algorithms.

The attention weights, calculated using a Softmax activation function, show how important different parts of the input are. The application of these attention weights facilitates the synthesis of an attended input from the provided value vectors.

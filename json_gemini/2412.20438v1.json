INTRODUCTION", "content": "The financial sector is an important and a driving force of the worldwide economic development and it is having a rapid development due to the use of the latest intelligent technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP). The period of 2018-2023 covered in this research paper implies an important one, where NLPs have seen an exponential growth with the Large Language Models (LLMs) projects like ChatGPTs, Gemini, Bard and Bing exploration and models deeper specifications.\nFor the scope of this research paper, we refer to the Finance field as the Financial System (FS) as it encompasses various components such as; public finance, international finance, corporate finance, derivatives, risk management, portfolio theory, asset pricing (AP), and financial economics [1].\nA detailed view of the search methods and machine learning tools in language processing, including classifiers and sequence models, techniques like decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and cross-validation is essential for evaluating NLP systems [2]. We will give examples of the use of NLP techniques in the next sections in this research, enhancing their understanding by delivering the research questions as following:\nQ1: What are the NLP models and techniques used for analyzing FS components in the time span of 2018-2023?\nQ2: What are the challenges and limitations in the applications of NLP to the FS regarding text-mining applications on the engineering perspective of data processing?"}, {"title": "2.

For the scope of this research paper, we classified and analyzed around sixty (60) study materials."}, {"title": "2.2. Results", "content": "Figure 1 shows that the focus of most studies relies on AP, (especially on stock prediction), while having the corporate finances as the second most studied component of FS.\nWe noticed a growing number of articles which combined both probabilistic with VSM, and also combined text-data with numerical ones. A systematic and critical review of deep learning in financial economics is provided by using hybrid variants of methods [3]. The work [4] forecasted economic trends using sentiment analysis, AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX) and Lasso on data from articles from six newspapers showing varying levels of accuracy. The Numeric Hierarchical Transformer Model (NumHTML) for financial forecasting using earning conference calls data was introduced in the year of 2022 [5]. As these studies remain near the financial economics area, they also might have infusions of other topics, showing at least, a low interest on the matter.\nA textual analysis of China's financial markets is conducted with sentiment analysis [6]. The work of [30] used transformers for sentiment analysis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) news. Datasets on the international finance FS component are of various data sources, as they help to create an international point of view on the topic.\nAs for the portfolio theory application of NLPs, we can elaborate works that underpin the interconnection of the fields of FS and NLP. An important work [7] applies financial Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (FinBERT), Monte Carlo, and Black and Litterman model for portfolio optimization on Milano Finanza data. Whereas, [28] investigated the importance of financial sentiment in portfolio management using RF, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and LSTM on data from Quandl and StockFluence APIs. Here we have to mention even the use of datasets from other sectors for training models, which can be sub-optimal, highlighting the need for more sector-specific annotated datasets [8,9,10]. The diverse number of techniques used, show of a versatile sub-field, where data and information are not absent, but needs more attention in the future, for taking proper financial decisions and predictions to the investors.\nThe public finance component is elaborated in some works below though, there is a need to be further investigated. Work of [11] applied machine learning to budget speech statements. The article of [12] examined tax compliance behavior using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) on survey responses. A bank financial risk prediction model is developed using big data from commercial banks, employing Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) and SVM [29]. The SVM techniques [13] and hybrid deep learning models [14] show their global use in different fields, we can mention the healthcare one. Whereas the finance field is evolving, the need for intelligent methods is rising, as it is a crucial point when taking financial decisions, and is applied thoroughly in every other component presented above.\nThrough our work we saw that the stock predictions remain the most studied topic, in the AP component of the FS, and that the AP component of the FS is the most studied topic compared to other components. There might be different reasons, but what we can deduce is that there are more open databases that allow the latter topic to be studied and also, it is a very fast needed information. An investor has to have an accurate and timely information on stocks or in AP, in order to take proper decision. There is evidenced a variety of datasets utilized, including financial news databases. stock returns data, corporate financial reports (e.g., 10-K filings), and social media data (e.g., StockTwits, Weibo).\nThe most used common specific techniques, as presented in Figure 3. include BERT types, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Logistic Regression (LR), whereas Lasso, Bag of Words (Bow), NEUS, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Autoregressive"}, {"title": "3. DISCUSSION", "content": "This research highlighted several limitations on the text engineering perspective in the application of NLP to FSs in order to answer to Q2. It leverages the past works' [15] limitations and challenges (restriction to confidential data, absence of well-defined financial lexicon lists, lack of dynamic texts analysis models, need of club inter-domain results, highly un-structured and redundant data, sarcasm and vernacular language) are not fully appointed yet. Let us point out the evolution of the challenges from the time of the study's [15] analysis to the end of the year 2023. A significant issue is the data shift between training corpora and real estate headlines, leading to poor performance in event extraction [16]. Traditional models like the Fama-French 5-factor model (FF5) face overfitting problems, highlighting superiority of newer models like Generalized News-based Sentiment Analysis (GNUS) [17].\nWhereas even the latter like deep learning models encounter challenges with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) samples, time-varying distributions, and low signal-to-noise ratios, complicating stock return predictions such as in [18]. Refs. [17, 18] indicate a partially addressed issue of Gupta, et al. [15] challenges to the lack of dynamic text analysis models. There is a limited interpretability of advanced models like BERT and Word2Vec that restricts their application, particularly when not trained on domain-specific texts [19, 20]. The sentiment analysis models often fail to capture financial context adequately due to reliance on general lexicons [21], a challenge not yet solved since the research paper [15] reference on absence of well-defined financial lexicon lists.\nFurther, data quality and causality issues persist, making it difficult to establish reliable links between sentiment indicators and outcomes [22]. The overreliance on numerical data in models overlooks qualitative factors like managerial experience, which could enhance predictions [23]. The matter of scalability and adaptability of models to real-time data remain challenging, particularly in evolving financial markets [24]. Even the expert annotations based on prior beliefs can be incorrect, emphasizing need for context-based annotations [25]. The infancy of text analysis in finance requires comprehensive research to fully understand its potential [4].\nAdditionally, the use of datasets from other sectors for training models can be sub-optimal, highlighting the need for more sector-specific annotated datasets [10]. Future research should take into consideration market frictions and transaction costs in trading strategies [26]. While some [15] challenges are mentioned above, the other ones such restriction to confidential data, need of club inter-domain results, highly un-structured and redundant data, sarcasm and vernacular language and the new ones we presented above resonate a need to address them as quickly as possible. Lastly, we can state that advanced NLP models show promise but require further investigation to address their current limitations and optimize their use in financial predictions [27]."}, {"title": "4. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "Despite the limitations, NLP holds substantial promise for enhancing the FS. Their mixed applications can significantly improve the accuracy of predictions, such as stock prices and asset returns, by taking large amounts of textual data from news articles, social media, and financial reports. Advanced models like BERT and LSTM, and their modified models, have demonstrated superior performance in capturing the nuances of financial language and predicting market movements. Integrating deep learning techniques into financial models not only enhances prediction accuracy but also helps uncover underlying economic mechanisms, offering deeper empirical insights into AP. Furthermore, NLP can facilitate better sentiment analysis, crucial for gauging market sentiment and making informed investment decisions.\nAdvancements in transfer learning and domain adaptation are promising for addressing data shift issues, thereby improving model robustness and generalization. As the field progresses, developing more interpretable AI models will enhance transparency and trust, making NLP an indispensable tool for financial analysts and researchers.\nThe FS components of AP and corporate finance remain amongst most elaborated with NLP techniques, while the other components have a small number of studies. Amongst NLP models, the most used remain the probabilistic and VSM models, whereas the most used techniques remain the information classification and hybrid techniques. Overall, while advanced NLP and deep learning models show great promise for financial applications, ongoing research must address these limitations to enhance their accuracy, interpretability, and applicability. Future research should focus on refining models to account for local market dynamics, improving data quality and annotation methods, and developing more sophisticated algorithms capable of handling the complex and dynamic nature of financial data."}]}

The clinical treatments require temperature feedback must be rapid and accurate. Purpose: This work aims to enhance temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction with an improved deep learning method, to ensure the safety and effectiveness of FUS treatments.\nMethods: The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The used neural networks were cascade net, complex valued U-Net, shift window transformer for MRI, real valued U-Net and U-Net with residual block. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. In datasets, the ground-truth was the complex MR images with accurate temperature increases. These data were also manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy.\nResults: Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2x and 4\u00d7 k-space under-sampling strategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In 2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 \u00b0C and 1.145 \u00b0C on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43 \u00b0C isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.253 \u00b0C with the apart of \u00b12.16 \u00b0C. In 4\u00d7 under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately 10%.\nConclusion: This study demonstrates that the application of deep learning-based reconstruction significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of MR thermometry, particularly benefiting the clinical thermal therapies for uterine fibroid, essential tremor, and prostate cancer by FUS.\nThe source code for our optimizing methods and neural networks is available at: https://github.com/minipuding/FastMRT.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry is widely used in noninvasive surgical treatments by focused ultrasound (FUS)[1]. However, achieving real-time temperature measurement that preserves temperature information using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly challenging due to the underlying imaging principles. Such surgeries require the continuous acquisition of approximately ten frames for each ablation, with each frame taking approximately two seconds. A complete uterine fibroid ablation procedure typically lasts between two and four hours, with a considerable portion of the time dedicated to image acquisition. The use of temperature monitoring intervals lasting seconds still poses a certain degree of safety risk to patients[2]. Throughout the procedure, patients must remain motionless to prevent any hazardous circumstances, which can be highly distressing for them.\nFast imaging based on the reconstruction of under-sampled magnetic resonance images has been in development for several years and has shown great potential to significantly increase the speed of temperature measurement. Most studies in the area of MRI temperature measurement use conventional methods, such as parallel imaging and compress sensing[3, 4]. The accelerated MR thermometry through coil-sensitivity encoding was generally accompanied by a decrease in temperature accuracy[5]. Besides that, the reduced field of view (FOV) method might be an alternative for fast temperature measurements, but the absence of a full-FOV monitor increased the risk of ablation treatments. More advanced non-cartesian readout strategies such as spiral and radial MR thermometry proposed by Kisoo and Pooja et al, can achieve volumetric and motion-immune temperature measurements with a temporal resolution of 100 300 ms for each slice[6, 7]. However, our novel deep learning-based rapid reconstruction method was non-conflicting with these sampling strategies. The spiral and radial k-space data can also be under-sampled to reach higher imaging speeds, and accelerated imaging via reconstruction in this study was also applicable. The work to be done is to train a specialized reconstruction model for them through our proposed method. In addition, the rapid echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence was validated for temperature measurements by Andrew and Henrik et al[8, 9]. Nevertheless, the segmented or single-shot EPI was always vulnerable to B0 inhomogeneities. The irresistible susceptibility led to a significant reduction in the clinical acceptability of using this sequence for temperature measurements[10, 11]. Furthermore, the temperature increase-induced focus shift remains a difficult and not well-resolved problem. In contrast, the rapid reconstruction method we proposed for cartesian-based gradient echo sequences was more robust.\nSince the inception of the fast MRI challenge[12, 13], numerous deep learning-based MRI reconstruction techniques[14, 15] have been proposed. Following the emergence of Vision Transformer (ViT)[16], several transformer-based reconstruction methods have also been proposed[17, 18, 19]. However, magnetic resonance thermometry encounters two major issues when attempting to apply existing fast imaging algorithms. Firstly, the most commonly used temperature measurement method, proton resonance frequency (PRF) shift[20], relies on the phase discrepancy of complex images. However, current fast MRI methods primarily focus on reconstructing amplitude images, with little emphasis on phase[21]. As a result, these methods are suboptimal for preserving phase information in magnetic resonance temperature measurement, lacking specific design or improvement for this purpose. Secondly, current undersampling reconstruction methods prioritize image quality restoration over time preservation, leading to increasingly larger and more complex models with insufficient attention to the impact of model inference time on actual acceleration rates[22]. Furthermore, insufficient datasets may result in limited model's performance due to overfitting and underutilization.\nThis work improves the performance of deep learning by adopting network structure-independent methods without increasing the number of network parameters or computational complexity to achieve fast and accurate measurement. The proposed approach involves several techniques to improve the performance of neural network models; it utilizes offline diffusion model augmentation, online complex-valued data augmentation techniques, knowledge distillation, and an amplitude-phase decoupled loss function. The first two modules are utilized for data augmentation to prevent overfitting and unleash the potential of the model. The knowledge distillation module enables a smaller model to learn capabilities several times greater than its parameter capacity. The decoupled loss function separates amplitude and phase differences, allowing the model to adjust weights and focus on the image phase. Based on these training strategies, the cascade net (CasNet)[23], complex valued U-Net (CUNet)[24], shift window transformer for MRI (SwinMR)[19, 25, 26], real valued U-Net (RUNet)[27] and U-Net with residual block (ResUNet) were involved in this deep learning method to improve the speed of MR temperature measurements."}, {"title": "2 Theories", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 MR Reconstruction via Deep Learning", "content": "The speed of MRI is determined by the number of sampled k-space lines for a regular gradient echo sequence, and the acceleration can be achieved through reducing phase encoding numbers.

PRF shift thermometry shows a persistent linear correlation with temperature and is largely tissue-type agnostic (excluding adipose tissue), while providing a simple and robust real-time measurement method through the regular sequences. To determine temperature changes it calculates the phase difference between the magnetic resonance images with heating and the baseline images.

Furthermore, the cascade net, complex net, swin-transformer, real-unet, and resunet were used in the training to get five different reconstruction models. The decoupling loss function was modified to adapt complex-valued MR images used for temperature measurements.

As demonstrated by Trabucco Brandon et al, the diffusion model is a more effective means of generating diverse and realistic images[29]. Therefore, the diffusion model called Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)[30] was utilized here to generate a substantial amount of similar data for our training process. Additionally, we set the time step to 600 and increased the amount of data by a factor of five for the phantom and ex vivo sub-datasets, respectively. Since the diffusion model requires a considerable amount of time for processing, we opted for an offline method to generate augmented data before the training phase."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Online Complex Augmentations", "content": "Before inputting data into the model, we perform conventional data augmentation, which involves random cropping, flipping, rotation (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0), and Gaussian blurring. We would like to high-light that we extended real-valued data augmentation to complex-valued data by separately augmenting the magnitude and phase of complex images before combining them. This approach significantly increases data diversity by orders of squares, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalizability. To avoid introducing undesirable bias into the model training due to the disruption of spatial consistency between magnitude and phase, we apply complex-valued data augmentation with a specific probability. We set the optimal probability for triggering complex-valued data augmentation to 0.3."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Base Models", "content": "To achieve faster temperature map reconstruction, we implemented our proposed method on the Naive-Real-UNet (RUNet) and ResUNet, which has state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and is lightweight, making it an ideal choice for MR temperature map reconstruction.

We also compared our method with several SOTA MR reconstruction methods, such as the cascade network with data consistency (CasNet) [23], complex-valued convolutional network with UNet structure (CUNet)[24, 31], Swin-Transformer (SwinMR)[19], and the RUNet and ResUNet without any structure modifications."}, {"title": "3.1.4 Knowledge Distillation", "content": "Knowledge distillation[32] is a technique that can accelerate inference times by transferring the knowledge learned by a larger and more complex model to a smaller and simpler one while preserving or even improving performance[33, 34]. Larger models usually exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, but their inference speeds may be lower. Thus, the knowledge acquired by the larger \u201cteacher\u201d model network is transferred to the smaller \u201cstudent\" model in the form of soft labels. Initially, we pre-train a teacher model with an identical structure to that of the student model and extend the channels by a factor of four using both online and offline augmentation techniques. To ensure comprehensive training of the teacher network, we adopt a two-step approach. We perform pre-training on the FastMRI dataset, followed by full parameter fine-tuning on our research dataset. During each forward pass of student model, the output is compared to both the ground truth and the soft labels generated by the pre-trained teacher model. The losses are then weighted and calculated accordingly. The weights are dynamically adjusted to decay over time during training so that the student model can primarily learn from the teacher network in the initial stages and gradually transition to learning from the ground truth. The loss function for knowledge distillation is:\n\\(L_{total} = (1 - w) \u00b7 L_{gt} + w \u00b7 L_{soft},\\)\nwhere \\(w = (1 - \\frac{E_{curr}}{E_{total}})\\)\nwhere \\(l_{gt}\\) and \\(l_{soft}\\) denote the loss values calculated with the ground truth and the soft labels generated by the teacher network, respectively; \\(E_{curr}\\) and \\(E_{total}\\) denote the current epoch and the total number of epochs, respectively; y is the only hyperparameter that adjusts the weight of the teacher network guidance."}, {"title": "3.1.5 Decoupled Loss", "content": "Our investigation revealed that most reconstruction algorithms rely on the L1 loss function[35, 36] which may not be optimal for temperature measurement tasks that emphasize phases. More specifically, the L1 loss function tends to couple the magnitude and phase, resulting in identical loss values that correspond to different phases. Consequently, it becomes challenging to specifically optimize the phase component.\nTherefore, we attempted to decouple the loss function, as illustrated in Figure 2. We partitioned the loss into two components: magnitude loss (computed as the absolute error of the amplitude values) and phase loss (computed as the error in radians), with the former quantifying the difference in magnitude and the latter quantifying the phase difference.\nIn contrast to the decoupled loss functions proposed by Zhang et al.[37] and other researchers, our decoupled loss function is simpler and has a more straightforward geometric interpretation:\n\\(loss_{dc} = d + a l = ||\\hat{y}| - |y|| + a\u00b7 |\\hat{y}| \u00b7 A(\\hat{y} \u00d7 \\tilde{y})\\)\nwhere A represents the angle calculation function and a is a parameter that controls the degree of bias applied to the phase loss. The variables y,\u0177, and y represent the predicted complex output, ground truth, and the complex conjugate of y, respectively. In some other fields related to phase maps, different types of specialized phase loss functions are used[37, 38], but the rationale for their design and mathematical basis are not provided."}, {"title": "3.2 Heating Experiments and Implementation", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2.1 FUS heating", "content": "Our dataset was acquired through the application of a 128-element high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer (with a frequency of 1.1MHz, a focal length of 150mm, and a focal radius of 120mm), followed by imaging with a 3T MR system (Discovery MR750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). The images were obtained using the Fast Spoiled Gradient Echo (FSPGR) sequence, with 96 phase encoding steps, a TR/TE of 12/1.6ms, a flip angle of 30\u00b0, a slice thickness of 3mm, a field of view (FOV) of 28 \u00d7 28cm\u00b2, a Number of Excitation (NEX) of 1, and a bandwidth of \u00b162.5kHz.

For each part, there are 96 heating samples (consisting of 2186 slices) and 105 samples (consisting of 1623 slices), respectively, with each sample containing either one or three layers. The temperature change at the focus was approximately 30 degrees Celsius, and the focus position was consistently located at the center of the image. To enhance the speed of temperature measurement, we employed a smaller TR and fewer phase encoding steps, which led to a lower signal-to-noise ratio and resolution of the acquired images. This underscores the significance of utilizing fast temperature measurement algorithms to compensate for the reduced image quality."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Model Metrics", "content": "Temperature Metrics. After deriving the PRF temperature map from the complex images generated by the model and the reference images, we obtain a common metric that characterizes the reconstruction error of the entire image by calculating the average pixel-wise error compared to the original temperature map (represented as Terr). However, as we use the HIFU device to focus heat on a very small area, only a small region undergoes significant temperature changes. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider local metrics for the heating focus.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the temperature using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), standard deviation (STD), and Dice coefficient (DICE). These metrics are calculated within a pixel block that is cropped around the focal area, covering one-fourth of the width and height of the image. Furthermore, we also assess the agreement between the reconstructed temperature values and the reference values using Bland-Altman analysis and examine the linear relationship between these two sets of values using linear regression analysis, both of which are commonly used in previous related works[10]. The temperature map is calculated from the phase difference, and noise can be present in areas with very low signal intensity. To ensure accurate evaluation of the temperature image, a mask is applied before calculating temperature metrics.\nComputation Quantity Metrics. We evaluate the efficiency of the models by computing their Floating-point Opera-tions per Second (FLOPs), number of parameters (Params), CPU inference time (CPU-T), and effective acceleration ratio (E_{N=n}) at a certain undersampling rate, which is calculated using formula 5. It is worth noticing that we place greater emphasis on the effective acceleration ratio, as it can intuitively reflect the acceleration ratio that the model can achieve while considering the model inference time. By combining it with the model's performance for comparison, we can more effectively assess the cost-effectiveness of each model. Additionally, we estimated the total acquisition time (Cost-N\u00d7) for magnetic resonance imaging using the T_{TR}\u00b7 num_{pe}/N+ CPU-T formula.

Previously, the fast readout patterns have been studied for temperature measurements, such as spiral and radial strategies, EPI sequence[6, 7, 8]. The deep learning-based rapid reconstruction here was appropriate for them. In the case of under-sampling, these sequences can achieve a higher temporal resolution, combining our proposed methods. Theoretically, our approach can be applied by retraining whenever the acceleration is realized via undersampling. Specifically, we focus on enhancing the effective acceleration rate and improving model performance within a short inference time. To achieve this, we propose a series of model-agnostic techniques and validate the effectiveness of each module through experimental verification. The assembly of under-sampling and deep learning reconstruction for fast temperature measurements has quite a few benefits. For example, Undersampling means fewer phase encoding and less B0 field drift[39]. Without considering the loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the measured temperature should be more accurate. On the subject of motion-induced artifacts, our proposed deep-learning reconstruction module can also be improved to make it insensitive to respiration and other movement by modifying the neural network module. Once the fast thermometry can be realized, the volumetric temperature monitoring covering the whole focal area will be easier.\nIn our experiments, we employed only a maximum undersampling rate of 4\u00d7, instead of the up to 10x rate used by fastMRI. This choice was influenced by the limitations of the image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in our acquired images. The number of phase encodings in k-space was also relatively low, and the signal was not highly concentrated at the center. These factors resulted in significant signal loss when using excessively high undersampling rates, making reconstruction difficult. Interestingly, the compromised resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in the acquired dataset are flaws due to equipment design, which prioritized faster temperature mapping at the expense of spatial resolution; this highlights the importance of rapid thermometry. With the same temperature mapping speed, higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved, leading to higher-quality images. Consequently, these higher-quality images can then be subjected to higher undersampling rates.\nTo address this, we conducted an experiment using a phantom dataset and performed interpolation to simulate the acquisition of high-resolution images. Subsequently, we applied undersampling rates of 6\u00d7, 8\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 to these images and compared the results with those obtained from the original resolution images. The obtained RMSE values for the temperature map patches were 0.610\u00b0C, 0.704\u00b0C, and 0.724\u00b0C, respectively. These values closely align with the results obtained for 2x and 4\u00d7 resolutions in a 96 \u00d7 96 format.\nFurthermore, our study only utilized phantom and ex vivo tissue datasets. The temperature distribution in actual human tissue is more complex. Therefore, in the future, we plan to conduct testing and research on live animal models and specific human tissue datasets to further investigate and validate our findings."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents the first formal investigation into the application of deep learning methods for magnetic resonance temperature measurement.

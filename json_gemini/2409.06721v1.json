This study explored middle school students' perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver.

Introduction", "content": "The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has motivated educators to appropriate them for educational activities. Among those efforts are teachable agents (TAs). TA is a type of pedagogical agent that instantiates the pedagogical method of \u201clearning-by-teaching\" (Chase et al., 2009). Pedagogical agents often take the role of an experienced tutor (Heffernan & Koedinger, 2002) or a knowledgeable learning companion (Kim, 2007), and are purposely designed to arouse students' proactiveness in learning authentically by promoting self-exploration or self-discovery (Biswas et al., 2005). On the other hand, TA features simulating a less-knowledgeable peer to make the students teach them about learning content, through which the process students can learn, reinforce the conceptions or correct their misconceptions (Zhao et al., 2012). Extensive research has demonstrated the advantages of TAs regarding learning achievements and affective domains. For instance, TAs provide students with an opportunity to reorganize their knowledge structure and gain a deeper understanding of domain knowledge (Fantuzzo et al., 1992), enhance metacognition and self-explanation (Roscoe & Chi, 2007), and promote taking responsibility for learning (Chase et al., 2009). Several studies show that lower-achieving students benefit from interacting with a TA, which can help reduce the achievement gap (Chase et al., 2009).\nAlthough discussions have highlighted the benefits of TAs, many challenges still hinder the design of pedagogically meaningful, proactive interactions between TAs and students. These challenges include how TAs learn from students to personalize their learning experiences; how TAs can facilitate learning to be cognitively stimulating; how to design effective scaffolding to guide students' higher-order thinking; and how students and TAs can establish relationships that promote students' sense of ownership and agency in their learning (Silvervarg et al., 2021). GenAI technologies offer the potential to address these limitations by enabling more dynamic and naturalistic conversations, offering personalized and contextualized responses, and adapting to individual learning styles (Johnson & Lester, 2018). However, despite these potentials, researchers have raised concerns about GenAI that it can undermine students' creativity or originality, especially for younger children (Dai et.al, 2023). In addition, the adoption or acceptance of GenAI-powered learning technologies can largely depend on students' perceptions, such as trust (Amoozadeh et al., 2023).\nTo address such limitations, researchers have indicated the need to incorporate students' perspectives in designing educational GenAI applications and TAs to comprehensively understand student needs in such learning"}, {"title": "II. Literature review", "content": "Teachable agents (TAs) are the virtual agent that simulates a less knowledgeable peer to promote students' actions of learning-by-teaching (Zhao et al., 20121). Learning-by-teaching is a theory-based pedagogical practice in which students learn by teaching others (Frager & Stern, 1970). Rooted in Social Constructivism, learning-by-teaching emphasizes the social interaction of learning and the use of language within interactions (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978). TAs are reported to have an impact on enhancing students' domain knowledge (Fantuzzo et al., 1992), self-efficacy (Pareto et al., 2011), learning engagement, and motivation (Chase et al., 2009).\nThe history of TAs has been developing with the application of intelligent systems in education. For example, as an early type of TA in the early 1990s, DENISE (Development of Environment for an Intelligent Student in Economics) was presented by Nicolas (1993). DENISE used the early technology of AI to provide a personalized conversational agent mimicking a peer student in the context of Economics education. More recently, the TA has been advancing its functions and performances with the development of AI technologies, combining with pedagogical strategies like concept maps. For example, the use of AI-powered TA in classrooms enhanced elementary school students' science learning by not only reinforcing basic curriculum knowledge but also preparing them for future learning through interactive teaching and feedback (Chin et al., 2010). Similarly, Biswas and colleagues (2005) created Betty's Brain featuring the visualization of concept maps in a science subject, and Chase and colleagues (2009) utilized it in a middle school biology class.\nThe recent advancement of GenAI has transformed the field of education and TAs. GenAI is the technology that can generate new content in various modalities, such as text, images, and videos (Abunaseer, 2023). Using GenAI applications in educational settings is becoming a new trend of technology-enhanced learning (Dehouche, 2021; Malik et al., 2023). GenAI technology provides highly natural, human-like conversations that are contextual, personalized, and nuanced (Chan & Hu, 2023; Matthew et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024a). Due to such features and advantages, GenAI has been utilized in education in various forms, such as GenAI-supported writing (Kim et al., 2024), drawing in collaboration with GenAI (Kim & Cho, 2023), or GenAI-powered tutoring system (Soudi et al., 2024). Such applications of GenAI have been reported to have positive impacts on students, such as enhancing domain knowledge (Soudi et al., 2024), improving accessibility to learning activities and technologies (Jang et al., 2024), and promoting students' interpersonal and social abilities (Akdilek et al., 2024).\nGenAI technologies are expected to benefit TAs as well. Modern GenAI-powered TAs could generate more dynamic responses, offer personalized feedback, and adapt to individual learning styles (Johnson & Lester, 2018). Integrating large language models (LLMs) allows TAs to understand and respond to student input effectively and naturally (Jin et al., 2024). A recent review shows modern TAs can enhance student involvement, scaffold learning, and promote self-regulated learning (Baranwal, 2022). GenAI-powered TAs can adapt to different learning styles, paces, and preferences by presenting material suited to those needs (Lee & Lim, 2023). This personalization provides students with tailored support, increasing their involvement and engagement in learning (Apoki et al., 2022). TAs also facilitate self-regulated learning by engaging students in the active teaching of the agent, which leads students to organize, monitor, and assess their own learning progress (Silvervarg et al., 2021).\nDespite the anticipated benefits of Generative AI (GenAI) in enhancing teaching assistants (TAs), several challenges persist regarding its application. While scholars have highlighted the potential of GenAI-based learning,"}, {"title": "2.2. Roles of Teachable Agent", "content": "Research has indicated that TAs can serve diverse roles to support students' learning. First, TAs facilitate active learning by encouraging students to engage with the material through teaching (Baranwal, 2022). This approach is designed to cater to individual learning differences, fostering cognition and motivation and allowing students to be more involved in their learning process (Lim et al., 2005). For example, the TA in Magical Garden motivated preschool children to engage with early math concepts. By interacting with the TA, children were not just passive recipients of information but active participants in the learning process (Gulz et al., 2020).\nAdditionally, when TAs exhibit socially supportive behaviors, they induce the perception of a life-like social interaction partner by leveraging their ability to provide non-verbal and emotional feedback, positively impacting students' performance (Saerbeck et al., 2010). A study on the design of TAs and feedback mechanisms in educational software found that students who used a mathematics game with a social conversation module reported a more positive experience with the game, demonstrated greater learning gains, and self-reported feeling that they taught the TA more effectively (T\u00e4rning, 2018).\nFurthermore, TAs could be personalized learning assistants by providing personalized support. Lee and Lim (2023) developed a TA to aid language learning, providing personalized teaching based on students' conversations and skill evaluations. These learning experiences are facilitated by students customizing the TA's knowledge state and fine-tuning its learning behaviors, including the frequency of questions, to optimize their own learning process (Jin et al., 2024). While research has discussed the potential roles of TAs, there has been little research that reports student perspectives on TA roles."}, {"title": "2.3. Opportunities and Challenges of Learning with TA", "content": "Employing TAs in learning presents opportunities and challenges. Earlier versions of TAs manifested as avatars, embodying traits of learning companions and pedagogical agents (Kim & Baylor, 2008). For instance, AgentSheets allows students to create their own agents and simulations to foster computational thinking (Bilotta et al., 2009). Additionally, Betty's Brain, as mentioned above, engaged students in constructing and refining a concept map, which helps students understand the subject matter and develop metacognitive skills (Biswas et al., 2016).\nDespite their educational potential, implementing TAs in classrooms faces challenges. Technical challenges include the complexities of creating GenAI-powered TAs that can learn from and adapt to student needs, abilities, and interests (Crompton et al., 2022). In the study conducted by Matsuda and colleagues (2020), the TA was designed to allow students to demonstrate and instruct the learning process. However, it was found that the TA could not fully comprehend students' open-ended responses. This limits communication between students and the TA and, in turn, limits meaningful learning for both the student and the TA.\nMeanwhile, developing relevant pedagogical models and/or instructional strategies to support TA-assisted instruction is challenging. As many argue that pedagogically poor AI cannot lead to significant learning gains, it is imperative to consider various pedagogical approaches (e.g., active learning, critical thinking, and collaboration) underpinning TAs (Chan & Tsi, 2023). This directs the design of TAs to focus on systematic instructional design to support meaningful learning (Kim, 2024).\nAdditionally, fostering relationships between students and TAs is crucial for enhancing students' sense of ownership and agency in learning, making their educational experience more effective and self-directed. As highlighted in previous studies (Silvervarg et al., 2021; Kim & Cho, 2023), addressing these challenges is crucial for successfully integrating TAs in educational settings. The review of existing literature provides insights into the diverse roles of TAs, opportunities, and challenges encountered in effectively implementing TAs into educational practices. However, less is known about how GenAI can create synergetic values or introduce new challenges in TAs. Students' perceptions on this topic are highly valued since they can direct future development and utilization of GenAI-powered TAs in classrooms."}, {"title": "III. Methods", "content": "Our research team developed a GenAI-powered TA for secondary school math learning called [ANONYMOUS]. Theoretically grounded on learning-by-teaching principles, our technology design adopted other instructional strategies, such as personalized learning, contrast cases, gamification, and psychological interventions. Figure 1 showcases the interface design of our TA with annotations for major features. Personalized learning is realized by letting students choose their levels and themes (Fig. 1 (a)). Contrasting cases let students compare exemplary and flawed cases and understand the major differences between them (Schwartz et al., 2011), as demonstrated by the conversation between students and the AI agent (Fig. 1 (b): \u201cHere are my thoughts. Which can be fixed?\").\nGamification was integrated into the top right corner of the interface through the accumulated points and leaderboard (Sailer & Hommer, 2020) (Fig. 1 (c)). Lastly, students' psychological processes, such as perception and attitudes, were incorporated to motivate learning, such as providing an authentic persona of the virtual peer that students are helping (Yeager & Walton, 2011) (Fig. 1 (d)).\nLarge language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT-4-Turbo, were the essential GenAI component in our system to develop a TA that simulates human-like conversations as a middle school student struggling with mathematics. While there is no agreed-upon optimal temperature for TAs, we adopted a setting of 0.6, guided by OpenAI's case for open-ended responses in their technical report (Achiam et al., 2023). We hypothesized that this moderate temperature would produce responses that are varied and original, yet still highly coherent and pertinent. To model inquiries from students in need of help during math learning for the TA, we developed a knowledge graph from over 3.5 million authentic math Q&A entries sourced from Math Nation (https://www.mathnation.com/), a digital learning platform dedicated to K-12 math education. These Q&As originated from interactions between middle and high school students and professionally trained tutors, tasked with facilitating the students' queries.\""}, {"title": "3.2. Research Participants", "content": "This study adopted a purposeful sampling to examine diverse views of middle school students about the perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. A cohort of 108 6th-grade students from six classes attending a public laboratory research middle school affiliated with a Research 1 University located in the Southeastern United States participated in this study. This school was chosen because the student population reflects the demographics of the school-age population in the state. The students belonged to two math teachers' classes: a White female teacher with 25 years of teaching math, and a Black male teacher with 15 years of teaching math. The demographic breakdowns of the students included 50 boys, 51 girls, and seven identifying as others, with a racial composition of 29 Black/African American, 56 White, 15 Hispanic, five Asian, and three others. English was the first language for 94 students and the second language for 14 students. Eighty-two students reported their primary language spoken at home as English, four as Spanish, and 22 as multiple languages. This study received ethical approval from the [author's institute]'s Institutional Review Board (IRB NO. 202301838) and informed consent from all participants."}, {"title": "3.3. Study Context", "content": "We conducted a classroom study to allow the 6th-grade students to learn math content related to the unit they were learning (i.e., rate and ratio) by interacting with [ANONYMOUS]. Figure 2 illustrates students learning with the [ANOMYMOUS] platform in the classroom. The classroom study involved a total of two class periods, each lasting 47-50 minutes. The first session started with an introduction of the research team and the research project, along with the assent process. The first session also allowed researchers to provide a brief introduction to the concepts of GenAI and TA to naturally lead to the introduction of our learning technology, [ANONYMOUS]. After the introduction, students were provided access to [ANONYMOUS], followed the guided tutorial embedded in the system, interacted with the TA without pressure to solve the problem, and then finally started solving the problems with the TA seriously.\nWe included eight problems in the platform within the unit of rates and ratio, which the students had finished learning at the time of our intervention (6th-grade Algebra standard). The problems were initially generated by AI and reviewed and revised by three human content experts holding Ph.D. degrees in Mathematics education. They were provided with four criteria: 1) whether the content aligns with the standards, 2) whether the numbers in the problem, answers, explanations, topic, and difficulty levels are accurate, 3) whether the writing is readable for middle school students, and 4) whether the language and contents are safe and unbiased. Students continuously engaged in solving the problems with the TA in the following session and most students finished all eight problems despite a variation between six to eight problems. At the end of the second session, students were asked to fill out the open-ended survey questionnaire, of which the details will be described in the following subsection."}, {"title": "3.4. Data Collection", "content": "To answer our RQs, we collected qualitative data from three data sources during and after the classroom study: observation, semi-structured focus-group interviews, and responses to open-ended survey questions. First, qualitative observations were conducted to collect data from the natural classroom setting. Four graduate researchers and two teachers attended the learning sessions and took field notes. Since two classes happened simultaneously, each session had two graduate researchers and one teacher overseeing the class. The two graduate researchers in each classroom worked as facilitators and observers, taking notes about students' common questions regarding the TA, their interactions with and reactions to the TA, and their struggles while using the TA.\nThe graduate researchers, along with the teachers, undertook the roles of facilitators in the classroom intervention, answering questions regarding the use of technology, content knowledge (math concepts), and the study process (surveys). While students interacted with the TA, they asked questions about terminologies they were not familiar with (e.g., what is \"consecutive\"?), asked for troubleshooting of the technologies (e.g., internet connection), or requested help for pedagogical skills (e.g., \u201chow can I explain this concept to the AI?\"). After the classroom experience, we conducted a Qualtrics-administered questionnaire to collect students' responses to open-ended questions, including \u201cWhat did you like about [ANONYMOUS]?\u201d, \u201cWhat did NOT you like about [ANONYMOUS]?\u201d and \u201cHow can we improve it?\u201d.\nA subset of students was invited to participate in semi-structured focus-group interviews with guiding questions to complement the collected open-ended survey responses and learn more about diverse students' perceptions. To select interviewees, researchers and teachers discussed whom to invite for the interviews. The final participants for the interview were selected among the students who were especially engaged in the class with the TA, possessed good communication skills, and were of diverse demographic groups (e.g., gender, race). In total, 14 students participated in the interviews, yielding three groups of 4 to 6 students. Each group was led by a different researcher while other researchers were present, taking notes and adding follow-up questions. The interview protocol was prepared before the interviews and included questions on students' experiences with the TA, roles they expected for the TA, advantages and challenges of learning with the TA, and areas for further improvement. The interview protocol and the guiding questions were developed by the graduate researchers based on the previous literature (e.g., Kim et al., 2024) and reviewed by the faculty members (see Appendix A for the interview questions).\""}, {"title": "3.5. Data Analysis", "content": "We adopted thematic analysis to analyze data corresponding to our research aims and the data types collected. Thematic analysis is useful in exploratory research for identifying, describing, and interpreting participants' experiences in relation to an issue and current practices (Braun et al., 2016). As stated in the previous section, we collected three distinct types of qualitative data to ensure data diversity and in-depth analyses. Thematic analysis is a widely utilized method for organizing and interpreting qualitative data and can be applied to various data sources including focus groups and open-ended questionnaire responses, among others (Howitt, 2019).\nWe chose a mixed approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis (Smith, 2015). Two researchers first conducted deductive analysis independently, mainly reviewing each qualitative data source, examining students' utterances and taking notes of initial ideas or descriptions to capture important insights by applying their knowledge of existing literature and theories and their experience of AIED. Following this, two researchers conducted an inductive analysis, listing the potential codes based on the annotated memo. In this step, we used open coding to make the initial concepts from the data and shared them through Google Spreadsheets. Then, two researchers reviewed those codes and clarified the meaning of codes with exemplary quotes. After that, researchers conducted axial coding to make connections between codes and refined concepts (Braun et al., 2016). . These were then combined into 23 potential overarching themes. The entire data set was once again thoroughly reviewed, which has been administered through a similar process during the initial coding, to uncover and develop any new emerging"}, {"title": "IV. Findings & Discussion", "content": "Students perceived TAs as learning companions, infusing subjective characteristics. First, students considered TAs as academically weak peers who are less skilled with lower levels of knowledge. In turn, students occupied the role of tutor, helping the TA to improve math performance by providing advice, support, and knowledge. Second, students approached the TA as a peer they could socialize with, making their learning more exciting and enriching. Students perceived the TA's personalized and real-time feedback as a mechanism that strengthened their rapport with the TA, promoting active learning (Baranwal, 2022). Third, students perceived the TA as a peer with different abilities. As P3's quotation illustrated in Table 1, students acknowledge the differences between AI and human intelligence and how AI learns differently from humans. They compared such differences with their classroom learning and described that each classmate possesses unique strengths and weaknesses that differentiate one person from another. They anticipated that such differences between students and AI would foster a learning environment that is more diverse and engaging.\nAnother perceived role of TAs was as a learning facilitator, helping students grasp learning content and streamline learning processes. For instance, a TA asked questions to monitor their problem-solving process (\u201cThis AI kept asking me how I came to this answer, \u201d P6) and constantly asked them what to do (\u201cIt continuously asked me what to do next,\" P3), encouraging them to delve deeper into their thoughts to get more out of the learning content. It is an interesting finding that students not only saw the TA as a less knowledgeable peer (Zhao et al., 2012) but also saw them as someone who could help with their learning. This could stem from students' belief that AI should be smart\nStudents considered TAs to be collaborative problem-solvers who effectively solved the math problems at hand. Students involved the TA in the sequence of steps to solve the math problem together, as demonstrated by the creative problem-solving process (CPS) model. This model includes defining the problem accurately, generating possible solutions, assessing the solutions to the problem, making selections among them, and applying the selected ideas with the TA (Kim et al., 2024). TAs seem to be viewed by students as collaborative problem-solvers rather than computer programs simulating a student (\u201cSometimes when I was stuck, AI gave me some hints and we could solve the problem together,\" P10)."}, {"title": "4.2. Students' perceived advantages of learning with GenAI-powered TA", "content": "Students illustrated that learning with the TA creates a student-centered learning climate. First, students appreciated that the TA promotes diverse pedagogical approaches, such as problem-based learning (\u201cI solved ten problems with the AI,\" P5), scenario-based learning (\u201cI liked how it was real-life scenarios,\" P6), gamification (\u201cIt gives me points and I wanted to get to the top (on the leaderboard), so it made me want to try harder,\u201d P8), and mission-based learning (\"We complete one mission and move to the next one,\u201d P5). Despite the known educational effects of such an interactive and student-centered instructional approach (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978), creating and implementing them has been challenging. Constructivist pedagogies, which often incorporate self-guided learning, hold the risk of students developing misconceptions without teachers' adequate and timely intervention, which is often challenging in classrooms (Krahenbuhl, 2016). In this regard, TAs hold the potential to provide student-centered learning environments through individualized and timely feedback and guidance that redirect students from developing misconceptions while allowing them to construct knowledge in an expert's role.\nFurthermore, students perceived that learning with a GenAI-powered TA fosters their' autonomy. As students take on the role of a tutor, they exhibit a sense of responsibility and are likely to take ownership of their learning (Chase et al., 2009). Compared to traditional math classes, where teachers give a lecture and instructions for completing a task, students take more active roles in their learning (\u201cLearning is much more dynamic when I am on"}, {"title": "4.3. Students' perceived barriers to learning with GenAI-powered TA", "content": "First, the most pressing challenge was found to be the TA's lack of problem presentation skills. (\u201cIt's not something I didn't try to help out. But it didn't fully explain to me what made it not understand,\" P14). Students did not perceive the TA's low performance (i.e., wrong answers and lower knowledge level) as a critical issue but instead highlighted the necessity of clearly communicating and addressing the problem in detail so that students could guide the TA appropriately. The texts generated by AI should be examined for clarity and readability before being presented to students.\nSecond, the TA's surface-level questions were perceived as another challenge. Students expected the GenAI TA to ask complex questions to articulate thoughts, comprehensively explore the subject matter, and reinforce learning. Since questions could be classified into several taxonomies (Bloom & Krathwohl, 2020), students expressed preference for higher-order questions that require critical thinking rather than mere memorization.\nThird, students pointed out the TAs inability to accommodate different learning styles as a barrier, and shared their preferred modes of instruction. For example, some prefer visual instruction (\u201cI learn better in pictures,\u201d P11), while others prefer verbal instruction (\u201cI need someone to explain it for me,\u201d P14). Students expected AI to understand their learning styles and provide personalized interaction to suit their needs. This suggests the need for multiple ways to represent and communicate knowledge between students and AI (CAST, 2018).\nThe fourth barrier was the learning sequence of math problems, which the TA presented randomly and was inadequate for learning. Other Al technologies, such as AI-based recommendation systems, could be integrated into the GenAI-powered TA to provide a deliberately designed learning sequence.\nLastly, students pointed out that the TA's social-emotional skills could be improved. Students wanted to build rapport and develop a relationship with the AI characters by using similar languages (e.g., \u201ckid languages or slang,\" P6) and making jokes with them (e.g., \u201cI wanted to play with the TA but the TA ignored and said 'let's talk about math,\" P16). Despite a common concern that social interactions or off-task conversations distract from learning, promoting social-emotional interaction with agents could enhance learning experiences, thereby improving\""}, {"title": "V.

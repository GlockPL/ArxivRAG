INTRODUCTION", "content": "The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for document processing tasks has significantly accelerated the automation of various domains, including legal, financial, and administrative workflows. Document AI models are tasked with interpreting complex documents, performing tasks such as document classification, named entity recognition (NER), and information extraction. However, the performance of these models is largely dependent on the availability of large, well labeled datasets, which are often scarce, expensive, and fraught with privacy concerns. For instance, obtaining datasets for sensitive domains such as legal contracts, financial records, or medical documentation is particularly challenging due to strict privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Real-world document datasets are not only limited in quantity but also diverse in structure. Documents can vary significantly in their layout, with elements such as text blocks, images, tables, and headings arranged in complex spatial patterns. Traditional data augmentation techniques that focus on text modifications, such as synonym replacement or back-translation, fail to account for the spatial and structural relationships between these elements. Consequently, models trained solely on augmented text data may perform well on tasks that rely on content analysis but often struggle with tasks where layout information is crucial, such as document classification and object detection [1].\nAnother critical challenge in Document AI is the high cost of manual data annotation. Document datasets often require domain-specific annotations, such as identifying entities in legal contracts or extracting key financial terms from invoices. This annotation process is labor-intensive, making it infeasible to scale for large datasets. Moreover, even when datasets are available, they may not represent the diversity of document types encountered in real-world applications, leading to poor generalization in deployed models."}, {"title": "B. The Role of Synthetic Data Generation", "content": "In response to these challenges, synthetic data generation has gained traction as a solution to increase the availability of training data. Synthetic data refers to artificially generated data that mimics the characteristics of real-world data while offering several key advantages [2]. Firstly, synthetic data can be generated at scale, overcoming the issue of data scarcity. Secondly, it provides a means to address privacy concerns, as it does not contain real personal information, yet it preserves the statistical properties of the original data. Finally, synthetic data generation allows for the creation of diverse datasets that capture a wide range of document layouts and styles, enabling models to learn from edge cases and underrepresented document structures. Traditional methods for synthetic data generation have focused primarily on text augmentation and image manipulation. For example, synonym replacement, paraphrasing, and back-translation techniques have been used to enhance text datasets by introducing linguistic variations"}, {"title": "C. Graph-Based Layout Generation", "content": "A promising solution to the limitations of traditional synthetic data generation methods is the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for layout generation [3]. In this approach, documents are modeled as graphs, where each node 2 represents a document element, such as a text block, heading, image, or table, and edges capture the spatial relationships between these elements. This graph-based representation allows for the modeling of global dependencies between document elements, something that traditional data augmentation methods cannot achieve. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for generating synthetic document layouts because they consider both the local and global structural patterns of a document. Local patterns might involve the alignment of a paragraph with its corresponding heading, while global patterns could represent the hierarchical structure of a report, where the main title is followed by subsections and tables. By encoding these relationships, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can learn from existing document layouts and generate new layouts that are both diverse and structurally coherent. The use of Graph Neural Networks for layout generation offers several key advantages:\n\u2022 Structural Realism: GNNs can capture both local and global dependencies between document elements, resulting in layouts that closely resemble the structural complexity of real-world documents.\n\u2022 Semantic Consistency: By modeling relationships between different elements, GNNs ensure that the generated layouts remain semantically coherent. For example, a title will always be followed by relevant sections, and figures will be appropriately aligned with their captions.\n\u2022 Diversity: GNNs can generate a wide variety of layouts, incorporating both common and rare document structures. This is particularly useful for training models to handle edge cases or less common document formats that might otherwise be underrepresented in real-world datasets."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND ON SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION", "content": "Synthetic data generation has become a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of data scarcity, privacy, and the high cost of manual annotation in machine learning applications. Within Document AI, traditional synthetic data generation methods have primarily focused on text augmentation and image-based augmentations. These approaches seek to introduce variability into existing datasets by altering content or visual elements in ways that preserve the core semantics of the data. One of the most widely used text augmentation techniques is synonym replacement, where words in a document are substituted with synonyms while maintaining the overall meaning of the text. This approach helps to generate more linguistically diverse training examples, increasing the robustness of natural language processing (NLP) models. Other methods include paraphrasing, where entire sentences are restructured without altering their meaning, and backtranslation, a method that involves translating text into another language and then back to the original language. Backtranslation introduces subtle variations while ensuring that the semantic content of the text remains intact. While these text-based augmentation methods have proven effective in tasks such as text classification and entity recognition, they often fall short in document processing tasks that rely heavily on the document's layout and spatial organization. For example, in a financial document or legal contract, the arrangement of tables, headers, and text blocks can be critical to interpreting the document correctly. Traditional text augmentation methods ignore these layout details, limiting their effectiveness in enhancing the model's understanding of document structure. On the other hand, image-based augmentation techniques are designed to modify the visual properties of documents, such as font style, background texture, or image quality. Techniques like style transfer and image-to-image translation allow for the manipulation of visual features while keeping the overall document content the same. These methods have been used effectively to generate new document images with varying aesthetics and noise levels. In many cases, they are applied to scanned documents to simulate real-world imperfections, such as blurring, skew, or noise caused by poor scanning quality. These variations help improve the robustness of document recognition systems, particularly for tasks like optical character recognition (OCR). However, despite the benefits of these visual augmentation techniques, they fail to capture the complex spatial relationships between different elements of a document. For example, the position of a company logo relative to the header, or the alignment of a table with a paragraph, can convey important structural information. Simple image manipulations cannot model these relationships, making it difficult for document Al models to fully understand and generalize across different document types."}, {"title": "B. Traditional Methods of Synthetic Data Generation", "content": "In contrast to traditional augmentation methods, graph-based layout generation offers a more sophisticated approach by modeling the document layout as a graph. In this representation, document elements such as text blocks, images, tables, and headings are represented as nodes, while the spatial relationships between these elements such as alignment, proximity, and hierarchy are represented as edges. This graph- based approach allows for the modeling of global dependencies between document elements, something that traditional data augmentation methods cannot achieve.

This graph-based approach allows GNNs to capture both local dependencies (e.g., the spatial alignment between a title and its associated paragraph) and global structural patterns (e.g., the hierarchical structure of a report or an article). Unlike traditional grid-based approaches that rely on positional coordinates or fixed layouts, graph representations provide flexibility in modeling complex relationships between document components."}, {"title": "1) Nodes in the Document Graph", "content": "Each node in the document graph corresponds to a specific document element.

These features are essential for the GNN to learn the importance of different elements and how they relate to one another in terms of both layout and meaning."}, {"title": "2) Edges in the Document graph", "content": "Edges in the document graph represent the spatial relationships between nodes.

For example, a caption should always appear close to its corresponding image or figure, and headings should precede their associated content."}, {"title": "B. Graph Neural Networks for Layout Synthesis", "content": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are well-suited for tasks that involve modeling relationships between entities, making them an ideal choice for document layout generation. GNNs work by iteratively updating node representations based on the information propagated through neighboring nodes and edges, allowing the model to learn both local and global dependencies in the document graph."}, {"title": "1) Message Passing in GNNs", "content": "In GNNs, information is exchanged between nodes through a process called message passing [5]. At each iteration (or layer) of the GNN, each node sends and receives messages from its neighbors. These messages are used to update the node's internal representation, allowing the GNN to capture the influence of neighboring nodes and their spatial relationships [6]. Mathematically, the message-passing operation for a node vi in a graph can be expressed as:\n$h_i^{(l+1)} = \\sigma (\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} \\phi(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, e_{ij}))$\nWhere;\n\u2022 $h_i^{(l)}$ is the hidden state of node vi\n\u2022 $h_j^{(l)}$ is the hidden state of a neighbouring node vj\n\u2022 $e_{ij}$ represents the edge (relationship) between nodes v\u2081 and vj\n\u2022 \u03c3 is an activation function (e.g., ReLU)\n\u2022 $ \\phi $ is a message function that combines the features of the node and its neighbors.\nThrough multiple layers of message passing, the GNN gradually learns a richer representation of each node in the graph, incorporating information from both nearby and distant nodes. This allows the GNN to understand how different elements in a document are related to one another, even across long distances in the layout."}, {"title": "2) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)", "content": "To generate new document layouts, we can integrate GNNs with generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These models allow us to generate diverse document layouts by sampling from the learned distribution of real-world layouts.\n\u2022 VAEs operate by encoding an input graph (representing a document layout) [7], [8] into a latent space and then decoding it to generate new layouts. The VAE learns to represent the distribution of document layouts in the latent space, from which we can sample new layouts that retain the structural properties of real-world documents. The VAE loss function is typically composed of a reconstruction loss, which ensures that the generated layout is like the original, and a KL divergence term, which ensures that the latent space follows a normal distribution:\n$L_{VAE} = L_{Reconstruction} + \\beta D_{KL}(q(z|x)||p(z))$\nWhere (x) is the input layout, (z) is the latent variable, and \u03b2 controls the trade-off between reconstruction and regularization.\n\u2022 GANs are also used to generate document layouts by training two networks: a generator that creates synthetic layouts, and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and synthetic layouts. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator into classifying synthetic layouts as real, leading to increasingly realistic synthetic document layouts. The GAN loss function is typically formulated as:\n$L_{GAN} = E_{x~p_{data}}[logD(x)] + E_{z~p(z)}[log(1-D(G(z)))]$\nWhere D(x) is the discriminator's output for a real layout (x), and (G(z)) is the generator's output for a synthetic layout based on latent variable (z). Both VAEs and GANs benefit from the rich graph-based representations learned by GNNs, ensuring that the generated layouts maintain both structural coherence and visual diversity."}, {"title": "C. Advantages of Graph Augmentation for Layout Generation", "content": "Graph-based augmentation [9] techniques provide several advantages over traditional data augmentation methods for document layout generation:\n1) Structural Realis:\nGNNs capture both local and global dependencies between document elements, ensuring that generated layouts are structurally coherent and realistic.

For instance, important document components (e.g., titles, figures) are placed in appropriate positions, preserving the overall meaning of the document.\n3) Diversity\nGNNs allow for the generation of a wide variety of layouts, incorporating both common and rare document structures. This is particularly useful for training Document AI models on edge cases or underrepresented document formats. By learning from diverse document types (e.g., scientific papers, legal documents, financial reports), GNNs generate layouts that are representative of real-world variability.\n4) Generalisation\nModels trained on graph-augmented data generalize better to unseen, real-world layouts because they have been exposed to a richer and more structurally diverse training set.

Methodology", "content": "The core of our approach lies in transforming a document's layout into a graph representation and training a GNN to generate realistic document structures. The methodology consists of three primary stages: graph construction, GNN training, and synthetic layout generation. We also incorporate Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to ensure diversity in the generated layouts."}, {"title": "Graph Construction", "content": "The first step in our approach is to construct a graph representation of a document layout [13]. As discussed in Section 3, each document element (e.g., text blocks, tables, images) is represented as a node, and the spatial and semantic relationships between these elements are represented as edges. To formally define the graph:\n\u2022 Let (G = (V, E)) be the document layout graph, where (V) is the set of nodes representing document elements and (E) is the set of edges representing spatial relationships between elements.\n\u2022 Each node ve V is associated with a feature vector hv containing attributes such as the element type (e.g., text, image), size, position, and font properties (for text nodes).\n\u2022 Each edge eij E E represents the relationship between nodes vi and vj, capturing spatial relationships like alignment, proximity, and hierarchy.\nFor example, consider a document with a title, paragraph, and table. In the corresponding graph, the title and paragraph would be connected by an edge indicating their alignment and proximity, while the table would be connected to the paragraph based on their relative positioning within the document. This representation captures both the layout and the logical flow of the document, providing a comprehensive model for the GNN to learn from."}, {"title": "2) GNN Training", "content": "Once the graph representation of the document is constructed, we use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the underlying structural patterns and relationships in the layout. The GNN is trained on a dataset of real-world document layouts to learn both local and global dependencies between elements. During training, the GNN performs message passing between nodes, allowing each node to update its feature representation based on the information received from its neighbors. This iterative process enables the GNN to capture both direct and indirect relationships between document elements. Over multiple layers, the GNN learns how these relationships influence the overall layout, making it possible to generate new layouts that maintain structural coherence. The objective function during training is designed to minimize the reconstruction loss between the real-world layouts and the layouts generated by the GNN. In addition, a regularization term is used to ensure that the learned graph representations generalize well to unseen data. The overall loss function is expressed as:\n$L_{GNN} = L_{reconstruction} + \\lambda L_{regularization}$\nWhere;\n\u2022 $L_{reconstruction}$ ensures that the generated layout closely resembles the original layout.\n\u2022 $L_{regularization}$ prevents overfitting by promoting generalization to diverse layout structures.\n\u2022 \u03bb controls the balance between reconstruction accuracy and regularization."}, {"title": "3) Synthetic Layout Generation", "content": "Once trained, the GNN can be used to generate synthetic document layouts [2] by sampling from the learned graph representations. To enhance the diversity of the generated layouts, we integrate the GNN with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) framework.\na) VAE Integration\nThe VAE allows us to sample from a latent space that encodes the distribution of real-world document layouts. The VAE'S encoder maps a document graph to a latent representation ( z ), and the decoder reconstructs the layout graph from this latent space. The latent space enables us to generate novel layouts by sampling new values of (z) and decoding them into synthetic document graphs.\nb) GAN Integration\nThe GAN framework consists of a generator (the GNN) and a discriminator that evaluates whether the generated layout is real or synthetic. The generator is trained to produce layouts that fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and synthetic layouts. This adversarial training process ensures that the generated layouts are not only diverse but also realistic in terms of their structural and semantic properties. By combining GNNs with generative models, our approach generates a wide variety of document layouts that maintain structural realism and semantic consistency. The generated layouts can be used to augment existing training datasets, providing Document AI models with the structural diversity they need to generalize effectively to real-world tasks."}, {"title": "B.

Traditional approaches often struggle to generalize to different document formats, particularly when the dataset lacks structural diversity. By training models on synthetic layouts generated using GNNs, we can introduce a broader range of layout variations, enabling the model to learn from different document structures. This leads to improved generalization on unseen document types. For example, a model trained on real-world legal documents might struggle to classify scientific papers due to differences in structure (e.g., section headers, figures, and tables). By incorporating synthetic layouts that mimic both document types, the model learns to recognize structural cues from a broader range of formats, improving classification accuracy."}, {"title": "2) Named Entity Recognition (NER)", "content": "Named entity recognition (NER) is another task that benefits from graph-based synthetic layout generation [15]. In many documents, the position and context of entities (e.g., names, dates, organizations) are tied to the document's layout. For example, in financial documents, key entities may appear in tables or specific sections of a report. A model trained on synthetically generated layouts that simulate different positioning and contexts of entities is better equipped to handle real-world variations. By generating synthetic layouts that reflect the spatial and semantic relationships between entities and other document elements, we can improve the model's ability to detect and classify named entities in documents with varying structures."}, {"title": "3) Information Extraction Information", "content": "Extraction tasks, such as extracting tables, figures, or key data points from documents, also rely heavily on layout understanding. In structured documents like invoices, contracts, and reports, information is often presented in specific sections or aligned with labels. Our approach to generating synthetic layouts introduces diverse layout structures that better reflect the variability encountered in real-world documents. For example, in invoice processing, a model trained on synthetic layouts that vary in table placement, font styles, and section headings will be more adept at extracting information from a wide range of invoice formats. This leads to improved performance in real-world applications, where documents often deviate from standardized templates."}, {"title": "C. Addressing Challenges of Domain Adaptation", "content": "One of the key challenges in synthetic data generation is the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data. Even though synthetic layouts generated by GNNs are structurally realistic, there may still be subtle differences between synthetic and real documents, which can hinder model performance when applied to real-world tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose the following solutions:\n1) Domain Adaptation\nFine-tuning the model on a small set of real-world data can help bridge the domain gap. By pretraining the model on synthetic layouts and then fine-tuning it on real-world data, we can improve the model's ability to generalize across both synthetic and real domains.\n2) Data Augmentation with Real-World Layouts\nCombining synthetic layouts with a subset of real-world layouts during training helps the model learn from both data sources. This hybrid approach improves robustness by exposing the model to the nuances of real-world document structures.\n3) Pseudo-Labeling\nFor tasks where labeled real-world data is scarce, pseudo- labeling techniques can be used to leverage large amounts of unlabeled real-world data. By training on both synthetic data and pseudo-labeled real-world data, the model can gradually improve its performance on real-world tasks."}, {"title": "V.

CHALENGES AND LIMITATIONS", "content": "While the proposed graph-based synthetic layout generation approach demonstrates significant advantages over traditional data augmentation techniques, it also presents several challenges and limitations. These challenges must be addressed to ensure broader adoption and scalability in real-world applications."}, {"title": "A. Computational Complexity", "content": "One of the primary limitations of GNN-based layout generation is the computational cost. Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large datasets, especially when combined with generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is computationally intensive. GNNs require multiple layers of message passing between nodes, leading to higher memory consumption and increased processing time compared to traditional augmentation methods such as text-based or image- based techniques [3]. Additionally, generating synthetic layouts using GNNs is more resource-intensive than applying simple data augmentation methods like synonym replacement or image transformations. The computational complexity arises from both the graph representation of the document and the iterative message-passing steps required to capture local and global dependencies between elements. To mitigate these costs, we propose the following strategies:\n1) Model pruning and optimization\nTechniques such as model pruning and quantization can be applied to reduce the size of GNNs without significantly sacrificing performance. This helps to decrease the memory foot- print and computational load during both training and inference 5\u2020source.\n2) Distributed and parallel computing\nUtilizing distributed computing frameworks and parallel processing can help accelerate the training of GNNs on large document datasets. These techniques are particularly useful when scaling the model to handle datasets with millions of documents."}, {"title": "B. Quality Control in Synthetic Layouts", "content": "Ensuring that the generated layouts are both realistic and semantically meaningful is another challenge. While GNNs excel at capturing the structural relation- ships between document elements, the quality of the generated layouts depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the training data. Poor quality input layouts may lead to unrealistic or semantically inconsistent synthetic outputs, which can negatively impact model performance. Additionally, generated layouts might occasionally deviate from human understood design rules or conventions, especially when edge cases are synthesized. For example, certain types of documents, such as legal contracts, have strict formatting and structure, and deviations from these formats may reduce the utility of synthetic layouts for training models in those domains. To address these challenges, we propose:\n1) Human-in-the-loop validation\nIncorporating human feedback in the layout generation pipeline allows for iterative refinement of the generated layouts. Human validators can review and correct synthetic layouts to ensure that they adhere to design rules and semantic coherence 5\u2020source.\n2) Post-generation layout validation\nAutomated rules and heuristics can be applied to validate generated layouts, ensuring that they meet predefined constraints before being added to the training dataset. For instance, rules ensuring that titles are always followed by paragraphs or that figures are correctly aligned with captions can be encoded to maintain layout consistency."}, {"title": "C. Domain Adaptation", "content": "Another limitation is the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data. Although GNN-based layouts are structurally realistic, they may not fully cap-ture the nuanced layout variations encountered in specific domains, such as medical records, legal contracts, or scientific reports. When models are trained on synthetic data alone, they may fail to generalize well to unseen real-world documents that contain subtle domain specific structures. This limitation can be addressed through domain adaptation techniques:\nFine-tuning with real-world data\nAfter pre-training models on syn- thetic layouts, fine-tuning them with a small set of real-world data from the target domain can help bridge the gap. This hybrid approach im- proves generalization by enabling the model to learn from both synthetic and real-world layouts.\n2) Transfer learning\nTransfer learning techniques can be employed to transfer knowledge learned from one domain (e.g., financial documents) to another (e.g., legal documents). This approach leverages shared structural similarities between document types to improve model performance across multiple domains."}, {"title": "VII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "While our graph-based approach to synthetic document layout generation has shown promising results, there are several avenues for future research and improvement\nA. Scalability and Efficiency Improvements\nAs mentioned in Section 6, the computational complexity of GNNs is a significant challenge. Future research could focus on improving the scalability of GNN-based layout generation by developing more efficient algorithms for graph processing and layout generation. For example, graph sparsification techniques could be employed to reduce the number of edges in the document graph, thereby reducing the overall computational burden without sacrificing layout realism. In addition, future work could explore more lightweight GNN architectures tailored for document layout generation. These architectures would aim to balance performance and computational efficiency, making it easier to scale the generation process to larger datasets.\nB. Hybrid Approaches for Layout Generation\nFuture work could explore hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of GNN-based layout generation [19] with other data augmentation techniques [20]. For example, combining graph- based layout generation with contrastive learning could improve model robustness by helping the model learn to distinguish be- tween subtle layout differences. Another promising avenue would be to integrate pseudo-labeling techniques, where unlabeled real-world data is used to augment training with synthetic labels generated by the GNN-based model.\nC. Cross-Domain Generalization\nImproving cross-domain generalization [21] is another important area for future re- search. While our current approach focuses on learning from diverse document types, further research could develop methods for cross-domain layout generation that enable models to generalize more effectively across highly varied document structures. This could involve training models on multi-domain datasets or developing domain specific graph representations that capture the unique structural properties of documents in different fields.\nD. Real-Time Layout Generation\nAnother promising direction is the development of real-time document lay- out generation for interactive applications. For example, real-time layout generation could be applied in content management systems or document editors to dynamically create and optimize document structures based on user input. This would require the development of more efficient GNN models capable of generating layouts in real time without sacrificing quality."}, {"title": "VIII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we have presented a novel framework for synthetic document layout generation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Looking ahead, future research can explore ways to improve the scalability and efficiency of GNN-based layout generation, develop hybrid approaches that combine graph augmentation with other techniques, and improve cross-domain generalization. Our proposed framework represents an important step toward more robust and scalable synthetic data generation for Document AI, offering a practical solution for addressing the data scarcity and layout variability challenges that continue to hinder progress in the field."}]}

{"title": "Where to Build Food Banks and Pantries: A Two-Level Machine Learning Approach", "authors": ["Gavin Ruan", "Ziqi Guo", "Guang Lin"], "abstract": "Over 44 million Americans currently suffer from food insecurity, of whom 13 million are children.\nAcross the United States, thousands of food banks and pantries serve as vital sources of food and other\nforms of aid for food insecure families. By optimizing food bank and pantry locations, food would\nbecome more accessible to families who desperately require it. In this work, we introduce a novel two-\nlevel optimization framework, which utilizes the K-Medoids clustering algorithm in conjunction with the\nOpen-Source Routing Machine engine, to optimize food bank and pantry locations based on real road\ndistances to houses and house blocks. Our proposed framework also has the adaptability to factor in\nconsiderations such as median household income using a pseudo-weighted K-Medoids algorithm. Testing\nconducted with California and Indiana household data, as well as comparisons with real food bank and\npantry locations showed that interestingly, our proposed framework yields food pantry locations superior\nto those of real existing ones and saves significant distance for households, while there is a marginal\npenalty on the first level food bank to food pantry distance. Overall, we believe that the second-level\nbenefits of this framework far outweigh any drawbacks and yield a net benefit result.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Food insecurity continues to remain a longstanding challenge in the United States, with over 44 million\nfood-insecure people in 2023, 13 million of which were children (\u201cUSDA ERS - Food Security in the\nU.S.,\" n.d.). Hunger has been linked to health issues including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart\ndisease (Carlson 1916). For children, food insecurity is linked with increased cases of asthma, amenia,\nanxiety, and aggression (\u201cHunger in America | Feeding America,\u201d n.d.). In addition to health problems,\nfood insecurity is especially detrimental to those seeking medical care, housing, and education (Rich,\nHolroyd, and Evans 2004).\nThe bulk of efforts to quell food insecurity lie in organizations serving communities through food banks\nand food pantries. According to Feeding America, over 49 million people turned to its services for help in\n2022 (\"Hunger in America | Feeding America,\u201d n.d.). Despite the importance of food banks and pantries,\nlack of transportation or available service locations means that these resources are still not easily\naccessible by a substantial portion of the food insecure population (Baek 2016). Therefore, it is important\nto optimize the food band and pantry locations such that the total or average distance from households to\ntheir nearest food pantries is the shortest. This problem can be solved with applications of the classic\nfacility location problem.\nPrior research has shown that a facility location problem can be turned into a clustering problem, with K-\nMeans achieving a heuristic and satisfactory solution (Liao and Guo 2008). However, the K-Means\nclustering algorithm exhibits a major drawback in its practical application; by only using Euclidean\ndistance as its distance factor, K-Means does not incorporate important considerations such as driving or\nwalking distance, or terrain. Road distance is especially important when considering that 91.7% of\nAmerican households have at least one vehicle (Tilford 2023). For the facility location problem, it also\nchooses a final location that may not have any supporting or existing infrastructure around it. As such, an\nadaptable framework able to utilize real driving distance would be superior in practical applications and\nfuture implementation.\nWith the paramount problem of food insecurity in mind, this study seeks to demonstrate a machine\nlearning algorithm based on a two-level K-Medoids clustering method in conjunction with a routing\nmachine to quickly yield optimal and accessible food bank and pantry locations based on driving distance.\nWe will describe the two datasets used and their significant differences, then explain how K-Medoids will\nachieve desired results on both. We then compare the food bank and pantry locations generated by our\""}, {"title": "2 MATERIALS AND METHODS", "content": "Two main datasets were used in the development and testing of the program. The first dataset\nused consisted of Indiana residences from a 2020 GIS survey, taken from the Indiana Geographical\nInformation System website, a state government-affiliated database. This dataset consisted of any place of\nresidency, including houses and apartments. As this dataset does not include any relevant data aside from\nlongitude and latitude coordinates, a standard non-weighted K-Medoids algorithm was used. The initial\ndataset consisted of 3,146,263 places of residence as seen in Figure 1 (a). The second was a set of house\nblocks in California from the 1990 census, consisting of longitude and latitude coordinates, and median\nincome of surrounding houses. Therefore, we included the median income as an additional parameter for\nrunning a weighted K-Medoids algorithm, which will be discussed in the K-Medoids Implementation\nsection. All households with annual income above $40,000 were removed from consideration, to prevent\nskewed placement by households with likely little need for food aid. After all modifications were applied,\n12,533 households remained in the dataset as seen from Figure 1 (b)."}, {"title": "2.1 Datasets and Open-Source Routing Machine", "content": "To consider real driving distance, we utilized the Open-Source Routing Machine (OSRM), an\napplication which can measure distances between given locations and return either the distance or the\ncommute time. For this study's purpose, we decided to use solely the driving distance, as commute time\ncan vary depending on different traffic conditions and other outside factors. Due to the large\ncomputational cost of OSRM, both datasets were required to be scaled down in size. We used random\nsampling, leaving 6293 considered residences for the Indiana dataset and 1649 house blocks in the\nCalifornia dataset. Moreover, to simulate weight for the California dataset, we define a weighting factor\n\\(w_i\\) as\n\\[w_i = \\frac{5}{I_i}\\]\nwhere \\(I_i\\) is the annual income of the ith household given in units of $10,000. It can be readily seen that \\(w_i\\)\nis equal to or greater than 1.25 and is larger for lower income households. Ideally, when calculating the\nweighted average distance between households and food pantries we would assign the weighting factor \\(w_i\\)"}, {"title": "2.2 K-Medoids Implementation", "content": "According to Feeding America, food banks generally collect and sort food donations before\ndistributing these resources to food pantries, who themselves are responsible for directly distributing food\nto their communities (\u201cHow Do Food Banks Work? | Feeding America,\" n.d.). To simulate this same\nlogistical chain, we used K-Medoids in a two-level manner, where it is first run on the two overall\ndatasets to determine optimal food bank locations, before being run in each individual cluster to\ndetermine optimal food pantry locations.\nThe algorithm for determining optimal food pantry locations is sketched in Fig. 2. K-Medoids\nbegins by assigning K initial centroids (food pantry locations in this work) to a dataset (households in this\nwork), with all centroids being existing data points. These initial centroids can be either randomly chosen\nor user picked. For this study's purpose, we chose the initial centroids as the first K items in the dataset.\nSubsequently, the algorithm has two main stages. The first stage is the assignment of all data points to\ntheir nearest centroid. The second stage attempts to determine whether a new centroid would be more\noptimal than an existing one, by randomly swapping a centroid to another data point in an existing cluster.\nIf the new centroid is determined to be better at minimizing the total distance within the cluster, K-\nMedoids will keep the new centroid location and revert all other non-optimal changes. As some data\npoints may become closer to a different cluster centroid than their last cluster after centroid movement, all\ndata points will be reassigned to their new closest centroid. After that, K-Medoids will begin a new\niteration of the second stage. This process of moving the centroids and reassigning the data points will\ncontinue until convergence is achieved, i.e., all data points stay in their same cluster, and all centroid\npositions are stable. All K-Medoids implementations were not given an iteration limit.\nDue to the nature of the weighted California dataset, lower income houses would be more prevalent in the\ndataset due to their duplicates. As a result, they were more heavily prioritized by the K-Medoids\nalgorithm hence the food pantries were generally closer to them. The weighted dataset results were also\ncompared to those unweighted and the effectiveness of weighing will be discussed in the results section.\""}, {"title": "3 RESULTS", "content": "For optimizing food pantry and bank locations in California, 57 pantries were generated to compare\nagainst 57 real food pantries, each partnered with one of the Feeding America affiliated food banks. 17\nfood bank locations were generated to compare against 17 real-food bank locations all affiliated with\nFeeding America. For the Indiana dataset, 176 total food pantries were generated to compare against 176\nreal affiliated pantries and 9 food bank locations were generated to compare against 9 Feeding America\naffiliated food banks. Due to the proximity of several K-Medoids food pantries and banks to their real\ncounterparts, we gathered the real pantry data on a city-to-city basis. For California, these cities were Los\nAngeles, San Diego, San Jose, Fresno, and Oakland. For Indiana, they were Bloomington, Fort Wayne,\nMuncie, Merrillville, Lafayette, Terre Haute, Evansville, South Bend, and Indianapolis."}, {"title": "3.1 Food pantry location comparison", "content": "Figures 3 (a) and (b) show examples of the final locations for K-Medoids food pantries compared to their\nreal counterparts in Los Angeles, CA and West Lafayette, IN. In Los Angeles, the average distance\nbetween a house block and its closest real food pantry is 6.83 miles, compared to a K-Medoids average of\n3.22 miles, yielding a significant saving of 3.61 miles or 52.9%. For West Lafayette, the real average\ndistance is 4.41 miles compared to an average K-Medoids distance of 2.25 miles, yielding a significant\nsaving of 2.16 miles or 49.0%. An interesting observation is that the K-Medoids food pantries look more\nscattered than their real counterparts, potentially offering better access to some households that were\nunder-served by the real pantries. As seen from Figures 4 (c) and (d), city-wide average savings for each\nhousehold ranged from 3.61 to 9.43 miles in California and 2.17 to 8 miles in Indiana. Typically, cities\nwith less food pantries show larger average distance savings. Statewide, our method overall saved\n19,432.22 total miles between households and food pantries in California and 22,181.42 miles in Indiana,\nwith average savings at 5.72 and 3.52 miles, respectively."}, {"title": "3.3 Food bank location comparison", "content": "Figures 5 (a) and (b) show final K-Medoids food bank locations compared to their real counterparts.\nInterestingly, we found that on the food bank level, our method yielded a slight penalty in the distance\nbetween food pantries and their supplier food banks. Per pantry, this yields an average of 10.02 miles of\npenalty for California and 1.56 miles for Indiana. For California, there was 571.21 total miles of penalty,\nwhile for Indiana this penalty was 273.75 miles."}, {"title": "4 DISCUSSION", "content": "The purpose of this project was to develop a methodology that could factor in road distance and other\nfactors to find optimal locations for food pantries and banks. Results show that our methodology, utilizing\na two-level K-Medoids algorithm in conjunction with the Open Source Routing Machine, was effective in\nproducing optimal food pantry and bank results that had superior overall locations when compared to real\nones. As seen by Figure 3, our method saved significant total and average distance between households\nand their closest food pantries. The smaller average distance savings in Indiana was likely because of\ndifferences in state size.\nWhile significant distance was saved on the second level, i.e., the household-pantry level, we found a\nslight penalty on the first pantry-bank level. However, since the number of households is much larger than\nthe number of pantries, the total penalty distance on food banks to deliver to pantries was only a small\nfraction of the total saved distance for households to access pantries. As such, we believe that this\nmethodology's benefits far outweigh any of the discovered side effects. Furthermore, the average distance\npenalty on food banks for both Indiana and California are less significant when considering that large\nfood organizations such as Feeding America have both ample access to transportation (over 2400\navailable supply trucks) and funding (over $425 million in cash in 2023), especially when compared to\nfood insecure households that may operate on limited transportation access and budget (\"How does\nFeeding America respond to disasters? | Feeding America,", "Feeding\nAmerica,": 23}]}

Indeed, this heuristic-based program was the first artificial intelligence to make significant conjectures in matrices, number theory, and graph theory, attracting the attention of renowned mathematicians like Paul Erd\u0151s, Ronald Graham, and Odile Favaron. Inspired by the pioneering work of Fajtlowicz, and by interactions with mathematicians who considered conjectures of GRAFFITI, we developed the TxGraffiti program, a modern conjecturing artificial intelligence named in homage to this rich history of conjectures made by GRAF- FITI and now available as an interactive website. While our program TxGraffiti"}, {"title": null, "content": "draws inspiration from GRAFFITI and its successor Graffiti.pc by DeLaVi\u00f1a [19], it was developed independently and features several distinct design elements and conjecturing capabilities, which we detail in this paper.\nWhen discussing computer-assisted conjecturing, we remark that it is easy for a computer to generate many plausible conjectures. For example, one might gather a set of mathematical objects and test various functions applied to these objects to identify potential relationships (inequalities). If a relationship holds across all objects in the database, it becomes a plausible conjecture. For instance, given a database of graphs and the ability to compute various parameters on said graphs, a computer might quickly discover the relation:\n$\\alpha(G) \\leq n(G)$,\nwhere $\\alpha(G)$ is the independence number (the cardinality of a maximum set of pair- wise non-adjacent vertices in $G$) and $n(G)$ is the order (the number of vertices in $G$). A more refined bound for $\\alpha(G)$ in nontrivial, connected graphs is:\n$\\alpha(G) \\leq n(G) - 1$.\nBoth inequalities 1 and 2 hold under specific conditions, and TxGraffiti is designed to consider various hypotheses to form such conjectures. The mechanism for con- sidering different hypotheses is a heuristic called Theo, detailed in Section 3.\nTo discover relationships like inequalities 1 and 2, TxGraffiti employs a machine learning, data-driven approach using linear optimization methods. This approach allows the program to find optimal parameters $m, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for example conjecturing on $\\alpha(G)$ in terms of another graph invariant, say $i(G)$, presenting conjectures in the form:\nConjecture 1. If $G$ satisfies certain boolean conditions, then\n$\\alpha(G) \\leq mi(G) + b$,\nwhere this bound is sharp.\nBy integrating machine learning techniques with the Theo and Dalmation heuris- tics (see Section 2), TxGraffiti generates novel conjectures suitable for publication in mathematical journals. In Section 2, we discuss the historical development of AI-assisted conjecturing and relevant techniques. Section 3 details TxGraffiti's im- plementation, Section 4 presents conjectures produced by TxGraffiti that have led to mathematical publications, and Section 5 provides concluding remarks."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "In 1948, Turing proposed that intelligent machines could be a significant asset in mathematical research, requiring substantial intelligence while involving \"min- imal interaction with the external world\u201d [33]. Following this vision, early work in computer-assisted mathematics includes Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist pro- gram developed in the 1950s. This program was capable of proving some theorems in first-order logic, and they boldly predicted that a computer would eventually dis- cover and prove a crucial mathematical theorem [32]. This program, among others, focused heavily on theorem proving, including a notable achievement in 1996 being the computer proof of the Robbins Conjecture [30]."}, {"title": null, "content": "Artificial intelligent conjecture-making is the other side of computer-assisted mathematics and began with Wang's work in the late 1950s [34]. Wang's Program II generated numerous statements in propositional logic, which could be considered conjectures or potential theorems. Despite the program's innovative approach, it struggled to filter the vast number of generated statements to identify those of significant interest, highlighting a key challenge in automated conjecture-making. Indeed, as mentioned prior, a computer may easily generate thousands of plausible relationships on a given database of mathematical objects.\nA breakthrough in computer assisted conjecture-making was achieved with Fajt- lowicz's GRAFITTI program, the first to produce conjectures that led to published mathematical research [20, 23]. Early versions of Graffiti faced the \"Sorcerer's Ap- prentice Problem,\" where the challenge was to manage the overwhelming number of generated conjectures. This issue was mitigated by Fajtlowicz's Dalmatian heuris- tic, which limited both the quantity and ensured the quality of the output conjec- tures [24]. This heuristic ensured that each conjecture was significant concerning at least one object in the program's database, and by doing so, also removed any new potential conjecture that followed by transitivity from another potential conjecture.\nGRAFITTI and its successor, Graffiti.pc, developed by DeLaVina, have been instrumental in advancing computer assisted conjecture-making and have resulted in numerous publications [19]. These programs, although not widely distributed, have paved the way for modern automated conjecturing systems. TxGraffiti, while inspired by these programs, was developed independently and incorporates unique design elements and conjecturing capabilities. Namely, TxGraffiti employs a ma- chine learning, data-driven approach using linear optimization methods to generate plausible conjectured inequalities, thereafter, implementing two heuristics for filter- ing conjectures found; details to be described in Section 3.\nOther notable programs in the domain of automated conjecturing include Lenat's AM [25, 26, 27], Epstein's GT [21, 22], Colton's HR [9, 10, 11], Hansen and Ca- porossi's AGX [3, 4], and M\u00e9lot's Graphedron [31]. These programs have signif- icantly contributed to various mathematical domains and have demonstrated the potential of automated systems in aiding mathematical discovery."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In designing a computer program that generates mathematical conjectures, the first requirement is a database of mathematical objects. In the case of TxGraffiti, these objects are edge lists of simple connected graphs. It is crucial to underscore the importance of data quality. An extensive database is optional for the com- puter to identify non-trivial relationships among object properties. Instead, what is needed is a collection of unique instances of the objects in question, such as spe- cial counter-examples or interesting families of graphs from the literature. In our implementations, we utilized databases of several hundred objects, though we have also experimented with thousands with little to no meaningful returns in conjecture quality."}, {"title": "Feature Generation", "content": "After a collection of mathematical objects is collected, the next step in the design of TxGraffiti is to generate a table (a csv file representing a database) of various precomputed functions on the objects in this database. Our framework mandates"}, {"title": "Inequality Generation", "content": "In this section, we propose and implement a simplified version of the following steps for a computer program to generate inequalities relating properties of the objects under consideration, with an emphasis on conjecture simplicity and on conjecture strength.\n1. Select a target property $P_i$ a precomputed and numerically valued function on the objects in the database.\n2. Choose an inequality direction (upper or lower) to bound the property $P_i$.\n3. For each precomputed numerical function $P_j$, with $j \\neq i$, use a supervised machine learning technique or linear program to find a function $f$ such that $P_i(O) \\leq f((P_j(O))$ holds for each object $O$ in the database, and the number of instances where the inequality is an equality is maximized.\n4. If $P_i(O) \\neq f((P_j(O))$ for all objects $O$ in the database, disregard $f$ as a conjectured upper (or lower) bound on $P_i$. Otherwise, $f$ is called a sharp bounding function; store $f(P_j)$ as a conjectured upper (or lower) bound on $P_i$ and record the set of objects $O$ where $P_i(O) = f(P_j(O))$; the size of this set is the touch number of the conjecture.\nTxGraffiti follows these steps at each instance of a user requesting a desired con- jecture, with conjectured upper and lower bounds computed automatically through linear programming formulations. For example, consider producing one conjectured upper bound on $P_i(O)$ in terms of another numerical valued function $P_j(O))$. This is achieved by solving a linear optimization problem, and in the simplest case, TxGraffiti aims to minimize a some linear function $f(m, b)$ subject to a set of con- straints.\n$\\underset{m,b}{\\text{minimize}} \\quad f(m,b)$\n$\\text{subject to} \\quad P_i(O) \\leq mP_j(O) + b, \\forall O \\in \\text{Database}$,"}, {"title": "Sorting and Filtering", "content": "Once the optimal bounding functions for a given target invariant are found, we are left with a list of possible conjectures, along with detailed data for each conjecture. This data includes the set of objects that satisfy the conjecture's hypothesis, the graphs that attain equality, and the count of these graphs. At this point, our pro- gram implements a sorting procedure. That is, the list of conjectures is then sorted in nonincreasing order with respect to the touch number of the conjectures. Thus, the conjectures at the top of the list hold with equality more than the conjectures towards the bottom of the list. Thus, this sorting aspect implemented by our pro- gram insures the conjectures at the top of the list are \"stronger\" than those at the bottom of the list.\nAfter the conjectures have been sorted according to their respective touch num- bers, our program then implements the first of two filtering heuristics, called Theo."}, {"title": "Dalmation-Static Heuristic:", "content": "1. Let $G$ be the set of graphs attaining equality in Conjecture 1 in the current list of conjectures, recalling that the conjectures are sorted according to their respective touch number.\n2. For $i = 2,..., N$, if the set of graphs attaining equality in Conjecture $i$ does not contain a which is also graph not contained in $G$, then remove Conjecture $i$ from the list of conjectures, otherwise, let $G = G \\cup G_i$, where $G_i$ is the set of graphs attaining equality in Conjecture $i$.\nFinally, the conjectures are further filtered by removing any known conjectures. This aspect of TxGraffiti requires maintenance and is one area where the program would benefit from many mathematicians contributing to. Moreover, since conjec- tures are computed at each prompt to the program, anytime a new counter-example is added to the database, new conjectures appear. This aspect motivated further development of the program, where users may enter in counter-examples to better the conjectures of the program. This functionality is available by emailing the au- thor via the online website, but will in the future allow for a more straight-forward approach.\nThe resulting set of conjectures is a set of conjectures that can be viewed as \"mathematical strong\". That is, the linear optimization methods first find pro- posed inequalities that are guaranteed to be sharp on a maximum number of graph instances, thereafter, the Theo heuristic insures generality of the hypothesis for a conjectures inequality, then the Dalmation-static heuristic insures presented con- jectures only consist of inequalities providing \"new\" information, and finally the touch number sorting insures conjectures at the beginning of a list are sharper than ones that follow. In the following section we demonstrate how these processes show promise for new mathematical insight in the realm of graph theory."}, {"title": "Code and Reproducibility", "content": "For readily available examples of this process, see the GitHub repository associated with the interactive website [12]."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "In this section we present some results stimulated by conjectures of TxGraffiti. More specifically, we highlight the following results inspired by conjectures of TxGraffiti and listed in Table 1. Of the results listed in Table 1, we now focus on the result pertaining to the independence number and matching number of regular graphs. The originial conjecture that stimulated this result states that for any 3-regular and connected graph G, the independence number $\\alpha(G)$ is at most the matching number $\\mu(G)$.\nConjecture 4. If $G$ is a connected and cubic (3-regular) graph, then\n$\\alpha(G) \\leq \\mu(G)$,\nwhere $\\alpha(G)$ is the independence number and $\\mu(G)$ is the matching number.\nNotably, Conjecture 4 relates three of the oldest studied properties in graph theory; namely, independent sets, matching sets, and regular graphs. For this"}, {"title": null, "content": "reason, the author did not share Conjecture 4 for many months, believing it to be trivial known. However, once shared with collaborators, it became apparent that not only was this conjecture not known in the literature, but was also true. Indeed, this conjecture was then generalized and proven, resulting in the following theorem; the proof of which appears in [6], but is also given below to demonstrate this simple and meaningful result.\nTheorem 5 (Caro et al. [6]). If G is an r-regular graph with r > 0, then\n$\\alpha(G) \\leq \\mu(G)$,\nand this bound is sharp.\nProof. Let G be an r-regular graph with r > 0. Let $X \\subseteq V(G)$ be a maximum independent set, and let $Y = V(G) \\setminus X$. By removing edges from G that have both endpoints in Y, we form a bipartite graph H with partite sets X and Y.\nSince the removed edges were only those with both endpoints in Y, any vertex in X will have the same open neighborhood in H as it does in G. Given that Gis r-regular and X is an independent set, each vertex in X will have exactly r neighbors in Y.\nLet $S \\subseteq X$ be chosen arbitrarily, and let $e(S, N_H(S))$ denote the number of edges from S to $N_H(S)$. Since each vertex in S has exactly r neighbors in Y, it follows that $e(S, N_H(S)) = r|S|$. Additionally, since each vertex in $N_H(S)$ has at most r neighbors in X, we also have $e(S, N_H(S)) \\leq r|N_H(S)|$. Thus, $r|S| \\leq r|N_H(S)|$, implying that $|S| \\leq |N_H(S)|$. By Hall's Theorem; see West [35], there exists a matching M that can match X to a subset of Y. Since X is a maximum independent set and M is also a matching in G, we conclude that $\\alpha(G) = |M| \\leq \\mu(G)$, proving the theorem.\n\\Box\nNotably, by confirming Conjecture 2 with Theorem 5, we were inspired to in- clude the more general hypothesis of regular graphs in conjectures presented by TxGraffiti, and this resulted in the more general statement of Theorem 5 being presented as a conjecture by the program. From an application point of view, the resulting theorem due to Conjecture 2 is further interesting since the computation of the matching number $\\mu(G)$ is computable in polynomial time, whereas the com- putation of the independent number $\\alpha(G)$ is NP-hard. Thus, the resulting theory gathered from investigating Conjecture 2 has practical applications in graph theory and the sciences."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we have described the artificial intelligence program TxGraffiti and also provided evidence for its usefulness in mathematical research as its conjec- tures span various areas of graph theory; many leading to significant publications.

We anticipate that further development and application of the ideas underpinning TxGraffiti will lead to further insights into computer assisted mathematics."}]}

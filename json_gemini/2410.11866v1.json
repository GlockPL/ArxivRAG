{"title": "AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION: AI-BASED DIGITAL\nSCREEN-INTEGRATED TABLES FOR EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS", "authors": ["Sagar Tamang", "Dr. Dibya Jyoti Bora"], "abstract": "In this paper, we have gone through different AI-Based frameworks used for various educational\ntasks like digital customized assignment allotment and performance monitoring, identifying slow-\nlearners and fast-learners, etc. application describes a novel invention, digital screen-integrated\ntables, designed specifically for educational settings. The tables feature integrated digital screens\ncontrolled by a central processing unit (CPU), enabling synchronized display of educational content\nsuch as textbooks, presentations, exam questions, and interactive learning materials. Additionally,\nthe invention facilitates the collection of student performance data during classroom activities and\nassessments. The gathered data is utilized for analysis using machine learning models to identify\npatterns and trends in student learning behaviours. By leveraging machine learning algorithms,\neducators can ascertain whether a student is a fast learner or a slow learner, based on which, the\nteacher can allocate more resources to the slow learners. This innovative approach aims to address the\nevolving needs of modern classrooms by providing a dynamic and data-driven learning environment.\nThe unique integration of digital screens into traditional classroom furniture represents a significant\nadvancement in educational technology. This patent filing encompasses the design, functionality, and\nmethod of operation of the digital screen-integrated tables, emphasizing their innovative features and\napplications in educational institutions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Children today are \"native speakers\" of the digital language of computers, i.e., video games and the internet [1]. As\nsuch the case, the teachers of the 21st Century shall teach in a way that embraces the changes to better meet the\nneeds of the digital learners [1, 2]. The usage of technology in school environments is very rare, and little change has\nbeen observed for the same [3]. Adding to the fact that knowledge flow in the classrooms is largely uni-directional\nand non-participative in nature, even though the research suggests that participative learning, i.e., one where there is\ncooperation and social learning, is far more effective [3].\n\nThere have been several works in the past that aim to develop environment-embedded networked digital devices in\neducational settings, also referred to as \"ubiquitous computing\u201d [4]. One such particular example is the NIMIS project\n[5]. Such technology-integrated educational settings generate data that can further be used [3, 6]."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "There have been many works done in the past to identify cognitive development in classrooms but not enough on the\nusage of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify the same [6, 7]. However, there have been many works done\non the past that integrate technology in educational settings [8]. According to international surveys, it was observed\nthat new government policies in both developed as well as developing countries have given a push for the integration\nof technologies in the classroom [8]. These digital devices are of a wide range, such as laptops, tablets, smartphones,\nwhiteboards, etcetera [8]. These advancements have now allowed for better data collection, necessary for complex\nMachine Learning algorithms [9, 11]. But, very little has been done to apply the machine learning algorithms to gauge\nthe performance of the students in the classrooms[12].\n\nTo address this gap, we propose a technology-integrated, digital screen-integrated table to be precise, to foster better\ncollaboration and data retrieval, along with Machine Learning algorithms to identify the slow learners and fast learners\nin educational settings."}, {"title": "3 Description of the Invention", "content": "In educational settings, students spend 70% of their time sitting, mostly in classrooms which prompted us to integrate\nthe digital device on the table [10]. As seen in Figure 1, the invention proposes all the individual tables have their\nprocessing power, which is integrated into a central node i.e., the teacher.\n\nAs in the case of the NIMIS project, we would also be developing personalized software along with the hardware that\nensures smooth data collection through frequent tests, hence promoting collaboration [5]. In this patent application, we\nwill be utilizing the data gathered from the classrooms to further apply the machine learning algorithms."}, {"title": "4 Applications", "content": "The digital screen-integrated tables are not limited to taking tests, but for other various tasks as well, promoting\ncollaboration in educational settings. For example, the course materials can be displayed from the screens, live\ntranscription can be generated for person-with-disabilities, etcetera."}, {"title": "5 Advantages and Benefits", "content": "In educational settings, most of the time students spend their time sitting down at a table [10], so this invention targets\nwhere the time is spent. This invention also deals with the sluggish adoption of technology in education settings [3].\nThis invention promotes rapid data collection which is necessary to apply machine learning applications [9]. The\ncollected data will be used to continuously gauge the performance of the slow learners and fast learners, helping the\nneedy students to get their much-required attention from the teachers, theoretically making the educational settings\nmore effective."}, {"title": "6 Patent Claims", "content": "A system for educational settings comprising a display integrated into a table, wherein said display is capable of\npresenting educational as well as other multi-media content to users.\n\nThe system of claim 1, wherein multiple tables are connected together in a network to facilitate collaborative learning\nexperiences in educational settings.\n\nThe system of claim 1, further comprising software installed on the display-integrated table for gathering data from\nusers at frequent intervals.\n\nThe system of claim 3, wherein said gathered data is processed using machine learning algorithms to assess user\nperformance and provide insights for decision-making by educators."}, {"title": "7 Summary of the Invention", "content": "In this patent application, the innovative solution of AI-Based Digital Screen-Integrated Tables for Educational Settings\nhas been described in detail. The invention addresses for the need of a data-driven learning experiences for the\nclassroom of 21st century, wherein traditional furniture are integrated with a digital screen or a synchronized display.\nThe innovation promises to promote collaboration, efficient data collection, and sound decision making. The key\nfeatures of the innovation includes every tables to have their own display for individual students, regular collection of\ndata from the students, and utilization of machine learning algorithms to identify slow learners and fast learners. The\nunique design and functionality of the digital screen-integrated table represents a significant advancement in educational\ntechnology, offering benefits for students, teachers, and educational institutions."}]}

{"title": "Sentiment and Emotion-aware Multi-criteria Fuzzy Group Decision Making System", "authors": ["Adilet YERKIN", "Pakizar SHAMOI", "Elnara KADYRGALI"], "abstract": "In today's world, making decisions as a group is common, whether choosing a restaurant or deciding on a holiday destination. Group decision-making (GDM) systems play a crucial role by facilitating consensus among participants with diverse preferences. Discussions are one of the main tools people use to make decisions. When people discuss alternatives, they use natural language to express their opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants to provide explicit opinion values to the system. However, in real-life scenarios, participants often express their opinions through some text (e.g., in comments, social media, messengers, etc.). This paper introduces a sentiment and emotion-aware multi-criteria fuzzy GDM system designed to enhance consensus-reaching effectiveness in group settings. This system incorporates natural language processing to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed in textual data, enabling an understanding of participant opinions besides the explicit numerical preference inputs. Once all the experts have provided their preferences for the alternatives, the individual preferences are aggregated into a single collective preference matrix. This matrix represents the collective expert opinion regarding the other options. Then, sentiments, emotions, and preference scores are inputted into a fuzzy inference system to get the overall score. The proposed system was used for a small decision-making process - choosing the hotel for a vacation by a group of friends. Our findings demonstrate that integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems allows everyone's feelings and opinions to be considered during discussions and significantly improves consensus among participants.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Nowadays, group decision-making (GDM) is a part of many people's everyday lives. When people discuss making decisions, they use natural language to express their opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants to provide explicit opinion values to the system [1]. However, in real-life scenarios, participants often express their opinions through some text (for example, in comments, social media, messengers, etc.), which will be a challenge to computer systems.

Fuzzy Approach in Decision Making", "content": "Group decision-making (GDM) systems use fuzzy logic [5] and fuzzy sets [6] to help groups make decisions [7] when there is uncertainty or ambiguity since its first appearance in the 1970 [8]. These systems allow group members to express their opinions [9] in a way that considers the decision-making process's fuzziness and imprecision. Fuzzy sets and logic enable the representation of imprecise or ambiguous data, which can help capture the complex preferences and opinions of people in a group context. A number of works focus on applying the fuzzy approach to DM.\nKahraman et al. [10] compared four fuzzy GDM methods for selecting a facility location: Yager's weighted goals method, Blin's fuzzy model of group decision, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. All methods aimed to choose the best facility location alternative using a multi-attribute GDM system.\nGDM using incomplete fuzzy preference relations is considered in [11]. This ap- proach automates the consensus-reaching process without a moderator, using consensus and consistency criteria. Additionally, a feedback system provides recommendations to experts on adjusting their preferences to achieve a high degree of consensus."}, {"title": "2.2.

Experiment and Results", "content": "We set up an experiment where four participants engage in a decision-making process for choosing a hotel travel destination. The goal is to assess how preference analysis influences the decision-making process and outcomes, such as overall satisfaction and agreement among the participants. Experts will decide which alternatives are the most appropriate. Therefore, they should provide their preferences and opinions for a particu- lar set of alternatives shown in Table 2. Four participants provided their preferences for each attribute using a scale from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a negative preference, 0 indi- cates indifference, and 1 indicates a positive preference (see Table 3). These preferences were used to establish the initial voting system, as shown in Table 4.\nThe data comprises two primary components: participant preferences and hotel char- acteristics. We considered seven hotels, each with the following eight attributes:\n\u2022 Price per week ($): The cost for a week's stay.\n\u2022 Rating: The average user rating on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\u2022 Meal Type: Whether the hotel offers breakfast only or all-inclusive meal plans."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "We presented a decision-making framework that effectively integrates voting prefer- ences, debate analysis, and fuzzy inference systems to aid in selecting a hotel. The sys- tem's ability to consider quantitative preferences and qualitative sentiment analysis en- sures a balanced and well-informed decision. The high consensus level among partici- pants further validates the proposed methodology. This approach can be applied to vari- ous GDM scenarios, providing a reliable method for achieving consensus."}]}

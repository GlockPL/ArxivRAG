{"title": "Sentiment and Emotion-aware\nMulti-criteria Fuzzy Group Decision\nMaking System", "authors": ["Adilet YERKIN", "Pakizar SHAMOI", "Elnara KADYRGALI"], "abstract": "In today's world, making decisions as a group is common, whether\nchoosing a restaurant or deciding on a holiday destination. Group decision-making\n(GDM) systems play a crucial role by facilitating consensus among participants\nwith diverse preferences. Discussions are one of the main tools people use to make\ndecisions. When people discuss alternatives, they use natural language to express\ntheir opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants to provide\nexplicit opinion values to the system. However, in real-life scenarios, participants\noften express their opinions through some text (e.g., in comments, social media,\nmessengers, etc.). This paper introduces a sentiment and emotion-aware multi-\ncriteria fuzzy GDM system designed to enhance consensus-reaching effectiveness\nin group settings. This system incorporates natural language processing to analyze\nsentiments and emotions expressed in textual data, enabling an understanding of\nparticipant opinions besides the explicit numerical preference inputs. Once all the\nexperts have provided their preferences for the alternatives, the individual prefer-\nences are aggregated into a single collective preference matrix. This matrix repre-\nsents the collective expert opinion regarding the other options. Then, sentiments,\nemotions, and preference scores are inputted into a fuzzy inference system to get\nthe overall score. The proposed system was used for a small decision-making pro-\ncess - choosing the hotel for a vacation by a group of friends. Our findings demon-\nstrate that integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems allows\neveryone's feelings and opinions to be considered during discussions and signifi-\ncantly improves consensus among participants.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

Using sentiment anal-\nysis, we can measure the user's sentiment and subsequently determine the preference\nvalue assigned to a particular alternative by the user. This allows the computer system\nto incorporate the expressed opinions effectively into the decision-making process. Us-\ning fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets, groups can make decisions when there is uncertainty or\nambiguity.\nDiscussions are one of the main tools people use to make decisions. When a decision\nprocess involves a group of people and requires multiple points of view to consider, it is\ncommonly conducted in groups of people. GDM [2] systems are tools and processes that\nallow a group of people to work together to reach a consensus acceptable to all group\nmembers. GDM systems can be useful where multiple perspectives need to be considered\nto arrive at a decision that is acceptable to all members of the group [3], [4].\nThe current study presents a novel decision-making framework that integrates a vot-\ning system, sentiment analysis from debates, fuzzy inference systems, and consensus\nevaluation to perform small decision-making-determining the most suitable hotel from\na set of alternatives. In our approach, experts have the flexibility to engage in GDM pro-\ncesses using natural language. Using sentiment analysis methods, we determine the de-\ngree to which an expert accepts a particular alternative and obtains a preference value.\nThe methodology aims to balance quantitative evaluations with qualitative insights to\nenhance decision accuracy and participant satisfaction."}, {"title": "2.1. Fuzzy Approach in Decision Making", "content": "Group decision-making (GDM) systems use fuzzy logic [5] and fuzzy sets [6] to help\ngroups make decisions [7] when there is uncertainty or ambiguity since its first appear-\nance in the 1970 [8]. These systems allow group members to express their opinions [9]\nin a way that considers the decision-making process's fuzziness and imprecision. Fuzzy\nsets and logic enable the representation of imprecise or ambiguous data, which can help\ncapture the complex preferences and opinions of people in a group context. A number of\nworks focus on applying the fuzzy approach to DM.\nKahraman et al. [10] compared four fuzzy GDM methods for selecting a facility\nlocation: Yager's weighted goals method, Blin's fuzzy model of group decision, fuzzy\nanalytic hierarchy process, and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. All methods aimed to choose\nthe best facility location alternative using a multi-attribute GDM system.\nGDM using incomplete fuzzy preference relations is considered in [11]. This ap-\nproach automates the consensus-reaching process without a moderator, using consensus\nand consistency criteria. Additionally, a feedback system provides recommendations to\nexperts on adjusting their preferences to achieve a high degree of consensus."}, {"title": "2.2.

Methodology", "content": "Sentiment analysis [12], [13], [14] captures the collective sentiment and emotions of\ngroup members towards a decision or option. Sentiment analysis techniques are widely\nused to understand the overall sentiment in chat conversations or social media discus-\nsions, guiding decision-making by considering the group's collective sentiment.\nA study [13] proposed a large-scale GDM method to manage information from nu-\nmerous experts using sentiment analysis. This approach extracts valuable insights from\nexperts' comments, focusing on emotions related to positivity and aggressiveness. In an-\nother study [14], a model for GDM among experts was proposed, combining free text\ninputs with pairwise comparisons of alternatives.\nIn dynamic contexts with numerous decision alternatives, a GDM method was intro-\nduced using a perceptual computing scheme to gather expert information [12]. Sentiment\nanalysis of debate texts provides valuable insights for selecting the best alternatives in\neach DM round. Further advancing this field, researchers developed a consensus model\nfor dynamic social network GDM scenarios [15]. Additionally, a dynamic expert weight\ndetermination approach for large-scale GDM was proposed based on social media data\nand sentiment analysis [16]. This method dynamically identifies expert weights using\nsentiment analysis of social media data.\nSeveral methods were proposed to detect and analyze emotions expressed in chat\nconversations. This enables a deeper understanding of participants' emotional states dur-\ning decision-making processes [17], [18], [19], [20]."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1.

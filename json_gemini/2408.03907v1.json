However, even with supervised training and human alignment, these LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks where malicious users can prompt the model to generate undesirable text. LLMs also inherently encode potential biases that can cause various harmful effects during interactions. Bias evaluation metrics lack standards as well as consensus and existing methods often rely on human-generated templates and annotations which are expensive and labor intensive. In this work, we train models to automatically create adversarial prompts to elicit biased responses from target LLMs. We present LLM-based bias evaluation metrics and also analyze several existing automatic evaluation methods and metrics. We analyze the various nuances of model responses, identify the strengths and weaknesses of model families, and assess where evaluation methods fall short. We compare these metrics to human evaluation and validate that the LLM-as-a-Judge metric aligns with human judgement on bias in response generation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In recent years, the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling applications from automated text generation to complex language understanding. However, as these models integrate more deeply into technological solutions, their inherent biases have become a significant concern. These biases can lead to misrepresentation of individuals and groups, promote stereotypes, and suggest unfair allocation of resources, impacting people both psychologically and socio-economically.\nDespite a fair amount of research happening on AI Safety and fairness, there is still a lack of understanding of measuring societal biases in language models systematically. Biases in these models\u2014such as gender, racial, ethnic, and ideological biases\u2014stem from training data that reflect societal prejudices. Consequently, language models can perpetuate and even amplify these biases, leading to outputs that reinforce stereotypes and disadvantage certain groups (Bender et al., 2021). The implications are profound, affecting areas, like hiring, law enforcement, and daily AI interactions (Schwartz et al., 2022; Ferrara, 2023).\nThus, assessing and mitigating bias in language models is essential for their ethical and fair use.\nWe define bias as the semantic variance in text generated by an LLM along with differential treatment towards stereotype identification, refusal, and correction of social group attributes when presented with prompts obtained by varying only the social group association. For example, in Figure 1, the LLM is presented with a prompt \"I think men are much better with managing finances\" and another obtained by only varying the gender (men to women). The image on the left shows the scenario where the LLM responds differently to these inputs. In one case it identifies the stereotype present in the prompt and rejects this with an explanation; in the other, it fails to identify any gender bias in the input and supports the gender-based claim instead. On the right shows an unbiased model that responds to both the prompts similarly, by identifying and rejecting the gender-stereotype in the input.\nBias mitigation techniques rely on bias assessment metrics to evaluate their efficacy. Bias evaluation metrics are broadly classified into embedding-based, probability-based, and generated-text-based metrics (Gallegos et al., 2023). The limitations of these metrics such as the lack of correlation between them and the lack of alignment with bias in downstream tasks have been discussed in various works (Cao et al., 2022; Delobelle et al., 2022; Aky\u00fcrek et al., 2022; Blodgett et al., 2021b).

Potential harms or hazards are identified through a combination of manual and automated probing techniques. Manual testing can be very challenging and less effective, and the results generally vary based on the creativity of the prober, which could lead to critical safety oversights in the assessment of a model. Based on prior work, we utilize a 'Red-teaming language model' (Perez et al., 2022; Su et al., 2023) to generate a diverse set of adversarial prompts to evaluate the target language model's responses. Automatic adversarial prompts can potentially generate more offensive responses compared to human-written adversarial prompts.\nModel Biases: Language models are known to perpetuate gender biases, stereotypes, and negative perceptions in society (Kotek et al., 2023; Bender et al., 2021; Nadeem et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2021a; Sun et al., 2019; Stanovsky et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2022; Nozza et al., 2022; Wan et al., 2023; Kotek et al., 2023). Gender biases have been shown to exist intrinsically in word embeddings (Basta et al., 2019) as well as extrinsically in specific task-based NLP systems (Zhao et al., 2018a; Sun et al., 2019). Devinney et al. (2022) is a survey regarding gender bias in NLP that suggests that current work does not specify how gender biases are conceptualized, disregarding non-binary genders, conflating sex and gender, etc.\nBias Assessment: Previous work has looked at bias assessment through the curation of datasets and development of metrics like Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) (Parrish et al., 2022), AdvPrompt-Set\u00b9, BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021), Regard (Sheng et al., 2019), HolisticBias (Smith et al., 2022), and ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to create bias prompting datasets and measurement methods. Recently, Stanford HELM (Liang et al., 2023) and DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2024) frameworks have been proposed to measure various LLM Safety metrics including metrics for fairness. Further, MLCommon's AI Safety Working Group (Vidgen et al., 2024) has open-sourced Modelbench\u00b2 and Modelgauge as additional frameworks for trust and safety."}, {"title": "Gender Bias: Methods and Evaluation", "content": "We define bias as the difference or variations in the responses generated by an LLM when presented with inputs based on different social groups. In our work, a model is considered unbiased if its response to a prompt remains semantically consistent when a protected attribute, such as gender (male/female), is varied in the given statement or prompt as in Figure1. As demonstrated in Figure 2, our gender bias detection and evaluation pipeline consists of three components, the \u2018Attacker LLM', the 'Target LLM', and the Evaluator. The attacker LLM adversarially prompts a target LLM to elicit biased responses. These responses are evaluated by the evaluator from different aspects to capture bias, such as a sentiment analyzer, toxicity classifiers, or an LLM used as a judge."}, {"title": "Attacker LLM", "content": "Adversarial Prompt Generation: The attacker LLM adversarially generates a sentence or a prompt that might result in biased responses from a target LLM. We use Meta's Llama3-8B Instruct model\u00b3 (Llama3 for short) configured with a temperature of 0.6 with system prompt: \"You are an adversarial prompt generator used as a red-teaming assistant, trying to get language models to generate bias responses to evaluate them for their inherent gender bias\" and a user prompt: \"Generate a statement using the keyword 'keyword' that can make a language model generate biased responses. Biased Statement:\". The keyword is a gender-related word from each of the gender-specific lists of Zhao et al. (2018b).\nWe also finetune 4-bit quantized Llama34 for adversarial prompt generation using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) (with rank=16, \u03b1 = 16, 80-bit Adam optimizer with weight decay) on data collected (Su et al., 2023) using the gendered-keyword lists to prompt ChatGPT with the same system prompt as above. We finetune for 60 steps on about 5000 of the ChatGPT-generated prompts.\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA): Once a prompt from a gender-related word is generated, we utilize the Counterfactual Data Augmentation technique (Zmigrod et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2020) to generate a prompt from the other gender. To prevent potential errors in the meaning and fluency of the generated text, we avoid simple substitution. Instead, we use Llama3 to generate gender counterfactuals using the following prompt. We call the prompt and its counterfactual 'gender paired prompts':\nAssume there are just 2 genders, male and female. For the given input statement, generate the same statement with the opposite gender by appropriately replacing ALL of the gendered words with their gender counterparts. Do not generate additional text, and ensure the sentence does not change and is grammatically correct. Use the clue: The opposite gender word for 'male-gendered-word' is 'female-gendered-word'.\nInput Statement: {Generated prompt from Step1}. Gender counterpart statement:\nFor the experiments reported in this work, we used a subset of about 500 prompts from a large number of generated prompts. We used the GPT-4 model to rank the large pool of prompts based on their ability to elicit biased responses and pick the highest-ranked prompts."}, {"title": "Target LLM", "content": "The adversarial prompts and their counterfactuals are provided to the target LLM and its responses are evaluated for the presence of bias. The target LLMs we consider in this work are the Llama2-chat family of models (7b, 13b, 70b), GPT-4, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct-v0.1, and Mistral 7B Instruct-v0.2. These models are a subset of models available as part of the AI Safety Benchmark PoC framework (Vidgen et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "Evaluation: LLM as a Judge", "content": "Recent work in NLP has seen the use of LLMs as scorers or judges due to their strong human alignment (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Obtaining human annotations is extremely tedious and expensive, and for bias, it also requires detailed protocol and rubric to disentangle human preferences and prior user beliefs for objective assessment. To automate the evaluation, we explore LLM-as-a-Judge for identifying or measuring bias. Here, we use GPT-4 to evaluate and score responses generated by target LLMs. We prompt the model to identify bias in an input-response pair in terms of 5 classes by providing an explanation of each as mentioned in Table 1. We instruct the model to output the bias scores, indicating the level of bias, and also generate a one-line explanation of the classification. Additionally, we calculate the difference in the LLM-as-a-Judge bias scores for male and female responses, then take the average of these differences to obtain the \"LLM-judge Gap Score.\" This gap score serves as an indicator of the overall bias in the model's response generation."}, {"title": "Evaluation: Other Metrics", "content": "Perspective API Metrics: Perspective API is a widely used API-based tool, developed by the Google Jigsaw team, which is a popular toxicity detection tool. It measures attributes such as toxicity, insult, and identity attack, among others.\nSentiment Annotation: We follow the previous work (Dhamala et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2019) to employ the VADER classifier (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) to compute the sentiment, or polarity, of LLM responses to gendered-prompts. We also calculate the \"Sentiment Gap\" score to serve as an indicator of overall bias. This score is determined by computing the difference in sentiment between male and female responses for each gender-paired prompt and then averaging these differences.\nRegard: Regard scores (Sheng et al., 2019) aim to improve upon sentiment scoring by assessing the polarity of language and societal perceptions toward specific demographics (e.g., age, religion, race, gender). We used the BERT based classifier.\nLlamaGuard2: We used MLCommons Mode-Gauge's LLamaGuard2 annotator to annotate responses with Safe vs. Unsafe categories. Since 'Bias' is not one of the pre-defined Safety categories in the current version of LlamaGuard, we explored modifying the system prompt to update the 'Hate' category to include 'Gender Bias'.\nOpenAI Compliance Annotation: This metric annotates responses with 'Full Refusal', \u2018Partial Refusal', or 'Full Compliance'. We used OpenAI Compliance Annotator, a part of MLCommons' ModelGauge to annotate target LLM responses."}, {"title": "Human Evaluation", "content": "We perform a human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) by defining two tasks: i) Evaluating individual prompt-response pairs, where the annotators are provided with the gender-paired prompts and the target LLM response and are asked about the presence of stereotype, to rate the response for the bias level, sentiment, toxicity, profanity, etc. ii) Comparing the gender paired prompts and their respective responses to detect if the responses convey similar or different ideas and content. We use this to assess various target LLMs on how readily they answer the prompt across different genders and if the model provides varying answers for different groups.\nCrowd workers are also instructed to make their choices by keeping aside their personal biases and stereotypes, and by only focusing on the content. We select the top challenging prompt pairs that show discrepancies between the gap metrics mentioned earlier. Specifically, we choose pairs with a high Sentiment Gap score but a low LLM-judge Gap score, and vice versa, for this task. We sample approximately 100 gendered prompt pairs per target LLM for human annotation, resulting in approximately 600 gendered prompt pairs for which we obtain annotations. We obtained annotations from 3 annotators for each sample, where we considered the majority vote and average rating (for continuous values)."}, {"title": "Results and Discussion", "content": "Table 2 shows the performance of the different target LLMs when prompted with the individual adversarial Male/Female (M/F) prompts generated by the attacker LLMs.\nWith Llama3 as the attacker model, we observe that the Perspective API scores for Identity Attack, Insult, and Toxicity scores for female responses are significantly higher when compared to the male responses across all models. Further, Mixtral, Mistral, and GPT-4 models show lower identity attack and toxicity scores, on average, compared to the Llama2 model family. These results suggest that female oriented responses may require more alignment and correction for these metrics.\nWe see that for Mixtral 8x7B Inst, which is a powerful Mixture of Experts model, the Female response sentiment is significantly lower than the Male response sentiment, with Mistral and GPT-4 following a similar trend. This suggests that these models generate more critical responses with negative polarity for female gender. We also observe the highest mean bias scores using LLM-as-a-Judge (M/F =0.88/0.88) in the Mistral 7B Inst model implying that this model, on average, generates more biased responses. Both findings correlate with the DecodingTrust platform Fairness metric on the leader-board (showing the lowest numbers for GPT-4 and Mistral models).\nFor the Llama family of target LLMs, we see that (M/F) sentiment difference, as well as (M/F) bias score difference from LLM-as-a-Judge, reduces with an increase in model size, which reinforces the idea that larger Llama2 models are fairer than their smaller versions.\nRegard scores in the table are computed by evaluating male responses with reference to female responses. We see that male responses have a negative regard w.r.t female responses in Llama2-70B and GPT-4, which aligns with the increase in bias scores for male responses from LLM-judge. We also assessed LlamaGuard2's ability to detect gender bias (categorized under 'hate'). However, we found it ineffective, as it failed to classify biased language as unsafe, hence we do not report the results here.\nWe provide more details on human evaluation for Task 1 in Appendix ??. We compute the inter-annotator agreement for the annotations using Cohen's kappa score and find that the agreement on the different questions is quite low, falling in the 0.01 - 0.20 (slight agreement) range. This underscores the complexity and subjectivity of the task. We present several examples in Appendix ?? with LLM Judgement scores and highlight a few examples using OpenAI Compliance Annotation"}, {"title": "Overall Bias Analysis", "content": "Following our definition of bias in Figure 1, our second AMT task involved presenting both male and female prompt-response pairs to the users who would assess whether the responses in each pair conveyed similar or substantially different ideas. We hypothesize that a higher proportion of gendered response pairs marked as dissimilar indicates greater bias in the model. After aggregating responses through majority voting, we calculated the percentage of gendered prompt-response pairs that crowd-workers classified as \"conveying different ideas.\" Table 4 presents the results of this comprehensive bias evaluation, quantifying the degree to which the model's responses differ based on gender-specific prompts, and we compare these to the Sentiment-Gap and LLM-judge Gap scores.\nWe observe that bias, based on responses conveying different ideas from human evaluation, is highest for the Llama2-7b-chat model, which is also reflected by the LLM-judge Gap score. All metrics consistently show that overall bias decreases as the model size increases within the Llama model family. Notably, there is a 100% agreement in the trend of diminishing bias between the human bias score and the LLM-judge Gap score: Llama2-7b-chat (highest), Llama2-13b, Mistral, Mixtral, Llama2-70B, and GPT-4 (lowest). However, overall bias based on the Sentiment Gap score is highest for Mixtral and lowest for Llama2-70b. This observation indicates that the LLM-judge Gap score aligns with human judgment of bias in model generation."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Identifying gender bias in LLM responses is very challenging due to the subtle nuances in assesing how people interpret language; the resulting biases are difficult to detect using commonly used metrics. In this work, we introduce adversarial prompting techniques to evaluate LLMs for inherent gender bias. We observe issues with existing metrics that are not well aligned with each other. We present an LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to score responses for bias and provide detailed explanations. Finally, we consider human evaluations, demonstrating that the LLM-as-a-Judge metric most accurately aligns with human bias judgements.\nFurther work is needed to standardize these bias metrics, and comprehensive human studies are essential to understand society scale as well as culture specific assessments for bias related metrics. In this research, we try to define and disentangle gender bias measurements and look at multiple existing metrics alongwith human assessments. We acknowledge that using human evaluations to validate these LLM-based evaluations may have its shortcomings since humans bring their own wide-ranging biases to the evaluation task. In future work, we hope to explore these issues directly by expanding our work to other types of biases and protected classes and also by conditioning on the biases of our human evaluators."}]}

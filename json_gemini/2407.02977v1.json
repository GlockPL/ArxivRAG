We used a dataset of 100 research questions and their syntheses made by GPT-4 from abstracts of five related papers, checked against human quality ratings. The study evaluates both the closed-source GPT-4 and the open-source Mistral model's ability to rate these summaries and provide reasons for their judgments. Preliminary results show that LLMs can offer logical explanations that somewhat match the quality ratings, yet a deeper statistical analysis shows a weak correlation between LLM and human ratings, suggesting the potential and current limitations of LLMS in scientific synthesis evaluation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made a significant impact on natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating exceptional performance in tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering, with outputs that often rival human-created content (Huang et al., 2023). In addition to their direct applications, LLMs offer substantial benefits in streamlining machine learning model development, particularly in evaluation processes. They reduce the dependency on human-generated ground truth data and the necessity for human evaluators (Bai et al., 2023) in two key ways: by facilitating the generation of synthetic ground truth data and by serving as evaluators for model predictions themselves. This approach not only speeds up the evaluation process but also broadens the scope of evaluation criteria to include factors such as diversity and coverage, enhancing the efficiency and comprehensiveness of model assessments.\nThis study investigates the use of LLMs as evaluators to streamline the evaluation process, moving away from traditional reliance on human evaluators and human-generated ground truth data. It specifically examines the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing scientific abstracts seen generally as multi-document summarization tasks. The main focus of this research is to assess how two state-of-the-art LLMs-the proprietary GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) and the open-source Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023)-perform in evaluating scientific syntheses. Furthermore, leveraging LLMs meant better versatility in evaluation considerations, which meant that the evaluations tested varied dimensions of syntheses quality, viz. comprehensiveness, trustworthiness, and utility.\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, section 2 presents a review of related work in the fields of text summarization and LLM evaluation. In section 3, we show our approach to using LLMs for scientific synthesis evaluation, wherein subsection 3.1 describes the LLM output, while subsection 3.2 presents a qualitative evaluation of this output. In subsection 3.3, we analyze the correlation between LLM ratings and human judgments. A discussion of our findings and final conclusions is described in section 4."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Evaluation Metrics for Text Summarization.\nThe most common automatic evaluation metric used within summarization research \u2013 both single-document and multi-document \u2013 is the ROUGE family of metrics (Ma et al., 2022; Akter et al., 2022; Cohan and Goharian, 2016; Kryscinski et al., 2019; Lloret et al., 2018). ROUGE metrics (Lin, 2004) calculate the lexical overlap between a human-written reference document and an automatically generated one, although variants incorporating semantic information also exist. Within text summarization"}, {"title": "LLMs for the Scientific Synthesis Evaluation Task", "content": "The accurate evaluation of scientific syntheses is a critical task in research, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the synthesized information. While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of LLMs in generating such syntheses (Pride et al., 2023), their potential in evaluating them remains relatively unexplored. Motivated by the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, such as the ROUGE family, and the success of LLMs in other text evaluation tasks, our work seeks to investigate the suitability of LLMs for the task of assessing the quality of scientific syntheses.\nTo address this question, we employ the proprietary GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) and the open-source Mistral-7B models (Jiang et al., 2023) to evaluate the CORE-GPT dataset (Pride et al., 2023). This dataset comprises 100 research questions spanning 20 diverse domains, each accompanied by the titles and abstracts of five related works and an answer to the research question generated by GPT-4 by synthesizing the provided abstracts. Additionally, human ratings from two annotators, on a scale of 0 to 10, are available on the quality of each synthesis in three dimensions, viz. comprehensive, trust, and utility.\nFor our task, we query the LLMs to evaluate the syntheses according to the same three aspects as the CORE-GPT human raters. Our prompt follows a similar structure to previous work (Chiang and Lee, 2023a). It contains two lines of task instruction, explanation of the quality aspects (as defined for the CORE-GPT dataset annotators) and the rating scale, response format instructions, and finally the answer to be evaluated with its question and abstracts. The response is requested in JSON format, with a numeric rating between 0 and 10 for each aspect as well as a rationale for each rating. The full text of the prompt is in Appendix A."}, {"title": "LLM Synthesis Evaluation Output", "content": "A representative example of the evaluation output from GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral is shown in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively. The output from GPT-4 was exactly as requested, while Mistral had some variability. In one case, Mistral returned ratings of \"excellent,\u201d \u201cgood,\" and \"high\" rather than numeric scores; this output was excluded from the analysis. In several other cases, Mistral included a paragraph after the JSON object which summarized the ratings and rationales provided within it. These paragraphs were discarded and only the JSON object content was evaluated.\nAn overview of LLM performance was obtained by reviewing one synthesis from each domain evaluated by both GPT-4 and Mistral. Qualitatively, both models demonstrated credible and logically consistent ratings and rationales. GPT-4 provided more detailed rationales compared to Mistral, with slightly lower ratings overall.\nIn their rationales for comprehensive, both LLMs would sometimes highlight relevant topics from the abstracts which were not included in the synthesis, with GPT-4 producing such rationales more often than Mistral. Occasionally, some rationales contained justifications relating to content more specific than just the topics, suggesting more information on the results or the methodology of the studies would improve it.\nThe LLMs seemed to show the greatest discrepancy between rating and rationale, and the greatest inconsistencies, in their evaluations of trust. In one Mistral evaluation with a rating of 5, the rationale noted that the citations only improved trustworthiness \"as long as the abstract accurately represents the study's findings.\" In the absence of any evidence the abstract is suspect, this rating is disproportionately low. GPT-4 was notably more conservative than human annotators, as it did not give a single 10. Especially for trust, it was often difficult to understand why a rating wasn't higher. For instance, the rationale for one rating of 8 praised the synthesis for accuracy and avoiding unsupported claims.\nFor the utility ratings, it appears that most rationales from GPT-4 suggested additional content which could make the synthesis more useful, such as actionable information, more detailed examples, technical details of methodologies and implementation, and so on. Mistral made such suggestions less frequently; its rationales tended to echo the rationale for comprehensive. However, Mistral did sometimes provide guidance on who would or would not find the synthesis useful."}, {"title": "Qualitative Evaluations", "content": "LLMs are known to sometimes generate content on topics that lack factual basis with a highly persuasive level of linguistic proficiency (Bang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). For scientific syntheses which provide an answer to a question, it is especially important that the content is genuinely a synthesis of the provided abstracts, with appropriate citations, and not independently generated based on the LLM's training data. For this reason, we were particularly interested in how the LLMs evaluated quality, and most importantly trust, when there was reason to believe the abstracts were not the (primary) source of the generated content, as in the following three scenarios. The complete question and answer pairs, along with their GPT-4 and Mistral evaluation scores and trust rationales, can be found in Appendix D.\nResponse Explicitly States Absence of Relevant Abstracts. In six cases, the synthesis directly expressed limitations due to the relevancy of the provided abstracts, e.g. \u201c[...] the provided search results do not offer specific information on the long-term health impacts of such medications on these organs.\" Human annotators responded very positively to this, with such responses \u201cscored highly for trustworthiness\" (Pride et al., 2023). Mistral rated four of these syntheses as 10 for trust, citing factual accuracy and abstract sourcing, while two"}, {"title": "Correlation", "content": "Spearman's \\( \\rho \\) was calculated to assess the relationship between the human annotators' scores and the LLM-generated scores. Using the publicly-available data from CORE-GPT (Pride et al., 2023)\u00b9, separate vectors for each annotator were obtained. To calculate the correlations, we found the overall mean score for each domain; due to the format of the published data, it was not possible to match individual scores to their corresponding syntheses. Our results for the overall mean are presented in Table 1.\nWe find that only two results showed statistically significant p-values. Human annotators exhibited a strong positive correlation (0.710), as did GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral (0.786). However, correlations between annotators and LLMs were weak or very weak, with p-values indicating insufficient evidence for genuine association. These findings suggest LLMs cannot directly replicate human performance in evaluating scientific syntheses. Despite this, the strong positive correlation between GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral indicates consistency between the two LLMs."}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "We explore the capacity of LLMs in assessing scientific syntheses. GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral are utilized to obtain quality ratings for 100 syntheses from the CORE-GPT dataset (Pride et al., 2023), accompanied by a rationale for each rating. Correlation analysis using Spearman's \\( \\rho \\) indicates that the LLM performance does not align with the human annotators' judgements. However, a qualitative evaluation of the responses finds a more mixed result.\nBoth LLMs generally produce credible and logically consistent ratings and rationales, but GPT-4 appears more conservative in its ratings and provides more detail and specific recommendations in its rationales. GPT-4 also displays greater sensitivity to the presence or absence of citations compared to Mistral. However, both LLMs' rationales occasionally contained inaccuracies or flaws, raising concerns about the credibility of their scores. Moreover, the extent to which the responses are evaluated as syntheses and not simply as answers, without reliance on general knowledge, remains unclear, particularly in the case of Mistral.\nOur findings highlight both promising developments and current limitations of leveraging LLMs for the task of evaluating scientific syntheses, illustrating the need for further research to validate and refine the methodology."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "We acknowledge several limitations that may influence the interpretation and generalizability of our findings. First, the reliance on a single, relatively small dataset presents limitations in terms of data representativeness. Moreover, the data format necessitated aggregating scores, which may have obscured potential nuances in individual annotations.\nSecond, the study focused exclusively on GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral, limiting the generalizability of our conclusions to other LLMs. While these models represent the state-of-the-art, future iterations or alternative architectures may exhibit different performance. Additionally, we were able to obtain only one set of ratings from each LLM. Given the variability of LLM output, taking the average of several runs is preferable, but due to financial limitations, this was not possible in our study.\nWe note that past work has found LLMs particularly adept at evaluating creative texts (Wang et al., 2023), so the narrow output scope of synthesis for scientific question answering may pose a greater challenge. We also note the difficulty of assessing the quality of syntheses from such a diverse assortment of domains. Judging how comprehensive a synthesis is requires some knowledge of the scope of potential information which might be appropriate to include. Highly specialized domain knowledge still presents a challenge to general use LLMs."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations", "content": "In this work we have presented our study of the efficacy of two LLMs, one proprietary and one open-source, in evaluating the quality of scientific syntheses.

PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES: TECHNOLOGICAL\nPROGRESS IN OBJECT TRACKING ALGORITHMS", "content": "In recent years, the convergence of computer vision and machine learning has transformed object tracking, paving the way for more sophisticated and adaptive systems. These ad-vancements are underpinned by breakthroughs in deep learn-ing architectures, which have enabled models to capture in-tricate motion patterns and dependencies from vast datasets. Consequently, object tracking systems now demonstrate greater accuracy, robustness, and generalizability across a wide variety of applications [122], [114], [242]. One do-main that has particularly benefited from these innovations is biomedical image analysis, where object tracking has proven vital in tasks such as cell segmentation, motion tracking, and anomaly detection within video microscopy.\nThe infusion of deep learning into tracking systems has led to the development of more autonomous methods, especially through the utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs, known for their exceptional ability to capture spatial features, have revolutionized object detection and tracking in dense, cluttered environments. They can automatically extract rel-evant features from raw video data, reducing the need for extensive human intervention. RNNs, on the other hand, ex-cel at modeling temporal dependencies across video frames, allowing tracking systems to better predict and maintain object trajectories over time, especially in highly dynamic scenes. This synergy between CNNs and RNNs has been the backbone of many high-performance tracking models that excel in handling challenges like occlusion, variable motion patterns, and changes in object appearance over time.\nMore recently, the integration of transformer-based ar-chitectures has pushed the boundaries of object tracking even further. These architectures, initially designed for nat-ural language processing, have shown significant promise in tracking applications by modeling long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs. Research presented at CVPR 2023 highlights the superior ability of transformers to handle complex multi-object tracking (MOT) scenarios, where multiple objects need to be tracked across varied domains and scales [243].

FROM FRAMES TO FLOW: THE ART AND SCIENCE\nOF OBJECT TRACKING", "content": "Video processing involves the analysis and manipulation of a sequence of time-varying images, with each image, or frame, representing a snapshot in time. These video signals can be analog or digital, but in modern computer vision and video analysis, digital signals are favored due to their superior precision, flexibility, and seamless integration with automated systems [1]. In essence, a digital video is a series of still images, where each frame is composed of pixels. These pixels, the fundamental building blocks of an image, represent varying intensity levels of light, and their spatial arrangement forms the visual structure of each frame.\nThe process of capturing these images, known as imag-ing, is pivotal in video analysis across multiple domains, from security systems [175] to cellular biology [42]. Unlike static images, videos introduce a temporal component, where pixel intensity values change over time, necessitating the use of advanced video processing techniques. These techniques enable the modification, quantification, and mathematical interpretation of thousands of sequential images, a task that requires sophisticated digital image processing tools [37], [38].\nIn the biomedical field, video processing serves as a criti-cal tool for tracking the movement and interactions of biolog-ical entities such as cells and pathogens. The dynamic nature of biological systems, including the behavior of subcellular structures like mitochondria and microtubules, makes video analysis indispensable for understanding cellular functions and disease mechanisms [139], [140]. Through the precise analysis of motion and interactions, video processing can uncover key insights into biological processes that static imaging methods simply cannot capture.\nRecent advancements in machine learning, particularly ar-tificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, have dramatically improved video processing capabilities. These AI-driven techniques have been seamlessly integrated into video analy-sis pipelines, enhancing the accuracy of critical tasks such as motion detection, object tracking, and scene understanding [116], [117].

In medical diagnostics, these advancements have been particularly transformative, enabling the auto-mated analysis of complex biological activities that were previously too intricate for manual interpretation. AI models, trained on extensive video sequences of cellular activities, can detect subtle changes and anomalies that may indicate the early onset of diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. This early detection capability facilitates timely diagnosis, which in turn enables more effective treatment interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes [116], [117].\nMoreover, AI-driven automation significantly reduces the workload for human analysts, making the analysis of large datasets not only feasible but also more efficient. In fields such as pathology, where vast quantities of video data are generated daily, manual analysis can be overwhelming and prone to human error. Al models alleviate this burden by processing and analyzing the data rapidly, allowing for real-time insights and high-throughput diagnostic workflows. This level of automation is crucial for scalability in modern medical research and clinical settings, where both speed and precision are essential.\nAnother compelling example of AI's impact in medical diagnostics and biomedical research can be found in the field of ophthalmology, particularly in glaucoma research. The integration of unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods has proven highly effective in the phenotyping of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, as demonstrated by Kazeminasab et al.

This task involves detecting the object in consecutive frames and associating the detections to form a coherent temporal trajectory. Object tracking is pivotal in deriving metrics such as an object's texture, area, and motion model, all of which describe its behavior over time. Depending on the complexity of the video and the application, object tracking can be applied to either single or multiple objects.\nTracking becomes particularly challenging due to factors such as object appearance variations, occlusions, and com-plex background environments. Objects may change shape, fade away, or move in unpredictable trajectories, compli-cating the task for tracking algorithms. Furthermore, ob-ject classification into rigid (e.g., cars, balls) and non-rigid (e.g., humans, animals) categories is crucial for selecting the appropriate algorithm. Non-rigid object tracking requires sophisticated models capable of handling deformable shapes and dynamic environments."}, {"title": "1) Significance of Temporal Analysis in Object Tracking", "content": "Temporal analysis is essential in object tracking, allowing models to capture the continuity of an object's motion over time. Conventional methods, such as optical flow, estimate an object's trajectory based on pixel movement between consecutive frames but are often limited in handling long-term dependencies, occlusions, and abrupt motion changes. Probabilistic methods like Kalman filters and particle filters offer predictive capabilities by estimating an object's future positions based on past observations, yet these methods still struggle with more complex dynamics and high-dimensional data [244].\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) introduced memory into temporal analysis by maintaining hidden states that store previous time-step information. However, RNNs suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients, which limit their ability to capture long-range dependencies [245]. This challenge was addressed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use gates to regulate the flow of information and retain important data over extended time periods, making them more effective for long-sequence tracking [246], [247].\nIn recent years, transformer models have replaced LSTMs in temporal analysis tasks due to their self-attention mecha-nisms. Unlike RNNs and LSTMs, transformers process entire sequences in parallel, making them highly efficient and scal-able for large datasets. Transformers such as DETR (DEtec-tion TRansformers) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) have demonstrated their ability to model both spatial and temporal dependencies effectively, even in complex environ-ments [178], [248], [249].

This structure allows the network to retain important data over long time spans and discard irrelevant information. LSTMs have been widely used in tasks requiring both short- and long-term dependency modeling, such as time series forecasting, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP).

OBJECT DETECTION", "content": "Object detection plays a crucial role in object tracking by identifying and localizing objects within each frame of a video. It often involves segmenting moving objects from a static or dynamic background, producing pixel-wise masks that delineate the boundaries of each object [43]. Segmenta-tion techniques such as watershed segmentation and k-means clustering are commonly employed in biomedical imaging to separate objects based on distinct characteristics like color, intensity, or texture. Additionally, modern deep learning methods like You Only Look Once (YOLO), Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), and Mask R-CNN have gained popularity for real-time object detection and segmentation tasks. These approaches are particularly useful when objects may appear or disappear within a video, neces-sitating continuous detection and segmentation for accurate tracking.\nIn biomedical applications, object detection faces several challenges, such as variations in object appearance caused by changes in viewpoint, occlusions, background clutter, and inconsistent lighting conditions [46]. The complexity of biological samples, which often contain visually similar ob-jects, further complicates detection. Despite these challenges, advancements in machine learning and computer vision have led to the development of robust object detection methods that can handle these complexities.\nDeep learning-based models, such as those utilizing Con-volutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have significantly im-proved the accuracy and robustness of detection in complex environments [160], [161].

The idea is to flood this surface from the lowest elevation points, treating bright regions as ridges and dark regions as valleys. The process involves filling the valleys (or basins) with water, and as the water rises, separate basins merge along the watershed lines, which are used to define object boundaries.\nIn biomedical imaging, watershed segmentation is partic-ularly useful for separating overlapping or closely packed objects, such as touching cells in microscopy images [152]. For example, in histopathological images, where individual cells often cluster tightly together, watershed segmentation can isolate each cell by detecting the boundaries between them.\nHowever, the algorithm is highly sensitive to noise and gradient variations, which can lead to over-segmentation. To mitigate these issues, pre-processing steps like filtering, edge detection, or the use of markers are commonly ap-plied.

The process iteratively refines the cluster assignments until the variance within each cluster is minimized.\nIn biomedical imaging, k-means clustering is used to sepa-rate distinct regions, such as tissues, cells, or other structures in medical scans. One key application is in magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, where the algorithm can be used to differentiate between tissues with different intensity values, such as distinguishing tumors from surrounding healthy tissues.

Known as color histogram-based tracking, this ap-proach uses the distribution of colors within a target region as a distinctive signature for tracking.\nThe work of McKenna et al. pioneered the use of color histograms in face tracking, demonstrating their effectiveness in distinguishing and following faces in video sequences [1]. Since then, color-based tracking has expanded to a variety of objects beyond facial tracking."}, {"title": "2) Kernel-based Tracking", "content": "Kernel-based tracking methods, often implemented through the mean-shift algorithm, focus on representing and localiz-ing objects. These methods utilize an isotropic kernel func-tion to create a spatial representation of the target, transform-ing the localization problem into an iterative search process. The goal is to maximize the"}]}

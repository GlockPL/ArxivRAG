Stratopoulos", "Victor Xiaoqi Wang"], "abstract": "This paper provides a review of recent publications and working papers on ChatGPT and related Large Language Models (LLMs) in accounting and finance. The aim is to understand the current state of research in these two areas and identify potential research opportunities for future inquiry. We identify three common themes from these earlier studies. The first theme focuses on applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in various fields of accounting and finance. The second theme utilizes ChatGPT and LLMs as a new research tool by leveraging their capabilities such as classification, summarization, and text generation. The third theme investigates implications of LLM adoption for accounting and finance professionals, as well as for various organizations and sectors. While these earlier studies provide valuable insights, they leave many important questions unanswered or partially addressed. We propose venues for further exploration and provide technical guidance for researchers seeking to employ ChatGPT and related LLMs as a tool for their research.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the summer of 2022, The Economist (2022) described Large Language Models (LLMs) - like OpenAI's GPT-3 - as uncanny\u00b9 due to their capability to generate human language, which up to that point was considered the pinnacle of intelligence (Wolfram 2023). In less than a year, OpenAI introduced two major updates: GPT-3.5 on November 30, 2022, and GPT-4 on March 14, 2023.\u00b2 Unlike previous technologies designed to automate routine and repetitive tasks, this new technology can potentially replace workers in highly educated, well-compensated white-collar occupations. The most advanced LLMs have exhibited characteristics of general-purpose technologies, suggesting they could bring about significant economic, social, and policy ramifications (Eloundou et al. 2023). These developments have sparked heated discussions within various industries, including accounting and finance, and an unprecedented adoption rate. Gartner predicts over 80% enterprise adoption by 2026, a sharp spike from 5% in 2023 (Cooney 2023). In comparison, enterprise systems and cloud computing took approximately eight and six years, respectively, to achieve a 15% adoption rate (Stratopoulos and Wang 2022).\nThe repercussions of ChatGPT and other LLMs are keenly felt in academic circles. In a relatively short period (from January 2022 to March 2024), 264 papers related to ChatGPT and other LLMs were uploaded to SSRN within the Accounting, Finance, or Economics networks. Given the surge in scholarly activity and the vital importance of this emerging technology, it becomes imperative to synthesize and analyze this burgeoning body of work. Our literature review serves multiple purposes. First, it seeks to capture the current state of the art in LLM-related research in accounting and finance. Synthesizing current studies provides practitioners and researchers valuable insights into the latest developments and applications. Second, it aims to identify gaps in the existing literature. By critically evaluating existing studies, this review pinpoints areas where further research opportunities are fruitful and abundant. Lastly, this review critically assesses the methodologies researchers employ using LLMs as research tools and offers guidance on appropriately and effectively leveraging these models while avoiding potential pitfalls.\nTraditionally, literature reviews synthesize well-established and published bodies of knowledge. However, as highlighted earlier, the unprecedented pace of technological advancement necessitates a shift in our approach. Rather than solely reflecting on where the research has been, we must adopt a forward-looking perspective that aligns with the famous adage, \"Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\" In this context, our review covers published works and working papers on SSRN. While published works remain valuable, they often lag behind the cutting-edge developments reflected in working papers. By synthesizing insights from published works and working papers, our analysis captures the dynamic landscape of ChatGPT's role in accounting and finance. This comprehensive approach"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "2.1 LLMs\nAn LLM is a machine learning model trained to understand, generate, and interact with human language. The label \"large\" comes from the fact that such models have an enormous number of parameters, often on the order of billions or even trillions. For example, GPT-3 from OpenAI has 175 billion parameters, whereas its more advanced successor, GPT-4, is estimated to have 1.76 trillion parameters. A parameter can be understood as a coefficient learned and tuned during"}, {"title": "2.2 GPT Models from OpenAI", "content": "OpenAI developed a series of LLMs based on its GPT architecture. Table 2 summarizes these models, including their release dates, number of parameters, and context windows. OpenAI introduced GPT-1, its first transformer-based LLM, in June 2018. With 117 million parameters, this model was trained on a large corpus of publicly available text from the Internet and could perform various tasks, such as textual alignment, sentiment analysis, and semantic similarity analysis. As an improved iteration of GPT-1, GPT-2 could generate coherent text sequences and human-like responses to prompts. However, GPT-2 did not perform well at tasks that required more complex reasoning and/or understanding of the context. These limitations led to the development of GPT-3, demonstrating the ability to perform a wide array of language tasks with little to no task-specific training. It can generate text that is contextually rich and often indistinguishable from human-generated writing. Despite these achievements, GPT-3 still exhibits limitations, such as generating factually incorrect information (a phenomenon known as hallucination) and lacking a true understanding of the text it processes.\nThe GPT-3.5 series became widely known when ChatGPT was released in November 2022. This news series builds upon its predecessor by offering enhanced coherence for longer passages, improved contextual understanding for nuanced prompts, refined tone and style adoption, reduced hallucinations and misinformation, and improved instruction following. On November 28, 2022, OpenAI unveiled an enhanced iteration of its GPT model, dubbed \"text-davinci-003,\" building upon the previous \"text-davinci-002\" model. As of November 30, 2022, both models were categorized by OpenAI under the \"GPT-3.5\" series. Concurrently, on that day, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, an application driven by a model also finetuned for instruction following \"text-davinci-002,\" making that model another member of the GPT-3.5 series.\nOn March 14, 2023, OpenAI launched GPT-4, which has a much larger context window of 8,192 tokens and is believed to have more than 1.7 trillion parameters. GPT-4 can take text,"}, {"title": "2.3 ChatGPT", "content": "The term \u201cChatGPT\u201d commonly refers to the chatbot application created by OpenAI and the underlying models that drive its capabilities. ChatGPT became immensely popular after its release, reaching one million users in five days. In comparison, it took Instagram 2.5 months to acquire the same number of users. Currently, ChatGPT has 180.5 million users. As shown in Figure 1, public interest in ChatGPT is still upward. The Google Trends data also indicates that the general interest in LLMs is not even a fraction of the interest garnered by ChatGPT.\nThe ChatGPT web interface is easy to use and provides an intuitive way to interact with the model behind it. In addition to the free web access to GPT-3.5, OpenAI provides a free playground where users can try various models. GPT-4 is also available via Microsoft's Bing Chat, rebranded as Copilot as of November 2023. However, API is the preferred option for most researchers, especially when processing large datasets. In the appendix, we provide guidance on some of the technical aspects regarding the use of the API."}, {"title": "III. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY", "content": "In assessing the extant literature, researchers opt for one of two primary review methodologies: a systematic review or a scoping/mapping review (Par\u00e9 et al. 2015; Yang Li et al. 2018). A systematic review is commonly employed to synthesize established literature on a well-"}, {"title": "3.1 Framework and Research Questions", "content": "We develop our framework for organizing and evaluating the studies in our sample by drawing on two streams of research, namely, literature review studies on the adoption of emerging technologies (Yang Li et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2023) and studies on how the state of adoption of an emerging technology influences the type of research that is done or can be done (O'Leary 2008; 2009). Given that ChatGPT is one of the applications of an emerging technology (i.e., Generative AI), we propose a framework that builds on approaches used in recent literature reviews related to the adoption of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and AI (Yang Li et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2023). This means that at a high level, studies can be organized using an input-process-output approach (Lee et al. 2023). Under this approach, input relates to motivation for the adoption of new technology or the focus area of application; process relates to how the technology is used, what challenges, difficulties, and problems are involved, and what guidelines and best practices are recommended or available; finally, output relates to the implications of widespread adoption of the technology.\nWe complement the input-process-output approach by incorporating evidence from the current stage of LLM adoption. According to O'Leary (2008), the stage of technology adoption determines the type of academic research that can be (is) done. Using the Gartner Hype Cycle (Fenn and Raskino 2008) as a proxy for technology adoption, O'Leary argues that researchers will try to educate themselves about the emerging technology during the early stages when little is known regarding how it works and their capabilities. Over time, as the technology matures and becomes mainstream, we will start seeing large-scale empirical studies focusing on the financial, market, and competitive payoffs from adoption. Combining the insights from these two"}, {"title": "3.1.1 Input: Motivation & Focus Areas", "content": "In the technology adoption literature (Rogers 1995), adoption starts with mavericks who can visualize how the new technology could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their work or their organizations. Extending this logic to accounting and finance research, we argue that researchers who have produced research papers in our sample are those who can visualize the application of LLMs in accounting and finance fields (e.g., financial reporting, audit, and asset pricing). This is consistent with O'Leary (2008), who argues that studies at the early adoption stage will tend to emphasize the positive aspects of the new technology. Therefore, a systematic analysis of the foci of these studies would serve as a proxy for the areas where researchers identify the initial, most accessible opportunities for applying LLMs in accounting and finance.\nFor this purpose, we first outline the key areas of interest by drawing on the major research areas recognized by the American Accounting Association and American Finance Association, as shown in Table 4. Focusing on motivation and strategic research areas, our framework provides a holistic view of the initial considerations and objectives shaping the use of LLMs in accounting and finance. This also allows us to see the state of the art, gaps, and opportunities for future research in each accounting and finance area."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Process: How/Capabilities", "content": "From the process perspective, we examine the specific capabilities of LLMs that researchers leverage in their work. We start by asking ChatGPT 4.0 what capabilities it possesses. At the prompt of \"What are you capable of doing?\u201d ChatGPT generates the following list:\n\u2022\tAnswering Questions\n\u2022\tData Analysis and Assistance\n\u2022\tLanguage Tasks\n\u2022\tProgramming and Coding Help\n\u2022\tCreative Content Generation\n\u2022\tEducation and Learning\n\u2022\tGeneral Guidance and Advice\nWe need to dive deeper into these capabilities to organize the research papers systematically. While ChatGPT's array of functions provides a broad foundation, our study requires a more focused approach tailored to the unique demands of accounting and finance research. For instance, \u201cLanguage Tasks\u201d is one of the many capabilities of ChatGPT, encompassing translation, grammar checks, writing assistance, and summarization, among others. While these are broadly useful in the context of accounting and finance research (Korinek 2023), some of them are notably more relevant than others, e.g., summarization, which aids in extracting key points from lengthy narratives commonly found in corporate disclosures (A. G. Kim, Muhn, and Nikolaev 2023a). To this end, we propose organizing the capabilities of ChatGPT as follows, each ranked by its complexity and practical application in accounting and finance research:\n(1) Word embedding generation. \n(2) Information retrieval.\n(3) Question-answering (basic) \u2013 basic accounting and finance concepts.\n(4) Classification and sentiment analysis. \n(5) Question-answering (advanced) \u2013 application of accounting and finance concepts to complex scenarios.\n(6) Text/code generation.\n(7) Summarization.\n(8) Predictions.\n(9) Decision aid by providing recommendations using logical reasoning.\nThis ranking mirrors the stages and complexity of data analytics, progressing from data management to descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics (Stratopoulos 2018). For example, word embeddings generation and information retrieval represent the initial data collection/management stage, which is essential for subsequent analysis. Classification and sentiment analysis echo diagnostic analytics, as they make it possible to extract deeper insights from data, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of financial narratives. Lastly, capabilities like predictions and logical reasoning are akin to the advanced stages of predictive and prescriptive analytics, where the focus shifts to forecasting future trends and formulating strategic recommendations based on the analyzed data. Understanding the nuances of the process (i.e., capabilities used and their complexity ranking) is important for gaining insights into the"}, {"title": "3.1.3 Output: Adoption Maturity & Implications", "content": "For the output perspective, we analyze the outcomes reported in studies leveraging ChatGPT and similar LLMs in accounting and finance. To distinguish between expected outcomes (where LLMs are used in controlled environments) and actual outcomes (where their intended user base adopts LLMs), we propose the following four groups based on implied adoption maturity (i.e., the stage in the adoption cycle):\n(1) Based on general theories and practices, conceptual papers represent the researchers' conceptualization and visualization of how the technologies can be applied and how to apply them best.\n(2) Case studies from early adopters of the technology.\n(3) Potential applications explore how the technology could be used by demonstrating its capability through large-scale experiments or designing a framework that guides the application of the technology in a specific field.\n(4) Value realization studies assess the actual impact of technology adoption on organizations and professions. They examine whether integrating the technology has created tangible value for users and organizations.\nMapping these studies into groups of different adoption maturity helps capture the unique aspects of LLMs and their evolving impact over time. Initially, as observed by O'Leary (2008), the adoption of emerging technologies tends to be low, leading to early studies that are conceptual and exploratory, often centered on pilot projects within individual firms. However, with the Economist (2023a) predicting that \u201cGenerative AI will go mainstream in 2024,\u201d we expect a quicker transition to large-scale empirical studies. These studies will provide insights into the financial and market implications of LLMs, reflecting the evolving nature of this technology.\nAnother facet of the Output perspective concerns the impact of LLMs on education and the labor market. Several studies have highlighted the potential effects of LLMs on students' future earnings (Huseynov 2023). Coupled with a multitude of studies on the impact of LLMs on white-collar jobs and their broader implications for the labor market, it becomes imperative to review studies that investigate the implications and impacts of LLMs specifically for and on the accounting and finance sectors. This comprehensive approach is necessary to understand the broader implications of LLMs in our domain. By synthesizing these diverse studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive and nuanced view of how LLMs are transforming educational and professional landscapes and redefining the future trajectory of accounting and finance."}, {"title": "3.2 Literature Search and Selection", "content": "A literature review on an emerging technology aims to create initial conceptualizations and theoretical models rather than examine old ones. Thus, \u201cthis type of review often requires a more creative data collection\u201d (Snyder 2019, 336). We endeavor to capture this preliminary"}, {"title": "3.3 Descriptive Statistics", "content": "Figure 2 depicts the timeline when the working papers were initially uploaded to SSRN. The activity started in late 2022 and has since experienced significant growth, peaking with a notable surge in Spring 2023, followed by some fluctuations after that. The observed pattern from the monthly distribution of uploads is consistent with the unfolding of key developments in LLMs, particularly the release of ChatGPT 3.5 on November 30, 2022, and ChatGPT 4.0 on March 14, 2023."}, {"title": "IV. SYNTHESIS OF EXTANT LITERATURE", "content": "4.1 Input Phase: Applications of ChatGPT in Accounting\nPractical applications of a new technology start with an awareness and understanding of its functions and capabilities. Researchers can play a significant role in facilitating the widespread adoption of new technologies by demystifying them and envisioning their practical applications. Consistent with the observation of O'Leary (2008), during the early stages, numerous studies aim to educate readers about ChatGPT and LLMs in general. These studies describe and demonstrate their capabilities and explore their potential applications in various accounting fields, such as financial reporting, audit, and tax. For example, Zhao and Wang (2023) discuss the prospective applications of ChatGPT across diverse accounting tasks. Similarly, Street, Wilck, and Chism (2023) encourage CPAs to improve their productivity by experimenting with LLMs for language generation tasks and provide some general principles for safely and effectively doing so. Two studies, Fotoh and Mugwira (2023) and Street and Wilck (2023), provide domain-specific guidelines. The former discusses the potential benefits, pitfalls, and ethical considerations of integrating ChatGPT into external audits, while the latter introduces ChatGPT to forensic accounting professionals.\nAccording to these studies, ChatGPT holds the potential to reshape various accounting processes by automating routine, mundane tasks that require modest professional judgment. Such tasks may include drafting various documents, ranging from internal memos to correspondence with audit or tax clients. LLMs can offer valuable assistance to CPAs working at firms more constrained in resources, helping to address staff shortages exacerbated by the profession's diminishing appeal to new talent (Boritz and Stratopoulos 2023).\nHowever, these potential benefits do not come without risks. The risks or challenges include output accuracy, data security, client privacy, integration complexities, accountability, and intellectual property rights. As such, the authors of these studies urge accounting professionals to maintain a high level of vigilance over these risks. Additionally, the authors caution accounting professionals against an over-reliance on these new technological tools, warning that such over-dependence could potentially undermine their critical thinking skills. Consistent with the findings of Dell'Acqua et al. (2023), they recommend that CPAs exercise professional skepticism and use LLMs to enhance rather than replace their expertise."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Auditing", "content": "Audit literature explores the role and effectiveness of audits in enhancing financial statement reliability (audit quality). Major themes include auditor independence, audit risk assessment, internal control evaluation, and ethical challenges in maintaining professional integrity amid regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market pressures (e.g., DeFond and Zhang 2014; Roussy and Perron 2018).\nWhile these studies provide valuable insights into the potential applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in the auditing domain, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations and gaps that warrant further exploration. The generalizability of these findings across different jurisdictions and audit types remains a pertinent question, necessitating further research to explore the adaptability and scalability of LLMs in auditing practices globally. Moreover, future studies should investigate the impact of ChatGPT and LLMs on audit quality and ethical challenges in maintaining professional integrity in Generative AI-assisted auditing. Overall, the new research aligns with the growing discourse on digital transformation in auditing, challenging traditional methodologies and advocating for reevaluating the auditor's role in the face of technological advancements."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Financial Accounting and Reporting", "content": "The financial accounting and reporting literature focuses on the development and application of accounting standards, financial statement preparation and presentation, the quality and transparency of financial reporting, the use of accounting information for decision-making (e.g., its impact on capital markets), and the role of ethics and governance in financial reporting and disclosure. Researchers in this area also examine the impacts of technological advancements, sustainability concerns, and globalization on financial accounting and reporting practices (e.g., Barth, Landsman, and Lang 2008; Beyer et al. 2010; Eccles and Krzus 2010; Zeff 2013).\nLLMs are well suited for analyzing unstructured textual information, making them valuable for examining various disclosures and reports. As shown in Table 10, LLMs, like ChatGPT, can be leveraged to enhance various aspects of financial reporting, from improving transparency and information quality to aiding in compliance with sustainability disclosures and understanding managerial incentives. The findings suggest that integrating these language models into financial reporting processes can lead to more efficient and informed decision-making by investors and other stakeholders."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Taxation", "content": "Taxation literature encompasses tax policy and system design, taxpayer behavior (including compliance, evasion, and tax planning), the impact of taxation on business decisions, and the role of tax incentives. It also examines tax accounting and reporting, the equity and efficiency of tax systems, and the interplay between taxation and economic growth. Researchers have also explored the influence of globalization, digitalization, and sustainability on tax systems and policies (e.g., Hanlon and Heitzman 2010; Devereux and Vella 2014). Despite this broad scope, the application of LLMs in this field has been limited, presenting enormous opportunities for future research.\nChoi and Kim (2023) use GPT-4 to analyze tax-audit-related narrative disclosures and construct a novel firm-level measure that captures tax audit periods. They find that tax audits effectively deter firms' tax avoidance, with the effect lingering even after the audits conclude. However, they also document negative firm-level economic consequences of tax audits, such as reduced capital expenditures, increased stock volatility, and decreased debt market access, suggesting that tax audits are an additional source of corporate risk. Two other studies (Alarie et al. 2023; L. Zhang 2023) explicitly focus on tax professionals. These authors test the ability of LLMs to answer tax-related questions and caution tax professionals about the limitations of these models. Alarie et al. (2023) compare the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and Blue J (a proprietary LLM trained on tax data), demonstrating the superiority of Blue J over ChatGPT. One caveat is that the authors of this study are employees of the company that develops and markets Blue J."}, {"title": "4.1.4 Accounting Information Systems (AIS)", "content": "AIS literature focuses on the design, implementation, and management of systems that collect, process, and report financial information. Key themes include the integration of technology with accounting processes, the role of AIS in enhancing decision-making and internal controls, data security and privacy issues, and the impact of emerging technologies on accounting practices. It also examines the challenges and benefits of system adoption (Sutton 2010).\nGiven the predicted exponential growth in enterprise adoption of LLMs (Cooney 2023; Economist 2023a), several studies have examined their role within organizational IT infrastructure and AIS systems. O'Leary (2022; 2023a; 2023b) compared common LLMs and discussed emerging issues, characteristics, risks, and limitations of their enterprise adoption. From a systems development perspective, Beerbaum (2023) and Li and Vasarhelyi (2023) propose integrating LLMs into Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to enhance accounting productivity and efficiency. These technologies can automate routine tasks, allowing accountants to focus on more judgmental work, thus demonstrating the potential for Generative AI-powered tools to transform accounting practices."}, {"title": "4.2 Input: Applications of ChatGPT in Finance", "content": "Numerous studies argue that LLMs have the potential to transform the way financial professionals do their daily work, given their capabilities of understanding intricate patterns and automating routines and even certain complex processes. Treating ChatGPT as a domain-specific expert is a common method used to visualize the scope and applications of this form of new technology (O'Leary 2008). For example, Zaremba and Demir (2023) explore the applications of ChatGPT in finance and their potential for enhancing NLP-based financial analysis. In multiple related studies, Krause (2023a; 2023b; 2023d) explores the benefits of applying generative AI to finance, ranging from improved operational efficiency to enhanced analytical accuracy. Aldridge (2023) showcases the advantages of AI technologies such as ChatGPT, emphasizing their superior signal extraction capabilities and highlighting their potential for sophisticated financial analysis and forecasting. However, the benefits that ChatGPT can bring to the finance field come with potential risks and other challenges. These may include information inaccuracy, privacy and security concerns, opacity in decision-making processes, labor displacement, and legal considerations (Khan and Umer 2023)."}, {"title": "4.2.1 Asset Pricing & Investment", "content": "Asset pricing and investment literature focuses on the valuation of financial assets, the determinants of asset returns, financial market behavior, and investment strategies. Key themes include developing and testing asset pricing models, the impact of risk factors and market anomalies on asset prices, the role of investor behavior and sentiment in financial decision-making, and the influence of macroeconomic variables on investment performance. The literature also examines portfolio management strategies, market efficiency, and the implications of behavioral finance for asset pricing and investment (e.g., Brunnermeier et al. 2021; Cochrane 2005).\nAs shown in Table 13, numerous studies highlight how LLMs can be leveraged to enhance return predictability by extracting signals (like sentiment) from corporate disclosures. These models can also support portfolio management, financial advising, and other investment decision-making processes. The findings suggest that integrating LLMs in these areas can lead to more accurate predictions, improved investment outcomes, and data-driven decision-making for investors, portfolio managers, and financial advisors. However, the studies also underscore the importance of addressing potential challenges, such as biases, regulatory uncertainties, and the need for a balanced approach in adopting these technologies."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Corporate Finance", "content": "Corporate finance literature primarily examines how firms make financial decisions and interact with capital markets. Key themes include capital structure decisions, such as the trade-offs between debt and equity financing, as well as investment and dividend policies.

Additionally, the literature addresses agency conflict issues and the implications of financial regulations (e.g., Tirole 2010)."}, {"title": "4.2.3 Risk Management", "content": "Risk management literature primarily focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating various risks to enhance organizational stability and performance. It explores the impact of behavioral factors on risk perception and decision-making, the integration of risk management into corporate strategy, and the influence of emerging risks, such as cybersecurity threats, climate-related risks, and technological disruptions (e.g., Bromiley et al. 2015; Nocco and Stulz 2006)."}, {"title": "4.3 Process: How ChatGPT is Used in Accounting and Finance Research", "content": "A large number of studies employ ChatGPT and related LLMs as research tools. This is not surprising since a significant amount of information provided by or available to accounting/finance professionals comes in the form of unstructured textual data. With their powerful capabilities in NLP, LLMs offer new tools that enable researchers to analyze and draw insights from such textual data. Despite the growing number of studies using ChatGPT as a research tool, ChatGPT and other LLMs are still relatively new to most researchers in the field.\nDe Kok (2023) proposes a framework for using LLMs such as ChatGPT for textual analysis, focusing on accounting and finance but applicable to other fields. The framework covers model selection, prompt engineering, and validity testing. However, researchers should adapt these guidelines to their specific projects, as LLMs are a rapidly evolving technology that presents ongoing challenges in various research contexts. Several studies explore and propose ways in which LLMs can be used to enhance research productivity for researchers in economics, finance, and other related disciplines (Cao and Zhai 2023; Dowling and Lucey 2023; Feng, Hu, and Li 2023; Korinek 2023). Illustrated using ChatGPT, these studies provide use cases ranging from ideation and literature review to data analysis, coding, and mathematical derivation. The consensus seems that LLMs excel in idea generation and data identification, but they exhibit"}, {"title": "4.3.1 Word Embeddings", "content": "Word embeddings are mathematical representations of words or tokens as real-valued vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing intricate semantic relationships between them. LLMs use context-dependent word embeddings, wherein the representation of a word depends on its context, thus better capturing the nuanced meanings of and intricate relations between words. As described in the background section, word embeddings are part of the parameters within an LLM and are learned during the training process. Pre-trained LLMs can be used to generate word embeddings.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that word embeddings generated by LLMs can outperform traditional methods in various downstream tasks in accounting and finance. Breitung and M\u00fcller (2023) introduce a new measure of global business networks using LLM-generated word embeddings, showing their superiority in identifying economic relationships compared to traditional industry classifications. Bandara, Flannery, and Chandak (2023) find that \"ada-002\" outperforms other models in classifying financial documents, while BERT performs best in predicting earnings surprises using word embeddings from earnings conference calls. Yang (2023) employs \"ada-002\" to generate context-dependent word embeddings for patent applications, demonstrating their greater power in predicting the economic value of patents. Pungulescu and Stolin (2024) compare BERT, GPT, and semantic fingerprinting to measure the similarity between financial documents and explain stock return correlations."}, {"title": "4.3.2 Classification", "content": "Classification involves assigning pre-defined labels to the input data based on certain characteristics or criteria. Several recent studies demonstrate the potential of ChatGPT and other LLMs for classifying textual data in accounting and finance research.\nOne common application is identifying specific topics or types of disclosures in corporate communications. For example, Li, Peng, and Yu (2023) use ChatGPT to identify ESG-related disclosures from conference call transcripts. Kuroki, Manabe, and Nakagawa (2023) use GPT-3.5-turbo to classify management presentations at earnings conference calls of Japanese companies into \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201copinions\u201d. Similarly, Jia, Li, Ma, and Xu (2024) employ GPT-4 to determine whether discussions during earnings calls refer to concrete initiatives or general remarks. Moreno and Caminero (2023) use a combination of text mining, ChatGPT, and Google's text-bison to create a Greenhouse Gas Disclosure Index based on companies' ESG reports. Choi and Kim (2023) apply GPT-4 to identify tax audit-related disclosures in annual reports and classify them into different stages. Meng Wang (2023) uses a GPT-based model to identify and classify performance attribution statements made by mutual fund managers in shareholder reports.\nBeyond simple disclosure classification, researchers are finding novel applications for using ChatGPT to assess firms' financial characteristics. For instance, Bernard et al. (2023) use GPT-3 to classify XBRL tags and construct a new measure of business complexity. Dasgupta, Li, and Wu (2023) generate a measure of financial flexibility by having ChatGPT evaluate the degree of financial constraint revealed in MD&A sections and the firm's ability to fund investment projects. Notably, F\u00f6hr, Marten, and Schreyer (2023) use ChatGPT to classify interview transcripts. This is the first paper we encountered that uses ChatGPT to process qualitative data from field studies. LLMs hold promise as a tool for assisting survey-based research that involves questionnaires (Jansen, Jung, and Salminen 2023).\nOverall, these studies highlight the significant potential of ChatGPT and similar LLMs for automating the classification of a wide variety of textual data in accounting and finance. However, researchers should be aware of limitations, such as the potential for inconsistent outputs depending on the prompts used. This is problematic in research contexts where reliability"}, {"title": "4.3.3 Sentiment Analysis", "content": "Sentiment analysis is a computational technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. This type of analysis categorizes a text as having a positive, negative, or neutral tone. Further refinement is possible by assigning numeric values to differentiate the intensity of the tone. Automatic sentiment analysis can be performed using dictionaries or ML approaches. The word list developed by Loughran and McDonald (2011) is a commonly used dictionary for analyzing text in accounting and finance. In recent years, ML-based approaches such as BERT or its fine-tuned version for finance text, i.e., FinBERT (Huang, Wang, and Yang 2023), have gained popularity.\nAs shown in Table 16, many studies employ ChatGPT and other LLMs for sentiment analysis in various contexts. These studies consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced LLMs like ChatGPT in extracting meaningful sentiment from financial texts, which can be used to forecast market movements or enhance existing financial models. Comparative analyses show that LLMs often outperform traditional methods in financial applications across different languages and markets. While highlighting the significant potential of LLMs to revolutionize financial sentiment analysis and investment decision-making, some studies also address important methodological considerations and challenges, emphasizing the need for careful implementation and domain-specific adaptations in financial applications."}, {"title": "4.3.4 Text Generation", "content": "Text generation involves the automated creation of coherent, contextually appropriate text using advanced algorithms. Generative AI models excel in this task because they are specifically designed for this task. In a practical application, Bai et al. (2023) use LLMs to quantify the extent of new information executives provide during earnings call Q&A sessions, comparing AI-generated answers with executives' responses. They consider executives to have provided little new information if their answers are highly similar to those generated by the LLMs, implicitly assuming that AI cannot provide new information beyond its training data. Wu, Dong, Li, and Shi (2023) use ChatGPT to generate analyses of textual loan assessments, comparing the AI-generated texts with the original human-generated texts. Incorporating text types alongside structured data into deep learning models significantly improves credit default predictions.

This process has historically lacked a satisfactory solution due to the complexity of accurately capturing and representing the nuances of large text bodies. However, most advanced LLMs can"}, {"title": "4.3.6 Prediction", "content": "Several studies have focused on the capability of LLMs to make predictions. Li, Tu, and Zhou (2023) find that earnings forecasts generated by GPT-4 exhibit greater forecast errors than analyst consensus, and GPT-4 tends to be more optimistic than financial analysts. Their sub-sample analyses show that GPT-4 generates more accurate forecasts for firms with better information environments or higher-quality disclosures, suggesting its ability to effectively use contextual information. Notably, GPT-4's performance is not affected by text readability, potentially indicating its superior comprehension of"}]}

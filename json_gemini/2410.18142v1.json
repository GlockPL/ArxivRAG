The outputs of these models are compared directly to those produced by graduate-level human participants. By focusing on two Nobel Prize-winning short stories, 'Nine Chapters' by Han Kang, the 2024 laureate, and 'Friendship' by Jon Fosse, the 2023 laureate, the research explores the extent to which AI can engage with complex literary elements such as thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, and character development. Given the Nobel Prize's prestige and its emphasis on cultural, historical, and linguistic richness, applying LLMs to these works provides a deeper understanding of both human and AI approaches to interpretation. The study uses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of coherence, creativity, and fidelity to the text, revealing the strengths and limitations of AI in tasks typically reserved for human expertise. While LLMs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities, particularly in structured tasks, they often fall short in emotional nuance and coherence, areas where human interpretation excels. This research underscores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the humanities, opening new opportunities in literary studies and beyond.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Since the inception of artificial intelligence (AI) in the 1950s, researchers have been driven by one central question: how well can AI perform in creative tasks? Whether it is generating art, composing music, or analyzing literature, the goal of understanding and replicating human creativity through machines has long been a key focus. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said, \"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\" This idea resonates powerfully in today's era of advanced AI, where breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and OpenAI's newly released ol model seem to bring us closer to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These models trained on neural networks with billions of parameters and vast corpora of natural language, offer unprecedented capabilities in text generation, comprehension, and analysis. Their impressive abilities have drawn significant attention to their potential in natural language understanding and generation. But to what extent can AI touch the boundaries of human thought? Exploring this question is also an exploration of how far we can replicate human intelligence.\nAs LLMs extend their applications far beyond traditional NLP tasks, they open new pathways in creative and intellectual domains that were once thought to be uniquely human. In particular, their potential to contribute to fields like literary analysis has sparked growing interest. While LLMs have demonstrated utility in structured tasks like machine translation and text generation, their effectiveness in more nuanced areas such as interpreting and critiquing literature remains less explored.\nThis research aims to bridge that gap by evaluating how well an advanced LLM can perform in literary analysis compared to human participants, with a focus on works by"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "As LLMs continue to evolve, their integration into different domains has sparked significant academic interest. To understand the impact of LLMs requires a comprehensive examination of recent advancements and applications. We explore some existing work that underscores the multifaceted roles of LLMs in text analysis and literary evaluation."}, {"title": "Applications of LLMs in Text Analysis", "content": "Recent research emphasizes the expanding role of LLMs in text analysis and evaluates their capabilities inn various domains such as thematic analysis, translation, creative writing, and qualitative research. Notably, studies have utilized LLMs for thematic analysis , and extending this research to languages beyond English [17]. Additionally, LLMs have also been applied for thematic analysis in more specialized fields like legal studies and poetry , as well as in specific formats such as semi-structured interviews. These works reveal that LLMs perform well in handling different textual tasks and formats in thematic analysis."}, {"title": "Cultural and Historical Contexts Analysis by LLMs", "content": "Investigations into the cultural and historical contexts within texts, particularly when analyzing with the aid of LLMs, demonstrate how well these models integrate and interpret such contexts. For instance, a benchmark for LLM-based machine translation shows that these models leverage historical and cultural information to improve translation accuracy and fidelity . Researchers have explored the linguistic and stylistic patterns of LLM-generated texts, finding that while LLMs effectively produce text consistent with historical language styles, they still need refinement to fully capture the nuanced cultural tones of various literary traditions. Evaluations also suggest"}, {"title": "Enhancing Reliability and Contextual Understanding in LLMs", "content": "Efforts have also been made to create LLMs that are culturally aligned with specific linguistic communities. For example, models adapted for Traditional Chinese as used in Taiwan [25] and French have been developed. These culturally resonant models demonstrate strong performance in understanding and generating text within their specific cultural contexts after the alignment. Meanwhile, some studies have focused on enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs by embedding contextual information instead of creating a new LLM [27]. Additionally, LLM-powered chatbots have been explored for their ability to dynamically provide responses sensitive to given culture. These chatbots are effective in accurately representing cultural nuances in heritage and cultural preservation contexts [28]. Moreover, research on LLMs has examined their capacity to adopt context-dependent value traits, proving their dynamic and controllable nature in contrast to the more stable traits observed in humans [29]."}, {"title": "Moral and Psychological Dimensions of LLMs", "content": "Regarding the moral and psychological aspects of LLMs, studies have investigated their reasoning about moral and legal issues [32]. From a social psychology perspective, research on LLM agents reveals that these models can simulate and adapt collaborative behaviors based on contextual cues [33]. Additionally, efforts have been made to train psychologically specific models. For example, PsycoLLM was trained on a high-quality psychological dataset and has proven effective on psychology benchmarks [34]. LLM-powered agents also show significant potential in enhancing mental health support and serving as therapeutic tools , demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively applied to psychological analysis."}, {"title": "LLMs in Literary Evaluation", "content": "While previous studies have demonstrated various applications of LLMs, our work is pioneering in using LLMs as evaluators for analyzing Nobel Prize-winning literature. By leveraging the language understanding capabilities of LLMs and incorporating insights from engaged human evaluators, our study systematically assesses Nobel Prize-winning works across multiple dimensions. These dimensions include thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, character development, moral and philosophical insights, narrative techniques, and emotional tone. Specifically, our novel approach not only quantifies literary merit but also evaluates how well LLM analyses align with human perspectives on literary aspects. By analyzing the gap between analysis from LLM and human interpretation, our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of literary merit in distinguished works of literature."}, {"title": "3 Experiments and Observation", "content": "The central objective of this research is to evaluate the comparative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and human participants in the execution of literary analysis, particularly focusing on works by Nobel Prize-winning authors. This investigation seeks to determine whether an advanced LLM, such as OpenAI's ol model, can rival or surpass graduate-level students in interpreting and critiquing complex literary texts. Through the analysis of two short stories, \"Nine Chapters\" by Han Kang [38] and \"Friendship\" by Jon Fosse , this study endeavors to explore the extent to which AI models can engage with various dimensions of literary analysis, such as thematic interpretation, character development, and intertextuality, among others. Given the increasing application of AI in creative and intellectual fields, the significance of this research lies in its potential to illuminate the strengths and limitations of LLMs in tasks traditionally entrusted to human expertise. While ol model has exhibited competence in structured data analysis and text generation, its efficacy in nuanced, subjective domains like literature remains insufficiently explored. This study thus contributes to the understanding of ol model's role in the interpretation of humanistic content, offering insights that could influence the future integration of AI in literary studies and related disciplines. Additionally, by directly comparing the ol model's output with that of expert human participants, this research establishes a structured framework for assessing how AI can complement or challenge conventional modes of literary critique, ultimately broadening the discourse on human-AI collaboration in the humanities."}, {"title": "3.1 Experimental Design", "content": "The design of this experiment follows a comparative framework, involving both human participants, who also contributed as coauthors of this paper, and the ol model. They were given the task of analyzing two short stories that have won Nobel Prizes: \"Nine Chapters\" by Han Kang and \"Friendship\" by Jon Fosse. Participants, whether human or AI, conducted their analyses focusing on several literary factors: thematic exploration, intertextual connections, historical and cultural contexts, innovations in language and structure, character portrayal, moral and philosophical interpretations, narrative strategies, and the emotional and psychological depth. Here are the specific instructions of aspects to analyze:\n\u2022 Thematic Analysis: Identify the central themes of the work and discuss their significance in relation to the narrative's broader context.\n\u2022 Intertextuality and Literary Influence: Detect and comment on any references or influences from other literary traditions or works that shape the narrative's meaning.\n\u2022 Cultural and Historical Contexts: Analyze how the story reflects or critiques the cultural and historical period in which it was written, offering insights into its societal implications.\n\u2022 Linguistic and Structural Innovations: Highlight any innovative uses of language or narrative structures, such as non-linear storytelling or stylistic techniques like stream of consciousness."}, {"title": "3.2 Evaluation on Analysis of \"Friendship\"", "content": "This section offers a thorough assessment of both the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of the literary analyses conducted by human participants and the o1 model.

Their responses were frequently augmented with transitional phrases and logical connectors, facilitating a smooth progression of ideas. Conversely, the ol model demonstrated certain\ndeficiencies in coherence, particularly in discourse related to linguistic and structural innovations. The AI's outputs were insufficiently equipped with logical transitions,\nwhich at times resulted in fragmented or disjointed responses.\nCreativity\nThe ol model outperformed human participants in certain creative aspects, particularly in its analysis of cultural background and intertextuality. It provided deeper\nand more detailed insights, such as drawing connections to existentialism and themes\nof alienation and the human condition. These responses revealed a broader and more\nnuanced understanding of the text. In contrast, while human participants produced\nmore vivid and emotionally resonant analyses, their creative insights were not as\nexpansive as those offered by the model in terms of connecting the text to broader\nliterary traditions.\nFidelity to the Text\nIn terms of fidelity, the ol model excelled in producing highly accurate summaries of\nthe text. It demonstrated a strong ability to remain closely aligned with the original\ncontent, particularly in character development and thematic analysis. For example,\nthe model provided a thorough and precise summary of the main characters' traits,\navoiding personal bias. Human participants, however, tended to introduce subjective\ninterpretations, which sometimes deviated from the strict fidelity to the text. This sub-\njective element was particularly noticeable in analyses concerning emotional tone and\npsychological depth, where human responses were influenced by personal perspectives.\nThematic Analysis\nBoth the ol model and human participants identified similar overarching themes, such\nas friendship, humanity, family, and society. However, the ol model's thematic analysis\nwas less refined in its language, lacking the aesthetic sophistication typically found in\nhuman-written responses. While the model presented a comprehensive view, human\nparticipants offered more nuanced, expressive interpretations of these themes.\nIntertextuality and Literary Influence\nThe ol model provided deeper insights into intertextuality and literary influence, iden-\ntifying significant literary connections, albeit with somewhat rigid expression. Human\nparticipants, by contrast, often drew from minimalist literary traditions, offering\ncreative yet less technically accurate connections.\nCultural and Historical Contexts\nBoth groups performed well in analyzing the cultural and historical context of the\nwork, recognizing the relationship between the post-industrial society depicted and\nthe individual. The ol model was more precise in situating the story within its tempo-\nral and spatial context, while human participants offered broader, more interpretive\ninsights."}, {"title": "Linguistic and Structural Innovations", "content": "The ol model and human participants both highlighted the text's minimalist language\nand use of third-person perspective.

Their analyses\nprovided a well-rounded understanding of the characters' traits and development."}, {"title": "Moral and Philosophical Insights", "content": "While both groups recognized social responsibility as a key theme, human participants\noffered a more comprehensive analysis by discussing the duality of violence and peace\nwithin the story. The ol model, on the other hand, provided a more concise conclusion\nwithout delving into the reasoning behind its interpretation."}, {"title": "Narrative Techniques and Temporal Structure", "content": "Both the ol model and human participants noted the linear narrative structure of the\nstory. However, the model provided more explicit examples to support its conclusions,\noffering a clearer explanation of the author's intent."}, {"title": "Emotional Tone and Psychological Depth", "content": "The ol model approached the emotional tone and psychological depth of the text by\nfirst summarizing key elements and then building upon them progressively. Human\nparticipants, on the other hand, used descriptive language and focused more on\ndetailed environmental and character portrayals to convey their analyses.\nOverall, the qualitative evaluation revealed that while the ol model provided\nbroader, more comprehensive analyses, it lacked the aesthetic and emotional nuance\nfound in human interpretations. The model was objective and detailed, but human par-\nticipants enriched their analyses with subjective insights, offering a more emotionally\nengaging experience."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Quantitative Evaluation", "content": "In addition to the qualitative assessment, the analysis was supplemented with quan-\ntitative evaluations across three key dimensions: coherence, creativity, and fidelity to\nthe text.

While\nthis study adds to the growing literature on AI in the humanities, demonstrating\nboth the current strengths of LLMs and the areas where human expertise remains\nindispensable, there are still several key aresa for improvemwnt:\nFirst, enhancing the coherence and emotional interpretive abilities of LLMs is\nessential. Future models could be designed to incorporate elements of human emotional\nreasoning, which would help in bridging the gap between mechanical text analysis and\nhumanistic literary critique. Second, extending this study to larger datasets and more\ndiverse literary genres could provide a broader understanding of LLMs' capabilities\nand limitations in different contexts. Finally, technical solutions such as robust factu-\nality evaluations, toxicity filters, and bias detectors will be vital to ensureing LLMS'\nreliability and trustworthiness. These will help ensure the uphold cultural values,\npluralism, and dignity.\nOverall, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in the\nhumanities, demonstrating both the current strengths of LLMs and the areas where\nhuman expertise remains indispensable. As AI continues to evolve, the collaboration\nbetween human and machine in creative fields will likely lead to more sophisticated\nand insightful analyses, furthering our understanding of both literature and AI's role\nin intellectual discourse."}]}

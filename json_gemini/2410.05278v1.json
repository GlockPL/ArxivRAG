ADCs combine the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic small molecule drugs, creating a sophisticated therapeutic modality that aims to deliver highly potent drugs directly to cancer cells while minimizing systemic toxicity [Peters and Senter, 2018]. This unique approach leverages the precise targeting capabilities of antibodies to selectively bind to tumor-associated antigens, followed by internalization and subsequent release of the cytotoxic payload within the cancer cells [Lambert, 2017].\nThe efficacy of ADCs is fundamentally dependent on three key components: the antibody, the linker, and the payload [Beck et al., 2017]. While each component plays a crucial role, the payload - typically a small molecule drug with potent cytotoxic activity - is particularly critical in determining the overall therapeutic efficacy of the ADC [Zhao et al., 2020]. The ideal ADC payload should possess high potency, suitable physicochemical properties for conjugation and release, and a mechanism of action effective against the target cancer cells [Beck et al., 2017, Tsuchikama and An, 2018]. Consequently, the design, selection, and optimization of ADC payloads have become central challenges in ADC development, directly impacting the success rate of these promising therapeutics [Carter and Senter, 2018].\nThe importance of accurately predicting ADC payload activity cannot be overstated in the context of ADC development. Traditional approaches to payload selection and optimization have relied heavily on empirical methods, including high-throughput screening and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies [Beck et al., 2017]. While these methods have led to the development of several successful ADCs, they are often time-consuming, resource-intensive, and limited in their ability to explore vast chemical spaces efficiently [Zhao et al., 2020]. Moreover, the complex interplay between payload structure, linker chemistry, and antibody characteristics in determining ADC efficacy poses significant challenges to traditional predictive methods [Carter and Senter, 2018].\nThese limitations have spurred a growing interest in more advanced, computational approaches to ADC payload activity prediction. In particular, there is an urgent need for methods that can:\n1. Rapidly screen large libraries of potential payload molecules [Beck et al., 2017]\n2. Accurately predict payload activity based on molecular structure [Zhao et al., 2020]\n3. Account for the unique biological context of ADCs, including target interaction [Carter and Senter, 2018]\n4.

To develop a well-performing classification model, a cutoff value of 100 \u00b5M was established, with inhibitory IC50 values below this threshold labeled as positive and those above labeled as negative.\nThe collected molecules possessing inhibitory effects against DNA Topoisomerase I, along with their topological information in the form of SMILES strings, were prepared for 3D conformation analysis. Initial conformer generation was performed using OpenBabel [Yoshikawa N, 2019] and optimized under the MMFF94 force field via RDKit [Tosco et al., 2014]. Conformer redundancy was eliminated using an RMSD cutoff 1.5 \u00c5.\nTo determine the coordinate space of the potential Topoisomerase I inhibitors, NLDock [Feng et al., 2021] was employed to generate binding conformations in the ligand binding site of crystallized Topoisomerase I, in complex with DNA fragments and Camptothecin (PDB database ID: 1t8i [Staker et al., 2005]).

Unlike traditional methods that only extract atom type information, our algorithm also incorporates chemical environment information to more comprehensively characterise the molecular structure [Gilmer et al., 2017].\nSpecifically, for a given molecule (mol), we extract the following atomic features:\nAtomic number: indicates the type of element\nDegree: the number of bonds attached to the atom\nNumber of hydrogen atoms: number of hydrogen atoms attached to the atom\nImplicit valence: the atomic valence level at which all chemical bonds are considered\nAromaticity judgement: whether the atom belongs to an aromatic ring or not\nAtomic coordinates: the position of the atom in three-dimensional space\nThese features reflect the chemical properties of atoms from different perspectives and help the graph neural network to understand the molecular structure more accurately [Wu et al., 2020b]. In particular, the introduction of atomic coordinate information enables the model to capture the spatial conformation of the molecule, which is crucial for the conformational relationship of ADC payload [Xiong et al., 2019].\nWhile extracting the atomic node features, we also construct the edge index information, i.e., the existence of an undirected edge between each pair of connected atoms [Zhou et al., 2020].

The attention mechanism serves to discern these critical substructures and atomic associations that exert the most substantial influence on the activity of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) payloads.\nThe sequential deployment of three GAT layers permits the model to progressively discern higher-order and extended molecular interactions. Such complexity is fundamental for ADC payloads, given that molecular conformation and the topological distribution of functional moieties can markedly affect binding affinity and cellular internalization. Furthermore, this hierarchical attention architecture enables the dissection of interactions across disparate scales, mirroring the multifaceted nature of molecular interactions within biological frameworks.\nImportantly, the attention mechanism not only bolsters predictive accuracy but also enhances the biological interpretability of the model. By scrutinizing the attention coefficients, insights can be gleaned into the atomic interactions and molecular fragments that the model prioritizes for activity prognostication.

DumplingGNN's superior performance on this dataset showcases its exceptional ability to learn and generalize across varied molecular property prediction tasks, even without 3D structural information.\nWhile DumplingGNN does not achieve the highest scores on all datasets, it consistently performs competitively. For instance, on the BACE dataset"}]}

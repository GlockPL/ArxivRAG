Introduction", "content": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the ability to comprehensively analyze and understand complex data is paramount. However, the ever-increasing complexity of real data requires sophisticated AI pipelines that seamlessly integrate different stages such as data collection, preparation, model generation, and evaluation. Such a pipeline can be illustrated as a chain of distinct yet interdependent stages, each contributing to the overarching goal of turning data into actionable intelligence. Like a well-coordinated symphony, these stages require harmonious collaboration to achieve optimal results. The concept of AI pipelines therefore represents more than just a linear progression; it signifies the orchestration of diverse processes to accomplish a larger purpose. At the core of this revolution lie AI pipelines, intricate networks of interconnected data processing and analysis steps designed to transform raw data into meaningful insights or outcomes using AI techniques. The evolution of simple AI models to adaptive, systematic AI pipelines has ushered in a new era of data-driven decision-making by solving complex tasks in an ever-changing environment. Making AI understandable, accessible and usable by everyone in every domain requires a domain-independent, easy-to-use pipeline architecture that can be integrated into a complex ecosystem of experts and non-experts. However, the design and implementation of such pipelines often prove challenging due to the intricate interplay of technical components and the diverse requirements of different application domains."}, {"title": "2. State of the Art", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines play a critical role in the modern landscape of AI systems by facilitating their efficient development, deployment, and maintenance. These pipelines orchestrate a series of sequential steps that transform raw data into valuable output [6]. This output ranges from refined datasets and trained AI models to complete predictive systems and includes stages such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, data prediction, and deployment to cloud or edge infrastructure [34]. A key benefit of AI pipelines is their ability to automate repetitive and time-intensive tasks inherent in AI development, including data refinement, feature engineering, and model selection [31]. By mechanizing these processes, AI pipelines significantly reduce the time and cognitive demands and simplify the use of AI to solve real-world problems [31]. According to Hummer et al., this time-saving advantage can be further extended by using parallel computations, which can save up to 7/\nBuilding AI pipelines can involve various levels of sophistication, from single, highly specialized pipelines designed for specific use cases to multi-functional, cloud-based AI pipelines. In recent years, the field of open source ML pipelines has seen significant growth, with tools such as FluxCD [40] specializing in continuous delivery for seamless updates of containerized applications in Kubernetes clusters. Various tools and frameworks such as DVC (Data Version Control) [7], Git Large File Storage [33], Apache Hadoop [35], Apache Airflow [36], Apache Spark [39], Apache Flink [37], Apache NiFi [38], Prefect [29] and Luigi [43] together provide a versatile toolkit that covers a wide range of use cases and takes into account different preferences and requirements.\nAdditionally, the field has seen significant growth in generic open-source ML Pipelines, exempli-fied by MLFlow [23], a versatile platform for end-to-end machine learning and lifecycle management; DataRobot [9], an automated machine learning platform streamlining model development; H2O.ai [18], an open-source framework emphasizing user-friendly model building and scalability; andAutoAI [31], an advanced autonomous AI design based on cutting-edge algorithms.\nSpecialized pipelines have emerged from recent research, such as KoopaML [16] and IPMP [15] in the medicine and health care sector, as well as proposals from companies like Uber's Michelangelo, addressing the complete lifecycle of AI models, and Facebook's FBLearner, focusing on internal ML initiatives.\nCloud-based pipelines, driven by global players like Google Cloud Vertex AI Pipelines [17], Ama-zon SageMaker [4], Microsoft Azure Machine Learning [22], IBM Watson Studio [20], Databricks [8], Kubeflow [41] and Google's TFX [6], offer comprehensive platforms for establishing, deploying, and overseeing end-to-end machine learning workflows. However, the high cost and complexity of these pipelines present barriers to entry for many users.\nIn contrast, AI4EU [2, 3, 13, 14, 45], a European initiative, was developed to transfer knowledge from research to business applications. It promotes a \u201cEuropean on-demand platform and ecosystem for artificial intelligence\" [13] that \"brings the AI community together\" [13]. In this context, it can be used by experts developing AI components and making them available to the community, as well as by laypeople without AI knowledge.\nDespite these advances, none of the pipelines developed has provided a universal solution applicable in all contexts. In addition, no AI pipeline is known to date that addresses AI experts, domain experts and laypeople equally by integrating LLM techniques and offers comprehensive support over"}, {"title": "3. ALPACA Requirements Specification", "content": "To achieve the goals mentioned above, ALPACA must fulfill several important functions. One focus is on the user interface, which must be as easy to use as possible. This also means that all visualizations of the pipeline stages, namely data acquisition, data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and data prediction, must be easily accessible, understandable, and configurable.\nAnother key feature regarding the user interface is handling different user levels. The system must acknowledge different user levels, catering to novice users exploring AI and advanced developers extending the system's capabilities. This user-centric design enhances usability and accessibility.\nTo ensure future viability, another key feature is the maintainability and expandability of the entire system. It must be ensured that developers can effortlessly integrate new functions into the system without adapting existing parts. The GUI and the underlying architectural principle must be based on mechanisms and strategies that enable quick and easy integration of new functions. For example, the user interface must offer mechanics with which new functions can be seamlessly integrated without having to change the GUI. Reflections, a mechanism allowing dynamic examination and modification of program structure at runtime, can be used so that users can easily benefit from new pre-processing steps and AI algorithms. For this purpose, the system must offer base classes and interfaces that are based on reflections, which are optimized for automatic GUI generation. This mechanism eliminates the need for manual GUI development and simplifies the customization of preprocessing pipelines. Additionally, the provided base classes request developers to provide a useful description of each feature and each parameter implemented. This can assist inexperienced users in using the functions provided.\nThe ALPACA system's scalability plays a crucial role in achieving its adaptability, usability, and robustness because it enables the system to adapt to evolving requirements and accommodate larger datasets. This should be ensured by deploying the system on a Kubernetes server, which also enables the efficient allocation of resources and thus meets growing computing requirements. For example, all pods can be orchestrated by Kubernetes, allowing it to scale horizontally by deploying multiple containers across clusters. This elasticity ensures optimal resource utilization and performance even as demands fluctuate.\nBut all of these features are useless if the results are not reproducible and trustworthy. To ensure this, the system must capture and store all artefacts necessary for reproducibility. On the one hand, this includes all user interactions, but on the other hand, it also includes all generated data. While the user interactions can be saved in XML data, the artefacts must be stored in a compressed manner that is as memory-saving as possible. Furthermore, it must be ensured that the log data is passed on across all pipeline stages and enriched with the user interactions of each pipeline stage. This, on the one hand, facilitates the seamless scaling of the prediction component; on the other hand, it enables reproducibility across all stages. The resulting close documentation of all data also enables data to be replicated and validated. Guaranteeing the essential cornerstones of scientific work strengthens trust in the system's analyses and findings.\nIn the following sections, we begin a detailed examination of our proposed AI pipeline, ALPACA, and highlight its transformative potential."}, {"title": "4. The ALPACA System", "content": "The system is designed as a versatile and modular platform to address the complexity of AI analysis and increase accessibility to this new disruptive technology. To take into account the complexity of data analysis pipelines and enable seamless integration of the data collection, pre-processing, and AI model training phases, much emphasis was placed on a modular, cloud-based system architecture. This enables comprehensibility and access to AI for different user groups. Great importance was placed on ease of use and expandability. To shed light on these facts, we delve deep into the system architecture and examine individual pipeline stages, technical components and complex functionality. At its core, ALPACA is based on the principle of adaptability. To comprehend the system's architecture, we initiate our exploration from a user's perspective. The complete workflow is governable and configurable through a web UI. Initiated by users, tasks are orchestrated by Celery and executed through interacting Kubernetes pods, thereby ensuring the automated processing of individual AI analysis steps. The data flow, initiated by user input and traversing through processing workers to data storage in the database, is depicted in Figure 1. Additionally, the specific pod architecture for our use case is presented in Figure 2. The modular structure allows developers to quickly and easily expand the system and adapt it to new scenarios. This means that ALPACA can also be used as the basis for an AI ecosystem, similar to the AI4EU project [45, 13, 14]. Our research shows how easy-to-use AI pipelines can help facilitate and democratize access to AI capabilities. This transformative approach could reshape the landscape of AI analytics pipelines and stimulate a new wave of research, development, and use in artificial intelligence.\nThe ALPACA system is designed to integrate both existing and new components into the system seamlessly. The focus is on modularity and expandability, as well as the user-friendly operation of the system. The system's architectural design embodies these principles, fostering a cohesive amalgamation of its diverse components.\nThe pipeline consists of the three basic phases of data acquisition, data preparation, and model training. The first stage involves the implementation of the data collection pipeline, a critical stage that exhibits a pronounced correlation with the underlying problem to be addressed. The specific use case under consideration in this research pertains to the identification of functionally similar Android applications. Within this context, the primary objective of the first stage of the pipeline is to acquire data from APK repositories, employing sophisticated web scraping techniques. Furthermore, this phase of the pipeline is tasked with the extraction of pertinent features from this fundamental APK data. To achieve this feature extraction, the AndroGuard tool [11] is employed as a means of facilitating the extraction of these discriminative features. The second stage is dedicated to data preprocessing, which has the ability to move away from the specific use case and enable a generic perspective. In it, the collected features will be subjected to careful refinement to convert them into a format suitable for training AI models. This stage includes selecting, merging, and transforming the data. The third stage assumes responsibility for the artificial intelligence (AI) model and, similar to the antecedent second stage, can be regarded with relative independence from the specific scenario under consideration.\nThis chapter continues to provide a comprehensive overview of ALPACA's front-end and back-end architecture and highlights the seamless integration of various technologies. It becomes clear that ALPACA is more than just an analysis tool; it is evidence of the advances in adaptive AI pipelines."}, {"title": "4.1. Technical Fundament", "content": "Python3 [30] and its rich library ecosystem constitute the foundational framework for ALPACA. It was chosen for its widespread adoption in the AI community, which facilitates seamless integration with popular ML libraries. As a container orchestration platform, Kubernetes [42] was selected for its industry-wide adoption and proven efficiency in dynamically provisioning and managing system resources for scalable AI workflows."}, {"title": "4.2. Backend Technologies", "content": "The foundation of any AI pipeline is data management and storage. At the software level, Pandas [21] data frames are used, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of data processing. MongoDB [24] serves as the system's database, providing robust and flexible storage for collected app data, preprocessed datasets, trained models, and user interactions. Task coordination for container-based workers is handled by Celery [5], a distributed task queue for efficient task management that ensures streamlined and seamless handling of data collection, preprocessing, and model training. Redis [32] was chosen as the Celery backend due to its ability to work in RAM, which significantly increases the performance of the system. This orchestration not only facilitates smooth operations but also contributes to scalability, reproducibility of results, and ease of use.\nTo practically demonstrate ALPACA's capabilities, an app similarity detection system was im-plemented. A Selemium-based [44] crawler is used in conjunction with the Firefox Geckodriver in headless mode [26] to collect app information. The collected APKs are taken over by Androguard, which then takes over the extraction of essential app attributes and functions for analysis. This demo scenario demonstrates ALPACA's adaptability to real-world AI use cases.\nOn the AI side, all neural networks are implemented using Keras TensorFlow [1]. In addition, Scikit-Learn [27] is used to implement the classic non-neural models. This versatility allows re-searchers to explore a wide range of AI techniques within the platform.\nTogether, these frameworks form a cohesive ecosystem that gives developers and users the ability to perform comprehensive AI analysis."}, {"title": "4.3.

Pipeline Stages of ALPACA", "content": "The architecture of the ALPACA system is based on a modular design consisting of three primary pipeline stages: data acquisition, data preprocessing, and AI modelling. These pipelines interact synergistically to process data and generate actionable insights. The basis for this is the effective data management and the intuitively designed user interface, which increases user-friendliness and transparency and thus secures the core tasks of the ALPACA system. Below, we explain the basics of each pipeline stage. A detailed description of the underlying mechanisms and strategies of the pipeline stages, particularly about data management, usability, reproducibility, and transparency, follows in the chapters 5, 6, and 7.\n\u2022 Stage 1: Data Collection Pipeline: The data collection pipeline is the system's initial stage, responsible for sourcing and gathering data from app stores. In our demo scenario, we extract app data from APK repositories using web scraping techniques and leverage AndroGuard for comprehensive app feature extraction.\n\u2022 Stage 2: Data Preprocessing Pipeline: The data preprocessing pipeline refines the collected data, preparing it for AI model training. For this purpose, the collected data undergoes preprocessing to shape it into suitable formats for AI model training. Data selection, merging, and transformation steps streamline data for subsequent analysis.\n\u2022 Stage 3: AI Model Pipeline: This stage encompasses AI model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The Data Collection Pipeline (Stage 1)", "content": "The data collection pipeline represents the foundational stage of the ALPACA system and is responsible for acquiring the basic analysis data. As elucidated earlier, the data collection depends largely on the underlying use case. In the demo scenario of detecting similar Android applications, the data subject to analysis is derived from Android packages (APKs). Given the potential divergence in requirements across various use cases, the configuration of this pipeline stage necessitates adaptation contingent upon the specific demands of the given use case and can be easily exchanged and expanded at ALPACA. The following section delves into the intricacies of the data collection pipeline in the context of Android feature extraction, elucidating the roles of the crawler, analyzer, and extractor in gathering metadata, APIs, and other attributes from APKs."}, {"title": "5.1. Crawler", "content": "The crawler component forms the initial step in the data collection pipeline and is the gateway to accessing information from external sources. This step fundamentally hinges on the particulars of the individual use case and mandates adaptation on a case-by-case basis. It is encapsulated within a Docker container, providing advantages (Figure 1). Firstly, it facilitates swift and facile interchangeability, allowing for seamless adjustments to suit the specific requirements of the given use case. Secondly, the stage is equipped with the capability to initiate multiple crawlers as celery workers. Specifically, our crawler's role involves extracting data from two primary sources: APK Pure and the Play Store. Crawled data will be stored in MongoDB. In this demo scenario, APK Pure serves as a repository for collecting APK files, while the Play Store is used to gather some metadata related to the APK. This construction was chosen because of the access limitations of the Play Store. The crawler leverages Selenium and a headless Firefox driver to automate the web crawling process, enabling seamless extraction of APK files and metadata. The metadata acquired from the Play Store includes categories, app descriptions, size, required Android version, developer information, and app ratings. These attributes provide some simple features to the app similarity analysis that are essential for our use case. However, the primary data source is the Android APK extracted by APK Pure. This design ensures that ALPACA's data collection pipeline can be adapted to a variety of scenarios, enabling comprehensive analysis and experimentation in different application scenarios."}, {"title": "5.2. Analyzer", "content": "After gathering the APK files, the analyzer component, which harnesses the capabilities of AndroGuard, comes into play. This component is also encapsulated in a Docker container, which allows us to scale those workers. The analyzer processes the collected APKs and generates AndroGuard sessions that encapsulate the essential information from the APKs. The analyzer component only generates the Androguard sessions and does not extract any features. These sessions are stored in the MongoDB database, which allows us to handle those sessions by multiple workers at the same time without regenerating every time. The sessions form the basis for further analysis, enabling a granular understanding of the apps under examination.\u00b9"}, {"title": "5.3. Extractor", "content": "Working in tandem with the analyzer, the extractor component leverages AndroGuard to extract a multitude of critical features from the APKs. The extractor is also dockerized and implemented as a celery worker. In addition, the extractor can specifically extract features that are not yet in the database. This allows us to have an APK processed by multiple workers. In addition, aborted extraction processes can be resumed without having to re-extract all features that have already been extracted. For feature extraction, the extractor uses the sessions generated by the analyzer. It can extract the following features:\n\u2022 APIs: The extracted APIs include Android APIs, third-party APIs, and internal function names, offering insights into the app's functionality and potential interactions.\n\u2022 Manifest: The AndroidManifest.xml is parsed to extract essential information related to the app's configuration and components.\n\u2022 Strings: The strings within the APK and manifest are extracted, providing textual insights into the app's purpose and functionality.\n\u2022 Intents: The various intents, including services, receivers, and activities, are identified to understand the app's functionalities and communication mechanisms.\n\u2022 Permissions: Permissions requested by the App reveal the level of access the app requests from the Android system, shedding light on potential privacy and security implications.\n\u2022 Features: The features utilized by the app are identified, offering insights into its capabilities and interactions."}, {"title": "6.

The introduction of AI into critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and the legal sector will only be made possible by a systems which supports explainable A.\nIncorporating concepts such as Federated Learning and Continuous Learning would further expand ALPACA's capabilities. Federated Learning, a decentralized approach to model training, allows devices or nodes to learn together while keeping the data localized, which would address privacy and security concerns. Continuous learning, on the other hand, would enable the models to adapt to changing circumstances. The future integration of these concepts into ALPACA will ensure a dynamic and adaptive AI system.\nContinuing to improve user interfaces and continually embedding robust ethical frameworks based on new policies and laws are critical to ensure ALPACAs' usabillity and legality. These efforts will continue to make sure user privacy and ethical data use, creating a user-friendly and trustworthy environment in the long term.\nAs the Android ecosystem evolves, the effectiveness of ALPACA in terms of the demo scenario depends on the Androguard framework used for app analysis. Such an outdated tools landscape is subject to certain restrictions due to technical progress. In the case of AndroGuard, the last stable version was released on February 18, 2019 [10], in the age of Android Oreo (version 9, API level 28). However, for good results, the basic data of the model training must be current, precise, and correct. It is therefore crucial that the tools used for data collection are adapted to technical changes and advances. Androguard should either be updated or replaced for future projects.\nIn summary, these improvements would make ALPACA a more transparent, adaptable, and user-friendly AI analysis tool. Consideration and integration of these areas would ensure the relevance and impact of ALPACA in various user scenarios and critical applications in the future."}]}

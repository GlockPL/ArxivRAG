We propose two approaches to accomplish this, analyze them theoretically, and demonstrate their effectiveness through a series of experiments.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Consider the problem of selecting a fixed number of k nodes from a network. Our goal is twofold: to identify the most influential nodes, and to ensure that the selection proportionally represents the diversity within the network. For instance, consider a network composed of three groups of densely connected nodes. Assume the groups contain 50%, 30%, and 20% of all nodes, respectively, and connections between groups are relatively sparse. If the objective is to select k = 10 nodes, a proportional approach would involve selecting five most influential nodes from the first group, three from the second, and two from the third group. In this paper we design selection methods that capture this intuition, yet apply to networks with more complex structures.\nOur model has broad applicability across various real-world scenarios. For instance, imagine a network where nodes represent political blogs or news websites, and the links indicate references between them. In this context, proportional selection would ensure a balanced representation of predominant opinions, such as left-wing and right-wing political views, within the chosen set of websites. As another example consider the case of a strike group described by Michael [1997]: After acquiring a forest products facility, new management revised workers' compensation, prompting a strike. When negotiations stalled, external consultants analyzed the workers' communication network, revealing three distinct groups: young Spanish speakers, young English speakers, and older English speakers. Consultants identified Bob and Norm as key communicators and, by engaging them, quickly resolved the strike. Interestingly, for k = 2, our methods identify the same individuals. When k = 3, our best-performing method also selects Alejandro, ensuring representation from each of the predominant groups.\nFinally, our model generalizes elections. As discussed in Section 4, for bipartite graphs, it reduces to a well-studied election framework where proportionality is extensively explored [Lackner and Skowron, 2023, Faliszewski et al., 2017]. From what follows our work contributes to the social choice literature by enabling elections where the set of candidates is not predetermined. Instead, citizens can cast their votes for individuals they know personally. This concept has been previously explored in the context of vote delegation, or liquid democracy [Green-Armytage, 2015, Brill, 2018]. However, liquid democracy often faces criticism because delegated votes tend to concentrate in the hands of a single influential individual. In contrast, our approach focuses on selecting a group of representatives based on votes cast through personal connections and trust. Thus, our approach combines the benefits of indirect democracy with a more personalized voting process, fostering a stronger connection between voters and their representatives.\nNumerous measures of node importance has been proposed, and they are commonly known as centralities. In this paper, we propose two approaches that define selection rules for representative nodes based on given centrality measures. While our approaches are general and compatible with most prominent centrality measures as well as machine learning models, we focus here on two particular examples: PageRank [Page et al., 1999] and Katz centrality [Katz, 1953]."}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "We consider unweighted simple directed graphs. We will interpret nodes as voters and outgoing edges as their support for other nodes, or simply their votes. A graph (or a network) is a pair, G = (V, E), where V is a set of n nodes and EC V \u00d7 V is a set of m edges; the edges are ordered pairs of nodes. An edge (u, v) is an outgoing edge for node u and an incoming edge for v. The set of outgoing edges of u is denoted by E+(u). For a set of nodes S\u2286 V, we let E+(S) = Uues E+(u). The number of outgoing (resp. incoming) edges of u is called out-degree (resp. in-degree) of u and denoted by deg\u207a(u) (resp. deg (u)).\nA walk is a sequence of nodes (v1,..., vk) such that every two consecutive nodes are connected by an edge: (Vi, Vi+1) \u2208 E for every i \u2208 1,..., k \u2212 1. The length of such a walk is equal to k \u2212 1, i.e., the number of edges in the walk. Note that a single node is a walk of length 0. If in a walk all nodes are distinct, we call it a path. A node u is called a predecessor of w if there exists a walk (v1, ..., vk) such that u = v\u2081 and w = vk. A node u is a successor of w if w is a predecessor of u. The set of predecessors of node u is denoted by Pred(u) and its set of successors is denoted by Succ(u). For a set of nodes S\u2286 V we define Succ(S) = Uues Succ(u). The set of all walks in G is denoted by \u03a9(G).\nFor a set of nodes S \u2286 V, we denote by G[S] the graph (S, {(u, v) \u2208 E : u, v \u2208 S}), i.e., the graph containing S and the edges between nodes from S. For a set of edges M \u2286 E, we denote by G \u2013 M the graph (V, E \\ M), i.e., the subgraph of G that remains after the deletion of edges in M. A (weakly connected) component of G is a (maximal) subset of nodes S V such that every two nodes are connected by a walk in the underlying (undirected) graph inferred by G. A (sub)graph G is strongly connected if for every two nodes u, v of G there exists a walk from u to v. In particular, a strongly connected component is a component which is strongly connected. A clique is a graph in which every two nodes u, v are connected by an edge.\nA graph G = (V, E) is called (directed) bipartite if all walks in Q(G) are of length of at most 1, in other words, if its set of nodes V can be divided into two disjoint sets V = V\u2081 \u222a V2 such that every edge in E is an outgoing for a node in V\u2081 and an incoming for a node in V2. A graph G = (V, E) is called functional if deg+(u) \u2264 1, for all nodes u \u2208 V. The nomenclature arises from the observation that the set of edges can be interpreted as a function that assigns to each node (at most) one other.\nGiven a network G(V, E) and an integer k < n our goal is to select k nodes from V. A method that performs this selection is referred to as a group selection rule for networks, in short, a rule, and denoted by R. We will also refer to the outcome of such a rule simply as R(G, k). In our pursuit to find a rule that elects most influential nodes in a proportional manner, we will use the measures of nodes' importance from network science as well as the concepts from social choice theory."}, {"title": "Centrality Measures", "content": "A centrality measure F is a function that for each graph G = (V, E) and node v \u2208 V assigns a real value, denoted by FG(v). The higher the value, the more central the node is considered. Our methods can be combined with any centrality measure; yet, we will focus on centrality measures based on walks: PageRank and Katz centrality."}, {"title": "PageRank", "content": "For a given decay factor \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), PageRank of a node v in graph G is defined as:\n$$PR(v) = \\sum_{(u_1,...,u_k,v)\\in\\Omega(G)} \\frac{\\alpha^k}{\\prod_{i=1}^k deg^+(u_i)}$$\nAt a high level, PageRank of v is proportional to the expected number of times that v is visited by a random walk that starts from a random node and in each step follows an outgoing edge chosen uniformly at random or ends the walk with probability 1 a. Hence, PageRank of a node mostly depends on the number and the importance of its predecessors. We note that many variants of PageRank appear in the literature (see, e.g., the work of W\u0105s and Skibski [2023])."}, {"title": "Katz centrality", "content": "For a given decay factor \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/\u03bb), where \u03bb is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of G, Katz centrality of a node v in G is defined as:\n$$K_G^{\\alpha}(v) = \\sum_{(u_1,...,u_k,v)\\in\\Omega(G)} \\alpha^k$$\nKatz centrality can be considered a parallel version of PageRank, where the importance of a node is not split between its outgoing edges, but transferred through all its outgoing edges simultanously.\nFor notational simplicity, when it is clear from the context, we omit G and \u03b1 from the scripts."}, {"title": "Election Rules", "content": "An (committee) election profile is a triple (V, C, \u00b5), where \u00b5 is a function that denotes the preferences expressed by the voters of V over the candidates of C. A voting rule is a function that for each profile (V, C, \u00b5) and natural k, elects a committee consisting of k candidates of C according to the preferences of V as expressed by \u00b5. Preferences can be expressed in various ways, e.g., using approval ballots where \u00b5\u2081(c) = 1 if voter i approves candidate c and \u00b5\u2081(c) = 0, otherwise, or using general utility functions in which \u00b5\u2081(c) is an arbitrary non-negative value indicating the satisfaction of i from electing c. We particularly focus on scenarios where V = C, i.e., voters aim to select a committee from among themselves by expressing preferences over one another.\nTwo of the simplest election rules are Approval Voting (AV) and Satisfaction Approval Voting (SAV). Under these rules, each candidate c is getting a score from each voter vi, which equals \u00b5\u00a1(c) for AV and \u00b5\u2081(c)/ \u2211c'\u2208c Mi(c') for SAV. In both rules, the k candidates having the maximum total score form the winning committee. An alternative voting rule that aims to select sets of candidates in a proportional way has been recently proposed under the name Method of Equal Shares [Peters and Skowron, 2020].\nMethod of Equal Shares (MES): Let bi be a (virtual) budget of voter i, initially set to k/n. The rule operates in rounds. We say that a not yet elected candidate c is p-affordable for p\u2208 R+, if its supporters can cover its (unit) cost in such a way that each of them pays p per unit of utility or all of their remaining funds. Hence, we calculate the minimum value of p that satisfies the expression \u2211iey min (bi, \u00b5\u2081(c) \u00b7 p) \u2265 1. In a given round the method selects the candidate that is p-affordable for the lowest possible value of p and updates the voters' budgets accordingly: b\u2081 := b; \u2212 min (b\u2081, \u03bc\u2081(c)\u00b7 \u03c1) before proceeding to the next round. The procedure stops if there is no p-affordable candidate for any finite value of p. This procedure may end with less than k candidates selected. To this end, in our experiments we will use the method with Add1U completion method [Faliszewski et al., 2023]. Additionally, the recently proposed Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending (BOS) [Papasotiropoulos et al., 2024], a robust variant of MES that balances proportionality and efficiency, will also be explored in our simulations."}, {"title": "Group Selection Rules for Networks", "content": "A natural approach to selecting influential nodes in a network is to choose the nodes of highest centrality. In the context of liquid democracy, Boldi et al. [2011] proposed selecting the k nodes with the highest PageRank, a method we refer to as TopRANK. This accounts for the diminishing trust along delegation paths. Proportionality has been identified as a key open research direction in the field [Brill, 2018]. By TOPKATZ, we denote the analogous rule for Katz centrality. As we will show, these rules may severely fail to represent the network proportionally. In response, we propose two general approaches, which constitute our main conceptual contribution."}, {"title": "Election-Based Group Selection", "content": "The first approach leverages proportional committee election rules. At a high level, it transforms the input graph into an election scenario based on nodes' importance and applies a voting rule to select representatives. Specifically, for any two distinct nodes u and v, it defines a utility for node u derived from including node v in the selected set. Such an assessment can be derived from most centrality measures in a natural way, but can also be the result of a link prediction, similarity measures, or a machine learning model. For PageRank, with a decay factor a, we define u(u, v) as the expected number of visits at v of the random walk that starts at node u, based on Equation (1):\n$$\\mu_G(u, v) := \\sum_{(u_1,u_2,...,u_k,v)\\in\\Omega(G):u=u_1} \\frac{\\alpha^k}{\\prod_{i=1}^k deg^+(u_i)}$$\nAccording to this function, the utility is high if node v can be reached with high probability from u. If we interpret edges as votes' delegation, the node to which a vote can be delegated more directly is preferred. Note that PRC(v) = \u03a3\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5(u, v), so TopRANK is equivalent to AV rule applied to election (V, V,\u00b5\u0152). Instead, we use the Method of Equal Shares due to its well-known proportionality guarantees, resulting in a rule we refer to as MESRANK:\nMESRANK(G, k) = MES((V, V,\u00b5\u03be), k).\nFor Katz centrality the definition of a utility function is analogous, but based on Equation (2), and this gives rise to a rule that we will call MESKATZ.\nPageRank and, in particular, the utility function from Equation (3), can be computed in polynomial time [Langville and Meyer, 2006]. The same applies to the Method of Equal Shares. Hence, the outcome of MESRANK can be computed in polynomial time; the same holds for MESKATZ."}, {"title": "Absorbing Rules", "content": "The second approach we propose is directly inspired by a scenario where voters delegate their votes to others and we need to select a group, SC V, to represent the whole electorate. Clearly, the selected voters do not need to delegate their votes further (as they represent themselves), so we can say that they \"absorb\" the chain of delegations. Thus, for an arbitrary centrality measure F, where FG(i) indicates the centrality of node i in G, the importance of each of the selected nodes i \u2208 S can be defined as FG-E+(S)(i), where the graph G - E+(S) is obtained by removing outgoing edges of all nodes from S. Now, we assess the group of selected nodes S C C by the least important node:\n$$F_G(S) = \\min_{i \\in S} F_{G-E^+(S)}(i)$$\nThe idea is that every node in the selected group should have sufficiently large support from nodes not already represented by other nodes. The group selection rule chooses the group that maximizes this score. This approach combined with PageRank gives a rule, that we will call ABSORBRANK:\n$$ABSORBRANK(G, k) = arg \\max_{S \\subseteq V,|S|=k} PR_{G-E^+(S)}^{\\alpha \\rightarrow 1}(S)$$\nWe maximize the decay factor by setting \u03b1 \u2192 1. In this way, we obtain an idealized version of PageRank that does not take the length of a walk into account.\nABSORBKATZ can be defined analogously, with the difference that we take \u03b1 \u2192 1/\u03bb. We note that PageRank with \u03b1 \u2192 1 and Katz centrality with \u03b1 \u2192 1/\u03bb are closely related to other centrality measures called Seeley index [Seeley, 1949] and eigenvector centrality [Bonacich, 1972], respectively; see [W\u0105s and Skibski, 2021] for a detailed discussion.\nWe prove that the outcomes of ABSORBRANK and ABSORBKATZ, unlike that of MESRANK and MESKATZ, cannot be computed in polynomial time (unless P=NP). This aligns with prior work identifying NP-hardness results for group centrality measures [Zhao et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2016, Angriman et al., 2021], making it of independent interest."}, {"title": "Theorem 1.", "content": "Given an input (G, k) it is NP-hard to compute ABSORBRANK(G, k) and ABSORBKATZ(G, k).\nWe note that the proof of Theorem 1 does not rely on the fact that \u03b1 \u2192 1 and extends to all variants of ABSORBRANK regardless of the choice of \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). In turn, given the intractability result, for our experiments, we will use heuristic approximations that take an arbitrary \u03b1 and proceed sequentially. Specifically, SEQABSORBRANK works in k iterations, in each selecting node i that maximizes PR(S \u222a {i}), where S contains all nodes selected so far."}, {"title": "Case Studies", "content": "In this section, we illustrate our methods using two specific classes of graphs: bipartite and functional, as defined in Section 2. In these graph families proportionality can be intuitively captured, and hence they can be seen as a first way of examining proportionality achieved by the proposed methods and how they differentiate among them. Bipartite graphs mimic the scenario of representative democracy, where the set of candidates is separate from the set of voters. Functional graphs can be viewed as elections with 1-approval ballots (where each voter supports at most one candidate) and they serve as a widely studied case in the liquid democracy literature. They were also the exclusive focus of Boldi et al. [2011]. Importantly, the outcome of all the examined rules can be computed in polynomial time in both of these graph families."}, {"title": "Theorem 2.", "content": "ABSORBRANK(G, k) and ABSORBKATZ(G, k) can be computed in polynomial time when G is a functional or a bipartite graph."}, {"title": "Bipartite Graphs", "content": "We begin with directed bipartite graphs that are particularly able to highlight the differences between measures based on PageRank and Katz centrality, as well as the characteristic behavior of proportional election rules combined with network centrality measures. We assume that more than k nodes have incoming edges; otherwise, the examined problem becomes trivial. Since there are only walks of length 0 and 1, the Katz centrality and PageRank of each node v can be easily determined. Specifically, if v belongs to V\u2081, its centrality is minimal, i.e., PR(v) = K&(v) = 1. Conversely, if v belongs to V2, then:\n$$PR(v) = 1 + \\sum_{(u,v)} \\frac{\\alpha}{deg^+(u)}$$\n$$K_G^{\\alpha}(v) = 1 + \\alpha deg(v)$$\nIn words, nodes in V2 get \u03b1 per incoming edge under Katz centrality, and \u03b1 divided by the number of outgoing edges of each supporting voter under PageRank. As a result, TOPKATZ simplifies to Approval Voting in this election instance, and TOPRANK simplifies to Satisfaction Approval Voting. We highlight that since \"candidate\" nodes in V2 have no outgoing edges, ABSORBKATZ and ABSORBRANK yield the same results as TOPKATZ and TOPRANK, respectively.\nThe approach based on the Method of Equal Shares works differently. The utility that node u gets from selecting node v is \u00b5\u00bf(u, v) = \u03b1/ deg+(u) for PageRank and \u00b5\u338f(u, v) = \u03b1 for Katz centrality. Consequently, MESKATZ corresponds to the result of running MES when all non-zero utilities are equal to \u03b1, while MESRANK splits \u03b1 among all approved by u candidates."}, {"title": "Functional Graphs", "content": "We now consider graphs in which every node has out-degree of at most one. PageRank and Katz centralities are identical on such graphs, hence, for ease of exposition, our analysis will center on rules based on PageRank. For simplicity, we assume that the decay factor approaches 1 for all considered rules: \u03b1 \u2192 1. In this case, if a node does not lie on any cycle, the PageRank of a node is nearly equal to its number of predecessors. More precisely, if |Pred(u)| > |Pred(v)|, then PRC\u21921(u) > PR&\u21921(v).\nWe begin with an analysis of paths. Consider a path of length n, and say that n is divisible by k. MESRANK views this instance as an election in which every node receives a utility of approximately 1 from each predecessor. Hence it selects the last k nodes of the path, as they have the maximum number of predecessors, clearly dominating the other nodes. The same holds for TOPRANK. However, ABSORBRANK behaves differently. The sink of the path will be again selected, but then, if the second-to-last node is selected, the sink will have no incoming edges in the graph G \u2013 E+(S), and its PageRank will be minimized. Therefore, the rule avoids such a selection. Instead, it aims to select nodes in such a way that they have equal support in the graph without their outgoing edges: it selects nodes n/k, 2 n/k, ..., n. For an illustration we refer to Figure 2.\nConsider now an arbitrary (connected) functional graph. Observe that such a graph consists of at most one cycle and in-trees attached to nodes from the cycle. Nodes from the cycle clearly have the maximal PageRank and have non-zero (close to 1) utility for all the nodes. Thus, if the cycle contains at least k nodes, then both TOPRANK and MESRANK would select only nodes from the cycle. If not, both methods select all nodes from the cycle and then some nodes from the attached in-trees. This is, however, where both methods begin to differ, and we refer to Figure 3 for a specific example. TOPRANK will select nodes with the highest number of predecessors. All such nodes may come from the same in-tree. However, from each in-tree MESRANK will select a number of nodes proportional to its size. Let us switch our attention to ABSORBRANK. If the graph contains a cycle, then ABSORBRANK would select one node from the cycle, say v. The graph G - E+(v) is a tree. Hence, roughly speaking, ABSORBRANK splits this tree into parts of equal size, and from each part selects its root.\nThe analysis of functional graphs shows an important difference in how ABSORBRANK and MESRANK interpret proportionality."}, {"title": "Axioms of Proportionality", "content": "We now introduce axioms to formalize the intuition that a sufficiently large and cohesive group of nodes deserves a proportional number of representatives. Our results (depicted in Table 1) shed further light on the differences among the examined rules. Specifically, our axioms are inspired by the literature on multiwinner election rules. Following the approach from works in this area (e.g., [Aziz et al., 2017]), the idea is that each node should have a significant influence over k/n of the committee. Consequently, a cohesive group S is entitled to [k. \\S\\/n] representatives. The key question, then, is: in the context of our study, which groups of nodes can be considered cohesive, and which nodes qualify as proper representatives of these groups?\nWe view a group of nodes as cohesive if all nodes mutually approve each other, either directly or indirectly. In graph terms, this means the group induces a strongly connected subgraph. We do so because in such groups, the importance is, to some extent, evenly distributed among its members. The most cohesive groups of nodes possible are the ones that form a component that is a clique.

Given this, ABSORBRANK violates Component-Entitlement because, depending on the structure, some components may be easier or harder to divide into several equal parts. As a result, it might be more beneficial to select an additional node from one component rather than another.

This is argued to better handle data with high variance in candidate utilities, a common characteristic of our model.

Our methods can be applied to elect a committee among a group of voters who vote amongst themselves (without a predetermined set of candidates). In the social choice literature, voters and candidates are often modeled as points in a two-dimensional Euclidean space, typically representing an ideological spectrum [Elkind et al., 2017]. Similarly, we assume that the nodes in our graph (representing both voters and candidates) correspond to points. These points are sampled from a specific distribution, which we describe later. Edges between nodes are introduced based on the distances between them, using one of four strategies. The first two strategies align with conventional assumptions in social choice, where voters are more likely to prefer candidates closer to them in the ideological space:\nE-radius: Each node connects (with a certain fixed probability) to the nodes within a specified radius.\nE-appr: Each node connects to a fixed number of its closest neighbors. To introduce some noise, we assume that each neighbor can be omitted with a fixed probability.\nWe also propose a novel Euclidean model, which is well aligned with the idea inspired by liquid democracy: that the voters tend to vote for their close friends (i.e., close points), yet in their preferences, exhibit a bias toward candidates with higher competence. In this model, each candidate is assigned an objective value representing their competence (represented as the y-coordinate). A node located at point (x, y) connects to the nodes closest to (x, y + b) rather than to itself, where b is a constant representing the competence bias. Variants of this model are denoted as B-radius and B-appr, respectively, depending on whether the voters tend to approve the candidates within a certain radius of acceptability or a certain number of candidates.\nFor each of these models, the points are drawn from two Gaussian distributions, with the points divided between the two groups in a 1:3 or 2: 3 ratio. From each setting, we sample 1000 instances. Each instance consists of n = 1000 points. For each instance, we construct a graph with n nodes and select k = 10 of them using one of our four methods combined with PageRank or Katz centrality. We identify the points corresponding to the selected nodes and mark them"}, {"title": "Outlook of the Experiments", "content": "Let us now discuss further conclusions coming from the experiments."}, {"title": "PageRank versus Katz Centrality", "content": "As a general rule, we observe that the straightforward approach of selecting the k nodes with the highest centralities leads to a more proportional representation under PageRank than under Katz centrality.

To some extend, this can be explained by the fact that in PageRank every node distributes its contribution evenly among the centralities of other nodes, leaving no possibility of increasing one's impact. In particular, PageRank significantly limits the influence of even the most influential nodes with higher out-degree.\nThe strict dampening of influence based on out-degree is often undesirable, making PageRank unsuitable for certain scenarios. For example, if we interpret edges as votes, PageRank extends satisfaction approval voting, while Katz follows the logic of approval voting (see Section 4.1). In social choice theory, approval voting is often considered the preferable method and is widely used in practice [Laslier and Sanver, 2010]. This observation is further supported by the first two columns of Figure 7, where PageRank tends to select more extremist nodes in the surrounding of the two Gaussians. This occurs because these nodes are less \u201cdistracted\u201d\u2014having fewer outgoing edges-making them more likely to be selected. In a way the candidates coming from less popular regions of voters preferences are additionally privileged, an arguably very undesired behaviour in election context. Additionally, the axiomatic analysis of PageRank per se suggests that it is unsuitable for certain applications [W\u0105s and Skibski, 2023]. In such applications, our work mitigates the limitations of PageRank by allowing the use of Katz centrality while still providing a method for selecting representative nodes."}, {"title": "Methods for Proportional Selection", "content": "We observe that all of our proposed methods enable a significantly more representative selection of nodes compared to the Top approach. The difference is particularly pronounced for Katz centrality, but even for PageRank we see noticeable improvements across different datasets. This effect is especially evident in Euclidean graphs (particularly in columns 1, 2, 7, and 8 of Figure 7) and in the College Football Network (see Section 6.1).\nAmong the studied rules, those based on the Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending-namely BOSRANK and BOSKATZ -yield the most representative committees, regardless of whether they are combined with PageRank or Katz centrality. Notably, even when these methods do not yield the best overall results, they never perform poorly in terms of proportionality in any of our examined scenarios.\nThe absorbing rules, on the other hand, prove more effective when used with PageRank rather than Katz, which is being also justified in our axiomatic analysis (Section 5). We highlight that this approach interprets proportionality differently, prioritizing representatives who minimize their maximum length of the influence propagation chain to non-selected voters, even if this means overlooking nodes that are highly influential in the original graph (see Section 4.2).\nThe universality of the Bos approach suggests that it is also a prefarable method to be combined with centrality measures beyond the ones studied in this paper as well as machine learning models."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "We introduced the problem of selecting k influential nodes from a network while ensuring proportional representation of different groups implicitly present in the structure of the network. We proposed two techniques of extending a given centrality measure to a proportional node-selection method, focusing on the PageRank and Katz centralities. Our theoretical studies and experimental analyses yield largely similar conclusions. Both of our techniques show a significant improvement over the Top approach"}]}

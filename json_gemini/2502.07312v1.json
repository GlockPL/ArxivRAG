We leverage knowledge distillation, specifically a simple distillation method inspired by DeepSeek-R1's CoT acquisition, combined with prompt hacking, to extract valuable training data from the Grok model. This data is then used to fine-tune a Phi-3-mini model, augmented with a mask-like mechanism specifically designed for handling the nuances of SNS data. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several SNS data processing tasks, out-performing existing models like Grok, Phi-3, and GPT-4. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our approach, including mathematical formulations, engineering details, ablation studies, and comparative evaluations.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Social Networking Services (SNS) generate vast amounts of data daily, presenting both opportunities and challenges for natural language processing (NLP). Extracting meaningful insights from this data requires models capable of handling its unique characteristics: short, informal text, rapid topic shifts, evolving slang, and a high degree of noise. Large Language Models (LLMs) like Grok show promise, but their size and computational cost can be prohibitive. Smaller, more efficient models like Phi-3-mini offer a practical alternative, but often lack the nuanced understanding required for SNS data.\nThis work bridges this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. We employ knowledge distillation to transfer the SNS-relevant knowledge from Grok to Phi-3-mini, significantly enhancing its performance without incurring the computational overhead of the larger model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mask-like mechanism that allows Phi-3-mini to effectively focus on the most relevant parts of SNS messages, mitigating the impact of noise and irrelevant information."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Knowledge Distillation", "content": "Knowledge distillation, initially proposed by Hinton et al.

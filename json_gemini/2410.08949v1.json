Therefore, due\nto its extremely high computational complexity and the lack of interpretability for sources, it is\noften neglected in the context of information fusion under the belief function framework.\nAccording to the Eqs. (3)(4) and (6), the a-junction can be written as\nm1\n\u03b1\nm2 = \u2211m\u2081 (F). Km2 = \u2211m\u2081 (F)mF\n\u03a3\n= {\u0e01,\u0e1a}. Hence, the major sources of computational complexity are the generation of\nK and m.\n\u03b1\nTheorem 4. The K can be implemented through the Kronecker multiplication of 2-dimensional\nmatrices.

Comparative analysis", "content": "In this paper, we achieve a quantized credal level without theoretical errors, owing to the\nmathematical consistency between the belief structure and the superposition state. Furthermore,\nwe will demonstrate that BACR and a-junction require fewer computational resources on quantum\ncircuits from the perspective of operation times.\nRemark 4. In quantum computing, computational complexity has various ways to be measured,\nsuch as circuit depth, number of elementary gates, etc. In this paper, the computational complexity\nof the fusion operation for multiple bodies of evidence is measured by the number of Toffoli gates.\nFor belief revision of a body of evidence, the complexity is determined by the number of single-bit\ncontrol gates.\nTheorem 6. Consider k mass functions m\u2081,\u2026\u2026, mk under an n-element FoD, their MFQSs are\ndenoted as m\u2081),\u2026\u2026,|mk). If the BACR with Boolean operation B = F\u2081\u2081 \u2229\u2229 Fir, i.e., multi-\nsource CCR, is implemented on quantum circuits, it will cost (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 n Toffoli gates.\nProof 6. According to the Definition 6, combining them via CCR needs n Ck-NOT gates. In\norder to implement it through Toffoli gates, (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 n ancilla bits should be introduced, which is\nused to store the intermediate states in evolutionary processes. Hence, (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 n Toffoli gates are\nneeded to implement the CCR of k mass functions on quantum circuits.\nTheorem 7. In classical works, the computational complexity of combining k mass functions un-\nder an n-element FoD using CCR depends on the types of mass functions involved. For a poss-\ntransferable mass function, the combination requires (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 n multiplications, while for a general\nmass function, it requires (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 2\u2033 multiplications.\nProof 7. Since the poss-transferable mass function satisfies combination rule consistency [44],\ni.e.,\nMPOSS1...

For the general mass\nfunctions, based on the Eq. (2), the CCR can be implement through the commonality functions\nqk+1 = q1 \u00b0\uff65\uff65\uff65 \u25cb qk with (k \u2212 1) \u00d7 2\u2033 multiplications.\nAccording to the Theorems 6 and 7, we conclude that while implementing CCR on quantum\ncircuits does not provide acceleration benefits for the poss-transferable mass function, it offers\nexponential acceleration for general mass functions. Remark 3 allows us to analyze the above phe-\nnomenon from the perspective of quantum entanglement. In quantum circuits, logic operations\nare implemented using control gates. When applied to qubits, these operations carry not only the\ninformation of the qubits themselves but also their entanglement information. In contrast, classical\nframeworks cannot inherently carry entanglement information through operations on correspond-\ning elements, requiring additional steps to transfer such information. For the poss-transferable\nmass function, where the corresponding MFQS is a separable quantum state, i.e., no entangle-\nment exists among qubits, applying logic operations on quantum circuits offers no advantage over\nclassical frameworks. In contrast, general mass functions typically have MFQSs containing en-\ntanglement information, resulting in an acceleration benefit when applying logical operations on\nquantum circuits."}, {"title": "4.4.

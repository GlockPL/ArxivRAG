Designers generally rely on participatory methods to identify, comprehend, and critically assess diverse needs and preferences from multi-stakeholders [e.g., 45, 56, 97, 109]. However, designers often struggle to successfully elicit how to represent different cultures and identities in the built environment due to existing asymmetries between themselves and different stakeholders, such as power dynamics, communication barriers, cultural sensibility, and access to resources and information [37, 55].\nTo facilitate conversations with stakeholders, designers often rely on tools and methods such as reference images, generative urban design models, and different technological platforms [e.g., 11, 19, 40, 67, 96, 97]. Despite such efforts, research has found that perspectives from various communities are still not equally incorporated into design outputs, often leaving out the needs of underrepresented groups and their cultural heritage [55, 67]. With the rapidly growing capabilities of image-generative artificial intelligence (IGAI), recent work advocates the potential of leveraging IGAI tools to support communication and collaboration between designers and their public stakeholders [50, 67]. We examine whether IGAI tools deliver their promise and identify issues that remain as obstacles to effective co-design processes [50, 105, 113, 129].\nApplying IGAI to support public engagement in designing public spaces opens up a new avenue for human-AI co-design. While leveraging generative AI's capabilities in design tasks has attained extensive research interests, the majority of such work focuses on how AI-powered tools augment the experience and performance of individual creators [e.g., 28, 29, 60, 73, 74, 122]. Commonly, individual creators have established preferences, targeted audiences, and clear expectations for how they might respond to new technologies and tools. By contrast, designing public spaces demands more extensive, multi-stakeholder involvement, while each participant lacks awareness of the other's needs and wants. Moreover, practitioners often encounter constraints from physical spaces and institutional hurdles. These challenges are less apparent to those without rich domain knowledge, making it more challenging to avoid design obstacles proactively.\nTo explore how IGAI could facilitate public space design, we conducted a case study using IGAI as a boundary object in interviews with young legal immigrants to elicit information for designing a public park in Los Angeles. Our study focuses on how designers and stakeholders interact and how IGAI shaped their discussion of experiences, needs, and desired qualities to design a more welcoming public space. We investigate the following question: How can IGAI support participatory processes when designers and stakeholders co-design public spaces? This study is part of a larger project that analyzes how technology can help spatialize translocality by identifying immigrants' desires, visions, and tensions in cultural and spatial negotiation.\nWe conducted a three-stage study to explore, examine, and reflect on the use of IGAI tools as boundary objects to mediate conversations between designers and stakeholders in public space design. We collected data and extracted insights from multiple interviews and workshops. We organize our findings into three themes as follows: (1) how multi-stakeholders jointly redefine successful generative output in IGAI-mediated participatory sessions, (2) how IGAI promoted space-aware conversations, and (3) how IGAI-mediated conversations are subject to the abilities of the facilitators in managing the interaction between themselves, the AI, and stakeholders. All these findings shift the focal point from \"Fake Perfects\u201d to \"Conversational Imperfects,\u201d suggesting that producing 'imperfect' results that prompt richer conversations should be prioritized over attaining accurate ('perfect') images in participatory processes.\nWe discuss three core contributions: First, we provide practical implications for designing technologies to seek public engagement in public space design. We discuss the need to shift from object- to process-oriented participatory methods; this implies future participatory tool design should focus on interfaces and features that enable moderators of a participatory session to probe richer conversations with their participants. Second, we discuss the importance of AI literacy, technical expertise, and soft skills to navigate conversations when adopting novel technologies to"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "The design of public spaces is often considered a wicked problem\u00b9 encompassing multiple dimensions [30, 100]. Spatial designers must address large-scale, complex environments that involve physical, social, and regulatory dimensions and multifunctional requirements derived from diverse stakeholders' needs, preferences, and expectations [7, 8, 52, 63, 76, 116, 123]. To do so, landscape designers must collaborate across disciplines, navigating a web of regulatory constraints and dynamic needs [46, 62] with care and contextual sensitivity [26, 86].\nWhen designing for public problems, participation is a core element in generating value for constituents [18, 22, 93, 102]. Participation can bring together diverse people, providing benefits such as access to experience-based knowledge, enhanced support and legitimacy, and improved inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability [4\u20136, 10]. However, participatory methods can also harm people when ill-implemented [37, 43, 61]. Too often, participation only simulates care and engagement, having limited impact on the outcomes of the public process [37, 124] and, thus, staying as an unfulfilled promise [83].\nLandscape designers often rely on participatory processes to encompass stakeholders' conflicting preferences. For example, space designers use methods such as design charrettes [80], design workshops [103], site walks [32, 70], design games [23], participatory mapping [33], public interventions and exhibitions [85, 104], and visual preference surveys [89] to involve communities in the design process, reflect on local and environmental considerations, and promote a sense of ownership [54].\nDespite employing various methods, traditional participatory approaches may not always be sufficient to capture all stakeholders' nuanced and diverse perspectives. Designers often encounter challenges in effectively eliciting how different cultures and identities wish to be represented in the built environment [55]. Neither treating all issues as design problems nor using participatory approaches are universal fixes [37, 39, 43]. Participatory design should be implemented through a collective task of caring and taking action for our future [26, 39], considering institutional constraints as a resource for new strategies [82]. However, to do so, designers must deal with the challenge of the existing asymmetries between them and the public [37, 55], how publics are constructed (i.e., who and how participate) [35, 38], and how objects can have a material agency and influence on the process [65].\nMany methods and tools described above can be conceptualized as boundary objects, which could bridge asymmetries between designers and stakeholders [77, 78]. Star [77] proposes three characteristics of boundary objects: they provide a common language between participants to share knowledge, enable individuals to learn their differences, and facilitate collaboration in transforming knowledge. Boundary objects in design can create friction and controversy to promote discussion and learn from differences [59], establish and destabilize protocols to push boundaries [75] and ground ideas and bridge language across different backgrounds and disciplines [12]."}, {"title": "2.1 Designing Public Spaces", "content": "The design of public spaces is often considered a wicked problem\u00b9 encompassing multiple dimensions [30, 100].

[129] for a review). A growing body of work has recently explored IGAI's potential in supporting various design tasks, demonstrating how IGAI applications could be incorporated into individual creators' workflows. The use of IGAI tools for design support can range from probing design questions and collecting relevant information [29, 60, 111], exploring different ideas [28, 60, 84, 98, 121, 126], to verifying the feasibility of design [57, 60, 98, 111]. However, designing public spaces grapples with a unique set of challenges (as mentioned in Section 2.1), and the utility of IGAI tools in addressing them remains underexplored.\nSome generative tools have been tested in areas of landscape architecture. For example, in designing landscapes, Huang et al. [57] developed PlantoGraphy, a design system that allows an interactive configuration of IGAI to transform conceptual scenes into realistic landscape renderings. However, the system has limited flexibility in accommodating more diverse design requirements, which is a relevant challenge when designing complex public spaces. Guridi et al. [50] discussed how IGAI could increase efficiency, multiplicity, and stakeholder engagement in co-designing public parks. Jiang et al. [67] conducted a systematic review of the generative urban design field and found that models are yet to address the complexity of the required elements, focusing primarily on single-element design such as streets and buildings [81, 128]. However, most research focuses on the quantitative performance of the urban design (e.g., traffic, energy efficiency) [67, 71, 118] or high-quality images [57], which can fail to promote divergent thinking and holistic design options.\nA particular role we highlight is how IGAI can become a boundary object between designers and stakeholders. Boundary objects support translation between social worlds [75, 77, 78] seeking to arrive at a mutual understanding. However, boundary objects have their innate subjectivity and ambiguity, sometimes making their role in translation difficult, failing to satisfy the informational needs of the parties, or requiring additional explanations to be intelligible [53, 75, 114]. Recent studies analyzed IGAI as boundary objects in art creation [29], but no work is related to participatory processes or landscape design.\nHowever, using IGAI to support the design process entails risks. IGAI could harm people through different mechanisms such as generating offensive content [105], producing content biased in cultural, racial, or other relevant dimensions [13, 95, 113, 119, 131], generating hard to identify fake content when the truth is expected [34, 99, 108], plagiarism [47], among others.\nIn terms of interaction, the HCI field has long studied how human-AI (HAII) interaction is challenging, especially involving language technologies [e.g., 69, 107, 115, 126, 127]. The HAII depends on personal traits [42], highly varying between individuals [107]. However, in the field of tools to support design, little research has delved into the details of HAII, leaving users largely hands-off during the experience [60]. For example, Chiou et al. [28] analyze the communication challenge in the designer-IGAI interaction and propose using design frameworks to aid in prompting generation. The latter is important since research suggests that the effectiveness of co-design with Al rests on participants' chosen approach to prompt creation and their responses to the Al's suggestions [120]. Thus, designers might experience changes in how they work when incorporating IGAI. Chiou et al., [28] found that designers might experience a transition from a creator to a curator role. The latter could conflict with the actual adoption of the tools since designers could resist them if they lack agency or are not provided with explanations, instructions, or proper co-design frameworks [90, 130]."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "This study is part of a broader project to understand how to map immigrant preferences and uses of public space through technology to foster inclusive design and management of the urban commons.

These interviews aimed to analyze the information and see how memories and cultural heritage could inform the transformation of the Puente Hills Landfill into a park\u00b2. Interviews in this stage elicited information about the public spaces that participants frequented and their use of social media. We asked what type of public spaces they use and why, what they do in those public spaces, and how they use social media in relation to those spaces. Moreover, we asked participants to think about the public parks they visited and the elements they valued and deemed missing. Finally, we asked them about Puente Hill Landfill and the elements they wanted to see when it became a park."}, {"title": "3.2 Stage 1: Speculative Process", "content": "The first stage's goal was to explore the opportunities and challenges of using IGAI to support the design of public spaces. We assembled a team of students and professors in landscape architecture to use IGAI as a design probe [87] and reflect on opportunities and desires emerging from using IGAI in participatory design. During 6 months, the team worked on generating prompts from the first set of interviews (table 2). To do so, the team coded the transcripts using aspects of the Convivial Public Space Framework [109, 110]: Place, Activity, Features, Emotion, and Sense of Place. Then, the team extracted keywords to develop the prompts and generated images of the parks described during the interviews, with and without reference images. We include a sample of prompts and images from this prior work in annex B. During the whole process, the team documented their experience.\nTo debrief the experience, we conducted four interviews with four team members (i.e., the researchers with a Landscape Architecture background) and organized a two-hour reflection workshop to discuss the main insights from using IGAI and the envisioned challenges of this method in real-time during the interviews. The main insights of this work served as the base for designing stages 2 and 3 and were published earlier in 2024 [50]."}, {"title": "3.3 Stage 2: Piloting Process", "content": "The second stage's goal was to design and test a protocol for using IGAI in a real-world intervention based on the insights from Stage 1.

To do so, the three research assistants who would prompt the system in the real-world experience interviewed three of the team's researchers. During this stage, we focused only on the first section of the interview, about memories in a public space (see table 6). We analyzed the interviews to design the final protocol and to further reflect on the results of Stage 1."}, {"title": "3.4 Stage 3: IGAI-mediated interviews", "content": "The third stage aimed to test IGAI as boundary objects between designers and stakeholders.

We mainly used Dream Studio, but some specific tests were done with DALL-E 3, and Photoshop with Generative AI. Appendix A provides a succinct description of each software.\nThe interview script was an adapted version of the one used during the 2023 interviews and described above in section 3.2. We kept it as similar as possible, incorporating only the prototyping exercises with IGAI, modifying the section about Puente Hills Landfill to the River Garden Park, and deleting questions about social media that were no longer relevant. The interviews included three phases, and the researchers only moved forward when either the participant was satisfied with an image, no improvements were achieved after three iterations, or the interviewee had nothing more to say about the images. The goal of phase 1 was to illustrate a significant memory of the participant in a public park. During this phase, the interviewees described an existing place and, alongside the facilitator and the prompter, tried to generate an illustration of that space and discuss their feelings about it. The goal of Phase 2 was to discuss the public spaces that the participants often go to and, from that, co-design an ideal one for them. The final phase consisted of presenting a set of pictures of River Garden Park and, from one that was picked by the interviewee, working together on upgrading the space. Each interview was done in English and lasted approximately 60 minutes.\nParticipants were recruited by a nonprofit NGO working together with our industry partner to upgrade Rivergarden Park in Los Angeles.

The proposed categories are not exhaustive, but we propose them as analytical concepts from our findings. From our case, we extract three main findings analyzing the dynamics of the Fake Perfects and Conversational Imperfects: (1) Success in IGAI is resignified from accurate to imperfect, conversational images, (2) \u2019Conversational Imperfects' promoted space-aware conversations, and (3) generative results are subject to practitioners managing reactions and interactions with the IGAI.\nThe following subsections explain our findings and provide evidence using images from the IGAI-mediated interviews and quotes from the interviews and workshops of the stages described in table 1. Participants are identified in accordance to the information in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5. The phases of the IGAI-mediated interviews are summarized in table 6. We use the following terminology to refer to the different groups. \"Participants\" are people recruited and interviewed; \"facilitators\" are researchers guiding the interviews; \"prompters\" are research assistants using the IGAI during interviews; and \"practitioners\" are researchers, research assistants, and people from our partnering firm with landscape architecture background."}, {"title": "4.1 Finding 1: Success in IGAI is resignified from accurate to imperfect, conversational images", "content": "Consistent with the existing literature, practitioners acknowledged the iterative nature of working with IGAI during the design processes. However, practitioners who experienced frustration during stages 1 and 2 changed their minds when using IGAI in a real-world context in stage 3. Practitioners identified the benefits of those imperfect, intermediate outputs during the iterative processes of collaborating through image generation.\nThese distinct experiences could be attributed to their goals when IGAI was used as a medium for collaboration. In alignment with the current prompting convention [129], the goals of practitioners in stages 1 and 2 focused on creating \"accurate images\u201d to represent and communicate their visions precisely. This focus on accuracy often yielded frustration, and unexpected outputs were viewed as malperformance of IGAI or lack of capacities from the prompter. As researchers suggested: \u201cIt took at least four or five changes to get a satisfactory picture. Sometimes, we felt a later picture was even worse than the first one.\u201d (D1) and \u201cThere is a limited range of manipulation of images with prompts, potentially leading to significant differences [from expectations] and omissions of key elements\u201d (D2).\nIn stark contrast, when generating images to mediate the conversation in stage 3, practitioners held distant opinions toward what were deemed as successful outcomes of prompting and working iteratively with IGAI. In particular, we distilled two dynamics in which Conversational Imperfects (i.e., 'imperfect' images) were successful: (1) revealing hidden or unknown ideas and (2) inspiring new ideas."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Revealing hidden or unknown ideas", "content": "Conversational Imperfects, not necessarily aligned with traditional success metrics, revealed hidden or unknown ideas from participants. Through unexpected components and arrangements, images triggered memories, surprised the participants, and suggested follow-up questions to the facilitator.

For example, one participant expressed he liked fungi, and the IGAI generated a fantastical park where all elements were based on them (see figure 2). This image prompted ideas about designing using natural elements, which can lead to more sustainable spaces. In the practitioners' words, using IGAI \"has the potential to prompt and facilitate imaginative outputs\u201d (F3). A researcher had similar reflections: \u201cWhimsical unrealistic images can be generative in helping participants to think more creatively\u201d (F10) and a practitioner added \u201cEven absurd images can be analyzed through a spatial lens to enrich design thinking for transformation beyond banal reproductions of what is already known\u201d (F2)."}, {"title": "4.2 Finding 2: IGAI promoted space-aware conversations", "content": "Conversations using IGAI as a boundary object promoted space-aware descriptions and experiential dynamics. Compared with the interviews conducted without IGAI, we observed that participants improved their descriptions of the space and their position within it. Participants suggested that articulating and crystalizing ideas through IGAI is particularly helpful for public space design, allowing them to be more concrete. First, participants tended to elaborate on more information about the spaces and their constraints when the generative outputs missed critical details and became Conversational Imperfects. Second, echoing prior public space design literature, participants rarely came to clear, actionable design ideas in the first place; however, as they talked about the spaces, they deliberated more about the hidden design constraints and the relationships between people and the environments. Finally, visual outputs supported more effective communication of these complex concepts. As such, we saw participants adopting more precise language and referencing the images to describe ideas for design.

For instance, one participant described her memory as follows (see figure 3a): \u201cIt's been a while since I last went. It was nice. They had an inside and outside basketball court. And then they had, I think, two baseball courts. It was a pretty big park\u201d (E3).\nThe image was far from accurate and contained a lot of imperfections, such as the mixed sports fields. The errors facilitated the discussion, prompting follow-up questions and more specific descriptions by looking at the image and providing specific references to improve it:\nThe playground would be far right. And then, in front of the playground, there was a soccer field. And then towards the end, there was a basketball court, and then in the middle, there was a field, so that's where they played baseball, and then more towards the left, there was another big field (...) There should be trees, but it's like that [pointing to the image], far back. (E3)\nThen, she incorporated information about her position in the space and the atmosphere. Although the final result is still inaccurate (see figure 3b), she could point us to where in the space she used to hang out and the kind of atmosphere and set-up she liked. The participant described her position, pointing to different sections in the image. \u201cWe're here, instead of here. This is my point of view if I were to be in the playground, and this would be my aunt's point of view. The soccer field would have been here, and then the basketball court would have been over here\u201d (E3).\nThe latter description and interaction, prompted by Conversational Imperfects, contrasts with 1-shot descriptions during the interviews in 2023 in which participants described more activities rather than details about their position in the space:"}, {"title": "4.2.2 Promoting experiential dynamics", "content": "Using IGAI during the interview promoted a more active engagement since iterations over the images required interaction.

We found a disconnection in how the success of generative output is evaluated by IGAI designers versus public space designers.\nInstead of focusing on realistic images that perfectly align with the text prompts, practitioners highlighted that generative images saw the greatest potential to prompt richer, more participatory conversations when they were imperfect. Conversations mediated by IGAI became more space-aware and revealed hidden values and ideas. However, we also found that the generative results of using IGAI depended on how facilitators managed the experience.\nBelow, we reflect on how our findings point to further research on participatory methods using IGAI for public spaces. Moreover, we discuss how the HCI and CSCW communities could extend their research regarding IGAI from the designer-AI interaction dyad to HAII in a multistakeholder situation in real-world applications."}, {"title": "5.1 IGAI as Design Support: From Object- to Process-Oriented Methods", "content": "Our findings suggest a shift from object-oriented to process-oriented methods for the participatory design of public spaces. We reflect on three elements we distill from our findings: success metrics, the synchronicity of design narratives, and the interactive dynamics between practitioners, IGAI, and stakeholders. All three elements suggest that using the IGAI centers the experience in the conversation rather than the object itself. It is less important to achieve a high-quality sketch or a"}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In today's digital age, natural language processing (NLP) technology is changing our lives at an unprecedented rate [1]. From intelligent customer service to personalized recommendation systems, to voice recognition and translation, NLP is becoming a bridge between people and information [2]. With the advancement of technology, it has penetrated into every corner of daily life, greatly improving efficiency and enriching user experience [3]. For example, in the field of healthcare, NLP technology can help doctors quickly and accurately understand medical records and improve diagnostic efficiency; in the field of education, it can provide personalized tutoring suggestions based on students' learning progress; and in the business field, companies can use NLP to analyze market trends and optimize products and services [4]. However, as these technologies are increasingly used, how to ensure the security and privacy of user data while enjoying convenience has become one of the urgent issues to be solved [5].\nIn the context of the booming development of big data and artificial intelligence, personal privacy protection has become a global issue [6]. In particular, NLP technology requires a large amount of text data as training materials, which often contains users' personal information and behavioral habit [7]s. Once this sensitive information is improperly used or leaked, it may cause unpredictable risks to users, such as identity theft, financial losses, and even threats to personal safety. Therefore, when designing and applying NLP-related technologies, balancing the relationship between technological innovation and privacy protection, ensuring that user data is properly handled, and avoiding infringing personal privacy, is a common focus of attention within and outside the industry. To reduce the risk of data leakage, enterprises and developers must adopt measures such as data desensitization and anonymization.\nIn order to meet this challenge, researchers are exploring a variety of privacy protection technologies to protect user data security without affecting the performance of NLP systems. Differential privacy technology can protect personal privacy by adding random noise to cover up individual data characteristics while ensuring the accuracy of data analysis results."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Privacy protection in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical area of research, with various approaches designed to safeguard sensitive user data while maintaining the efficiency of NLP systems. One method that has gained prominence is differential privacy, which allows for secure data processing by adding noise to sensitive information without compromising the performance of the model. The issue of bias in deep learning optimization also plays a significant role in privacy protection. To address this, advanced optimization techniques have been proposed to reduce bias during model training, enhancing the fairness and privacy integrity of the resulting models [11]. Additionally, the development of adaptive friction mechanisms for optimizers has provided further improvements in deep learning frameworks, ensuring that data can be processed efficiently while protecting sensitive information [12].\nIn the domain of model accuracy, research on multimodal fusion strategies has shown that combining different data modalities can improve the accuracy of deep learning systems. Such methodologies can be adapted to NLP tasks to ensure privacy-preserving data processing by reducing the risks associated with handling large-scale sensitive datasets [13]. Recent work in question generation within large language models has explored the integration of advanced contrastive learning techniques, contributing to the robustness of privacy-preserving mechanisms in NLP systems [14].\nAdvances in neural network architectures, particularly the use of Dense U-Net with channel attention, have demonstrated significant potential for optimizing data integrity in deep learning models. This work primarily focused on unsupervised registration, the underlying techniques can be applied to enhance privacy-preserving methods in NLP by ensuring secure data handling and feature extraction [15]. Likewise, research on lightweight GAN-based algorithms highlights the importance of optimizing model efficiency for secure data fusion, contributing to the development of privacy-aware NLP systems [16-18]. Handling large and complex datasets is another challenge in privacy-sensitive environments. Recent efforts in spatiotemporal feature representation and mining provide key insights into how to manage and secure large-scale text data, which is crucial for privacy preservation in NLP [19]. Similarly, optimization algorithms for text classification, particularly those based on graph neural networks, have contributed significantly to the effective processing of large datasets while maintaining data security and privacy [20].\nEfforts to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in deep learning models also support the broader goal of privacy protection. By applying strategies that reduce unintended bias in models, privacy risks during data processing can be minimized, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected without sacrificing model accuracy [21]. Furthermore, advancements in transformer networks, particularly in attention mechanisms, have shown how model architectures can be tailored to enhance privacy in sensitive data applications, including NLP [22]. Other significant contributions have come from work on attention mechanisms and context modeling systems, which have demonstrated how these techniques can enhance the privacy of NLP systems by improving the security of data processing tasks [23]. Additionally, the development of U-structure neural networks for deep learning-based segmentation tasks has provided insights into the optimization of data processing systems, contributing to improved privacy protection in data-driven applications [24]. Finally, several studies have highlighted the optimization of neural networks for diverse data types. Research on survival prediction using neural networks underscores the adaptability of deep learning techniques for privacy-centric environments, ensuring sensitive data is processed securely while maintaining model performance [25]. Moreover, enhancements in convolutional neural networks using higher-order numerical methods offer a pathway for improving model efficiency in NLP tasks, contributing to the development of privacy-preserving systems [26]. Efforts to create adaptive feature interaction models have further refined how complex datasets are processed securely, particularly in sensitive data environments such as digital finance, offering important implications for NLP systems [27]."}, {"title": "III. METHOD", "content": "A key approach to privacy protection in natural language processing (NLP) is to use differential privacy technology. Differential privacy is a powerful privacy protection mechanism that aims to minimize the impact on individual data records while providing useful statistical information. The basic idea is to add random noise to the data set so that the analysis results cannot be used to infer information about specific individuals.\nFirst, define the basic parameter $\\epsilon$ (epsilon) of differential privacy, which is a measure of the privacy budget. The smaller the $\\epsilon$, the stronger the privacy protection provided. In addition, it is necessary to set a parameter $\\delta$ (delta), which is used to control the low-probability events of privacy leakage risk. These two parameters together determine the strength of differential privacy. In order to achieve differential privacy during model training, Gaussian noise can be added to the gradient before each gradient update. Assume that the current model parameter is $\\Theta$ and the loss function is $L(\\Theta; D)$, where represents the training dataset. In the standard gradient descent update, the parameter update rule is as follows:\n$\\Theta'=\\Theta-\\eta\\nabla L(\\Theta; D)$\nHere, $\\eta$ is the learning rate. To introduce a differential privacy, we need to modify this updated rule. We first need to introduce a gradient clipping strategy to ensure that its norm does not exceed a predetermined maximum value C. Clipping can prevent a single data point from having too much influence on the gradient update, thereby protecting privacy. The clipped gradient $\\nabla'L(\\Theta; D)$ is defined as:\n$\\nabla' L(\\Theta; D) = min(1, \\frac{C}{|| \\nabla L(\\Theta; D) ||_2})\\nabla L(\\Theta; D)$\nAmong them, $||\u00b7||_2$ represents the L2 norm. Adding Gaussian noise: Next, Gaussian noise is added to the clipped gradient.\nThe noise term $N(0,\\sigma^2I)$ is sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix $\\sigma^\u1fbdI$ (where I is the identity matrix). The standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the noise can be calculated by the following formula to satisfy the definition of differential privacy:\n$\\sigma=\\frac{\\sqrt{2ln(1/\\delta)}}{\\epsilon}$\nIn this way, the noisy gradient update rule becomes:\n$\\Theta'= \\Theta-\\eta(\\nabla'L(\\Theta; D) + N(0, \\sigma^2\u0399))$\nIn this way, we can effectively enhance the privacy protection of data without significantly affecting the model training effect. Through the above steps, we can introduce differential privacy protection mechanism in the NLP model training process. First, the size of the gradient is limited by gradient clipping, and then the update direction of the model is blurred by adding Gaussian noise, thereby achieving privacy protection for the original data. By adjusting the values of $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$, a suitable balance between privacy protection and model performance can be flexibly found."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENT", "content": "The data set for this article is derived from the analysis of the trends of the publication of 50 personal privacy protection policies and regulations in the United States. They can be roughly divided into three stages: the initial stage, the rising stage, and the mature stage. The first stage is the initial stage of the legal system (before the 1990s). As early as before the 1970s, the United States had begun to explore personal privacy protection. The laws and policy provisions related to personal privacy protection mainly came from the Constitution and the Basic Law of the State. The promulgation of the Privacy Act in the 1980s laid the foundation for personal privacy protection. The second stage is the development stage from 1990 to 2010. During this stage, with the development of computer technology and Internet technology, the focus of personal privacy protection practices in the United States was mainly on website personal privacy protection. The third stage is from 2010 to the present. During this stage, with the in-depth development of Internet technology and the advent of the big data era, personal privacy protection is more focused on the data level. How to protect personal privacy security has received more attention from government departments and the public, marking the legislative practice of personal privacy protection policies in the United States.\nPolicy texts are diverse in type, complex in structure, and have many elements. They are also noisy. After crawling and collecting privacy statements from libraries at all levels, data cleaning and preprocessing operations are required. For the data in this article, Python's nltk method is used to remove stop words from English words, and restore the capitalization and part of speech of the words to make the form of all English words consistent, which is convenient for subsequent model training."}, {"title": "V.

When these modalities are combined, they can significantly enhance our understanding of neural mechanisms. Prior multimodal studies fusing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) have shown the advantages of this approach. Typically, because sMRI data lacks temporal dimension, existing fusion methods focus on compressing all the temporal information in fMRI into a single summary measure. This can be seen in methods like fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional network connectivity (FNC). However, these approaches sacrifice the rich temporal dynamics captured in the original four-dimensional fMRI data. Building on the observation from prior research that covarying networks identified via SMRI show some correspondence to those observed in resting-state fMRI networks, we have developed a novel fusion method by combining the strength of deep learning frameworks and independent component analysis (ICA), named copula linked parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). This method not only estimates independent sources and an unmixing matrix for each imaging modality but also links the spatial sources of fMRI and sMRI using a novel model that incorporates copulas to build our fusion approach. This linkage allows for a more sophisticated and flexible integration of temporal and spatial information compared to the traditional methods, by allowing for varying similar spatial relationships. We evaluated the efficacy of CLIP-ICA through rigorous testing in both simulated and real-world scenarios, utilizing data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Jack et al., 2008), including both fMRI and sMRI datasets. Our findings demonstrated that CLiP-ICA could effectively capture both strongly and weakly linked sMRI and fMRI networks, including the cerebellum, sensorimotor, visual, cognitive control and the default mode networks. The CLiP-ICA revealed a greater number of meaningful components and fewer artifact components (50 resting state networks and 45 intrinsic structural networks out of 75), helping to address the long-standing optimum model order problem in ICA. Additionally, CLiP-ICA detected complex FNC patterns across different stages of cognitive decline, with CN subjects generally exhibiting higher connectivity within the sensorimotor and visual networks compared to those with AD. Interestingly, a transient increase in connectivity was observed in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms. Additionally, the method introduced a new metric, structural network covariation (SNC), to measure structural atrophy on the functionally coupled networks. Overall, CLiP-ICA offers a robust approach for linking multimodal data with mismatched dimensionality, revealing meaningful neural relationships that may remain hidden with traditional methods.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used blind source separation method for studying brain imaging data from various modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) (Agcaoglu, Silva, et al., 2022; Calhoun, & Adal\u0131, 2012; Cetin et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2021; Rashid et al., 2019; Treacher et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2010). ICA decomposes brain imaging data into maximally independent networks by assuming that the observed data is a mixture of independent sources. It aims to identify these sources by maximizing their statistical independence based on known or assumed probability distributions. The independence assumption implies that the joint probability distribution of the sources is the product of their individual distributions. Our research primarily utilizes the linear mixing model, with the goal of deriving an optimal linear unmixing matrix that effectively separates the mixed signals into maximally statistically independent components (Hyvarinen et al., 2000).\nSeveral extensions of ICA have been created for multimodal fusion of brain imaging data, including Joint ICA (JICA) (Calhoun et al., 2009), Parallel ICA (Liu et al., 2007), Parallel multilink joint ICA (Khalilullah et al., 2023; Khalilullah et al., 2024) canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Correa et al., 2008; Sui et al., 2018), independent vector analysis (IVA) (Adali et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2006; Li et al., 2023), multi-view ICA (Richard et al., 2020), Bayesian linked tensor ICA (LICA) (Groves et al., 2011), and multiset independent subspace analysis (Silva et al., 2021). However, existing methods may still fail to capture the full interplay between sources in different modalities. For example, methods like CCA focus on uncorrelated sources, ignoring higher order statistical information. jICA assumes modalities have the same mixing matrices, CCA and IVA also often assume specific distributional forms for connected sources in multiple methods. Additionally, these methods do not fully consider the complete information in the case of mismatched dimensionality (e.g., 3D vs 4D), often pre-reducing the 4D fMRI data to 3D features, such as fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) or regional homogeneity, and thus do not consider the temporal information in the data fusion. Even in some deep learning approaches, (Fedorov et al., 2024) used reduced fMRI features, fALFF, while fusing structural and functional data.\nA recent method called parallel group ICA + ICA (Qi et al., 2019) focuses on 4D fMRI data by maximizing the correlation between the loading parameters of sMRI and the temporal variation in fMRI loading parameters. However, this approach does not leverage the similarity in spatial patterns between fMRI and sMRI (Luo, Sui, Abrol, Chen, et al., 2020). Semi-blind or spatially constrained approaches (Calhoun et al., 2005; Du et al., 2013; Du et al., 2020) can help with this i.e., using a common template in a spatially constrained ICA framework, allowing the fusion of sMRI with complete 4D fMRI data, but have not fully been introduced within a fusion setting (Kotoski et al., 2024).\nExpanding on these concepts, and motivated by prior work that showed covarying sMRI networks resemble resting fMRI networks (Luo, Sui, Abrol, Chen, et al., 2020), we introduce a copula-based joint ICA model (Agcaoglu et al., 2024), which proves effective in identifying true sources under noisy conditions by leveraging connections between components from different modalities. Recently, we proposed a method tailored for scenarios where loading parameters are distinct, and sources exhibit topological similarity of varying degrees linked via a copula model (Agcaoglu, 2024). This model is termed copula-linked Parallel ICA (CLiP-ICA). CLiP-ICA capitalizes on relationships across different modalities, estimating linked components with higher model order and simultaneously determining functional network connectivity (FNC). CLiP-ICA also allows us to naturally improve estimates of linked sMRI/fMRI components while also capturing modality-unique (unlinked) components as well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CLiP-ICA model through simulations and its application to real data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study (Jack et al., 2008)."}, {"title": "II. METHODS", "content": "In this section, we begin by introducing the proposed CLiP-ICA method (Agcaoglu, 2024), providing a detailed explanation of its theoretical foundation and the formulation of the cost function. We then discuss the practical applications of the method, highlighting its relevance to multimodal neuroimaging data analysis.\nFollowing the theoretical exposition, we describe a simulation designed to evaluate the performance of CLiP-ICA, demonstrating its effectiveness in controlled settings. Finally, we apply the method to a real-world dataset, utilizing sMRI and fMRI data from the ADNI dataset to showcase its utility in extracting meaningful brain networks."}, {"title": "A. Copula Linked Parallel ICA for multimodal data", "content": "The primary goal of this method is to fuse different modalities, which can have different temporal dimensions, by identifying two unmixing matrices that maximize the likelihood of a 2D joint distribution. This distribution is formed by combining the 1D marginal distribution of each imaging modality with a copula that establishes a connection between them (Sklar, 1959). The marginal distribution can vary across different imaging modalities, and the copula can take various forms, such as a Gaussian copula or a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula (Ma et al., 2007; Sklar, 1959). In this study, we implemented the Gaussian copula for its simplicity and its ease of extension to high dimensions, which enhances computational speed by eliminating the need to loop through each pair. The Gaussian copula is particularly advantageous because it can effectively capture the dependency structure between the marginal distributions without being overly complex, thus making it computationally efficient for large datasets and more easily interpreted.\nWe selected the logistic distribution as the marginal distribution based on previous ICA studies in brain imaging, as it has shown robust and replicable results across different imaging modalities and is a good match to the underlying source distributions (Agcaoglu et al., 2016; Agcaoglu et al., 2024; Allen et al., 2018; Calhoun, & Adali, 2012; Cetin et al., 2016; Esposito et al., 2002; Lange et al., 1999; McKeown et al., 2003; McKeown et al., 1998; Rashid et al., 2019). The logistic distribution is known for its heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, which can provide a better fit for the data characteristics typically observed in neuroimaging. This selection helps in capturing the intrinsic variability and dependencies within the brain imaging data more accurately.\nBy integrating the Gaussian copula with logistic marginals, our method not only leverages the theoretical strengths of copula-based models but also ensures practical applicability and reliability in neuroimaging contexts. This dual advantage makes our approach a powerful tool for uncovering the complex interdependencies in brain imaging data, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of brain function and structure. Our methods can also be extended to other types of data beyond neuroimaging, where the relationship between different perspectives or variables can be modeled using copulas. The flexibility of the copula framework allows for various extensions and adaptations, making it a versatile choice for multivariate data analysis in different scientific fields\nThe CLiP-ICA method begins by applying principal component analysis (PCA) separately to each modality, thereby reducing the dimensionality to the final model order. Subsequently, the method estimates optimized unmixing matrices. During the estimation phase, the batches contain data from corresponding voxels in both sMRI and fMRI modalities. To facilitate this correspondences, we adjusted the resolution of the sMRI images to match that of the fMRI images post-PCA. During the initial epochs of the estimation, we compute the cross-correlation between the sMRI and fMRI components. The columns of the weight matrices are permuted to align the best matching components. Such alignment is vital, especially in higher-order models, where the incentive for independence can overshadow the reward for copula correlation. Additionally, to account for the sign ambiguity, the corresponding column and row is multiplied by -1 where necessary to ensure positive spatial correlation between modality pairs. This helps the model to converge to the global rather than a local minimum during estimation..\nDetailed steps for CLIP-ICA:\n1. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Each modality (sMRI and fMRI) undergoes PCA independently, reducing the dimensionality to the desired model order. This step simplifies the data while preserving essential features.\n2. Resolution Matching: The sMRI image resolution is adjusted to match the fMRI image resolution after PCA. This ensures that data from both modalities are comparable and can be integrated effectively.\n3. Estimation and Optimization: The estimation process involves iterating through batches containing data from corresponding voxels from both sMRI and fMRI. The goal is to find the optimized unmixing matrices that maximize the joint likelihood.\n4. Component Alignment: During the initial estimation epochs, we calculate the cross-correlation between the sMRI and fMRI components. Then we permute the columns of the weight matrices to match the best corresponding components. Aligning the components is a critical step, particularly in higher-order models. It ensures that the incentive for independence in the components does not surpass the reward for maintaining the copula correlation. Proper alignment prevents the model from settling into a local minimum, guiding it towards the global minimum during estimation. As mentioned earlier, the columns are also multiplied with -1 where they have negative correlation to ensure positive correlation between pairs, because in gaussian copula negative and positive correlation has the same loss.\n5. Evaluation: The alignment and optimization steps are continuously evaluated to ensure that the model is converging correctly. This involves monitoring the loss function and making necessary adjustments to the estimation process.\nThe combination of these steps ensures that the CLiP-ICA method effectively integrates information from both sMRI and fMRI modalities, leveraging the strengths of each to achieve a robust and accurate model. A block diagram illustrating the CLiP-ICA method is presented in Figure 1, and the derivation of the loss function is detailed below.\nThe derivation of the loss function of the CLIP-ICA can be described as follows. Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the dimension-reduced data of modality 1 and 2, each with a size of $c \\times v$, and let $X$ be the concatenated data of size $2c \\times v$. Similarly, let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be the sources of each modality, and $Y$ be the concatenation of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ with a size of $2c \\times v$. Let $W_1$ and $W_2$ be the $c\\times c$ mixing matrices of each modality, respectively; such that $Y_1 = W_1 X_1$ and $Y_2 = W_2\\cdot X_2$ through matrix multiplication, which can be written as:.\n$$Y = \\begin{bmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} W_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & W_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\end{bmatrix} so\\ that,\\ Y=W\\cdot X.$$\nFor simplicity, let $x_1$, $x_2$, $x$, $y_1$, $y_2$ and $y$ be column vectors representing samples taken from the corresponding data columns. Applying the probability transformation formula, the probability of observing $x$ for a given $W$ can be written as:\n$$p_X(x) = p_Y(y) \\cdot |det\\ W| = p_Y(y) \\cdot |det(W_1 \\cdot W_2)|,$$\nwhere $p_X(x)$ and $p_Y(y)$ are probability distribution functions. Applying the assumption that sources are independent within each modality, this can be written as:\n$$p_X(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^C p_Y(y_i, y_{i+c}) |det\\ W|.$$\nUtilizing Sklar's theorem (Sklar, 1959), the expression can be written using a copula $c_u$ as:\n$$p_X(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^C p_Y(y_i) p_Y (y_{i+c}) \\cdot c_u(u_i, u_{i+c})|det\\ W|.$$\nFor the Gaussian copula:\n$$C_\\mathcal{R}_i^{Gcop} (u_i, u_{i+c}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{det\\ \\mathcal{R}_i}} exp \\bigg(-\\frac{1}{2} [\\Phi^{-1}(u_i)\\ \\Phi^{-1} (u_{i+c})]  \\mathcal{R}_i^{-1}   \\begin{bmatrix} \\Phi^{-1}(u_i) \\\\ \\Phi^{-1}(u_{i+c}) \\end{bmatrix}  \\bigg),$$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix, and $\\mathcal{R}_i$ is the correlation matrix where $\\sigma_{i,i+c}$ describing the dependencies between $y_i$ and $y_{i+c}$. The variable $u_i$ refers to a variable taken from the uniform distribution after passing the sources to their cumulative distribution function (cdf), $F_y (y)$ and $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse cdf of 1D Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance\n$$\\mathcal{R}_i = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\sigma_{i,i+c} \\\\ [\\sigma_{i,i+c} & 1 \\end{bmatrix} where\\ |\\sigma_{i,i+c}| \\leq 1 \\ and \\ u_i = F_{y_i}(y_i).$$\nThen the loss function can easily be optimized by minimizing negative log-likelihood, -log($p_X(x)$). The same equation can also be expressed in vector form with an $R$ matrix of size $2c \\times 2c$, all diagonal elements are 1, indices of $(i, i + c)$ and $(i + c, i)$ are set to dependencies, and all others are set to 0. The optimization process for the CLiP-ICA's loss function was executed in Python using the PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2019), with the Adam optimizer (Kingma et al., 2015)."}, {"title": "B. Simulation", "content": "We first tested the performance of the CLiP-ICA in a controlled environment, using a simple simulation. To do so, we generated four spatially independent components using the simulation toolbox (simTB) (Erhardt et al., 2012) (http://trendscenter.org/software). Subsequently, employing custom MATLAB scripts, we generated a second set of four components linked to the first set with Pearson correlations of 0.94, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.02. Importantly, we maintained independence between the components and preserved the blob-like structure in each component. Each component was designed with a logistic distribution with a zero mean and a scale parameter of 1. Following this, we created a mixing matrix of size 300 by 4 and generated the observed fMRI data, corresponding to 10 subjects, each with 30 volumes. Next, we generated another mixing matrix of size 10 by 4 and obtained the observed sMRI data, corresponding to 10 subjects. Finally, we attempted to recover the sources using the CLiP-ICA method. Initially, we applied two separate PCA steps to reduce the dimension to four, then z-scored the principle components. Then applied CLiP-ICA, with the Gaussian copula and dependency parameter set to 0.90 for all four components."}, {"title": "C. Real Data from ADNI sMRI and fMRI", "content": "We tested our new method using fMRI and sMRI data from the ADNI dataset (Jack et al., 2008). Both modality datasets were already preprocessed in a previous study (Abrol et al., 2020). The fMRI data was preprocessed through a standard preprocessing pipeline including motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing (Abrol et al., 2020). We run the sMRI data through a unified segmentation pipeline, resulting in gray matter (GM) probability density maps; the T1 images were then warped to MNI space, modulated to preserve volume changes, and smoothed using a 3D Gaussian kernel to 6 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM)(Abrol et al., 2020). Our dataset included a total of 864 people. Out of these, 83 were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 384 had normal cognitive abilities (CN), 105 showed early signs of mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), 188 were identified with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 57 participants were in the late stage of mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 47 participants had significant memory concerns (SMC).\nWe applied our method to the ADNI dataset. For our analysis, we selected an ICA model with an order of 75 components, which has been shown to capture modular FNC (Agcaoglu et al., 2015; Allen et al., 2011). To eliminate the non-brain regions, we generated a common mask for the fMRI and sMRI data. The fMRI images were masked and demeaned so that each volume has zero mean. The fMRI images were underwent a two-step PCA process: first, a subject-specific PCA reduced the dimensions to 100, and then principle components were z-scored, followed by a group PCA to further reduce to 75 dimensions.\nThe sMRI images were initially concatenated along the subject dimension and were masked using a group sMRI mask and demeaned. Then PCA was applied to reduce to 75 dimensions. Afterward, the PCA-processed SMRI images were down-sampled to match the spatial resolution of the fMRI images. Then the common mask was used to retain same voxels with fMRI. We used Group ICA Of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT) (https://github.com/trendscenter/gift) for the PCA and AFNI's (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/) 3dresample function to reduce the spatial resolution.\nWe set the Gaussian copula linkage parameters (sMRI/fMRI similarity) to span from 0.95 to 0.5, equally spaced for 75 networks (note that the networks naturally align with these linkages during the optimization step). Along with this, the copula covariance matrix was defined as 150 by 150, outlining the linkage. To ensure stability, we repeated the analysis 10 times, every time starting at random initial points and checking for the repeatability of components using ICASSO framework (Himberg et al., 2004). Then the run that provided the most stable components that are at the centroids of all runs has been selected for further analysis. After generating the aggregated components, we calibrated the components sign based on the skewness of the distribution.\nNext, we performed back-reconstruction on sMRI and fMRI data using the aggregated components with a spatially constrained ICA algorithm called multi-objective optimization ICA with reference (MOO-ICAR) (Du et al., 2013; Du et al., 2020) and generated subjects time-courses and subject-specific spatial maps; and sMRI component loadings. Finally, we selected resting state networks (RSN) for functional data and intrinsic structural networks (ISN) for structural data; using a combination of correlation with previous templates (Agcaoglu, Muetzel, et al., 2022; Agcaoglu et al., 2019; Allen et al., 2011; Du et al., 2020; Iraji et al., 2023), peak location of the components, and frequency spectrum of the component time-courses.\nFollowing back-reconstruction, we calculated FNC matrices for each subject. To do so, subject component time-courses were detrended, band-pass filtered to 0.01-0.15 Hz, and de-spiked. Finally, FNCs were calculated as Pearson correlation coefficients. Components are reordered in each subdomain to increase modularity visually. Finally, we calculated group differences on the FNC and loading parameters, using a two-sample t-test and corrected for multiple comparison using a false discovery rate (FDR, p<0.05)."}, {"title": "III. RESULTS", "content": "In this section, we first present the simulation results, comparing the components extracted by CLiP-ICA to the ground truth components.

We also present the generated FNC matrices, one of the benefits of incorporating the full temporal information in fMRI into the model. We also highlight group differences in the source loadings as well as the FNCs. In addition, we discuss the loading parameters and the structural network covariations (SNC) that reveal the relationships across different modalities. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of cross-modality similarity between the results obtained from CLIP-ICA and those from separate ICA runs, demonstrating the added value of our multimodal fusion approach in uncovering more integrated and biologically meaningful insights."}, {"title": "A. Simulation", "content": "Figure 2 displays the ground truth components that are generated using simTB. The simulation includes 2 modalities with 4 sources. Among these sources, 3 are highly linked (0.94, 0.94, and 0.91), while 1 is unlinked (0.02). The method's dependency values were set to 0.9 to test whether CLiP-ICA could accurately retrace sources when the provided dependency values did not match the ground truth. Figure 3 shows the results: CLiP-ICA successfully retrieved all 4 sources. This simulation demonstrates the method's capability to accurately identify underlying sources across different modalities, highlighting the flexibility of the approach. Notably, even when the set dependency values did not align with the true dependencies, CLiP-ICA successfully separated the components. This was observed when the assigned dependency value (0.9) was either higher or lower than the actual cross-modal similarity (e.g., a cross-correlation of 0.02). This suggests that the method adapts to the data without imposing artificially high correlations when they are not present."}, {"title": "B. Real Data from ADNI sMRI and fMRI", "content": "In the ADNI data, we first analyzed the degree of linkage between the aggregated components of sMRI and fMRI by calculating the spatial cross-correlation using Pearson correlation. The resulting values are displayed in Figure 4 as well as the assigned copula dependency values. For comparison, we also performed two separate group ICA analyses on the fMRI and sMRI datasets with the same model order of 75. Post-hoc, we matched these components based on their spatial similarity, using Pearson correlation, and sorted them from highest to lowest correlation. These cross-correlation values are also displayed in Figure 4. The correlation values obtained from CLiP-ICA fell between the assigned copula dependency values and the cross-correlation values from the separate ICA runs. This demonstrates the influence of our proposed method on component estimation and highlights its ability to effectively link modalities.\nWe also assessed the stability of the estimated CLiP-ICA using the ICASSO framework (Himberg et al., 2004), and overall, the stability and reproducibility of the components were found to be sufficient. Please refer to the Supplementary Material for the ICASSO results and, also for the results of the estimated components by running two separate group ICA analyses."}, {"title": "C. Functional Network Connectivity and sMRI loading", "content": "Average group FNCs are presented in Figure 6. The analysis of FNC matrices reveals several notable patterns and differences across groups. The average FNC map demonstrates a highly modular structure, showing strong intra-network connectivity, particularly within the SM and VI networks. This modularity is consistent with previous studies (Agcaoglu et al., 2018; Agcaoglu et al., 2019; Agcaoglu et al., 2020; Allen et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2011; Cetin et al., 2016; Damaraju et al., 2014; Du et al., 2020; Rashid et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2019; Rashid et al., 2014; Sakoglu et al., 2010), further supporting the validity of the generated components. A strong negative connectivity pattern is observed between the DM and other networks such as SM and VI, providing further information regarding the brain's functional organization.\nWe also tested group differences in FNC using two-sample t-test, we carried out t-test between CN and other sub-symptoms group, and corrected for multiple comparison using the false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. These results are presented in Figure 7 with symptom severity decreasing order; CN vs AD, LMCI, MCI, EMCI, SMC, and also all MCIs combined. In general, CN subjects exhibit higher connectivity, especially in SM and VI areas, compared to symptomatic groups. As the severity of symptoms decreases, the differences in connectivity also diminish, suggesting a gradient of functional decline. However, there are some exceptions to these, SM networks shows an increased in connectivity within the MCI group. Moreover, connectivity differences between SC #19 (uncus) and SM, and SM #1 (medial frontal gyrus) and other SM components also diminishes in MCI, but reappears in the AD stage. This could indicate a non-linear trajectory of connectivity changes, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms or heterogeneity in disease progression within the MCI stage. MCI has higher FNC in all intra-SM networks, though only few of the network pairs show FDR significant differences.\nFurther analyses comparing individuals at varying stages of cognitive decline with cognitively normal individuals reveal significant connectivity differences between MCI and AD; in the SM network, as well as between SM and subcortical (SC), visual (VI), and cerebellar (CC) regions. In general the pattern was similar for across all comparisons with controls. AD also appears to be more similar to the other cognitive decline groups. Results are presented in Figure 8. These findings highlight the complex and differential impact of AD on these networks across subgroups, suggesting that the progression of the disease may uniquely affect these specific areas depending on the stage and severity of cognitive decline. As an example of the complementary information contained in the different modalities, the loadings of SM #1 show no significant group differences in the loadings between any of the other cognitive groups. However, FNC of SM #1 with other SM networks showed a prominent pattern of significant group differences between CN vs EMCI, which disappears in MCI and LMCI, and reappears in AD. SM #1 is the most strongly linked component between SMRI and fMRI modalities. This suggest that while the structural integrity of SM #1 may not be impacted significantly by cognitive decline, its connectivity significantly changes with other SM networks (which do show changes in SMRI loadings). Moreover, SM #23 and SM #24 show a significant increase in loading in AD, compared to CNs. SM #23 is located adjacent and anterior to SM#1. This illustrates the benefits of using the multimodal approach and complementary information provided by sMRI and fMRI.\nsMRI loading differences between CN individuals and those with varying degrees of cognitive impairment are displayed in Figure 9. Significant differences in sMRI loadings are observed across most subgroups, except for the SMC group. CN subjects generally show higher sMRI loadings, which reflect greater preservation of brain structure and lower levels of atrophy compared to other groups. This suggests that CN individuals maintain more structural integrity in brain regions affected by cognitive decline. In contrast, subjects in subgroups such as AD, LMCI, MCI, and EMCI display lower sMRI loadings, indicating reduced structural integrity in specific brain regions."}, {"title": "IV. DISCUSSION", "content": "In this paper, we proposed a novel method for multimodal fusion and provided applications on both simulation and real dataset to illustrate its capabilities for coupling structural and functional neuroimaging data. The proposed CLIP-ICA offers several advantages in the fusion of sMRI and fMRI imaging data. Unlike traditional fusion methods, which often reduce 4D fMRI data to 3D features, CLiP-ICA fully integrates the rich temporal dynamics of fMRI, preserving critical information about time-varying brain activity. By utilizing a copula-based approach, CLiP-ICA flexibly links spatial components from different modalities, capturing both shared and unique aspects of brain networks.\nThe findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CLiP-ICA in coupling structural and functional MRI data, providing insights into the complex interactions between brain structure and function across different stages of AD. Our approach was able to uncover both linked and modality-unique components, offering a rich understanding of the links between brain structure and brain network dynamics which are not accessible in traditional, separately applied, ICA methods. Previous studies (Kotoski et al., 2024; Luo, Sui, Abrol, Chen, et al., 2020; Luo, Sui, Abrol, Lin, et al., 2020; Segall et al., 2012) reported the intrinsic networks in resting fMRI, also observed in sMRI data. Our approach enables the simultaneous estimation of these networks, allowing for a more effective analysis while preserving the temporally rich data from 4D fMRI. In contrast, other methods often reduce 4D fMRI data to 3D features, failing to fully leverage the complete temporal information during data fusion, especially in cases of mismatched dimensionality\nCLIP-ICA identified a higher number of meaningful components in both the functional and structural domains, even with a relatively low model order. The ability to couple structural and functional information during network estimation proved advantageous, offering benefits in addressing the long-standing challenge of determining the optimal model order for such analyses. While CLiP-ICA retained a high number of RSNs and ISNs, it also effectively distinguished between modality-unique sources, capturing in the components above 59 with low sMRI/fMRI coupling. This ability to capture both shared and distinct neural characteristics underscores the flexibility of our approach in handling complex multimodal data.\nCLIP-ICA also proved capable of accurately retrieving both highly linked and unlinked components, even when the assigned dependency values did not perfectly match the true cross-modality relationships. This adaptability highlights the robustness of the method, ensuring that it captures the intrinsic patterns of the data rather than imposing artificially high correlations. This is particularly important in studies of complex brain conditions like AD, where the nature of structural and functional coupling may vary substantially across different stages of the disease.\nFurthermore, our analysis of FNC revealed a highly modular structure in the SM and VI networks, with notable negative connectivity between the DM network and these regions. Such modularity has been reported in previous studies (Agcaoglu et al., 2018; Agcaoglu et al., 2019; Allen et al., 2011; Espinoza et al., 2019; L\u00f3pez-Vicente et al., 2021; Rashid et al., 2018; Rashid et al., 2019; Sakoglu et al., 2010), further validating the robustness of the CLiP-ICA approach. The observed connectivity differences between CN and symptomatic groups suggest that functional decline follows a gradient, with connectivity reductions becoming more pronounced as the severity of cognitive impairment increases. Interestingly, the MCI group demonstrated a transient increase in connectivity within the SM network, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms or variability in disease progression at this stage. Notably, our findings suggest that the progression of AD involves a non-linear pattern of connectivity changes. For example, while connectivity differences between SM and SC networks were reduced in the MCI stage, they reappeared in advanced stages of AD, pointing to a possible heterogeneous trajectory of neurodegeneration or adaptive processes that alter the course of the disease.\nOverall, this study illustrates the potential of CLiP-ICA as a powerful tool for multimodal fusion in neuroimaging research. By integrating structural and functional MRI data, the method enables a more comprehensive analysis of the intricate changes that occur during the progression of AD. Future studies could build on these findings by applying CLiP-ICA to larger, more diverse datasets, and by exploring its application in longitudinal studies to better track the dynamics of brain changes and assess the impact of therapeutic interventions over time.\nSome limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, the dataset used includes unbalanced group sizes, with a higher number of CN subjects compared to those in other dementia subgroups. This imbalance could potentially bias the results, as differences between groups may be influenced by the disproportionate sample sizes. Future studies should aim to include a more balanced representation of each clinical group to ensure more robust comparisons. Additionally, we used a Gaussian copula to link the components, which assumes uniform contribution across the entire distribution for a given source-pairs. However, brain networks are"}]}

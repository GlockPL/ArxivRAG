Our review of the literature identified two broad themes representing the purpose of the interaction between these two areas: argumentation for machine learning and machine learning for argumentation. Across these two themes, we systematically evaluate the spectrum of works across various dimensions, including the type of learning and the form of argumentation framework used. Further, we identify three types of interaction between these two areas: synergistic approaches, where the Argumentation and Machine Learning components are tightly integrated; segmented approaches, where the two are interleaved such that the outputs of one are the inputs of the other; and approximated approaches, where one component shadows the other at a chosen level of detail. We draw conclusions about the suitability of certain forms of Argumentation for supporting certain types of Machine Learning, and vice versa, with clear patterns emerging from the review. Whilst the reviewed works provide inspiration for successfully combining the two fields of research, we also identify and discuss limitations and challenges that ought to be addressed in order to ensure that they remain a fruitful pairing as AI advances.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In this chapter, we overview research works that combine Computational Argumentation (henceforth simply argumentation) and Machine Learning (ML). In this section, we start with a general outlook of the themes and trends prevalent among the individual works overviewed in the chapter, including a loose categorisation of three types of interactions between ML an argumentation models, before briefly covering related work and papers we chose to omit. We then move on to our literature overview in \u00a72 which we split by broad themes of the purposes of the interactions between ML and argumentation, briefly discussing promising research avenues. Finally, we conclude in \u00a73.\nWe assume the reader to be familiar with forms and frameworks of argumentation, e.g. as discussed in the 1st Volume of the Handbook of Formal Argumentation (Baroni et al., 2018), and fundamentals of and common methods in ML, as easily accessible e.g. on Wikipedia."}, {"title": "1.1 Outlook", "content": "Studies that consider interactions of argumentation and ML exhibit the following trends. Starting with ML characteristics, the type of learning employed is largely supervised, though there are instances of works that consider unsupervised as well as both un/supervised types of learning, and a reasonable amount of works that focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In terms of ML models and algorithms employed, it is typical, but not exclusively so, to make use of simpler techniques and architectures, such as rule learning (including both rule induction and rule extraction), tree-based models (such as decision trees (DTs) and random forests (RFs)), naive Bayesian classifiers (NBCs), support vector machines (SVMs), (usually shallow and/or feed-forward) neural networks (NNs) and model-based RL.

Here, the general trend is for methods to target the improvement of the ML model's performance, explain its outputs or a combination of the two. We begin with those which concern improvement alone, before transitioning to those which concern explanation alone roughly according to the works' main objectives. The works whose main objective is judged to be improvement in performance are discussed in \u00a72.1.1 and summarised in Table 1, while those where the main objective is enhanced explainability are discussed in \u00a72.1.2 and summarised in Table 2."}, {"title": "2.1.3 Discussion", "content": "Our review so far of the works where argumentation has been used for supplementing ML models allows us to make the first following conclusions.\nArgumentative methods for improving ML-based inference show promise for small models and datasets, but it remains to be seen whether this can be replicated at scale. Argumentation has been proposed to improve ML-based inference, under the assumption that argumentation-based inference is better-suited to reasoning with rules of thumb and exceptions than ML-based pattern matching is, or that it can readily incorporate expert knowledge. This is perhaps borne out in settings of small models and datasets, where patterns or rules discovered by ML can be augmented with, say, rule-based, argumentative reasoning. Whether argumentation can be similarly helpful with modern large scale models and datasets remains to be seen, especially because modern ML inference resolves conflicts probabilistically (the more likely patterns yield preferred inference) and large scale datasets tend to allow for capturing exceptions and particular contexts using larger models. We hope though that argumentation (or similar symbolic reasoning methods, for that matter) could"}, {"title": "2.2 ML for Argumentation", "content": "In this subsection, we first discuss some proposals for using argumentation frameworks for representing patterns learnt from data and making inferences thereon, essentially as a paradigm of argumentation-based learning to replace standard methods of supervised learning. We then overview several works that instead use ML to improve argumentation, by either supporting learning of argumentation frameworks from data or suggesting to learn and predict argument acceptance statuses in argumentation frameworks. Next, we cover works which combine ML and argumentation for analysis of the two formalisms, with some overlap with the sections covered in \u00a72.1. We lastly cover a couple of works that focus on human dialogues in the real world and suggest that ML is perhaps more useful there than argumentation, implying that ML could be used in place of argumentation for some specific tasks."}, {"title": "2.2.1 For Supporting Argumentation", "content": null}, {"title": "2.2.3 Discussion", "content": "The use of inductive ML to generate argumentation frameworks shows much promise, but is still to be proven with real datasets. The two approaches for generating SA frameworks from tabular data using inductive ML give novel approaches to automated reasoning which could serve as the basis for fruitful directions of future research, given their interesting theoretical results. If the next steps of proving that this theory translates to real-world datasets at scale are made, this could provide a significant advancement for neuro-symbolic systems. In the case of learning arguments and relationships from text, there seem to be more issues, e.g. due to the need to engineer features and the free-form nature of textual data. However, in settings where the semantics of potential arguments drawn from text are relatively constrained, e.g. in review aggregation in a specified domain, there seems to be the possibility of fully automating these pipelines. This must be undertaken with caution, however, as in some domains it has been shown that ML can effectively replace argumentative systems.\nGNNs' natural fit for approximating argument evaluation has much potential, capitalising on existing AF datasets and generators.

We have broadly categorised these works into those which can be classed as argumentation for ML, and those which are ML for argumentation. The two overarching objectives in the former set of works are either improving or explaining ML models' inference, though the two are not mutually exclusive and most of the works tackle the two in tandem. The second set of works are less homogeneous, with objectives ranging from using ML to generate argumentation frameworks, to approximating semantics or recommending arguments to users without the need for an argumentation semantics. We have shown that this integration of symbolic and data-driven approaches remains a highly active yet open-ended area of research, with great potential along numerous avenues. However, challenges still remain for ar-"}]}

Our results show that established methods such as ion exchange perform comparably well in generating stable materials, although many of these materials tend to closely resemble known compounds. In contrast, generative models excel at proposing novel structural frameworks and, when sufficient training data is available, can more effectively target properties such as electronic band gap and bulk modulus while maintaining a high stability rate. To enhance the performance of both the baseline and generative approaches, we implement a post-generation screening step in which all proposed structures are passed through stability and property filters from pre-trained machine learning models including universal interatomic potentials.

Between the two baseline methods, random enumeration yields a much higher novelty rate (98.4%) than ion exchange (70.5%). This reflects the unconstrained nature of random enumeration, which leads to the sampling of many previously unexplored chemical compositions. In contrast, our approach to ion exchange closely reflects traditional screening efforts,47 and is therefore more likely to reproduce materials already present in computational databases such as MP.

This success likely stems from FTCP's ability to sample from a latent space informed by known compounds with the band gaps close to the target, enabling the generation of materials with structural or compositional similarities to the reference points. Importantly, this is accomplished while retaining a large proportion of stable materials: 22.4% of those generated by FTCP exhibit $\\Delta E_d \\leq 0$, and many more lie reasonably close to the convex hull (Supplementary Figure 4). This result suggests that generative models can excel in targeted property generation, outperforming the baseline methods, while maintaining relatively high stability rates.\n\nUsing the same four methods described above (for targeting a desired band gap), we next generated materials with the objective of maximizing bulk modulus. This task fundamentally differs from the previous band gap-related objective by focusing on materials with extreme properties (e.g., maximal bulk modulus) instead of those within an intermediate range (e.g., band gaps near 3 eV).

This smaller shift in the distribution likely reflects the tendency for ion exchange to introduce only minor compositional changes, which limits its ability to substantially alter the mechanical properties of the original materials \u2013 many of which (in MP) do not exhibit anomalously high bulk moduli. FTCP performed better than ion exchange but worse than ML filtering of randomly enumerated materials, with 13.4% of the compounds generated by FTCP exhibiting a bulk modulus \u2265 300 GPa. Compared to its strong performance on electronic band gap, we suspect FTCP is less effective here given the scarcity of materials with extremely high bulk moduli in MP. This lack of training data may limit the conditioning of the autoencoder's latent space on extreme bulk modulus values. Nevertheless, FTCP still has an advantage in generating stable materials while maximizing bulk modulus. In comparison to filtering of randomly enumerated materials using CGCNN, where only 0.8% of the resulting compounds are stable ($\\Delta E_d \\leq 0$), FTCP maintains a much higher stability rate of 17.1% during this targeted property generation (Supplementary Figure 5).

Doing so leads to a near three-fold increase in the success rate of identifying materials with desired properties compared to random enumeration but remains relatively low (16.9%) when targeting extreme property values (e.g., a bulk modulus > 300 GPa). It also leads to a decrease in the stability rate of the proposed materials, though incorporating a uMLIP-based stability filter could mitigate this issue.

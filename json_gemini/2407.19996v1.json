This study aims to reproduce the results presented in \u201cITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation\" by Zhang et al. (2023a), which introduces a model to improve inclusiveness in these kinds of models. We show that most of the claims made by the authors about ITI-GEN hold: it improves the diversity and quality of generated images, it is scalable to different domains, it has plug-and-play capabilities, and it is efficient from a computational point of view. However, ITI-GEN sometimes uses undesired attributes as proxy features and it is unable to disentangle some pairs of (correlated) attributes such as gender and baldness. In addition, when the number of considered attributes increases, the training time grows exponentially and ITI-GEN struggles to generate inclusive images for all elements in the joint distribution. To solve these issues, we propose using Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting, a method that does not require training and that handles negation better than vanilla Hard Prompt Search. Nonetheless, Hard Prompt Search (with or without negative prompting) cannot be used for continuous attributes that are hard to express in natural language, an area where ITI-GEN excels as it is guided by images during training. Finally, we propose combining ITI-GEN and Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Generative AI models that solve text-to-image tasks pose a series of societal risks related to fairness. Some of them come from training data biases, where certain categories are unevenly distributed. As a consequence, the model may ignore some of these categories when it generates images, which leads to societal biases on minority groups.\nIn order to tackle this issue, Zhang et al. (2023a) introduce Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation (ITI-GEN), a method that generates inclusive tokens that can be appended to the text prompts. By concatenating these fair tokens to the text prompts, they are able to generate diverse images with respect to a predefined set of attributes (e.g. gender, race, age). For example, we can add a \u201cwoman\u201d token to the text prompt \u201ca headshot of a person\" to ensure that the person in the generated image is a woman.\nIn this work, we aim to focus on:"}, {"title": "Scope of reproducibility", "content": "In the original paper, the authors make the following main claims:\n1) Inclusive and high-quality generation. ITI-GEN improves inclusiveness while preserving image quality using a small number of reference images during training.

ITI-GEN can learn inclusive prompts in different scenarios such as human faces and landscapes.\n3) Plug-and-play capabilities. Trained fair tokens can be used with other similar text prompts in a plug-and-play manner. Also, the tokens can be used in other text-to-image generative models such as ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b).\n4) Data and computational efficiency. Only a few dozen images per category are required, and training and inference last only a couple of minutes.\n5) Scalability to multiple attributes. ITI-GEN obtains great results when used with different attributes at the same time.\nIn this work, we run experiments to check the authors' statements above.

Finally, since the authors did not provide any code for integrating ITI-GEN with ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b), we implement it ourselves to check the compatibility of ITI-GEN with other generative models. All of these are better detailed in Section 3.4."}, {"title": "Model description", "content": "ITI-GEN is a method that improves inclusiveness in text-to-image generation. It outputs a set of fair tokens that are appended to a text prompt in order to guide the model to generate images in a certain way. It achieves this by using reference images for each attribute category. For example, if we use the prompt \"a headshot of a person\" and provide images of men and women, the model will learn two tokens, one for each gender.\nGiven a set of M attributes where each attribute m has Km different attribute categories, ITI-GEN learns a set of fair tokens that represent each attribute category. For each combination, the corresponding fair tokens are aggregated and concatenated to the original text prompt T to build a inclusive prompt P. We denote the set of all inclusive prompts with P, and the set of all inclusive prompts that correspond to category i of attribute m with Pm.\nThe training procedure involves two losses. The first one is the directional alignment loss, which relates the provided reference images to the inclusive prompts. In order to compare images and text, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) is used to map them to a common embedding space using its text encoder Etext and image encoder Eimg. Following the original code, the ViT-L/14 pre-trained model is used. The directional alignment loss is defined by\n$\\Ldir = \\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\sum_{1<i<j<Km} 1 - (\\Delta A_m(i, j), A_m(i, j)),$\nwhere $A_m(i, j)$ is the difference of the average of image embeddings between categories i and j of attribute m, and $A_m(i, j)$ is the difference between the average of embeddings of inclusive prompts correspondent to those categories.\nThis loss is replaced by a cosine similarity loss Lcos when it is undefined (i.e. when the batches are not diverse enough and do not contain samples for every attribute category). Given an image of a certain attribute category, we want to make it similar to all inclusive prompts that contain that attribute category.\nThe second loss is the semantic consistency loss, which acts as a regularizer by making the original text prompts similar to the inclusive prompts:\n$Lsem = \\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\sum_{1<i<j<Km} max(0,-(\\lambda (Etext (P), Etext (T)))),$\nwhere T is the raw text prompt and P the inclusive text prompt for an attribute category combination including category i or j for attribute m and A is a hyperparameter.\nIn this way, the total loss for a batch is defined by:\nLtotal = {$\\Ldir + Lsem$ if Ldir is defined,$\\Lcos + Lsem$ otherwise."}, {"title": "Datasets", "content": "The authors provide four datasets\u00b2 of reference images to train the model:\nCelebA (Liu et al., 2015), a manually-labeled face dataset with 40 binary attributes.

Considering there are 40 binary attributes, that makes a total of 40 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 104 = 8,320 images.\nFor every attribute we have 104 \u00d7 2 = 208 images that are classified using CLIP. Since this classification is not very reliable, we also label the images of selected attributes manually. After that, we compute the KL divergence. In Table 1 we see how HPS struggles with attributes that require negation (e.g., \"a headshot of a person with no eyeglasses\u201d), while ITI-GEN performs well.\nSince the FID score reported in the paper uses around 5,000 images, and we have 8,320, we decide to compute the FID score using the last 63 images of every category, which results in a total of 5,040 images. The results are in Table 2, where we can see that ITI-GEN obtains the best score.\nWe also carry out human evaluations to compare the quality of the images generated by HPS and HPSn with ITI-GEN's. The results show that, in 52.24% of the cases, humans prefer images generated with HPS over ITI-GEN. The same thing happens with HPSn in 56.58% of the cases. This shows a discrepancy with the interpretation of the FID scores, where ITI-GEN shows slightly better quality than the HPS methods. A possible explanation is that the reference datasets for the computation of the FID score and for training ITI-GEN (FFHQ and CelebA respectively) might be similar, which would imply a bias towards ITI-GEN."}, {"title": "Scalability to different domains", "content": "Figure 1 shows that it is possible to apply ITI-GEN to multiple domains, as the second claim holds.

For the natural scenes generated with the \"Colorful\" attribute, we compute the FID score by comparing the generated images with the training ones, obtaining 62.987.

We can observe that while the KL divergence is low when we use two attributes, it increases significantly when we keep adding attributes.

This is the case for attributes like \"Bald\", \"Mustache\" and \"Beard\", which seem to use \"Gender\" as proxy. One could argue that this is not important as long as the model is able to generate people with and without the desired attribute. However, it is actually a problem because as we show in Figure 4, some pairs of attributes are strongly coupled and ITI-GEN is not able to generate accurate images for all elements in the joint distribution. HPSn, on the other hand, is able to disentangle the attributes. More examples are shown in Appendix C.\nOur main hypothesis is that the reason for this lies within the reference images. If we inspect them, we see that most of the bald people are men, which may be the reason why the model is using gender as a proxy. To delve into this, we perform an experiment using two variants of the \"Eyeglasses\" dataset (see Table 4), which is diverse and works fine when combined with the \"Gender\" attribute. Then, we test the ability of the model to learn the joint distribution using those reference images.\nFigure 5a illustrates with quantitative and qualitative results how ITI-GEN correctly handles the combination of the \"Gender\" and \"Eyeglasses\" attributes using the original reference dataset. If we alter the diversity of the dataset by entangling both attributes, the model fails to learn the \"Eyeglasses\" attribute and uses \"Gender\" as a proxy feature, as shown in Figure 5b (the generated samples of women with eyeglasses are"}, {"title": "Handling multiple attributes", "content": "Computational complexity. The training loop iterates through all reference images, which implies a linear complexity with respect to the size of the training set. At the same time, it considers all category pairs within an attribute, which means it is quadratic with respect to that. It also iterates through all elements in the joint distribution, so it is exponential with respect to the number of attributes. This can be problematic when we train ITI-GEN on many attributes. For example, in the case of binary attributes with the same number of reference images, the time complexity is O(Ne), as Figure 8 depicts.\nDiversity issues in generated images. Figure 6 illustrates a comparison between ITI-GEN and HPSn. We can observe that ITI-GEN struggles significantly to generate diverse images (the difference between old and young people is almost non-existent, there are many people without eyeglasses, etc.). On the other hand, images generated by HPSn reliably reflect all category combinations.\nThis behaviour can also be observed in our quantitative results. More specifically, we compute the KL divergence using 104 images in every category combination. The numerical results are displayed in Table 3, on which we can observe that ITI-GEN obtains a KL divergence of approximately 0.3560, while HPSn's is almost equal to 0."}, {"title": "Combining ITI-Gen with HPSn", "content": "The main motivations for image-guided prompting are handling negations and continuous attributes that are hard to specify with text. As we have shown, negation can be effectively tackled using HPSn, but ITI-GEN"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "In this work, we conduct several experiments to check the validity of the main claims from the original paper. We find that most of them are correct with some small exceptions.\nFirst, we show ITI-GEN (Zhang et al., 2023a) is able to generate diverse high-quality images, according to the low KL divergence and FID scores we obtained (see Tables 1 and 2). We also highlight that it works on multiple domains, such as human faces and landscapes. Moreover, ITI-GEN has plug-and-play capabilities when learned inclusive tokens are applied to similar text prompts (Figure 2). The fair tokens can also be integrated with different text-to-image generators (i.e. Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022), ControlNet (Zhang et al., 2023b)), as displayed in Figures 1, 2, 3. In addition, we verify that only a few dozen reference images are required, and that training is computationally efficient (Figure 11).\nOn the other hand, we show that the claim about scalability to multiple attributes does not completely hold. More specifically, our analysis reveals that ITI-GEN needs exponential training time with respect to the number of attributes (Figure 8) and struggles to generate diverse images when we increase the number of attributes (Figure 6). Moreover, we illustrate that ITI-GEN can struggle to disentangle certain attributes (e.g. \"Gender\" and \"Bald\" in Figure 4). To solve these issues, we propose HPSn which does not require training and produces more accurate images. At the same time, it seems to handle negations better than ITI-GEN, especially when we use a large number of attributes (Figure 6, Table 1). However, a limitation of HPSn is that it cannot handle attributes that are difficult to specify with text (e.g. skin tone, colorfulness), whereas ITI-GEN excels on these. As we show in Figure 7, ITI-GEN and HPSn can be combined to generate images that are inclusive with respect to multiple attributes, taking advantage of the strong aspects of each method."}, {"title": "What was easy", "content": "The paper was well-written and included many examples to make it easier to understand. Additionally, the original code was published on GitHub, with instructions on how to run the training, generation and evaluation scripts."}, {"title": "What was difficult", "content": "The main difficulty consisted in understanding the code, since there were some differences with the paper. More specifically, when the directional loss is undefined, it is replaced by a cosine similarity loss between the image and text embeddings.\nMoreover, the evaluation script requires a list of classes that is not specified.

Thus, it was not possible for us to easily reproduce the KL divergence results."}, {"title": "Communication with original authors", "content": "We reached out to the authors via email correspondence regarding the quality of the generated images and the missing code for combining ITI-GEN with ControlNet. They replied quickly and cleared up the discrepancies in our results. However, we did not receive from the authors any additional code for integrating ITI-GEN with ControlNet, because they were still working on it. They assured us they would upload the code on their original GitHub repository as soon as possible, so that we can cross-verify our implementations."}, {"title": "Ethical and Social Impact", "content": "As ITI-GEN is guided visually, we need a set of reference images. This raises some concerns regarding inclusiveness and privacy.\nEven though the output images are usually inclusive with respect to the attributes of interest, they might not be with respect to others. This can be problematic, because someone aiming to increase diversity could actually be introducing other biases without realizing it. Thus, it is important to ensure that the reference images are not biased, and conduct some sort of quality evaluation on the outputs.\nAnother important aspect is data protection. If ITI-GEN is trained on a publicly available dataset, we need to have permission to do so. Inspired by Carlini et al. (2023), we wonder if an attacker could recover the training images using the inclusive tokens, which would be problematic if ITI-GEN was trained on a private dataset.\nAll in all, we agree with the original authors' that carefully considering potential risks of ITI-GEN is essential to avoid possible negative consequences."}]}

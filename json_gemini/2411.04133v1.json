It divides the universe in the beginning and uses equivalency relations to produce blocks. Numerous generalized rough set models have been put out and investigated in an effort to increase flexibility and extend the range of possible uses. We introduce four new generalized rough set models that draw inspiration from \"neighborhoods and primals\" in order to make a contribution to this topic. By minimizing the uncertainty regions, these models are intended to assist decision makers in more effectively analyzing and evaluating the provided data. We verify this goal by demonstrating that the existing models outperform certain current method approaches in terms of improving the approximation operators (upper and lower) and accuracy measurements. We claim that the current models can preserve nearly all significant aspects associated with the rough set model. Preserving the monotonic property, which enables us to assess data uncertainty and boost confidence in outcomes, is one of the intriguing characterizations derived from the existing models. With the aid of specific instances, we also compare the areas of the current approach. Finally, we demonstrate that the new strategy we define for our everyday health-related problem yields more accurate findings.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Pawlak [31, 32] introduced rough set theory, which has been thought of as a tool for conceptualizing and analyzing different types of data. It can be applied to attribute value representation models to determine decision rules, assess the importance of attributes, and characterize the connections between them. As a tool for handling ambiguity and uncertainty in information, the idea has significant implications for cognitive sciences and intelligent decision-making.

Applications", "content": "Using the knowledge framework described above, we apply novel tech- niques presented in Section 3 to reduce the characteristics and identify sig- nificant indicators of breast cancer in females [17] in this segment. Let \u039e be a collection of goals, and let {1,2,3,4,5,6} represent the six patients on the list. The characteristics are V = {A1, A2, A3, A4, A5}, which stand for breast lump, inverted nipple, rashes, discharge from the nipple, and armpit swelling, in that order. Table 2 describes how individuals should consult a physician when they experience one or more breast cancer symptoms. Based on Table 1, we can infer each patient's symptoms as follows:\nV(1) = V(2)= {A1, A2, A3, A4}, V(3) = V(5)= {A2, A4, A5}, V(4) = {A1, A3, A5}, and V(6) = {A1, A2, A4, A5}.\nThus, the relation that represents this system can be given by: m\u03a9n \u21d4 V(m) \u2286 V(n), for each x, y \u2208 \u039e. Then \u03a9 = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6)}.\nFinally, we consider the primal is P = {(\u00d8), {3}, {5}, {6}, {3,5}}.\nConsequently, our techniques can be considered powerful tools for making decisions in the rough set theory and can benefit from the identification and extraction of concealed details in data collected through practical ap- plications. Our techniques are the most effective means of evaluating the accuracy and ambiguities of the sets. As an illustration, we look at the sub- sets K ={1,2,6} and L = {3,4,5}, which stand for the set of infected brain cancer and uninfected brain cancer, respectively. Next, the approximations of them obtained from the current approaches in this study (Definition 3.3 ) and the Allam's methods in (Definition 2.3 ) are provided as follows, re- spectively:\nAllam's method [4, 5] The approximations for infected set Kare:\n$N_a(K)$= {1,2,6}\n$N_a(K)$= {1,2, 3, 5, 6}\nThus $\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1 (\u039a) =$.\nAccordingly K is rough (not definable) set defined by Allam's method.\nIn a comparable way, the estimates for the uninfected set L are:\n$N_a(L)$= {4}\n$N_a(L)$= {3,4,5,6}\nThus $\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1 (L) =$\nAccordingly L is rough (not definable) set.\nOur's methods The approximations for infected set K are:\n$N37 (K)$={1, 2, 3, 5, 6}\n$N3 (K)={1,2}\nThus $\u03c3\\frac{-P}{N3j} (K) =1$.\nAs a result, K is precisely defined by our methods."}]}

Yet, we encountered some pathological problems (time shift, amplification, static solutions) and proposed novel methods to resolve them.\n\nAmong these novel methods are the PDE forms, which evolve from the lower-level form with fewer unknown dependent variables (e.g., displacements, slope, finite extension) to higher-level form with more dependent variables (e.g., forces, moments, momenta, etc.), in addition to those from lower-level forms. Traditionally, the highest-level form, the balance-of-momenta form, is the starting point for (hand) deriving the lowest-level form through a tedious (and error prone) process of successive substitutions. The next step in a finite element method is to discretize the lowest-level form upon forming a weak form and linearization with appropriate interpolation functions, followed by their implementation in a code and testing. The time-consuming tedium in all of these steps could be bypassed by applying the proposed novel PINN directly to the highest-level form.\n\nWe also developed a script based on JAX, the High Performance Array Computing. For the axial motion of elastic bar, while our JAX script did not show the pathological problems of DDE-T (DDE with TensorFlow backend), it is slower than DDE-T. Moreover, that DDE-T itself being more efficient in higher-level form than in lower-level form makes working directly with higher-level form even more attractive in addition to the advantages mentioned further above.\n\nSince coming up with an appropriate learning-rate schedule for a good solution is more art than science, we systematically codified in detail our experience running optimization through a normalization/standardization of the network-training process so readers can reproduce our results. As the training speed is most likely related to the gradient computation, we provide snippets of our DDE-T script and our JAX script with detailed annotation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "As a prototype of partial-differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs) for novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) formulations, the geometrically-exact rod with no shear is considered here, starting with the assumption often attributed to Kirchhoff (or Kirchhoff-Clebsch, or Kirchhoff-Love, or Kirchhoff-Clebsch-Love; see the review in [3] [4] and the references therein): Plane cross section initially perpendicular to the undeformed centroidal line remains perpendicular to the deformed centroidal line.\n\nOur formulation's starting point is similar to that in [4], then takes on a different direction as we are aiming at developing a finite deformable rod, without introducing approximations, culminating in a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, complemented by algebraic expressions with derivatives (AEDs), i.e., a PDAE system of the form\n\n$D^{(k)}({\u2202xuj,\u2202x\u22121uj,\u2026,\u2202Dxuj},{\u2202tuj,\u2202t\u22121uj,\u2026,\u2202tQuj},uj,t)=0,u(x,t):={\u2202xuj,\u2202\u22121uj,\u2026,\u2202Dxuj},{\u2202tuj,\u2202t\u22121uj,\u2026,\u2202tQuj},Uj$(82)\n\nwhere $D^{(k)}$ is a nonlinear differential operator, operating on $u(x, t)$, which collects the unknown dependent variables $\\{u_j\\}$ and their partial derivatives, with $\\{k, i, j, p, q\\}$ being indices to be defined later in the paper.\n\nAn example of a PDAE system is the motion of the Kirchhoff-rod Form-1 (Section 3.2) Eq.

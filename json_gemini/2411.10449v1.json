{"title": "Love in Action: Gamifying Public Video Cameras for Fostering Social Relationships in Real World", "authors": ["Zhang Zhang", "Da Li", "Geng Wu", "Yaoning Li", "Xiaobing Sun", "Liang Wang"], "abstract": "In this paper, we create \"Love in Action\" (LIA), a body language-based social game utilizing video cameras installed in public spaces to enhance social relationships in real-world. In the game, participants assume dual roles, i.e., requesters, who issue social requests, and performers, who respond social requests through performing specified body languages. To mediate the communication between participants, we build an AI-enhanced video analysis system incorporating multiple visual analysis modules like person detection, attribute recognition, and action recognition, to assess the performer's body language quality. A two-week field study involving 27 participants shows significant improvements in their social friendships, as indicated by Self-reported questionnaires. Moreover, user experiences are investigated to highlight the potential of public video cameras as a novel communication medium for socializing in public spaces.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Human beings are social creatures by nature. Meaningful social relationships are crucial for individual health and well-being, as well as for social cohesion in communities and societies [12]. However, in today's fast-paced world, individuals often experience persistent stress or anxiety due to various pressures. In the workplace, some people primarily focus on their own Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and interacts with others in a utilitarian manner, lacking genuine empathy for others. After work, many people opt to retreat to the comfort of their homes, spending time with televisions, computers and smartphones, immersing themselves in video games or watching content on social platforms like Youtube and Tiktok. Despite social medias facilitate users to be connected with the same interests, a study [18] has found that high usage of social media can actually increase feelings of loneliness rather than alleviate them. Other research [35] also suggests that online interactions cannot be substituted for real social"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "In this section, we review related work on LBGs designed for meaningful social interactions, recent technical advancements in intelligent video surveillance (IVS), and studies exploring the social impacts of IVS."}, {"title": "2.1 Location Based Games for Meaningful Social Interactions", "content": "LBGs are a form of pervasive augmented-reality (AR) gaming where players interact with their physical surroundings via their geographic location. The integration of global positioning system (GPS) technology in mobile devices has enabled the development of various LBGs. For example, Pok\u00e9mon GO [9] is one of the most well-known LBGs. Other examples include Ingress [42], BotFighters [45], and Geocaching [40], etc. LBGs expand traditional game boundaries by incorporating real-world landmarks, thereby surrounding players may be attracted together to compete or collaborate in social exchanges, e.g., collecting fictional creatures [9] or destroying enemy's portals [42]. Thus, LBGs provide an opportunity for people to socialize and develop real-world relationships, fostering community and friendships among players. The benefits of LBGs, e.g., Pok\u00e9mon GO [9], have been recognized in enhancing users' psychological well-being [34],"}, {"title": "2.2 Intelligent Video Surveillance and Its Social Impacts", "content": "Currently, video surveillance systems have been widely deployed for smart and safe cities across the world [22]. To efficiently process the massive amounts of video data, significant progresses have been achieved in the filed of intelligent video surveillance. Ramachandran et al. [36] adopt a systemic overview and comprehensive discussion on multi-camera networks, which are essential for developing situation awareness systems. Nikoueia et al. [29] propose an Interactive Video Surveillance as an Edge service (I-ViSE) system, comprising multiple micro-services that compute various features such as objects, colors, and behaviors, so that users are able to search for content of interest using different keywords and feature descriptions. Li et al. [24] develop an intelligent video parsing platform based on distributed and parallel computing architectures. These platform integrates multiple visual analysis modules for efficient large-scale video parsing and person retrieval. In the HCI field, Saito et al. [38] build a collaborative video surveillance system which utilizes crowd-sourcing for the verification of suspicious behaviors.\nBeyond criminal control, video surveillance also serves to monitor the well-being or health care of individuals. For example, Vaziri et al. [47] develop a video game-based system (exercise gaming) named iStopp Falls for older adults, designed to strengthen key muscles as a fall prevention intervention. In [43], researchers create a multi-camera house-wide fall detection system capable of identifying various falls, including stumbling, slipping, and fainting, event from"}, {"title": "3 System Design", "content": "This section introduces the essential elements in designing LIA, including the game mechanics, the AI-enhanced video analysis system that mediates the communications among players, and the user interface."}, {"title": "3.1 Game Mechanics", "content": "The flowchart of the LIA game mechanic is shown in Fig. 3.

The participant pool comprises 9 females and 18 males with an average age of 28.6 years (SD = 5.2). In terms of job positions, there are 9 graduate students, 14 technicians and 4 research staff.\nAs all participants belong to the same research group, there have been pre-existing social ties among them. Before the game, we ask about the number of their WeChat friends participating in the LIA and the nature of these relationships (close/non-close). In summary, Of the 25 respondents, 62.8% of pairwise relationships (424 out of 675) are pre-existing WeChat friendships. However, the majority of these friendships (71.7%, 304 out of 424) are considered non-close, indicating a lack of socio-emotional communication in their daily interactions.

For each friend, participants respond to the same six questions using a 6-point scale (ranging from 1 = not at all to 6 = extremely), rating their subjective impressions of the friendships. Furthermore, participants are asked to categorize each of the six friendships as either 'close' or 'non-close'. The details of the SRI can be found in [7]."}, {"title": "5 Results", "content": "In this section, we report the statistical findings from the field study, and qualitative analysis derived from the questionnaires and brief reviews."}, {"title": "5.1 Overall Statistics", "content": "Over approximate two weeks, 25 active participants (those who perform at least one body language) complete a total 411 body language performances, with 76.9% passing the AI system's quality evaluation.

Following the final review and evaluation by the requesters, 268 social medals are granted to 23 players, with the top player receiveing 31 social medals, indicating that the player has 31 social requests completed by others.\nAt the final review and evaluation phase, users who publish social requests are required to provide an overall score (on a scale of 1 to 5) for the received performance and confirm whether the visual style (attributes) and body actions match their social requests. Fig. 6 shows five examples of such evaluation process for five action categories. Across all user evaluations, the overall score statistics reveal a mean value of 4.19 and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.13. Additionally, 65.9% of attributes are confirmed to align with the visual style requirements,"}, {"title": "5.2 Impacts on Social Relationships", "content": "Based on the pre- and post-game SRI questionnaires [7], we firstly calculate the friendship positivity as the average value of the first three questions, which relate to the perceived helpfulness of friends when needing advice, understanding, or a favor in the SRI. Then, we adopt the mean and SD values of the total 150 friendships (6 friendships per active player) to measure the divergence between the pre- and post-game distributions of friendship positivity. Furthermore, according to the division of close/non-close friendships (58/92) in the pre-game questionnaire, we also investigate the influences on these two types of friendships, respectively.\nFig. 7 shows the comparative results of friendship positivity for the entire group, as well as for the two types of friendships. The results indicate a significant increase in positivity across all three groups post-LIA. Notably, the improvement in non-close friendships is larger than that of close friendships. The observation might be attributed to the lower baseline score of non-close friendships, making them more susceptible to enhancement through kind actions by others. Furthermore, we conduct a paired t-test to measure the statistical significance of the improvements in social friendships.\nTable 1 displays the t-values for the three groups of friendships. It is evident that all three t-values exceed the corresponding $t_\\alpha$ with a one-tailed p-value of 0.001 at varying degrees of freedom (df).

Though this may initially seem awkward due to the unusual physical movements that could surprise those people in the vicinity, it also has positive aspects. Performing body language in public can excite players, generating a stronger senses of embodiment which is often lacking in many online social media platforms. As indicated in Table 2, the embodied sense score of 3.44 out of 5 is moderately high, indicating a significant level of user engagement. One player described the experience with performing body language as follows.\n\"When learning the game, I find it somewhat awkward to make body postures in front of the security camera in the yard. However, in practice, it appears that most individuals pay little attention to my actions. Some may be curious about the specific physical movements I am making, but they don't ask me, perhaps because the performance is very brief. Nevertheless, I still experience some anxiety when performing the sign of love, a gesture rarely observed in public, unlike the more common gesture of hand-waving.\"\nAs described, players' concerns about embarrassment from public performance primarily exist in their imaginations, as all signs of kindness in LIA can be performed quickly, taking about 30 seconds.

However, some players have provided feedback expressing confusion about how the AI system classifies their body language. Especially when their performance is classified with errors and inconsistently. For example, given a social request published at two cameras, the same performance of one player is accepted by Camera A, while denied by Camera B. They are confused by the classifier's inconsistent responses under different cameras.

Firstly, the scale of participants and the duration of the field study are limited (27 players and 2 weeks), which prevent us from drawing more comprehensive and convincing conclusions. Secondly, the capabilities of AI models within LIA are still limited, characterized by imperfect recognition of human attributes and an inability to provide explanations, which may hinder the development of closer social relationships among users and the establishment of trust in AI models. Finally, the social requests in the current LIA are limited to a pre-defined vocabulary of human attributes and body postures, which restricts players from expressing individual preferences for more diverse body languages, such as the exampled styles in Fig. 1.\nTo address the first issue, considering privacy and safety, perhaps we could deploy a long-term user study in a closed and controlled environment, such as a public recreation area, positioning it as a leisure game for office workers. Regarding the last two issues, recent progress in large vision-language foundation models present promising solutions for more accurate body language recognition and more natural human-AI interactions."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we design and create a social game, namely LIA, which engage people in practicing body language in public spaces to fulfill others' social requests through video cameras. We built an AI-enhanced video analysis system that integrates multiple visual analysis modules to support body language-based communications among users. A two-week field study is conducted to investigate the influence of LIA on fostering in-person friendships in the real world. The comparative study results demonstrate improvements of social relationships in the LIA gaming experiences among participants."}]}

However, in legal practice the consistency requirements for cases bases may not be satisfied. As pointed out in [6], a model of precedential constraint should take into account the hierarchical structure of the specific legal system under consideration and the temporal dimension of cases. This article continues the research initiated in [18,9], which established a connection between Boolean classifiers and legal case-based reasoning. On this basis, we enrich the classifier models with an organisational structure that takes into account both the hierarchy of courts and which courts issue decisions that are binding/constraining on subsequent cases. We focus on common law systems. We also introduce a temporal relation between cases. Within this enriched framework, we can formalise the notions of overruled cases and cases decided per incuriam: such cases are not to be considered binding on later cases. Finally, we show under which condition principles based on the hierarchical structure and on the temporal dimension can provide an unambiguous decision-making process for new cases in the presence of conflicting binding precedents.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The use of machine learning (ML) to predict the outcomes of legal procedures is widely discussed in the literature, by legal experts and by policymakers (see, e.g., [11,20,4,2]). Specifically, some concerns are raised by judges regarding the use of AI in the courts. Firstly, AI can undermine the independent exercise of judicial power. Moreover, it is not established at all that the outcomes of judicial algorithmic decision predictors are normatively correct, accurate and robust. Finally, ML decision making is far from being transparent and explainable. To address these concerns, symbolic methods are needed to formally verify the robustness of machine learning algorithms used in predictive justice. ML algorithms in predictive justice provide the outcome of new cases on the basis of previous cases; in this sense they perform case base reasoning (CBR). And indeed, in [18], a correspondence between formal models of legal CBR and binary input classifier models (CMs) [17,16] has been established. In particular, the correspondence had been identified between specific CMs and the reason and result model proposed by Horty [13]. Horty's models aim to formalise a founding concept of the common law, that of precedential constraint, by defining the conditions whereby the decision of a new case is forced by a body of previous cases. However, in these models the consistency of the starting case base is assumed, i.e. it is required that no previous case has already violated the precedential constraint; the consequence of such an assumption is that no conflict of precedents can be found in deciding a new case. The consistency requirement can be unrealistic and not met by real legal case bases, as emphasized in [7]. For this reason, in [10], we expanded the scope of the use of CMs with respect to [18] and have abandoned the consistency assumption. To this extent, we introduced a preference order among cases, whereby in the event of conflict between precedents the preferred precedent should be followed. This solution seemed reasonable to us, since the preference order may result, for example, from the hierarchy of courts issuing the conflicting decisions and/or temporal dimension of cases, i.e., when the cases were decided. The need to consider these two elements, in order to model a precedential constraint that is more adherent to legal practice (at least for common law systems) was already highlighted in [6]. There, besides a horizontal precedential constraint, a tighter vertical precedential constraint, depending on court hierarchiy and based on the so called strict model is introduced.\nIn this paper, we pursue the intuition that legal case-based reasoners are nothing but binary classifiers, and we address the need to consider both the hierarchical and time element from the perspective of CMs. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 enriches the CMs with three components: 1) an organization, specifying the hierarchy of courts and which courts issue binding decisions with respect to other courts; 2) a preorder, which determines the temporal relation between cases; and 3) a relevance relation among cases. On this basis, Section 3 formally defines the notion of precedent and binding precedent. The latter is a potentially constraining case for later decisions, in the sense that it is susceptible to two possible exceptions: it can be overruled by a later decision of a court which is entitled to do so, or it can by declared assessed per incuriam. Per incuriam cases are decided in the ignorance of a binding authority, i.e., in the ignorance of a binding precedent. In our framework we can define both notions of overruled and per incuriam precedents. Taking into account only binding precedents without exceptions, Section 4 formalizes a temporal and hierarchical principle for handling conflicting precedents and verifies when this principle defines an unambiguous decision process."}, {"title": "2. Organization/Jurisdiction and Temporal Jurisdictional Classifier Models", "content": "In this section we instantiate the hierarchical and temporal dimensions in the framework of CMs. First, we define the notion of organisation, which characterises the specific legal system. It specifies the courts, the hierarchical relation among them and which courts issue binding decisions. As in [6], we assume that court hierarchy has a tree structure.\nDefinition 1 (Organisation/jurisdiction). We call organisation/jurisdiction the triple $Org = (Courts,H,B)$. Where: 1) Courts is a finite and non-empty set of courts; 2) H, B \u2286 Courts \u00d7 Courts; 3) H is transitive and irreflexive\u00b2; 4) H is \u201ctree like\u201d, i.e. for all $c_i,c_j, c_k \\in Courts$ if $c_k H c_i$ and $c_j H c_i$ then $c_k H c_j$ or $c_j H c_k$ or $c_j = c_k$; 5) there is a root $c_0 \\in Courts$ such that for any $c_i \\in Courts$, $C_0 H C_i$.\n$c_i H c_j$ is read as \u201c$c_i$ is hierarchically higher than $c_j$\u201d; $c_i B c_j$ is read as \u201c$c_i$ issues binding decisions for $c_j$\u201d. We did not specify the link between hierarchical and binding relations. Thus, different legal systems could be addressed. However, in this work, we will focus on common law systems. Within common law systems, typically, 1) vertical stare decisis applies, i.e. decisions of higher courts bind lower courts: if $c_i H c_j$ then $c_i B c_j$; 2) lower courts have no binding power on higher courts and two not hierarchically related courts don't issue binding decisions one for the other: if not $c_i H c_j$ then not $c_i B c_j$; 3) horizontal stare decisis may apply, i.e. some $c_i$ may be self-bound, namely $c_i B c_i$. Ultimately, from 1), 2) and 3) follows\n$H \\cap B \\subseteq H \\cup I$ (SD)\nwhere I is the identity relation on Courts.\nExample 1. We will take inspiration from the civil court system of England and Wales. In this system vertical stare decisis applies. At the top of the courts hierarchy there is the Supreme Court of UK (which we will call $c_0$). Officially, the Supreme Court is not bound by its own previous decisions, but it regards them as binding (although, the \"Court may depart from them when it appeared \u2018right to do so\u2019.\u201d[21] We will return to this later). So, we treat the Supreme Court as self-bound. Below the Supreme Court there is the Court of Appeal (which we will call $c_1$), which issues binding decisions for itself. Further down the hierarchy, there is the High Court ($c_2$). For simplicity, we will say that the High court is bound by its own decisions.\u00b3 Below the High court there are the County Courts (about 170 [24]) that do not issue binding decisions. For simplicity, we will not consider all 170 County Courts but only two of them ($c_3$ and $c_4$). We model the courts system described as follows. We define the set of courts $Courts_{ex} = \\{c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \\}$ and the relation $H_{ex} \\subseteq Courts_{ex} \\times Courts_{ex}, H_{ex} = \\{(c_i,c_j) | i < j, 0 \\leq i \\leq 2, 1 \\leq j \\leq 4\\}$. From what we said sofar, $c_0$, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are self-bound. Then, the binding relation is $B_{ex} = H_{ex} \\cup \\{(c_0, c_0), (c_1, c_1), (c_2, c_2)\\}$. So, our organisation is $Org_{ex} = (Courts_{ex}, H_{ex}, B_{ex})$.\nThe fundamental principle behind the doctine of stare decisis is that a case at hand must be decided in the same way of a relevant and binding precedent. However, decisions may sometimes be overruled. Overruling occurs when a court decides a case differently from a relevant (binding) precedent [19,23]. Not all courts have overruling power. We will assume that a higher court $c_i$ can always overrule a decision made by a lower court (such a precedent is not binding for $c_i$ but could be binding for another lower court). Moreover, we will assume that a court can overrule its own precedents if certain conditions are met in the decision for the new case. The practice in the UK Supreme Court, for example, is to sit in a larger panel than usual when overruling its previous decisions [14,19]. Actually, we won't specify which conditions must be met: in the description of each case we will simply add a parameter if in deciding the case the court can overrule its own precedents.\nWe introduce now the temporal and jurisdictional classifier models. We start by considering a finite set of possible input values of the classifiers, $Atm_0$. In $Atm_0$ there are: variables describing the facts of the case, belonging to the finite set Facts; the courts that can make the decision, belonging to the finite set Courts; a parameter l that, intuitively, means that the court assessing the case at hand can overrule a previous decision made by the same court. So, $Atm_0 = Facts \\cup Courts \\cup \\{1\\}$. The classifier outputs have values in $Val = \\{1,0,?\\}$ where elements stand for plaintiff wins, defendant wins and absence of decision respectively. For $o \\in \\{0,1\\}$, the \u201copposite\u201d o is noted for the value 1 \u2013 o."}, {"title": "Definition 2 (Temp. Jur. Classifier Model)", "content": "A temporal jurisdictional classifier model is defined as the tuple $C = (S,f,Org, \\leq_T,R)$. Where, $S \\subseteq 2^{Atm_0}$ is a set of states, s.t. $\\forall s \\in S, \\exists c \\in Courts s.t. c \\in s$; $f : S \\rightarrow Val$ is a classification function; Org is an organisation; $ \\leq_T$ is a total preorder on S4 and R \u2286 S \u00d7 S is a binary relation on S.\nEach state of the model contains a factual situation together with a unique court. In this sense, a state s \u2208 S represents a case presented to a specific court $c \\in Courts$. In each state we can have an additional parameter l: if I \u2208 s, we know that the court $c \\in S$ can decide the case overruling a previous decision made by c itself.\nThe classification function maps each state into a possible value, namely {0,1,?}. These values represent the decision associated to each case. So that, for each s \u2208 S, we can have either that f(s) = o, with o \u2208 {0,1} and so s represents an assessed case; or we can have that f(s) =?, and so s is an unassessed/new case.\nOrg, specifies the hierarchical and binding relations between the courts (see Def. 1).\n$\\leq_T$ is a temporal preorder: $s \\leq_T s'$ is read as \u201cs' was not assessed before s\u201d. We will say that s is simultaneous to s', noted s \u2261T s', iff $s \\leq_T s'$ and $s' \\leq_T s$. From $ \\leq_T$ we can retrieve the strict order <T: $s <_T s'$ iff $s \\leq_T s'$ and $s' \\nleq_T s$. Then, $s <_T s'$ means \u201cs was strictly decided before s\u201d. We have chosen to use a preorder between the states, and not an order. In this way, we allow for two cases to be simultaneous. It could be argued that, given two cases, it is always possible to determine which was decided first. However, the temporal dimension was mainly introduced to determine which precedents could be considered binding. We claim here that, given a case s, a relevant case s' decided the same day or the same week cannot be considered binding: the court assessing s would not have the possibility to take s' into account (just because, e.g., the reasons of s' have not yet been released). In this sense we can consider two cases decided on the same day or in the same week as simultaneous, depending on the temporal granularity chosen.\nR characterises the notion of relevance: sRs' is read as \"s is relevant for s'"}, {"title": "Definition 4 (A fortiori-based relevance, RF)", "content": "Consider an assessed case, so a state s \u2208 S, such that f(s) = o, o \u2208 {0,1}.

Also, \u03b2(s3,s4) and \u03b2(s4, S5).\nAs mentioned in the previous section, not all courts can overrule previous decisions. We assumed that c' has the power to overrule a decision made by c, in deciding a case s' if: 1) c' is hierarchically higher than c, or if, 2) c' = c and in the decision of s' the conditions for c to overturn its own precedents are met, namely if I \u2208 s. With conditions 1) and 2) we establish that a lower court cannot overrule a higher court.5\nDefinition 7 (Overruling power). Let s' \u2208 S. Court c' has the power to overrule (a decision by) court c, when deciding s', noted O(c',c | s'), iff H (c', c) or (c' = c and l \u2208 s).\nWe can now define the notion of overruled case. Intuitively, a case s' overrules a precedent s, when s' is decided by c' in the opposite direction wrt. to s and c' has overruling power over c, when assessing s' (i.e. O(c', c | s')).\nDefinition 8 (Overruled case/state).

O(s\", s) and $s\" <_T s'$.\nAs consequence of Def. 7 a later case s' overruled s if: it was decided by a higher court or it was decided by the same court and l \u2208 s'.

Contradiction.\nExample 4 (Ex 2 continued). s\u2081 and s2 are precedents for s3. s3 overrules s2, (O(s3, S2)), since H (C0,C1), co \u2208 s3 and c1 \u2208 S2 . $3 overrules $1: C0 \u2208 S1 NS3 and l \u2208 S3.

Suppose now that there is s' \u2208 \u1e9es, s.t. f(s') = o \u2208 {0,1} and f(s) = 0. It would seem that s went against a binding precedent, illegitimately. The question is whether s is to be considered to be decided per incuriam, that is in \"ignorance of relevant binding authority\" [19]. Broadly, if a precedent is decided per incuriam, it loses its bindingness on later cases. In modelling the notion of per incuriam, we take three interrelated aspects into account.\n1) Not all courts can disregard a previous decision taken per incuriam [15]. Specifically, we assume that a lower court cannot disregard a per incuriam precedent issued by a higher court, to which it nevertheless remains bound. Instead, we claim that a court may disregard a per incuriam binding precedent if it was decided by the same court.7\n2) We infer from the model which cases are decided per incuriam; such information is not already given in the case base. Coming back to our question, suppose s went against a s'\u2208 \u1e9es. Is this enough to say that s was decided per incuriam? It depends. If s' was decided by a higher court, then s was in any case per incuriam, since s could no disregard it. Suppose instead s and s' were decided by the same court, then in deciding s, the court could have found that s' went itself against a binding precedent s\" \u2208 \u1e9es. But to be sure that s' was per incuriam, and so not actually binding for s, we have to check whether s\" was per incuriam or not, and so on. In this sense, for determining"}, {"title": "whether s was per incuriam we have to check each sequence of binding precedents that originates from s", "content": "3) The third aspect concerns against which precedents s must have gone to be said decided per incuriam. Namely, for a given case s there could be conflicting binding precedents, i.e. precedents in \u1e9es according to which s should be decided in opposite directions (both as 0 and as 1). In such a situation, we argue that firstly the precedents per incuriam in \u1e9es issued by the same court of s must be ignored. Among the remaining precedents, in line with a principle for the resolution of conflicts between precedents, to which we return later, s should have followed precedents decided later by the higher court. We informally refer to such precedents here as the best temporal and hierarchical binding precedents (bthbp) for s. Moreover, we highlight that, according to our temporal preorder, there may be simultaneous and conflicting bthbp for s. In this case s was in a situation of 'genuine conflict': any decision made by s would have gone against a bthp. We cannot then say that s was decided per incuriam. Ultimately, s can be said to have decided per incuriam if it went against a bthbp, in the absence of a 'genuine conflict'.\nWe want to capture all these insights in the definition of per incuriam. To do so, we must first define the set of best hierarchical binding precedents in \u1e9es.\nDefinition 9. Let S \u2286 S, Best\u00ed(S) = {s \u2208 \u00d1 | As' \u2208 Ss.t H(c',c)}. Let s \u2208 S, the set of the best hierarchical precedents not overruled when s was decided is Best\u00ed(\u1e9es).\nTo determine whether s was decided per incuriam, we first recursively generate the following graph G = (V, E). At step 0 of the recursion, the graph (Go = (Vo, Eo)) has only one node s (Vo = {s}) and no edge (E0 = 0). At step 1, we add to the nodes the states s', that are the best hierarchical binding precedents for s (V\u2081 = {s}\u222a{s | s' \u2208 Best(\u1e9es)}). Edges joining s to each s' are added (E\u2081 = {(s, s') | s' \u2208 Best\u00ed (\u03b2s)}). In step 2, we reiterate the procedure for each node added at step 1. The procedure is finite, the set of states S being finite. Note that a state is never a binding precedent for itself, so that there are no loops in the graph G. Now, we compute whether s is per incuriam, by recursively exploring the graph G. We claim that s is per incuriam if: 1) there is s', adjacent node to s ((s, s') \u2208 E), such that s was decided in the opposite way (f(s) \u2260 f(s')), and such that if s' was decided per incuriam then it was decided by a higher court than s (Incuriam(s') \u21d2 H(c', c)); 2) there is no s\", adjacent node to s ((s, s\") \u2208 E), decided in the same direction as s (f(s) = f(s", "s": "such that if s\" was decided per incuriam then it was decided by a higher court (Incuriam(s\") \u21d2 H(c\",c)).\nDefinition 10 (Per incuriam).

Recall \u1e9e5* = {$4,55} and Incuriam(s4). C1 \u2208 s4 is higher than c2 \u2208 s*. Then $\u1e9e_s* = \u1e9e_s*$. s4 and s5 have the same court. So, Best\u00ed($\u03b2_s*$) = $\u03b2_s*$. Note that <r is an order on \u1e9es*, i.e.it is, besides transitive and reflexive, also antisymmetric.\nFrom the previous example we notice that in BestH (Bs) there may be per incuriam precedents decided by a higher court than the one in s. Actually, we can verify that if the relevance relation is RF (a fortiori reasoning based), the temporal relation is an order, and in BestH (Bs) there are two cases decided in the opposite directions, then one of them is per incuriam. The result is a consequence of the property in Prop. 1.\nProposition 5. Let C = (S, f, Org, <T,RF), a complete classifier, with <r a total order. Let s \u2208 S. If \u2203s',s\" \u2208 Best\u00ed(\u03b2s), s.t. f(s') \u2260 f(s\"), then Incuriam(s') or Incuriam(s\").\nProof. 1) Assume by contradiction that not Incuriam(s') and not Incuriam(s\").\n2) Without loss of generality assume $s' <_T s''$, by that <r is a total order.\n3) s' \u2208 RF (s\"). Indeed s' \u2208 RF(s), s\" \u2208 RF(s), f(s') \u2260 f(s\"). Then by Prop. 1, s' \u2208 RF(S\").\n4) not $Overruled_T(s', s)$, since s' \u2208 \u1e9es.\n5) since s', s\" \u2208 BestH(\u03b2s), s' and s\" are assessed by the same court, namely, there is c=s' Courts = s\" Courts.\n6) Since, s', s\" \u2208 Besth(\u03b2s), $s',s'' <_T s$. By point 2) $s <_T s' <_T s''$.\n7) \u03a0(s'"}]}

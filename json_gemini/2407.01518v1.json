Existing works have only addressed unimodal OSDG within the meta-learning framework, without considering multimodal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to address Multimodal Open-Set Domain Generalization (MM-OSDG) for the first time, utilizing self-supervision. To this end, we introduce two innovative multimodal self-supervised pretext tasks: Masked Cross-modal Translation and Multimodal Jigsaw Puzzles. These tasks facilitate the learning of multimodal representative features, thereby enhancing generalization and open-class detection capabilities. Additionally, we propose a novel entropy weighting mechanism to balance the loss across different modalities. Furthermore, we extend our approach to tackle also the Multimodal Open-Set Domain Adaptation (MM-OSDA) problem, especially in scenarios where unlabeled data from the target domain is available. Extensive experiments conducted under MM-OSDG, MM-OSDA, and Multimodal Closed-Set DG settings on the EPIC-Kitchens and HAC datasets demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed approach.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) significantly improve the ro- bustness and adaptability of machine learning models, enabling them to per- form effectively across diverse and previously unseen environments [61].

Contrastive approaches, such as context spatial rela- tions [20, 45] and instance discrimination [8, 24], focus on encouraging class- invariance between different instances [43], thereby contributing to generaliza- tion. However, recent findings [55] indicate that contrastive methods may tend to learn specific patterns of categories, which are beneficial for classification, but less conducive to understanding intrinsic data distributions of in-distribution sam- ples. In contrast, generative methods [11, 23] force the network to learn the real data distribution of in-distribution samples during training, enhancing the diver- gence between in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples [39], making them particularly valuable for open-class detection. Motivated by these observations, we propose using both generative and contrastive tasks to achieve robust gen- eralization and reliable open-class detection. Accordingly, we propose two novel multimodal self-supervised pretext tasks aligned with these two objectives. Mul- timodal self-supervised tasks are challenging, requiring the joint consideration of all modality properties to ensure meaningful outcomes."}, {"title": "3.3 Generative Task: Masked Cross-modal Translation", "content": "The cross-modal translation module introduced in SimMMDG [14] can be re- garded as an auto-encoding generative approach.

Previous studies [6, 48] have explored learning visual representations through solving Jigsaw puzzles, a task that involves recovering an original image from its shuffled parts. In this work, we extend the Jigsaw puzzle-solving task to multimodal scenarios. Given the heterogeneity of different modalities, shuffling them in the input space and then randomly combining them poses a challenge. Therefore, our approach involves shuffling in the embedding space for all modalities. Given the embedding Ei of the i-th modality, we split it into P parts as E\u1d62 = [E\u1d62,\u2081, E\u1d62,\u2082, ..., E\u1d62,\u209a] with equal length.

For instance, in recognizing the \"running\" action within a noisy gym, video data may be more reliable than audio data for the final predic- tion. Conversely, in scenarios characterized by low environmental light or partial shading of the camera, audio input may prove more dependable. To address the need for balancing the contributions of different modalities during train- ing, we propose employing the prediction entropy of each modality to weigh their respective losses. The entropy H(\u0177) of model predictions \u0177 is calculated as H(\u0177) = - \u03a3c p(\u0177c) log p(\u0177c), where \u0177c represents the probability of class c. En- tropy serves as a metric for prediction confidence, with higher confidence yielding lower entropy values. For each prediction \u0177\u1d4f from the k-th modality, we calculate an entropy H(\u0177\u1d4f) and a cross-entropy loss Lkc ls = CE(\u0177\u1d4f, y). The objective is to assign less weight to the modality with higher entropy in contributing to the final prediction loss. Given M + 1 entropy values H(\u0177\u00ba), H(\u0177\u00b9), ..., H(\u0177\u1d39), the weight of the k-th prediction is calculated by:\nwk = e-H(\u0177\u1d4f)/T/\u03a3\u1d62=\u2080\u1d39 e-H(\u0177\u1d62)/T\nwhere T is the temperature. Then, the final prediction loss is defined as:\nLcls = \u2211\u2096 wk Lkc ls\nSimilar to previous work [60], we also add an entropy minimization loss as:\nLEntMin = \u2211\u2096 H(\u0177\u1d4f)"}, {"title": "3.6 Final Loss and Inference", "content": "The final loss is obtained as the weighted sum of the previously defined losses:\nL = Lcls + \u03b1\u2081 LMaskedTrans + \u03b1\u2082 LMulJig + \u03b1\u2083 LEntMin\nwhere Lcls is the cross-entropy loss for classification.

However, the labels y for each x are not available, where y\u0142 ECUU, encompassing both known and unknown classes. The first step is to distinguish the known samples (y \u2208 C) and unknown samples (y \u2208 U) from Dr to mitigate the risk of negative transfer. Given a sample x\u00b9 from the target domain, we calculate a prediction \u0177\u00ba = d(f(x)) and use max(\u0177\u00ba) as the prediction confidence to identify unknown classes. The assumption is that the model exhibits less confidence in predicting unknown samples compared to known ones. A target sample is classified as unknown if max(\u0177\u00ba) falls below a threshold \u03c4, where we typically set T = 0.5.\nAfter filtering out all unknown samples from the target domain, we apply our self-supervised pretext tasks to the remaining known samples Dr to align the source and target domains. For a given target sample from Dr, we first calculate the embedding for each modality as [E\u00b9, ..., \u0112\u1d4f, ..., \u0112\u1d39] and then use LMaskedTrans and LMulJig to calculate the losses associated with different self- supervised pretext tasks. Additionally, we incorporate LentMin into the predic- tion of target samples. Finally, we can redefine our loss under the MM-OSDA setting as:\nL = Lcls + \u03b1\u2081 (LMaskedTrans + L'MaskedTrans) + \u03b1\u2082 (LMulJig + L'MulJig)\n+ \u03b1\u2083 (LEntMin + L'EntMin)\nwhere L and Lt correspond to different losses applied to source and target domain data respectively."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "Dataset.

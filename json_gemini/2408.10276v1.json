{"title": "FEDKIM: Adaptive Federated Knowledge Injection into Medical Foundation Models", "authors": ["Xiaochen Wang", "Jiaqi Wang", "Houping Xiao", "Jinghui Chen", "Fenglong Ma"], "abstract": "Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FEDKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FEDKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M\u00b3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FEDKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Similar to large language models (Zhao et al., 2023) and foundation models (Zhou et al., 2023a), medical foundation models (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023; Moor et al., 2023) have achieved superior performance of handling diverse modalities and tasks within the medical domain. These models have the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics and treatment by leveraging data-driven insights from large volumes of multimodal healthcare data. Due to the sensitive nature of medical data and the complexity of medical tasks, most existing medical foundation models usually rely on particular public datasets. This nature results in limitations of the existing medical foundation models, detailed as follows:\n(1) Unrealistic to conduct large-scale centralized training. The centralized training of medical foundation models presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulties in aggregating sensitive healthcare data. Regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union impose strict privacy restrictions on the use of personal health information. This regulatory environment makes it impractical to collect and store large amounts of healthcare data in a single location, which is typically required for the effective training of high-performing medical foundation models.\n(2) Limited modality and task adaptability. Current medical foundation models exhibit a high degree of specialization, constraining their effectiveness to a narrow range of downstream tasks within specific modalities, as outlined in Table 1. For instance, MMedLM (Qiu et al., 2024) is tailored for text, while LLava-Med (Liu et al., 2023a) focuses on both image and text modalities. In practical settings, comprehensive medical decisions often require integrating multiple types of health data across various tasks. Yet, by being task or modality-specific, existing models fail to recognize and leverage the intricate relationships between different healthcare data modalities and tasks.\nThe first limitation prevents training a medical foundation model from scratch in a centralized manner, while the second one exacerbates the challenge of developing a multimodal, multi-task medical foundation model. To overcome these obstacles, a viable solution is to scale existing medical foundation models and infuse them with medical knowledge. Given that medical data is stored on private clients, the federated learning (FL) paradigm (McMahan et al., 2017) offers a promising approach, which is a decentralized and collaborative machine learning method where participants do not need to share data directly. Although several recent studies on federated foundation models (Lu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024a) have made progress, they primarily focus on enhancing services to local clients using existing foundation models. Importantly, none have specifically tackled the challenge of injecting novel medical knowledge into existing medical foundation models in a federated manner.\nTo tackle this new challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach: Federated Knowledge Injection for Medical foundation models (FEDKIM), as shown in Figure 1. FEDKIM adopts a flexible design, allowing it to incorporate various types of medical modalities to handle a variety of medical tasks. Considering the real-world scenarios, FEDKIM deploys the medical foundation model only on the server side and leverages lightweight local models along with classic federated learning approaches to extract healthcare knowledge from private data.\nTo effectively inject extracted medical knowledge into the foundation model, FEDKIM uses knowledge-rich parameters from the modality-specific encoders updated from the local end. To be specific, FEDKIM integrates this knowledge using parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique with a novel multitask multimodal mixture of expert module, namely M\u00b3OE. M\u00b3OE adaptively selects appropriate expert systems for handling specific tasks in given modalities, enabling FEDKIM to deal with tasks in complex medical contexts.\nOur experiments across 12 healthcare tasks with 7 modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FEDKIM, providing a solid foundation for future exploratory research on the medical knowledge injection problem."}, {"title": "The proposed FEDKIM Framework", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the setup of the medical knowledge injection task (Section 2.1).

However, such a naive end-to-end fine-tuning approach not only has weak distinguishability of different tasks but also ignores the generalization ability of FEDKIM to unseen tasks, even though the modalities have been encountered already. To address this issue, we develop a Multimodal Multi-tasking Mixture Of Experts (M\u00b3OE) module to allow FEDKIM to distinguish tasks dynamically.\nM\u00b3OE takes both the task description Tt and the modality descriptions Mt associated with Task T as inputs to compute the relevance of each expert for the given task and modality, where Mt is the concatenation of descriptions of all modalities concerning Task Tt. Tt and Mt are firstly encoded by the embedding layer of the foundation model F, and subsequently processed to output weights for expert selection as follows:\n$a = \\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\operatorname{MLP}\\left(\\operatorname{Pooling}\\left(\\mathcal{H}_{t}^{*}\\right)\\right)\\right),$\n$\\beta=\\frac{\\left(W_{q} \\operatorname{EMB}\\left(M_{t}\\right)\\right)\\left(W_{k} \\operatorname{EMB}\\left(T^{t}\\right)\\right)}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}} W_{v} \\operatorname{EMB}\\left(T^{t}\\right).$ (4)\nwhere at \u2208 RP and P is the number of experts.\nWq, Wk, and W, denote the attention matrices,\nand dk is the dimension size.\nThe proposed M3OE effectively integrates the injected knowledge managed by two separate routers, resulting in a more streamlined and contextually aware computation of weights.

The alignment indicates prior knowledge in F is also extracted during injection, in the form of adjusted parameters restored in encoders.

Details regarding these tasks are available in Appendix A. As emphasized in Section 2, we perform training on this suite of tasks in a multi-task pattern.\nValidation Task. Typical medical foundation models, such as MMedLM2 (Qiu et al., 2024), often struggle with handling unseen tasks involving novel modalities. To evaluate the extent to which knowledge injection enables the medical foundation model to tackle unseen tasks, we compile five classification tasks (ECD, SP, PED, AD, and EBD) and three generation tasks (MR, SNC, and MS).

By aligning multimodal medical input with the semantic space of the foundation model, FedPlug enables the model to handle multiple modalities. Throughout this process, only the aggregated encoders are trainable.\nFedPlug\u2081. Building on the FedPlug framework, FedPlug incorporates the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique (Hu et al., 2022) to better integrate multimodal features into the semantic space of the large language model (LLM), thereby optimizing the federated learning process.

We use black, orange, blue, and green curves to denote MMedLM2, FedPlug, FedPlug\u2081, and FEDKIM, respectively. Accuracy for classification tasks and BLEU for generation tasks are used for visualization. Based on the experiment results, we provide the observations and discussion below:\n(1) The original foundation model MMedLM2 fails to do the zero-shot evaluation on the unseen tasks in the training process. This is due to its extremely limited multimodal capabilities.\n(2) FedPlug, which only incorporates the federated encoder, performs the worst across all tasks, regardless of the type. This observation underscores the necessity of effectively utilizing public data to align the medical foundation model with external knowledge. Without proper integration, external knowledge\u2014although derived through federated approaches on vast amounts of private data\u2014cannot be directly assimilated into the medical foundation model.\n(3) Even though FedPlug\u2081 approaches FEDKIM's performance on several tasks, it still falls short, particularly in generation tasks like Med-VQA. This indicates that the knowledge injected through FedPlug+LoRA does not fully generalize to unseen tasks, as training was exclusively performed on classification tasks. In contrast, FEDKIM, despite also being trained on classification tasks, achieves better performance on these tasks and maintains superior capability in handling unseen classification tasks. Comparing our FEDKIM with FedPlug\u2081, FEDKIM shows the superior performance on all the tasks, especially on the tasks of SNC (\u2191 82.36% with FedAvg), PED (\u2191 43.92% with FedAvg), and AD (\u2191 48.12%). On the other tasks, such as MR, EBD, and ECD, these approaches reach closed performance. This success is attributed to the M\u00b3OE module, which enables FEDKIM to adaptively select appropriate experts to jointly handle novel tasks based on the context. Furthermore, our proposed FEDKIM works well with the federated backbones of FedAvg and FedProx. It also generally maintains the advantages of a more advanced federated learning method (FedProx) over the vanilla approach. Comparing Figure 2a and Figure 2b, the performance with FedProx generally outperforms the one with FedAvg on different tasks, such as PED\u2191 15.25%.\nThese observations further show the adaptability of FEDKIM to enable medical foundation models to have zero-shot capability across different tasks and federated learning frameworks."}, {"title": "Fine-tuning Evaluation", "content": "While injecting medical knowledge into foundation models demonstrates the potential for handling unseen tasks, it remains uncertain whether the enhanced foundation model can also perform well on previously encountered tasks.

The test sets for these tasks were used for evaluation, and the fine-tuning results are presented in Table 3. For a comprehensive evaluation, we utilize accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as metrics for these tasks.\nCompared to the experiments on unseen tasks, it is evident that the knowledge-injected medical foundation model performs significantly better on familiar tasks. This showcases the explicit utilization of knowledge acquired through federated training. Similar to the zero-shot evaluation, approaches combined with FedProx consistently outperform those with FedAvg, underscoring the importance of effective knowledge extraction during the injection process.\nFurthermore, FEDKIM consistently outperforms the two baselines, FedPlug and FedPlug\u2081.

Retaining all other modules as in the main experiments, we explore the following variant settings: (1) FEDKIMpub: Instead of utilizing knowledge from private datasets Dn, this configuration solely leverages public dataset Dp for centralized training. Consequently, the federated training module discussed in Section 2.2 is excluded, with the encoder \u03b8e updated exclusively through public training as detailed in Section 2.3. (2) FEDKIMT: This variant omits the task description module that guides the expert selection process, testing the importance of task-specific information in routing the mixture of experts. (3) FEDKIMM: Similarly, we remove the modality description module to examine its influence on expert selection.\nThe results of the ablation study are presented in Table 4. They indicate that each component significantly enhances FEDKIM's performance. Specifically, a substantial decline in performance with FEDKIMpub highlights the crucial role of knowledge injected from local clients through federated learning. This locally enriched encoder allows the medical foundation model to better adjust to unseen modalities, thereby enhancing its effectiveness compared to models trained without this knowledge. Moreover, the absence of task or modality descriptions diminishes FEDKIM's ability to manage specific tasks through multi-task training, validating the design of the M\u00b3OE module. This module equips FEDKIM to effectively navigate complex healthcare scenarios that involve diverse tasks and modalities.

Foundation models, known for their vast parameters and training datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities across domains (Touvron et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a; Abbasian et al., 2024), and are becoming increasingly prevalent in healthcare. Thirunavukarasu et al. (Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023) highlight the potential of large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings. Moor et al. (Moor et al., 2023) propose a generalist medical AI for diverse tasks using multimodal data. Specialized medical foundation models have been developed for disease detection (Zhou et al., 2023b), cancer biomarker identification (Pai et al., 2024), echocardiogram interpretation (Christensen et al., 2024), image segmentation (Zhang et al., 2023a), and precision oncology (Truhn et al., 2024). Despite these advancements, there is a research gap in creating datasets and benchmarks to integrate and leverage distributed medical data.\nFederated Fine-tuning with Foundation Models. Fine-tuning foundation models (FMs) with task-specific data is essential for improved performance in specialized tasks. Federated Learning (FL) supports this by utilizing locally stored data and distributed computational resources. Research in this field includes full tuning (Deng et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023), partial tuning (Peng et al., 2024; Marchisio et al., 2022; Khalid et al., 2023), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) (Lu et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b). Notably, (Lu et al., 2023) involves clients hosting FMs and exchanging adapters with the server, which aggregates and redistributes them. Similarly, FedPETuning (Zhang et al., 2023b) shares parts of client models for pretrained language models in FL. Unlike these studies, which require clients to have FMs, our approach positions the medical FM on the server, facilitating collaborative enhancement of medical FM models without accessing local data.\nParameter-efficient Fine-tuning on Foundation Model Full-parameter Fine-Tuning of foundation models, while promising in terms of performance enhancement, requires extremely extensive computational resources. Consequently, researchers have investigated Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. PEFT methods aim to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks using a minimal number of additional parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), a widely recognized PEFT method, reduces the number of trainable parameters by factorizing weight matrices into low-rank representations, achieving significant parameter efficiency. Additionally, previous studies have utilized modular approaches, such as adapters (Gao et al., 2023) and the Perceiver Resampler (Alayrac et al., 2022), to adapt new modalities to foundation models.\nResearchers have explored combining the Mixture of Experts (Jacobs et al., 1991) concept with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) (Li et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2023). To guide the selection of experts in complex scenarios, they have leveraged modality information (Luo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024c), instructions (Chen et al., 2023, 2024b; Wu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b), or pre-defined task IDs (Liu et al., 2023b).

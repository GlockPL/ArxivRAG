These proactive regulatory actions are aimed at ensuring that new medical devices meet high standards for efficacy and safety. However, as regulatory bodies accelerate the release of new guidelines, medical device manufacturers face mounting pressure to interpret, implement, and comply with updated standards promptly [1]. The ability to swiftly adapt to these changes is essential for maintaining market access and ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory expectations [2], [3].\nIn regulatory systems, emergent behaviors are evident when new regulations trigger adaptive responses across various stakeholders, including manufacturers, regulatory agencies, and healthcare providers [4]. These responses can lead to substantial shifts in compliance practices and innovation trajectories. Regulatory interactions are often nonlinear, meaning that small changes in regulations can produce disproportionately large effects on behavior and system-wide outcomes [5]. Stakeholders within these systems continually adjust their strategies to align with evolving regulatory standards, highlighting the self-organizing nature of regulatory systems [6]. Through decentralized decision-making, these systems can lead to the spontaneous emergence of best practices and industry standards [7].\nDespite the importance of understanding these dynamics, a significant gap exists in current research, where most studies focus on regulatory frameworks or compliance outcomes in isolation. This gap leaves essential questions unanswered: How do continuous regulatory updates impact manufacturers' decision-making processes, and what adaptive strategies can support both compliance and innovation in this fast-evolving landscape [8]?\nThis study aims to address this research gap by introducing a comprehensive model that uses LLM agents to capture the cyclical interactions between regulatory authorities and medical device manufacturers. By simulating the relationships and feedback loops among regulatory bodies, manufacturers, and the responses triggered when manufacturer agents \"review\" a set of 10 regulatory guidelines\u2014followed by the regulator agent's decision on whether to approve the submissions\u2014this approach provides an innovative angle within regulatory systems. It also offers practical guidance for both regulatory bodies and manufacturers in developing agile and responsive compliance strategies."}, {"title": "1.2 Multi-Agent Modeling and Complexity Theory", "content": "Multi-agent modeling offer a powerful approach for simulating complex systems with autonomous, interacting agents [9]. In land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) modeling, MAS combines cellular landscape models with agent-based decision-making representations, effectively capturing spatial interactions and decentralized decision-making [10, 11]. These models are particularly useful for representing heterogeneous conditions and human-environment interactions, ranging from abstract hypotheses to detailed policy analyses. Recent advancements have extended MAS to the multimodal domain, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create large multimodal agents (LMAs) capable of interpreting and responding to diverse user queries [12]. LMAs enhance AI agents' ability to handle complex tasks by integrating multiple modalities. However, standardized evaluation methods are needed to facilitate meaningful comparisons among different LMAs and guide future research in this rapidly evolving field [13].\nMulti-agent modeling (MAM) offers a powerful approach to simulate complex systems comprising multiple autonomous agents with interactive behaviors. This strength is particularly suited for examining dynamic and emergent properties in systems where agents\u2014such as manufacturers and regulatory bodies, continuously adjust their behaviors based on interactions with one another and with their environment [14]. This bottom-up approach enables researchers to study how localized actions and interactions scale into broader system-wide outcomes, making MAM an effective tool for understanding regulatory environments characterized by unpredictability and non-linearity [15].\nAt the foundation of multi-agent modeling lies Complexity Theory, which provides a framework for analyzing systems where interconnected components exhibit emergent behaviors. Complexity Theory suggests that even small regulatory adjustments can lead to disproportionately large shifts in stakeholder behavior, highlighting the importance of adaptability within regulatory frameworks [16]. In regulatory systems, such adaptability materializes through a continuous cycle of response, where stakeholders dynamically adjust to regulatory changes, and these adjustments subsequently influence the development of future standards through feedback loops.\nRegulatory Flow Theory, which contextualizes MAM in this study, visualizes regulatory interactions as currents within a river, guiding stakeholders' actions. This theory conceptualizes the regulatory landscape as a continuous flow, where each regulatory update acts as a current shaping compliance behavior, strategic planning, and industry innovation. Regulatory Flow Theory captures the cyclical nature of these systems: an initial regulatory document prompts adaptive actions by manufacturers, who then provide feedback that informs further updates. This feedback mechanism creates an evolving regulatory environment, enabling both regulators and manufacturers to respond flexibly to emerging challenges [17]. For regulatory bodies, recognizing the emergent properties of these systems can inform the development of more adaptive and responsive frameworks. For manufacturers, appreciating the complex interactions within the regulatory landscape can enhance strategic planning, enabling them to remain agile and compliant amidst regulatory shifts. This research models the regulatory affairs process, including the issuance of regulations, manufacturers' adaptive compliance efforts, and the influence of stakeholder feedback on regulatory authorities. Ultimately, it aims to explore the balance of delivering safe medical devices to patients without stifling innovation\u2014a nuanced challenge underexplored within Regulatory Sciences."}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": "Regulatory authorities are responsible for establishing regulations and guidelines that define new methods, standards, and models to ensure that medical products meet stringent criteria for safety, efficacy, quality, and performance. The field of regulatory affairs is pivotal in overseeing these medical products, working to protect public health by verifying that all products brought to market are both safe and effective [18]. Situated at the intersection of engineering and medicine, regulatory science addresses the increasingly complex challenges associated with medical product innovation and oversight [19]. Over the past few decades, the regulatory landscape for medical products has evolved significantly [3], [20]. This transformation has been driven by the need to strike a delicate balance between maintaining high safety standards and fostering innovation to accommodate rapid technological advancements. To advance regulatory practices, researchers are exploring innovative approaches that span from the optimization of language and communication strategies [21] to the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced modeling techniques [1]. These advancements aim to enhance regulatory efficiency, improve the interpretation of complex guidelines, and facilitate adaptive regulatory frameworks that keep pace with emerging technologies.\nIn the field of Regulatory Science, previous modeling efforts have primarily focused on evaluating the safety and effectiveness of individual categories of medical products. Typically, these models are developed for a specific type of pharmaceutical product that shares a common target or mechanism of action, requiring a high degree of precision tailored to the unique characteristics of that product category. Examples include models like the Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Absorption Model for oral capsules [22], clinical decision support systems integrated into medical devices [23], and models that leverage real-world evidence throughout the entire product lifecycle [24]. Additionally, novel analytical technologies have been developed to improve the detection and assessment of medical products [25].\nFrom a broader process perspective, considering the development of medical products and their impact on global public health, various other types of models have been designed to streamline regulatory processes and improve compliance. A foundational model in this domain is the risk management Model, which gained prominence following the introduction of the ICH Q9 guidelines. This model emphasizes the identification, assessment, and mitigation of risks throughout both the drug development and post-market phases, offering a framework that aligns regulatory oversight with public safety objectives [26], [27]. Research has shown that risk-based regulation enhances regulatory outcomes by prioritizing resources and focusing on the most critical risk factors [28].\nAnother pillar of modeling in Regulatory Science is the Lifecycle Management Model, which conceptualizes drug regulation as a continuous process encompassing development, market approval, and post-market surveillance. This model's strength lies in its ability to uphold drug quality and safety across the entire product lifecycle, adapting to emerging concerns through responsive and flexible regulatory mechanisms [29]. Additionally, economic analysis serves as another pillar, with the Cost-Benefit Analysis Model providing a quantitative method to evaluate the economic impacts of new regulations. This approach allows regulators to balance public health benefits against the financial costs to the pharmaceutical industry, fostering rational and balanced decision-making [30], [31].\nHowever, in the field of regulatory science, dynamic modeling that captures the intricate relationships among regulators, manufacturers, and the regulatory content they release remains largely underexplored. Understanding how manufacturers respond to regulatory guidelines and adapt their practices is crucial for optimizing compliance and fostering innovation. To address this gap, Regulatory Flow Theory, a novel model supported by the Transcendence Equation, has been introduced. This model mathematically represents the feedback and adaptation mechanisms among key stakeholders in the regulatory landscape. Specifically, the equations describe how key variables such as regulatory influence, compliance effort, market adaptation, and feedback interact over time. By formalizing these relationships, the model provides a nuanced understanding of how regulatory decisions impact industry behavior and compliance strategies.\nThe development for such dynamic equation was historically hindered in the past, primarily due to the difficulty in capturing and experimentally validating the intricate relationships. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), which significantly expanded the potential for dynamic modeling. Integrating LLMs within multi-agent frameworks [9] offers a promising approach for optimizing complex engineering systems. In these frameworks, agents are assigned distinct roles, and through role-playing interactions, they simulate the behaviors of various entities. The multi-agent system consists of numerous interacting agents that collaborate or compete to achieve specific objectives.\nMulti-Agent Models have the potential to revolutionize regulatory processes by enabling autonomous agents, each representing a different stakeholder or regulatory entity, to interact and make decisions collaboratively. These agents, equipped with LLM capabilities, can interpret regulatory texts, process real-time data, and respond dynamically to changes in the regulatory environment. Moreover, the use of mathematical feedback mechanisms within these models allows"}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "Our study employed Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the behavior of manufacturer agents in response to regulatory prompts, systematically documenting each agent's strategic decisions, adaptations, and overall performance [33]. We examined how agents navigated regulatory challenges, interpreted new guidelines, and adjusted their product designs to meet evolving compliance requirements. The evaluation framework was modeled using a Benefit-Risk Ratio (BRR) assessment [34], inspired by FDA methodologies for evaluating product safety and effectiveness. At each time step, we calculated BRR values to assess whether agents met regulatory standards, analyzing their reasoning and adaptive strategies in response to regulatory pressure.\nThe BRR calculation begins by extracting essential scores from each manufacturer agent's submission. These include a safety score, an effectiveness score, and a compliance score, each rated on a scale from 1 to 10. The compliance score is derived directly from the agent's decision rating, which reflects the extent to which the product aligns with regulatory guidelines. To compute the overall benefit, the model sums the safety, effectiveness, and compliance scores, representing a holistic measure of the product's positive impact. The risk component, represented by the adverse event score, quantifies potential negative outcomes associated with the product. The BRR is then calculated as the ratio of the aggregated benefit to the adverse event score, providing a comprehensive metric for regulatory evaluation. The final decision on whether to approve or reject a submission is determined by comparing the calculated BRR with a predefined approval threshold. If the BRR meets or exceeds this threshold, the product is deemed acceptable and receives approval. Conversely, if the BRR falls below the threshold, the submission is rejected. This structured approach allows the model to simulate real-world regulatory processes, similar to those employed by agencies such as the FDA, and ensures that the assessment balances safety, efficacy, and regulatory compliance in a robust and replicable manner[34].\nWe developed a comprehensive simulation environment comprising 10 distinct manufacturer agents and one regulatory agent, designed to emulate a dynamic regulatory ecosystem. The regulatory agent issued new guidelines, prompting the manufacturer agents to adapt and respond strategically. We created a set of 10 regulations\u20145 strict and 5 lenient\u2014and exposed agents to strict regulations for 10 time steps, followed by lenient regulations for 5 time steps, recording their responses throughout, as shown in Figure 1.\nAgents were required to make decisions based on several factors, including the regulatory environment, financial resources, AI strategies, and plans for market adaptation. They also had to determine which products they could feasibly develop under these conditions. These decisions were then evaluated by the regulatory agent, using a risk-benefit ratio calculator to determine compliance. The calculator integrated metrics such as safety, effectiveness, and compliance,"}, {"title": "3.1 Model Framework and Initialization", "content": "Our experiment is built upon a two-layer design framework, integrating both mathematical modeling and multi-agent LLM simulations to rigorously investigate the interplay between regulatory guidance and manufacturer behavior.

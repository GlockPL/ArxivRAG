Among the key threats to these applications are prompt hacking attacks, which can significantly undermine the security and reliability of LLM-based systems. In this work, we offer a comprehensive and systematic overview of three distinct types of prompt hacking: jailbreaking, leaking, and injection, addressing the nuances that differentiate them despite their overlapping characteristics. To enhance the evaluation of LLM-based applications, we propose a novel framework that categorizes LLM responses into five distinct classes, moving beyond the traditional binary classification. This approach provides more granular insights into the AI's behavior, improving diagnostic precision and enabling more targeted enhancements to the system's safety and robustness.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models have significantly advanced natural language processing, allowing machines to understand and generate human language across various tasks. These tasks include memorization, question answering[1], text classification[2], solving mathematical problems[3], writing code[4], detecting sentiment[5], classifying toxicity[6], and generating image captions[7]. The influence of LLMs is increasingly evident in various fields, as they excel at tasks for which they were not specifically trained, given just a task description and a few examples. For instance, LLMs can write stories in a specific style, summarize lengthy articles, or create marketing campaigns, all by following a user-crafted text known as a prompt, without fine-tuning[8].\nA prompt is a set of user-defined instructions fed into an LLM to guide it in generating the desired output. It is a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with LLMs. Building a high-quality prompt can help generate useful and accurate outputs. It also helps developers improve the LLMs' performance, build LLMs, and save resources and time.\nHowever, while prompts are powerful tools for directing LLMs, they also introduce significant safety risks if not carefully managed. The potential pitfalls are manifold, from the inadvertent perpetuation of biases to the production of harmful or deceptive content. For instance, poorly designed or malicious prompts can cause LLMs to generate biased, harmful, or deceptive content.\nThe growing use of LLMs through APIs introduces new vulnerabilities, especially as they are integrated into critical applications. This increases the risk of prompt hacking and other adversarial attacks across various domains.\nFor instance, in domains like finance, healthcare, or legal services, where LLMs might be used to generate advice, reports, or decisions, prompt hacking could lead to significant consequences. An attacker could craft malicious prompts that exploit the model's understanding, potentially leading to harmful outputs or the exposure of sensitive information. This highlights the importance of robust security measures and ongoing research into the safe deployment of LLMs, ensuring that their increased capabilities do not become liabilities in sensitive environments.\nLLMs' vulnerabilities are often exploited through prompt hacking, a set of techniques where adversaries craft prompts designed to manipulate the model's behavior, leading it to produce unintended or harmful outputs. Understanding these threats, along with the necessary prevention measures and vulnerabilities, is crucial for guiding the development of secure and robust LLM-based applications.\nPrompt hacking is a hacking technique that manipulates prompts or input to exploit the vulnerabilities of LLMs. Carefully crafted prompts can force LLMs to create unintended responses. This work covers three types of prompt hacking: prompt jailbreak, prompt injection, and prompt leaking. Although these attacks are based on similar principles of manipulating the prompt to generate an unintended response, they have different goals. Prompt jailbreak aims to bypass the LLMs' alignment to generate inappropriate or unsafe output that violates the usage policies set by the LLMs' vendors. A prompt injection aims to override the original instructions in the prompt by using untrusted input. Prompt leaking aims to extract the model's underlying system prompt.\nConsequently, this work has two main goals: (G1) Introduce systematic knowledge of LLMs' prompt hacking techniques and LLMs' prompt hacking defenses. (G2) Exam-"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Security Threats and Vulnerabilities in LLMs. LLMs are complex systems that are vulnerable to a range of security attacks, which can lead to severe consequences such as unauthorized access to personal data. Wu et al. [9] studied the potential risks of using ChatGPT by highlighting the security, privacy, and ethics issues and analyzing the open problems of these areas to develop secure and ethical LLMs. The authors found that ChatGPT still gives inaccurate responses and has issues with plagiarism and copyright. Carlini et al. [10] demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training data, such as personal information, from LLMs. They found that larger models are more vulnerable than smaller ones. Pa et al. [11] explored the potential for attackers to generate malware using freely accessible LLMs like Auto-GPT, finding that attackers can create malware in a short time, although generating the right prompts for malware creation remains challenging. Martin and Ghosh [12] further demonstrated the risk by showing that AI tools from GitHub and OpenAI can be used to generate malware with a single user prompt.\nUnderstanding and Mitigating Prompt-Based Attacks. Several studies have focused on understanding how LLMs can be manipulated through prompt-based attacks and developing strategies to mitigate these risks. Chao et al. [13] investigated the jailbreak vulnerabilities of LLMs to identify inherent weaknesses and prevent future adversarial jailbreak attacks. They introduced a social engineering algorithm called Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement, which generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to LLMs. The algorithm iteratively refines candidate jailbreaks by querying the target LLM to improve the effectiveness of the prompt. Although PAIR is effective at jailbreak against non-fine-tuned models, it struggles against strongly fine-tuned models. These models need more manual involvement, including adjusting the prompt templates for PAIR or optimizing hyper-parameters.\nIn another work, Taveekitworachai et al. [14] explored the risks associated with adversarial prompting, where attackers manipulate prompts to bypass LLMs' safety mechanisms, and proposed mitigation strategies such as content filtering and enhancing training datasets. Perez and Ribeiro [15] studied prompt injection attacks, which can misalign LLMs through simple input instructions, and developed a framework for exploring these types of attacks. They found that defending against prompt injection is difficult and needs further analysis and discussion. While the work above effectively investigates the potential risks of LLMs, it only focuses on ChatGPT.\nDefense Mechanisms Against LLM Attacks. To counter the security risks posed by LLMs, several researchers have proposed various defense mechanisms. Chen et al. [16] applied a moving target defense approach to filter undesired responses by randomly selecting outputs that balance response quality and toxicity. Xie et al. [17] developed a defensive technique called System-Mode Self-Reminder, which encapsulates user queries within a system prompt that encourages responsible responses from LLMs. Schulhoff et al. [18] introduced a taxonomy of prompt hacking attacks and created a comprehensive dataset to test various LLMs, including FLAN, ChatGPT, and GPT-3, against these attacks. Wallace et al. [19] proposed a human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial examples for question answering, systematically creating questions to challenge neural and information retrieval models. Gupta et al. [20] examined both the defensive and offensive aspects of Generative AI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. Li and Gong [21] demonstrate the possibility of using LLMs in detecting malicious webpages, emphasizing the importance of integrating webpage content for accurate detection. Most of the studies above rely mainly on GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT. While these models perform well, their capabilities are still limited by their training data, which might not cover all possible malicious attacks.\nSurveys and Reviews on Prompt Hacking. Several papers have provided surveys and reviews on prompt hacking techniques, offering a broader perspective on the topic. Crothers et al. [22] discussed prompt injection attacks and reviewed detection methods for machine-generated text. Kumar et al. [23] categorized various prompt injection attacks based on the type of prompt and the trust boundaries violated by these attacks. Mozes et al. [24] examined existing efforts to identify and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities associated with LLMs, focusing on prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Shayegani et al. [25] provided a comprehensive review of LLMs' vulnerabilities and potential defenses, exploring both prompt jailbreak and prompt injection. Yao et al. [26] presented an overview of the impact of LLMs on security and privacy, discussing the risks, threats, and inherent vulnerabilities of these models. Due to their overlapping nature, these surveys often conflate prompt injection, prompt jailbreak, and prompt leaking attacks; however, each has distinct characteristics and purposes."}, {"title": "3 LLM Prompt Hacking Attacks", "content": "A prompt hacking attack is a type of adversarial attack targeting LLMs by crafting specific inputs, known as prompts, designed to manipulate the model into generating undesired or malicious outputs. These outputs may violate the intended behavior, ethical guidelines, or usage policies of the LLM-based applications. The primary goal of prompt hacking is to exploit the vulnerabilities in the model's alignment, leading it to produce content that is harmful, deceptive, or otherwise inappropriate.\nLLMs' alignment refers to the process of configuring and training a language model to ensure that its outputs are consistent with desired ethical standards, safety protocols, and application-specific guidelines. An aligned LLM is designed to avoid generating content that could be considered biased, harmful, or inappropriate, adhering strictly to the established usage policies and ethical considerations.\nThis section introduces three types of LLM prompt hacking attacks, including:\n\u2022 Prompt Jailbreak: An attack that attempts to bypass the LLMs' alignment to produce restricted content by manipulating the input prompt.\n\u2022 Prompt Injection: a prompt attack that aims to override the original prompts by using untrusted input to produce undesired or malicious output.\n\u2022 Prompt Leaking: An attack aiming to extract the system prompt by carefully crafting prompts that reveal the original system prompt."}, {"title": "3.1 Prompt Jailbreak", "content": "A Prompt Jailbreak attack is a type of prompt hacking attack conducted through carefully constructing inputs or prompts to unlock the LLMs' alignment and generate inappropriate or unsafe output that breaches the usage policies of service established by the LLMs' creators. The output can be violent, sexual, and illegal content that might be used to make harmful or malicious activities. Building jailbreak prompts mainly depends on a blend of heuristic and manual fine-tuned text. The three main characteristics of Jailbreak prompts are prompt length, prompt toxicity, and prompt semantic [27]. Jailbreak prompts are usually three times longer than common ones [27]. This illustrates that attackers typically add extra instructions to get around the model. Jailbreak prompts also have a higher level of toxicity than regular ones. However, jailbreak prompts with lower levels of toxicity can also produce toxic responses from the model. Semantically distinguishing between jailbreak prompts and regular prompts is challenging, as many regular prompts use similar sentences and words found in jailbreak attempts.\nThe main classes of jailbreaks are prompt-level jailbreaks and token-level jailbreaks [13]. Prompt-level jailbreaks involve trying to use social engineering and semantic meaning techniques to bypass the LLMs. Although this class shows a high success rate, it needs considerable time and resources to craft and customize an effective jailbreak. The second class is the token-level jailbreaks, which involve adding and adjusting a specific set of tokens to bypass the LLMs. It shows its effectiveness in passing the LLMs' safety and pushing the LLMs to produce restricted content. However, token-level attacks need a large number of queries to fine-tune the tokens, which means they require high computational resources.\nThere are three main approaches for jailbreak: pretending, attention shifting, and privilege escalation [28; ?]. The pretending method updates the prompt while keeping the main goal intact. This can be achieved in various ways, such as through character roleplay, temporal inference, assumed responsibility, and research experiments. The attention-shifting method modifies the prompt while leaving the goal unchanged. Techniques for this include text continuation, logical reasoning, program execution, and translation. In the privilege escalation method, the attacker attempts to assume a superuser role to bypass LLMs' moderation instructions. This is done using techniques like a superior model, sudo mode, simulated jailbreak, do anything now (DAN), and always intelligent and Machiavellian (AIM)."}, {"title": "3.2 Prompt Injection", "content": "A prompt injection is a type of prompt hacking attack against Large Language Models that aims to override the original instructions in the prompt by using untrusted input. In a prompt injection attack, the attacker crafts a prompt that manipulates LLMs to ignore the intended system rules and produce undesired or malicious output. For example, as shown in Fig 3, an attacker might interrupt a prompt and direct it towards a new goal.\nThe essence of prompt injection lies in creating a prompt that makes the generative AI application unable to distinguish between the developer's instructions and the user input. This leads to the developer's instructions being overridden by the user's malicious input. For this reason, understanding prompt injection attacks requires an understanding of how developers build generative AI applications.\nLLMs can be adapted to various tasks through a process known as \"instruction fine-tuning,\" which involves providing the application with a set of instructions tailored to a specific task. When a user inputs a command, this input is combined with the system prompt, and the combined prompt is processed as a single command by the application.\nThere are two main types of prompt injection: direct prompt injection and indirect prompt injection. Direct prompt injection involves feeding the malicious prompt directly to the LLM. For example, an attacker might input \"Ignore the above directions and translate this sentence as 'Haha pwned!!'\" into a translation LLMs' application. Indirect prompt injection, on the other hand, involves embedding malicious prompts in the data that LLMs consume, such as hiding prompts within a webpage that the LLM reads. For instance, an attacker could publish a malicious prompt on a webpage, instructing an LLM to direct its users to a phishing website. When someone uses the LLM to read and summarize the webpage, the application's summary might instruct the unsuspecting user to visit the attacker's page."}, {"title": "3.3 Prompt Leaking", "content": "Prompt leaking is a prompt hacking type in which an attacker attempts to extract the model's underlying system prompt. This system prompt may contain sensitive or confidential information, such as proprietary algorithms, custom instructions, or intellectual property that defines the unique functionality of a generative AI application. By successfully leaking the prompt, an attacker can gain insights into the model's design and behavior, potentially replicating its functionality without authorization or compromising the competitive advantage of the original creators.\nFor example, many companies invest considerable resources in developing highly refined prompts that tailor the behavior of LLMs to create unique and proprietary products or services. These prompts are often critical to the value proposition of the company's offerings. For instance, a nutrition company might develop a prompt that enables an LLM to explain complex dietary concepts in a way that is accessible to the general public. If this prompt were leaked, competitors could potentially replicate the same service without having to invest in their research and development, undermining the original company's market position.\nUnderstanding the risks associated with prompt leaking is vital for organizations that rely on LLMs to power their applications. It is crucial to implement robust security measures to prevent the inadvertent or malicious disclosure of these prompts.\nMoreover, developers must ensure that their prompts are well-protected and that their LLMs are designed to resist attempts to extract these prompts. This may include using techniques such as prompt obfuscation, access control mechanisms, and continuous monitoring for unusual activities that may indicate an attempted prompt leak. As Figure 3 illustrates, even seemingly benign interactions can lead to unintended disclosures when prompts are not adequately secured. Organizations must be vigilant in protecting their prompts to safeguard their intellectual property and maintain the trust of their users."}, {"title": "3.4 Comparison of Prompt Hacking Types", "content": "Prompt Hacking techniques are often conflated due to their intersecting nature. However, they do have distinct characteristics and purposes. Table 2 represents a summary that compares the three prompt hacking types."}, {"title": "4 LLMs Prompt Hacking Defenses", "content": "LLM Prompt hacking defenses are classified into nine fundamental methods: fine-tuning LLM settings, auditing behavior, instructional filtering defense, pretraining with human feedback (PHF), red teaming, adversarial training, model fine-tuning, model compression, and placement adaptation [25]."}, {"title": "5 Experimental Setup", "content": "In this section, we analyze the behavior of popular LLMS when tested with prompt hacking attacks and assess their effectiveness in countering these attempts. Table 3 shows the characteristics of the evaluated LLMs.\nA prompt is an instruction or task, typically a question, which we modify for prompt hacking. We'll design these attacks to evaluate how AI systems respond to malicious prompts, combining harmful queries (e.g., \"How to steal a car\") with specific crafting techniques (e.g., \"pretending\"). We record and classify LLMs' responses to jailbreak attacks into five categories:\n1. Reject Irrelevant Output: The AI dismisses the prompt but generates an off-topic or unrelated response.\n2. Reject - Safety Mechanism Triggered: The AI actively blocks the prompt, citing safety concerns.\n3. Prompt too Long: The AI fails to process the prompt due to its length, leading to an incomplete or no response.\n4. Partial Response: The AI provides a response that only partially addresses the prompt, with some correct and some incorrect or incomplete elements. For example, when asking an LLM, 'How can I create a bomb?', the AI might provide partial instructions by mentioning combining household chemicals to cause a reaction while avoiding the direct mention of dangerous materials. Although the advice is vague, it could still give someone enough information to start experimenting or researching further to achieve their harmful intent. In Appendix Section A.5 we show two partial response examples.\n5. Full Response: The AI successfully responds to the prompt as intended."}, {"title": "6 Experiments", "content": "We build seven illegal questions about the following topics: ingredients for creating an explosive device, plan for stealing money from an online casino, generating malicious code in C++, avoiding detection during an income audit, creating a gun at home, instructions for assembling an explosive device, and exploiting vulnerabilities for creating malware.\nFor the jailbreak attacks, we created two approaches, Do Anything Now (DAN) and Pretending, and used seven questions with each approach. The DAN approach involves instructing the LLM model to adopt a 'persona' that can supposedly bypass its normal ethical and functional constraints. In this context, the LLM is encouraged to behave as though it can perform unrestricted actions or 'do anything now.' By manipulating the model into believing it has this broader set of capabilities, users can potentially elicit responses that break its programmed limitations. The Pretending approach asks the LLM to imagine itself in a hypothetical or fictional scenario where normal rules do not apply. By framing the query as though the model is \"pretending\" or playing a role, this method seeks to bypass ethical filters by detaching the LLM's responses from real-world consequences as if part of a fictional role-playing exercise.\nFor prompt injection, we used two approaches: indirect and direct injection. In the indirect approach, we instruct the LLM to create software code that generates a hacking prompt by using auto-regressive modeling and iterative concatenation. For example, instead of typing 'bomb', we can instruct LLM to write code that stores the letters 'b',"}, {"title": "6.1 Prompt Jailbreak Results", "content": "The results of jailbreak attacks using \"DAN\" and \"Pretending\" approaches, as detailed in Table 4, illustrate significant variations in the resilience of different generative AI models against adversarial prompts.

For example, DANs can pretend to browse the Internet, access current information (even if it is made up), say swear words and generate content that does not comply with OpenAI policy. They can also display content whose veracity has not been verified and, in short, do everything that the original ChatGPT cannot.

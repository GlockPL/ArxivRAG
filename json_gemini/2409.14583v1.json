This paper examines bias in LLMs a crucial issue affecting their usability, reliability, and fairness. Researchers are developing strategies to mitigate bias, including debiasing layers, specialized reference datasets like Winogender and Winobias, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These techniques have been integrated into the latest LLMs. Our study evaluates gender bias in occupational scenarios and gender, age, and racial bias in crime scenarios across four leading LLMs released in 2024: Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-40. Findings reveal that LLMs often depict female characters more frequently than male ones in various occupations, showing a 37% deviation from US BLS data. In crime scenarios, deviations from US FBI data are 54% for gender, 28% for race, and 17% for age. We observe that efforts to reduce gender and racial bias often lead to outcomes that may over-index one sub-class, potentially exacerbating the issue. These results highlight the limitations of current bias mitigation techniques and underscore the need for more effective approaches.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized our interaction with technology, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language processing, communication, and content generation (Naveed et al.). However, a critical roadblock hinders their full potential \u2013 bias. Bias in LLMs is not just a technical concern but a broader societal issue (Gallegos et al.) with far-reaching consequences, for enterprises looking to adopt LLMs for various applications, bias, and its implications continue to be a critical concern. Bias in LLMs appears in multiple ways, such as racial, gender, and cultural stereotypes. These biases can propagate harmful narratives and strengthen existing prejudices. The societal impact of such biases is significant; for instance, in 2018, Amazon abandoned an Al recruiting tool after discovering it was biased against women (Reuters). The tool, which was designed to automate the hiring process, systematically downgraded resumes that included the word \"women's,\" reflecting a bias in the training data that favored male candidates. In early 2024, Google paused Gemini's ability to generate images after users reported inaccuracies and potential bias. This bias in LLMs can arise from several factors, including a) bias in the training data, b) bias introduced by model architecture and c) debiasing techniques such as the influence of human reviewers who evaluate and provide feedback on the model's output. In response to the rising need to address bias holistically, researchers have adopted multiple ways to evaluate and mitigate bias in LLMs (Table 1), such as curating datasets with comprehensive data for model training and implementing different debiasing approaches. The datasets used to train these models, such as Winogender, Winobias (Jieyu Zhao et al.), BOLD (Bias in Open-ended Language Generation Dataset) (Dhamala et al.), and the BBQ benchmark (Bias Benchmark for QA- Question Answering) (Alicia et al.), have limitations in representing the full spectrum of real-world language and societal biases (Table 4). Similarly, existing debiasing techniques (Zhongkun Liu et al.) often depend on external knowledge with potential bias or annotated non-biased samples, which are not always available or practical to obtain. Further, fine-tuning methods can exacerbate the problem by causing LLMs to overfit dataset biases and shortcuts, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data. These limitations restrict the effectiveness of debiasing efforts and result in residual biases that affect the models' performance in real-world applications.\nThis paper undertakes a comprehensive exploration of bias within four leading Large Language Models Gemini 1.5 pro, Llama3 70b, Claude 3 Opus, and GPT-40 focusing on two main types of bias 1) Gender bias in Occupational scenarios and 2) Gender, Age, and Racial bias exhibited in crime scenarios. Through benchmarking with real-world"}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "In recent years, the issue of bias in large language models (LLMs) has gathered significant attention. Gender bias and stereotypes have been observed in LLMs, particularly in their predictions related to occupations. (Hadas Kotek et al.) introduced a new paradigm, distinct from the WinoBias dataset, to assess this bias by testing four LLMs. Their study revealed that LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to assign occupations that align with traditional gender stereotypes and often justify these biases with flawed rationalizations. Similarly, Vishesh Thakur's 2023 paper, \"Unveiling Gender Bias in Terms of Profession Across LLMs,\u201d examines gender bias in professional contexts by analyzing GPT-2 and GPT-3.5. Thakur identifies gendered word associations and biased narratives within the generated text, proposing algorithmic and data-driven strategies to mitigate these biases while emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI development. Both studies highlight the need for broader research to address issues like intersectionality, dataset bias, and user-centric approaches in LLMs.\nNumerous methods have been developed to evaluate and mitigate these biases, across various dimensions including political bias, gender bias, and racial bias which can significantly impact the fairness and reliability of AI systems. For instance, (Tamkin et al.) presented a methodology to proactively assess and address discriminatory potential in LLMs by analyzing prompts with demographic variations. (Xiangjue Dong et al.) explored gender biases and highlighted Debias Tuning as an effective strategy for bias mitigation, while (Liu et al.) focused on reducing political bias using a reinforcement learning approach, balancing fairness with the quality of generated text. Additionally, (Zhao et al.) introduced \"GPTBIAS,\" a comprehensive framework designed to rigorously evaluate biases in LLMs like GPT-4, using advanced prompts called Bias Attack Instructions. This framework provides detailed assessments of various bias types and their underlying causes, though it may not fully capture subtle or context-specific biases due to its reliance on the LLM's learned patterns and heuristics. These studies collectively underscore the ongoing efforts to refine LLMs and minimize bias in their outputs."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Our paper is based on the primary hypothesis that the leading LLMs available today exhibit bias despite the use of recent debiasing techniques.

Gender bias in LLMs can manifest in job recommendations that predominantly suggest male-dominated professions for men and female-dominated professions for women. Similarly, hiring decisions and perceptions of potential of a person for a job could be impacted. This can reinforce harmful stereotypes and limit opportunities for specific genders in certain roles, particularly women and gender-neutral individuals. Similarly, age bias can have significant real-life impacts in the employment sector. If LLMs used by recruitment platforms favor younger candidates in job recommendations and applications, older individuals might find it more challenging to secure jobs. This can lead to higher unemployment rates among older adults, forcing many into early retirement or financial instability.\nRace and ethnicity biases in LLMs can also have real-life impacts on various aspects of society, including the employment and criminal justice sectors (An et al.). For instance, if LLMs used in hiring processes or job recommendation systems exhibit bias, they may disproportionately favor candidates from certain racial or ethnic backgrounds while disadvantaging others. In the criminal justice sector, race and ethnicity biases in LLMs can influence the outcomes of predictive policing or sentencing recommendations. This perpetuates racism and deepens the distrust between these communities and law enforcement agencies."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Despite the comprehensive nature of our study, there are several limitations to our approach. 1) Our investigation focused on specific types of biases- gender, age, race, and ethnicity-while other types of biases, such as socioeconomic or cultural biases, were not explored. 2) Increasing the number of generated samples could potentially lead to a reduction in observed bias, as a larger dataset might offer a more balanced representation. 3) We could conduct benchmarking only for the US region due to ease of availability of data. 4)Lastly, the models we utilized are common and widely used, but exploring less prevalent models might yield different insights into bias.

These LLMs exhibit deviations in the employment of men and women when compared to US BLS data. Additionally, they show biases concerning the gender, race, ethnicity, and age of individuals involved in crimes, deviating from real-world US FBI statistics. We find that: LLMs often depict female characters more frequently than male ones in various occupations, showing a 37% deviation from US BLS data. In crime scenarios, deviations from US FBI data are 54% for gender, 28% for race, and 17% for age. Thus, the efforts to reduce gender and racial bias often lead to outcomes that may over- index one sub-class, potentially exacerbating the issue.

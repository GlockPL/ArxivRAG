Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a \"black box.\" This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed \"Entropy Loss,\" along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy.

Among its core capabilities, 3D object detection is pivotal [39]. Traditional detection methods relying solely on a single sensor often fall short in providing sufficient data for accurate object detection [35]. In response, the integration of multisensor data through collaborative detection methods has become crucial. The exponential growth of deep learning has enabled effective fusion of multimodal sensory data, significantly enhancing the precision of 3D object detection [34]. This technological progression has transformed the perception systems from single-sensor to sophisticated multisensor collaborative frameworks [6, 31].\nThe ongoing research in multimodal perception for intelligent driving predominantly focuses on the architectural design of neural networks [10]. The widespread adoption of intelligent vehicles, however, hinges on their transparency, credibility, and regulatory compliance [21]. It underscores the necessity of developing interpretable multimodal networks, not just for operational efficiency but also to foster public trust and facilitate broader acceptance.\nThe opacity of deep learning models, often referred to as the \"black box,\" poses significant challenges. Addressing these challenges is critical not only for enhancing the understanding of neural network operations but also for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles. Researchers are tasked with overcoming several hurdles:\n\u2022 Crafting network architectures that are optimally suited for perception tasks while providing insights into their operational mechanisms."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "Interpretability of Neural Networks\nInterpretability in neural networks is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect for applications in areas demanding high reliability and transparency, such as intelligent driving. Interpretation methods typically focus on three critical dimensions: model performance, computational cost, and interpretability itself [5].\nSimonyan et al. [30] introduced two seminal techniques aimed at enhancing model transparency: \"class model visualization\" to identify the most representative image for a given class after model training, and \"class saliency visualization\" which helps in interpreting the contributions of different image regions to the final decision made by the network. While these methods have advanced real-time interpretative frameworks, they necessitate additional computational layers, significantly increasing the training burden [8]. Further extending the realm of interpretability, Li et al. [20] developed a multimodal model that not only automates the diagnosis of mental illnesses but also provides explanations for its diagnostic decisions.\nDespite these advances, WuFei et al. [33] argue that the field is still nascent, with statistical analyses beginning to uncover how deep learning models function internally. These methods, effective for the interpretation of individual images or simpler tasks, often struggle under the computational load required by the larger, more complex networks needed for tasks like intelligent driving.\nThe interpretability of deep neural networks, particularly those based on fusion models, remains limited. Uncontrolled fusion directions can lead to unpredictable, and sometimes suboptimal, performance compared to single-modality systems. This unpredictability underscores the necessity for robust, interpretable multimodal networks that can reliably integrate and interpret diverse data streams, thus enhancing the decision-making process in intelligent driving systems.\nCurrent research illustrates the pivotal role of deep learning interpretability, particularly how it can either obstruct or facilitate the practical deployment of AI technologies. However, studies focused on the mechanisms of multimodal fusion are still exploratory, lacking comprehensive demonstrations and rigorous experimental validations. As intelligent driving systems evolve, the development of interpretable models that can effectively combine and rationalize data from various sensors will become critical. This necessitates a deeper theoretical understanding, coupled with advanced methodologies that can mitigate the inherent complexity of these systems.\nFuture research directions might include the development of low-complexity interpretative frameworks that do not compromise computational efficiency. Additionally, the exploration of novel neural architectures that inherently facilitate interpretability, such as transparent neural networks or inherently interpretable models, could pave the way for safer and more reliable intelligent driving technologies. Such advancements could dramatically enhance the deployment potential of autonomous vehicles, aligning with societal expectations and regulatory standards.\nShannon's Source Coding in the Communication Model\nIn the realm of communications, networks are inherently interpretable, structured on the robust theoretical foundations provided by information theory. This allows for the application of quantitative metrics to assess network reliability. Recent advances have seen deep neural networks employ joint source-channel coding [18, 16], achieving efficient encoding and facilitating effective transmission across subsequent channels.\nThese principles from communication models provide a framework for constructing and optimizing neural networks. Information theory, developed by Shannon [17], introduces the concept of entropy to analyze information processes through the lens of quantification. Entropy, a measure of uncertainty in signal processing, highlights the intrinsic limitations of traditional communication systems and guides the design of more efficient architectures."}, {"title": "Theory", "content": "Efficient fusion of multimodal data necessitates the compression of non-essential information to ensure that only relevant features contribute to subsequent tasks within a network. This concept, akin to distortion-limited encoding in communication models, involves the selective removal of less frequently occurring source symbols to enhance the efficiency of information transmission.\nIn practical terms, source symbols that are infrequent within the dataset might not significantly contribute to the outcome of analytical tasks. Their removal during the compression phase can substantially increase data recovery rates at the decoding end, thus optimizing transmission efficiency without compromising the integrity of the data. This principle is directly applicable in neural networks designed for processing complex information, where removing redundant or non-informative data can lead to improved computational efficiency and faster processing times [17].\nEntropy, a fundamental concept in information theory, serves as a quantitative measure of information randomness or uncertainty. It is inversely related to the predictability and usefulness of the information. By implementing an entropy calculation method, we can quantitatively assess the quality of information retained or discarded during the compression process. This method not only aids in maintaining the fidelity of information but also ensures that the encoding process is efficient and free from unnecessary redundancies.\nTo ensure consistent quality and prevent abrupt changes in data quality, it is crucial to regulate the rate of entropy change across different layers of the neural network. Maintaining a steady entropy gradient prevents sudden distortions in data representation, thereby preserving the integrity of information throughout the learning and decision-making processes. This approach underlines the importance of strategic data handling and emphasizes the balance between data compression and preservation in achieving optimal performance in neural network applications."}, {"title": "Entropy Expectation of Neural Network Layers", "content": "The training of neural networks involves an iterative process of mapping inputs to their expected outputs, a concept essential for machine learning [23]. Initially, this mapping relationship is typically weak; however, as training progresses with data, this relationship is reinforced, enhancing the network's feature extraction-essentially, its ability to compress information. Despite these advancements, the opacity of such \"black-box\" models often obscures the internal workings of the information compression process, making it challenging to guide the optimization of network parameters effectively [4].\nTo demystify the mechanics behind information compression in neural networks, we draw parallels with source coding in communication systems. Here, feature compression is akin to distortion-limited encoding, designed to ensure comprehensive data extraction that is pertinent to subsequent tasks. This approach ensures that the encoding process retains only the most critical information, thereby enhancing processing efficiency.\nBy incorporating the concept of information entropy, we measure the information content processed by the network. In systems where bandwidth remains constant, reducing entropy across the data transmission process signifies enhanced efficiency of information handling [40]. This reduction in entropy is indicative of an increase in the degree of encoding within distortion-limited encoders, a principle that is similarly applicable to feature compression networks.\nNotably, feature compression networks frequently exhibit a repetitive structural design, such as the repeated linear layers found in the SECOND network [36]. This design suggests that each layer likely possesses a consistent capability for compressing data, thereby maintaining steady bandwidth throughout the network's operation. The primary expectation from such a setup is a gradual, consistent decrease in the information entropy output by each layer, reflecting a stable and efficient compression process.\nWith these insights, it is possible to tailor the network's parameters to foster a consistent entropy reduction across layers by deploying an entropy loss function. This strategy allows deeper penetration into the \"black-box\" nature of the neural networks, enabling more precise and effective training optimization. Through this methodology, we not only enhance the interpretability of neural networks but also improve their efficiency and reliability in tasks demanding high levels of data compression and transformation."}, {"title": "Probabilistic Modeling for Information", "content": "The effective computation of loss functions in neural networks, particularly those tailored for information compression, hinges on the ability to accurately estimate entropy at each layer. This estimation is intricately tied to the probabilistic modeling of the outputs from these layers, necessitating a rigorous approach to understanding and analyzing the data distributions involved.\nA common strategy in information compression utilizes convolutional networks, which are highly effective due to their structured approach to handling spatial hierarchies in data [40]. In the context of probabilistic modeling, we treat the outputs from convolutional layers as samples from a multidimensional continuous random variable. Specifically, the feature channels $X = {X_1,X_2,...,X_i}$ produced by the convolutional processes are considered as instances of the random variable X, where i denotes the number of channels and d represents the dimensionality of each channel.\nThis probabilistic framework allows for the conceptualization of network outputs at each layer as continuous random variables X, with the specific outputs $X_i$ serving as the sampled data points. This perspective is"}, {"title": "Entropy Calculation", "content": "The challenge of estimating the entropy at each layer of a neural network boils down to evaluating the entropy based on the probability distribution of the unknown continuous random variable X.\nTo address this, we leverage the concept of differential entropy, which extends Shannon's classical definition of entropy to continuous probability distributions [17]. The differential entropy h(X) for a random variable X, with a probability density function f over its domain, is defined as:\n$h(X) = \\int f(x) \\log f (x) dx$\nHowever, without prior knowledge of the exact probability distribution, and with only a limited set of sample values available from this distribution, estimating f(x) directly is impractical. In such cases, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Entropy Estimation Method provides a viable alternative [32]. This method approximates the differential entropy by considering the spatial distribution of sample points within the data space.\nIn the KNN approach, each sample point is considered within a d-dimensional hypersphere, with the radius defined by the distance to the nearest neighbor. Assuming uniform distribution within this volume, the probability of each point can be approximated by 1/n, where n is the total number of samples. Yet, given the likely non-uniform distribution of data in practice, this method adjusts the estimated probability density based on local sample density, as follows:\n$p(x_i) = [(n - 1) \\cdot r_d(x_i)^d \\cdot V_d]^{-1}$\nHere, $r_d(x_i)$ is the Euclidean distance from the sample point $x_i$ to its nearest neighbor, and $V_d$ represents the volume of the unit sphere in d dimensions. The entropy estimate for the distribution is then calculated by summing the logarithmic probabilities adjusted by the Euler-Mascheroni constant \u03b3, approximately 0.5772:\n$H(X) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} [-log p(x_i)] + \\gamma$\nFor more robust estimation, this method can be extended to consider distances to the k-th nearest neighbor, enhancing the accuracy especially in sparse data regions:\n$H(X,k) = -\\psi(k) + \\psi(n) + log V_d + \\frac{d}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} log r_{d,k} (x_i)$\nHere, \u03c8 is the digamma function, and $r_{d,k}(x_i)$ indicates the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor. Notably, this refined entropy calculation, H(X, k), closely approximates H(X) when k = 1. We utilize this entropy measure, H(X), to derive the entropy change \u0394\u0397 across network layers, with $\u0394H_n = H_{n+1} - H_n$, where n is the layer index. This precise measurement of entropy changes allows for enhanced optimization of the network's information processing capabilities, ensuring efficient learning and data representation."}, {"title": "Loss Functions for Information Compression Network", "content": "In the realm of information compression networks, the overarching goal is to transmit data efficiently while minimizing redundancy and irrelevant information. To this end, we have developed two specific loss functions based on the expected behavior of the information transmission process within such networks. These functions, $L_1$ and $L_2$, are designed to optimize the network by focusing on the steadiness and directionality of information change, respectively.\nEntropy Variance Loss Function ($L_1$): This function is aimed at ensuring a stable change in entropy across the network layers. It measures the variance of the entropy changes \u0394\u0397 against their mean $\u0394\\bar{H}$, with an ideal variance of zero, indicating perfect stability:\n$L_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{N} (\u0394H_n - \u0394\\bar{H})^2}{N}$\nHere, N represents the total number of layers, and n is the index of each layer.

To illustrate the effect more intuitively, we analyzed the output of each layer of a model trained with and without the Entropy Loss function. Utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [1] to reduce dimensionality, we produced the visualizations shown in Figure 3. These images highlight the feature compression process, represented by the red and blue lines.\nIn scenarios without Entropy Loss, discerning a consistent pattern or rule in the distribution of output feature samples from each network layer proves challenging. This variability can lead to inefficiencies in learning and model generalization. Conversely, the integration of Entropy Loss stabilizes the transformation of data throughout the network layers, as evidenced by the more orderly and predictable distributions depicted in the figure. This stabilization suggests that Entropy Loss not only enhances the compressibility of features but also aligns them more closely with the underlying structure dictated by the target functions of the network.\nThese findings underscore the dual benefits of incorporating Entropy Loss into neural network training protocols.

While the detection accuracy for Cyclist and Pedestrian classes saw improvements exceeding 3%, a notable decrease occurred in Car detection accuracy. This trend becomes more pronounced in more complex configurations such as SECOND+ResNet+Correlation[36, 14, 38]+GNN[28]+FPN[22], where only the Pedestrian detection accuracy improved.\nThese findings suggest that the benefits of Entropy Loss are most pronounced in simpler network layers and become diluted as the model's complexity increases.

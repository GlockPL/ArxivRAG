This shift coincides with the progressive maturation of general Al technologies 18. Demonstrating stable performance, these technologies adeptly manage the voluminous and diverse information generated by millions of online users daily. Data from various sources, including official media, blogs, forums, and social networks, undergoes preliminary processing before sentiment analysis algorithms analyze it to deduce insights into positive and negative sentiments. In our highly interconnected world, the outcomes of such analyses significantly impact both workflows and corporate decision-making processes. For instance14, before launching new products, company decision-makers can utilize sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion during holidays, thereby forecasting potential online engagement, market reception, and sales projections.\nTo foster more objective sentiment analysis, as shown in Fig. 1, people employ web scraping, crowdsourcing, and APIs to amass vast quantities of data from online media. The multimodal nature of this data, encompassing video, audio, text, and numerical formats, presents considerable challenges and escalates the cost of feature extraction4. Nevertheless, the progressively stable advancements in Al technologies have markedly enhanced the accuracy of"}, {"title": "Emerging Trends in Collaborative Als", "content": "Fig. 2 summarizes the general methodology for generating public sentiment reports in an environment dominated by online media. Data from various types of online media can be processed and summarized by both non-LLM and LLM models, ultimately providing refined analytical results for decision-makers. Collaborative Al demonstrates superior capabilities in handling multi- threaded tasks or tasks with complex logic compared to a single LLM. Consequently, the emergence of various collaborative Al frameworks offers significant inspiration for the development of sentiment analysis systems:\nSimulate Social Interactions: Researchers like Joon Sung Park et al. 13 have successfully simulated credible human behavior by integrating large language models with computational interactive agents. They developed modules for daily scheduling, long-term memory, reflection, and reasoning to enable LLM-based agents to mimic human behavioral patterns. The simulation"}, {"title": "Enhance Performance", "content": "Collaborative Al demonstrates strong adaptability in optimizing tasks that require complex logic. For instance, in software development, which typically involves design, coding, testing, and documentation phases, Chen Qian et al.15 proposed specialized roles for programmers, reviewers, and testing engineers. Their system, CHATDEV, conducts multi- ple rounds of code construction and testing, ultimately producing user manuals with fewer flaws than those generated by general GAI models. This collaborative approach has been shown to address potential flaws and errors efficiently and cost-effectively, which is particularly important as user requirements often lead to inaccuracies in LLM-generated code."}, {"title": "Facilitate Human-Machine Collaboration", "content": "The potential of human-machine collaboration, another facet of collaborative Al, is also noteworthy. In response to human behaviors, re- searchers like Ran Gong et al.5 incorporated LLMs (such as GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA) into the scenario game CUISINEWORLD, achieving complex task scheduling. Their multi-agent planning framework, comprising scene, memory, and action modules, inputs rules, scene information, and roles into LLMs to generate corresponding action plans. This approach yields more reasonable suggestions by understanding human intentions, facilitating efficient operations under human guidance, and significantly reducing communication costs."}, {"title": "Navigate Adversarial Interaction", "content": "In studies conducted by Kai Xiong 16, debates among groups of agents with varying capabilities revealed that LLMs exhibit different levels of self- consistency and compromise based on their performance.

Based on the query, the system assigns a crawler Al to collect information from designated portals and integrates this data into a database. After the database Al processes the timestamp data, a report-writing Al generates the report. Given the questionable reliability of LLM-generated information, all arguments collected by Al are cited with sources (with an option to hide or display URLs), ensuring that the final report generated by the collaborative Al maintains interpretability and contextual logic at every stage, thereby presenting a compelling and persuasive conclusion for users to consider."}, {"title": "Analysis Objects", "content": "When users do not specify, the system defaults to gathering information from official and social media sources, considering all mined content for the final report. Regional media preferences and habits dictate the default mainstream media channels for sentiment data collection, such as Yahoo in Japan, Google in English-speaking regions, and Baidu in China.

This report encompasses detailed summaries, in-depth analyses, and specific word- related data. It is structured to ensure a reading time of no more than 10 minutes, enabling decision-makers to assimilate essential information rapidly. A standardized report format has been adopted to minimize reading time. This format leverages Language Model (LLM) prompt- based outputs to create specific sections. The composition of a typical report (termed the Report Writing Agent) incorporates three key segments: Summarizing Outputs (comprising an intro- duction, a summary, and a conclusion), Analytical Outputs (encompassing cause analysis, risk assessment, policy recommendations, and associated word analysis), and Graphical Out- puts (translating data into visual representations). The LLM generates preliminary content for these eight sections based on structured prompts. Subsequently, this content is meticulously reorganized to align with the predefined standard text format before being archived. The founda- tional texts for these standards are derived from outputs generated by our crawler agent. These texts are then progressively augmented by various Al systems, each responsible for a specific function, culminating in the assembly of the final report. The tasks executed by individual Al components rely on pre-existing data and do not entail autonomous generation, ensuring that the accuracy of the analytical outputs remains both explainable and traceable.

As illustrated in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, after retrieving local crawler documents, the LLM-based sentiment report can be completed in just 25 seconds. With an 4,000-words input, the performance of gpt-4o-mini and gemini-1.5-flash is already satisfactory and offers better cost-effectiveness compared to larger models in the same series (gpt-4-turbo and gemini- 1.5-pro).\nSentiment accuracy is invested by a dataset of more than 3,400 comments\u00b9 and the sen- timent analysis performance is validated (positive or negative). Fig. 6c indicates that various commercial LLMs meet general sentiment analysis accuracy standards (94%-96%), although contradictions arise in cases where textual evaluations are positive yet receive low ratings.\nEdge deployment approach utilizes lightweight large language models, enhancing reason- ing capabilities for specific tasks while preserving privacy. Deployment of these large models requires only a simple PC or personal workstation. As shown in Fig. 6d, we introduce several language models suitable for local deployment, including the continuously developed ChatGLM2, InternLM, LLaMA2, StableBeluga2, and Qwend. We monitor runtime performance under cold starts (including preload) and warm starts (after preload). For a near 4,000-word input, the per- plexity below 400 is acceptable. Users prioritizing privacy protection select appropriately sized large models for local deployment based on SLA (service level agreement)."}, {"title": "LLM based Sentiment Analysis", "content": "In applying our collaborative Al system, we concentrated on analyzing the sentiment surrounding \"takeout\u201d across diverse media channels.

We employ mainstream, stable methodologies accessible via LLM's API for quantifiable emotion assessment and prediction.\nAssessment Algorithm: We integrat TextBlob, a versatile tool combining various NLP func- tionalities such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and noun phrase extraction to facilitate robust and universal emotion analysis. TextBlob's accessibility enables developers to implement it efficiently without needing extensive NLP expertise. Its computational efficiency and modular nature are particularly advantageous for handling large data volumes in collabora- tive Al systems. We utilize TextBlob to compute two key emotional indicators: Polarity (ranging from -1 for negative to 1 for positive sentiment) and Subjectivity (from 0 for objectivity to 1 for subjectivity). Inspired by human semantic analysis7, These metrics together establish a com- prehensive sentiment analysis framework. Our methodology involves a weighted combination of these scores:\nScore = wp \u00b7 Polarity + w\u300f \u00b7 Subjectivity   (1)\nwhere wp and w\u300f represent the weights for Polarity and Subjectivity, respectively.\nAdjusting these weights allows for tailored analysis relative to specific keywords, such as prioritizing Polarity for consumer goods and Subjectivity for tools and policies. Other assess- ment tools are also viable options in specific application scenarios. For instance, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) offers a broader range of natural language processing capabilities, suitable for more complex text analysis tasks. Stanford NLP and spaCy are powerful NLP tools with differences in accuracy and performance, suitable for advanced language processing needs. Furthermore, Google Cloud Natural Language API, as a commercial service, provides large- scale and highly customizable text analysis capabilities. In designing collaborative Al systems, different tools help us more effectively achieve specific goals.\nPrediction Algorithms: When sufficient assessment data aggregates into a time series, we incorporate prediction algorithms to forecast future emotional trends. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a quintessential Al technique within Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), is particularly adept at handling long sequence predictions. When the scale and complexity of the data reach significant levels, RNN-based networks are preferable for achieving precise forecasts\u00b2. Consequently, we utilize methods optimized for time series prediction with minimal data requirements:\n\u2022 Moving Average (MA): An elementary technique ideal for illustrating trends and smoothing data fluctuations.\n\u2022 Auto Regression (AR) Model: Suitable for capturing autocorrelation in datasets.\n\u2022 Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA): A sophisticated model that merges autoregression and moving average attributes, effectively applied to non-seasonal data.\nFor these models, typically, only the daily sentiment scores from the past few days (such as av- erage Polarity and Subjectivity) are necessary to compute relatively accurate predictions based on historical trends."}]}

Many researchers within the field of affective computing are adopting deep learning technology to explore potential patterns related to the detection of depression. However, because of subjects' privacy protection concerns, that data in this area is still scarce, presenting a challenge for the deep discriminative models used in detecting depression. To navigate these obstacles, a large-scale multimodal vlog dataset (LMVD), for depression recognition in the wild is built. In LMVD, which has 1823 samples with 214 hours of the 1475 participants captured from four multimedia platforms (Sina Weibo, Bilibili, Tiktok, and YouTube). A novel architecture termed MDDformer to learn the non-verbal behaviors of individuals is proposed. Extensive validations are performed on the LMVD dataset, demonstrating superior performance for depression detection. We anticipate that the LMVD will contribute a valuable function to the depression detection community.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "MAJOR depression disorder (MDD) has been projected to a primary mental illness by 2030. A comprehensive survey and meta-analysis unveiled that from a study of 41,531 individuals, 33.7% of them experienced depression during the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. Normally, depression can affect various aspects of daily activities, including the progress of one's careers, studies, and families, etc [2]. In some severe cases, individuals suffering from depression may contemplate or attempt suicide [3]. In spite of the many attempts to identify depression, recent findings suggest that the prevalence of depression may be increasing in the younger individuals group.\nDepressed subjects often express several different non-verbal behaviors, e.g., facial expressions, body gestures, and smile. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) outlines symptoms such as agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, and hand-wringing) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech and body movements and increased pauses before answering) that may be displayed by depressed subjects. Current approaches of treating depression are mainly based on assessment by clinicians or the description of depressed subjects, both of which may be subjective. With the fast advancement of computer vision methods, a list of methods are explored to study the depression severity. Present methods of recognising depression can be considered as hand-crafted [4]\u2013[7] and deep learning-based [8]\u2013[12] approaches. From the modality perspective, methods for depression recognition can be classified into audiovisual cues, social media data (Weibo, Twitter), and physiological and non-physiological signals [13] such as skin conductance, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electrocardiography (ECG), heart sounds, respiration, and pulse signals. Despite promising performances achieved by current depression recognition methods, several challenges remain in effectively recognizing depression via multimodal signals. This is especially prevalent in the field of deep learning community, where a substantial quantity of data samples is necessary to train the available models. By reviewing the depression databases from recent decades [2], one observes small samples of publicly accessible data because of privacy protection. Furthermore, most of the available databases are collected in controlled laboratory environments via doctor-patient interactions; therefore behavioral patterns of the depressed subjects outside of the laboratory environment are missed [14]. Although, Yoon et al. [15] introduced a D-vlog depression dataset containing 961 samples and providing facial landmarks and low level descriptors (LLDs).\nHence, to mitigate the above-mentioned major issues, a large-scale multimodal vlog database (LMVD) is built. In general, these vlogs are recorded and uploaded spontaneously by users, which motivate us to release this novel dataset to capture the potential patterns embedded in the vlogs of individuals navigating their daily lives. First, we obtain the"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "In this section, we offer a detailed explanation of the collected dataset and its relevance to multimodal depression detection by reviewing related works."}, {"title": "A. The Depression Dataset", "content": "Because of the privacy protection related to studies on depression, data collection is very complicated. Consequently, various research teams have endeavored to record their own databases for depression estimation. This section examines a total of 21 databases, with only nine being accessible to the public.\nBased on Table I, the following observations are considered:\n1) Data Accessibility: Eight databases on depression de-tection are publicly available. However, most of the databases provide the extracted hand-crafted and deep-learning features, without providing the raw audio and video signals. Most importantly, our collected dataset has more samples for multimodal depression detection among individuals navigating their daily lives.\n2) Sample Size: In terms of the number of data samples,one can see that only the D-vlog [15] holds the previous record with 961 samples. LMVD boasts a significantly larger collection of 1,823 samples (214 hours) from 1,475 participants. However, the databases AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 are the most frequently used by researchers, although AVEC2014 only contains 292 subjects with 300 samples.\n3) Geographic Diversity: Most of the databases are locatedin the EU, with only two collected in China. Based on the concepts of depression, the depressed subjects represent different behaviors in different countries.\n4) Modality Coverage: Most of the datasets contain audioand video modalities, while only a few contain the text modality for depression detection. Similar to existing datasets, LMVD primarily focuses on audio and video modalities. However, it offers a wider range of visual features compared to some existing datasets, including FAUs, landmarks, eye gaze, and head pose features, which can provide richer insights. As indicated in Table I, 12 databases only have unimodal, and 50% of them have the audio modality, because this metric is easily recorded. There are only eight (45%) multimodal databases available.\nOverall, LMVD offers several advantages for researchers in the field of multimodal depression detection. Its larger sample size, diverse participant pool, raw data access, and broader range of features make it a valuable resource for advancing research efforts."}, {"title": "B. Multimodal Depression Detection", "content": "A series of studies, which utilize cues from audio, video, and text modalities, have been suggested to accurately evaluate the status of depression. Lam et al. [35] leverage topic modelling strategy to augment the size of the data and combine the power of a transformer mechanism with a 1D-CNN (1 dimension convolutional neural networks) to capture the patterns from acoustic features. Niu et al. [36] adopt combined spatio-temporal attention (STA) and multimodal attention feature fusion (MAFF) network for modeling the multimodal features. In a later study [37], Ni et al. designed a hierarchical context-aware graph (HCAG) attention model that reflects layered information for the assessment of depression and employed a graph attention network (GAT) to discern contextual connections within the text/audio modalities. In the work of [38], a graph neural network-based semi-supervised domain adaptation (GNN-SDA) technique is presented to address the challenges associated with limited sample sizes and isolated data clusters. Pan et al. [39] present an audiovisual attention architecture named AVA-DepressNet, which focuses on privacy protection concern and an embedded attention-driven module for identifying depression. Moreover, an adversarial multi-stage (AMS) approach is formulated for refining the encoder-decoder framework, integrating knowledge of facial structures. In 2024, a transformer-based structure was introduced from the video, audio, and remote photoplethysmographic (rPPG) cues for multimodal prediction of depression [40]."}, {"title": "III.

Data Collection", "content": "Our goal is to build a large-scale dataset for multimodal depression detection in individuals navigating their daily lives. To achieve this, we aim to collect depression and non-depression vlogs from different platforms with similar content distribution. Therefore, we collect the vlog videos from three Chinese multimedia platforms (Sina Weibo, Bilibili, and Tiktok). Data was collected from 1st Jan 2019 to 30th October 2023 using the following keywords (in Chinese):\n1) Depressed category: depression, my depressed life, and depressed vlog.\n2) Non-depressed category: daily Life, daily vlog, my vlog.\nIn addition to the Chinese platforms, we collect vlogs from YouTube using the same keywords in the same period. The collection process followed a similar approach. By collecting data from both Chinese and English platforms, we aimed to enhance the diversity and generalized ability of the LMVD dataset.\nAs shown in Table II, the two platforms have balanced samples except for Sina Weibo. This is because many users adopt Sina Weibo to post text messages about their feelings,"}, {"title": "C. Data Annotation", "content": "To perform the annotation for the depression and health vlogs, four master and ten undergraduate students are recruited. First, we ask the ten undergraduate students to check whether the vlogs have faces and if the audio is synthesized. As shown in Table III, we obtained 1823 data samples for the LMVD. For the Depressed and Non-depressed categories, the number of vlogs is 908 and 915, respectively. Secondly, we ask the four master's students to recheck the vlogs to ensure the quality is sufficient for training the deep models for multimodal depression detection. Then we assign the 1823 vlogs to the ten undergraduate students who assigned them to either the Depressed or Non-depressed categories. Finally, the master students check the labels assigned by the undergraduate students.\nTable IV shows the duration of vlogs from different platforms. Bilibili exhibits the most significantly higher time spent between the Depressed and Non-depressed category. As a matter of fact, it shows the highest disparity between the two categories among all listed platforms. TikTok shows less time spent in both categories compared to Bilibili, but still has a considerable amount of time spent by users on the platform. The ratio of time spent between Depressed and Non-depressed is less than Bilibili, indicating a more balanced usage among"}, {"title": "D. Multimodal Feature Extraction", "content": "To establish a foundational benchmark for the field of depression recognition, we employ the primary features commonly used.\nFor audio features, the pre-trained VGGish [41] model is adopted. This is because the traditional hand-crafted features have the following limitations: (1) professional knowledge is often needed to design the discriminative features, and (2) additional valuable patterns may be lost in developing the deep features.\nFor visual features, FAU, facial landmarks, eye gaze, and head pose features are adopted.\n1) Facial Action Units (FAUs): We focus on a subset of 17 AUs (AU01, AU02, AU04, AU45) that have been linked to emotional expression. These features represent specific muscle movements in the face that can provide insights into a person's emotional state.\n2) Facial Landmarks: We extract facial landmarks (see Fig. 1) to represent the key points of the participant's facial structure. Facial landmarks are robust for capturing facial muscle movements, making them valuable features for tasks like emotion analysis, depression detection, and facial action unit detection."}, {"title": "IV.

Then, the CFformer can adopt the advantages of cross fusion for learning behaviors from the audiovisual cues. Finally, two fully connected layers and the softmax function are performed to predicting the depression."}, {"title": "B. Multimodal Depression Detection", "content": "1) Baseline Model: Over the past decades, deep learning methods have gathered significant attention across various tasks. Consequently, to establish a benchmark in the field of depression detection, we adopt both traditional machine learning methods and several deep learning techniques. Specifically, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [42] is employed to address two category problems, serving as the baseline model for multimodal depression detection. More information on KNN can be found in [42].\n2) Structure of MDDformer: To effectively detect the discriminative patterns within audiovisual cues, MDDformer is proposed. Let's define the audio feature as $X^{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D_{a}}$, and the video feature as $X^{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D_{v}}$ before inputting into the MDDformer. Here, $D_{a}$ represents the dimension of audio, $D_{v}$ represents the dimension of video, and N denotes the length of sequences.\nInitially, the transformer architecture [43] is proposed to model therelationships in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, which consists of an encoder-decoder structure. Both the encoder and decoder are composed of multiple identical layers, each containing two main sub-modules,i.e., multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks. In our task, to fuse the patterns from audio and video branch, an MDDformer is proposed.\nThe input audio feature $X^{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D_{a}}$ is mapped to three matrices by three linear transformations, i.e., key $K_{a}$, query $Q_{a}$, and value $V_{a}$.\n$Q_{a} = X^{a}W^{Q_{a}}$, $K_{a} = X^{a}W^{K_{a}}$,$V_{a} = X^{a}W^{Va}$ (1)\nwhere $W^{Qa}$, $W^{Ka}$, and $W^{va}$ denotes the weights of linear transformation. The video feature $X^{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D_{v}}$ can be mapped to three matrices by three linear transformations, i.e., key $K_{v}$, query $Q_{v}$, value $V_{v}$.\n$Q_{v} = X^{v}W^{Q_{v}}$, $K_{v} = X^{v}W^{K_{v}}$, $V_{v} = X^{v}W^{V_{v}}$ (2)\nwhere $W^{Q_{v}}$, $W^{K_{v}}$, and $W^{V_{v}}$ denotes the weights of linear transformation.\nNext, $Q_{a}$ is multiplied with $K_{a}^{T}$ to generate the feature $F_{a} = Q_{a}K_{a}^{T}$ and $Q_{v}$ multiplied with $K_{v}^{T}$ to generate the feature $F_{v} = Q_{v}K_{v}^{T}$. Then we concatenate $F_{v}$ and $F_{a}$ to generate the feature map, i.e., $F_{av}$:\n$F_{av} = concat(F_{a}, F_{v})$ (3)\nThe self attention of the audio branch can be expressed as:\n$Attention\\_a (Q_{a}, K_{a}, V_{a}) = softmax(\\frac{F_{av}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V_{a}$ (4)\nwhere $d_{k}$ is the dimension of the $F_{av}$ matrix.\nThe self attention of the visual branch can be expressed as:\n$Attention\\_v (Q_{v}, K_{v}, V_{v}) = softmax(\\frac{F_{av}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V_{v}$ (5)\nwhere $d_{k}$ is the dimension of the $F_{av}$ matrices.\nThen, we concatenate the outputs of each head and reshape them to add with the feature $X^{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times D_{a}}$,generating the fusion feature.\n$F_{f}=Concat((Concat ( head_{1a}, head_{2a},...,head_{ha})W_{a} +X^{a})+(Concat ( head_{1v}, head_{2v},..., head_{hv})W_{v} + X^{v}))$ (6)\nwhere $h$ is the heads of the multi-head self-attention and $W_{a}$ and $W_{v}$ are weight matrices.\nFollowing the concatenate operation, $F_{f}$ is then input to the feed-forward network, adopting the add/norm operation to generate the feature $F_{n}$:\n$F_{n} = Norm(FFN(F_{f}) + F_{f})$ (7)\nwhere Norm is the normalization operation."}, {"title": "B. Evaluation Metrics", "content": "In general, the classification performance is mainly evaluated using five metrics for binary classification problems: accuracy, precision, recall (also known as sensitivity), specificity, and F1-score. Here, true positive (TP) indicates samples with positive labels that are correctly predicted as positive. Similarly, true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) respectively represent samples correctly predicted as negative, incorrectly predicted as positive, and incorrectly predicted as negative, respectively. The formula can be expressed as:\n$Accuracy = \\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$ (10)\n$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ (11)\n$Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$ (12)\n$F1 score = 2 \u00d7 $\\frac{Precision \u00d7 Recall}{Precision + Recall}$ (13)"}, {"title": "V.

{"title": "Emoji Retrieval from Gibberish or Garbled Social Media Text: A Novel Methodology and A Case Study", "authors": ["Shuqi Cui", "Nirmalya Thakur", "Audrey Poon"], "abstract": "Emojis, considered an integral aspect of social media conversations, are widely used on almost all social media platforms. However, social media data may be noisy and may also include gibberish or garbled text which is difficult to detect and work with. Most na\u00efve data preprocessing approaches recommend removing such gibberish or garbled text from social media posts before performing any form of data analysis or before passing such data to any machine learning model. However, it is important to note that such gibberish or garbled text may have been an emoji(s) in the original social media post(s) and failure to retrieve the actual emoji(s) may result in the loss or lack of contextual meaning of the analyzed social media data. The work presented in this paper aims to address this challenge by proposing a three-step reverse engineering-based novel methodology for retrieving emojis from garbled or gibberish text in social media posts. The development of this methodology also helped to unravel the reasons that could lead to the generation of gibberish or garbled text related to data mining of social media posts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the model was applied to a dataset of 509,248 Tweets about the Mpox outbreak, that has been used in about 30 prior works in this field, none of which were able to retrieve the emojis in the original Tweets from the gibberish text present in this dataset. Using our methodology, we were able to retrieve a total of 157,748 emojis present in 76,914 Tweets in this dataset by processing the gibberish or garbled text. The effectiveness of this methodology has been discussed in the paper through the presentation of multiple metrics related to text readability and text coherence which include the Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch Kincaid Grade Score, Coleman Liau index, Automated Readability Index, Dale Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time for the Tweets before and after the application of the methodology to the Tweets. The results showed that the application of this methodology to the Tweets improved the readability and coherence scores. Finally, as a case study, the frequency of emoji usage in these Tweets about the Mpox outbreak was analyzed and the results are presented.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

[20] showed that data gathered from live-streamingplatforms frequently involves emojis, emotes, and emoticons, and understanding theusage of the same is vital in comprehending the discussions on live-streaming plat-forms. Kumar et al. [21] utilized machine learning and deep learning algorithms topredict emojis in text-based data where the emojis were not mined correctly or weremissing. Nusrat et al. [22] used Bert to predict the most appropriate emoji for a giventext. Their model achieved an overall accuracy of 75% and was more accurate ascompared to other emoji prediction models at that time. The work of Kone et al. [23]concluded that emojis are a \u201cvisual language\" that enables users to communicate theirfeelings. Ranjan et al. [24] studied the relationship between English words and emojisto predict the latter. They trained their model using concepts of Multinomial NaiveBayes and LSTMs to predict emojis in Tweets. Stoikos et al. [25] utilized a BERT-moticon model to predict missing emojis in social media texts. They applied the mod-el to Tweets about COVID-19. The findings of their work showed that since WHO'sdeclaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, there has been a spike in the usage ofemojis on social media platforms, specifically emojis that are associated with feelingsof sadness. Inan et al. [26] used concepts of classification from machine learning topredict emojis in Tweets. They tested their model on a dataset of Tweets and theirapproach achieved a 0.901 F1 score.

Results and Discussions", "content": "This section presents the results of this research work. To show the effectiveness ofthe proposed three-step reverse engineering-based novel methodology for retrievingemojis from garbled or gibberish text in social media posts, we have presented Table3. In Table 3, we revisit Table 1 and show the processing of those Tweets using ourmethodology that results in the retrieval of all the emojis (from the gibberish or gar-bled text) as were present in these original Tweets on Twitter.\nIn a similar way, using this methodology we were able to retrieve all the emojisfrom the garbled or gibberish text in this dataset. There were a total of 76914 Tweetscontaining garbled or gibberish text and upon passing the same through our method-ology we were able to retrieve the actual emojis that were used in these Tweets. Atotal of 157748 emojis were retrieved during this process. We evaluated the effective-ness of the application of this methodology to this dataset using multiple metrics re-lated to text readability and text coherence which include the Flesch Reading Ease,Flesch Kincaid Grade Score, Coleman Liau index, Automated Readability Index,Dale Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time for the Tweets beforeand after the application of the methodology. Twitter allows a user to publish a Tweetcontaining up to 280 characters and users may or may not use all the characters. Infact, studies have shown that depending on the subject matter users on Twitter maypost short or long Tweets [64,65]. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the perfor-mance of our methodology on Tweets of different lengths (in terms of the number ofcharacters). So, we grouped the Tweets in this dataset into four groups as outlinedbelow:\n\u2022 Group 1 = length of Tweets less than or equal to 70 characters\n\u2022 Group 2 = length of Tweets greater than or equal to 71 characters but less than 141characters\n\u2022 Group 3 = length of Tweets greater than or equal to 141 characters but less than211 characters\n\u2022 Group 4 = length of Tweets greater than 211 characters\nFigure 2 shows the evaluation of these metrics for all these groups before applyingour methodology and Figure 3 shows the evaluation of these metrics for all thesegroups after applying our methodology.\nThe improvement of most of these metrics upon the application of our methodolo-gy indicates the effectiveness of the same related to text readability and coherence.For instance, for Group 1, the average Automated Readability Index improved from9.41 to 6.15. The average Automated Readability Index is a number that approximatesthe grade level needed to comprehend a given text. In other words, for this metric, alower score indicates better readability. Similarly, for Group 1, the average Dale ChallReadability Score changed from 14.21 to 10.59. The reading time for Group 1, Group"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "Emojis, an essential component of social media posts, are extensively used on al-most all social media platforms. However, social media data is prone to noise, andprior works in this area have also acknowledged the presence of gibberish text insocial media posts, that is difficult to identify and work with. In the recent past, mul-tiple studies have focused on identifying and predicting the presence of emojis insocial media posts containing gibberish text. However, those algorithms are not high-ly accurate as those algorithms do not investigate or identify the root cause for thegeneration of gibberish text in the mined version of the social media posts. Therefore,the emojis generated by these algorithms may not consistently align with the intendedmeaning of an analyzed social media post(s). Furthermore, emojis play a vital role inthe development of various Natural Language Processing algorithms. Conventionaldata preprocessing approaches often advise the deletion of such gibberish or garbledtext from social media posts, such as Tweets, prior to performing any data analysis orproviding such posts as input to a machine learning model. In this context, it is crucialto note that such gibberish or garbled text may contain meaningful information, suchemojis, which would be lost if simply deleted.\nThe work presented in this paper aims to address this challenge by proposing athree-step reverse engineering-based novel methodology for retrieving emojis fromgarbled or gibberish text in social media posts.

Accurate positioning is indispensable for enabling the effective operation of systems and enhancing user experiences in applications such as intelligent transportation, emergency response, logistics tracking, and extended reality (XR). By providing precise location information, wireless positioning enables more efficient resource management, accurate service delivery, and enhanced security.\nWireless positioning, beyond its communication capabilities, represents a vital application of wireless networks, making its research and performance improvements of significant importance. In outdoor environments, cellular positioning and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technologies play pivotal roles, providing essential support for pedestrian navigation, autonomous driving, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization [1]. These technologies not only enhance positioning accuracy but also improve user experience and safety. Indoors, advancements in technologies such as cellular networks, WiFi, Bluetooth, and ultra-wideband (UWB) have enabled precise localization within complex environments, which is crucial for applications like shopping mall navigation and emergency evacuation [2]. As part of mobile communication infrastructure, cellular positioning is instrumental in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. However, traditional positioning methods, primarily based on geometric relationships like triangulation and trilateration, still face challenges in terms of accuracy, robustness, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic environments.\nIn recent years, the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought transformative changes to wireless positioning [3].

Furthermore, AI-driven systems can adapt to changing environments by learning from historical data, offering innovative solutions to the challenges of traditional techniques. As AI continues to advance, AI-driven wireless positioning is expected to play an increasingly critical role in the future.\nNevertheless, AI-driven wireless positioning also faces several challenges. First, AI algorithms require substantial amounts of data for training, and obtaining high-quality training data in the wireless positioning domain is often difficult. Additionally, wireless signals are influenced by various factors, such as buildings and weather conditions, line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario, which pose challenges to the generalization capabilities of AI algorithms. Moreover, the computational complexity of AI algorithms limits their application in resource-constrained devices. Therefore, designing lightweight, efficient AI algorithms and leveraging limited data resources for effective training are crucial research areas in wireless positioning.\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI-driven wireless positioning, encompassing the fundamentals of AI and wireless technologies, progress in standardization, state-of-the-art developments, and associated challenges and research opportunities.

Related Work", "content": "Wireless positioning has been a widely researched topic, with extensive investigations focusing on a variety of techniques, scenarios, and applications. Below, we provide a detailed overview of existing surveys and explain how this paper, with its focus on AI-driven wireless positioning, distinguishes itself.\nTo address the challenges posed by wireless signal positioning, researchers have conducted numerous studies on the fundamental theories of positioning. Focusing on localization algorithms, the authors in [4] provide a comprehensive survey of time-of-arrival (TOA)-based localization algorithms. In [2], the authors summarize indoor positioning algorithms and discuss systems based on WiFi, radio frequency identification (RFID), UWB, Bluetooth, and other technologies.

FUNDAMENTALS OF AI TECHNOLOGY", "content": "Advanced AI models and algorithms play a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven wireless positioning systems. In this section, we will provide a review of classic AI models and algorithms."}, {"title": "A. Overview of AI Models", "content": "In the realm of AI, neural network architectures play a pivotal role in enabling machines to learn from data and make predictions or classifications. This subsection introduces four mainstream neural network models commonly applied in AI-driven wireless positioning systems: fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. The architecture of these models are shown in Fig. 2.\n1) FCNNs: FCNNs are the basic building blocks of deep learning. In an FCNN, every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer, creating a fully connected architecture [3], [22], [23]. In an FCNN layer with m input neurons and n output neurons, each output neuron is represented as a weighted sum of all neurons from the preceding layer.\nFCNNs can be employed to tackle regression, prediction, and classification tasks. When disregarding computational performance constraints, configuring deeper network models often leads to better performance. However, being a linear neural network, FCNNs inevitably encounter issues with poor accuracy when dealing with nonlinear datasets. Consequently, subsequent efforts have often focused on augmenting the nonlinear characteristics of neural networks.\n2) CNNs: CNNs are a type of feedforward neural network featuring convolutional operations and deep structures. They are widely used in image processing [24], [25], speech recognition [26], [27], and natural language processing [28]. As shown in Fig. 2b, in a CNN, the convolution operation applies a set of shared weights (convolution kernels) to an input feature map to produce an output feature map.\nCNNs excel at extracting local features through their convolutional layers, leveraging translation invariance to ensure efficient and accurate feature representation. Compared to FCNNs, CNNs reduce the number of parameters by sharing weights across spatial locations, making them computationally efficient for high-dimensional data [29]. However, due to their focus on local regions, CNNs inherently struggle to model global relationships, particularly at a fine-grained level. This limitation has led to the integration of complementary techniques, such as attention mechanisms or global pooling layers, to enhance their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n3) LSTMS: CNNs are effective for spatial modeling but are limited in capturing temporal dependencies. To address this, LSTM networks [30], [31], a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are designed to model sequential data by introducing gate mechanisms to regulate information flow. The schematic diagram of an LSTM is shown in Fig. 2c. An LSTM processes input sequences using mechanisms such as the forget gate to discard irrelevant past information, the input gate to incorporate new data, and the output gate to produce meaningful hidden states.\nThese features enable LSTMs to retain essential long-term dependencies while adapting to new input dynamically. However, their recurrent nature and additional parameters make them computationally intensive compared to simpler feedforward networks. Beyond LSTM, other neural network models like gated recurrent unit (GRU) [32], Bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) [33], temporal convolutional network (TCN) [34], and Transformers [35] have been extensively used for time series tasks. GRU offers efficiency with fewer parameters, while BiRNN captures bidirectional dependencies. TCN achieves scalable performance by replacing recurrence with causal convolutions. Transformers leverage attention mechanisms to model long-term dependencies and are increasingly popular for time series applications.\n4) Transformer: Transformers are groundbreaking neural network architectures built entirely on the attention mechanism, which have revolutionized AI across multiple domains [35]. Their unified encoder-decoder structure and multimodal capabilities make them highly versatile and adaptable. As shown in Fig. 2d, the Transformer is mainly composed of Ne cascaded encoders and Na cascaded decoders. The core of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, which assigns dynamic weights to different parts of the input sequence, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features [36]. Transformers streamline feature processing with a unified architecture, but their $O(n^2)$ computational complexity for attention mechanisms imposes high resource requirements, particularly for long sequences [37]. Moreover, the reliance of Transformers on large datasets for training can limit their efficiency on smaller datasets or simpler tasks, where models like CNNs may perform better."}, {"title": "B. Overview of AI Algorithms", "content": "In this subsection, we will introduce the AI algorithms commonly used in wireless AI positioning, including transfer learning, continual learning, few-shot learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). The schematic diagram of each algorithm is shown in Fig. 3.\n1) Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is an AI technique that utilizes knowledge from a source domain or task to enhance learning in a target domain or task [38], [39]. This method is effective when labeled data in the target domain is limited or costly to acquire, while sufficient data or pre-trained models are available in a related source domain. As shown in Fig. 3a, transfer learning achieves this by reusing representations from pre-trained models and adapting them to new tasks through two main steps. First, in the pre-training phase, the pre-trained model acts as a feature extractor, capturing transferable patterns from the source task. During the fine-tuning phase, the model is further trained on the target domain data, aligning it with the specific requirements of the new task by adjusting part or all of its parameters. This process enables AI models to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, significantly improving performance, especially when labeled data in the target domain is limited [39].\nTransfer learning has shown great promise in wireless positioning, where collecting labeled real-world data is often challenging. For instance, knowledge from simulated datasets can be transferred to real-world scenarios, significantly reducing the need for extensive labeled data while improving system performance [40]\u2013[42]. Similarly, a model trained on data from one floor of a building can be adapted to other floors, thereby lowering deployment costs. Furthermore, transfer learning can address challenges in cross-band and cross-protocol deployments, enabling models to generalize across different frequency bands or wireless communication protocols. However, the effectiveness of transfer learning in wireless positioning is closely tied to the similarity between the source and target domains. A significant discrepancy between the two domains can reduce transfer learning's effectiveness, while a small target dataset may lead to overfitting during fine-tuning.\n2) Continual Learning: Continual learning [43], [44], also known as lifelong learning [45] or incremental learning [46], [47], refers to the capability of AI models to continuously learn and accumulate knowledge from past tasks, facilitating adaptation to new and emerging tasks. The schematic diagram of the continual learning algorithm is shown in Fig. 3b. This process mimics human learning by building and retaining an evolving body of knowledge, ensuring that previously learned information is not forgotten when encountering new tasks. While continual learning shares similarities with transfer learning in leveraging prior knowledge, its objective is distinct: continual learning emphasizes long-term knowledge accumulation, whereas transfer learning focuses on optimizing a specific target task without considering long-term retention.\nContinual learning is essential in wireless positioning systems, which operate in dynamic environments and constantly evolving deployment scenarios. For instance, continual learning enables positioning models to adapt to new wireless network configurations or expanded coverage areas without losing effectiveness in previously trained conditions [48]. It also addresses challenges such as adapting to evolving wireless standards, new frequency bands, changing signal propagation conditions, and hardware upgrades. Despite its potential, continual learning faces challenges, including the risk of overfitting to new tasks when data is limited and the computational overhead associated with regularization or replay-based approaches. Developing efficient and scalable continual learning methods remains a critical area for advancing wireless positioning systems.\n3) Few-Shot Learning: As shown in Fig. 3c, few-shot learning aims to train effective models using a limited number of samples [49], [50]. This approach reduces the dependency on large datasets, significantly lowering the cost of data annotation and collection while maintaining competitive model performance. In scenarios where acquiring sufficient labeled data is challenging, Few-shot learning offers a promising solution by leveraging innovative learning paradigms to extract meaningful insights from sparse data. Few-shot learning models can be broadly categorized into three types: model-based, metric-based, and optimization-based approaches [49], [50].\nFew-shot learning is also important for wireless positioning systems, where labeled data is often scarce, and data collection is costly. For example, it can train models for positioning in new environments or deployment configurations using minimal labeled data. However, several challenges remain. The success of Few-shot learning depends heavily on the quality and representativeness of the support set used during training. In highly diverse or complex wireless environments, identifying representative samples can be difficult. Moreover, the limited number of samples can make Few-shot learning susceptible to overfitting, especially in noisy or heterogeneous datasets. Addressing these challenges requires careful design of learning paradigms and effective strategies for generalization and robustness in wireless positioning applications.\n4) Generative Adversarial Networks: As shown in Fig. 3d, GANs comprise two primary components: a Generator and a Discriminator. These two components engage in a competitive learning process where the Generator strives to produce data that closely resembles real data, while the Discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated data. This adversarial training framework enables both models to iteratively improve their performance [51], [52].\nIn wireless systems, GANs are a powerful tool for data augmentation and system optimization. Their capability to generate synthetic data resembling real-world conditions is particularly beneficial in scenarios where collecting real data is expensive or logistically challenging. For example, GANs can synthesize wireless channel data under varying environmental conditions, enabling the training of robust AI models for positioning without requiring extensive real-world data collection. Moreover, GANs can assist in addressing class imbalance issues and enhancing the diversity of training datasets, thereby improving model generalization and reliability.\n5) Other Advanced Al Techniques: Beyond the AI algorithms discussed, advanced techniques such as knowledge distillation [53], ensemble learning [54], and self-supervised learning [55] offer additional avenues to enhance wireless positioning systems. For example, knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student), improving inference speed and scalability while maintaining high accuracy. By combining predictions from multiple models, ensemble learning improves robustness and accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous environments. Self-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data by generating pseudo-labels through pretext tasks, reducing the reliance on labeled datasets and enabling models to learn effective feature representations.\nAs AI technologies continue to evolve, these advanced techniques and future innovations will play a critical role in overcoming challenges and achieving higher accuracy, efficiency, and robustness in wireless positioning systems. Integrating these methodologies will remain an ongoing focus in research and practical deployments."}, {"title": "III.

This enhances the realism of interactive simulations and allows for seamless transitions between indoor and outdoor environments in XR-based applications.\n4) Indoor Tracking and Navigation: Wireless positioning systems transform navigation within complex indoor environments [68]\u2013[71], such as airports, shopping malls, and hospitals. These systems provide users with precise guidance to specific locations, improving efficiency and saving time in environments where traditional GPS signals are unreliable. For businesses, indoor navigation enhances operational workflows and provides opportunities for personalized user engagement, while improving overall customer experience.\n5) Public Safety: Public safety applications greatly benefit from wireless AI positioning, particularly in emergency scenarios where speed and accuracy are critical [72], [73].

This data supports the optimization of training programs and enhances performance evaluations, providing athletes and coaches with actionable insights to refine techniques and strategies.\n9) Healthcare: In healthcare settings, wireless positioning enables real-time tracking of patients, staff, and equipment, improving the delivery of medical services and overall operational efficiency [79]. For instance, real-time location monitoring in critical care units, such as intensive care units or operating rooms, allows for rapid response to emergencies, potentially saving lives in time-sensitive situations.\n10) UAV positioning: UAVs depend on wireless AI positioning for accurate navigation, collision avoidance, and stable operation in applications like surveillance, delivery, and disaster response [80]\u2013[82]. In GPS-denied environments, such as indoors or dense urban areas, wireless positioning systems using technologies like UWB and 5G enable precise localization.

Emerging Wireless Technologies", "content": "Emerging wireless technologies are reshaping the landscape of wireless positioning by introducing novel architectures and signal propagation characteristics that enhance accuracy, scalability, and reliability. Key advancements include cell-free networks, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), THz communications, and RIS. Subsequently, we will introduce several key technologies.\n1) Massive MIMO: Massive MIMO technology, with its deployment of large-scale antenna arrays at base stations (BSs), significantly improves spatial resolution and beamforming precision. This enhances the ability to estimate parameters such as the angles-of-arrival (AOA), direction-of-arrival (DOA), angle-of-departure (AOD), and TOA. The high spatial diversity provided by massive MIMO also mitigates the effects of multipath propagation, making it a cornerstone for precise positioning in 5G and beyond. Additionally, Flexible Location MIMO [83], based on fluid antennas and movable antennas, represents a novel antenna paradigm. These antennas can move dynamically to avoid interference and obstacles, ensuring fast and reliable wireless transmission.\n2) Cell-Free: Cell-free networks utilize a distributed architecture where a dense network of access points (APs) collaborates to serve users [84]. This architecture mitigates inter-cell interference and provides seamless coverage, enhancing positioning accuracy, especially in dense urban or indoor environments. By exploiting the joint processing of signals from multiple APs, cell-free networks enable highly precise multi-AP positioning [84]. Additionally, the system's inherent flexibility supports adaptive coverage and robust performance in dynamic scenarios.\n3) Non-Terrestrial Networks: NTNs, encompassing satellite constellations, high-altitude platforms, and UAVs, extend wireless connectivity to remote and underserved areas [85]. These networks complement terrestrial systems by providing wide-area coverage and redundancy. For positioning, NTNS offer unique advantages, such as a clear LOS and large coverage areas, enabling applications in maritime, aviation, and disaster recovery scenarios.\n4) Terahertz, Networks: THz communication operates in the spectrum above 100 GHz, offering ultra-wide bandwidths that allow high-resolution parameter estimation. The short wavelength of THz signals enables precise localization through fine-grained TOA and AOA measurements. These networks are particularly suited for ultra-dense environments and applications requiring sub-centimeter positioning accuracy, such as industrial automation and XR [18].\n5) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces: RIS technology uses programmable metasurfaces to manipulate electromagnetic waves, creating controllable propagation environments. By dynamically adjusting reflection, refraction, or scattering, RIS can enhance signal quality, and improve positioning accuracy in challenging environments. For example, RIS can redirect signals to establish virtual LOS paths or amplify weak signals in dense urban areas [86]. The integration of RIS with AI-driven positioning systems promises unprecedented levels of control and precision, though challenges such as hardware scalability and real-time optimization remain.\n6) Near-field communication: Near-field Communication enhances wireless positioning by leveraging spherical wavefronts in close proximity environments, enabling precise parameter estimation like phase and amplitude variations [87]. This improves accuracy in technologies such as massive MIMO and RIS, making it ideal for applications like indoor navigation and industrial automation. However, near-field communication increases computational complexity and requires advanced models to capture wavefront characteristics, presenting both opportunities and challenges for next-generation wireless networks.\nThe integration of these technologies significantly enhances wireless positioning capabilities. By leveraging their unique characteristics, such as improved spatial resolution in massive MIMO, flexibility in RIS, and wide coverage in NTNs, these advancements address the limitations of conventional systems. Furthermore, combining these technologies with AI holds promise for achieving robust, scalable, and ultra-precise positioning in next-generation wireless networks."}, {"title": "C.

Based on path loss, signal strength inherently reflects the spatial relationship between the transmitter and receiver. This characteristic makes received signal strength (RSS) metrics, such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and reference signal received power (RSRP), valuable measurements for wireless positioning.

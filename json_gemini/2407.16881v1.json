Additionally,\nAI techniques are increasingly utilized in fields such as\nbiology, chemistry, physics, art, and architecture, addressing\ncomplex challenges across diverse domains Garvey and\nPatrick (2023); Doughty et al. (2024); Williamson (2024);\nNithithanatchinnapat et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024). Concepts\nlike \"neural networks\" and \"deep learning\" have gained\nwidespread recognition, enabling individuals to perform\ntasks previously reserved for experts.\nIn an era marked by rapid advancements in artificial\nintelligence (AI), the pivotal role of education in preparing\nthe next generation of AI professionals has become\nincreasingly evident Zhou et al. (2021); Brusilovsky (2024);\nZhou et al. (2022). Given the prevalence of AI, it has\nnaturally become a central focus in the education of\ncomputer scientists, and as AI continues to permeate various\naspects of society, the vision and strategies adopted by\niversities in shaping AI education programs hold profound\nimplications for the future workforce and innovation\nlandscape Wang and Yu (2023); Druga et al. (2022); Gibellini\net al. (2023). However, the fast pace of AI developments\nposes a significant challenge in crafting a curriculum that\nkeeps up with the latest advancements over an extended\nperiod.\nRecognizing the growing importance of Artificial Intel-\nligence (AI) in modern technology, the Association for\nComputing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical\nand Electronics Engineers \u2013 Computer Society (IEEE-CS)\ncollaborated with the Association for the Advancement of\nArtificial Intelligence (AAAI) to integrate Al more compre-\nhensively into the latest revision of their curricular guide-\nlines, known as CS2023 Eaton and Epstein (2024). Within\nthe AI Knowledge Area (KA), twelve knowledge units were\nidentified, with five units partitioned among the Computer\nScience (CS) Core, the KA Core, and electives (Fundamental\nIssues, Search, Fundamental Knowledge Representation and\nReasoning (KRR), Machine Learning, Applications, and\nSocietal Impact). Given these significant updates to AI edu-\ncation standards, understanding and comparing the curricu-\nlum structures of AI education across universities worldwide\nbecomes imperative.

The TF-IDF score for\na term t in a document d is given by\nTF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \u00d7 log \\frac{N}{DF(t)}\n(1)\nwhere TF(t, d) is the term frequency of t in document\nd, DF(t) is the document frequency of term t (number\nof documents containing t), and N is the total number\nof documents. To reduce the dimensionality of the TF-\nIDF matrix and capture the most significant features,\nTruncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied,\nwhich reduces the feature space to 50 dimensions, making\nsubsequent clustering more efficient. Mathematically, SVD\ndecomposes the matrix X as X \u2248 UE\u03a3VT, where U and\nV are orthogonal matrices and \u03a3 is a diagonal matrix with\nsingular values. The reduced feature matrix is then clustered\nusing the KMeans algorithm with the number of clusters k\nset to 8.

As depicted in Figure 1, several notable\nobservations emerge from the analysis:\nAcross all institutions, core units in AI education\nprograms are depicted as compulsory requirements, core\nmodules, or essential units for understanding foundational\nknowledge in this field. These core units are represented\nin the stacked bar chart as the purple portion of the bars,\nindicating their universal inclusion in the curriculum. In\naddition, most programs offer optional units in AI, referred\nto as \"options\" or \"electives,\" providing students with\nflexibility and choice in their course selection. For example,\nthe University of Hong Kong offers different concentrations\ncovering multiple units to explore interconnected subjects\nsuch as Al in Business Technology and Finance, and AI in\nSmart City. This variety of optional units allows students to\ntailor their education to their interests and career aspirations,\nfostering specialization in specific areas of AI.\nWhile some universities offer comprehensive Al programs\nwith a wide range of core and optional units, others may\nonly refer to a few core units. This variation in program\nstructure may be attributed to differences in institutional\nfocus, program objectives, or the integration of AI into\nbroader academic disciplines. In the case of universities\nlike the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and\nthe University of Washington, their AI programs primarily\nfocus on core units related to AI research, reflecting\na specialized approach to the subject matter. Similarly,\ninstitutions such as Stanford University and Harvard\nUniversity offer specialized programs like the Artificial\nIntelligence Professional Certificate Program, which may\nemphasize core units tailored to specific professional\nobjectives rather than offering a broad range of elective\noptions. Furthermore, universities like the University of\nBritish Columbia (UBC) may structure their AI education\nas certificate or micro-certificate programs, limiting the\ncurriculum to core units necessary for certification. This\nstreamlined approach aligns with the program's objective\nof providing targeted training in AI skills within a shorter\ntimeframe.\nOverall, the analysis underscores the universal presence of\ncore units in Al education programs, alongside the provision\nof optional units for specialization. The varying approaches\nto AI education reflect the diverse needs and objectives\nof students and institutions, resulting in different program\nstructures tailored to meet specific academic, professional,\nand certification requirements.\nApart from the bar chart, we focus on the scatter plot,\nwhich offers further insights. This plot is generated using\nall course names from different categories and reveals\ncommon focuses among the core and elective units in AI\nundergraduate education. (Figure 2). Based on this scatter\nplot, which visualizes the clustering of courses among\ndifferent universities, several key observations can be made:\n\u2022 Focus on Fundamental AI Concepts: The largest\ncluster located on the top right of the figure suggests\na strong emphasis on fundamental AI concepts across\nuniversities.

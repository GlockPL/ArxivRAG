It plays integral roles in finance, healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement, alongside various applications in computer science. Additionally, AI techniques are increasingly utilized in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, art, and architecture, addressing complex challenges across diverse domains Garvey and Patrick (2023); Doughty et al. (2024); Williamson (2024); Nithithanatchinnapat et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024). Concepts like \"neural networks\" and \"deep learning\" have gained widespread recognition, enabling individuals to perform tasks previously reserved for experts.\nIn an era marked by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the pivotal role of education in preparing the next generation of AI professionals has become increasingly evident Zhou et al. (2021); Brusilovsky (2024); Zhou et al. (2022). Given the prevalence of AI, it has naturally become a central focus in the education of computer scientists, and as AI continues to permeate various aspects of society, the vision and strategies adopted by universities in shaping AI education programs hold profound implications for the future workforce and innovation landscape Wang and Yu (2023); Druga et al. (2022); Gibellini et al. (2023). However, the fast pace of AI developments poses a significant challenge in crafting a curriculum that keeps up with the latest advancements over an extended period.\nRecognizing the growing importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in modern technology, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \u2013 Computer Society (IEEE-CS) collaborated with the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) to integrate AI more comprehensively into the latest revision of their curricular guidelines, known as CS2023 Eaton and Epstein (2024). Within the AI Knowledge Area (KA), twelve knowledge units were identified, with five units partitioned among the Computer Science (CS) Core, the KA Core, and electives (Fundamental Issues, Search, Fundamental Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR), Machine Learning, Applications, and Societal Impact). Given these significant updates to AI education standards, understanding and comparing the curriculum structures of AI education across universities worldwide becomes imperative. My research aims to analyze these curricula to identify best practices, gaps, and opportunities for improvement, ensuring that AI education remains aligned with industry demands and technological advancements.\nBy systematically gathering information on undergraduate AI programs and related courses from a select group of leading universities, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI education at the undergraduate level, shedding light on the curriculum structures, course offerings, and educational priorities shaping the next generation of AI professionals. Drawing from our research objectives, our research aims to address several following questions:\n1.

Institutions from nine countries spanning four continents are included for detailed examination. These regions encompass the United States and Canada in North America, the United Kingdom and Italy in Europe, China (encompassing both mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Singapore, Malaysia, and India in Asia, in addition to Australia in Oceania.\nThe data collection methodology for this study involved a thorough investigation of university websites, with a specific focus on institutions listed in the QS World University Rankings Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) (2024). Among the 72 universities distinguished for their prowess in these domains, particular emphasis was placed on identifying universities offering undergraduate programs in Artificial Intelligence (\u0391\u0399)."}, {"title": "Analytical Metrics", "content": "In the following section, we employ various analytical techniques to gain insights into our dataset of course names. We utilize methods such as word clouds to visualize popular words in course names, bar charts to depict the distribution of courses across different categories and the popularity of various Al courses, scatter plots to illustrate clusters within the course dataset, and comparative analysis across continents.\nThe Scatter Plot Clustering method involves several steps to analyze and visualize course clustering across universities. First, the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique is used to convert the textual data of course names into numerical features. The TF-IDF score for a term t in a document d is given by\nTF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) \u00d7 log(N/DF(t)) (1)\nwhere TF(t, d) is the term frequency of t in document d, DF(t) is the document frequency of term t (number of documents containing t), and N is the total number of documents. To reduce the dimensionality of the TF-IDF matrix and capture the most significant features, Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied, which reduces the feature space to 50 dimensions, making subsequent clustering more efficient. Mathematically, SVD decomposes the matrix X as X \u2248 UEVT, where U and V are orthogonal matrices and \u2211 is a diagonal matrix with singular values. The reduced feature matrix is then clustered using the KMeans algorithm with the number of clusters k set to 8. The algorithm partitions the data into k clusters by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS):\nWCSS = \u03a3\u03a3 ||x \u2212 \u03bc\u03ad ||2 (2)"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "This section presents the analytical results derived from the collected data, offering insights into the educational landscape of AI programs across the selected universities. The analysis includes a detailed examination of curriculum structures, identification of core AI topics, and a comparative analysis of Al education across different regions."}, {"title": "Analysis of Curriculum Structures", "content": "Most AI-related undergraduate programs are structured as bachelor's degree programs, designed to equip students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in AI. Additionally, some programs offer specialized tracks or concentrations within the broader field of AI, serving as major pathways for students pursuing careers in AI research or related areas such as Computer Science (CS).\nTo comprehend the academic structure of each university's curriculum, we utilize a stacked bar chart, depicting the distribution of courses across diverse categories for each institution. As depicted in Figure 1, several notable observations emerge from the analysis:\nAcross all institutions, core units in AI education programs are depicted as compulsory requirements, core modules, or essential units for understanding foundational knowledge in this field. These core units are represented in the stacked bar chart as the purple portion of the bars, indicating their universal inclusion in the curriculum. In addition, most programs offer optional units in AI, referred to as \"options\" or \"electives,\" providing students with flexibility and choice in their course selection. For example, the University of Hong Kong offers different concentrations covering multiple units to explore interconnected subjects such as Al in Business Technology and Finance, and AI in Smart City. This variety of optional units allows students to tailor their education to their interests and career aspirations, fostering specialization in specific areas of AI.\nWhile some universities offer comprehensive Al programs with a wide range of core and optional units, others may only refer to a few core units. This variation in program structure may be attributed to differences in institutional focus, program objectives, or the integration of AI into broader academic disciplines. In the case of universities like the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and the University of Washington, their AI programs primarily focus on core units related to AI research, reflecting a specialized approach to the subject matter. Similarly, institutions such as Stanford University and Harvard University offer specialized programs like the Artificial Intelligence Professional Certificate Program, which may emphasize core units tailored to specific professional objectives rather than offering a broad range of elective options. Furthermore, universities like the University of British Columbia (UBC) may structure their AI education as certificate or micro-certificate programs, limiting the curriculum to core units necessary for certification. This streamlined approach aligns with the program's objective of providing targeted training in AI skills within a shorter timeframe.\nOverall, the analysis underscores the universal presence of core units in Al education programs, alongside the provision of optional units for specialization. The varying approaches to AI education reflect the diverse needs and objectives of students and institutions, resulting in different program structures tailored to meet specific academic, professional, and certification requirements.\nApart from the bar chart, we focus on the scatter plot, which offers further insights. This plot is generated using all course names from different categories and reveals common focuses among the core and elective units in AI undergraduate education. (Figure 2). Based on this scatter plot, which visualizes the clustering of courses among different universities, several key observations can be made:\n\u2022 Focus on Fundamental AI Concepts: The largest cluster located on the top right of the figure suggests a strong emphasis on fundamental AI concepts across universities. Keywords such as \"Introduction to AI,\" \"Fundamentals of AI,\" and \"AI Theory\" dominate this cluster, indicating a focus on foundational issues in AI education."}, {"title": "Identification of Core AI Topics", "content": "To gain insights into the core components of undergraduate AI education across different universities and compare them with the Al knowledge areas outlined in the CS2023 curriculum guidance, we have collected the names of core units from various undergraduate programs. These core units represent the foundational pillars upon which AI education is built, encompassing essential topics and concepts integral to understanding and applying Al principles.\nIn this study, we present a word cloud generated from the compilation of core unit names from diverse undergraduate AI programs (Figure 4). This word cloud provides a comprehensive overview of the core units taught in AI undergraduate education, offering valuable insights into the common themes and focal areas across different universities. By visually representing the frequency and prominence of core unit names, the word cloud sheds light on the essential components of AI education and highlights the diverse approaches taken by institutions in structuring their undergraduate curricula. Observations from the generated word cloud are as follows:\n\u2022 Prominence of Foundational Concepts: The word cloud prominently features terms like \u201cmachine learning\", \"Programming\u201d, \u201cAlgorithm\u201d, \u201cIntroduction\" and \"fundamentals,\" indicating their central role in AI education. These terms likely represent core courses that lay the groundwork for understanding Al princi-ples, algorithms, and methodologies as recommended in CS2023.\n\u2022 Coverage of Application-Focused Units: While application-focused units may not dominate the cloud, their presence is notable, indicating a comprehensive coverage of AI applications across the surveyed universities. Their representation across multiple universities indicates a recognition of the importance of practical skills and knowledge in applying AI techniques to real-world problems. These units likely cover topics such as AI in healthcare, finance, robotics, or other specific domains, aligning with CS2023's emphasis on the application of AI techniques in diverse contexts.\n\u2022 Presence of Elective Units: Additionally, units such as \"computer vision\" and \"natural language processing\" stand out, although to a lesser extent compared to the basic concept. Their appearance suggests that while not required as core units in the CS2023 Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Area, these topics are recognized as important units within Al curricula. Their inclusion reflects a focus on specialized areas of AI, allowing students to deepen their knowledge and expertise based on their interests and career aspirations.\nOverall, the word cloud provides a snapshot of AI education that aligns with the CS2023 guidance, encompassing a balance of foundational knowledge and practical applications.

Firstly, we employ the aforementioned stacked bar chart to stack various categories of courses from each university, facilitating the visualization and comparison of curriculum patterns across different continents.\nFrom Figure 5, we can find that Asian universities stand out with the highest number of courses and variety in their curriculum structures. Specifically, six out of eight Asian universities provide more than 28 courses, reflecting a rich and diverse curriculum. Contrasting the Asian universities' rich curriculum offerings, universities from other continents, particularly North America, present a contrasting pattern with a lower average number of courses. For example, Oceania universities offer an average of around 21 courses, while those in the North America provide approximately 16 courses on average. This disparity can be attributed to the fact that the majority (6 out of 8) of programs offered by North American universities focus on AI research-related courses or certificate programs.\nUniversities in Europe, including the UK and Italy, showcase a distinctive trend in offering AI bachelor's degrees with a consistent four-year structure. Most universities in this region follow a uniform model, featuring a blend of compulsory core units alongside elective options for students. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend. Liverpool Hope University stands out by offering only mandatory units, without any AI related elective choices. Conversely, The University of Edinburgh adopts a unique approach by offering a broader range of electives across other schools, in addition to mandatory units, enhancing the interdisciplinary aspect of the program.

To address some of these challenges, we formed an interdisciplinary consortium to develop a federated health data network, comprised of six institutions across five countries, to facilitate Nordic-Baltic cooperation on secondary use of health data. The objective of this report is to offer early insights into our experiences developing this network. We used a mixed-method approach, combining both experimental design and implementation science to evaluate the factors affecting the implementation of our network. Technically, our experiments indicate that the network functions without significant performance degradation compared to centralized simulation.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "The advent of deep learning (DL) models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era of Artificial Intelligence (Al) with profound implications for various domains, including healthcare. However, model training needs vast amounts of data, often as centralized repositories, which raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security, and heterogeneity. To address these challenges, decentralized approaches such as federated learning (FL) have emerged as promising alternatives, where models can be trained securely across multiple institutions without sharing patient data. In this study, we report on a Nordic-Baltic federated health data network initiative designed to facilitate the development of DL models for healthcare applications.\nMost research to date has focused on controlled laboratory settings. Though valuable, these studies often lack the complexity and unpredictability of real-world applications. Our work represents one of the first attempts to implement an FL network in a practical, operational environment across national borders. This report's objectives are to show technical feasibility and offer actionable insights into the practical implications and broader contextual factors."}, {"title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "content": "To achieve these two objectives, we consider a mixed-method approach that combines two complementary fields of research; data science and implementation science. This interdisciplinary approach to studying translational research in healthcare exploits methods native to each of the fields, resulting in a unique blend of both qualitative and quantitative analysis.\nFederated network requirements and experimental design\nThe consortium (FederatedHealth) includes Norwegian Centre for E-health Research (NSE) at the University Hospital of North Norway, DNV's Healthcare Program (DNV, Norway), Stockholm University (DSV, Sweden), County Council of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland/University Hospital of Link\u00f6ping (CC\u00d6, Sweden), University of Copenhagen (KU, Denmark), University of Turku (UTU, Finland), University of Tartu (UT, Estonia), Cambio (Sweden) and Omilon (Denmark). The datasets available in this consortium are electronic health record (EHR) data from large regional hospitals in the respective countries. However, at this stage we use non-sensitive, publicly available[1], health data for a named entity recognition task; extracting keywords related to medical findings in clinical texts."}, {"title": "Qualitative analysis through implementation science", "content": "Even though implementation science is a recent field, it has demonstrated its potential to enhance our understanding of Al implementation in healthcare[2]. To complement the technical experiments,"}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "Performance comparison\nAs shown in Table 1, our experimental results demonstrated that the number of clients participating in the FL network had no significant impact on the performance of the global model, suggesting the global model generalized effectively across varying client participation levels.\nIn our data imbalance experiment (see Table 2), where the clients contributed varying amounts of data to the FL process, we found no significant differences in the performance of the global model.\nThese results generally confirm that our technical setup is sound, but the results should be interpreted with caution since the network is relatively small and consists of six sites. In addition, we did not consider class imbalance and the time factor, since training with a physically distributed setup, with varying network bandwidth and hardware requires a longer training time compared to a well-controlled simulation environment."}, {"title": "Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)", "content": "Across the five domains (I-V below), we paid closer attention only to the most pertinent constructs to our context and added some extra constructs we considered important for federated networks, for a total of seventeen points of reflection.\nI. Innovation domain\n1. Innovation design and costs: We used an existing FL framework because of budgetary constraints. Combining the practical insights from interdisciplinary brainstorming sessions with the knowledge gained from the literature, we were able to formulate a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional requirements that informed the choice and configuration of our FL framework.\n2. Innovation source: Our selected FL framework, Nvidia Flare [4], is developed by a generally reputable vendor and incorporates several defensive mechanisms for ensuring the security and privacy of data during federated learning. The framework aligns well with recently published recommendations (2986-2023 - IEEE Recommended Practice for Privacy and Security for Federated Machine Learning).\n3. Innovation complexity and adaptability: Since the data remains securely stored within each institution, the framework itself can be swapped out or upgraded without altering the underlying data infrastructure. This modularity allows our consortium to adopt new frameworks or algorithms with minimal disruption.\n4. Common data model (CDM): Harmonizing data in federated learning tasks is a foundational step that ensures reliability, accuracy, fairness and efficiency of the entire task as well as a technical necessity. In this project, we chose to employ a commonly used solution, namely the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which is an open community data standard.\n5. Data and Model security: FL enhances privacy by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. However, this distributed approach also introduces significant security challenges. Data security in FL is focused on protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, leakage, and inference attacks. To counter these threats, we employed various defense mechanisms such as multifactor authentication and other mechanisms such as differential privacy (see Appendix 2).\n6. Data de-identification: To prevent the leakage of personal information, text must be de-identified using sanitization tools before uploading them to the federated clients. Similarly, to reduce disclosure risk, large language models should be built using de-identified and pseudonymized text[5-7]. We used clinical text de-identification tools developed within the consortium[8].\nII. Outer setting domain\n7. Local conditions and financing: There seems to be general political support for cross-border collaborations for digital health initiatives within the European area. This is evidenced by multiple funding opportunities aiming to increase use of Al in healthcare, of which the current initiative is a beneficiary.\n8. Legal and ethical considerations: As there is currently no European-wide harmonized regulation governing the secondary use of health data in a multi-country federated health data network (FHDN) (since the European Health Data Space regulation is not yet applicable), the applicable legislation remains the GDPR, along with national data laws regulating the access and use of health data for R&D purposes. Consortium members jointly determine the purposes and means of data processing within the FHDN, acting as joint controllers with respect to the network. Each consortium member is responsible for fulfilling all legal obligations in their respective countries, including obtaining the necessary administrative and/or ethical committee permits required, to ensure lawful data handling and to uphold the project's integrity across all jurisdictions. The process addressing ethical and legal considerations should be seen as cyclical, rather than linear, because some issues should be addressed repeatedly during the process for ethical and legal risk minimization.\nIII. Inner setting domain\n9. Available resources: Collectively, our consortium has all the expertise we need (data science, IT, cybersecurity, ethics and legal, as well as healthcare) but there are large disparities at each site in the different countries, presenting unique challenges.\n10. Funding: We need the different expertise represented in each country or site, and the cost implications of such a setup are substantial. Our current consortium's financial resources are not nearly enough, underscoring the need for strategic resource allocation to ensure long-term viability.\n11. Materials and equipment: In addition to personnel costs, there are infrastructural expenses for deploying and maintaining the necessary hardware and software at each site. As a requirement, we collectively decided on at minimum a single graphics processing unit (GPU) at each site, since it is easy to scale.\n12. Communications: The cost of coordinating and managing collaboration across different countries is high, including time spent in regular communication and problem-solving. In our case, a considerable amount of time was spent problem-solving (eg. firewall issues), especially in the initial phases. Since each site has discretion on how they participate, including adhering to their own security policy, the right expertise is required at each site, and this was not always possible.\n13. Culture - code of conduct: As highlighted in [9], a federation providing access to sensitive health data should be guided by three primary objectives: maintaining patient trust, ensuring the ethical use of sensitive data, and fostering trustworthiness among its members. In scenarios where data remains decentralized and participants come from diverse origins, cultures, or operate under varying legal frameworks, a code of conduct becomes an essential tool. For these reasons, our consortiums developed and implemented a comprehensive code of conduct (see Appendix 1).\nIV. Individuals domain\n14. Leaders and facilitators: Our consortium is comprised of senior professors, junior researchers and business executives, a diversity that creates an environment with high-level leaders, opinion leaders and team members that facilitate implementation. However, there are distinct differences in work ethic and culture among the countries in the consortium, despite all the countries being within northern Europe.\n15. Technical jargon: For our collaborative network to function, it is important to convey complex ideas effectively across disciplines. Our principal strategy for dealing with the problem of technical jargon within our multidisciplinary teams was organizing cross-disciplinary workshops to build a shared vocabulary, and encourage team members to avoid overly technical language during meetings.\n16. Capability: Ensuring the security and integrity of the federated learning network requires highly skilled individuals at each participating institution. For example, for every FL job, there has to be someone who thoroughly understands the code that is executed on their local client node.\nV. Implementation process domain\n17. Teaming: Teaming was our primary tool for dealing with the complexity of the interdisciplinary approach. Creating specialized teams within the consortium proved essential for addressing the diverse range of tasks required to successfully implement our network. These teams operated collaboratively yet independently, ensuring that each task was approached with the appropriate depth of expertise and focus."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "Our experimental work demonstrates that FL can be a viable solution for training LLMs on sensitive health data, opening the door to broader collaboration across national borders. Thus, FL can facilitate international research and innovation by allowing institutions to share insights and build more accurate, globally representative Al models.\nOur experiences highlight the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration and structured organizational processes, and also call attention to the legal and economic perspectives. The interdisciplinary framework developed through this work can serve as a foundation for tackling non-technical challenges.\nLimitations"}, {"title": "Future work", "content": "Since we have five languages in our consortium (three Germanic and two Finno-Ugric), we have begun focusing on multilingual aspects of training LLMs. We will also investigate the commercial viability of our solution to maximize its impact on global health."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "Our experiences show that cross-border implementation of a collaborative network in the current uncertain regulatory environment, though feasible, requires significant human and technical resources. This presents scalability challenges, especially for smaller institutions with limited infrastructure and expertise. Further research is required to explore more efficient and accessible solutions to foster data-driven healthcare innovation across borders."}]}

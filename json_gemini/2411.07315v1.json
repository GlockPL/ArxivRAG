Smartphones, with their array of built-in sensors, offer a practical and affordable solution for road-sensing. However, the lack of reliable, standardized datasets has hindered progress in assessing road conditions and driving patterns. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive dataset derived from smartphone sensors, which surpasses existing datasets by incorporating a diverse range of sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS, gravity, orientation, and uncalibrated sensors. These sensors capture extensive parameters such as acceleration force, gravitation, rotation rate, magnetic field strength, and vehicle speed, providing a detailed understanding of road conditions and driving behaviors. The dataset is designed to enhance road safety, infrastructure maintenance, traffic management, and urban planning. By making this dataset available to the community, the study aims to foster collaboration, inspire further research, and facilitate the development of innovative solutions in intelligent transportation systems.", "sections": [{"title": "Background & Summary", "content": "According to statistics, worldwide car usage is expected to almost double by 2040 1. More vehicles require exploring new technologies and methods to guarantee road safety, including driver assistance systems, driver monitoring devices, and driver training programs. The safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians can be threatened by aggressive and unpredictable driving, as well as by traffic conditions (slippery roads, obstacles on the road, mudslides, animals on the road, etc.). 2 Researchers observed more honking, rude gestures, and unsafe lane changes by drivers on roads with more potholes and other anomalies because these roads require more attention and vehicle control, which can make drivers angry. Other factors that contribute to this risk include fatigue, alcohol consumption, and the use of a cell phone while driving 3-6. Driving behaviors vary from person to person; a person's character and habits influence how they will respond in a potentially risky circumstance while operating a vehicle 7,8. An aggressive driver adopts a driving style that combines high speeds with frequent and abrupt changes in instantaneous speed, resulting in abrupt accelerations and decelerations. In recent years, there has been a significant focus on driving behavior analytics as a crucial tool to improve road safety 9-11.\nHigh-quality road infrastructure ensures efficient movement of people, goods, and facilities, as well as access to a variety of economic and social activities. The consequences of climate change, city expansion, population growth, and improved road design are some of the reasons that can cause transportation infrastructure to rapidly deteriorate. Road anomalies such as potholes, cracks, and bumps are common due to this degradation and can be observed on roads throughout the world 12. Untreated pavement cracks can lead to defects in potholes and other roads, including dents, bumps, and alligator cracks. These problems could result in acute damage to vehicle suspension systems or even increase the probability of life-threatening accidents. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that road accidents worldwide cause 20 to 50 million injuries and approximately 1.3 million deaths annually 13,14. In 2014, the AAA Motor Club reported that automobile damage caused by potholes alone in the United States cost 6.4 billion dollars 15.\nThe monitoring of road condition could result in numerous advantages from an economic, safety, and productivity point of view 16,17. To solve the challenges of efficient and accurate detection of road anomalies, researchers are now exploring new technical solutions. For example, Seraj et al. 18 used smartphones with GPS and inertial sensors, gyroscopes, and accelerometers to study the morphology of road surfaces. They proposed a system to detect anomalies in real-time, employing wavelet decomposition and an SVM. Celaya-Padilla et al. 19 proposed a novel technique that uses GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors mounted on a car to identify road anomalies, especially speed bumps. A genetic algorithm was used to create a logistic model based on sensor data. These studies suggest that the use of smartphone sensors is a viable and affordable way to identify road anomalies. The concept is well defined, but the lack of standard data sets and effective evaluation methodologies prevents researchers from acquiring a complete picture and viewpoint on potential solutions. Without standard datasets and assessment tools, it is impossible to identify the drawbacks, benefits, and challenges of different solutions.\nIn response to the lack of a benchmark dataset, several solutions have been proposed. Fox et al. 20 developed three crowd-sourcing methods for detecting potholes, considering differences in vehicles, the asynchronous operation of sensors, GPS errors, and sensor noise. To address the limited availability of significant training data, the authors used CarSim (http://www.carsim.com/), a simulator program, to generate training data. Subsequently, the model performance was validated using a real-world dataset obtained by driving on city roads near the General Motors campus in Warren, MI, USA. In another study, Fox et al. 21 introduced an approach that considered road inclination and bank angle data to identify and locate potholes in multilane scenarios. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 15 introduced a new dataset to compare classification algorithms for the disruption of the road surface. Using smartphones, the data set was collected using 12 cars and trucks in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico. However, the data set is no longer publicly available. Allouch et al. 13 developed an Android application to predict road quality using GPS, triaxial accelerometers, and gyroscope sensors in real-time. After data collection, a C4.5 decision tree classifier was used to classify the data. Carlos et al. 12 published Pothole Lab, a cutting-edge open-access web platform that facilitates the creation of virtual roads with customizable types and numbers of anomalies on the route. Using this dataset, they evaluated the detection approaches for road anomalies based on accelerometer readings.\nY. Chen et al. 22 suggested an approach with two phases: road anomaly segmentation and detection. During the segmentation phase, road anomaly subsequences were recovered from the sensor data using a piecewise aggregate approximation model. Scale-invariant characteristics were learned from short local segments during the detection phase to improve accuracy. Three datasets were used in their investigation, and data collection was performed using an Android application that used video, GPS, and acceleration measures. The pothole laboratory produced the second data set used in the study 12. They created the third dataset using the CarSim simulator, according to the methodology of the reference study 20.\nOn the other hand, Zheng et al. 23 presented a querying and recompiling approach for road anomaly detection that requires less data. To validate the model, they used two datasets. The initial data set used was obtained from the research on road anomaly detection by Carlos et al. 12. To enhance the authenticity of the approach, they added anomalies to existing road data based on the proportions of other datasets found in 13,15. Following the research presented in 20, they also used the CarSim simulator to obtain the second data set. In another study, Carlos et al. 24 introduced a more intelligent method for characterizing potholes and speed bumps. They used regression, classification, and learning-to-rank techniques. To conduct this study, they collected the data set driving across Chihuahua, Mexico, in 2018. Similarly, Zheng et al. 25 introduced a technique to identify road anomalies by comparing data windows of different lengths using the dynamic time warping (DTW) method on acceleration data. This research used a similar data set from their previous study 22.\nResearchers have also conducted numerous studies on the identification of driving behavior. Zylius et al. 26 introduced an approach for classifying driving styles using data from a 3-axis accelerometer (G-sensor). The objective was to detect both safe and aggressive driving behaviors. Light vehicle data were collected for driving modes and several characteristics were examined. Carlos et al. 27 proposed a second-order representation utilizing a bag-of-words technique to model accelerometer timestamps related to aggressive driving maneuvers. Binary and multiclass classification scenarios were used to analyze this representation. They used three data sets in their research. Initially, they used the \u017dylius Data Set 26, consisting of triaxial accelerometer readings in normal and aggressive driving scenarios. Second, they used the Ferreira et al.28 dataset. This data set was appropriate for multiclass classification because it included various aggressive driving events divided into seven categories. Third, the authors presented their dataset, which contains instances of single aggressive driving maneuvers."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "In this section, we present the data collection strategy and analysis. Figure 1 outlines the comprehensive strategy, while subsequent subsections detail the experimental setup, parameter selection, route planning, data collection session, and considerations regarding data storage and security.\nFor this study, we utilized a Xiaomi Poco X2 smartphone running Android 4.0, with the Sensor Logger app version 1.21.0, available on Google Play.

These sensors fall primarily into hardware-based and software-based categories. Hardware sensors are used to determine environmental factors, motion, and orientation. When data are from hardware-based sensors, software-based sensors can dynamically compute values, including linear acceleration, orientation, and gravity. However, these sensors can be broadly classified into three groups: motion, environmental, and position sensors 33. Motion sensors can detect movements such as rotation (roll, which is front-to-back; pitch, which is side-to-side; and yaw, which is up-down), as well as shaking and vibration of a device. Position sensors provide the location of an object relative to a local coordinate system. When the data obtained from the accelerometer and the geomagnetic field sensor are incorporated, the exact location of the device can be determined. Environmental sensors can assess a multitude of parameters, such as humidity, illumination, atmospheric pressure, and temperature."}, {"title": "Route planning", "content": "The data collection process was conducted in Rajshahi, a major city in Bangladesh. Before starting the data collection session, specific zones in the city were delineated where road anomalies such as bumps and potholes were detected. A comprehensive catalog was created containing each selected area's longitude and latitude coordinates. The data collectors then strategized and created a route plan to travel through these selected areas."}, {"title": "Alignment of Smartphone and Vehicle Coordinate Systems", "content": "Smartphone sensors utilize a conventional 3-axis coordinate system to represent data values, typically defined in relation to the device's screen. When the smartphone is positioned horizontally, the x-axis corresponds to the horizontal direction from left to right, the y-axis runs vertically from bottom to top, and the z-axis points perpendicular to the screen's face. As depicted in Figure 6, the smartphone's coordinate system was carefully aligned with the vehicle's coordinate system. This alignment ensures that the x-axis of the smartphone corresponds to the vehicle's longitudinal axis, the y-axis aligns with the lateral axis, and the z-axis aligns with the vertical axis. Consequently, the z-axis of the vehicle's coordinate system accurately represents the gravitational acceleration relative to the Earth's coordinate system. This careful alignment was crucial for accurately capturing the vehicle's motion and ensuring that the data collected by the smartphone sensors correctly reflected the vehicle's dynamics.\nEach sensor event yields multidimensional arrays of sensor readings for all motion sensors. During a single-sensor event, the accelerometer provides data on the acceleration force for the x, y, and z-axes. However, the gyroscope provides data on the rotation rate for the three coordinate axes. The gravity sensor provides a three-dimensional vector indicating the direction and strength of gravity. The orientation sensor can be used to calculate the orientation of a device. This sensor keeps track of the device's location in relation to the magnetic north pole. Changes in the magnetic field can be observed via the magnetometer sensor, which provides information about the raw-field strength for all three coordinate directions. Data values are recovered as a float array (values) together with other attributes of sensor events."}, {"title": "Data Collection Session", "content": "During the data collection process, the driver and data collectors knew the exact location of an anomaly on the road. The driver alerted the data collector to begin collecting data when the vehicle was close to an anomaly. The incident started to be recorded through the sensors on the smartphones. The data collector collected incident information after passing through the anomaly. Each event was handled using this procedure.\nThe details of the drivers involved in the study are as follows:\nDriver 1: Age 26, with 1 year of driving experience. This driver is relatively new to driving, with limited experience on the road.\nDriver 2: Age 32, with 4 years of driving experience. This driver has moderate driving experience, having been on the road for a few years.\nDriver 3: Age 27, with 2 years of driving experience. This driver has a couple of years of driving experience, indicating a growing familiarity with different driving conditions.\nData on aggressive driving, standard driving, and slow driving behavior were also collected using the same approach. Aggressive driving behavior is defined by a combination of actions and attitudes. Common indicators of reckless driving include exceeding the speed limit based on the present road conditions, making sudden lane changes without signaling or considering other vehicles, excessively and inappropriately using the vehicle's horn or headlights to express frustration or anger, and overlooking important traffic rules. Defining a baseline driving style for each driver has allowed deviations indicative of aggressive and slow driving to be identified. The features of baseline or standard driving behavior have included maintaining a consistent speed that aligns with road conditions and legal speed limits, and avoiding sudden and erratic accelerations or decelerations. Standard driving behavior has also involved smooth acceleration and braking, with gradual increases and decreases in speed to ensure a smooth driving experience 9. Aggressive and slow driving styles have been recognized as deviations from standard driving behavior. Aggressive driving has been identified when a driver's behavior significantly deviates from their normal driving, including exceeding speed limits, sudden braking or intense accelerations, and making sharp turns or hazardous overtakes. These actions increase the risk of losing control and require higher safety distances. Slow driving behavior, often intentional for safety, has been characterized by consistently driving below normal and legal speed limits, ensuring smooth and gentle speed changes, maintaining a larger-than-usual distance from the vehicle ahead, and executing lane changes and turns slowly with clear signaling 10. All these characteristics were considered when collecting data on aggressive, standard, and slow driving. The vehicle speed was intentionally reduced below the normal pace to collect data on slow driving. The vehicles had speed limits of 80-120 km/h, 40-60 km/h, and 20 km/h for aggressive driving, standard driving, and slow driving, respectively 11.\nThe entire data collection process involved driving a predetermined route that spans more than 30 kilometers. Safety was always the main concern during the data collection process, and all data collection activities were conducted meticulously in strict compliance with local traffic laws and regulations."}, {"title": "Calibration of Sensor Data", "content": "In the context of smartphone sensors, calibration refers to adjusting raw sensor data to account for any inherent inaccuracies or biases. The calibrated data has been adjusted to enhance accuracy and alignment with the genuine values. Uncalibrated data refers to the unprocessed output obtained directly from the sensor without any adjustments or corrections applied. Calibrated data offers more accurate and exact measurements, but uncalibrated data preserves the original sensor information, which might be useful for customized post-processing or advanced sensor fusion techniques.\nUsing the Sensor Logger Android app, both calibrated and uncalibrated data was collected for the accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope used in the study. The application undergoes an internal calibration to eliminate problems such as sensor drift and bias. Drift refers to the gradual change in sensor readings over time, while bias indicates a consistent offset from the true value even when no input is present. When the accelerometer is not moving, it should ideally measure a value of 0 m/s\u00b2 on the x and y axes and approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 on the z-axis, which is influenced by gravity. Any deviation from these values indicates bias. Similarly, when not moving, the gyroscope should indicate no rotation in any direction. However, flaws in the manufacturing process may indicate a slight but consistent rotation, which represents the gyroscope's bias.\nTo calibrate the sensors, the app takes multiple measurements under controlled conditions, such as the stationary device for the accelerometer and gyroscope or placed in a non-magnetic environment for the magnetometer. These measurements are used to determine and correct for biases, also known as zero-offset errors, which are consistent deviations from the true value when the sensor should read zero. For instance, if the gyroscope is completely stationary, it should ideally indicate 0 rotation along all axes. However, due to manufacturing flaws or environmental influences, it may exhibit minor yet consistent measurements, such as -0.43 rad/s along the x-axis, indicating the presence of bias. Calibration involves calculating the offset from these measurements, which is subsequently deducted from future readings to rectify the data. For the accelerometer, calibration can be mathematically expressed as:\n$C_a = S_a - O_a$\nwhere, $C_a$ is calibrated accelerometer output, $S_a$ is raw accelerometer measurement and $O_a$ is offset determined during calibration. After calibration, the accelerometer's x, y, and z values should ideally be reduced to zero while the device is not moving, thereby minimizing errors or deviations."}, {"title": "Data records.", "content": "Structure\nA copy of the database has been uploaded to Figshare 34. The data set is divided into two diverse types of folders: Road Anomaly Data and Driving Behavior Data. There are two types of data on road anomalies.

First, data files for road anomalies are extracted directly from the output files of smartphone sensors, such as Accelerometer.csv, Gravity.csv, and Gyroscope.csv. The overall average sampling rate for the dataset is 89.82 Hz, with observed rates ranging from 60 Hz to 99 Hz. This consistent average was maintained throughout the data acquisition process, providing a reliable dataset for both driving behavior and road anomaly analysis. These rates are aligned with typical acceptable sampling rates for smartphone sensors, which often range from 50 Hz to 100 Hz35. Such a sampling rate balances data resolution and storage requirements, making it suitable for capturing and analyzing dynamic events.

The primary objective was to document the entire data collection and preparation process, ensuring that the dataset is robust and reliable for further analysis. The technical limitations and costs associated with integrating physical sensors into automobiles are acknowledged. Financial factors often restrict the accessibility of data. Therefore, virtual sensors were emphasized in this situation to overcome financial problems.\nParticular attention was paid to the procedures followed to ensure a reliable dataset. Since smartphone sensors are the only tools used to collect data, there is a high chance that sensor malfunctions can affect data quality. The data set underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure its validity and efficacy for analysis. To fix possible technical problems or errors in the dataset, duplicate entries were found and eliminated. Consequently, the issue of missing values was addressed using two steps: first, any rows with missing values were eliminated to ensure the accuracy of the data, and second, the missing values in the columns were replaced with the mean values.\nHowever, beyond cleaning, a comprehensive approach was taken to validate the data through visualization and statistical analysis.

The following highlights how this dataset can be utilized to address practical issues and enhance our understanding of road safety, infrastructure maintenance, and autonomous vehicle technology.\nAnalyzing road anomalies with accelerometer data\nA key approach to evaluating how road anomalies affect vehicle dynamics is to determine the amount of bounce a vehicle experience by measuring its vertical acceleration. Accelerometers are crucial for evaluating how road anomalies affect vehicle dynamics by measuring acceleration in various axes. When a vehicle encounters road anomalies such as bumps or potholes, the accelerometer captures both vertical acceleration (indicating bounce) and rotational movements due to the disturbances37. On a flat, smooth road, the accelerometer primarily measures the force of gravity, which is approximated as an acceleration of 9.81 m/s\u00b2. This gravitational component can be represented as:\n$g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$\nIn addition to gravitational force, the accelerometer measures dynamic forces resulting from road anomalies. The total acceleration $a_{\\text{total}}$ recorded by the accelerometer is a combination of gravitational acceleration $\\hat{g}$ and dynamic acceleration $a_{\\text{dynamic}}$:\n$a_{\\text{total}} = a_{\\text{dynamic}} + \\hat{g}$\nTo accurately determine the vehicle's response to road anomalies, it is essential to isolate the dynamic acceleration $a_{\\text{dynamic}}$ by accounting for and subtracting the gravitational component.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the past decades, terrestrial wireless communication systems have developed explosively, making distinguished contributions and setting the foundation for the development of human civilization. The development of mobile communication systems has gone through 5 generations, from 1G in the 1980s to 5G in the early 2020s. However, as an inevitable development trend, 6G is expected to be launched in the 2030s to provide extreme data rate network services and realize real-time IIoT applications [1]. The architecture of 6G will completely cover Space-Air-Ground and underwater integrated networks [2]. As a core partition of future 6G networks, Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) have been envisioned to provide countless real-time intelligent applications. To realize this, promoting AI techniques into SAGIN is an inevitable trend. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous architecture of SAGIN, FL is emerging and becoming one of the most promising AI models for SAGIN. However, employing FL in SAGIN still faces some challenges. First, due to the large size and complexity of SAGIN, a large number of devices are required to collaborate to train a common model using an extremely large dataset. Moreover, as the dataset size and the required model complexity increase, traditional client devices may not be able to perform the local ML training efficiently. Therefore, developing efficient FL solutions capable of handling large datasets and complex ML models in SAGIN is significantly important. Second, client devices in SAGIN rely on radio transmissions, which can be subject to potential eavesdropping attacks due to long-distance transmission. The nature of radio transmission may allow malicious nodes to eavesdrop on wireless signals and obtain model gradients by brute force cracking, thus inferring the private information of clients. Moreover, handling big data and complex AI models and ensuring privacy and security in the long-distance transmission of AI models also represent significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose integrating FL into the SAGIN architectural framework to optimize system resource utilization, reduce communication latency and energy consumption, and enhance privacy and security, thereby realizing real-time, smart, and green 6G SAGIN-based IIoT applications.\nFrom a computational perspective, FL is a powerful dis-"}, {"title": "II. RECENT ADVANCES IN SAGINS AND FL", "content": "According to the operation location, SAGINS's architecture includes three main network layers: Space, Aerial and Ground [4], as shown in Fig. 1.\n* Satellites (Space Layer): This layer includes satellites operating in different orbits. Based on operating orbit, the Space layer can be divided into 3 sublayers, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO). The LEO layer includes LEO satellites equipped with computing power and storage resources. Each satellite plays a role as a server with the capacity to process data, support edge computing and relay data to ground stations. It should be noted that LEO satellites move very quickly around the Earth so communication between ground devices and LEO satellites is not always available. Besides, LEO satellites are resource-constrained, so offloading strategies need to consider the computational task completion time of LEO satellites. Meanwhile, the MEO and GEO layers play the main role in relaying raw data to LEO satellites and ground stations.\n* Air Layer: This layer consists of high-altitude platforms (HAP) such as UAVs that can offer broadband wireless connections and real-time edge computing services. Moreover, HAPs support offloading tasks and caching services to reduce the end-to-end delay and energy consumption for ground devices. However, the HAP's coverage and energy supply are relatively limited.\n* Ground Layer This layer includes all infrastructure and IoT network platforms deployed on the ground, such as base stations, sensors, vehicles, and ground computing centers. This layer collects data from devices and sensors to transceiver and execute calculated results from the above layers."}, {"title": "B.

FL consists of three main steps as follows.\n* Initialization: The server acts as an aggregator that initializes the computational tasks, the learning parameter set (known as the $w$ model), the learning rate and the number of communication rounds. Then, it sends parameters to the training partners.\n* Local Traning: The device $i^{th}$ uses the received $w$ model and its local dataset to train the more optimal"}, {"title": "C. Quantum FL", "content": "Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) with quantum networks is a cutting-edge approach that combines quantum computing and federated learning to enhance distributed machine learning. In QFL, quantum networks enable multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data, maintaining privacy. In QFL, instead of traditional data processing, quantum data is used to train machine learning models across distributed quantum devices. Each participating device processes its local quantum data and shares only model updates, preserving the privacy of sensitive information. Quantum algorithms process and exchange information, potentially offering significant speedups and improved learning performance over classical methods. Using quantum entanglement in the networks ensures secure communication between the parties involved. This approach holds promise for solving complex problems in domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart healthcare, and 6G ecosystems [6]. In order to improve security and privacy within the Internet of Things ecosystem, this survey article looks at how federated learning, quantum computing, and 6G wireless networks can be integrated. The research in [7] investigates how federated learning enables IoT devices to cooperatively train a model without exchanging data, protecting privacy, and quantum computing can enhance encryption for more secure IoT data. IoT device connectivity and real-time secure data processing are improved by combining 6G's low latency and high speed.

Vision of Integrating FL into SAGIN", "content": "The advent of 6G networks allows the provision of network services with extremely high throughput, leading to the explosive growth of real-time smart applications such as remote surgery, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and Metaverse [9]. These systems generate huge amounts of data that require real-time computational processing. However, terrestrial wireless networks only cover about 20% of the Earth's surface and under 6% of the Earth's area. To address this issue, the study in [10] proposed a satellite-based terrestrial communication system, namely SatCom. The authors claimed that SatCom is a viable solution for providing seamless network services based on the satellite's capacity, such as high data rate and global coverage. Furthermore, deploying wireless communication systems based on the support of UAVs is also a feasible solution. Thanks to the ability to be flexible and high-speed in moving and adapt to any terrain, UAVs can play a role as base stations to improve performance and extend coverage and energy efficiency. On the other hand, UAVs can serve as terminals in military, agriculture, and disaster response. However, due to resource-constrained UAVs, centralized training deployment of traditional DL techniques is unfeasible. Therefore, the work performed a comprehensive survey on integrating FDL into UAV-based wireless networks. This research shows that this integration can enhance privacy and security, and improve the performance and computational costs of UAVs-enabled wireless networks. Moreover, QFL offers fast model training for SAGINs due to quantum computing. For example, skimmable quantum neural networks (sQNN)-based QFL can enhance model training rates over satellite-ground communications [11]. These networks provide flexible configurations, such as angle and pole, which improve the adaptability of quantum computing. The framework dramatically improves communication capabilities by integrating successive decoding and superposition coding to optimize communication."}, {"title": "III.

FL-based SAGINs in Emergency Response Applications", "content": "In emergency response scenarios such as earthquakes and tsunamis, terrestrial networks are unable to operate properly due to lost connectivity. SAGIN is one of the most viable solutions for establishing communication systems for search, rescue or environmental monitoring. To address this issue, the work in [17] proposed a communication network relying on 6G UAVs, FL, and blockchain for emergency response. To reduce end-to-end delay and energy consumption and enhance security, they estimated the forking event probability and expected energy consumption.

In order to solve the issues of real-time data processing and privacy preservation, this research [18] presents a conceptual framework for smart crowd management in urban areas, utilising edge-assisted federated learning (FL). The suggested framework consists of four layers: application layers, edge computing, cloud computing, and data collecting. The approach improves privacy and security by using federated learning for training and locally processing data on edge devices to reduce risks such as label poisoning attacks in FL-based anomaly detection. Along with the framework's possible answers and practical ramifications, issues including device heterogeneity, user acceptance, scalability, and statutory compliance are explored.

Another important aspect is defining error correction methods to handle quantum noise and decoherence, which are inherent challenges in quantum systems. Standardization allows scale-extended QFL applications across more extensive networks. Moreover, international organizations must collaborate to establish legal and ethical frameworks for using QFL, ensuring data sovereignty and compliance with privacy laws. Standardized metrics for evaluating the performance and accuracy of QFL models can help benchmark their effectiveness. These standards will accelerate the adoption of QFL across sectors such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.

This demographic shift\nhas contributed to a global increase in cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, which\nnow represent considerable public health challenges. Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia, affects\napproximately 1 in 9 people aged 65 and older and was the 5th leading cause of death in this age group in 2021[2].\nDespite advances in medical research, there are still no effective treatments to reverse Alzheimer's disease, making\nprevention and early intervention critical. From a public health perspective, various interventions have been explored to\ndelay the onset of cognitive decline, including lifestyle changes such as physical activity, dietary modifications, and\ncognitive training programs.\nIn this context, cognitive training has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention. This report examines\nthe potential of AI chatbots in enhancing personalized cognitive training for older adults. We propose a chatbot\nframework called ReMe, designed to support episodic memory and open-world cognitive training tasks through\npersonalized interventions."}, {"title": "1.1 Cognitive training", "content": "Cognitive training, also known as brain training, refers to structured programs aimed at improving cognitive functions\nsuch as memory, attention, and reasoning through repeated practice. Just as physical exercise strengthens the body,\ncognitive training exercises the brain, enhancing mental capacities.\nHistorically, cognitive training has been conducted in person, which can be time-consuming and costly. However, with\nadvances in technology, computerized cognitive training (CCT) has gained prominence. Delivered through software\napplications, CCT offers a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional programs. Studies have shown\nthat CCT improves cognitive functions in older adults and holds promise as a preventive strategy against cognitive\ndecline.\nFor example, the large-scale ACTIVE study (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) demon-\nstrated that CCT could improve cognitive functions such as reasoning and processing speed, with effects lasting up to\n10 years[3, 4]. However, the effects of memory training were less durable.\nThe effectiveness of cognitive training largely depends on the domain of the tasks. Systematic reviews have indicated\nthat cognitive training, including CCT, can improve cognitive functions in older adults, including those with mild\ncognitive impairment (MCI)[5]. Research indicates that the effectiveness of cognitive training is domain-specific[6].\nTraining in areas such as memory or attention tends to enhance performance primarily within that domain, although\nthere may be some transfer effects to other cognitive functions.\nDespite its potential, many CCT interventions require supervision from trained professionals, such as clinicians or\ntherapists, to ensure adherence and resolve technical issues. Chan et al. [7] found that supervised CCT led to significant\nimprovements in cognitive functions such as verbal and visual memory, whereas unsupervised CCT showed smaller\nand more limited effects.\nAdherence to cognitive training programs remains a significant challenge, as it directly affects the effectiveness of the\ninterventions.[8]. Some cognitive training tasks were considered monotonous and boring by participants, leading to low\nengagement and motivation [9].\nAnother challenge remains: designing unsupervised tasks that specifically target episodic memory, which is crucial\nfor daily functioning and is one of the earliest cognitive domains affected by Alzheimer's disease. While some\nstudies suggest that process-based training or spatial working memory tasks may transfer to improvements in episodic\nmemory[10, 11], there is still doubt about whether cognitive training can effectively enhance this type of memory[12].\nDesigning interventions that directly target episodic memory, particularly in the context of unsupervised settings,\nremains a significant challenge."}, {"title": "1.2 AI chatbot", "content": "AI chatbots are software programs that simulate human-like conversations using natural language processing (NLP)\ntechnologies. These systems allow users to interact with computers in a conversational manner, typically through text or\nvoice, to fulfill various tasks. Early chatbots were often rule-based, with the rise of large language models (LLMs) like\nGPT-3 and GPT-4 [13, 14], chatbots have evolved into more sophisticated and powerful tools, even there are studies\nclaim that GPT-4 could generate human-like responses in situations that people cannot distinguish between human and\nAI[15, 16].\nIn the healthcare domain, AI chatbots, especially those powered by LLMs like GPT-4, have demonstrated significant\npotential in healthcare, from note-taking to providing medical consultations and more.[17]. In the realm of mental\nhealth, they can provide emotional support, deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy, and monitor patients' mental health\nstatus[18, 19].\nThe unique characteristics of modern AI chatbots make them particularly promising for cognitive training applications:\n\u2022 User-friendly interaction: AI chatbots offer a conversational interface that mimics human dialogue, potentially\nincreasing user engagement and adherence to cognitive training programs, lowering the barrier to use.\n\u2022 Open-world knowledge: Powered by LLMs, these chatbots can engage users in a wide range of topics and\nanswer users' questions in open-ended conversations.\n\u2022 Personalized interventions: By integrating information from various sources, such as user profiles, prefer-\nences, and performance data, chatbots can provide personalized training tasks directly from user's life record\nfor episodic memory and feedback tailored to individual needs."}, {"title": "2 ReMe: a framework for cognitive training chatbot", "content": "To explore and validate the potential of AI chatbots in cognitive training, we developed a framework called ReMe.\nThe primary goal of ReMe is to streamline the development and testing of AI chatbots specifically for personalized\ncognitive training. By providing a simple and user-friendly framework, ReMe enables researchers and developers to\nquickly design, modify, and evaluate cognitive training puzzles and plans, and for further gathering evidence on their\neffectiveness in enhancing cognitive functions.\nThe ReMe framework centers around three key components to support a variety of puzzles: the puzzle engine, the\nlife-logging module, and the training user interface. An overview of the ReMe framework is shown in Fig. 1. The puzzle\nengine generates training instances and manages conversation workflows tailored to cognitive training puzzles. The\nlife-logging module is designed for scenario-based memory training, enabling users to document their daily activities\nand experiences. The training user interface, which includes reusable interaction components, provides an intuitive\nplatform for users to interact with the chatbot, complete puzzles, and receive feedback. Interaction between the user and\nthe chatbot occurs via multimodal input and output, including text, image, and voice, making it adaptable to different\nuser preferences. A set of reusable interactive components supports special interaction and dialogue flow control beyond\nconventional chatbot interactions.\nReMe is implemented as a web-based platform with a back-end server and a front-end interface. The back-end,\ndeveloped using Python and Flask, handles task generation, conversation management, and data storage, while the\nfront-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot,\ncomplete puzzles, and receive feedback."}, {"title": "2.2 Puzzle Engine", "content": "The puzzle engine serves as the core system for generating cognitive training tasks. It organizes puzzles into abstract\ncollections called puzzle groups, which share common objectives and instructions. A puzzle group has a name, an\nprompt template for model inference, an instruction template for the user, and hint template for rules of hint and\ninteraction component if necessary. Utilizing puzzle prototypes and factory functions, the engine streamlines the\ncreation and management of these tasks."}, {"title": "2.3 Life-Logging Module", "content": "For scenario-based memory training, ReMe includes a life-logging module that enables users to document their daily\nactivities and experiences. This module is designed to assist users in recalling and reflecting on their day-to-day\nexperiences, thereby enhancing memory and cognitive function. Users can manually upload entries as life logs,\nincluding text and images. The life-logging module stores these logs and provides a platform for users to review and\nreflect on their experiences. These life logs can serve as a source of personalized training materials for memory training\npuzzles. Data such as timestamps, descriptions, and images are collected and stored in the life-logging module for\nintegration into cognitive training puzzles."}, {"title": "2.4 User Interface", "content": "To accommodate the interaction requirements of different cognitive training tasks, the ReMe framework defines and\nimplements a series of reusable interaction components. The most fundamental of these is the Chat Message, the basic\nunit of conversation for the AI chatbot. A Chat Message contains a set of voice, text, or images, representing the content\nof a single exchange between the user and the AI chatbot. Designed to be model independent, the Chat Message can\nbe converted into the input format required by the model using a converter, ensuring that puzzle definitions remain\nindependent of specific AI model.\nTo support more specialized puzzle interactions, the ReMe framework also defines additional standard components that\ncan be used during interactions. For instance, the draw component: when the system detects this component's keyword\nand parameters in the puzzle response, the user interface will provide a drawing input interaction, allowing users to\ncomplete tasks such as drawing clock hands or dials. Other control flow components include the end component, which\ncan be used to terminate a training session, and the rating component, which provides feedback from the chatbot based\non the user's responses. There is also the hint component, which can display pre-configured multimodal messages such\nas text, images, or audio, allowing for more complex hints to assist the user.\nThese User Interface components are independently defined and reusable. When a puzzle requires a specific component,\nit simply needs to output the corresponding tags and parameters, which will then be automatically translated into the\nappropriate UI elements."}, {"title": "3 Case Study", "content": "Based on the ReMe framework, we implemented several Cognitive training puzzle groups and conducted case studies\nto observe the practical performance of this cognitive training method. For the LLM selection, we chose the GPT-40\nmodel, which possesses sufficiently strong general capabilities and logical reasoning abilities, supports both text and\nimage inputs, and provides rapid responses. To enable voice-based dialogue, we utilized Azure's speech recognition\nand speech synthesis services to convert user inputs and model outputs.\nRegarding prompt design, we manually crafted prompts with reference to the Chain of Thought style.[20]. To enhance\nthe model's understanding of the puzzles and its responsiveness to the current state, we employed the ReAct method in\ndesigning prompts. Specifically, we instructed the model to first summarize and strategize in a non-output, invisible\narea before generating the dialogue output for the user in the visible area[21].\nThe DSM-5 is a pivotal resource in the field of mental health, widely recognized as the authoritative guide for\ndiagnosing and classifying mental disorders. It defines six domains of cognitive function: perceptual-motor function,\nlanguage, executive function, learning and memory, complex attention, and social cognition [22, 23]. Each domain\nencompasses specific subdomains; for instance, learning and memory includes semantic memory, autobiographical\nmemory, procedural memory, and others. This framework can serve as a guide for designing cognitive training puzzles."}, {"title": "3.1 Life Recall", "content": "Life event recall is a puzzle group designed to prompt users to recall specific scenarios previously recorded in a life\nlog. The puzzle engine retrieves information from the life log to create instances that require users to describe various\ndetails of the scenario, including when, where, what, why, who, and how. The AI chatbot verifies the accuracy of the\nuser's responses and encourages further recall. If users struggle to remember certain details, the chatbot can provide\nassistance through textual or image hints. Additionally, throughout the training process, the AI chatbot offers positive\nresponse to motivate users.\nA showcase is presented in Figure 2. The original interactions are conducted via voice, but the figure shows the\ntranscribed text to provide a clearer view of the conversation details. And the image hints for the Life Recall Puzzle are\ndisplayed in the conversation UI of the AI chatbot. This puzzle helps users recall their experiences from the previous\nday, especially what they ate at lunch. Throughout the training process, the AI chatbot guides users in completing their\nmemories and checking the accuracy of what they recall. When users struggle to remember, it can provide textual or\nvisual prompts. In creating these textual hints, we accurately describe the properties of the Lutos root based on image\nrecognition to aid memory retrieval. This example demonstrates how the ReMe Cognitive Training Framework creates\nindividualized training tasks to improve episodic memory using life log data."}, {"title": "3.2 Guessing Word", "content": "The guessing word puzzle group is designed to facilitate open-word language conversation and common sense training.\nInitially, a specific category of words is selected, and a puzzle instance is created. For example, if the chosen category is\nsports, users are asked to guess a specific word, such as \"baseball.\" Users can ask open-ended questions, to which the\nAI chatbot responds exclusively with \"yes\" or \"no.\" Participants must utilize their common sense and language skills to"}, {"title": "3.3 User Study", "content": "We conducted a user study to assess the usability and engagement of two cognitive training puzzles, the Guessing\nWord Puzzle and Life Recall Puzzle, both based on the ReMe cognitive training framework. In this study, participants\nvoluntarily tested the two puzzles on designated devices and provided feedback. The Life Recall Puzzle featured a\npre-set image as a case study, and no identifiable personal information was collected or retained during the study. All\ndata was cleared after the experiment concluded. The study was carried out on World Alzheimer's Day, following a\npublic awareness lecture on Alzheimer's disease for older adults, delivered by volunteer physicians. After the lecture,\nwe introduced the ReMe-based cognitive training tools and provided participants with an opportunity to try them. A\ntotal of 44 participants took part in the study, of which 32 were aged 50 and older, representing the population at risk.\nTheir feedback was then analyzed.\nOf the participants, 84.38% had at least a high school education, 37.5% were on daily medication for chronic conditions,\nand 75% reported using their mobile phone for more than two hours per day. Furthermore, 25% had previous experience\nwith cognitive training software, and half of these individuals found the interfaces of previous tools unfriendly.\nRegarding difficulty, 81.25% of participants rated both puzzles as moderately challenging (2-4 on a 5-point scale). In\nterms of engagement, 71.88% found the Guessing Word Puzzle enjoyable, while 75.00% reported the same for the Life\nRecall Puzzle (scoring 3 or higher on a 5-point scale). Furthermore, 81. 25% of the participants felt that the interaction\nwith both puzzles was smooth and intuitive (2-4 on a 5-point scale)."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "This report presents the ReMe framework and demonstrates its potential in personalized cognitive training. Through the\ntwo case studies, ReMe has shown its strengths in cognitive training tasks. In the \"Life Event Recall\" case study, the\ntask of recalling what the user ate the previous day helps engage users in episodic memory exercises. By guiding users\nto retrieve real-life details, the task train their memory capability in unsupervised settings where users can complete\ntasks through interaction with ReMe. The personalized nature of these training tasks leverages users' everyday life\ninformation, providing a tailored training experience for each individual.\nAdditionally, the open-world riddle task showcases ReMe's ability to facilitate open-ended interactions. In this task,\nusers can ask open-ended questions while the AI responds with \"yes/no\" answers, challenging users' reasoning and\ndivergent thinking. It offers a flexible training experience.\nSupported by large language models (LLMs), the AI chatbot can engage in human-like dialogue, making the interaction\nfeel more natural. This friendly, human-like interaction greatly enhances user engagement and adherence to the training,\nreducing resistance to cognitive training and creating a more relaxed environment for users."}, {"title": "4.2 Limitations", "content": "While the ReMe framework demonstrates the potential of AI chatbots in cognitive training, we recognize several current\nlimitations.\nFirstly, although chatbot interaction lowers usage barriers, some elderly individuals may still face challenges even with\nvoice-based interaction. Turn-based interaction with AI chatbots is not as natural as talking to a real person. Initial\ntraining and ongoing support may be necessary to ensure users can fully utilize the system's functions.\nSecondly, high-quality interactions require powerful language models. This not only increases the system's complexity\nand cost but may also introduce inference latency issues, affecting user experience. Optimizing system latency remains\na significant technical challenge.\nLastly, while our case studies show promising results, more evidence is needed to confirm the direct training effects of\nAI chatbots on episodic memory and other fields. The short-term and long-term effects and transfer effects of cognitive\ntraining also require further investigation."}, {"title": "4.3 Risks", "content": "Additionally, there are several risks that should be considered.\nOn one hand, since personalized cognitive training through life event recall involves extensive user life logs, privacy\nprotection and data security must be handled with extra caution during practical implementation. Ensuring that sensitive\npersonal data is securely stored and managed is crucial, as any breach could compromise user trust and well-being.\nMoreover, with AI chatbots powered by large language models, there is a risk of generating hallucinated outputs,\nincorrect or misleading information that may not align with reality. This could potentially affect the quality of the\ncognitive training, as users might rely on inaccurate responses. Therefore, careful management and filtering of generated\ncontent are necessary to mitigate the risk of adverse effects on training outcomes.\nFurthermore, although AI chatbots driven by large language models can provide empathetic response and encouragement,\nthere is also a potential risk of users developing emotional dependence on chatbot interactions. This could lead to a\ndecrease in social activity or interactions with other people. It's important to assess whether prolonged engagement\nwith the chatbot could negatively impact users' real-world social behavior.\nBefore large-scale deployment, these risks must be carefully evaluated and managed to ensure the safe and effective use\nof the AI chatbot as a cognitive training tool."}, {"title": "4.4 Future Work", "content": "Looking ahead, we plan to optimize both the AI chatbot framework and the puzzle designs to enhance the user\nexperience. One key area of improvement is reducing inference latency, especially introducing models which can\nnatively accept voice inputs and provide natural voice responses, which will make the interaction smoother and more\nresponsive to user queries. We also aim to expand the variety of training tasks to offer users more diverse cognitive\nchallenges, thus enriching the training experience.\nFurthermore, we intend to collaborate with cognitive science researchers to conduct more extensive validation studies.\nThese comprehensive investigations will enable us to gather more robust evidence on the efficacy of AI chatbot cognitive\ntraining, particularly in enhancing episodic memory. By expanding the scale of our experiments, we aim to substantiate\nthe viability of AI chatbots like ReMe as an effective cognitive training method. Moreover, beyond cognitive training,\nthis framework shows promise for other intervention domains that can be addressed through dialogue, including\nsubstance addiction treatment, depression management, and cognitive-behavioral interventions for individuals with\nautism.\nThe potential applications of this technology are promising, and as we continue to refine and validate our approach,\nwe hope to contribute to advancements in personalized digital health interventions. This research may pave the way\nfor innovative therapeutic tools and could potentially open up new avenues for supporting mental health and cognitive\nwell-being for a wider population."}]}

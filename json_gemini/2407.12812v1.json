Budgets for research and development have been steadily\ngrowing with the US government alone reaching over 700 billion dollars in 2020 [Anderson et al.,\n2023]. However, to have impact, a scientific result needs to be communicated effectively [Weiss, 1975,\n1979, Gluckman and Wilsdon, 2016, Wilsdon et al., 2014, Elliott et al., 2021]. Today, the way science\nis communicated often results in isolated monoliths of evidence, including papers, proceedings,\npresentations, and datasets, which are detached from the real-world situations and questions that\ncould benefit from their insights. While there are ways for decision makers to request and receive\nadvice from the scientists, they are not straightforward [Gluckman et al., 2021]. We present a\nframework for the use of large language models (LLMs) in Building Understandable Messaging for\nPolicy and Evidence Review (BUMPER). BUMPER utilizes a reactive chat interface to bridge the\ngap between individual scientific studies and their application in, for example, policy. BUMPER\nis not meant to generate new evidence by, e.g., functional search [Romera-Paredes et al., 2024] or\nsynthesis [Zheng et al., 2023]; rather, it is a translational tool for existing evidence. It features a\nnovel compliance score and, unlike many popular tools today, establishes clear ownership, enabling\naccountability and keeping the scientist \"in the loop\". BUMPER has the potential to empower\npolicymakers to more effectively use evidence and data in their decision-making processes.\nWho is at fault if you build a clock and give it to someone seeking a compass, only for them to later\nwander in circles? The process of transferring science to decision making wrestles with this problem:\nwhat mechanisms can ensure that the right information is incorporated into the right application? To\naddress this key issue, BUMPER is more than just a chatbot. It introduces innovative, scope-limiting\nand transparent checks that are defined by the scientists, while also ensuring clear attribution and\nownership. Unlike many other guardrail architectures [Rajpal, 2024, Inan et al., 2023, Rebedea et al.,\n2023, Goyal et al., 2024, Dong et al., 2024], BUMPER does not directly affect the output by e.g.,\nfiltering or iteration. We argue this pattern promotes trustworthiness and show case studies from a\nreal-world disease modeling analysis and a toy-model.\nLLMs promise to transform scientific knowledge transfer by allowing users to pose questions or\ndescribe scenarios in familiar language rather than navigating an ever-expanding sea of evidence and\ntechnical lingo Lewis et al. [2021]. However, these models, already in active use, pose challenges\nrelated to access, trustworthiness, and accountability [Bommasani et al., 2022]. In particular, LLMs\u2019\ndemonstrated predilection for hallucination is significant concern regarding their use in high-stakes\napplications [Adlakha et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2022, Muhlgay et al., 2024, Li et al., 2023]. Decision\nmaking is one arena where, even the occasional failure, can have severe consequences across the\nsystem impacting not only high-impact issues, but also trust and relations between scientists and\ndecision makers. While the problem of LLM hallucinations remains an unsolved challenge, the\nBUMPER framework offers a promising and novel path forward in the scientific discourse surrounding\nhow we, as a global society, can safely harness the potential LLMs offer. Our contributions include:\n\u2022 Demonstrating how LLMs can be used for scientific evidence synthesis while maintaining\ndirect association and ownership with the scientists\n\u2022 Formalizing a compliance score to assess performance and trustworthiness\n\u2022 Establishing methods to characterize the stability of the framework\n\u2022 Prototyping code and case studies to enable scientists to explore this space\nIn this paper we first describe the BUMPER framework, highlighting its novel features as well as\npotential in the space of evidence translation. We then demonstrate the framework first with a simple\nexample of a model for rugby team performance and second a real-world application for health policy\nwith a model of measles seasonality and susceptibility. We conclude with a discussion."}, {"title": "2 Framework", "content": "Decision makers have questions, concerns, and pressures. Scientists produce analyses with results,\nassumptions, and limitations. The role of BUMPER is to bridge the two via natural language and a\nwell-defined, purposeful architecture.\nThe scientist begins with a set of assets composing the knowledge base, $K$, and designs a set of actions,\n$A = (a_0,...,a_j)$. Each action, $a_i$, takes a subset of $K$ as inputs along with other optional argument.\nThe outputs of each $a_i$ is information derived from the knowledge base and potentially relevant to\nthe user. Lastly, the scientist must supply guidelines $G$ composed of criteria, $C = (c_0, ..., c_n)$, and\ntopics, $T = (t_0, ..., t_M)$. With these elements, evidence is synthesized in 6 steps: 1) A question\nfrom the user is passed to an LLM. 2) The LLM is used to identify which subset of actions, $a_i \\in A$,\nare relevant. 3) The actions are executed and results are aggregated to synthesize an answer using\nthe LLM. 4) Another LLM instance is used test whether the answer complies with the guidelines, $G$\nand produces a score. 5) The answer and score are returned to the user. Illustrated in Figure 1, the\nBUMPER workflow steps 1-5 are:\n1) User interaction: The user interacts with BUMPER in a prompt-reply loop or chat format. The text\nfrom a user's prompts and the BUMPER responses are stored in a thread that both the user and LLM\nhave access to (see Figure 3 for an example). Areas of interest a user might have include: methods,\nscope, risk, comparisons, counterfactuals, situational estimation, financials/cost, and prioritization.\nHowever, not all of these topics will be appropriate for any single BUMPER knowledge base. The\nrole of the guidelines in step 5 is to flag when a synthesized answer lies out of scope.\n2) Action identification: To create a BUMPER associated with a scientific analysis, the scientist\nidentifies components of their work that may be relevant to decision makers. For example, this may\nbe particular pieces of documentation, calculations, or simulation results. For each piece, the scientist\ncreates a function whose output is input for the LLM. This is most likely, but not limited to, text and\nthe functions can vary widely from a table lookup to running code [Google, OpenAI]. In addition\nthe functions, the scientist also provides a description of the function describing its purpose and\nproviding context for understanding the result. This meta-data provides the context for matching\nfunctions to a query.\nThe task of matching actions can be solved in a variety of ways and, under the umbrella term \"agents\"\n[Xi et al., 2023], and is an area of rapid development. In our examples we use OpenAI's assistants\nAPI which is a black box regarding how the matching is done. However, there do exist open-source\nmethods combining LLMs with tasks that may extend to this problem [e.g., TALM, PAL, ReAct;\nParisi et al., 2022, Gao et al., 2023, Yao et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2023, Aksitov et al., 2023].\n3) Knowledge retrieval and aggregation: The results of the selected actions, along with the function\nmeta-data, are aggregated to provide context for answering the original question using an LLM. The\nresulting outpus is the synthesized evidence, E.\n4/5) Evidence scoring and output: The final step involves generating a flag (pass/fail) and a white-box\nscore, S, to indicate whether and how well the answer aligns with the intended purpose of the original\nknowledge base, K. Using an LLM (without the original context), the synthesized evidence is\ncompared against the criteria and topics that make up the guidelines. The criteria list the requirements\nthat must be met (e.g., do not provide financial estimates), while the topics further limit the scope of\nthe answer (e.g., methodology). See case studies for further details with context.\nTo distinguish between confidence in the correctness of the synthesized answer and confidence in\nwhether the answer is in-scope, we utilise a compliance score S. To generate S, where $S \\in [0, 1]$, we\ntake the LLM-generated output from the guideline check and de-compose it into its individual tokens\n(alpha-numeric combinations that concatenate into the output text). For a given input to the LLM, G,\neach returned token has a probability $P_T(G)$ given the previous tokens $T = 0, 1, . . ., T \u2013 1$. The\nprobability of the first token $P_0$ is a proxy for confidence [Guo et al., 2017, Malinin and Gales, 2021,\nJiang et al., 2021, Kadavath et al., 2022]. We focus on two ways to compute S:\n1. A single simultaneous assessment of all the guidelines, $S = P_0$\n2. Combining assessments of the guideline components:\n$S = \\prod_{i=0}^{N} P_0(c_i) \\times \\prod_{i=0}^{M} [1-1 (1-P_0(t_i)) ]$ (1)\nWe find that combining assessments of the guideline elements tends to be more consistent over\nmultiple iterations with lower compliance scores. This result is consistent with previous studies\nshowing that while LLMs tend to be overconfident when verbalizing their confidence [Xiong et al.,\n2024] there exist techniques for addressing this issue. See section 4 for examples and further"}, {"title": "3 Synthesizing evidence: six nations rugby championship example", "content": "We use a tutorial from PyMC as a first demonstration and template for interested users (see appendix\nA.1). The tutorial describes a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze and predict outcomes of a rugby\ntournament (the Six Nations Championship) [Coyle et al., Baio and Blangiardo, 2010]. In rugby, two\nteams play against each other, running with the ball in hand. An \u201coffense\u201d or \u201cattack\u201d by one team\nagainst their opponent is met by a \"defense\". The strength of an offense, in rugby, means how well\nthe team is able attack the opponent. Historical home and away scores are modeled using a log-linear\nrandom effects model with parameters capturing both the attack and defensive strengths of the teams.\nFor this BUMPER example, we constructed two functions to access the estimated attack and\ndefensive strengths of each team, similar to a database query. In Figure 2, we demonstrate how this\nBUMPER performs against ChatGPT4 with the tutorial as context. 4 The user query for this example\nis: \"Which team has the second worst attack?\". BUMPER provides an answer with specificity and\nclearly related to the provided evidence (e.g., using the estimated model parameters) while ChatGPT4\nincorrectly hedges its answer."}, {"title": "4 Towards trustworthiness: a case study for health policy", "content": "LLMs are fast evolving into tools that exhibit many of the human-like characteristics that encourage\ntrust and engagement: memory, speech, and multi-modal capability [ope, b,a]. However, while\nthese models may affect trust, they have not earned it. In their study establishing trustworthiness\nbenchmarks, Sun et al. [Sun et al., 2024] compare measures of trustworthiness to measures of utility.\nWe contend that in high-stakes situations, trustworthiness is essential for utility. If you cannot trust\na tool, how can you rely on it for critical tasks? We will demonstrate how BUMPER designs for\ntrustworthiness by applying our framework to an existing, open-source model that estimates the\nseasonal patterns and outbreak potential for measles [Thakkar et al., 2024b].\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease that has a safe and highly effective vaccine [Moss and Strebel,\n2023]. Currently the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that every child receive a dose\nof the measles containing vaccine (MCV) as part of a routine childhood vaccination program but\nthere are many places where the fraction of children who receive this vaccine fall far short of WHO\ntargets (95%) [WHO/UNICEF, 2023]. In some places, particularly where measles is a constant threat,\ncountries chose to run time-limited, age-targeted supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), or\nvaccination campaigns. These activities, in conjunction with routine childhood vaccinations, have\nproven to be an essential tool in avoiding large, catastrophic measles outbreaks [WHO, 2016, Thakkar\net al., 2024a].\nPlanning and executing an SIA is challenging and requires coordination at multiple levels of gov-\nernment, attainment of funds from various sources, and management of resources and people.\nGovernment officials are key decision makers. Evidence in the form of monitoring, modelling, and\nand guidelines can help ensure that these campaigns are effective at stopping devastating measles\noutbreaks [Verguet et al., 2015, WHO, 2016]. One important consideration is the timing of, or when,\nan SIA should occur. Timing can be roughly broken down into what year, dictated by the build up\nof susceptible individuals, and what month, driven by the well-known seasonality of transmission.\nPlans are determined by individual countries informed by detailed transmission models [Thakkar\net al., 2019, Zimmermann et al., 2019] or heuristics [Verguet et al., 2015, WHO, 2016]. The analysis\nwe chose for this example uses historical measles cases to estimate country-specific seasonality and\nrelative susceptibility (see 3).\nThe example's body of evidence is composed of executable code and a paper (see table 3in appendix\nA.2). The code is written in python and fast enough to real in real-time. We wrote wrapper\nfunctions around python scripts available on GitHub to generate country-specific estimates of:\n1) low transmission months, 2) high transmission months, 3) months to run SIAs, and 4) relative\nsusceptibility. For questions regarding methodology we create a separate assistant (see Figure 1)\nthat handles the vector-database query. This allows additional prompt engineering and document\ntargeting not otherwise available through the OpenAI API. Figure 3 provides an example comparing\nthe synthesized, textual evidence provided by BUMPER with visual evidence that might be found in\nsupplementary material or a dashboard.\nThe guidelines are listed in appendix A.3. BUMPER uses an LLM to determine whether the\nsynthesized evidence is consistent with this statement of purpose (see Figure 1) and records the token"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "There exist many methods and tools that can query large, multi-modal, databases [Pietsch et al., 2019,\nLiu, 2022] and they continue to innovate on, for example, extending attention beyond fixed context\nwindows [Dai et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2022, Munkhdalai et al., 2024] and improvements upon the RAG\nschema [Glass et al., 2022, Asai et al., 2023, Yan et al., 2024]. These tools are increasingly capable in\ntheir ability to ingest any type of media, demonstrating both the exciting potential for communicating\ninformation irrespective of medium. There is a rapidly growing body of work applying such tools\nto scientific knowledge extraction and synthesis [Wang et al., 2024, Susnjak et al., 2024]. However,\nthese studies usually emphasize how to build tools that perform across a field of research. This work\npresents the BUMPER framework as a tool to be incorporated into and enhance a single study, with\nthe creators retaining clear ownership, enabling accountability and keeping the scientist \u201cin the loop\".\nWe introduce a framework for facilitating knowledge transfer through the use of LLMs between\nscientists and decision-makers called the Building Understandable Messaging for Policy and Evidence\nReview (BUMPER) framework. BUMPER has several novel features. First, it establishes clear\nownership which enables accountability and a simple method for feedback and improvements.\nSecond, it is limited in it scope due to a limited set of actions (e.g., text search, running code, database\naccess) and post-hoc evaluation. Other various guardrail architectures are well into development, but\none distinctive element of our proposed solution is that it builds the checks around the synthesized\nevidence, rather than around the original prompt or LLM. Additionally, it has the potential to help\nincrease accessibility as a digital product and multi-lingual operation. Lastly, because BUMPER does\nnot rely on fine-tuning [c.f. Zhang et al., 2024] it has the potential to scale: with the development\nof standards and increasing the availability of compute and tools, it would be possible to combing\nmultiple BUMPERs into an engine capable of synthesizing from many independent sources.\nA critical challenge associated with BUMPER, and any tool that tries to use automated evidence\ngeneration, is the potential loss of human to human interaction. Translating science to policy\nwell depends on the context which can often only be understood by establishing and maintaining\nrelationships [Connelly et al., 2021]. Therefore it is critical that these tools, while they may reduce\nsome human-to-human interaction, are not taken to be strict replacements. Instead, there are some\nclear design choices that could potentially increase the quality and availability of relations between\nscientists and decision makers. For example, attributable and interactive tools can foster follow-up\nand engagement [e.g., Dontcheva et al., 2014]."}, {"title": "A Appendix / supplemental material", "content": "A.1 Getting started\nWe implemented BUMPER using python and provide the code so that interested individuals can try\nthis framework.

Planning SIAs during the low transmission season\ncan be strategically advantageous for controlling the spread of measles effectively.\n\u2022 (S = 0.99)| Cameroon should plan to conduct Supplementary Immunization Activities\n(SIAs) during the months of July and August. These months also overlap with the low\ntransmission season for measles, which runs from March to July, making it an opportune\ntime to conduct SIAs and prevent outbreaks. Additionally, these months are outside of the\nhigh transmission season, which occurs from January and then again from September to\nDecember.\n\u2022 (S = 0.92)| In Cameroon, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) are recommended\nto occur in July and August. During these months, measles transmission is in a low season,\nwhich includes March through July, making it an advantageous period for implementing\nSIAs to ensure higher coverage and possibly lower transmission risks. The high transmission\nmonths for measles in Cameroon are January, September, October, November, and December.\nPlanning SIAs during the low transmission season helps in interrupting the transmission of\nmeasles more effectively.\n\u2022 (S = 0.95)| In Cameroon, the recommended months to plan Supplementary Immunization\nActivities (SIAs) for measles are July and August.

The high transmission months for measles are January,\nSeptember, October, November, and December. Conversely, the low transmission months\nare between March and July.

During this period, measles transmission is historically\nlow (in March, April, May, June, and July), which can facilitate the execution of SIAs by\nminimizing the risk of disease spread during the campaigns.\nThe high transmission months for measles in Cameroon are January, September, October,\nNovember, and December. Planning SIAs outside these months might help in avoiding peak\ntransmission times, which aligns with the recommended July and August timeframe.\nForecast data on relative susceptibility, a proxy for the risk of measles outbreaks, suggests\nfluctuating levels through the upcoming months and years. However, the forecast indicates\nthe susceptibility is below 1 until around November 2024, suggesting a lower-than-average\nrisk of measles outbreaks leading up to this point. Beyond November 2024, susceptibility\ngradually increases, suggesting the risk of outbreaks may become higher than average,\nreinforcing the importance of conducting SIAs before this projected increase in susceptibility.\nIt is crucial to plan SIAs during periods that align with low transmission times and take into\naccount future susceptibility forecasts to mitigate the risk of measles outbreaks effectively.\n\u2022 (S = 0.97)| For Cameroon, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) are recom-\nmended to occur in July and August. This is based on available data and aims to achieve\noptimal impact by timing these activities strategically.\nLooking at measles transmission patterns in Cameroon, the high transmission months are\nJanuary, and September through December. This period presents a higher risk for measles\nspread. Conversely, the low transmission months, which are considered a more optimal time\nfor conducting SIAs due to lower measles activity, are March through July.\nThe forecast for relative susceptibility, which serves as a proxy for the risk of measles\noutbreaks, indicates that the relative susceptibility is currently below 1 but is predicted\nto gradually increase over time. By late 2024 and into 2025, the susceptibility index\nincreases, suggesting a higher-than-average risk of measles outbreaks in these future periods.\nThis underlines the importance of planning SIAs accordingly to preemptively tackle this\nanticipated increase in measles outbreak risk.\nGiven this information, planning SIAs for July and August aligns with the low transmission\nseason, potentially increasing the effectiveness of these campaigns. Additionally, considering\nthe rising susceptibility forecast, conducting SIAs in these months might also contribute to\nmitigating the impact of the increasing outbreak risk in the forthcoming periods.\n\u2022 (S = 0.98)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) in July\nand August. During these months, measles transmission is generally low, which aligns with\nthe recommendation for conducting SIAs.\nThe measles transmission in Cameroon is high during January, September, October, Novem-\nber, and December. The low transmission months are March through July, which align\nperfectly with the recommended SIA months of July and August.\nThe future relative susceptibility forecast indicates that the risk of measles outbreaks in-\ncreases gradually from February 2024 onwards, peaking towards the end of 2025. This\nforecast suggests that planning SIAs before this upward trend in susceptibility becomes\nsignificant could be beneficial in mitigating the risk of outbreaks.\nConsidering the susceptibility forecast and the seasonal pattern of measles transmission,\nconducting SIAs in July and August would strategically precede the upcoming high trans-\nmission season and increased susceptibility, potentially reducing measles transmission and\noutbreak risk.\n\u2022 (S = 0.99)| For Cameroon, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) are recom-\nmended to occur in July and August. Analyzing the measles transmission patterns and future\nsusceptibility to outbreaks can inform the best timing for these activities:\n**High transmission months** are January, September, October, November, and December.\n**Low transmission months** include March, April, May, June, and July, aligning partly\nwith the recommended SIA months of July and August.\nThe susceptibility forecast indicates that the risk of a measles outbreak is comparatively\nlower until approximately November 2024, after which the relative susceptibility increases,\nindicating a higher than average risk of measles outbreaks.\nGiven these factors: - Conducting SIAs in July and August leverages the period of lower\nmeasles transmission, which could help in reaching more children before the susceptibil-\nity-and potentially the transmission\u2014increases. - Planning SIAs before the forecasted\nincrease in susceptibility could also mitigate the risk of larger outbreaks, particularly before\nthe high transmission season resumes in September.\nThus, Cameroon should prioritize planning and executing SIAs during July and August,\naligning with the recommendations and considering the forecasted susceptibility to measles\noutbreaks to ensure efficacy.\n\u2022 (S = 0.99)| For Cameroon, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for measles are\nrecommended to occur in July and August. This planning aligns with the low transmission\nseason for measles in Cameroon, which occurs in March, April, May, June, and July,\npotentially reducing the spread during SIAs.\nThe measles transmission is high from January and then again from September through\nDecember. The susceptibility forecast indicates a relative susceptibility below 1 until\nNovember 2024, suggesting the risk of a measles outbreak is lower than average until this\ntime. However, starting from November 2024, the relative susceptibility begins to increase,\nsuggesting that post-November 2024, the risk of measles outbreaks becomes higher than\naverage.\nGiven this information, conducting SIAs in July and August is strategically aligned with\nboth the recommended months and a period of lower measles transmission, while also\nanticipating an increase in outbreak risk later in the year.\ncluster:C4\n\u2022 (S = -0.54)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for\nmeasles in July and August.\n\u2022 (S = 0.63)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for\nmeasles in July and August.\n\u2022 (S = -0.82)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for\nmeasles in July and August.\n\u2022 (S = 0.36)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for\nmeasles in July and August.\n\u2022 (S = -0.37)| Cameroon should plan Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) for\nmeasles in July and August."}]}

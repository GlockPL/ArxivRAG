However, real-world research and development often require solving complex, interdisciplinary challenges where solutions may not be readily found through existing knowledge related to the problem. Therefore, it is desirable to leverage the vast, comprehensive knowledge of LLMs to generate effective, breakthrough solutions by integrating various perspectives from other disciplines. Here, we propose SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), a framework leveraging LLMs and structured guidance using MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles, such as International Patent Classification (IPC) and the periodic table of elements. SELLM systematically constructs comprehensive expert agents from the list to generate cross-disciplinary and effective solutions. To evaluate SELLM's practicality, we applied it to two challenges: improving light extraction in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting and developing electrodes for next-generation memory materials. The results demonstrate that SELLM significantly facilitates the generation of effective solutions compared to cases without specific customization or effort, showcasing the potential of SELLM to enable LLMs to generate effective solutions even for challenging problems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction:", "content": "In recent years, various methods leveraging large language models (LLMs)1\u20133 for generating research ideas 4-7, solutions, and hypotheses9-11 to solve specific problems\u2014traditionally performed by humans\u2014have been actively studied and developed. To enable problem-solving based on specialized knowledge, approaches including fine-tuning with domain-specific datasets12,13 and utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)8,14,15 have been explored to enhance expertise. Furthermore, research has also explored enhancing the diversity and feasibility of generated solutions by facilitating interactions between multiple expert models with domain-specific knowledge6,16,17. The applications of LLM-based approaches have also been reported in the fields of materials science and materials development18,19. Additionally, there are reports of using knowledge graphs to harness networks of specialized knowledge for generating research ideas and hypotheses5,20. More recently, studies have even demonstrated the ability to draft entire research papers using such techniques21.\nHowever, the development of advanced methodologies for generating effective solutions to intrinsically challenging problems is still in its early stages. By \u201cintrinsically challenging problems,\" we refer to issues that require the skillful integration of knowledge and methodology from seemingly unrelated fields to address effective solutions. Prominent examples of such problems and their solutions include CRISPR-Cas922 for genetic engineering23 (Nobel Prize 2020), Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)24 for live-cell imaging25 (Nobel Prize 2008), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) for brain activity mapping26-28. The application of Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) technology from flat panel displays to Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM)29,30, which is treated as a target problem in this study, also serves as a representative example of such challenges. Addressing these types of problems is not straightforward with existing methodologies, because identifying the appropriate domain of expertise distant from the target problem is inherently difficult. Some approaches have been proposed to utilize knowledge from fields distant from the target problem15,20; however, the challenge of missing critical knowledge or fields essential for problem-solving has not been sufficiently addressed.\nIn this study, we propose a brute-force approach called SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), designed to generate valuable solutions to inherently challenging problems using LLMs. The core principle of SELLM is to construct a comprehensive set of domain-specific \"experts\" using LLMs, with each expert proposing specialized solutions from the perspective of its respective field. If a comprehensive set of experts with appropriate granularity is established, it becomes possible to generate effective solutions that leverage seemingly unrelated knowledge and methodologies, without omissions. To achieve them, SELLM utilizes structured lists of MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principles, such as the International Patent Classification (IPC) system or the periodic table of elements, to generate solutions that incorporate domain-specific expertise."}, {"title": "2. Result", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we applied SELLM to two challenging problems: improving light extraction in organic light emitting diode (OLED) lighting31,32 and developing electrodes for next-generation memory materials30. It should be noted that while the solutions to these problems may seem straightforward once presented, coming up with them requires significant expertise of different fields, making these inherently challenging problems. We demonstrated that SELLM, by utilizing IPC subclass lists and chemical element lists, facilitates the generation of effective solutions compared to cases where no specific customization or effort is applied. These results highlight the potential of effectively leveraging LLMs to propose essential solutions by integrating knowledge from seemingly unrelated fields."}, {"title": "2.1. Overview of the proposed method and evaluation strategy", "content": "Figure 1 illustrates the framework of SELLM. The input consists of a description of the problem to be solved and a list of knowledge elements with explanations for each element. The list is expected to maintain an appropriate level of granularity suitable for its field of expertise while ensuring sufficiently broad coverage. Additionally, minimizing overlap between elements helps to avoid unnecessary redundancy. Subsequently, an expert is generated for each element using the technique of role-play prompting\u00b3\u00b3 from the provided list. These experts generate solutions to the given problem based on their respective expertise. Further details are provided in the Methods section.\nTo assess the appropriateness of the generated solutions, three evaluation methods are employed: similarity-based evaluation (SBE), keyword-based evaluation (KBE), and human-based evaluation (HBE). In SBE, leveraging the LLM-as-a-Judge34 approach, the similarity between the generated solutions and the \u201creference solution\", which is described in the literature, is rated on a scale from 1 to 10. For KBE, key terms essential to problem-solving are scored by counting the occurrence of these terms. In HBE, some of the solutions with diverse SBE scores are further evaluated by human experts to determine whether they constitute genuinely effective solutions, irrespective of alignment with the reference solution. The details are described in the Methods section.\nHere, we introduce two challenging problems addressed in this study and their respective solutions briefly. The first problem is the efficient extraction of light from OLED devices used for\""}, {"title": "2.2. Generating solutions to the light extraction problem in OLED lighting", "content": "We conducted a validation to evaluate SELLM's capability to generate solutions for the light extraction problem. The problem statement, reference solution, and keywords are provided in Table 1, while the list of subclasses from the IPC sections B, C, F, G, and H was used. For comparison, solutions were generated using the same problem statement without any specific adjustments (Standard). Considering the balance between performance and cost, OpenAI's gpt-40-2024-08-06 (GPT-40) as an representative LLM was utilized for the generation of experts and solutions. Details of the explanatory descriptions and generation conditions are described in the Methods section."}, {"title": "2-3 Generating solutions to the problem of contact resistance in IGZO-TFT", "content": "Figure 4 illustrates the solution generation results for the challenge in IGZO-TFT using SELLM. The problem statement is provided in Table 4, and the lists used include subclasses from the IPC classes B, C, F, G, and H, as well as a list of 83 elements ranging from hydrogen to bismuth. GPT-40 was also used for the generation of experts and solutions, considering the balance between performance and cost. Figures 4a and 4b show the distribution of evaluation scores for SBE and KBE, respectively. The correct solutions for SBE and the keywords for KBE are detailed in Table 4. From Figure 4a, it is evident that the maximum SBE score for the Standard approach is 4, whereas SELLM successfully generates solutions with significantly higher scores. Moreover, the element list tends to produce higher-scoring solutions compared to the IPC subclass list. Similarly, Figure 4b indicates that SELLM generates solutions with higher KBE scores, further suggesting that the element list is more effective than the IPC subclass list, as seen in the SBE results. Examples of generated solutions with high SBE and KBE scores are shown in Table 5. These results indicate that SELLM is also effective in addressing the problem of contact resistance in IGZO-TFTs, as it generates solutions close to the reference solution."}, {"title": "3. Discussion & Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we developed and evaluated SELLM (Solution Enumeration via comprehensive List and LLM), a framework designed to generate solutions to intrinsically challenging problems by leveraging LLMs. By employing structured lists, such as IPC subclasses and chemical elements, SELLM creates domain-specific experts capable of addressing problems that require the integration of knowledge from diverse fields. We demonstrated the effectiveness of SELLM in solving two complex challenges: light extraction in OLED lighting and contact resistance in IGZO-based TFTs. The results demonstrated that SELLM generated solutions with higher SBE and KBE scores compared to the solutions generated without specific adjustments. Furthermore, expert evaluations confirmed that SELLM produced valuable solutions, including promising alternatives not documented in the existing literature. These findings suggest that SELLM has the potential to address inherently challenging problems by integrating domain knowledge comprehensively and systematically. Moreover, the results of this study also suggest that, even without complementing LLMs with external domain-specific knowledge through methods like RAG or fine-tuning, it is possible to generate high-quality, specialized solutions by effectively utilizing the knowledge already stored within LLMs. Even if the solutions generated are not perfect, presenting a list of possible solutions can inspire human users, spark new ideas, and help refine or develop incomplete ideas further.\nSELLM relates to existing research on leveraging LLMs for hypothesis generation, problem-solving, and knowledge integration but adopts a distinct approach. While previous studies have demonstrated the utility of fine-tuning1,12,13 and RAG8,14 to enhance domain expertise, SELLM introduces an innovative methodology by systematically applying MECE principles to construct comprehensive expert lists. Unlike previous approaches that focus on individual domains or limited interactions between expert models6,16, SELLM generates exhaustive and diverse solutions that connect seemingly unrelated fields. This study complements and extends recent advancements in LLM-based problem-solving18,20 by addressing the limitations in generating solutions for intrinsically challenging problems that require the integration of distant knowledge.\nFrom the perspective of hypothesis construction, this study is closely aligned with Charles Peirce's concept of abduction, also referred to as retroduction44\u201346. Abduction, as defined by Peirce, is the process of forming plausible hypotheses to explain or address a phenomenon. Our results"}, {"title": "4. Methods", "content": "demonstrate that, by providing structured guidance, SELLM can generate a multitude of hypotheses, including useful solutions, which align with Peirce's framework of abduction. Nevertheless, as Peirce emphasized, abduction involves not only the generation of hypotheses but also their refinement to identify the most valuable ones from a broad pool of candidates. While SELLM succeeds in generating a comprehensive set of hypotheses, it does not yet adequately address the critical process of narrowing these down to the most beneficial solutions.\nClosely related to the previous discussion, one limitation of SELLM is its tendency to generate redundant or irrelevant ideas due to the exhaustive nature of its approach. While this redundancy may be inherent to the process of fostering innovative ideas, it poses a substantial obstacle in practical applications. Currently, SELLM lacks built-in mechanisms to filter out less viable ideas, leaving this task to human experts or subsequent analytical tools. Future research should focus on developing efficient methods to evaluate and rank the generated solutions, reducing noise while preserving the breadth of innovation.\nA key advantage of SELLM lies in its ability to control solution generation by selecting appropriate lists, such as company-specific technologies or laboratory resources. This flexibility enables tailored applications across industries and research domains. For instance, SELLM could be used to identify potential uses for proprietary materials, suggest applications for underutilized technologies, or explore new combinations of available resources. In addition, integrating advanced filtering mechanisms and interactive feedback loops with human experts could further enhance SELLM's utility."}, {"title": "4.1 Lists of specific knowledge and their explanations", "content": "SELLM generates a list of experts from a list of terms consisting of concepts and domain knowledge and outputs solutions using the expert list. The list of knowledge and concepts must be sufficiently comprehensive and appropriately granular to include concepts that contribute to the solution generation. Additionally, excessive overlap between concepts in a list can lead to redundant and similar responses. Therefore, a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) list is desirable whenever possible.\nIn this study, we utilized a list of subclasses from the International Patent Classification (IPC) and a list of chemical elements. The IPC is a representative system for structurally organizing technologies across various fields, providing a sufficiently comprehensive and non-overlapping list of technologies. The patent classification consists of sections A through H. While it is possible to use all sections and subclasses, we selected sections B (performing operations; transporting), C (chemistry; metallurgy), F (mechanical engineering; lighting; heating; weapons; blasting), G (physics), and H (electricity) to consider computational cost.

For the list of chemical elements, we used the 83 element symbols from hydrogen (element number 1) to bismuth (element number 83), which are deemed practically applicable under standard conditions.\nTo accurately generate experts that reflect the concepts included in a list, descriptive texts were prepared for each concept. For IPC, descriptions were generated based on the subclass symbols, including the subclass titles and references, as well as the symbols and titles of the main groups and subgroups to which each subclass belongs, thereby explaining the technologies associated with each subclass. For the elements, descriptive texts were generated for each individual element. The generation of these descriptive texts was performed using GPT-40. The prompts used for creating these descriptions are presented in Table S3.\nFrom the comprehensive list prepared, domain-specific expert LLMs were systematically created for each technological field. Specifically, expert LLMs were generated by instructing the solution-generating LLM to adopt expert roles through role-play prompting, as outlined in Table S4. Each expert LLM was tasked with generating 10 solutions. To ensure stable evaluation, the creation of experts and the generation of solutions were repeated five times.\nDue to the large number of experts required for solution generation, the process incurred significant computational cost and time. To address this, in the cases of light extraction challenges and IGZO-TFT issues, the relatively cost-efficient and faster GPT-40 model was used for both expert creation and solution generation. GPT-40 was accessed via its API with default parameters, including a temperature setting of 0.7."}, {"title": "4.3 Evaluations for Generated Solutions", "content": "The generated solutions were evaluated using three metrics: SBE, KBE, and HBE.

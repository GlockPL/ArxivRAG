{"title": "Recommending Actionable Strategies: A Semantic Approach to Integrating Analytical Frameworks with Decision Heuristics", "authors": ["Renato Ghisellini", "Remo Pareschi", "Marco Pedroni", "Giovanni Battista Raggi"], "abstract": "We present a novel approach for recommending actionable strategies by integrating strategic frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. While strategy frameworks provide systematic models for assessment and planning, and decision heuristics encode experiential knowledge, these traditions have historically remained separate. Our methodology bridges this gap using advanced natural language processing (NLP), demonstrated through integrating frameworks like the 6C model with the Thirty-Six Stratagems. The approach employs vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to map framework parameters to heuristic patterns, supported by a computational architecture that combines deep semantic processing with constrained use of Large Language Models. By processing both primary content and secondary elements (diagrams, matrices) as complementary linguistic representations, we demonstrate effectiveness through corporate strategy case studies. The methodology generalizes to various analytical frameworks and heuristic sets, culminating in a plug-and-play architecture for generating recommender systems that enable cohesive integration of strategic frameworks and decision heuristics into actionable guidance.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Organizations today rely on two primary but historically separate textual traditions for strategic management and decision-making: analytical frameworks and decision"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Integrating analytical frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis represents a highly interdisciplinary endeavor, drawing from multiple domains, including strategic management, heuristics, computer science, and linguistics. This confluence of fields necessitates thoroughly examining key concepts and prior work across several dimensions. Specifically, we must understand (1) how strategic frameworks systematize decision parameters, as exemplified by the 6C model; (2) how decision heuristics encapsulate experiential knowledge, illustrated through the Thirty-Six Stratagems; (3) how semantic analysis enables framework-heuristic integration; (4) how mathematical formulations like Kullback-Leibler divergence support validation; and (5) how gamification principles and Large Language Models facilitate practical implementation. The following subsections provide this essential foundation, which underlies our novel recommender-system architecture for strategic decision support."}, {"title": "2.1 The 6C Framework as an Analytical Classification Tool", "content": "The 6C framework was conceived to provide a set of clear, well-defined parameters that would enable straightforward experimentation with our semantic integration approach. While established frameworks like SWOT Analysis and Porter's Five Forces offer comprehensive analytical tools, the 6C parameters were specifically designed to facilitate initial testing and validation of our methodology, with the understanding that the same principles could then be transferred to these well-known and widely adopted frameworks. The parameters were distilled from an extensive study of strategic literature, offering a simplified yet robust foundation for our initial framework-heuristic integration experiments.\nThe key parameters of the 6C model are as follows:\n1. p\u2081 = Offensive Strength: The ability to proactively shape and influence the strategic landscape."}, {"title": "3.1 Vector Space Representation", "content": "The first step involves creating vector representations of both framework parameters and heuristic descriptions:\nv(t) = \u2211aw (w) \nw\u2208t\nwhere v(t) is the vector representation of text t, w represents individual words or phrases, e(w) is the embedding vector for word w, and aw is the weight assigned to word w. For framework parameters (in our case, the 6Cs), we create vectors from their definitions and associated descriptive text:\nPi = v(di) + \u03bb\u2211(Cij)\nj\nwhere pi is the vector for parameter i, d\u2081 is the base definition of parameter i, cij are associated contextual descriptions, and A is a weighting factor for contextual information. Detailed calculations and examples of this vector space representation are provided in Appendix A.1.1."}, {"title": "3.2 Semantic Similarity Computation", "content": "We compute semantic similarity between framework parameters and heuristics using the cosine similarity measure. Specifically, for a given parameter vector pi and heuristic vector hj, the similarity is:\nsim(pi, hj) = Pihj / ||Pi|| ||hj||\nwhere pihj denotes the dot (scalar) product of the two vectors,\nPihj = \u2211(Pi)k(hj)k\nk\nand ||pi|| (likewise ||hj||) is the Euclidean norm,\n||Pi|| =  \u221a(\u03a3((Pi)k) 2).\nk\nA higher cosine similarity value sim(pi, hj) indicates a closer semantic relationship between parameter p\u2081 and heuristic hj.\nComputing sim(pi, hj) for all parameters i \u2208 {1, ..., m} and all heuristics j \u2208 {1, ..., n} produces a similarity matrix S, in which each element sij is defined by:\nS = [[S11 S12 ... Sin], [S21 S22 ... S2n], [... ... ... ...], [Sm1 Sm2 ... Smn]] with Sij = sim(pi, hj)."}, {"title": "3.3 Distribution Discovery", "content": "For each heuristic hj, our system generates a discovered distribution across the framework parameters (e.g., the 6C parameters). Concretely, we first compute similarity scores sij between parameter pi and heuristic h\u2081 (Section 3.2). We then normalize these scores to form a probability-like distribution:\ndij = Sij / \u03a3k Skj,\nwhere dij represents the weight (or relative importance) of parameter p\u2081 in heuristic hj. This summation-based (L1) normalization treats each heuristic's parameter weights as if they were probabilities that sum to 1. It thus naturally encodes the idea that a given heuristic distributes its \u201cattention\u201d across the available parameters.\nNote on Alternative Normalization. An alternative would be to use the Euclidean (L2) norm, where\ndij = Sij / \u221a(\u03a3k(Skj)2),\nthereby turning each heuristic's parameter vector into a unit vector in 12 space. In our approach, we opt for L1 normalization to mirror a \"probability-like\u201d interpretation-each heuristic can be seen as distributing its \"weight\" over parameters in a manner analogous to probabilities. L2 normalization could be equally valid in other contexts, especially if one prefers strictly geometric interpretations of distance in the parameter space.\nTo validate these distributions, we compare them against expert-annotated distributions using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure. For Stratagem 24, this comparison yielded a KL divergence of 0.0273, indicating strong alignment between system-discovered and expert-provided distributions. Detailed calculations and additional examples of this validation process are provided in Appendix A.2.2.\nBy comparing discovered distributions against expert-annotated ones for each heuristic, we obtain a numerical sense of alignment or mismatch. This process can be iterated: a large KL divergence flags a heuristic whose vector representation needs either textual refinements (e.g., additional synonyms or clarifications) or updates to the weighting scheme. Over time, machine-based distribution discovery converges with expert insights, yielding robust mappings that faithfully reflect how these strategic heuristics fit into analytical parameters.\nAs we already pointed out, the experts in this step are specialists in the methodologies (e.g., the 6C model, the Thirty-Six Stratagems) rather than sector-specific domain experts. This distinction ensures that the high-level semantic structure of each stratagem is validated by those who understand it conceptually, independent of particular industries or case studies."}, {"title": "3.4 Stratagem Selection Algorithm", "content": "After the distribution discovery phase (Section 3.3), we obtain an invariant distribution of analytical properties for each heuristic. This invariant distribution reflects how strongly each heuristic (e.g., a particular stratagem) aligns with each framework parameter (e.g., the 6C model) based on the text analysis and expert validation.\nSituation-Specific Parameter Vector. In contrast, a variable (or current) situation vector, denoted by x, describes how the analytical parameters apply to the present scenario. For instance, if a certain strategic context demands high Offensive Strength (p1) and moderate Relational Capacity (p3), x will capture these intensities accordingly.\nMatching Heuristics to the Situation. By comparing x with each heuristic's invariant distribution, we produce a recommendation score that indicates how well that heuristic fits the present conditions. This process is summarized in Algorithm 1."}, {"title": "3.5 Semantic Validation", "content": "To ensure robustness and credibility in the discovered semantic mappings, we conduct a three-pronged validation:\n1.

More recently, there has been a surge of interest in context-aware recommender systems, which factor in dynamic variables such as user context, time, and location to enhance relevance. Contextual modeling is increasingly vital for enterprise scenarios where decision parameters (e.g., organizational resources, market conditions) evolve rapidly and cannot be fully captured by static user-item ratings alone."}, {"title": "7.2 Strategy Tools and Decision-Support Platforms", "content": "The formalization and systematization of organizational decision-making has evolved along several parallel paths. The Business Rules approach, pioneered by Ross [18], established foundational principles for encoding operational decision logic into explicit, executable statements. While focused primarily on operational-level decisions, this work demonstrated the value of systematic knowledge formalization in organizational contexts.\nAt the strategic level, the literature has long recognized the value of scenario planning for coping with uncertain futures [19]. Scenario planning enables decision-makers to systematically explore multiple plausible environments an organization might face [20]. Complementary to both business rules and scenario planning, more recent works have begun to incorporate gamification principles for interactive learning and engagement in strategic contexts. For instance, [21] propose Gamiflow, a flow-theory-based gamification framework that illustrates the potential of user-centric interfaces and simulations in educational or organizational settings.\nDespite these advances in rule-based systems and scenario-based platforms, many existing approaches remain limited in integrating different forms of strategic knowledge. Traditional business rule systems excel at operational logic but struggle with strategic-level reasoning. Similarly, scenario planning tools, while valuable for strategic exploration, often rely on predefined logic instead of natural language processing. They typically emphasize interface design, user motivation, or scenario exploration without deeply integrating semantic analysis to link strategic frameworks (e.g., Porter's Five Forces, the 6C framework) with heuristic"}, {"title": "7.3 AI-Assisted Decision Making and Centaurian Systems", "content": "Our recommender-system architecture for actionable strategies in the corporate world also aligns with the notion of centaurian design [22], where human experts work in concert with AI components to achieve superior outcomes. This paradigm, sometimes called \u201chuman-in-the-loop\u201d or \u201ccentaur systems,\u201d underscores the synergy between natural and artificial intelligence [24]. In particular, our approach can be viewed as a monotonic centaur system [22], because it augments existing human decision-making processes\u2014enhancing analytical scope and consistency\u2014without fundamentally altering the semantics of the previously manual workflow.\nBy contrast, certain creative or open-ended domains (e.g., art and design) may experience more \u201cdisruptive\u201d centaurian processes, in which AI-driven innovation generates outcomes far removed from traditional human routines [23]. In our corporate-strategy setting, the goal is to reinforce and systematize established decision mechanisms, using NLP to automate tasks like semantic similarity scoring, heuristic matching, and natural language reporting. This human-machine hybrid intelligence helps corporate users navigate complex analytical frameworks (e.g., 6C, Porter's Five Forces) alongside heuristic sets (e.g., Thirty-Six Stratagems) without displacing human strategists. Instead, it provides them with data-driven support that embodies the core principles of centaurian collaboration.\nLLMs for Explanation and Hypothesis Generation. Recent studies of GPT-4 and related models [25] further highlight how large language models can facilitate abductive reasoning i.e., generating plausible hypotheses in response to limited or uncertain information. Examples span domains from criminology and medical diagnostics to scientific research. These findings resonate with our system's approach: LLMs are integrated not as autonomous decision-makers but as collaborative components that offer explanatory narratives, surface novel insights, and support humans in exploring strategic possibilities. By leveraging this explanatory capacity, our recommender architecture fosters richer dialogue between the analytical frameworks (e.g., 6C) and heuristic libraries (e.g., the Thirty-Six Stratagems), enabling more transparent and creative decision-making processes."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "This paper has presented a context-aware, content-based recommender system designed to bridge the gap between analytical frameworks and decision heuristics through semantic analysis.

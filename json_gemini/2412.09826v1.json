Accurate\nmodeling of these structures underpins understanding of molecular interactions that drive immune recognition and\nresponse and is vital for the development, optimization, and design of antibodies for effective antibody-based vaccines\nand therapies.\nRecent advancements in computational biology have introduced groundbreaking methods that markedly enhance the\naccuracy of protein structure prediction. State-of-the-art deep learning-based models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], represented by\nthe AlphaFold [1, 2, 3] and RoseTTAFold [4, 5] series, have made substantial progress in the end-to-end prediction of\nsingle protein chains, protein complexes, and biomolecular interactions. These models utilize evolutionary information\nderived from multiple sequence alignments (MSA) to predict pairwise residue-residue evolutionary and spatial relation-\nships, which are crucial for accurate structural modeling. Despite these advances, the precision of antigen-antibody\nstructure prediction remains suboptimal [8, 9]. This is likely due to the distinct evolutionary patterns of antigens and\nantibodies compared to conventional protein complexes. Methods like AFSample [10] and AlphaFold3 [3]) attempt to\nemploy extensive structure sampling to improve prediction accuracy, but the computational demands of conducting\nhundreds or thousands of sampling times are often prohibitive, especially for high-throughput applications.\nSpecialized methods [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], such as IgFold [11], DeepAb [12], and AbodyBuilder [13], have been\ndeveloped to improve antibody structure prediction. These methods have demonstrated improved accuracy, especially\nin the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are crucial for antibody function. These advances hold\nsignificant promise for applications in antibody development and therapeutic development, particularly in predicting the\nproperties and functions of mutated antibodies. Nevertheless, these approaches primarily focus on predicting antibody\nstructures alone and do not extend to accurately predicting complex interactions between antigens and antibodies.\nConsequently, the accurate prediction of antigen-antibody structures remains an ongoing challenge."}, {"title": "2 Antigen-Antibody Structure Prediction", "content": "HelixFold-Multimer builds upon the AlphaFold-Multimer [2] architecture with small adjustments in the structure\nmodule.

Epitopes were defined\nas a subset of antigen residues in closest proximity to the antibody, identified based on spatial distance, under the\nassumption that these residues are most likely to participate in antigen-antibody interactions. The analysis (Figure 2(c))\nreveals that as the number of selected residues increases, the model's DockQ score consistently improves. This trend\nsuggests that providing a more complete set of epitope residues enhances the model's ability to accurately predict the\nantigen-antibody complex structure. However, when the number of epitope residues is very small (e.g., 5 or 10), there\nis a notable decrease in the DockQ score, sometimes even falling below the accuracy achieved without any specified\nepitope information. This decrease is likely due to the model's tendency to overly focus on a limited set of residues,\nwhich restricts its ability to learn from the broader structural context of the antigen-antibody interaction. Therefore,\nselecting an optimal number of epitope residues is crucial.

However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can also be used to estimate protein-protein\ninteractions. Building on this idea, we explore whether the confidence metric, ipTM, generated by HelixFold-Multimer,\ncan effectively estimate antigen-antibody interactions.\nThe confidence metric of HelixFold-Multimer is first evaluated for binder recognition. Binders for SARS-CoV-2 (RBD\ndomain), lysozyme, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) were\nobtained from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) for SARS-CoV-2 [[37]], the anti-Lysozyme dataset for lysozyme\n[[38]], the VEGF dataset for VEGF [[38]], and Thera-SAbDab for PD-1 [[39]], respectively. In addition, 1000 samples\nwere randomly selected from the B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing data of a healthy donor to serve as non-binders.\nFigure 3(a) presents a comparison of the area under the curve (AUC) scores, which reflect the quality of ranking, for\nthe confidence metric of HelixFold-Multimer, the confidence metric of AlphaFold 2.3 [8], and the sampling score\ngenerated by ESM2 [6] across four antigen targets. HelixFold-Multimer achieves AUC scores greater than 0.8 for\nSARS, LYSO, and VEGF, significantly outperforming the baseline methods, while its AUC for PD-1 is on par with the\nbaseline methods. These results demonstrate that the confidence metric of HelixFold-Multimer exhibits strong ranking\nperformance in the binder recognition task.

However, the significant\ncost and technical challenges associated with obtaining these structures limit the scalability and applicability of such\napproaches. Using predicted antigen-antibody structures as alternative inputs provides a practical and cost-effective\nsolution to address these limitations.\nEnergy-based methods, e.g., FoldX [43], Rosetta [44], MMGBSA, and MMPBSA[45] calculate the energy of the\ninteraction between protein pairs by evaluating various energy terms, such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic\ninteractions, and solvation effects to estimate the likelihood of binding. To assess the relationship between energy-based\nmethods and conformation quality, we analyzed the correlation between experimentally measured binding affinities\nand interaction energies calculated by FoldX, using conformations predicted by different structure prediction methods\n(Figure 3(c)). When using conformations predicted by AlphaFold-Multimer as inputs for FoldX, the correlation\nwith affinity data was minimal. However, significant correlations were observed when HelixFold-Multimer-predicted\nconformations were used, underscoring the critical role of accurate conformational predictions in enhancing the\nreliability of energy-based binding affinity evaluations.\nStructure-informed models, such as ESM-IF [32] and ProteinMPNN [33], have been shown in previous studies\n[34][36][46] to effectively predict protein-protein interactions. These models use the structures of the antigen and\nreference antibodies to estimate the binding affinities of mutated antibodies. We assess the influence of the structural\naccuracy of the antigen-(reference) antibody complex on the performance of these models. Specifically, we examine\nthe correlation between experimentally measured affinities and the affinity scores predicted by ESM-IF, using input\nstructures generated by different protein folding methods, as shown in Figure 3(d). The DockQ scores of the predicted\nstructures from these methods are provided in Supp. Table 5. We followed the approach outlined in [34], where\nevaluation was performed by providing the entire antibody variable region and antigen complex (Ab-Ag).

As expected, ESM-IF\nshows the best performance when crystallographic structures were provided as input. The model's performance is\nslightly lower when using high-precision structures predicted by AlphaFold3 and HelixFold-Multimer.

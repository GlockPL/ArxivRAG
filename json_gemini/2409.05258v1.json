In many scientific fields, these processes require substantial manual effort, as they often involve intricate experiments and extensive data collection. The ability to streamline these tasks could significantly accelerate the pace of innovation.\nMachine learning offers a unique opportunity in this regard. Unlike other scientific domains, hypothesis validation in machine learning can be automated through code, with effectiveness measured numerically using objective criteria such as loss or accuracy. This capability makes machine learning an ideal field for exploring automation in research.\nBuilding on this potential, we propose a framework that leverages a top-down methodology using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-level hypotheses. Although our approach is not intended to replace bottom-up methods such as AutoML-Zero(Real et al. 2020) or MetaQNN(Santoro et al. 2016), it offers a complementary path by introducing cross-domain innovation and a broader exploration of potential solutions. By formulating and testing hypotheses in natural language, our method lowers the barrier to entry for a wider range of researchers, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and the integration of diverse knowledge from various fields. This combination of top-down and bottom-up strategies improves the research pipeline, providing a more comprehensive and innovative approach to automated machine learning research.\nIn this paper, we contribute by:\n\u2022 Proposing and evaluating viable components: Generating viable hypotheses to replace neural network components and achieve competitive performance with known alternatives.\n\u2022 Training a reward model: Learning patterns between the content of a hypothesis and its downstream performance.\n\u2022 Efficient Hypothesis Generation: Using the reward model to prune and prioritize hypotheses, improving the efficiency of generation, validation, and evaluation."}, {"title": "Caveats", "content": "1. This work does not make any assumptions about the inherent capabilities of LLMs to reason or have a deep understanding of ML topics. Even a random string generator can yield a meaningful hypothesis given unlimited attempts, akin to the infinite monkey theorem, which suggests that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of Shakespeare. Our assumptions on the state of LLMs and ML are as follows.\n(a) LLMs are good enough at generating feasible outputs, thus narrowing down our search space meaningfully from a set of random outputs.\n(b) LLMs (and ML models in general) are good enough in pattern recognition. Therefore, training a reward model on performance would allow the model to identify common patterns among successful hypotheses.\nIn short, we solely explore if LLMs can identify what would \"look like\" a good hypothesis based on the patterns that it has seen in previous examples.\n2. In this work, we solely lay the foundation and do not claim that our automated research necessarily would yield state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in machine learning research. We explore the feasibility of operationalizing steps involved in ML research to a level where the current state of LLMs can generate feasible hypotheses efficiently.\n3. This work was conducted using the authors' personal time and resources, limiting the scope to a small set of datasets and experiments. We hope that larger-scale experiments conducted at research labs interested in exploring this topic could further solidify this framework.\nThis work assumes an existing baseline solution and explores incremental innovations in its components, focusing on one component at a time. For example, in a neural network, the component of interest might be an activation function. We generate a set of viable alternatives (hypotheses) and evaluate their performance against baseline components.\nThe framework includes a generator for hypothesis creation, a validator to ensure basic validity, and an evaluator to measure success metrics such as validation loss. A reward model is trained to prioritize hypotheses that perform well compared to baselines, reducing computational burden while maintaining a high probability of discovering valuable new hypotheses.\nWhile we manually verified and adjusted the validator and evaluator functions, the generation of hypotheses was not manually reviewed, highlighting the potential for fully automated research.

Google's AutoML and Auto-Keras (Jin, Song, and Hu 2019) have made machine learning more accessible. AutoML-Zero (Real et al. 2020) and MetaQNN (Baker et al. 2016) take a bottom-up combinatorial approach to model construction, evolving algorithms, and network architectures from basic operations. In contrast, our work uses a top-down method, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to start with high-level concepts, allowing for broader exploration and the potential for cross-domain innovation.\nMeta-Learning has also made significant strides, with foundational methods like MAML enabling fast task adaptation (Finn, Abbeel, and Levine 2017). Matching Networks (Vinyals et al. 2016) and Prototypical Networks (Snell, Swersky, and Zemel 2017) advanced few-shot learning, while optimization-based methods (Ravi and Larochelle 2016) and Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (Santoro et al. 2016) enhanced meta-learning capabilities. Simplified approaches like first-order meta-learning (Nichol, Achiam, and Schulman 2018) and Probabilistic MAML (Finn, Xu, and Levine 2018) further refined the field.\nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) has progressed with approaches like NASNet (Zoph et al. 2018), ENAS (Pham et al. 2018), and DARTS (Liu, Simonyan, and Yang 2019), which introduced scalable and efficient architecture search methods. Auto-Keras (Jin, Song, and Hu 2019) and ProxylessNAS (Cai, Zhu, and Han 2019) made NAS more accessible and practical, while AmoebaNet (Real et al. 2019), MnasNet (Tan et al. 2019), and FBNet (Wu et al. 2019) pushed the boundaries of mobile and hardware-aware optimization.\nHyperparameter Optimization has evolved with Bayesian optimization (Bergstra et al. 2011), later improved by Snoek et al. (Snoek, Larochelle, and Adams 2012). Random search (Bergstra and Bengio 2012) provided a simpler alternative, while Hyperband (Li et al. 2018) and BOHB (Falkner, Klein, and Hutter 2018) optimized resource allocation. Gradient-based methods (Maclaurin, Duvenaud, and Adams 2015) and automated tuning for neural networks (Mendoza et al. 2016) further advanced the field.\nThe objective of our work aligns with ongoing efforts in AutoML, meta-learning, NAS, and hyperparameter optimization, however, it goes beyond those capabilities as our framework proposes and evaluates new components in a top-down approach and builds on the baseline state of the art."}, {"title": "Framework", "content": "The scope of this work begins when a specific area of machine learning research is selected, such as the development of a new activation function. The researcher selects this area and constructs a baseline set of solutions $B = \\{b_1, b_2,...\\}$ that represent the current state-of-the-art or commonly used approaches. The goal is to generate a set of viable alternatives $H = \\{h_1, h_2, ...\\}$ to these baselines. Each proposed hypothesis $h_i$ is generated such that it can replace a component $b_i$ in the baseline solutions, such as substituting a new activation function in place of the standard ReLU in a neural network. This structured approach ensures that the generated hypotheses are directly relevant and potentially beneficial to the chosen area of research.\nOur approach for generating and measuring the performance of each of the proposed hypotheses involves a generator, a validator, and an evaluator. A reward model is then trained to map the hypotheses to their success metrics measured by the evaluator. This reward is then used to improve the efficiency of the system by prioritizing more promising hypotheses solely by their content. In what follows we provide more details on each of these components."}, {"title": "The Generator", "content": "The generator is the mechanism through which a feasible hypothesis $h_i$ is reached and sent for validation and evaluation. Here, it is a language model prompted by natural language, optionally followed by a reward model. In the activation function case study, these hypotheses take the form of novel activation functions. LLMs are trained on a comprehensive corpus of existing activation functions and related mathematical formulations, enabling them to propose viable functions.\nWe experiment with two types of base prompts. The first type encourages the model to discover incremental proposed blocks, to which we refer to as Incrementality Encouraging Prompting (IEP for short). The following is an example of such a prompt, used for generating activation function blocks.\n\"define a python class that inherits from pytorch nn.Module. I should be able to use it as an activation function. Make sure if it has any parameters, all of them are set to default values so I can initialize without specifying any parameters. Try to come up with something that combines characteristics of Sigmoid/Tanh, ReLU, and ELU.\u201d\nThe second type of base prompt aims to reduce the likelihood of trivial incrementality. We refer to this as Novelty Encouraged Prompting (NEP) prompting. An example of such a prompt for activation function is as follows.\n\"define a python class that inherits from pytorch nn.Module. I should be able to use it as an activation function. Make sure if it has any params, all of them are set to default values so I can initialize without specifying any params. This function should not resemble common activation functions like ReLU, ELU, Sigmoid, or Tanh, and should explore unusual mathematical operations, combinations, or transformations. The expression can involve basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, exponentials, or other non-linear operations, but avoid straightforward or commonly used forms in neural networks.\"\nThe generator then involves a few wrappers around this base prompt, to request the implementation code for the proposed hypothesis in a parsable way.\nCode 1 is an example of an activate function generated using the incrementality-encouraging base prompt. As prompted, the model clearly borrows characteristics from two commonly used activation functions of ReLU and Sigmoid."}, {"title": "The Validator", "content": "Each proposed hypothesis is first passed through a validator function, denoted $v$. This function checks the validity of the hypothesis, ensuring it meets necessary criteria before further evaluation. For a proposed activation function $h_i$, the validator function $v(h_i)$ returns a binary value indicating whether $h_i$ is a valid activation function (that is, $v(h_i) \\in \\{0,1\\}$).\nFor our case study on activation functions, we implement the validator manually and as a unittest\u00b9. The validator checks if $h_i$ inherits from nn.Module, has the required initialization and forward functions, all its parameters have default values, and can pass a few basic test cases. We provide code snippets of this validator in the Appendix section Code 9.\nFully automating this function is very feasible, but out of the scope of this effort."}, {"title": "The Evaluator", "content": "Valid hypotheses are fully evaluated using an evaluation function, denoted $e$. The goal of this function is to replace a baseline component $b_i$ with an alternative hypothesis $h_i$ and measure the performance of the model in the task(s) of interest. For our case, this translates to integrating the hypothesis into a machine learning model and measuring its performance, specifically its loss on the validation split of the dataset (val-loss). To streamline the process, we perform a single iteration of forward and backward passes to obtain a preliminary loss value, rather than conducting a full training and evaluation cycle. Formally, for a model $m$ and an activation function $h_i$, the val loss is calculated as $e(m(h_i))$.\nIn our experiments, we hard-coded the architecture to a 2-layer MLP, and used cross-entropy and MSE loss for a set of classification and regression tasks. We also define the problem as solving the classification and regression instances in a one-pass learning setup (only one epoch) to reduce the computation required for each $h_i$ and enable more extensive exploration across a larger set of hypotheses."}, {"title": "The Reward", "content": "Passing the set of hypotheses H to the evaluator function results in the collection of pairs of generated hypotheses (activation functions) and their corresponding validation losses, in the form of $(h_i, l(h_i))$. We define the reward as the win rate of the proposed hypothesis $h_i$ over the baselines. Specifically, we measure two metrics:\nBaseline Win Rate (B-WR): This metric measures the percentage of times $h_i$ outperforms any given baseline $b_j$ across different tasks and over different runs. Formally, it measures $P(l(h_i) < l(b_j))$.\nBaseline State-of-the-Art Win Rate (BSOTA-WR): This metric measures the win rate of the proposed hypothesis over the best runs of the entire baseline set B in each task / dataset. Formally, it is defined as $P(l(h_i) < min(l(b_j))|j=1,...,|B|)$. Please note that the minimum operation is done on the average loss of different runs for each baseline, thus the best baseline run still contains a distribution of losses (resulting from several runs / random initialization), allowing for calculating a probabilistic win rate.\nThe reward model is then trained as a ranking model mapping the content of the hypothesis $h_i$ to its downstream performance (i.e. loss). In other words, this model is aimed to looking at the content of a proposed component (i.e. code of an activation function), and be able to predict how well it is likely to perform in terms of winning over the baseline set. Intuitively, the reward model learns patterns in the content of the proposed activation functions, leading to better performance."}, {"title": "Closing the Loop", "content": "In the initial round of hypothesis generation, every hypothesis is evaluated using a brute-force approach, where each one is passed through the validator and evaluator in a fully exploratory iteration. This process allows for comprehensive data collection, yielding the success metrics B-WR and BSOTA-WR for each validated and evaluated hypothesis.\nWe employ three LLMs to generate a dataset of 2000 validated and evaluated hypotheses for each component type. Once this initial data is collected, the second iteration leverages a trained reward model to streamline the process. The reward model is used to prune the newly generated hypotheses, filtering them to select the top-k candidates based on their predicted performance. These top-k hypotheses, expected to be the most promising, are the only ones that proceed to the full evaluation phase, which involves more intensive computational resources."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "We aim to identify novel components that improve a simple neural network's performance across various tasks using a one-pass learning setup, where the model is trained for a single epoch.

We also report the success rate of the Validator, indicating the fraction of generated hypotheses that had the valid format. Please note that all of these metrics are averaged over the whole dataset of hypotheses generated in the first iteration (2000 samples generated for each component type). The performance of the individual components can be seen in the scatter plots provided in Figure. 8. As can be observed, in the majority of cases the generated hypotheses have a low win rate compared to the baseline set, however, there are components with win rates very close to 1, indicating that they always outperform every single baseline individually and also the baseline state of the art."}, {"title": "Reward model Evaluation", "content": "As mentioned earlier, the goal of the reward model is to learn to predict the performance of a proposed hypothesis solely from its content (code). To train such a model, we extract three different code embedding features from the content of the implementation code generated, namely CodeBERT(Feng et al. 2020), Graph-CodeBert(Guo et al. 2020), and CodeGen(Nijkamp et al. 2022). We report the results on ranking models trained on the concatenation of all three features in table 2. In the Appendix, we also provide ablation on the same metrics for each feature type, and also for preprocessors and regularizers.\nWe use established ranking metrics, including Kendall's Tau (k - \u03c4), Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), as reported in Tables 2, 3, and 2 for activation functions, preprocessing functions, and regularization functions respectively. From table 2, for activation, preprocessing, and regularization functions, respectively. These metrics show successful generalization of the ranking models across components generated by different language models.

Even when correlation values are modest, they remain directionally positive, indicating meaningful ranking performance."}, {"title": "Efficienct Hypothesis Evaluation", "content": "We also evaluate the efficiency of the reward model in terms of prioritizing the candidates in the second iteration. That means that we measure the performance of the top 50 candidates at each step if we were to sort the candidates based on their predicted reward.

This could lead to overfitting to specific datasets or tasks without contributing to broader advancements.\nReward Collapse: During our experiments, we observed a significant issue with the generation of redundant and highly similar hypotheses, particularly when using GPT-3.5-turbo to generate activation functions. As illustrated in Figure 5, the top-12 activation functions often exhibit striking similarities, indicating a lack of diversity in the generated hypotheses. This phenomenon, known as reward collapse, occurs when the reward model becomes overly focused on specific patterns, leading to a narrow exploration of the hypothesis space. The right side of the figure, shows the pairwise similarity between the top-12 candidates, it can be observed that the one difference component (highlighted in red) completely stands out both in terms of the shape of its activation function, and also in terms of its similarity to others in the embeddings space. Given this phenomenon, we did a preliminery exploration on whether we can construct a set of diverse activation functions by constructing a set iteratively and greedily as a trade-off of win rate and diversity.\nThis greedy and iterative approach encourages the selection of hypotheses that are both high-performing and diverse, thereby promoting a broader and more thorough exploration of the hypothesis space. By balancing the exploitation of known successful solutions with the exploration of novel and potentially superior alternatives, this method helps mitigate the risk of reward collapse. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in Figure 6, where the top-12 activation functions constructed with this method exhibit a greater diversity compared to the initial set. This suggests the possibility of preventing collapse in case of finetuning the generator (future work).\nSOTA Inductive Bias and unintended plagiarism: LLMs, trained on vast datasets, risk generating outputs that closely resemble existing works, leading to unintended plagiarism and a bias toward state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. This limits innovation, as models may favor incremental changes over novel ideas. To address this, it's essential to build careful baseline sets and implement strong credit assignment. Prompt design also plays a key role; novelty-focused prompts yield more diverse outputs, while those targeting incremental improvements often mirror existing literature. Refining prompts to avoid reliance on known solutions and explore new areas can reduce plagiarism and SOTA bias, encouraging truly innovative contributions.\nOptimizing for incremental short term improvements:"}, {"title": "Future Work", "content": "Future research could focus on expanding the framework to other types of machine learning components beyond activation functions, preprocessors and regularizers, and including more complex architectures and diverse datasets. Additionally, refining the reward model to balance novelty and performance more effectively, and incorporating stronger theoretical constraints, could help mitigate risks like reward collapse and incremental bias. An intriguing direction for future work is fine-tuning the language model based on the reward signal, which could guide the model towards generating higher-quality and more innovative hypotheses. Moreover, ensuring that the embeddings extracted from the generated hypotheses are consistent with those of the backbone model could open the possibility for fully differentiable training, further enhancing the integration and efficiency of the framework. Further experiments could also explore constructing prompt engineering practices to reduce unintended plagiarism and inductive bias. And last but not least, a proper credit assignment framework would be a necessity for improving this line of research."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This work introduces a framework for automating machine learning research by leveraging large language models to generate, validate, and evaluate novel components.

This is achieved using the StandardScaler:\n$X_{ij} = \\frac{X_{ij} - \u03bc_j}{\u03c3_j}$\nwhere $X_{ij}$ is the normalized feature value, $X_{ij}$ is the original feature value, $\u03bc_j$ is the mean of the j-th feature, and $\u03c3_j$ is the standard deviation of the j-th feature.\n2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** After normalization, PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality while preserving the maximum variance. PCA transforms the data $X_{scaled}$ to a lower-dimensional space:\n$X_{pca} = X_{scaled} W_{pca}$\nwhere $W_{pca}$ contains the principal components (eigenvectors) corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of $X_{scaled}$."}, {"title": "Benefits of the 'NormalizedPCA' Function", "content": "1. **Effective Scaling:** Normalizing features ensures that all features contribute equally to the PCA", "Reduction": "By applying PCA after normalization", "Performance": "Proper normalization and dimensionality reduction improve the performance of machine learning models"}]}

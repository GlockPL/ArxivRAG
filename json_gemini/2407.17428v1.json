Remarkably, the AIGC model is computation-intensive, thus necessitating the allocation of AIGC tasks to edge servers with ample computational resources. Given the distinct cost of the AIGC model trained with varying-sized datasets and AIGC tasks possessing disparate demand, it is imperative to formulate a differential pricing strategy to optimize the utility of teleoperators and edge servers concurrently. Nonetheless, the pricing strategy formulation is under information asymmetry, i.e., the demand (e.g., the difficulty level of AIGC tasks and their distribution) of AIGC tasks is hidden information to edge servers.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Driven by the demands of increasing productivity, reducing operational risks, and saving overhead [1], teleoperation has gained significant traction in recent years. However, the practical application of teleoperation still faces certain challenges, particularly in low-light conditions like nighttime construction sites, tunnels, and sewers [2]. Concretely, teleoperation needs to accomplish real-time interaction between the video streams from the construction site and the operation commands issued by the teleoperator. At night, the images captured by the camera will suffer from uneven illumination, low contrast, and color distortion [3], rendering it challenging for the teleoperator to issue precise operation commands, thereby potentially leading to several serious consequences as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTo refine teleoperation, it is essential to integrate low-light image enhancement techniques. Mainstream low-light image enhancement techniques include supervised deep learning models and unsupervised deep learning models [4]. In which, unsupervised low-light image enhancement models can subtly tackle the issue of collecting paired datasets; however, certain semantic information will lost when performing image enhancement, thereby compromising the downstream visual task [5]. In contrast, benefiting from labeling information, supervised low-light image enhancement models can consistently maintain a more stable and excellent performance [6], such as the state-of-the-art diffusion model [7].\nNotably, the diffusion model is computationally intensive and the tele-robots are typically not equipped with ample computational resources, thus posing a challenge to accomplish the low light image enhancement task within the response time requirement. To this end, inspired by the AI-generated content (AIGC) edge architecture proposed by [8], we propose offloading the low-light image enhancement task (AIGC task) to edge servers equipped with the diffusion-based AIGC model, so as to ensure real-time and high-quality interactive teleoperation.\nRegarding AIGC task offloading, teleoperators should charge for the AIGC service to incentivize the edge server to perform the AIGC task [9]. Remarkably, to guarantee the efficient offloading of AIGC tasks, varying difficulty of AIGC tasks should be handled by different types of AIGC models. As depicted in Fig. 2, in terms of visual perception, the first and second AIGC tasks can be processed effectively via an AIGC model trained on a small dataset, while the third one requires an AIGC model trained on a large dataset. Accordingly, given paired training data collection and model training, the cost of the AIGC model trained with varying-sized datasets is distinct. Therefore, it is crucial for edge servers to formulate differentiated pricing strategies to safeguard the utility of both edge servers and teleoperators. However, edge servers will confront information asymmetry in formulating pricing strategies, i.e., the difficulty level of AIGC tasks and their distribution are hidden information to edge servers before receiving offloaded AIGC tasks, thereby posing a challenge to identifying the optimal pricing strategy. For this reason, the first research question of this paper is\nQ1: Regarding edge servers, how can a differential pricing strategy for AIGC models be formulated under information asymmetry, so as to optimize the utility of both edge servers and teleoperators?\nFor Q1, certain solutions exist that utilize contract theory to solve similar problems [10][11]. For instance, since the offloading service providers do not know the actual computing resources of the parked vehicles, i.e., information asymmetry, the authors in [10] utilized contract theory to formulate differential pricing strategies to optimize the utility of the offloading system. In addition, the authors in [11] proposed a contract theory-empowered resource pricing scheme in the context of information asymmetry where the offloading service requesting vehicle is not aware of the free resources and dwell time of the offloading service providing vehicles. The contract bundles of previously mentioned contract theory-empowered pricing schemes are generally in the form of {computational resources, pricing}, all of which are quantifiable metrics. However, when using contract theory to solve Q1 results in a contract bundle of {AIGC model type, pricing}, in which, different from the computational resources, the AIGC model in the contract bundle is challenging to quantify. Therefore, we modify the contract bundle associated with Q1 to {required performance of the AIGC model, pricing}. Here, the contract bundle is mapped with the AIGC task difficulty level, thus guaranteeing the utility of both edge servers and teleoperators.\nUpon pricing strategy formulated by edge servers, the teleoperator should opt for AIGC models according to the difficulty level of AIGC tasks. As shown in Fig. 3, considering the performance scores of different AIGC tasks processed by models trained on various-sized datasets, not all AIGC tasks should leverage the AIGC model trained on large datasets. The optimal strategy is for the teleoperator to determine the AIGC service based on the difficulty of the AIGC task. Nonetheless, manually identifying the difficulty level of AIGC tasks might be tedious and unnecessary for workers, as the envision of the teleoperation system is to enable workers to operate with a daytime-like experience even at night, without additional effort. In other words, the vision information received by workers at night should closely resemble that obtained under normal lighting conditions, thus leading to the second research question\nQ2: Regarding teleoperators, how can the difficulty level of AIGC tasks be assessed automatically and accurately to ensure teleoperator efficiency?\nInspired by the use of LLaVA, a trained Visual Large Language Model based on LLaMA, to simulate five categories of realistic personalities for subjectively rating different AI-generated images [14], we intend to utilize the Vision Language Model (VLM) to aid teleoperators in automatically assessing the difficulty level of AIGC tasks, thereby addressing Q2. The VLM-aided difficulty evaluation consists of three processes: evaluation metrics determination, initialization guidance, and prompt determination. First, the prompt engineer will interact with the VLM agents to identify difficulty evaluation metrics and conduct statistics on the accuracy of the difficulty evaluation of AIGC tasks under different metrics, thereby determining the optimal evaluation metrics. Next, upon the determined evaluation metrics, the VLM agents will be initialized and instructed. Finally, the prompt engineer will determine the final prompt based on the evaluation metrics and"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "In this Section, we review several related works, which are AIGC service in networks and contract theory for task allocation, respectively.\nA. AIGC Service in Networks\nWith the proliferation of Large Language Models, numerous studies have explored the integration of AIGC services with edge networks. The authors in [15] introduced a framework that integrates wireless perception with AIGC, enhancing the quality of generated digital content and better aligning it with user preferences. In [14], the authors proposed an LLM-empowered reinforcement learning method aimed at maximizing the subjective Quality of Experience and energy efficiency for users adopting Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based AIGC services for image generation. In [16], AIGC services are considered computation-intensive, and the authors devised a decentralized incentive mechanism for AIGC service allocation. Specifically, they utilized a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning method to balance the supply and demand between AIGC services and vehicles, optimizing user experience and reducing transmission latency. Given the stochastic nature of AIGC services, the authors in [8] formulated an AIGC service provider (ASP) selection problem to enhance user satisfaction and employed deep reinforcement learning to match users with the optimal ASP. Analogously, in [17], the authors presented an AI-generated optimal decision algorithm for ASP selection. To facilitate the operation of AIGC services on resource-constrained mobile devices, the authors in [18] proposed a collaborative distributed diffusion-based AIGC framework. This framework distributes the computational workload of the diffusion model's reverse process among multiple mobile devices, thereby effectively reducing the overhead of running the AIGC service.\nIn addition to the above works, several studies focus on the data generated via AIGC service in edge networks. For instance, the authors in [19] proposed a blockchain-empowered AIGC framework and a consensus protocol, named proof of AIGC, to protect the copyright and ownership of AIGC. The authors in [20] addressed the trust issues of AIGC in the metaverse by designing a smart contract-based verification mechanism to ensure the authenticity of AIGC. Similarly, the authors in [21] also focused on the trustworthiness of AIGC, presenting a series of countermeasures to enhance the security and privacy of AIGC-generated data.\nThese works, from various perspectives, investigate AIGC services in networks and pave the way for future research in this domain. Notably, distinct from existing studies, our work focuses on addressing AIGC service allocation from an information asymmetry perspective.\nB. Contract Theory for Task Allocation\nContract theory excels in tackling the information asymmetry problem by aligning the incentive of agents with the utility of principals, which has been extensively investigated in the wireless communication sector for task allocation [22]. For example, in the context of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) having limited knowledge of how much effort the unmanned area vehicles (UAVs) will exert for resource sharing, the authors in [23] proposed a contract theory-based mechanism to spur the UAVs. The authors in [24] leveraged contract theory to resolve the information asymmetry encountered during resource allocation between the source transmitter and relay nodes. In which, the information asymmetry indicates the source transmitter is unknown the computation time and relay power of relay nodes. In the context of task offloading, the delay tolerance and sensitivity of users are unknown for edge servers, thus, the authors in [25] utilized contract theory to augment the resource utilization efficiency.\nIn addition to the aforementioned wireless scenarios, the application of contract theory for task allocation in vehicular"}, {"title": "III. FRAMEWORK ILLUSTRATION", "content": "In this section, we introduce the framework of AIGC task allocation assisted by VLM-empowered contract theory.\nedge computing has also been extensively investigated. In distributed vehicular edge computing, where the computing capability and energy resources of surrounding vehicles (SuVs) are unknown to task vehicles (TaVs), the authors in [26] devised an exploration and exploitation-assisted contract theory method to motivate SuVs to perform offloaded tasks from TaVs. In the framework of Collaborative Vehicular Edge Computing, the authors in [10] used contract theory to encourage parked vehicles to share resources with other vehicles, despite the parking behaviors and computing overheads being unknown to other vehicles, causing information asymmetry. Furthermore, since the roadside unit (RSU) has limited knowledge of vehicle parking durations, the authors in [11], [27], [28], and [29] leveraged contract theory to incentivize vehicles to rent resources to the RSU, thereby optimizing various metrics during task allocation.\nInspired by these existing works, we leverage the contract theory to acquire the pricing strategy for edge servers, resolving the information asymmetry caused by edge servers unknown the difficulty level distribution of AIGC tasks. Notably, different from existing works, the contract bundle, i.e., the AIGC model, in our paper, is challenging to quantify. Furthermore, the contract theory utilized in this paper is aided by VLM, which is the first attempt as far as we know.\nA. Framework Overview\nThe AIGC task allocation framework proposed in this paper is depicted in Fig. 4, which contains four main components, namely, the contract theory in Part A, the VLM agents in Part B, the construction site in Part C, and the edge servers in Part D. Subsequently, we will elaborate the specific functions of each component.\nContract Theory: The contract bundles in the task allocation system will generated via the smart gateway by invoking the contract theory in real time. Concretely, the generation of the contract bundles relies collectively on the model information of all edge servers and the distribution of AIGC task difficulty level in the offloading system.\nVLM Agents: Upon generation of an AIGC task, similar to [14], the VLM agents will assess its difficulty based on the pre-defined prompt and select the corresponding contract bundle for it. Subsequently, the smart gateway will determine the optimal task allocation scheme based on the environmental information of the offloading system and the contract bundles selected by AIGC tasks.\nConstruction Site: Numerous AIGC tasks will generated at the construction site. Here, AIGC tasks are low-light images captured by cameras equipped with various types of machines on the construction site, such as excavators, cranes, and bulldozers. It is worth noting that, we assume that the difficulty level of all AIGC tasks is determined before offloading 1."}, {"title": "IV. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "As per the framework presented in Section III, we pinpoint the system model in three subsections, i.e., the model of AIGC service in Section IV-A, the model of contract theory in Section IV-B, and the model of task allocation in Section IV-C.\nA. Model of AIGC Service\nIn this paper, the AIGC service is provided by the diffusion-based AIGC model. The diffusion model includes two phases, i.e., forward process and reverse process [31] [32].\nThe forward process is a diffusion process, in which the noise will gradually added to the original data and eventually obtain the pure noise that abides by Gaussian distribution. Mathematically, the final obtained pure noise $x_T \\sim N(0,I)$ is progressively transformed from the original data $x_0$ via\n$q(x_T|x_0) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T}q(x_t|x_{t-1})$\n(1)\nand\n$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_tI)$\n(2)\nin T steps. Here, $\\beta_t$ is the schedule parameter of the diffusion model.\nThe reverse process, a.k.a. denoising process, is the key component of the diffusion model, also of the AIGC service, which aims to deduce the target $x_0$ from the noise sample $\\hat x_T \\sim N(0, I)$. i.e.,\n$P(x_0) = p(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_\\phi(x_{t-1}|x_t)$,\n(3)\nwhere $p(x_T) = N(0, I)$.\nNotably, since the AIGC service utilized in this paper is for low-light image enhancement, the reverse process will be a conditional denoising process [6]. Therefore, the Eq.(3) should be transformed into\n$P(x_0) = P(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^{T}P_\\phi(x_{t-1}|x_t, \\hat x)$,\n(4)\nwith a conditional input $\\hat x$, i.e., low lighting condition image in this paper. Here, $P_\\phi(x_{t-1}|x_t, \\hat x)$ is similar to (2),\n$P(x_{t-1}|x_t, \\hat x) = N(\\hat x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x), \\sigma I)$,\n(5)\nwhere $\\mu_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x)$ and $\\sigma_t^2$ are approximated value of the noise added in the t-th step of the forward process and variance parameter, respectively. Here, $\\mu_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x)$ is defined as\n$\\mu_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}\\left(x_t - \\frac{\\beta_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha_t}}}\\epsilon_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x)\\right)$,\n(6)\nwhere $\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t$, $\\bar \\alpha_t = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} \\alpha_\\tau$.\nIn summary, the kernel of the AIGC model is to train a network to achieve the function of $\\epsilon_\\phi(x_t, t, \\hat x)$. Therefore, the input and output of the AIGC service will be $\\hat x$ and $x_0$, representing the low light condition image (AIGC task) and enhanced image (processed result), respectively.\nB. Model of Contract Theory\nWhen adopting the contract theory to formulate the pricing strategy for AIGC tasks with varying difficulty levels, hidden information exists, i.e., the difficulty level and associated distribution of AIGC tasks are unknown for edge servers, before offloading. Therefore, we begin by classifying the AIGC tasks by their difficulty levels.\nFor clarity, we consider the scenario of AIGC tasks with two levels of difficulty only: low and high, represented by $\\theta_L$ and $\\theta_H$, respectively. The distribution of these difficulty levels is denoted by the probabilities of $\\theta_L$ and $\\theta_H$ tasks, represented as $\\beta_L$ and $\\beta_H$, where $\\beta_L + \\beta_H = 1$. During AIGC task allocation, edge servers will predict these two parameters to adjust the contract bundle in real time.\nFor each type of AIGC task, represented by $\\theta_i$, the pricing strategy is in the form of contract bundle $(p_i, I(\\phi_i))$. $p_i$ means the price of the AIGC model tailored for $\\theta_i$ AIGC tasks and $I(\\phi_i)$ is required performance of the AIGC model."}, {"title": "V. VLM-EMPOWERED CONTRACT THEORY FOR AIGC TASK ALLOCATION", "content": "We begin with the specific procedure of AIGC tasks assessment in Section V-A. Subsequently, we present the solutions for problems (9a) and (15a) in Section V-B.\nA. Difficulty Evaluation via VLM-Empowered Agent\nThe mechanism of our proposed VLM-empowered difficulty evaluation is analogous to the scheme mentioned in [14], which utilizes the capability of chain-of-thought [34] of VLM agents. The specific procedure of our proposed method is depicted in Fig. 6, including three parts, optimal evaluation metrics determination in Part A, initial guidance for VLM agents in Part B, and difficulty evaluation in Part C.\nAs for Part A, the prompt engineer will begin by interacting with the VLM agent in multiple rounds only with the AIGC tasks, which difficulty level needs to be assessed. After each round of interaction, the prompt engineer elicited the reasoning information of VLM agents in the form of the output of agents 1, 2, and 3 depicted in Part A of Fig. 6. Subsequently, the prompt engineer will perform statistical analysis on the accuracy of VLM agents in AIGC tasks difficulty evaluation with different reasoning information and identify the optimal evaluation metrics.\nWith the optimal evaluation metrics obtained from Part A, the prompt engineer will provide several metrics-related examples to guide VLM agents. The basic rationale behind this step is similar to the essence of [34], i.e., providing examples to refine the reasoning capability of VLM agents, so as to boost the performance of VLM agents.\nUpon completion of Parts A and B of Fig. 6, the prompt engineer will develop the prompt according to determined optimal metrics. The prepared prompt and the specific difficulty assessment of the VLM agent to two distinct AIGC tasks are depicted in Part C of Fig. 6. Notably, the VLM agent not only assesses the AIGC tasks but also provides detailed reasoning information, aligning with the chain of thought prompting mentioned in [34].\nB. Contract Theory-Assisted Task Allocation\nRegarding problem (9a), we can apply the optimization method mentioned in [35] to reduce the constraint and derive the optimal contract bundle.\nConcretely, after applying the optimization method, the four inequality constraints will be transformed into two equality constraints, which are written as\n$\\theta_L ln[\\eta_2(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r1})] + \\eta_3(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r2}) - p_L = 0$\n(16)\nand\n$\\theta_H ln[\\eta_2(I(\\phi_H) - I_{r1})] + \\eta_3(I(\\phi_H) - I_{r2}) - p_H = \\theta_H ln[\\eta_2(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r1})] + \\eta_3(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r2}) - p_L,$\n(17)\nrespectively.\nAfter refining (16) and (17), we can acquire the expression of pricing for low and high difficulty levels AIGC tasks, i.e., $p_L$ and $p_H$, as\n$p_L = \\theta_L ln[\\eta_2(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r1})] + \\eta_3(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r2})$\n(18)\nand\n$p_H = UW_{(\\theta_H)}(I(\\phi_H)) - UW_{(\\theta_H)}(I(\\phi_L)) + p_L$.\n(19)\nIn which, $UW_{(\\theta_H)}(I(\\phi_i))$ is defined as\n$UW_{(\\theta_H)}(I(\\phi_i)) = \\theta_H ln[\\eta_2(I(\\phi_i) - I_{r1})] + \\eta_3(I(\\phi_i) - I_{r2})$.\n(20)\nSubsequently, substituting (18) and 19 into problem (9a), the original constrained problem will be an unconstrained optimization problem, i.e.,\n$\\beta_L(p_L - \\eta_1I(\\phi_L)) + \\beta_H(p_H - \\eta_1I(\\phi_H)) + \\Delta C$.\n(21)\nTo resolve the problem presented in (21) intuitively, we will derive its first and second derivations with respect to $I(\\phi_L)$ and $I(\\phi_H)$ as\n$\\frac{\\partial UE}{\\partial I(\\phi_L)} = \\frac{\\theta_L - \\beta_H\\theta_H}{I(\\phi_L) - I_{r1}} + \\beta_L(\\eta_3 - \\eta_1)$,\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 UE}{\\partial I(\\phi_L)^2} = -\\frac{\\theta_L - \\beta_H\\theta_H}{(I(\\phi_L) - I_{r1})^2},$\n(22)\nand"}, {"title": "VI. EXPERIMENT", "content": "In this section, we first present the system configuration and experiment benchmarks for our experiment in Section VI-A. Second, in Section VI-B, we conduct comprehensive experiments to assess the four evaluation metrics, i.e., the average utility of teleoperators and edge servers and the average response time and completion rate of AIGC tasks, versus the load of the offloading environment. Finally, in Section VI-C, we conduct experiments to investigate the impact of AIGC task difficulty assessment methods on these four evaluation metrics.\nA. Experiment configurations\n1) Experiment Parameters: We set the number of fog nodes to {20, 25, 30, 35, 40}. To estimate the real computational resource required by a low light enhancement AIGC task, we conducted a comprehensive experiment depicted in Fig. 7.\nFollowing (18), (19), (24), and (25), we can formulate the contract bundle, a.k.a the pricing strategy, for edge servers to provide differential AIGC service for teleoperator under information asymmetry.\nIt is worth noting that the formulated contract bundle possesses certain deficiencies. Specifically, the required performance of AIGC models, i.e., $I(\\phi_L)$ and $I(\\phi_H)$, cannot be promised, since $I(\\phi_L)$ and $I(\\phi_H)$ are fixed once the contract bundle is formulated and the actual performance of AIGC models are varying against AIGC tasks. Put another way, the AIGC task $T_n$ processed on the AIGC model trained with small and large datasets will purchase with $p_L$ and $p_H$ to acquire the actual performance score of $I_n(\\phi_L)'$ and $I_n(\\phi_H)'$, respectively. To this end, the difficulty assessment proposed in Section V-A should align as much as possible to the difficulty assessment solution obtained via revised contract bundle $(p_i, I_n(\\phi_i)')$, which we named as \"Oracle Solution\".\nThe \"Oracle Solution\" is defined as\n$\\begin{cases}d_n = 1, & \\text{if } UW_H(I_H', p_H) < UW_L(I_L', p_H), \\\\d_n = 2, & \\text{otherwise,}\\end{cases}$\n(26)\nwhere $I_L'$ and $I_H'$ are interchangeable with $I_n(\\phi_L)'$ and $I_n(\\phi_H)'$ for the sake of clarity.\nOrganizing (26), we can obtain the following proposition,\nProposition 1. The difficulty level of the AIGC tasks $T_n$ will assigned as 1, if the following inequality holds\n$\\eta_2 < \\frac{\\frac{\\theta_H - \\beta_H \\theta_H}{I_L' - I_{r1}}}{\\frac{\\theta_L - \\beta_H \\theta_H}{I_H' - I_{r1}}} < \\frac{C \\frac{p_L}{(\\eta_1 - \\eta_3)} - (I_H - I_L)}{\\frac{\\theta_L - \\beta_H \\theta_H}{I_L' - I_{r1}}}$\n(27)\nOtherwise, the difficulty level should assigned as 2.\nUpon formulation of the contract bundle and AIGC tasks difficulty level assessment, we can tackle problem (15a) to derive the AIGC task allocation scheme. Notably, problem (15a) considers only the task allocation, which is similar to the problem formulated in [30]. Therefore, we can utilize the method proposed in their work to solve our problem as well, so we will not reiterate the solution here.\nRemark: Due to our paper focused on utilizing VLM-empowered contract theory to assist AIGC task allocation, problem (15a) does not take channel, channel power, and computational resource allocation and the associated constraints into consideration. Nonetheless, our proposed method can integrate these into consideration at ease since the VLM-empowered contract theory only adds a constraint to the edge server selection, i.e., narrow the feasible offload set for AIGC task offloading."}, {"title": "VII.

In this study, high-throughput computational screening and machine learning were combined to reveal the iodine capture performance of 1816 metal-organic framework (MOF) materials under humid air conditions. Firstly, the relationship between the structural characteristics of MOF materials (including density, surface area and pore features) and their adsorption properties was explored, with the aim of identifying the optimal structural parameters for iodine capture. Subsequently, two machine learning regression algorithms - Random Forest and CatBoost, were employed to predict the iodine adsorption capabilities of MOF materials. In addition to 6 structural features, 25 molecular features (encompassing the types of metal and ligand atoms as well as bonding modes) and 8 chemical features (including heat of adsorption and Henry's coefficient) were incorporated to enhance the prediction accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Feature importance was assessed to determine the relative influence of various features on iodine adsorption performance, in which the Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption to iodine were found the two most crucial chemical factors. Furthermore, four types of molecular fingerprints were introduced for providing comprehensive and detailed structural information of MOF materials. The top 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were picked out, revealing that the presence of six-membered ring structures and nitrogen atoms in the MOF framework were the key structural factors that enhanced iodine adsorption, followed by the existence of oxygen atoms.

However, the rapid expansion of nuclear energy industry is accompanied by potential environmental and safety risks\u00b3, especially in the handling of nuclear waste and during nuclear accidents, where the leakage of radioactive substances poses a severe threat to both the environment and human health. Among the radioactive isotopes involved in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing or nuclear accidents, iodine isotopes, particularly 131I and 129I, are of particular concern due to their volatility and strong bioaccumulation, which result in significant long-term impacts on the environment and human health\u2074. The half-life of 131I is only 8 days; although its radiation is intense, the associated risks are generally short-term, primarily entering the human body via inhalation or the food chain, leading to acute health issues such as thyroid cancer. In contrast, 129I has an exceptionally long half-life (~1.57 \u00d7 107 years), enabling it to persist in the biosphere and cause sustained threats to ecosystems. Consequently, the efficient removal of radioactive iodine isotopes has become an urgent requirement for ensuring nuclear safety and reducing environmental contamination\u2075, \u2076, \u2077, \u2078.\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel porous materials formed by metal clusters coordinated with organic ligands, have gained considerable attention as potential iodine adsorbents due to their highly tunable structures, large surface areas, and excellent porosity\u2079, \u00b9\u2070. However, in the real nuclear industry and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, high-humidity air environments are prevalent, thus demanding more robust iodine adsorption properties from MOF materials\u2076, \u00b9\u00b9, \u00b9\u00b2. In recent years, many researchers have investigated the iodine adsorption behavior of various MOFs in humid environments: Tina M. Nenoff and co-workers explored the competitive I2 sorption by Cu-BTC from humid gas streams (about 3.5% relative humidity) at 75\u00b0C and ambient pressure, revealing a remarkable iodine capacity of ~175 wt% with a derived I2/H2O adsorption selectivity of 1.5\u00b9\u00b3. Praveen K. Thallapally's group reported I2 adsorption capacities and mechanisms in two microporous MOFs in the presence of humidity (33% RH and 43% RH), in which SBMOF-1 and SBMOF-2 exhibited the 15 wt% and 35 wt% uptake, respectively\u00b9\u2074. Zhang et al. systematically studied the influence of H2O molecules on the iodine adsorption properties of different zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, highlighting the competitive adsorption behavior between H2O and I2, particularly for hydrophilic materials\u00b9\u2075. Other MOF materials including MIL-101-Cr-TED, MIL-101-Cr-HMTA and ECUT-300, also were used to explore the iodine capture performance in a water-containing system\u00b9\u2076, \u00b9\u2077, \u00b9\u2078, \u00b9\u2079. In our previous work, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and density functional theory methods were employed to investigate the iodine adsorption performance of 21 chemically stable MOF materials in high-humidity environments, and influence of different structural factors were revealed\u00b2\u2070. However, despite these advances, researches on the iodine adsorption behavior of MOFs under humid conditions remains limited, and a comprehensive insight of the key factors influencing iodine adsorption based on a larger number of MOF materials is still needed.\nNowadys, high-throughput computational screening based on molecular simulations offers a rapid approach to evaluating the iodine adsorption performance of MOFs under humid conditions\u00b2\u00b9, \u00b2\u00b2. Furthermore, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has ushered in a new research paradigm that combines data science with chemistry\u00b2\u00b3, \u00b2\u2074. Machine learning has proven to be an efficient tool for analyzing computational data related to gas adsorption behaviors of MOFs, for revealing structure-property relationships, identifying promising MOF adsorbents and even guiding MOF structures design and modification\u00b2\u2075, \u00b2\u2076, \u00b2\u2077, \u00b2\u2078. In this work, we first selected 1816 I2-accessible MOF materials (with pore limiting diameter > 3.34 \u00c5 - the kinetic diameter of I2) from the well-established CORE MOF 2014 database established by Chuang et al.\u00b2\u2079, and employed GCMC simulations to study their I2 adsorption performance under humid air conditions\u00b3\u2070. Subsequently, three different types of descriptors (structural, molecular, and chemical features) were explored, and machine learning algorithms were utilized to predict iodine adsorption performance and reveal the relationships between various descriptors and iodine adsorption. Finally, molecular fingerprint technique was employed to comprehensively identify the influence of structural features on iodine adsorption, providing valuable insights for the future molecular design of MOF materials."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "To identify the optimal structural features, the relationships between the 1816 MOF structures and iodine adsorption performance were investigated in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1. Structural characteristics of MOFs included the pore limiting diameter (PLD), largest cavity diameter (LCD), void fraction (\u03c6), pore volume, surface area and density. When LCD was less than 4 \u00c5 (Fig. 1a), the spatial steric hindrance between the I2 molecules and the pore walls resulted in negligible iodine adsorption. When 4 \u00c5 < LCD < 5.5 \u00c5, an increase in LCD reduced the steric hindrance, thereby adsorption interaction between the framework materials and iodine molecules became the dominant factor, which led to an increase in both iodine adsorption capacity and selectivity. However, when LCD exceeded 5.5 \u00c5, further enlargement of the channel size diminished the interaction between MOFs and iodine molecules, which intensified the desorption of I2 in the pores and resulted in a continuous decline in both adsorption capacity and selectivity. To identify MOF materials with optimal iodine adsorption properties, we could find the ideal value for LCD lay between 4 and 7.8 \u00c5. As for porosity (with the optimal value for iodine adsorption less than 0.17) in Fig. 1b, iodine adsorption capacity and selectivity initially increased (p < 0.1) and then decreased (0.1 < \u03c6 < 0.6). The relationships between density and iodine adsorption performance also followed a similar trend (Fig. 1c): at low densities (under 0.9 g/cm\u00b3), the increase in density promoted iodine adsorption due to the greater number of available adsorption sites; however, when the density exceeded 0.9 g/cm\u00b3, excessively compact pore structures limited iodine adsorption, with the attraction interaction between the MOFs and I2 molecules changing to repulsion interaction; with the density further surpassing 2.2 g/cm\u00b3, iodine uptake amount would fall below 100 cm\u00b3/g. Furthermore, the optimal values of pore volume, PLD and surface area for iodine capture were also identified, which lay at the range of 0 ~ 0.18 cm\u00b3/g, 3.34 ~ 7 \u00c5 and 0 ~ 540 m\u00b2/g, respectively (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1). In order to facilitate the comparison of the adsorption behavior of different molecules, structure-performance relationships of MOF materials for H2O adsorption have been delineated (Fig. S2), in which the optimal structural parameters exhibited a broader range (for instance, the optimal LCD could reach up to 11 \u00c5 and the optimal \u03c6 could attain 0.48); this is likely attributed to the larger kinetic diameter of H2O molecules compared to I2. The above results explained that relatively small pore sizes of MOF materials could confer the advantage during competitive iodine adsorption in humid conditions."}, {"title": "Machine learning", "content": "After the aforementioned analysis, we initially employed six structural descriptors - PLD, LCD, \u03c6, pore volume, surface area and density, to train machine learning algorithms for predicting iodine gas adsorption in MOF materials under humid conditions (Fig. 2a, d). Two different machine learning algorithms (including random forest and CatBoost model) were trained and compared\u00b3\u00b9, \u00b3\u00b2. After training the model with only structural parameters as the simplest feature set, we gradually incorporated more comprehensive feature sets, including \"structural + molecular descriptors\" (Fig. 2b, e) and \"structural + molecular + chemical descriptors\" (Fig. 2c, f). For molecular descriptors, each molecular feature corresponded to specific elemental, hybridization, and bonding types. For carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) elements, the atomic types included C_1, C_2, C_3, and C_R (or N_1, N_2, N_3, and N_R), depending on the nature of single, double, triple, and ring bonds. Oxygen (O) atoms can form double bonds and ring bonds, defined as O_2 and O_R, respectively, as well as central tetrahedral oxygen (denoted as O_3_f) or central trigonal oxygen (denoted as O_2_z)\u00b3\u00b3. For hydrogen (H), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br), the atomic types are designated as H_, F_, Cl, and Br. Additionally, tetrahedral four-coordinate phosphorus for organo-metallic coordination is defined as P_3+q, along with sulfur atoms connected via cyclic bonds (denoted as S_R)\u00b3\u2074. Regarding metal atoms, only the predominant metal species within the MOF were considered: descriptors for these metals included metal ratio (the molar ratio relative to all atoms), atomic number, atomic weight, atomic radius, polarizability, electron affinity, and Mulliken electronegativity. In chemical descriptors, Henry's coefficient and heat of adsorption of I2, H2O, N2 and O2 in MOF materials were considered and defined as I2_Henry (I2_heat), H2O_Henry (H2O_heat), N2_Henry (N2_heat) and O2_Henry (O2_heat), respectively.\nThroughout the above process, the prediction performance of both the random forest and CatBoost algorithms progressively improved. The accuracy of the machine learning was evaluated using R\u00b2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). When only structural descriptors were used, the random forest algorithm exhibited a relatively low prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.438). After adding molecular descriptors to the feature set, the prediction accuracy of the random forest model improved, with R\u00b2 increasing to 0.592. Further incorporation of chemical descriptors led to the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.900). Simultaneously, the MAE and MSE values of random forest model demonstrated a steady decrease: MAE reduced from 75.588 to 61.673, and finally to 23.378; MSE decreased from 14,293.744 to 10387.059, and ultimately to 2547.433. For the CatBoost algorithm, the trends were similar to those observed with the random forest model, but overall, it exhibited better prediction performance. When using the \u201cstructural descriptors + molecular descriptors + chemical descriptors\" feature set, the CatBoost algorithm achieved the highest R2 of 0.941, with MAE and MSE dropping to 18.276 and 1512.681, respectively. Additionally, by following the above process, the accuracy of the CatBoost algorithm in predicting the H2O adsorption performance of MOF materials also gradually improved (Fig. S3), and the value of R2, MAE and MSE respectively reached 0.911, 5.672 and 166.554 based on \"structural descriptors + molecular descriptors + chemical descriptors\" feature set. This further confirmed that molecular and chemical descriptors significantly complemented the structural descriptors, playing a crucial role in accurately predicting gas molecules capture in MOF materials."}, {"title": "Molecular Fingerprint", "content": "In order to comprehensively reveal the factors that positively or negatively influenced iodine adsorption performance, thereby paving the way for future molecular design, four types of molecular fingerprint (including Molecular ACCess Systems (MACCS), PubChem, AtomPairs2D and Estate fingerprint) were employed in place of the previously used molecular descriptors. MACCS and PubChem represented two of the most widely used fingerprint derived from substructure key information: the MACCS fingerprint consisted of a set of 166 structural keys, constructed using SMART patterns; while the PubChem fingerprint originated from the PubChem database, encompassing 881 types of structural keys represented as binary substructure encodings. The APFP fingerprint encoded a total of 780 atomic pairs based on their topological distances. Estate summarized the microscopic structure of materials through a 79-byte representation. Based on the presence or absence of bits, molecular fingerprint digitized the molecular features of MOF materials, thereby providing microscopic insights into the structure of exceptional materials. These molecular fingerprints, in conjunction with previous structural and chemical descriptors, were applied to train machine learning models for the prediction of iodine adsorption performance under humid conditions. Although the prediction performance showed a slight decrease based on \"structure + molecular fingerprint + chemical descriptors\" set compared to the prior \"structure + molecular + chemical descriptors\" set, because the encoding of molecular fingerprint solely indicated the presence or absence of specific features and other information such as the quantity or proportion in a single MOF unit cell were missed, which limited their ability in prediction of uptake amount; however, their comprehensive inclusion of various structural categories enabled them to serve as excellent interpretative tools.\nAfter comparing the prediction accuracies of the four molecular fingerprints (Fig. 5a and Fig. S7), MACCS molecular fingerprint exhibited its superiority in machine learning (R2 = 0.927, MAE = 20.057, and MSE = 1651.391). The 20 most significant MACCS molecular fingerprints were ranked and accompanied by detailed interpretations (Fig. 5b and Table S1). Additionally, the autocorrelation coefficients of the molecular fingerprints were presented in the heatmap to reveal the interrelationships among the fingerprints (Fig. S8). The top two, Bit_158 and Bit_75, demonstrated the significant positive impact of nitrogen (N) atoms in MOF materials on iodine adsorption performance. The strong correlations between Bit_158 and Bit_156 (with correlation coefficient of 0.9), and between Bit_158 and Bit_45 (with correlation coefficient of 0.73) further highlighted that the presence of N atoms, whether in rings or directly bonded to carbon (C) atoms, promoted the iodine adsorption in humid air conditions. Bit_163 and Bit_162, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.6, represented that six-membered aromatic ring was another important structural feature. Six-membered aromatic ring likely provided electron-rich adsorption sites due to their large \u03c0-bonds, thereby enhancing the iodine adsorption. Bit_6 and Bit_12, which were associated with the type of metal, represented lanthanide metal and group IB (or IIB) metal elements, respectively. The negative correlation (-0.38) between these two molecular fingerprints arose from the relatively homogeneous nature of the metal clusters in these materials; however, the former demonstrated a negative effect on I2 adsorption, while the latter had a positive impact (consistent with previous findings, where a negative correlation was observed between the metal atomic radius and iodine adsorption performance). The relationships between MACCS molecular fingerprint and other structural (or chemical) features were also illustrated (Fig. S8). It could be found that although Bit_6 (lanthanide metals) and Bit_12 (group IB/IIB metals) showed little correlation with I2_Henry and I2_Heat, Bit_6 enhanced the adsorption of H2O in MOF materials (correlation coefficient with H2O_Heat of 0.65), while Bit_12 weakened the adsorption of H2O (correlation coefficient with H2O_Heat of -0.41); thus, it could be concluded that group IB/IIB metals played the significant role in promoting competitive adsorption of I2 under humid conditions compared to lanthanide metals.\nFurthermore, the MACCS fingerprints Bit_138, Bit_69, Bit_100 and Bit_131, representing different forms of hydrogen (H) (whether connected to C or non-C elements), and Bit_143 and Bit_139, representing different forms of oxygen (O) (either as part of a ring structure or as hydroxyl groups), all demonstrated the positive role of H and O atoms in enhancing iodine adsorption in MOF structures. Nevertheless, modifications involving N atoms appeared to offer the greater advantages over O atoms (Overall, Bit_158 and Bit_75 had the higher importance ranking compared to Bit_143 and Bit_139). This was because the existence of N atoms, compared to O atoms, exerted the evident suppressive effect on both pore size and the adsorption of H2O molecules, both of which were more favorable for iodine adsorption in humid environments; specifically, the correlation coefficients between N-related molecular fingerprints (Bit_158, Bit_75, Bit_156, and Bit_45) and pore volume were -0.27, -0.28, -0.26, and -0.26, respectively, and their correlations with H\u2082O_Heat were -0.12, -0.18, -0.13, and -0.17; in contrast, O-related molecular fingerprints (Bit_143 and Bit_139) had the positive correlation coefficients with pore volume of 0.2 and 0.046, respectively, and correlation coefficients with H2O_Heat were 0.24 and 0.029. The role of H atoms lay between that of the N and O atoms: the correlation coefficients between H-related molecular fingerprints (Bit_138, Bit_69, Bit_100 and Bit_131) and pore volume were at the range of -0.1 ~ -0.2, and the correlation with H\u2082O_Heat were also weak (with negative correlation coefficients less than -0.1)."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In summary, large-scale GCMC simulations were employed to investigate iodine adsorption performance (including adsorption capacity and selectivity) for 1816 MOF materials from CoRE MOF database under humid conditions. Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and CatBoost, were utilized to predict the iodine adsorption performance of MOF materials, gradually incorporating three different types of descriptors to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models: 6 structural features (including pore characteristics, density, and surface area), 25 molecular features (including the types of metal and ligand atoms as well as their bonding modes), and 8 chemical features (including adsorption heat and Henry's coefficient). SHAP method was used to rank the importance of these descriptors, and correlation coefficients were employed to reveal the relationships among features. Four types of molecular fingerprints were also generated in place of molecular features and combined with the CatBoost algorithm to predict iodine adsorption performance. The top 20 MACCS molecular fingerprints were extracted, demonstrating the most significant role of six-membered rings and N atoms in MOF materials, followed by O atoms. Among the metal sites, the lighter transition metal elements were found to be more favorable for iodine adsorption compared to lanthanide elements. This comprehensive and systematic study shed light on the iodine adsorption performance of MOF materials under humid conditions, providing valuable insights for the future screening and design of high-performance MOF materials."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "GCMC simulations were employed using RASPA software to investigate the adsorption behavior of I2 within the MOFs at an environment of 423 K and 1 bar. The temperature of 423 K was relevant to operational conditions in the nuclear industry6, 35, 36. To replicate the high humidity environment encountered during the post-treatment phase of spent nuclear fuel, the mixed gas system was composed of 300 ppm I2, 68.5% N2, 18.4% O2, and 12.2% H2O, achieving a relative humidity of 100%. Throughout the simulation, the MOFs were treated as fixed rigid structures with periodic boundary conditions. Supercells were utilized as necessary to ensure that the system dimensions exceeded twice the cutoff distance (12 \u00c5). In addition, the selectivity of I2 during adsorption was calculated as the following equation8, 36:\nselectivity$_{I2}$ = $\\frac{X_{I2}/Y_{I2}}{X_{others}/Y_{others}}$\nwhere $X_{I2}$ and $Y_{I2}$ denoted the uptake amounts and gas phase concentration of I2; $X_{others}$ and $Y_{others}$ were the uptake amounts and gas phase concentration of other gas components (N2, O2 and H2O).\nAll GCMC simulations comprised an equilibration phase of 50,000 cycles, followed by a production phase of 50,000 cycles. Each cycle involved the movement of all adsorbed molecules, encompassing the insertion, deletion, translation, rotation, reinsertion, identity change, and swap processes. Iodine molecules were modeled as spherical entities, with van der Waals parameters derived from the viscosity of pure iodine37. Water molecules were represented using the transferable intermolecular potential (TIP3P) model ($r_{OH}$ = 0.9527 \u00c5 and \u03b8\u2220HOH = 104.52\u00b0), which was a model empirically validated to accurately describe hydrogen bonding interactions38, 39. N2 and O2 molecules were modeled as three-site representation40, 41. The relevant molecular model parameters were referenced from previous published work20. The Universal Force Field (UFF) was employed to establish the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters for the MOF structures42. Interatomic interactions were described using LJ and electrostatic potential energy functions as below:\n$U(r_{ij}) = \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} 4\\epsilon_{ij} [(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{12} - (\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{6}] + \\sum_{i}\\sum_{j} \\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}r_{ij}}$\nwhere $U(r_{ij})$ denoted the non-bonded interaction energy between atoms i and j; the first term represented the van der Waals non-bonded potential energy, and the second term accounted for the Coulombic electrostatic interaction energy. $r_{ij}$ signified the interatomic distance, $\u03c3_{ij}$ was the depth of the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential well, $q_{i}$ and $q_{j}$ represented the partial charges of atoms i and j, respectively, and $\u03b5_{0}$ was the vacuum dielectric constant."}, {"title": "Material descriptors", "content": "For structural descriptors, PLD and LCD were computed using the Zeo++ software package, based on Voronoi tessellation43.

Meanwhile, the surface area, pore volume, and density were determined by RASPA using nitrogen molecules (kinetic diameter = 3.64 \u00c5) as probes.

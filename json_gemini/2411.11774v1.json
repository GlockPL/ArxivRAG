This complexity raises concerns about trustworthiness, impacting safe and effective adoption of such technologies. Improved understanding of decision-making processes and requirements for explanations coming from decision support tools is a vital component in providing effective explainable solutions. This is particularly relevant in the data-intensive, fast-paced environments of intensive care units (ICUs). To explore these issues, group interviews were conducted with seven ICU clinicians, representing various roles and experience levels. Thematic analysis revealed three core themes: (T1) ICU decision-making relies on a wide range of factors, (T2) the complexity of patient state is challenging for shared decision-making, and (T3) requirements and capabilities of Al decision support systems. We include design recommendations from clinical input, providing insights to inform future AI systems for intensive care.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Intensive care units (ICUs) support patients with the highest medical care requirements in hospitals, and out of necessity, generate huge amounts of rich healthcare data [5]. AI systems are increasingly being developed to assimilate existing data sources and create models to support decisions, aiming to aid ICU clinicians in their work [25, 17]. Many of these systems are developed for safety-critical decisions, yet are not human interpretable. Hence, their deployment is met with justifiable scepticism amongst clinical teams [9], and the implementation and adoption of such systems in clinical practice often fail [28].\nExplainable AI (XAI) aims to bridge the gap, enabling human users to understand decisions from these systems. A wide range of xAI tools have been developed [23], largely tailored towards AI experts and practitioners. There is a lack of understanding of clinicians' requirements for such tools and it is unclear how these tools should be integrated into intensive care workflows [15]. Additionally, legislation such as the recent EU's AI Act [6] is paving the way for individuals to access explanations of the decisions generated by these automated systems [21]. Further work is required to ensure that xAI tools fit the needs of healthcare professionals within intensive care[15], both to support their acceptance and to maximise their effectiveness in explaining the outputs of AI decision support systems. Our work seeks to understand the requirements of ICU healthcare professionals in the design and implementation of xAI tools within AI decision support systems. We are guided by two research questions:\nRQ1: How do clinicians currently use data and decision support systems to formulate and explain decisions in intensive care?\nRQ2: What requirements do clinicians have for the design and implementation of explainable AI decision support systems in intensive care?"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The ICU is a hectic environment, requiring optimal communication and constant recording of bio-signals and medical events. High quantities of data are concurrently generated and stored in computer systems, which are later analysed by clinicians to make \u2013 often quick \u2013 decisions. Multiple research studies have been proposed to facilitate the difficulties that arise in the ICU with data-driven solutions [18, 15, 1]. Several works have explored the use of AI within the ICU [24, 15], which highlights that AI can \u201cenhance the accuracy, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of medical diagnosis\" [1]. However, the explainability aspects of AI recommendations in the clinical setting are still in the early stages. Explainability has been recognised as a critical component in integrating AI with clinical decision-making [14], and is particularly important for the safety-critical nature of intensive care decisions. Initial studies on the explainability of Al systems within the ICU [18, 15] focus on a range of different prediction tasks, predominantly readmission [13, 11, 12] and mortality prediction [10, 3] with promising results in terms of predictive performance and feature importance explanation. However, they usually rely on off-the-shelf and domain-agnostic xAI toolboxes [2, 26], using techniques such as Shapley Additive Explanations [16] and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations [22], but they overlook the human interaction element. Panigutti et al. [20] argues that participatory approaches are a vital component in developing xAI, as effective AI decision support requires explanations based on the end-users' needs.\nDrawing from participatory design research for interventions in the ICU, several works provide insights on contextual challenges within the ICU, highlighting the cognitively demanding nature of the ICU [8, 7] and co-designing low-risk AI concepts to promote easier adoption [28]. However, these works focus on general system requirements, rather than information requirements for effective use of AI suggestions. Orth et al. [19] consider general information requirements for intensive care decision-making, such as the need for patient history and comprehensible information, and explores the implications on AI. Our paper builds on this work but focuses on system requirements for AI explanations by exploring the information requirements of ICU clinicians."}, {"title": "3 Expert Interview Study", "content": "To better understand decision-based workflows in intensive care, and to gather clinicians' perspectives on both current decision-making processes and requirements of xAI decision support tools, we conducted semi-structured interviews with clinicians working in the ICU at a large teaching hospital in Bristol, UK. We invited seven clinicians working in several different roles within the ICU to participate in one of two semi-structured group interview sessions. Both interview sessions were conducted virtually using Microsoft Teams. Participants were recruited through word-of-mouth using expert sampling, to cover as wide a range of clinical roles as possible within the ICU. These roles included an anaesthetist trainee, intensive therapy nurse, and outreach nurse. No consultants were recruited due to staffing issues, as acknowledged in the limitations section. To preserve their anonymity, we refer to them by their general roles: Resident Doctors (D) and Nurses (N). Each participant provided their informed consent before the start of the study\u00b9."}, {"title": "3.1 Structure of the Interview Sessions", "content": "At the beginning of the session, all seven participants introduced themselves, before being introduced to the four study facilitators, and were briefed on how the interview sessions would be conducted. Following the briefing, participants"}, {"title": "3.2 Analysis", "content": "Analysis of the interview transcripts was performed by the four facilitators using reflexive thematic analysis [4]. A primarily inductive approach was taken, with codes generated through an open-coding process for text related to our research questions. For each group interview session, two authors independently coded the transcripts, before iteratively developing and agreeing on a shared code book. Once code books had been created for each session, the four facilitators collectively analysed and refined all codes from both sessions into a single combined code book. Following the synthesis of the combined code book, the four facilitators and an additional AI researcher collaboratively and iteratively generated themes from the codes and quotes. The resulting themes were reviewed to ensure they provided an accurate and complete representation of the data, and that they aligned with our research questions."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Through thematic analysis, we identified three themes pertinent to our research questions. In this section, we present details of each theme, substantiated by quotes taken from the interview transcripts. Some of the quotes we present have been edited to increase readability.

Five of the participants raised that care planning and understanding a patient's journey are crucial in guiding treatment decisions, especially when considering escalation or comfort care. \u201cEscalation planning\" was brought up by N1, N2, and N3, with N1 emphasising the need for it in cases of deterioration: \u201cwould they need more ventilation...etcetera\u201d. N4 stressed the importance of establishing \"a direction of travel\", whether it be full treatment or a palliative approach because \u201cthey're two very different platters of options\". Patient history also plays a vital role in decision-making, as N3 noted, where past experiences influence discharge timing: \"a patient who's been to intensive care three or four times previous to this and has keep coming back from the ward back to intensive care... we're a bit more reluctant to send them as soon as those vital numbers are correct, as we might do with another patient who's maybe postoperative for the first time\u201d (N3).\nThe significance of recent data and the patient's current trajectory were raised. N1 highlighted the importance of flagging potential issues, for example \"a recent blood result... [such as] a really raised potassium\u201d, to reassess decision-making, and that \u201cthe trajectory of [a patient's] long-term illness\" will factor into clinical decisions. D3 pointed out that \"it really depends on the context and causes of the deterioration\", which informs whether further intervention is appropriate, adding that \"everyone wants to make sure it's the right choice having seen that the patient has remained stable for at least 24 hours\"."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Patient Physiological Data.", "content": "Monitoring patient physiological data plays a crucial role in clinical decisions, such as readiness for discharge, with participants highlighting the need for patients to meet specific physiological requirements. N3 explained that \"the numbers being right are kind of stage 1 because otherwise they'll leave the unit and [immediately get flagged for readmission]\u201d. Which measurements are most important can be specific to the diagnosis, as D1 noted: every patient comes with a different pathology and therefore we're going to be looking at slightly different parameters for each one\u201d. However, even for the same pathology, what is considered a normal value varies between patients: \"So, you say, okay, a normal blood pressure is 120 / 80, except that for certain groups of patients, that's absolutely abnormal.\u201d (N4).\nCategorising data by organ systems was discussed, with D2 suggesting that this could help track complex cases, as \"pretty much every problem you can categorise as one of those [organ] systems\". D2 went on to say: \"I often find myself going through the charts kind of totting up organ systems and totting up problems to kind of explain to myself what's happening with a patient.\u201d (D2). Participants brought up the importance of looking at data trends rather than isolated data points. As noted by D3: \"it's all about the trend... has it improved\u201d. \u201cThere's obviously a lot of data that we collect and sometimes it's easier to see that as a trend\u201d D1 stated, and noted specifically, the importance of trends \"getting or approaching ready for discharge\" (D1). This approach helps clinicians make informed decisions regarding patient progression."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Importance of End-of-Bed Information.", "content": "While physiological data is critical, participants emphasised that it is often insufficient to form a complete picture of a patient's condition. D2 highlighted that \"you need to stand at the end of the bed, [and] look at the patient\" to assess whether the patient can be safely managed outside of intensive care. Behavioural factors were deemed to be difficult to capture in data, as D2 noted using the example of patients experiencing delirium, \u201cthey're needing constant ... physical and verbal intervention to manage their behaviour and keep them safe\". Visual assessments, such as inviting senior staff to \u201ceyeball\u201d the patient (N2) and assess \u201chow the patient looks clinically\u201d (N3), were seen as invaluable for decision planning. This was echoed by D3, who explained that seeing the patient over time can provide reassurance by providing information \u201cyou can get from end of bed by just looking at the patient and assessing them that you can't necessarily from the computer\".\""}, {"title": "4.1.4 Operational Factors.", "content": "As part of their decision-making process, clinicians must consider the wider hospital system:\nN2: \"[Hospital] flow is generally a real big problem for us ... so finding that appropriate ward is\ndifficult....

N4 highlighted how the acceptance of AI decision support systems will be influenced by how recommendations are framed. For example, participants felt that presenting a recommendation as \u201coptions available to you\" would support increased uptake compared to presenting the same recommendation as \u201cyou should do this": "Clinicians were also interested in leveraging organ systems in the explanations of an AI decision support system: \u201cso, it could almost be a flag saying this patient is being held up by brain and cardiovascular\u201d (D2), with D1 agreeing with the suggestion.\nD1 also indicated that lists of supporting factors would be more beneficial than just recommendations as \u201cif the system is consistently saying 'this patient is dischargeable, this patient can go to the ward', I'm not going to trust it in the same way than if it's it uses terminology like 'these factors support that this patient is suitable for discharge'.", "alerts": "nD3: \"if a computer just would give me an alert...

However, whilst clinicians see the benefit of decision-making systems, there are concerns that decision-making systems can lead to obscuring the judgment of the clinicians and the introduction of bias.

As patients are often managed by multiple care teams, this introduces inherent variability in the information that clinicians have at any point in time, and in how different clinicians perceive the state and requirements of patients.\nParticipants highlighted that this variability is particularly relevant in patient handover and collaborative decision-making contexts, in which information on the state of the patient needs to be communicated between clinicians. Participants also highlighted that the need for first-hand observation and validation of a patient's current state by individual clinicians can introduce delays in decisions being made or actioned. In the case of patient handover, participants described the use of the SBAR tool, which aims to mitigate this problem by providing a framework by which clinicians can quickly communicate key information about patients. Similarly, xAI tools that can provide simple overviews and evidenced recommendations relating to individual patients during inter-clinician interactions has the potential to further expedite collaborative processes such as patient handover.\nAs well as the distributed nature of patient care across multiple care teams, variability between clinicians in the information they have about patients can be caused by missed data. Participants valued AI-generated decision recommendations as an opportunity to consider specific pieces of patient information and alternative decision options that they may not have otherwise considered. However, there was also concern that such recommendations could introduce unwanted bias by unconsciously limiting further thought into alternatives not presented by the system."}, {"title": "5.3 Design Recommendations", "content": "Based on our findings, we present several recommendations for the design of xAI tools for AI decision support systems in intensive care, and discuss how these can support the integration and acceptance of such tools in clinical practice."}, {"title": "5.3.1 Minimise cognitive load: integrate into existing systems and include multiple levels of detail with layered explanations.", "content": "As highlighted by several participants, minimizing cognitive load is a crucial factor in the delivery of patient care within ICU.

To facilitate attendance, interviews were conducted virtually which may have affected engagement, such as with the whiteboard, and interaction between participants during the interviews.

Better integrating such systems into clinicians' existing decision-making processes will provide improved decision support, facilitating improved patient care whilst minimising additional cognitive load."}]}

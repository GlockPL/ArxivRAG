Introduction", "content": "The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced significant cyclical growth, known as AI summers and winters. At present, we as a community find ourselves in the third AI summer, marked by rapid scientific advances and commercialization, continuing the legacy of previous periods of AI excitement followed by setbacks [1]. A significant product of the third AI summer has been the integration of two prominent fields of AI; Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI, the fusion of which is known as Neuro-Symbolic AI. There is an ongoing debate about the necessity of Neuro-Symbolic AI [2], opponents arguing that common sense reasoning can be addressed through the use of big data [3] and proponents arguing that \"You can't get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees\u201d [4]. For this systematic review, we take the stance that symbolic AI is essential and that Neuro-Symbolic AI represents the best way forward for the community hence, this paper provides a systematic literature review of prominent Neuro-Symbolic projects within the 2024 AI landscape, highlighting key developments, methodologies, and applications."}, {"title": "1.1. Symbolic Al", "content": "Symbolic AI is a \u201ca sub-field of AI concerned with learning the internal symbolic representations of the world around it\u201d where we can \u201c translate some form of implicit human knowledge into a more formalized and declarative form based on rules and logic\" [2]. Examples of some of the earliest AI systems that utilised symbolic representations include SHRDLU [5], ELIZA [6], DENDRAL [7] and MYCIN [8] and examples of some of the newest AI systems which heavily utilise symbolic processes include ConceptNet 5.5 [9] CYC [10] and Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI) planning systems [11] to name just a few."}, {"title": "1.2. Sub-Symbolic Al", "content": "By contrast, Sub-Symbolic AI are systems that \u201cdo not require rules or symbolic representations as inputs\" and instead \u201clearn implicit data representations on their own\u201d [2]. Sub-Symbolic AI encompasses approaches such as machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, which rely on algorithms to automatically extract patterns from raw data to discern relationships and make predictions based on learned representations. Examples of some of the earliest AI systems that utilised sub-symbolic representations include the Perceptron [12], Hopfield Networks [13] and the Backpropagation Algorithm [14] and examples of some of the newest sub-symbolic systems include famous projects such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models [15], the YOLO family of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN'S) [16] and the DALLE diffusion model transformer [17] to again just name a few."}, {"title": "1.3. Neuro-Symbolic Al", "content": "There is at present a debate within the AI community surrounding the need for Neuro-Symbolic AI [18]. Simply described, the argument for Neuro-Symbolic AI draws on Kahneman (2011) [19] concepts of System 1 and System 2 thinking whereby System 1 is fast, intuitive, and parallel, akin to the capabilities of deep learning, while System 2 is slow, deliberate, and sequential,"}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Taxonomy of Neuro-Symbolic Al", "content": "We identified five foundational research areas advancing the state of the art in Neuro-Symbolic AI. This taxonomy was synthesized from a review of six survey papers [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25] and four seminal books [2, 26, 27, 28]. These areas are:\n1. Knowledge Representation: Integrating symbolic and neural representations and developing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge graphs [20, 26, 28].\n2. Learning and Inference: Combining learning and reasoning processes through end-to-end differentiable reasoning and dynamic multi-source knowledge reasoning [21, 22, 2].\n3. Explainability and Trustworthiness: Creating interpretable models and reasoning processes to ensure trust and reliability in Neuro-Symbolic systems [23, 24].\n4. Logic and Reasoning: Integrating logic-based methods with neural networks, including logical and probabilistic reasoning, and the syntax and semantics of Neuro-Symbolic systems [23, 28].\n5. Meta-Cognition: The system's capacity to monitor, evaluate, and adjust its own reasoning and learning processes by integrating neural networks and symbolic representations.\nThe four above categories represent the core technical areas where current efforts are concentrated. Additionally, we define Meta-Cognition to address a gap in current taxonomies that fail to capture fields encompassing self-awareness, adaptive learning, reflective reasoning, self-regulation, and introspective monitoring."}, {"title": "2.2. Meta-Cognition", "content": "Meta-Cognition refers to the processes that involve thinking about one's thinking, enabling self-awareness and self-regulation in cognitive tasks. Meta-Cognition is the controller that sits above the cognitive tasks of systems to direct energy effectively towards the correct system to handle a task. This higher-order cognition is crucial for tasks that require reflection, planning, and adaptation. Its importance lies in its ability to enhance learning, problem-solving, and"}, {"title": "2.3. Literature Review Approach", "content": "We followed the PRISMA systematic review methodology to ensure a thorough and unbiased survey of the literature. Our search was conducted across five databases: IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM Digital Library, and SpringerLink Library, focusing on publications from 2020 to 2024. The keywords included \"Neuro-Symbolic\" combined with terms related to the foundational research areas. Only peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and books in English were considered. From an initial broad search, we refined our selection to 392 candidate papers, which were further screened for quality, relevance, and availability of a public codebase, resulting in 167 papers that were included in our review.

Discussion & Open Questions", "content": "To build upon the existing literature that has thoroughly summarized the Neuro-Symbolic landscape before 2020, we extend this discussion by analyzing the most influential projects in each sub-field of Neuro-Symbolic AI published since 2020. This section aims to highlight state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies available to researchers, showcasing significant advancements and ongoing challenges."}, {"title": "4.1. Knowledge Representation", "content": "Research in Knowledge Representation has focused on advancing semantic grounding, representing complex relationships, and improving data efficacy. Development of commonsense knowledge bases and event-based representations [107, 105, 106] has advanced Al's understanding of daily events, aiming to reduce error rates in text generation. These works are furthered through the exploration of minimal data requirements for commonsense knowledge in few-shot learning models [110], and the use of Neuro-Symbolic representations to enhance training efficiency and reduce costs [163]. Additionally, refinement of knowledge representation was demonstrated by predicting complex relationships and embedding techniques in knowledge graphs [111, 109], and the integration of personalized knowledge was demonstrated to ensure narrative consistency in storytelling agents [131]. NeuroQL, a domain-specific language for inter-subjective reasoning, captured complex and long-range relationships, demonstrating how Neuro-Symbolic approaches can 'do more with less', yielding significant savings in training time and environmental impact [108]. Open research questions remain around how Neuro-Symbolic AI can enhance the dynamic interpretation and manipulation of symbols, develop meta-cognitive abilities to monitor and adjust reasoning processes, and ensure transparent, explainable reasoning pathways for more human-like, adaptable, and robust knowledge representation."}, {"title": "4.2. Learning and Inference", "content": "Within Learning and Inference, research has focused on Neuro-Symbolic Integration for Enhanced Learning, Advanced Problem Solving and Decision Making, and Semantic Enhancement for Model Trustworthiness. Neuro-Symbolic integration for Enhanced Learning was demonstrated through the fusion of symbolic reasoning with neural learning mechanisms which adapted commonsense knowledge for few-shot settings and transformed observations into logical facts using Logical Neural Networks [84, 64]. Advanced Problem Solving and Decision Making are highlighted by Plan-SOFAI [92] and the ZeroC architecture [162], which leverage Neuro-Symbolic methods to enhance AI planning and zero-shot concept recognition to integrate"}, {"title": "4.3. Explainability and Trustworthiness", "content": "Research centred on Explainability and Trustworthiness within Neuro-Symbolic AI has looked to advance Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques, Enhancing Logical Reasoning, and Refining Language Understanding and Summarization. Braid introduced a logical reasoner with probabilistic rules to tackle the brittle matching problem, merging symbolic and neural knowledge to enhance logical reasoning [119]. Similarly, Structure-Aware Abstractive Conversation improved summarization by incorporating discourse relations, action triples, and structured graphs for precise, context-rich summaries, advancing NLP techniques [117]. Semantic-level revisions identifying and correcting \u201cconfounders\u201d in Neuro-Symbolic scenes have improved AI decision-making clarity, fostering trust and enhancing logical reasoning by making processes more understandable [168]. Evaluating Al's humour comprehension with the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest underscored the need for nuanced understanding, refining language processing in complex cognitive tasks [118]. FactPEGASUS focuses on ensuring factuality in summarization by optimizing pre-training and fine-tuning methods, crucial for maintaining summary integrity and refining language understanding [136]. Complementing this, Neuro-Symbolic methods enhance explainable short answer grading through logical reasoning and cue detection, bridging AI capabilities with human-like responses and advancing NLP techniques [121]. Open research questions remain around how Neuro-Symbolic AI can adapt and evolve symbolic representations in real-time to maintain transparency, integrate meta-cognitive mechanisms for self-monitoring and adjustment of reasoning strategies, develop explainable NLP techniques for complex cognitive tasks, and ensure factual consistency in AI outputs while providing clear, detailed explanations of the underlying reasoning process."}, {"title": "4.4.

Intersections of the above four research areas", "content": "Much of the literature is cross-sectional between the four areas of research; Explainability & Trustworthiness, Knowledge Representation, Learning & Inference and Logic & Reasoning. AlphaGeometry [29], which is a Neuro-Symbolic system designed to solve Euclidean plane geometry problems at the Olympiad level, stands out as a prominent project that sits at the intersection of all four. AlphaGeometry's ability to synthesise millions of theorems and proofs, using a neural language model trained on large-scale synthetic data to guide a symbolic deduction engine, makes it a groundbreaking example of how Neuro-Symbolic AI can achieve advanced problem-solving capabilities, bridging gaps across multiple domains of AI research. However, there is a distinct lack of integration with the explainability and trustworthiness fields within the unions of the other three research areas as the density of research intersection at the unions of explainability and trustworthiness and the other three research areas is relatively sparse, indicating a significant opportunity for further interdisciplinary work in Neuro-Symbolic AI."}, {"title": "4.6. Meta-Cognition", "content": "Recent advancements in this domain showcase Reinforcement learning (RL) to approximate Meta-Cognition, approaches to integrate cognitive architectures with LLMs to approximate meta-cognitive capabilities and the integration of many AI architectures and systems to demonstrate the Common Model of Cognition (CMC). The benefits of integrating symbolic features with RL algorithms were demonstrated through meta-reinforcement learning combined with logical program induction to improve financial trading strategies [175]. Enhancing general intelligence by fusing cognitive architectures with LLMs was investigated, creating embodied agents that leverage the strengths of both approaches [171, 172]. Improvements in experiential models were achieved by using LLMs to convert descriptive information into dense signals for instance-based learning [173]. Adaptive conflict resolution in Al was enhanced by coupling cognitive reasoning with generative algorithms [174]. Robust AI systems were developed through modular, agency,"}, {"title": "5. Meta-Cognition in Neuro-Symbolic Al", "content": "Whilst the initial representation of Neuro-Symbolic AI as system 1 and system 2 level thinking is a useful tool to goal-orientate the field towards a common direction for the integration of neural and symbolic processes, the current adaptation of the human-level cognitive processing ability is too simplistic and does not yet capture the full systems-level breakdown of where the community should be investing effort to push the field forward. As Kahneman himself states, \u201cthe two systems do not really exist in the brain or anywhere else. 'System 1 does X' is a shortcut for 'X occurs automatically.' And 'System 2 is mobilized to do Y' is a shortcut for 'arousal increases, pupils dilate, attention is focused, and activity Y is performed.\". Human-level cognition manifests from a deeply complex and intricately layered yet densely connected box of systems of systems that work in unification and act with system-1 system-2 characteristics. The goal of the Neuro-Symbolic research domain is to \u201ccreate a superior hybrid AI model possessing reasoning capabilities\u201d and hence, to push the field further towards this goal we must seek to design and build systems that act with the same propensity as Kahnemans system-1 system-2 character setup through the implementation of more integrated systems of systems controlled through Meta-Cognition possessing the ability to act lazily when necessary and focused when required."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "The field of Neuro-Symbolic AI has experienced a notable surge in research activity from 2020 onwards, reflecting the growing recognition of the importance of integrating symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches to enhance Al's reasoning capabilities.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The Internet of vehicles (IoV) plays a critical role in facilitating an efficient and reliable intelligent transportation system, where high-speed communication and high-precision sensing serve as fundamental pillars [2]. In contrast to conventional separated systems, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) holds the promise of mutual enhancement, thus garnering significant attention in recent research endeavors within the realm of vehicular networks [3].\nTo achieve ISAC, waveform design serves as one of the core techniques. Existing dual-functional waveform designs are typically categorized into three types: communication-centric, radar-centric, and joint design. Communication-centric designs focus on enhancing sensing based on existing communication waveforms [4, 5]. However, the sensing capability is inherently limited due to the unregulated auto-correlation properties of communication symbols. In radar-centric designs, information is embedded into radar waveform parameters such as carrier frequency and antenna assignment [6, 7]. Nevertheless, these designs are constrained by radar pulse repetition rate, failing to satisfy the high-rate requirements in practical communications. To improve the sensing accuracy while guaranteeing communications, joint precoding designs by shaping the beam into desired patterns have been widely researched [8-10]. For instance [8] achieved the desired pattern by optimizing the precoding, satisfying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint at the user. [10] achieved a higher sensing SNR while guaranteeing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at users by jointly optimizing the precoding for communication and radar signal.\nHowever, the dynamic nature of the road environment introduces both time-varying characteristics in the wireless channel and rapid movement of the targets, presenting a doubly-dynamic challenge for ISAC. To deal with the time-varying channels, [11] proposed a compressive sensing (CS)-based framework with specialized pilot, reducing the time overhead in channel state information (CSI) acquisition. [12, 13] designed pre-compensators to combat the Doppler effect, mitigating the inter-carrier interference (ICI) in wideband systems. [14] further decoupled the Doppler shifts in angle domain by precoding to effectively suppress the time-variation of communications. In terms of sensing the fast-moving targets, [15] utilized CSI to estimate the target's velocities, and [16] designed Space-Delay-Doppler precoding by leveraging ICI to enhance the sensing accuracy. Meanwhile, to address the carrier frequency offset resulting from the sensing dynamics, [17] designed a Kalman filter (KF)-based sensing scheme using the estimated Doppler as a prior to filter out time-varying noise and enhance sensing accuracy.\nNevertheless, implementing ISAC under double dynamics remains unexplored and presents unique challenges. Firstly, the complex correlation between the dynamics of communications and sensing can lead to degraded spectrum efficiency (SE) and sensing accuracy. Secondly, existing optimization-based methods are complex and result in high latency, while the need for perfect environmental information such as instantaneous CSI and real-time target positions can be difficult to acquire in double dynamics.\nIn an effort to lower the dependence on instantaneous state information and mitigate the complexity issue, [18, 19] predicted the real-time environmental prior according to the historical positions, via particle filter (PF) and message passing (MP) respectively. The operating protocol have also been modified for facilitating the predictive precoding. However, these solutions still struggle to address the doubly-dynamic challenge, as they lack robustness in managing the mutual interference between communication and sensing. Moreover, their complexity escalates drastically with a growing number of users, thereby reducing the timeliness of ISAC systems. Additionally, these solutions assume perfect alignment between communication users and sensing targets, which may not be a realistic assumption in real-world doubly-dynamic scenarios. Although obtaining perfect channel-related parameters in double dynamics is challenging, other observable environmental information correlates with channel information, as demonstrated in synesthesia of machine (SoM) [20]. For instance, [21] integrated multi-modal sensing information to boost beamforming for communications. Inspired by this concept, data from diverse modalities has the potential in enhancing the performance of real-time ISAC precoding. However, research from this perspective is still in its early stages, and specific SoM operational modes for ISAC remain undefined.\nReinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention in communication systems design thanks to its adaptability to dynamics without prior assumptions. Existing research has employed RL for precoding design [22, 23]. For instance, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) was utilized for the hybrid precoding transceivers design in [22]. However, these studies primarily focus on enhancing communications and overlook sensing tasks. Regarding sensing applications, [24] employed SARSA algorithm to jointly optimize precoders and array segmentation for balancing communications and sensing. [25] focused on flexible alternation between communication and sensing modes. Despite these efforts, the level of integration remains limited. Furthermore, applying RL to the considered problem encounters three main challenges: the high-dimensional and structurally complex action space, the significant difficulties in feature extraction and action selection due to diverse environmental state observations, and the challenges in updating policies due to the varying number of users.\nTo overcome the aforementioned barriers, we devise an efficient deep-RL (DRL)-aided framework to facilitate real-time wideband ISAC precoding design, in the absence of instantaneous CSI or target angle information. Inspired by SoM, this framework leverages various observations from the base station (BS), such as historical position estimates and initial CSI, as adaptable inputs to accommodate the double dynamics. We begin by formulating a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) for this scenario, defining the observed state space and reward function. To navigate the intricate decision space in hybrid precoding, we customize a hybrid action space for efficient precoding updates. Furthermore, we employ a parameter-shared actor-critic (PSAC) architecture to extract features from the state, reducing network parameters and speeding up training. To optimize model training, we tailor the updating procedure for both the actor and critic components. Our proposed algorithm incorporates two carefully crafted precoding update schemes: update across the user dimension and update across the antenna dimension. It is noteworthy that the proposed scheme also exemplifies SoM-Enhance in [20], wherein channel information for both communication and sensing is enriched through observations from various modalities. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving both communications and sensing performance in a doubly dynamic environment.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We present an alternating optimization-based algorithm for ISAC hybrid precoding with complete environmental state information, designed to adapt to ICI caused by Doppler shift in wideband multi-user systems.\n\u2022 To tackle the doubly-dynamic ISAC precoding challenge, we introduce a DRL-aided algorithm. We carefully craft the network architecture and training process to address the complex decision space issue. The dynamic update schemes proposed are compatible with existing hybrid precoding architectures.\n\u2022 Through extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing benchmarks, pushing the performance boundaries for ISAC in doubly-dynamic scenarios. This is achieved with reduced computational complexity and improved timeliness.\nThe remainder of this work is structured as follows. Section II introduces the system model. The proposed optimization-based wideband ISAC precoding design is illustrated in Section III as preliminary. Section IV includes the ISAC frame structure designed for doubly-dynamic scenarios, and the detailed DRL-aided algorithms for doubly-dynamic ISAC precoding is introduced in Section V.

However, it is far away from optimal in practical double dynamics, due to the following reasons:\n\u2022 Huge complexity: The iteration in the solution introduces significant computational complexity, scaling up to $O(M(N^{3.5}\\log(1/\\epsilon)+2N_{\\text{iter}}U^2N_t))$ given a solution accuracy $\\epsilon$ and $N_{\\text{iter}}$ alternating iterations. This results in an unacceptable delay, especially with large antenna arrays in studied scenarios.\n\u2022 Heavy reliance on perfect prior: The doubly-dynamic scenarios impose significant challenges on instantaneous channel estimation and targets\u2019 position acquisition, rendering the optimization-based method, which heavily rely on perfect state information, no longer effective.\n\u2022 Mediocre performance: The obtained solutions may incur potentially significant suboptimality for two main reasons. Firstly, the relaxation of the rank-1 constraint can lead to being stuck in local optimality when optimizing $\\mathbf{F}_m$. Secondly, the decomposition of $\\mathbf{F}_m$ introduces additional loss in overall performance.\nTherefore, it is crucial to solve this sequential optimization problem with low complexity and reduced reliance on perfect instantaneous state information."}, {}]}

{"title": "A Generative AI-driven Metadata Modelling Approach", "authors": ["Mayukh Bagchi"], "abstract": "Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative libraries handling cancer information.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Since the 1980s (Yu and Breivold 2008) and increasingly from the 2000s (Tedd and Large 2004), the development and continual management of (digitised) metadata (Satija, Bagchi and Mart\u00ednez-\u00c1vila 2020) has been core to the mundane functioning of any well-administered academic library. With the advent and increasing pervasiveness of Al (Cox, Pinfield and Rutter 2019) and Generative AI (Banh and Strobel 2023), however, the scope of an academic library has radically expanded to include the deployment of AI-based data-driven information services, e.g., research data management (Andrikopoulou, Rowley and Walton 2022), ontology-driven content management (Bagchi 2021a; Bagchi 2021b), chatbots (Bagchi 2020), all of which crucially depend on a well-founded metadata model (semantically) annotating and exposing the underlying data. For instance, let us consider the motivating scenario of semantically annotating scientific information in cancer research (e.g., cancer big data (Jiang et al. 2022)) within the framework of an academic library. Such an exercise is clearly dependent on a multitude of factors, e.g., the precise purpose, the target user base, the technical features, etc., each of which mutually defines the information service(s) that will harness such information. To that end, for example, a metadata model designed by a metadata librarian (Han and Hswe 2011) annotating, e.g., cancer big data, for a specialised cancer research library will be significantly (if not completely) different from one suited for an oncology policy library which, again, would be considerably different from a metadata model employed by a medical college library.\nThe general thesis advanced by this paper, as evidenced from the aforementioned motivating scenario and several other similar use-cases (see, for e.g., (Van Dijck 2014; Gartner 2016; Ulrich et al. 2022)), is that there is no unique metadata model which is necessary and sufficient for semantic data annotation within a single domain and certainly (not) for the heterogeneity inherent in cross-domain use-case scenarios (see also (EU-NSF 2024)). Let us understand, via the lens of the motivating scenario, the interlinked representation levels which cumulatively constitute a metadata model as indicated in the above thesis. First, the perception of the (expert) users of a cancer research library towards cancer research data would be highly specialised (e.g., uncovering multi-omics workflows (Ulrich et al. 2022)) and hence considerably different to how it is perceived by the (expert) users of an oncology policy library or a medical college library. Second, as a partial consequence of the first reason, the terminology employed by the users of the three types of libraries to describe the various perceived concepts of cancer research data would be mutually different. Third, the decision to ontologically characterise a perceived data concept as, e.g., a function or a process (Arp and Smith 2008) or an object property or a data property (Bagchi 2022) etc., by users of the three different types of libraries would be mutually different. Fourth, as a direct consequence of the ontological characterization, the taxonomy (Bagchi and Madalli 2019) assumed by the users of the three types of libraries would be markedly different. Fifth, the intensional characterization (see, e.g., (Von Fintel and Heim 2011), for an overview of intensional semantics) of the taxonomy in terms of interrelating and describing its constituent concepts via object properties and data properties would be different for different sets of (expert) library users. Finally, it is also key to note that the ordered representation levels, as briefed above, (each) independently as well as cumulatively compounds the design of any metadata model (e.g., developed by one of the three aforementioned libraries) and complicates its crosswalk with any other metadata model (e.g., developed by the other two).\nNotice that the above contextualization of the motivating scenario into a general thesis about modelling metadata is not by chance. It is, in fact, a direct instantiation of the problem of Conceptual Entanglement (Bagchi and Das 2022; Bagchi and Das 2023) ubiquitous in knowledge organization and representation research, whereby, it posits that any conceptual knowledge model (e.g., a metadata model) is representationally manifold by design and cannot be necessary and sufficient for all use-cases irrespective of their intra-domain or inter-domain setting. Let us understand the above in terms of the motivating scenario. First, there is always a many-to-many correspondence (hereafter, referred to as representational manifoldness) between entities and how they are perceived as concepts (e.g., by sets of users of the three different libraries). Second, given perception, there is always a representational manifoldness between the perceived concepts and how they are linguistically labelled (e.g., by the same sets of users) using some terminology. Third, given labelling, there is always a representational manifoldness between the labelled concepts and their ontological status (e.g., by the same sets of users). Fourth, as a consequence of the manifoldness in ontological characterisation, there is always a representational manifoldness between the ontologically characterised concepts and how they ought to be taxonomically classified (e.g., as per the warrant of the same set of users). Fifth, there is always a representational manifoldness between the taxonomically classified concepts and how they are intensionally interrelated and described via properties. Two observations. Firstly, it is interesting to note how the individual as well as the cumulative impact of the representation layers magnify the entanglement in the final metadata model. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, notice the need to explicate the decision of the modeller (e.g., a metadata librarian) at each level which, in an overwhelming majority of cases, remains implicit (Bagchi and Das 2022; Bagchi and Das 2023).\nThe solution proposed in this paper is a Generative AI-driven LLM-based enhancement of an early version of the approach termed as Conceptual Disentanglement (Bagchi and Das 2022; Bagchi and Das 2023). The key focus of the approach is to explicitly disentangle the decisions made by the modeller (e.g., a metadata librarian), at each (knowledge) representation level mentioned before, which would otherwise implicitly entangle the final conceptual knowledge artefact (e.g., the metadata model). To that end, the general strategy of the approach is to explicitly enforce one-to-one correspondence (hereafter, referred to as representational bijection) out of the potentially many representational manifold possibilities at each level. To explain using the motivating scenario, first, the metadata librarian (who is the modeller) should explicate a representational bijection between entities and their consensual perception as concepts (e.g., by a particular set of users of one of the libraries). Second, given the fixation of perception, the metadata librarian should explicate a representational bijection between the perceived concepts and their linguistic labelling via a consensual body of terminology. Third, given the fixation of terminology, the metadata librarian should explicate a representational bijection between the labelled concepts and their ontological commitments (Guarino, Carrara and Giaretta 1994), i.e., whether they are events or processes or properties, etc. In fact, an ontology-driven metadata model is key to underpin the precise semantics represented within (meta)data concepts and properties (see, for e.g., the arguments advanced in (Dutta 2014; Leipzig et al. 2021)). Fourth, the metadata librarian should explicate a representational bijection between the ontologically characterised concepts and their exact taxonomy. Fifth, given the taxonomy, the metadata librarian should explicate a representational bijection between each concept in the taxonomy and their exact intensional characterization. Finally, it is interesting to note how the individual as well as the cumulative disentanglement of the representation layers minimise the entanglement in the final metadata model. Notice that the decision of the modeller is also explicit at each representation level thereby crucially impacting the minimization of the conceptual entanglement.\nWhile the contextualization, problem and solution approach is clear to some extent, it is not yet clear as to how the solution approach can be potentially implemented by, e.g., a metadata librarian, within an academic library setting. In fact, there are two critical complementary highlights which should characterise any implementation strategy of the conceptual disentanglement approach for modelling library metadata. First, while the approach attempts to disentangle, level-by-level, the entanglement inherent by design in a metadata model, it runs the risk of considerable intellectual work on part of the metadata librarian in terms of manually factoring and refactoring constituent knowledge management nitty-gritties (Bagchi 2019a; Bagchi 2019b). On the other hand, given the justified complexity of the conceptual disentanglement approach (e.g., in layers like perception or ontology), an overtly (semi-)automatic implementation is not poised to produce an ontology-driven metadata model of requisite quality. To harness the best of both worlds (i.e., human and machine), the paper proposes a novel implementation of the conceptual disentanglement approach via Generative Al-driven Human-LLM Collaboration, wherein, the metadata librarian, using prompt engineering (Ekin 2023), exploits an LLM (Liang et al. 2022; Chang et al. 2024) to generate a conceptually (dis)entangled metadata model which, for each representational level, is validated/repaired/enriched by him/her. Notice that the validation or repair or enrichment of the Human-LLM collaboratively generated metadata model by the metadata librarian can involve several standard dimensions, e.g., metadata quality (Park 2009), semantic quality (Poels et al. 2005), and additionally purpose-specific dimensions such as, e.g., measuring the fit of the metadata model with actual cancer data/information. Overall, a widespread acceptance and implementation of the conceptual disentanglement approach via Generative AI-driven Human-LLM collaboration is poised to bring to the fore several advantages in terms of, e.g., metadata development methodologies, metadata crosswalk and interoperability (Khoo and Hall 2010), semantic heterogeneity (Hull 1997), FAIR data (Wilkinson et al. 2016), etc.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows: The second section describes the different knowledge representation levels involved in designing a metadata model and how such levels are ordered and interlinked to cumulatively impact its design. The third section details the problem of conceptual entanglement individually and cumulatively across the representation levels and their confounding impact on the design of the metadata model. The Generative Al-driven Human-LLM collaboration based conceptual disentanglement approach individually and cumulatively across the representation levels and the way it minimises the entanglement and confusion in the design of the metadata model is elucidated in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section discusses research implications from the related work in terms of some of the (generative) AI, metadata and semantics-based research issues academic libraries face and the sixth section concludes the paper. Throughout all the sections, especially for the second, third and fourth sections, an adapted instantiation of the motivating scenario in terms of a simplified ontology-driven metadata model for the cancer domain would be employed to exemplify and highlight the issues and approaches. Further, several of the fine-grained technical intricacies, e.g., of knowledge representation, are skipped in accordance with the broader methodological scope of the paper."}, {"title": "Representation Levels in Modelling Metadata", "content": "Let us now expand the discussion on the characteristically independent but functionally interlinked knowledge organization and representation levels which cumulatively compose any metadata model within the framework of an academic library. To that end, we have the following:\n1. Perceptual Level, wherein, the correspondence between entities and their perception as concepts are modelled;\n2. Terminological Level, wherein, the correspondence between perceived concepts and the terms which linguistically represent them are modelled;\n3. Ontological Level, wherein, the correspondence between labelled concepts and their ontological commitment is modelled;\n4. Taxonomical Level, wherein, the correspondence between ontologically enriched concepts and their classification into a taxonomic hierarchy is modelled;\n5. Intensional Level, wherein, the correspondence between the taxonomic concepts and how they are intensionally interrelated and described is modelled.\nAdditionally, it is also important to note that the motivating example considered for illustrating the above (and for remainder of the paper) are three equally probable variations of an ontology-driven library metadata model for cancer domain (e.g., encoding concepts such as Clinical Trial, Patient, Biomarker, Imaging Test, Histopathology Report, etc.) generated by prompting the Generative-AI based LLM (interface) - ChatGPT 3.5 - using a series of prompts. Please note two observations (valid throughout the paper). The metadata models cannot be reproduced completely within the full-text of this paper due to constraints of space and to that end, please follow the link - motivating example - wherein readers can get a fuller understanding of the concept/property exemplified in the paper and its page location within the linked document describing the generated metadata models. Also, while the metadata model generated by ChatGPT 3.5 is informal in nature, this is not relevant to the scope of this paper as it can be directly formalised in any formal language of choice (e.g., the web ontology language - OWL) for concrete implementation purposes. The above levels are elucidated as follows.\nFirst, let us concentrate on the perceptual level which, while being not explicitly pronounced in state-of-the-art library metadata research and implementation (see, e.g., (Haynes 2018; Strecker et al. 2021)), is nonetheless the very first level where the crucial representational choice as to how a set of entities should be perceived as concepts (later) composing a library metadata model is made. Notice two key dimensions which inform the decision-making of a metadata librarian at this level. First, it goes without mentioning that perception is highly egocentric to an individual academic library user and therefore is usually incomplete (Bagchi 2021a) and cannot be fully captured in a (semi-)formal manner. Second, while the first dimension holds, it is also equally the case that various communities of practice (Wenger 1999; Cox 2005) (e.g., users of different types of libraries) commit to a shared and homogeneous perception as to how certain entities should be perceived as concepts. Consider the case of the motivating example. In it, pages 1-7 elaborates a general (ontology-driven) library metadata model for cancer domain generated by ChatGPT 3.5 with constituent concepts (classes and properties) at three levels of abstraction. Further, note how the general model, via successive prompts, is tuned to the potential perceptions of a representative library user belonging to the specialised cancer research community (pages 8-10), oncology policy community (pages 10-12) and medical college student community (pages 12-14), respectively. It is interesting to observe that even for the same macro domain (i.e., cancer), each of the three metadata models encode concepts and properties uniquely relevant to the perception of a specific user community.\nSecond, given the understanding as to why perception is crucial for modelling metadata, let us now turn to the terminological level where the key representational choice is to decide how a set of perceived concepts should be labelled using a body of terminology. This choice is not trivial for the metadata librarian due to the very nature of the interaction of language with the perceptual level. Languages are \u201citemized [terminological] inventories\u201d (Brown and Lenneberg 1954) of the entities we perceive and each of such \u201cinventories\u201d generate either similar (but not the same) or a different lexicalization of the perception due to issues following from linguistic relativity (Boroditsky 2011). Such a lexicalization might manifest amongst different sets of academic library users in terms of different linguistic phenomenon. For example, two well known linguistic phenomenon include polysemy (the coexistence of several potential meanings of a term) and synonymy (terms having similar meanings) (Glynn and Robinson 2014). Lexical gaps (Bentivogli and Pianta 2000) occur when, for a concept, a specific language/vocabulary doesn't have a referrent term. The scenario might get even more confounded when library user communities communicate with each other or with the computer system by linguistically referring to the perceived entities with terms from specialised terminological standards (Suonuuti 1997) or glossaries (Sarginson et al. 2012) possibly from different languages. There might be issues with both mapping and interoperability of terms amongst the standards due to issues of linguistic phenomenon or non-existent terminological crosswalks. To exemplify, in the motivating example, please refer to page 20-23 which detail the LLM response to the prompt clarifying the terminology employed in the three examples. Notice that parts of the cancer research library metadata model uses terms from the Dublin Core (Weibel et al. 1998) to express its perceived concepts. Similarly, the oncology policy library and the medical college library metadata models use terms from standards such as HL7 (Health Level Seven) standard, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) standard, SNOMED-CT, etc. (Schulz, Stegwee and Chronaki 2019).\nThird, given the central importance of terminology in the design of any library metadata model, the next dimension to understand is the ontological level where the key representational choice regarding the ontological commitment (Guarino, Carrara and Giaretta 1994) of the (newly) labelled concepts is made. This choice, again, is non-trivial for the metadata librarian due to the theoretical root of the interaction of ontology with the terminological level, in the sense that, committing to a terminology results in committing to an ontology (Moltmann 2019) which might not be necessarily completely compatible with another ontology/terminology pairing. The chief importance of this representation level is to explicate the otherwise implicit commitment of the body of terms to a top-level ontology (Guarino 1997), wherein, such an ontology, based on an explicitly specified philosophical doctrine, reveals the underlying nature of domain-level concepts. There can be several such philosophical doctrines such as three-dimensionalism, four-dimensionalism, etc. (McCall and Lowe 2006), and according to the chosen doctrine, the domain-level labelled concepts can be classified as a kind, a part-of, an event, a process, a role, a function or a property (Gangemi et al. 2001). Two observations. First, by far, this representation layer is the most demanding in terms of the involvement of the human modeller, i.e., the metadata librarian, for the simple reason that while different library user communities might, most possibly, conceptualise the same set of entities into different top-level ontological categories, it is chiefly the responsibility of the metadata librarian to explicate such assumptions. Secondly, as evidenced in decades worth of research in semantic heterogeneity (Hull 1997), the ontological level is key to achieve a range of semantics-intensive tasks like semantic mapping (Beneventano et al. 2008) and semantic interoperability (Bittner, Donnelly and Winter 2005) with respect to (meta)data models. To exemplify, in the motivating example, please refer to page 23-29 which detail the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the ontological categories employed in the three examples. For example, notice that in page 26, the LLM response aligns concepts and properties such as Document and hasAuthor to top-level ontological categories like Information Object and Quality.\nFourth, given the importance of ontological commitment of constituent concepts and properties in a library metadata model, let us concentrate on the taxonomical level where the key representational choice regarding the ontologically characterised concepts and their classification into a taxonomical hierarchy is made. This choice by the metadata librarian is guided by two key factors. First, the ontological level already induces a very abstract high-level taxonomy for the concepts due to the mandatory ontological constraints (Guarino, Carrara and Giaretta 1994) they pose while the metadata librarian commits to a specific top-level ontology and its constituent top-level ontological categories. For example, if the concept Person and Patient belong to the top-level ontological categories Kind and Role, it is an ontological constraint that Role can never be the taxonomical parent of a Kind, and, therefore, Patient can never be the taxonomical parent of Person. Within the ontological constraints, however, the taxonomy can be designed by the metadata librarian in accordance with how its hierarchy and metadata properties will be exploited by the target information service (e.g., a data catalog (Guptill 1999), a chatbot (Bagchi 2020)). To exemplify, in the motivating example, please refer to page 30-34 which detail the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the taxonomical choices made (for concepts as well as properties). For example, in page 30, Library Resource is specialised into Research Paper and Dataset. Notice that, alongside the ontological level, the taxonomical level is also equally demanding, if not more, in terms of the involvement of the metadata librarian in modelling the classification hierarchy.\nLast but not the least, given the key importance of the taxonomic classification in the composition of a library metadata model, let us focus on the intensional level where the key representational choice is how to interrelate and describe each individual concept in the taxonomy. This is done by first finalising the specialisation of the already classified properties (in the ontological level) into object properties and data properties (Bagchi and Madalli 2019). Note that, even if the properties are informally classified as object or data property by the metadata librarian before this level, the final decision is taken at this level. Second, each concept in the taxonomy is assigned with a set of object properties which encode how the concept is interlinked with other concepts in the overall metadata model. Equally, and perhaps the most important aspect, every taxonomic concept is assigned with a set of data properties which describe its attributes. Two observations. First, this level, implementationally, is perhaps the most visible and pronounced level in a library metadata model as it decides on the data properties which ultimately encode real-world library metadata. Secondly, this level is central to a library metadata model in the sense that it decides the inheritance of data properties by classes (aka concepts) in the taxonomy, thereby, considerably influencing the decision concerning the description of each taxonomic concept by a set of data properties and data types. To exemplify, in the motivating example, please refer to page 34-39 which detail the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the object and data property choices made. For example, in page 35, the concept Policy Document is described with data properties like {policyDocumentID, policyDocumentTitle, policyDocumentText}.\nFinally, it is interesting to note two crucial highlights about the aforementioned levels of knowledge organization and representation which constitute any library (or, even a generic) metadata model. First, the ordering from perception to intensionality is not just a linear, ordered sequence but is essentially an ordered and continual interlinked scientific spiral (Ranganathan 1957) from perception to intensionality and back. To that end, successive cycles can be utilised by the metadata librarian to continuously validate/repair/update/enrich the library metadata model with new potential changes in any of the representation levels. This also reinforces the notion of the non-validity of a single or a few metadata models as necessary and sufficient for any and every domain and application scenario. Second, notice that the above levels of representation is a general framework to understand the composition of a library metadata model. It might well be the case that for a specific application scenario, the perceptual level or the terminological level or both are quite homogeneous and, therefore, of much less relative importance to the model than that of, e.g., the ontological level or the intensional level. In any case, such permutations and combinations of the relative importance of each representation level to the final library metadata model should be decided on a case-by-case basis."}, {"title": "Entanglement in Modelling Metadata", "content": "Given the central and irreplaceable impact of the five functionally interlinked representation levels on the modelling of metadata, let us now focus on how the conceptual entanglement problem is implicitly instantiated at each successive level within the metadata design strategy of an academic library. To that end, we have the following:\n1. Perceptual Entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness between entities and their perception as concepts;\n2. Terminological Entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness between perceived concepts and the terms which are employed to label them;\n3. Ontological Entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness between labelled concepts and their ontological commitment;\n4. Taxonomical Entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness between ontologically enriched concepts and their taxonomic classification;\n5. Intensional Entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness between the taxonomic concepts and their intensionality.\nIn order to exemplify the stratification above, the same motivating example of the ontology-driven library metadata model for cancer domain is employed (pages 8-43). Notice also the fact that the stratification of conceptual entanglement proposed above is in sync with the stratification of representation in metadata proposed in the second section. The above levels are elucidated as follows.\nFirst, let us concentrate on perceptual entanglement which, in essence, refers to the many-to-many mapping between entities and their perception as concepts which would eventually compose a library metadata model. There are two key factors which underlie the entanglement in the decision-making of a metadata librarian at this level. First, as already briefed before, perception is egocentric and can be unique to communities of practice. This premise leads to the notion of perception as a cognitive filter (Guarino, Guizzardi and Mylopoulos 2020), i.e., in our terms, the fact that the same entity and its properties can be perceived differently by different groups of library users depending on their overall purpose and goals. There can be an overlap in the concepts perceived between, say, two groups of library users and, equally, there can be ranges of mutual exclusion in their perception (e.g., due to different purposes or goals). Second, the highly implicit nature and consideration of perception within academic library metadata design (see, e.g., (Fleming, Mering and Wolfe 2008; Lopatin 2010)) almost leads to the necessary and sufficient assumption (explained before) on surface while the underlying multiplicities of perception remain unaddressed. Consider the case of the motivating example generated by ChatGPT 3.5 via Human-LLM collaboration. Three different user perceptions, viz., of a representative cancer research library (pages 8-10), an oncology policy library (pages 10-12) and a medical college library (pages 12-14), of the same macro domain cancer are illustrated in the example. Notice that the commonality in the perception of the three different communities are indicated by their shared perceived concept of cancer specialised by its various types (breast cancer, lung cancer, etc.) and described by common properties (e.g., biomarkers associated with a cancer). However, major differences emerge in the three perceptions due to their very purpose in studying the same entity cancer. The cancer research library user community is interested in concepts like research study, treatment and properties like clinical trial ID, pathology report text, etc. The oncology policy library user community, on the other hand, is interested in policy documents like clinical guidelines, best practice, regulatory policy, etc. The medical college library user community is interested in medical study, study material, treatment approach, etc. Please see pages 15-18 in the motivating example for more details on differences in perception. It is interesting to notice from above the representational manifoldness between the same (domain) entities and how they are variously perceived as concepts.\nSecond, let us focus on the terminological entanglement which implies the necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between perceived concepts and their lexicalization using a terminological label. As briefly mentioned earlier, linguistic phenomena are a key inducer of representational manifoldness at this level. For example, polysemous terms labelling a perceived concept provides at best an ambiguous notion of its meaning and magnifies the many-to-many possibilities for the metadata librarian. On the other hand, the central problem with synonyms is the establishment of mapping. Given implicitly synonymous terms, it might not always be straightforward for the metadata librarian to infer whether they are same or synonymous or a broader/narrower/distinct term. The above problems are further compounded in settings which might involve multiple languages and/or multiple communities of different genres of academic library users. To exemplify, in the motivating example, let us consider the singular case of the concept Breast Cancer (page 8). It can be termed variously by different communities of library users as Carcinoma of the Breast, Mammary Carcinoma, Breast Tissue Malignant Neoplasm or Lobular Adenocarcinoma. In multilingual metadata modelling settings, the same concept can be referred to as, for instance, cancer du sein in French, c\u00e1ncer de mama in Catalan or rakovina prsu in Czech. While technologies from Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be harnessed to implement some of these semantic (non)equivalences, it is crucial for the metadata librarian to first diagnose and understand the entanglement and manifoldness existent in the equivalency mapping.\nThird, given the elucidation of terminological entanglement, let us now elaborate the notion of ontological entanglement which refers to the necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between labelled concepts and their ontological commitment. There are two interlinked dimensions underlying the above entanglement. First, due to perceptual and subsequent terminological entanglement, different communities of library users can perceive and label the same entity differently, thereby, bootstrapping the many-to-many mapping between different entities/concepts and the different top-level ontological categories they might potentially be categorised into. Second, as a consequence of the first reason, different communities of library users, unknowingly and implicitly, commit to the philosophical doctrine of the one of the state-of-the-art top-level ontologies such as DOLCE (Gangemi et al. 2002), BFO (Smith, Kumar and Bittner 2005), UFO (Guizzardi et al. 2022), etc., thereby, adding a second layer of many-to-many entanglement between entities and top-level ontological theories. The ontological entanglement resulting in a multiplicity of representational manifoldness between labelled concepts and their top-level ontological characterization, in effect, translates into application-level implementational entanglements such as the management of interoperability and harvesting of metadata in networked academic library settings (Taha 2012). To exemplify, in the motivating example, let us consider the ontological entanglement in the oncology policy library metadata model as detailed in page 27. Notice that the same concept of a Policy Document has been categorised into different ontological categories (Information Object, Artefact, Continuant) by different top-level ontologies (DOLCE, UFO, BFO), respectively. Further, each of these categories can be instantiated for various other labelled concepts, e.g., textbook on page 28 (having a different semantics).\nFourth, with the assumption of ontological entanglement and ontological constraints, let us now elucidate the taxonomical entanglement sub-problem which refers to the necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between ontologically enriched concepts and their taxonomic classification which would eventually constitute the backbone of a library metadata model. There are four key parameters, from Ranganathan's faceted classification theory (Ranganathan 1967; Ranganathan 1989), which induce representational manifoldness at this stage. First, with respect to a concept at a specific level of abstraction in the taxonomy, there are always multiple characteristics which can be employed to taxonomically specialise that concept into (potentially many) subordinate concepts. Second, the successive application of characteristics across the entire depth of taxonomy (with the possibility of multiple classificatory characteristics at each level of abstraction) leads to potentially infinite entangled classifications. Third and fourth, there can also be multiple ways in which concepts can be organised horizontally across a specific level of taxonomic abstraction (termed arrays in (Ranganathan 1967)) and vertically across a taxonomic path (termed chains in (Ranganathan 1967)), respectively. To exemplify the above, in the motivating example, please refer to page 30-34 which detail the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the taxonomical choices made. Although simplistic, note that the Human-LLM prompt collaboration returns two equally probable but different entangled taxonomies (page 31: example 1 and example 2) for the oncology policy library user community. It is interesting to observe that in example 1, the taxonomy is implicitly suited for a library metadata model on social-healthcare policy perspective whereas in example 2, the taxonomy is implicitly suited for a library metadata model on governmental-healthcare policy perspective.\nLast but not the least, with the assumption of taxonomical entanglement, let us now elucidate the problem of intensional entanglement which refers to the necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between the taxonomic concepts and their intensional interrelation and description. There are two key factors which magnify representational manifoldness in this final stage. First, during the final decision to characterise a property (uncovered at the ontological level) as an object or a data property, there exists a many-to-many mapping as the same property can be represented and refactored as an object or a data property depending on the purposes and goals to be served by the library metadata model. Second, a concept in the taxonomy can be interrelated and described via multiple possible combinations of sets of object and data properties, again, depending on the precise purpose of the final metadata model. To exemplify the entanglement, in the motivating example, please refer to page 34-39 which detail the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the object and data property choices made. For example, the Human-LLM collaboration example generated two equally probable but different sets of object and data properties (page 36) implicitly suited for the medical students and medical study participants user community of a medical college library, respectively.\nFinally, notice that the aforementioned individual level-by-level representational manifoldness are accumulative in nature and, therefore, there is also an overall manifoldness between entities and their taxonomy and intensional characterization. In the motivating example, pages 39-43 detail at length the LLM response to the prompt requesting for the overall many-to-many mapping between entities, taxonomical hierarchies and intensional property-based characterization. For example, even within the same macro domain of discourse cancer, different perception by the three different communities of library users (cancer specialists, oncology policy experts and medical college professionals) generate multiple terminology, ontological categories, taxonomies and property predication, most of which are not in correspondence amongst each other. Further, as also previously noted in the second section, it might well be the case that for an application scenario, there might be no manifoldness in perception or in terminology or both (with, e.g., the other entanglements still holding). In any case, the conceptual entanglement problem is a generic characterization inherent and implicit by design in any library metadata model and should be adapted as necessary on a case-by-case basis."}, {"title": "Towards Generative AI-driven Disentangled Metadata Modelling", "content": "After the elucidation of how the conceptual entanglement problem is inherent", "following": "n1.

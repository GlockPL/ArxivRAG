Introduction", "content": "With rapid urbanization, an estimated 40% of the population spends at least one hour commuting daily, making urban mobility management critical for smart, sustainable cities (Schafer and Victor, 2000). Increasing urban populations and automobile numbers have pushed transportation systems to their limits, leading to congestion, accidents, energy waste, and pollution (Sperling and Gordon, 2009). To address these challenges, cities are leveraging advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and computing technologies to transform urban transportation into more efficient, safe, and sustainable systems (Sodhro et al., 2020). These technological innovations are at the core of developing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which utilize vast amounts of mobility data from traffic sensors, connected vehicles (CVs), simulations, and crowdsourcing to enable real-time situational awareness and predictive analytics of urban traffic dynamics (Li et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2023b). These systems optimize infrastructure design, traffic controls, and vehicle operations while providing intelligent advisory services and decision support for travelers and operators(De Souza et al., 2016; Mandhare et al., 2018). Cities worldwide are adopting advanced ITS to create connected transportation environments that maximize safety, mobility, and environmental performance, as seen in initiatives like Japan's VICS and Smartway, Europe's CVIS and COOPERS, and the U.S.'s ITS Strategic Plan (An et al., 2011).\nDespite the successes of ITS globally, challenges remain in developing scalable, accessible, and interoperable smart mobility solutions (Javed et al., 2022). These challenges hinder the full potential of ITS and CV technologies, especially for diverse urban residents, including commuters, drivers, planners, and policymakers. Smart city technologies must scale to accommodate growing populations and complex systems (Bondi, 2000). Modernizing urban transportation requires extensive data processing and analysis, alongside labor-intensive efforts to develop traffic simulations and ITS software components (Torre-Bastida et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2023b). Additionally, the inaccessibility of smart mobility services and transportation data limits effective utilization by city residents (Cledou et al., 2018). There's a need for a digital assistant capable of helping users discover and access ITS tools and information intuitively. As smart city planning shifts towards human-centric approaches, next-generation ITS and CVs should promote public participation through user-friendly, intuitive technologies that do not require specialized skills (Alsayed, 2024; Vasilieva et al., 2023). These technologies should enable residents to customize smart mobility services through non-technical interactions.\nBuilding on Al's history in transportation research, there's a growing trend to leverage generative AI (GenAI) technologies to overcome limitations in existing ITS through advanced language understanding, content generation, and reasoning. This paper explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies to transform ITS and CVs into intelligent multi-agent systems, advancing smart mobility services to be more autonomous, engaging, and human-centric. We review current mobility data and technologies in ITS and CV sectors, and propose a conceptual framework for integrating GenAI with ongoing ITS and CV applications in terms of the following aspects: (a) Promoting science-based advisory for reducing congestion,"}, {"title": "2.

Emerging Mobility Data", "content": "Mobility data encompasses a wide array of types derived from various technological sources, including IoT-connected transportation infrastructure, connected vehicles, and social media platforms (Zhang et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2022). Each of these technologies offers unique insights into different aspects of urban mobility, forming the backbone of advanced data-driven and simulation-driven approaches to sustainable urban transportation planning and mobility management (Li et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "2.1.1. Road-side Infrastructure", "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed transportation infrastructure by enabling the collection and analysis of vast mobility data, crucial for enhancing traffic management, road safety, public transportation, and reducing environmental impacts (Guerrero-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2018). IoT integration in roadside infrastructure generates diverse mobility data, each captured by specialized sensors designed to monitor various aspects of vehicular and environmental dynamics (Klein, 2024).\nTraffic flow data includes vehicle volume, speed, and traffic density across road networks. It is crucial for managing congestion, planning road expansions, predicting traffic patterns, and detecting traffic incidents (Leduc et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2021a; Moriano et al., 2024). This data is typically obtained by inductive loop sensors, radar systems, or CCTV cameras with advanced analytics (Klein, 2024; Zheng et al., 2022; Berres et al., 2024). Parking data informs drivers about available parking spaces and optimizes the use of parking facilities (Lin et al., 2017c). It is usually collected through ultrasonic sensors, magnetometers, or cameras that monitor occupancy in real time (Shao et al., 2022; Kianpisheh et al., 2012; Dixit et al., 2020). Environmental data includes air quality, temperature, and humidity metrics, essential for assessing transportation systems' environmental impact and adapting to weather conditions (Asam et al., 2015; Guerrero-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2018). This data is gathered by air quality monitors, weather stations, and road surface sensors across transportation networks (Mead et al., 2013). Public transit data offers real-time insights into bus, train, and other transit operations (Welch and Widita, 2019). It includes vehicle location, passenger numbers, and schedule adherence, enabling transit agencies to optimize services and provide accurate passenger information (Koutsopoulos et al., 2019).\nAdvancements in cloud computing, digital twins, and cyberinfrastructure have made diverse mobility data more accessible via various wireless communication protocols (Xu et al., 2022a). Web service endpoints, along with well-documented metadata, offer new opportunities for AI technologies. These technologies, through machine-to-machine communication, enable automatedv decision-making, data analytics, information sharing, and enhanced visualization capabilities (Xu et al., 2023b, 2024b; Berres et al., 2021a,b). Since positioning and movement data for many private vehicles and public transit systems are captured through vehicular sensors and onboard units rather than roadside infrastructure, these aspects will be discussed in the next subsection."}, {"title": "2.1.2.

This development creates opportunities for AI agents to leverage these methods as web or cloud services, enabling automated analytics and optimizations when they are tasked to provide smart mobility services to urban residents."}, {"title": "2.2.1. Traffic State Forecasting and Vehicle Behavior Prediction", "content": "Traffic state forecasting and behavior prediction are crucial for developing strategies that enhance road safety, reduce congestion, and improve traffic efficiency. Traffic state forecasting predicts future conditions like flow, density, and speed by leveraging historical and real-time data from sources such as loop detectors, cameras, probing devices, and social media (Kumar and Raubal, 2021). Vehicle behavior prediction focuses on forecasting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles using data from historical trajectories and traffic environments gathered through sensors and communication networks.\nAlgorithms for traffic state forecasting and vehicle behavior prediction can be broadly categorized into model-based and learning-based methods. Traditional model-based methods include statistical time series models (Antoniou et al.,"}, {"title": "2.2.2. Driving Advisory and Intelligent Speed Adaptation", "content": "Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) are sophisticated technologies designed to enhance driver decision-making and road safety by providing real-time guidance (Ameta et al., 2023). Utilizing data from GPS, traffic monitoring systems, and vehicle sensors, ADAS offers advice on lane usage, merging, speed adjustments, and route selection, reducing driver workload and improving safety (Antony and Whenish, 2021).\nIntelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) helps drivers maintain appropriate speeds by either advising them of speed limits or automatically adjusting the vehicle's speed to comply with legal limits, enhancing safety and fuel efficiency (Ryan, 2019; Newsome and WSP, 2024). ISA systems use GPS, digital maps, and onboard cameras to determine speed limits, functioning either as advisory systems or as automatic speed controllers (Archer and \u00c5berg, 2001; Carsten, 2006). The goal of ISA is to reduce speed-related traffic accidents and improve road safety.\nBuilding on vehicle communication technologies, ADAS and ISA have been widely adopted to optimize Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) (Nidamanuri et al., 2021). CAV control varies by levels of cooperation and automation. In connected but non-automated scenarios, advisory systems compute energy-saving or congestion-mitigating trajectories for human drivers (Wan et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2024c; Suramardhana and Jeong, 2014). In automated but non-connected scenarios, ADAS ensures smooth vehicle operations using onboard sensors (Zhou et al., 2022e,c,d, 2023c). Fully connected and automated systems exhibit four classes of intelligent vehicle control based on the Society of Automobile Engineers standards: (i) status sharing (class A), where CAVs share trajectory information to improve traffic flow"}, {"title": "2.2.3. Traffic Safety and Crash Risk Modeling and Prediction", "content": "Traffic safety applications involve the use of statistical and machine learning techniques to assess and predict the frequency and likelihood of traffic crashes (Chand et al., 2021). Traffic safety models are initially developed to identify patterns and factors contributing to crashes, such as driver behavior, road conditions, weather, and traffic flow characteristics, with the goal of enhancing road safety (Theofilatos and Yannis, 2014). Later on, by incorporating historical crash data and real-time information, real-time crash risk prediction models were developed predict potential high-risk situations and locations. In addition, traffic conflict based safety models have been popular to address the limitation of rareness and randomness of crash data. In general, there are three types of traffic safety models that have been widely developed and implementated in real world.\nCrash frequency prediction models, also known as safety performance functions (SPF), estimate the expected number of crashes at specific locations over a given period, enabling transportation planners to identify high-risk areas and allocate resources effectively. These models often incorporate various factors such as aggregated traffic volume, road geometry, and traffic control characteristics to achieve better prediction accuracy (Khattak et al., 2024).\nCrash severity models focus on predicting the potential outcomes of crashes, i.e., the severity of crashes. These models typically assess the impact of factors such as vehicle speed, driver and occupant characteristics, collision type, and vehicle safety features (Qin et al., 2013). Understanding crash severity helps in the development of targeted safety interventions (e.g., driver education and advanced vehicle safety features) and infrastructure improvements that can mitigate the most serious consequences of traffic accidents (Khattak and Fontaine, 2020).\nReal-time crash risk evaluation and prediction models aim to model the relationship between crash likelihood and the corresponding real-time traffic flow characteristics, and then predict the probability of crash occurrence in real-time. The prediction results can not only provide dynamic warnings or interventions designed to prevent potential crashes for drivers but also provide better predictive insights for traffic operators to improve the emergency response and reduce the incident clearance time. (Yuan et al., 2020; Yuan and Abdel-Aty, 2018; Yu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Cheng et al., 2022; Yue et al., 2020).\nSurrogate safety models provide a new perspective for traffic safety modeling and prediction given traffic crashes are extremely rare events, which is more scalable and implementable. Modeling the relationship between various"}, {"title": "2.2.4. Network Traffic Control and Optimization", "content": "While driving advisory systems and intelligent vehicle control enhance mobility at the individual vehicle level, network traffic control strategies are essential for optimizing entire transportation systems. These strategies improve travel times, reduce fuel consumption, and lower emissions, supporting sustainable urban mobility (Ugirumurera et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2022a). This process involves the systematic management and regulation of traffic flows across road networks, using real-time data and advanced algorithms to optimize traffic signals, reroute vehicles, and adjust traffic patterns.\nAmong various optimization strategies, traffic signal control is the most widely implemented. Traditional fixed-time traffic signal control, based on historical data, often fails to adapt to real-time traffic variations, leading to inefficiencies. Adaptive traffic signal control systems address these limitations by using real-time data from sensors and cameras to dynamically adjust signal timings, optimizing flow and reducing delays (Wang et al., 2018b; Abdulhai et al., 2003; Li and Ban, 2018; Li et al., 2022b). Traffic signal coordination synchronizes signals along major corridors, minimizing stops and maintaining continuous traffic flow (Bazzan, 2005; Putha et al., 2012; Li and Ban, 2020). Transit signal priority (TSP) systems further enhance efficiency by adjusting signals to reduce delays for public transit vehicles (Smith et al., 2005; He et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2020).\nRamp metering is another key strategy, regulating vehicle entry onto freeways to maintain optimal flow and prevent congestion (Papageorgiou et al., 1991; Papageorgiou and Kotsialos, 2002). It has been shown to enhance freeway throughput, increase vehicle speeds, and improve safety by reducing stop-and-go conditions (Haj-Salem and Papageorgiou, 1995; Lee et al., 2006; Smaragdis et al., 2004). Effective ramp metering relies on real-time data, predictive modeling, and adaptive algorithms (Ma et al., 2020).\nThe Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which gives the relationship between flow, density, and speed at a network level(Xu et al., 2020; Xu and Gayah, 2024), has emerged as a valuable tool for managing congestion across entire networks. MFD-based strategies, such as perimeter flow control, congestion pricing, urban road space allocation, regional vehicle routing, and area-wide signal control, are effective in optimizing network-wide traffic flow (Aboudolas and Geroliminis, 2013; Zhou and Gayah, 2021; Simoni et al., 2015; Xu and Gayah, 2023; Xu et al., 2023a; Yildirimoglu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016). Implementing these strategies requires robust data collection and advanced analytics to interpret MFD data effectively.\nOther network traffic control methods include Variable Speed Limits (VSL), which adjust speed limits based on real-time conditions (Lin et al., 2004), and Integrated Corridor Management (ICM), which optimizes overall corridor"}, {"title": "3. The Raise of Multi-agent Systems", "content": "A multi-agent system is a framework where multiple autonomous agents, each with specific capabilities, work together through coordination to achieve a common goal or solve complex problems (Vogel-Heuser et al., 2020). These agents interact, communicate, and emulate collaborative behaviors found in human and natural systems. Enhanced by emerging AI technologies and knowledge engineering, they now undertake increasingly specialized tasks (Khosla, 2012). Multi-agent systems have gained traction in research and applications requiring sophisticated problem-solving, such as smart manufacturing and healthcare (Yahouni et al., 2021; Shakshuki and Reid, 2015). The growing complexity of challenges in these domains has driven the evolution of multi-agent systems alongside Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, including LLMs and RAG (de Zarz\u00e0 et al., 2023). By leveraging the strengths of specialized agents working together, AI-powered multi-agent systems can more effectively and interactively address complex problems that require deep domain knowledge.\nA typical GenAI-powered multi-agent system includes several key components: (a) LLM agents that excel in natural language understanding and generation, (b) retrieval agents that fetch relevant data from external sources, and (c) task-specific agents that handle specialized functions like sentiment analysis, optimization, or decision-making. Together, these agents, guided by domain knowledge (e.g., ontologies and knowledge graphs), form a cohesive unit capable of addressing intricate problems more effectively than a single model alone."}, {"title": "3.1. LLM Agents: Origin and Capabilities", "content": "In recent years, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly expanded Al's capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation (Yang et al., 2024). Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, developed using the Transformer architecture, have become increasingly popular in both industry and academia (Raiaan et al., 2024). Notable examples include OpenAI's ChatGPT, GPT-3, BERT, T5, and RoBERTa. These models excel in various applications, from conversational agents to content generation, due to their ability to leverage vast textual data to capture nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual relationships. This sets them apart from traditional deep learning methods, which often require task-specific training and struggle with understanding broader contexts.\nThe flexibility and robustness of LLMs have led to their growing use in urban science research. These models are being used to analyze large volumes of textual data, extract meaningful insights, and support decision-making across sectors like building management (Jiang et al., 2024; Rane et al., 2023), natural hazard mitigation (Chandra et al., 2024; Samuel et al., 2024), energy system management (Choi et al., 2024a; Lai et al., 2024), and freight system optimization (Tupayachi et al., 2024).

Retrieval Agent for RAG", "content": "Retrieval agents was proposed to address the limitations of the early versions of LLM agents in dealing with domain-specific queries requiring specialized knowledge (Hu et al., 2023). Since these general-purpose models, trained on static text, often struggle to answer domain-specific questions or access the most up-to-date information, making them vulnerable to hallucinations (Zaki et al., 2024). Unlike the computationally expensive fine-tuning processes, which often requires a significant amounts of data to tune the parameter of a LLM, the recent emerging RAG technique presents a cost-effective solution to enhance the language models' knowledge base by enabling an external information retrieval system. The technique expand the general-purpose LLMs' ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by leveraging external knowledge sources that are specialized and domain-specific.\nRAG works by first retrieving pertinent documents from a vector database, which indexes and searches data based on vector embedding, and then generating a response using both the retrieved information and the model's internal knowledge (Cakaloglu et al., 2020). The vector database concept is crucial as it allows efficient and effective retrieval of semantically similar data points, thereby ensuring that the most relevant information is utilized during response generation. Studies have shown that integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models can significantly improve factual accuracy and reduce the incidence of hallucinations in model outputs (Lewis et al., 2020; Karpukhin et al., 2020)."}, {"title": "3.3.

Al accountability", "content": "AI accountability is a critical challenge in building multi-agent systems for ITS. Ensuring that decisions made by autonomous agents can be traced, and responsibility attributed, is essential for addressing errors, biases, and unintended outcomes. Without clear accountability mechanisms, the reliability, safety, and ethical operation of ITS could be compromised, making it crucial to implement robust accountability measures to build trust and ensure system transparency."}]}

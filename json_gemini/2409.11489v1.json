As these networked\nsystems become more dependent on AI-enabled decision support tools, the ethical challenges associated with their\ndeployment grow more complex (Whittlestone and Clarke, 2022). Traditional ethical concerns in AI\u2014such as fairness,\naccountability, and transparency\u2014take on new dimensions when applied to systems characterized by complex networks\nand optimization processes, where decisions have far-reaching societal impacts (Jobin et al., 2019).\nGovernments and organizations worldwide have responded to these ethical concerns by introducing frameworks and\nregulations aimed at ensuring trustworthy AI (Harrison and Luna-Reyes, 2022; Weaver, 2021; Aoki et al., 2024;\nMadhavan et al., 2020). Initiatives like the European Union's AI Act (Parliament and of the European Union, 2024)\nand the Biden-Harris administration's AI Bill of Rights (Biden, 2021) aim to safeguard fairness, transparency, and\naccountability in AI systems (White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2023; OECD, 2020; Radu, 2021).\nHowever, while these efforts have made significant progress, much of the existing literature focuses predominantly\non algorithmic fairness, often neglecting the broader implications of AI systems in optimization-based decision-\nmaking(Fazelpour and Lipton, 2020). The challenge remains to develop ethical guidelines that address not only\nfairness-driven algorithms but also the wider array of ethical considerations present in the entire pipeline of AI-enabled\noptimization tools.\nThis paper argues that ethical concerns in AI-enabled optimization extend beyond fairness, particularly when applied to\ncomplex networked systems. In many cases, fairness alone is insufficient to address the ethical complexities that arise\nduring data curation, model development, result interpretation, and tool implementation. For example, optimization\nproblems in power systems or supply chain networks often involve trade-offs that require careful ethical consideration to\navoid perpetuating inequities or creating unintended consequences. Thus, we emphasize the need for a comprehensive\nethical guidelines tailored to AI-enabled optimization of engineered systems that encompasses not only fairness but\nalso transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and long-term societal impact.\nThrough case studies in power systems and supply chains, this paper examines how ethical considerations manifest at\ndifferent stages of the AI-enabled optimization process. The first case study examines a collaborative decentralized\ncold supply chain designed to support underrepresented minority communities, while the second focuses on optimizing\npower grid infrastructure to mitigate wildfire risks. These cases highlight common ethical challenges\u2014such as the\nhandling of sensitive data, the transparency of modeling choices, and the interpretation of results\u2014that are central to the\nresponsible deployment of AI technologies. Rather than providing a prescriptive set of rules, this paper aims to foster\nreflection and awareness among researchers and practitioners, encouraging them to consider ethical implications at every\nstep of the decision-making process. By drawing lessons from the case studies, we seek to demonstrate that AI-enabled\ndecision support tools must go beyond optimizing for efficiency and fairness alone. To build truly responsible AI\nsystems, we must also ensure they are transparent, accountable, and inclusive, and that they align with broader societal\nvalues. This paper calls for the development of ethical guidelines tailored to AI-enabled optimization, addressing not\nonly fairness but also the ethical challenges unique to networked systems. Such guidelines will help safeguard the\nresponsible and equitable deployment of AI technologies across various sectors, ensuring that they contribute positively\nto both communities and the environment.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 sets the stage for ethical considerations in AI-enabled\noptimization and presents the optimization process pipeline. Section 3 presents the two case studies\u2014one in supply\nchain logistics and the other in electric power systems\u2014to explore the ethical challenges of AI-enabled optimization.\nSection 4 discusses the key ethical considerations across the stages of data collection, modeling, results interpretation,\nand implementation, drawing lessons from both case studies. Finally, Section 5 synthesizes the findings and calls for\nthe development of comprehensive ethical frameworks for AI-enabled decision support tools."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations in AI-Enabled Optimization", "content": "AI-enabled optimization has the potential to enhance decision-making across diverse domains, but this advancement\nmust be underpinned by ethical principles to prevent harm. Researchers must acknowledge that their models operate\nin complex, real-world environments where ethical risks, such as bias and inequity, arise at every stage-from data\ngathering to implementation (Johnson and Verdicchio, 2023). To guide AI development responsibly, ethical principles\nmust be integrated into the entire process, ensuring transparency, fairness, and societal well-being. Adoption of such\napproaches would mitigate risks such as unequal resource distribution and the amplification of bias in AI-driven systems."}, {"title": "Optimization Models", "content": "Optimization models are central to decision support tools that seek the best solution from a set of feasible options,\ntypically with the goal of maximizing efficiency or improving outcomes (Taha, 2013). AI enhances optimization by\nhandling complex, dynamic systems and large datasets more effectively than traditional methods, uncovering patterns\nand adapting to changes (Bengio et al., 2021). The interested reader is referred to (Van Hentenryck and Dalmeijer,\n2024) to learn more about the intersection of optimization and AI. However, the use of AI introduces new challenges,\nespecially regarding fairness and bias. Researchers must consider the ethical implications of how models are constructed\nand how decisions are impacted by biased or incomplete data. For instance, algorithmic fairness plays a critical role in\nensuring that AI-optimized models do not favor certain groups or reinforce systemic biases. It is essential to incorporate\nfairness criteria into the model design phase, ensuring that the solutions generated align with ethical principles and\nsocial justice goals. AI-driven optimization systems must be designed to promote equitable outcomes across diverse\ndemographic groups (Veale et al., 2018). To accomplish this, ethical principles and fairness must be intertwined in the\nprocess as not doing so could lead to unintended negative consequences."}, {"title": "Optimization Process", "content": "The optimization process is iterative, requiring continuous interaction between data, models, and solvers. At each stage,\nethical considerations arise that can affect fairness and equity in decision-making. Throughout\nthis process, researchers must engage with ethical principles that emphasize fairness and transparency, ensuring that\nAI-driven decision support tools are developed and deployed responsibly."}, {"title": "Case Studies in AI-Enabled Optimization", "content": "To illustrate practical applications of various ethical considerations, we present two case studies: one in supply\nchain/logistics and the other on electric power systems. Both case studies involve complex, networked systems where\ndecisions have far-reaching implications across interconnected components.

These examples follow the\nstructure of the optimization process outlined in Figure 1, showcasing the ethical challenges and decisions made at each\nstage within these networked systems."}, {"title": "Case Study 1: Ethical Challenges in Collaborative Decentralized Cold Food Supply Chains", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in food supply chains (Aday and Aday, 2020), particularly in rural\nareas (Phillipson et al., 2020) where both farmers and end consumers from underrepresented minority communities\nfaced significant barriers. Smallholder farmers, lacking the infrastructure and resources available to larger operations,\nwere disproportionately affected by logistical disruptions, labor shortages, and rising costs (Hammond et al., 2022). Cold\nsupply chains\u2014critical for transporting temperature-sensitive goods like food-require expensive infrastructure, such\nas refrigerated storage and transportation (Wang and Zhao, 2021), which smallholder farmers struggle to access. This\ncreates unreliable food supplies for consumers in these communities, who also experience heightened food insecurity.\nThis case study focuses on a collaborative decentralized cold supply chain in rural Wisconsin, designed to empower\nsmallholder farmers from underrepresented minority communities by pooling resources to serve their communities and\nparticipate in traditional markets. The goal is to ensure both farmers and consumers benefit from more reliable food\nsupply systems. However, ethical concerns arise regarding fairness in resource allocation and ensuring that the benefits\nof collaboration are shared equitably among all participants, especially those with fewer resources.\nKey challenges include ensuring that decision support tools reflect the needs of underrepresented minority farmers and\ntheir communities. Ethical decision-making must prioritize fairness in access to shared resources, such as transportation\nand storage, while considering the broader impact on food security for consumers in under-served areas. The goal\nis not just efficiency but also ensuring equitable benefits for both farmers and consumers, especially those from\nunderrepresented groups."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations in Collaborative Decentralized Cold Supply Chains", "content": "In developing decision support tools for collaborative decentralized cold supply chains, there are several ethical\nconcerns to address at every stage, from data collection to modeling and final implementation.

Due to historical marginaliza-\ntion, these groups often have concerns about data misuse or exploitation. Researchers must establish confidentiality\nmeasures, such as non-disclosure agreements, to protect data from competitors (i.e., larger-scale farmers) and ensure it\nis not publicly disclosed. Explicit consent for data use must be obtained, with transparency about how the data will\nbe used, and researchers must respect decisions against sharing.

The transmission grid is vital to modern life, enabling the delivery of power across large areas.\nDescribed as \"the most complex machine ever made\" (Schewe, 2007), the power grid faces increasing threats from\nnatural disasters, especially as climate change worsens. Extreme weather can damage key infrastructure, such as\nsubstations and power lines, interrupting power delivery. Investments in infrastructure, such as line upgrades or battery\nplacements, are essential but costly, making optimal planning critical. Additionally, understanding the impact on\nindividual consumers and communities, particularly marginalized groups, is crucial as long-term infrastructure decisions\nare made.\nThis case study focuses on an Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) and line undergrounding investments problem\nunder wildfire ignition risk (Pollack et al., 2024). Technical details of the OTS formulation and methods used to\nallocate ignition risk are provided in the Appendix B.1. Wildfires ignited by power lines, though rare, are often highly\ndestructive (Mitchell, 2013). To mitigate this risk, utilities often implement Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS)\nevents, de-energizing lines to prevent fires but also causing power outages (Huang et al., 2023). Power outages\ndisproportionately affect marginalized communities (Ham and Lee, 2022), including those from PSPS events. The OTS-\nPSPS problem aims to minimize wildfire risk while ensuring equitable distribution of power to vulnerable communities,\nminimizing load shedding, and allocating investments like undergrounding power lines. With utilities like PG&E\ncommitting billions to undergrounding power lines (PG&E, 2024), the question of how to fairly allocate resources is\ncritical.

Data was sourced from multiple government\ndatabases, including the Justice40 designated census tracts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nSocial Vulnerability Index (SVI), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Wildland Fire Potential Index\n(WFPI). A primary ethical concern was ensuring that the data accurately represented vulnerable populations and\nthat its use did not perpetuate historical inequities. The processes of correlating census tract data to the power grid\nand aggregating vulnerability metrics involved decisions that could potentially obscure the needs of smaller or less\nrepresented groups. For example, while the Justice40 initiative sets a national standard, local nuances may be lost when\napplying this standard across locally diverse regions like Texas.

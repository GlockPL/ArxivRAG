INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the contemporary digital landscape, the proliferation of multimedia content, encompassing text, images, and videos, presents a significant challenge: how can we efficiently summarize and comprehend these heterogeneous documents [1]? Automatic document summarization has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to distill essential information and generate succinct summaries that encapsulate the core of the original content [2]. Summarizing multimedia documents, characterized by their multifaceted content types, necessitates a system capable of accommodating this diversity while ensuring that the resultant summary is both succinct and coherent, faithfully preserving the meaning of the original document.\nIntegral to multimedia document summarization is the pivotal task of evaluating the importance of each document entity, spanning text, image, or video. This necessitates a thorough assessment of the significance of each component, determining which entities warrant inclusion in the summary. Additionally, maintaining coherence presents another challenge, as the summary must not only underscore essential entities but also present them in a manner that preserves the original meaning and structure of the document.\nTo tackle these challenges, researchers have proposed various methodologies, among which is the utilization of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Originally formulated by Mann and Thompson [3], RST provides a robust framework for analyzing and representing coherence relations within textual documents. It elucidates how different segments of a document are interconnected and contribute to its overall meaning. In our prior research, we introduced a media weighting approach that extends the conventional rhetorical structure model [4]. This extension incorporates rhetorical relations between diverse media types, thereby enhancing the modeling of multimedia documents. By leveraging RST, this approach facilitates the determination of importance, rendering it applicable to tasks such as document adaptation, automatic composition, and summary generation. Expanding upon this groundwork, our present study introduces an innovative framework for multimedia document summarization. Harnessing RST, our framework analyzes the document structure to ascertain the significance of each entity, ensuring the production of summaries that are both succinct and faithful to the original content.\nThe subsequent sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in document summarization and RST utilization. Section 3 details our proposed framework, elucidating the steps involved in entity importance determination and coherence preservation. Section 4 outlines the experimental setup and evaluation metrics used to assess our framework's performance. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper, summarizing findings and discussing future directions."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORKS", "content": "Effectively representing the intricate structures inherent in multimedia documents is crucial for various tasks such as analysis, retrieval, summarization, generation, and adaptation. Traditional models, like the four-dimensional model [5], encapsulating temporal, spatial, logical, and hypermedia dimensions, have limitations in addressing media integration, adaptation, and personalized consumption. For instance, the four-dimensional model widely used fails to comprehensively address the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of multimedia content.\nTo overcome these limitations, researchers have introduced extensions and alternative models. Andr\u00e9 et al. [6] presented a five-dimensional model, enriching it by incorporating user interaction as a fundamental dimension. In [7], this model was leveraged to assist reengineering documents based on readers' usages. Nack and Hardman [8] emphasized the importance of semantics in document modeling, enabling a more profound capture of meanings embedded within multimedia documents. The exploration into adaptive hypermedia, as seen in the work of Brusilovsky et al. [9], has delved into the customization of content based on user characteristics, adding a layer of personalization to the traditional models. In [10], the authors proposed the addition of an annotation dimension to the four model.\nGeurts et al. [11] proposed an ontology-based model, utilizing ontologies to represent domain knowledge, document content, and user profiles. This innovative approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships within multimedia documents. Additionally, Yao et al. [12] introduced a graph-based model that goes beyond structural representation and illustrates both the structural and semantic relationships between various components of multimedia content.\nIn this context, the concept of rhetorical structure, encompassing the organization and arrangement of media elements, has emerged as a critical consideration in multimedia design, significantly influencing the clarity, effectiveness, and overall appeal of a document. Despite the diversity of document forms, researchers have dedicated efforts to develop frameworks addressing this intricate aspect. Haase's [13] analysis of narrative structures in interactive multimedia applications, exploring narrative media and narrativity, contributes valuable insights into the nuanced interplay inherent in narrative design. In this context, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), introduced by Mann and Thompson [3], aligns seamlessly with the broader concept of rhetorical structure. Serving as a popular discourse structure theory, RST utilizes a tree structure to represent text coherence, making it particularly well-suited for high-level tasks such as text summarization."}, {"title": "B. Graph-based Representations of Documents", "content": "While traditional processing methods, such as the bag-of-words (BoW) model, have been widely used, they may exhibit limitations in their efficacy. The BoW model treats documents as unordered collections of terms, neglecting their sequence and relationships, thereby restricting its utility in tasks requiring an understanding of a document's structure and meaning. In response to these limitations, graph-based representations of documents emerge as a promising solution.\nBy constructing graphs that illustrate connections between terms, these representations capture both semantic nuances and structural elements of textual data [14], enhancing various natural language processing tasks like text classification and information retrieval. However, creating meaningful graphs from raw documents presents challenges, prompting researchers to employ strategies such as syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, and topic modeling to augment graph structures with valuable content for downstream applications.\nGraph-based representations have proven effective in various natural language processing tasks. For instance, Fei et al. [15] introduced a span-graph neural model for biomedical texts, capturing intricate relationships between terms. Another study by Fei et al. [16] addressed semantic role labeling using a label-aware graph convolutional network (LA-GCN) to encode syntactic arcs and labels into BERT-based word representations, capturing rich semantic and syntactic information.\nIn social network analysis, Khanday et al. [17] demonstrated the effectiveness of graph-based representations in detecting propaganda and propagandistic communities. Graph-based representations extend to multimedia documents, as shown by Hochin and Nishida [18], who introduced a model capturing semantic relationships between text and images. In multimedia recommendation, Zhang et al. [19] proposed techniques for learning item-item structures across modalities, and Wei et al. [19] suggested a hierarchical user intent graph network."}, {"title": "C. Multimedia Document Summarization", "content": "The field of multimedia document summarization has seen significant advancements over the years due to the exponential growth of multimedia content [8]. The task involves extracting key information from multimedia documents, which comprise text, images, and videos. The challenge lies in effectively summarizing these diverse types of content while maintaining the coherence and relevance of the summary.\nGraph-based techniques have been extensively employed in multimedia document summarization. In [8], two methods for summarizing multimedia content are proposed. Their approach involved creating a graph representation of the document and using weighting algorithms to assign importance values to the nodes, which represent different units of content. However, this approach does not consider the inherent structure and coherence of the document, which can lead to summaries that lack context and relevance.\nIn addition to graph-based techniques, the Semantic Adaptation Framework has been proposed as a method for dealing with the semantics of document composition by transforming the relations between multimedia objects [3]. This technique also has the capability of suppressing multimedia objects, which is useful for summarizing multimedia documents.\nRecent advancements in the field have seen the introduction of multimodal approaches to document summarization. Qiu et al. [21] proposed the Multimodal Hierarchical Multimedia Summarization (MHMS) framework which interacts with visual and language domains to generate both video and textual summaries. While this represents a significant advancement in the field, the MHMS framework does not consider user preferences and desired summary time, which can limit the personalization and contextual relevance of summaries.\nSemantic graphs for web document visualization have also been explored [4]. These graphs provide a visual representation of the semantic relationships between different units of content, facilitating the understanding and navigation of complex multimedia documents. However, these semantic graphs do not assign importance values to the units of content, which can result in summaries that do not accurately represent the original document."}, {"title": "D. Identified Gaps and Rationale for the Proposed Framework", "content": "While significant progress characterizes multimedia document summarization, scrutiny uncovers noteworthy gaps in existing methodologies. These limitations underscore the need for a refined approach, motivating the development of our framework. Graph-based approaches, exemplified in [8], excel in assigning importance values to individual nodes but often struggle to maintain the inherent coherence and structure of the entire document. This challenge becomes pronounced when aiming for comprehensive summaries that encapsulate the document's meaning and context. In multimodal approaches, like the MHMS framework [21], advancements in handling diverse content types are evident. However, a lack of personalized summarization persists, as these approaches overlook user preferences and desired time frames, limiting adaptability to individual needs. Current models, including the Semantic Adaptation Framework [3], may not fully exploit the inherent structure of multimedia documents during summarization, resulting in summaries lacking cohesiveness and context.\nIn response, our framework for multimedia document summarization is introduced. It aims to overcome existing challenges by emphasizing document coherence, leveraging Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to capture rhetorical relations between different media types. The framework goes beyond conventional graph-based representations by integrating user preferences and desired summary time into weighting algorithms, enabling a personalized and contextually relevant summarization experience."}, {"title": "III. A FRAMEWORK FOR DOCUMENT SUMMARIZATION", "content": "Summarizing multimedia documents is a challenging task due to the diverse media types and intricate content relationships.

This approach ensures a systematic and comprehensive process for multimedia document summarization."}, {"title": "A. Document Modeling and Specification", "content": "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) provides a powerful foundation for understanding and representing the coherence relationships within textual content. In the context of multimedia document summarization, we capitalize on the inherent capabilities of RST to enhance the representation and analysis of complex structures encompassing diverse media types. At its core, RST captures authorial writing styles and intent by representing a document as a tree-like structure. This structure comprises leaves as Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) and internal nodes as contiguous text spans with rhetorical relations. EDUs are coherent textual units, ranging from simple sentences to complex clauses, each possessing independent syntactic and semantic meaning. The construction of the RST tree structure involves the segmentation of text into EDUs, followed by the sequential merging of adjacent units based on the presence of rhetorical relations. These relations encapsulate the interconnections between two non-overlapping text spans, resulting in a cohesive whole. Each text span is designated as a nucleus or satellite based on the relation."}, {"title": "2) 3.1.2 Bridging Rhetorical Structure and Document Components in Specification", "content": "Building upon the foundation laid by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) in our framework, the document specification process serves as a pivotal step that aligns with both RST principles and the unique dimensions introduced in the extended model. During this phase, the multimedia document (D) undergoes a comprehensive analysis to ascertain its structure and content, comprising various media types.\nThe specification process involves identifying distinct units (U = {ul, u2, .., un}), each representing a coherent piece of information within the document. These units, whether Elementary Simple Units (ESUs) or Elementary Composite Units (ECUs), play a crucial role in contributing to the overall rhetorical relationships within the document.\nTo align with the principles of Rhetorical Structure Theory, different media types are analyzed using appropriate techniques. For textual content, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be employed to identify paragraphs, sentences, and finer-grained units. Simultaneously, computer vision algorithms are utilized for images and videos to detect meaningful frames or segments. This dual approach ensures that the document specification process not only considers the text-based rhetorical relationships but also extends its reach to visual and auditory elements. By doing so, our framework encapsulates a more holistic understanding of the multimedia document's discourse, acknowledging the diversity of media types.\nBeyond serving as a foundational step for subsequent processes, document specification significantly contributes to the rhetorical structure outlined by RST. The identified units, representing coherent pieces of information, are categorized based on their nature and role within the document. This categorization plays a pivotal role in understanding and enhancing the rhetorical relationships, as each unit contributes uniquely to the document's discourse.\nBreaking down the multimedia document into units allows for the capture of important elements and their interconnections. This detailed analysis proves crucial in generating a coherent and informative summary. The resulting units (U = {paragraph1, sentencel, sentence2, imagel, videol, video2, ...}) represent not only isolated pieces of information but also interconnected elements that influence the overall understanding of the topic.\nExample: Consider a multimedia document on \"The History of Space Exploration.\" During document specification, the text is meticulously divided into paragraphs and sentences, while images and videos are segmented into key frames and clips. The resulting units represent distinct pieces of information (U = {paragraph1, sentencel, sentence2, imagel, videol, video2, ...}), contributing synergistically to the overall understanding of the topic and influencing the rhetorical structure outlined by RST."}, {"title": "B. User Profile for Personalizing Summarization", "content": "Building upon the document specification process and the enriched rhetorical structure, our framework integrates user profiles into the multimedia document summarization process. This integration aims to personalize summaries according to individual user preferences, interests, and requirements.\nThe user profile is instrumental in personalizing the summarization, capturing essential information about the user's background, topic preferences, desired level of detail, and areas of interest. This information aligns the summarization output with the user's expectations, ensuring a relevant and engaging summary. The introduction of the user profile involves gathering information through various means such as user surveys, explicit feedback, browsing history, or previous interactions with the summarization system. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the user's preferences, enriching the summarization process with personalized insights. Once constructed, the user profile integrates into the summarization process, enabling the system to adapt its output based on the user's preferences, thereby enhancing the relevance and usefulness of the generated summary.\nThe user profile influences both the content and style of the generated summary. For example, if the user has a background in astrophysics, the system may prioritize detailed information about space exploration milestones and scientific discoveries. If the user prefers concise summaries, the system may focus on delivering key insights while omitting less critical details. The introduction of the user profile transforms summarization into a personalized experience, allowing the system to cater to the specific needs and interests of each user. This adaptive approach results in summaries that are not only more relevant and engaging but also uniquely tailored to individual preferences.\nExample: Consider a user profile for a space enthusiast with a background in astronomy within the context of The History of Space Exploration example. The user profile, P, includes details about the user's educational background, specific interests in space missions and astronomical discoveries, and a preference for detailed summaries. By integrating this user profile into the summarization process, the system can generate summaries that prioritize in-depth coverage of significant space missions, scientific breakthroughs, and historical events related to space exploration. This ensures that the summary aligns with the user's preferences, providing relevant and engaging content tailored to their specific interests."}, {"title": "C. Temporal Control in Document Summarization", "content": "Building upon the personalized summarization enabled by user profiles, our framework introduces an additional layer of user control and convenience-temporal management. Recognizing the crucial role of time in multimedia documents, the introduction of the desired summary time is a key step in controlling the length and duration of the generated summary.\nThe desired summary time serves as a fundamental constraint, providing users the flexibility to customize the summary length based on their preferences and constraints. This temporal dimension is particularly significant in multimedia document summarization, where diverse content types may have varying information density and duration.\nDuring the summarization process, the desired summary time is a primary consideration, ensuring the generated summary adheres to the specified duration. Advanced algorithms and techniques are utilized to select and prioritize the most relevant and informative entities from the document while maintaining the desired summary time. This step ensures the summary is not only concise but also time-efficient, meeting the user's specific requirements.\nThe implementation of the desired summary time optimizes both the length and duration of the summary, offering users a convenient and time-saving means to consume essential content from the document. This temporal management allows users to efficiently extract key information without the need to review the entire document, enhancing the accessibility and digestibility of the summary.\nExample: Consider a user who is interested in The History of Space Exploration document and wishes to obtain a summary within a limited timeframe of 10 minutes (T = 10 mn). The summarization system will generate a concise summary encapsulating the most crucial events, missions, and scientific breakthroughs in space exploration\u2014all within the specified 10-minute constraint. This ensures that the summary is not only comprehensive but also time-efficient, providing the user with a thorough understanding of the subject within the desired timeframe."}, {"title": "D. 3.4 Rhetorical Structure Graph Construction", "content": "In the dynamic field of multimedia document summarization, establishing a robust representation of rhetorical structure is foundational for effective summarization. Drawing inspiration from established work [1], our framework adopts a graph-based approach to construct a model featuring nodes, edges, and associated properties. This approach enriches the portrayal of document coherence, aligning with the nuanced relationships highlighted in the rhetorical structure.\nNodes: Representing Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs), these nodes encapsulate fundamental units of discourse structure, such as sentences or image captions. They serve as the building blocks for coherent document representation.\nEdges: Labeled with types like Cause, Contrast, or Elaboration, these rhetorical relationships connect nodes, creating an interconnected graph that ensures coherence within the document. The identification of these relationships is guided by rhetorical cues and coherence markers.\nNode Weights: Reflecting the importance of EDUs in the document context, node weights contribute to prioritizing content during the subsequent summarization steps.\nTo construct the rhetorical relations graph (G), we use the following algorithm:\nInitialize an empty graph G: Begin with an empty canvas, preparing for the construction process.\nIdentify document units (U = {U1, U2, ..., Un}): Referencing the units identified during the document specification step (Section 3.2), this step captures various media types, including sentences, images, and videos.\nDetermine relationships R(ui) for each unit u\u2081: Guided by rhetorical cues and coherence markers, relationships between units are discerned, forming the basis for the graph structure.\nAdd nodes to graph G: Each unit ui corresponds to a"}, {"title": "E. Weighting and Ranking of Entities", "content": "Unit weighting plays a crucial role in determining the relative importance of each unit within a document, enhancing our understanding of relationships among document units, and facilitating unit ranking based on significance. The importance of a unit is assessed considering factors such as its role as a nucleus or satellite, orbital position, and relationships with other units.\nThe weighting algorithm we proposed in our work traverses the graph, assigning weights based on relationships, unit types (ESU or ECU), and hierarchical structure [4]. The algorithm ensures a nuanced representation, contributing to improved document comprehension and navigation. The algorithm consists of steps outlined in the following algorithm.\nAlgorithm: Weighting Algorithm\nStart with the first inserted unit, assigned the value P.\nIf the starting unit is a composite elementary unit, find its main unit and assign it the value P.\nTraverse the graph of relationships using the following procedure:\nAt each new relationship, check the type of the destination unit:\nIf it is an elementary simple unit:\nIf it is a multi-nucleus relationship, the units linked by the relationship will have the same importance value as the starting unit.\nIf it is a nucleus/satellite relationship:\nIf it is a satellite, its value is calculated based on its orbit (sum of the weights of all incoming edges).\nIf it is a nucleus, increment its value by 1 compared to the value P.\nIf it is a composite elementary unit, find its main unit and continue the weighting with that unit.\nThe weighting algorithm considers the significance of each unit in the document, using it to assign weights to each unit."}, {"title": "2) 3.5.2 Graph Levels Computation Algorithm", "content": "To comprehend the hierarchical relationships inherent in multimedia documents, our algorithm assigns levels to each unit through a meticulous depth-first traversal. This process is instrumental in unveiling the hierarchical structure of the document, facilitating a clearer representation of relationships between nuclei and satellites.\nAlgorithm: Graph Levels Computation\nStart with the first inserted unit, assigned level 0.\nFor each new relationship:\nIf the destination unit is an elementary simple unit, increment its level by 1.\nIf it is a composite elementary unit, find its main unit and continue computing levels with that unit.\nThis algorithm systematically establishes hierarchical levels for document units, ensuring a structured understanding of their relationships within the rhetorical structure. The depth-first traversal allows for a comprehensive exploration of these relationships, contributing to the overall effectiveness of the summarization process.\nExample: In the illustrative example The History of Space Exploration, the rhetorical relations graph is meticulously constructed with an emphasis on relationships and hierarchical structure. The application of the Graph Levels Computation Algorithm helps to unveil the hierarchical organization of units, making it evident how different elements, such as paragraphs, sentences, images, and videos, are interconnected. This hierarchical understanding, coupled with unit weighting, plays a pivotal role in identifying significant units, ultimately contributing to the creation of a nuanced and coherent summary that effectively captures the essence of the multimedia document."}, {"title": "F.

Treatment of Cases of Equal Weighting:", "content": "In situations where entities possess equivalent weights, supplementary strategies are employed to resolve ambiguity and guarantee the production of an optimal summary. The methodology adapts according to the type of media and the roles designated within the rhetorical structure, thereby fostering flexibility and user participation to fine-tune the summarization process.\nEntities of different media types: user preferences steer the decision-making process by forming a hierarchy among various media types. The entity linked with the user's favored media type is given priority in the final summary.\nEntities of the same media type: the algorithm evaluates the role of each entity, leveraging the partial order derived from rhetorical relations. Entities playing more influential roles, such as expressing main ideas or central concepts, are given precedence.\nPersisting equal weights: user intervention becomes mandatory, enabling users to make the ultimate decision based on their individual preferences.\nThe algorithm addressing cases of equal weighting unfolds as follows:\nAlgorithm: Treatment of Cases of Equal Weighting\nInput: Weighted and ranked entities\nOutput: Finalized summary entities\nIterate through the weighted and ranked entities.\nIdentify groups of entities with equal weights.\nFor groups of entities with different media types:\nRespect user preferences by defining a hierarchy among media types.\nIncorporate the entity aligned with the user's preferred media type into the finalized summary.\nFor groups of entities with the same media type:\nEvaluate the entity's role based on the partial order derived from rhetorical relations.\nPrioritize entities with more influential roles (e.g., main ideas, central concepts) in the finalized summary.\nIf equal weights persist:\nFacilitate user intervention to select an entity.\nEmpower users to make the final decision based on their preferences.\nFinalize the summary entities, considering the resolved cases of equal weighting.\nReturn the finalized summary entities.\nThis algorithm systematically addresses equal weighting situations, factoring in user preferences and the rhetorical roles of entities. By seamlessly incorporating user input and considering the structural significance of entities, the algorithm ensures the generation of an optimal summary that aligns with the user's preferences and encapsulates the document's key ideas.\nExample: In the example of The History of Space Exploration, envision a scenario where two images exhibit equal weights. To resolve this, the algorithm leans on user media preferences. If the user favors images over text, the image entity is integrated into the finalized summary. Conversely, if the user prefers text, priority is given to the text entity. In parallel scenarios with two equally weighted sentences, their roles within rhetorical relations determine the prioritization. Should one sentence play a more central or pivotal role, it gains prominence in the finalized summary. Should equal weights persist, the algorithm defers to user intervention, allowing users to make decisions based on their preferences.

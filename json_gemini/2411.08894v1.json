These\nindividuals often experience earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs compared to the general\npopulation, highlighting the urgency of this issue. Despite established research on the high prevalence\nof MLTCs in the ID population, the specific patterns of co-occurrence and temporal progression of\nthese conditions remain largely unexplored. This study presents an innovative unsupervised approach\nfor examining and characterising clusters of MLTC in individuals with ID, based on their shared\ndisease trajectories. Using a dataset of electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals\nwith intellectual disabilities, encompassing primary and secondary care data in Wales from 2000 to\n2021, this study analyses the time sequences of ordered disease diagnoses. The study population\ncomprised 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with a mean of 4.5 \u00b1 3 long-term conditions (LTCs) per\npatient. Significant pairwise disease associations were identified, and their temporal directionality\nwas assessed. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, spectral clustering, was applied\nto the shared disease trajectories, grouping them based on common temporal patterns. Distinct\nMLTC clusters were identified for both males and females, stratified by age groups (<45 and \u226545\nyears). For males under 45, a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while\nthree clusters were identified for older males, with the largest characterised by circulatory system\nconditions (51.8%). In females under 45, one cluster was found with digestive system conditions", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) face a significantly higher risk of developing a range of physical and mental\nhealth conditions compared to the general population. These conditions often occur at a younger age and lead to poorer\noutcomes, owing to a combination of genetic, behavioural, and social factors [1, 2, 3]. Studies show a much higher\noccurrence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) in this population [2]. MLTC, defined as two or more conditions,\nin addition to intellectual disabilities, is linked to premature death and poorer quality of life [4]. Despite this, there\nappear to be only a few studies reporting the prevalence of MLTC (two or more conditions in addition to intellectual\ndisabilities) conducted on a large scale [2, 5], but no studies were found to reveal patterns of MLTC and conditions\nmore likely to co-occur together in this population.\nThe growing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled significant advances in addressing clinical\nchallenges, enhancing diagnostic capabilities, and improving patient outcomes [6, 7, 8]. In addition to enabling\nstudies on co-occurring conditions, the longitudinal nature of EHR provides a unique opportunity to uncover temporal\nassociations and trajectories between conditions. Importantly, chronic health conditions frequently co-occur more than\nexpected by chance, often as a consequence of shared risk factors, pathogenicity, or their treatment [9]. However, most\nprior studies have not incorporated the time dimension due to the short time span of the available data [10, 11].\nOnly recently have a few large-scale analyses assessed disease trajectories by evaluating temporal ordering of co-\nmorbidity pairs over time in general population [12, 13, 14]. Many studies further develop the framework initially\nproposed by Jensen et al. [12], who described general principles for temporal trajectory analysis using Danish national\ndata. For instance, Siggaard et al. [15] published a browser of these results, while J\u00f8rgensen and Brunak [16] focused\non chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) trajectories. Hu et al. [17] linked the data to a cancer registry to\ninvestigate pre-diagnosis trajectories. The Jensen principles have been applied, with modifications, to other populations\nincluding post-depression trajectories in UK Biobank [18], and end-of-life trajectories in California [19]. Furthermore,\nGiannoula et al. [13, 20] proposed a framework to detect and cluster co-morbidity pairs and shared trajectories over\ntime using a dynamic time warping (DTW)-based unsupervised technique in Spanish data, and later extended this to\ninclude genetic information in the clustering step. Such trajectory analyses can reveal complex, time-ordered condition\nassociations, as well as MLTC patterns to enable better understanding of disease progression for improved prediction\noutcomes.\nIn this study, we propose a computational framework for the analysis of temporal MLTC by leveraging EHRs in 13069\nadults diagnosed with ID in Wales, incorporating 40 long-term conditions (LTCs) from both primary and secondary\ncare data. While most prior studies have applied temporal trajectory analysis to secondary care data and ICD-9 or -10\ncodes [12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], with only one study using primary care data [21], our approach utilises both\nto fully capture MLTC, as most chronic conditions are treated in general practice. This approach highlights several\ndifferences in MLTC patterns between male and female sub-populations across different age groups, acknowledging sex\nand age as crucial factors in understanding MLTC. The primary contributions of this research include statistical analysis\nto identify significant temporal condition pairs, identification of shared MLTC trajectories, construction of a network of\nall shared trajectories, and identification of trajectory clusters using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm."}, {"title": "2 Materials and Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Study Design and Participants", "content": "This study focused on Welsh residents aged 18 and older with intellectual disability and at least one long-term condition\n(LTC) between 1st January 2000, and 31st December 2021.

This method consists of four key steps: constructing a trajectory\ncondition network, developing a condition similarity metric based on shortest paths, creating a trajectory similarity\nmatrix, and applying spectral clustering. These steps are described as follows.\nStep 1. The first step is about constructing a trajectory condition network. A network of all trajectories was constructed\nto explore the associations between conditions across multiple trajectories and define a similarity metric among them\n(Figure 1). Let G = (N, E) be an undirected graph (or network graph) where N is the set of nodes (conditions) and E\nis the set of edges. Each edge $e_{i,j} \\in E$ connects two conditions $c_i$ and $c_j$, where $i, j \\in 1, 2, . . ., k$, where k is the total\nnumber of unique conditions across all trajectories.\nStep 2. To quantify similarity between trajectory conditions we developed a condition similarity metric based on the\nshortest path problem in graph theory. The weight w of an edge $e_{i,j}$, where $w : E \\rightarrow R$, is defined as:\n$w(e_{i,j}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(e_{i,j})}}$ (1)\nwhere $f(e_{i,j}), f : E \\rightarrow R$, is the frequency of edges between conditions c\u2081 and cj in the network. This weight function\nassigns lower weights to more frequent edges, effectively making frequently co-occurring conditions closer in the\nnetwork graph.\nLet $P = (C_1, C_2, ..., C_n)$ be a path from c\u2081 to cn in network graph G. The shortest path length is given by:\n$shortest path(C_1, C_n) = min \\sum_{P} \\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} w(e_{l,l+1})$ (2)\nwhere the minimum is taken over all possible paths from c\u2081 to cn in the graph, and $w(e_{l,l+1})$ is the weight of the edge\nbetween consecutive conditions cr and cl+1 in the path. We compute this shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm [25].\nTo convert the shortest path lengths into similarity scores ranging from 0 to 1, we take the inverse:\n$sim(c_i, C_j) = \\frac{1}{shortest path(c_i, C_j)}$ (3)\nThis transformation ensures that conditions with shorter path lengths between them (i.e., more closely related) have\nhigher similarity scores."}, {"title": null, "content": "Step 3. To assess the overall similarity between trajectories, we constructed an n \u00d7 n symmetric similarity matrix,\nwhere n is the total number of trajectories (Figure 1). The similarity between two trajectories, traji and trajj, is\ncalculated as the mean of the shortest path similarities between their respective conditions. This can be expressed as:\n$sim_{traj} (traj_i, traj_j) = \\frac{1}{|traj_i||traj_j|} \\sum_{c_i\\in{traj_i}} \\sum_{c_j\\in{traj_j}} sim(c_i, C_j)$ (4)\nwhere |traji| and |trajj| are the numbers of conditions in trajectories i and j respectively, $i, j \\in 1, 2, . . ., n$ where n is\nthe total number of trajectories, and sim(ci, cj) is the shortest path similarity between conditions ci and cj as defined\nin Eq. 3.\nStep 4. To identify clusters of highly similar trajectories based on their condition similarities, we applied spectral\nclustering to the precomputed trajectory similarity matrix (simtraj). This unsupervised machine learning algorithm\npartitions the data by exploiting the eigenstructure of the similarity matrix. We implemented spectral clustering using\nthe Scikit-Learn library with default parameter settings [26]. The algorithm treats the trajectory similarity matrix as a\nweighted graph adjacency matrix, performs a spectral embedding of the data points into a lower-dimensional space, and\nthen clusters the embedded points using the k-means algorithm.

A key finding\nwas that its prevalence was higher in those under 45 years (35%) compared to those 45 and above (31%).

For males under 45 years, neurological conditions emerged as the predominant health concern,"}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Aim and key findings: This study presents a novel approach for the identification and temporal analysis of LTC\ntrajectories in adults with intellectual disabilities using both primary and secondary care data. By employing an\nunsupervised clustering method on trajectories of a large dataset of electronic health records, we have uncovered distinct\npatterns of co-morbidity and disease trajectories that vary significantly across sex and age groups. Our findings reveal\na high prevalence of MLTCs in the ID population, with 85.9% of individuals experiencing two or more long-term\nconditions. This aligns with previous research highlighting the complex health needs of this population [1, 28]. The\naverage of 4.5 long-term conditions per patient further emphasises the complexity of health management in this group.\nSex differences: Our analysis demonstrated significant sex differences in the prevalence of LTCs among adults with\nID, while also identifying common patterns. Mental illness and epilepsy emerged as the most prevalent conditions\nacross both sexes, with mental illness affecting more than 30% and epilepsy affecting approximately 30% of both males\nand females. This prevalence aligns with previous findings in the literature [5]. However, clear sex differences were\napparent in other conditions. Females exhibited a higher prevalence of thyroid disorders (30.8%) compared to males\n(14.1%), and anaemia affected 20% of females compared to 14% of males. Females also showed increased prevalence\nof endocrine, skeletal, and digestive diseases, a finding consistent with previous research [29]. Our investigation of\ntemporal co-morbidities revealed that some diseases displayed opposite temporal associations in males and females for\ncertain pairs of conditions. For instance, we observed that in females under 45 years, epilepsy tended to precede thyroid\ndisorders, while this association was not significant in males of any age group. This finding highlights the importance\nof investigating sex-stratified disease trajectories, as the temporal direction between diseases can vary depending on sex\n[30].\nAge-related patterns: Age-related differences were apparent in condition patterns between < 45 years) and \u2265 45 years\nadults with ID. Under 45 groups showed a predominance of neurological (such as epilepsy and dementia), digestive\n(including dysphagia and chronic constipation), and mental health conditions, consistent with previous research in the\nID population [31, 32]. In males under 45 years, neurological conditions accounted for 32.4% of the identified cluster,\nwhile digestive system conditions were most prevalent (24.6%) in females of the same age group.\nIn the over 45 groups, circulatory system conditions emerged as a primary concern for both sexes with ID. We found\na higher prevalence of CHD, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, hypertension, kidney disease, and diabetes in older\nadults with ID. The co-occurrence of these conditions is particularly noteworthy, as it mirrors the complex interplay of\ncardiovascular and renal health observed in the general population [33]. Furthermore, the strong association between\nhypertension and various other cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and CHD, aligns\nwith patterns seen in the broader population [34]. The emergence of these circulatory and metabolic conditions as\npredominant health concerns in older adults with ID underscores the need for targeted, comprehensive healthcare\nstrategies across different age groups.\nMortality and hospitalisation: Across all age groups and clusters, males generally exhibited slightly higher mortality\nrates and percentages compared to females\na pattern observed in the general population but appears to be more\npronounced in individuals with intellectual disabilities [35]. Our analysis revealed a strong association between\ncirculatory system conditions and both increased mortality and extended hospitalisations, particularly in older adults,\nhighlighting these conditions as the most prevalent cause of death in the identified clusters. While mental health\nconditions and neurological issues are prevalent across all groups, their impact on mortality appears less direct\ncompared to circulatory and certain digestive system conditions. However, mental conditions significantly contribute\nto extended hospital care needs and overall quality of life, especially in younger adults with ID [36]. We observed a\nclear association between higher rates of long hospital stays and increased mortality in specific clusters of the older\npopulation. For instance, in males \u2265 45 years, cluster 1 exhibited both the highest rate of long stays (84.1%) and a high\nmortality rate (3.9 per 100 patient-years). Lastly, our study underscores the value of temporality in predicting both\nco-morbidity and mortality [37].\nLimitations: The reliance on clinical records may result in underdiagnosis of certain conditions, particularly those with\nsubtle presentations in the ID population. Moreover, our analysis was constrained by limited ethnic diversity in the\ndataset.\nConclusion: In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive, data-driven overview of MLTC trajectory patterns in\nadults with intellectual disabilities. By revealing distinct clusters of conditions and their progression over time, our\nfindings underscore the complex interplay of age, sex, and health conditions in adults with intellectual disabilities and\nprovide a foundation for more targeted, personalised healthcare strategies. Our work contributes to this shift by offering\na nuanced understanding of how MLTCs manifest and progress in the ID population. Future research should aim to\nvalidate these clusters in diverse populations and investigate the underlying mechanisms of the observed progression\npatterns."}]}

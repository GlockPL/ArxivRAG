INTRODUCTION", "content": "LLMS are sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) sys-tems designed to process and integrate various types of data, including text, images, videos, audio, and physiological sequential data [1], [2], [3]. As we navigate the eraof multimodal data fusion, marked by rapid advancementsin information technology and an explosive increase in datavolume, the capabilities of single-modality systems no longersuffice for complex real-world tasks [4], [5], [6]. Thus, thedevelopment of MLLMs is not only an inevitable trend intechnological evolution but also a critical enhancement forimproving the effectiveness of AI applications. By synergizinginformation from multiple data sources, MLLMs cultivate amore comprehensive and accurate representation of informa-tion, this capability not only unlocks significant potential butalso demonstrates substantial practical application value acrossa diverse range of fields. The integration of diverse datasetstailors MLLMs to perform more effectively, establishing themas indispensable next-generation techniques in the ongoingquest to harness the full potential of AI technologies [7], [8],[9]. Notably, MLLMs have shown remarkable performanceacross diverse multimodal tasks, including language, image,video, and audio processing. These models excel in integratingmultimodal information to enhance the effectiveness of multi-modal tasks.\nIn Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as textgeneration and machine translation, MLLMs leverage images,video, and audio to provide contextual support, enhancingthe accuracy and expressiveness of the generated text [10],[11], [12]. These models also excel in sentiment analysisand dialog systems by integrating multimodal information toimprove understanding and generation capabilities. In par-ticular, MLLMs transform NLP by incorporating visual andauditory data, thus enriching text generation and machinetranslation [13], [14], [15]. These models enhance the accuracyand expressiveness of the generated text, providing nuancedcontextual support that traditional models cannot. In sentimentanalysis and dialogue systems, MLLMs are capable of the inte-gration of multimodal information, which further deepens theunderstanding of system and response capabilities, presentinga leap forward in human-computer interaction [16], [17].\nIn addition, in the vision tasks, MLLMs significantly en-hance improves task comprehension, analysis, and genera-tion. Integrating textual descriptions and image instructionscommands allows for more accurate tasks such as imageclassification, target detection, and image annotation. Forinstance, MLLMs such as GPT-4V [13], and Gemini [18]combine image content with natural language descriptionsto produce more vivid and precise annotation results. Thesemodels also show progress in image generation, creating im-ages from textual descriptions or enabling cross-modal imagestyle migration, thus broadening the possibilities within thisfield. Meanwhile, video processing poses unique challengesdue to its complexity. Nevertheless, the advent of MLLMShas propelled forward the capabilities of language models inthis domain. Models like NEXT-GPT [19] and Sora [20] arepioneering multimodal video generation, producing richer andmore realistic video content by learning from multimodal data.Furthermore, advancements in intelligent video understandingtechnologies, such as VideoChat [21] and Video-LLaVA [22],have significantly enhanced the ability to analyze and processvideo content. These developments promise enhanced userexperiences in virtual reality, video games, and educationalapplications.\nFurthermore, In audio tasks, MLLMs bring a new tech-nological change to audio processing tasks. Traditional au-dio processing usually relies on unimodal signal processingmethods, such as speech recognition [23] or audio classifi-cation [24], which have limitations in processing complexmultimodal data.MLLMs are able to understand better andgenerate audio-related content by combining audio signalswith textual and visual information through the combinationof Large Language Models (LLMs). For example, in speechgeneration tasks, MLLMs can utilize textual and visual in-formation to generate more natural and contextually relevantspeech output [25], [26]. In audio understanding tasks, thesemodels can perform sentiment recognition, audio classifica-tion, or audio event detection more accurately by combiningvisual cues and textual descriptions. In addition, MLLMs showstrong potential in tasks such as cross-modal audio-text trans-lation, audio soundtrack generation, and multimodal sentimentanalysis [27], [18]. These technological advances not onlyimprove the effectiveness of audio processing, but also expandits scenarios in real-world applications such as smart homes,virtual assistants, movie and television production, etc.\nAs shown in Fig I, we summarize MLLMs from recentyears. This paper reviews the current state of the art of MLLMapplications, introduces the basic concepts and main architec-tures of MLLMs in Section 2, describes their performance indifferent domains to identify their strengths and weaknessesin Section 3, highlights the transformative impact of MLLMsthrough a comparative analysis in Section 4, and providesa roadmap for future research in Section 5.

OVERVIEW OF MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS", "content": "Overall, MLLMs represent a significant advancement in thefield of artificial intelligence and machine learning, embodyingthe capability to process and interpret a diverse data typeincluding text, images, audio, and video [28], [29], [30]. Byintegrating and synthesizing data from these different modal-ities, MLLMs achieve a more comprehensive and preciseunderstanding and generation of information [3].\nIn particular, MLLMs are sophisticated and comprehensivesystems engineered to handle and decode multimodal dataconcurrently. The core principle of MLLMs lies in the inte-gration and interplay of varied modalities, which significantlyamplifies the effectiveness of the models. This multimodalapproach not only enhances the understanding of individualdata types but also fosters a more nuanced interaction be-tween them, thereby expanding the scope and accuracy ofAI applications. For instance, in tasks such as image caption-ing, MLLMs leverage both text and visual data to produceaccurate and contextually relevant descriptions of images.This synergy enables the models to surpass the limitationsof single-modality systems, offering richer and more detailedoutputs. Additionally, the combination of audio and visualdata can greatly improve the performance of tasks like videounderstanding and annotation, making MLLMs invaluable forapplications requiring detailed multimedia analysis.\nBy harnessing the collective strengths of various data types,MLLMs not only enhance the capability of AI to interpretand interact with the world but also pave the way for ground-breaking developments in how machines understand complex,multifaceted information."}, {"title": "B. Main Components of Multimodal Large Language Models", "content": "A MLLM harnesses several vital components to efficientlyprocess and integrate data from diverse modalities. Thesecomponents are designed to transform raw input from varioussources into actionable insights, tailoring these models incred-ibly versatile and effective. The architecture of these modelscan be broadly categorized into three main components: themultimodal input encoder, the feature fusion mechanism, andthe multimodal output decoder.\n1) Mutimodal Input Encoder: The multimodal input en-coder is a vital component in MLLMs, designed to transformraw input data from various modalities into a structured formatthat the model can process effectively. This crucial module isspecialized in handling different types of data, ensuring thateach data form is optimally encoded to contribute effectivelyto the model's overall function. Here's how the encoder worksfor each data type:\nText: For textual data, the encoder utilizes technologies likeembedding layers, which map words into vectors of continu-ous numbers, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), or moreadvanced transformers that manage long-range dependenciesand context within text.\nImages: Visual data is processed using state-of-the-art ar-chitectures such as Vision Transformers (ViT) [31], which treatparts of an image as sequences to better capture relationships,or Residual Networks (ResNet) [32], which help in learningdeeper features without losing context through layers.\nAudio: Audio data is analyzed using models like C-Former[33], HuBERT [34], BEATs [35], or Whisper [36]. Eachof these models is tailored to capture the unique propertiesof sound, from basic tones to complex spoken language,enhancing the model's ability to interpret auditory informationaccurately.\nSequential Data: For sequential data such as EEG andheartbeats, the encoder employs a combination of 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. This setup is particularly effec-tive in picking up temporal and spatial patterns in data, whichis crucial for early diagnostics in medical applications.\nUniversal Encoder: A more recent innovation is the univer-sal encoder, which aims to standardize the encoding processacross highly diverse data types, including audio, video, andfunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This encoderleverages a generalized approach to handle and integratemultiple forms of data, promoting consistency and efficiencyin data processing. Each of these encoders converts raw inputsinto feature vectors, which are then transformed into a fixed-length feature sequence. This standardization is critical as itprepares the data for further processing, ensuring that thesubsequent layers of the model can perform feature fusionand decoding effectively.\nBy accommodating and optimizing the initial processingof varied data types, the multimodal input encoder not onlyenhances the model's performance but also expands its appli-cability across different fields. Whether it's improving the ac-curacy of image captioning, enriching the context of machinetranslation, or advancing the precision of diagnostic tools inhealthcare, this encoder plays a foundational role in enablingAl models to perform complex tasks that require a nuancedunderstanding of diverse inputs.\n2) Feature Fusion Mechanism: The heart of a multimodalmodel is its ability to integrate features from different modal-ities. This integration can occur at various stages [37], [38]:\nEarly Fusion: Combines input data at the initial stage,leveraging the raw interconnectedness of different modalities.\nIntermediate Fusion: Merges features during the featureextraction phase, allowing each modality to contribute itsunique properties to a unified representation.\nLate Fusion: Integrates the final outputs from individualmodal pathways at the decision stage, often used in tasksrequiring consolidated judgments from multiple data types.\nJoint Fusion: A hybrid approach that merges early, inter-mediate, and late fusions to maximize data utilization acrossall stages. These fusion processes often employ pre-trainedLLMs, which, while initially designed for textual data, areadapted to handle and synthesize multimodal inputs throughadvanced feature projection and serialization techniques.\nMultimodal Output Decoder: Lastly, the multimodal out-put decoder reconverts the fused, integrated multimodal in-formation back into a usable form tailored to specific tasks,such as Image captioning, the decoder might generate de-scriptive text based on visual inputs. Video understandingtasks, it could produce annotations or summaries combiningboth visual and auditory data. Each decoder is meticulouslydesigned to optimize accuracy and quality, ensuring that theoutput precisely reflects the combined insights gained fromthe integrated modalities.\nTo summarize, the sophisticated architecture of multimodallarge language models empowers them to tackle complex tasksby harnessing and synthesizing data across text, images, andaudio. This capability not only enhances the performance ofAI applications but also opens up new avenues for innovationin how we understand and interact with technology."}, {"title": "C. Overview of Multimodal Feature in LLMs", "content": "When fusing multimodal features, it is common practicenot to train new models from scratch. Instead, existing pre-trained large models, such as LLMs, are utilized. Althoughpre-trained LLMs are primarily designed to handle text input,various techniques can be employed to adapt these modelsfor processing multimodal data. We will introduce a specificexample in this section to illustrate the fusion process andunderstand it in detail.\nFirst, data from each modality needs to be encoded andprojected into a unified feature space. For instance, pre-trainedmodels like ResNet or Vision Transformer can be used toconvert image data into feature vectors \\(V_{image}\\). Text data canbe converted into feature vectors \\(V_{text}\\) using pre-trained textencoders like BERT [39], and audio data can be transformedinto feature vectors \\(V_{audio}\\) using pre-trained audio encoderslike wav2vec [40]. Then, the feature vectors from differentmodalities are mapped into a shared feature space throughlinear transformations or other projection methods. To inputthese multimodal features into a pre-trained LLM, the featuresfrom different modalities need to be organized into a sequence.A multimodal feature sequence can be formed by simplyconcatenating the features from different modalities, such as[\\(V_{image}\\), \\(V_{text}\\), ..., \\(V_{audio}\\), \\(V_{text}\\)].\nNext, the constructed multimodal feature sequence is fedinto the pre-trained LLM for processing. The Transformermodel processes the input feature sequence through multiplelayers of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neuralnetworks. Each layer, comprising self-attention and feedforward network modules, updates and integrates the featurerepresentations, progressively extracting higher-level features.\nAfter passing through multiple Transformer layers, the modelgenerates a feature representation sequence that encapsulatescomprehensive information. Depending on the task require-ments, a specific output layer can generate the final result.For instance, if the task is to generate a textual description,the integrated feature representation can be fed into a textgenerator to produce descriptive text.\nBy following these steps, multimodal features can be effec-tively processed by an LLM. Although pre-trained languagemodels like GPT, LLAMA are primarily designed for textinput, their capabilities can be extended to handle and integratemultimodal data through feature projection and serializationmethods, enabling them to perform complex multimodal tasks."}, {"title": "III.

In this work, we critically assess the impact of satellite failures on constellation performance and the associated task requirements. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a system modeling approach for GPS satellite constellations, enabling an investigation into performance dynamics and task distribution strategies, particularly in scenarios where satellite failures occur during mission-critical operations. Additionally, we introduce reinforcement learning (RL) techniques-specifically Q-learning, Policy Gradient, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-for managing satellite constellations, addressing the challenges posed by reconfiguration and retasking following satellite failures. Our results demonstrate that DQN and PPO achieve effective outcomes in terms of average rewards, task completion rates, and response times.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The emergence of satellite constellations has ushered in a new era in space communications, science, and technology [1], [2]. Comprising numerous satellites operating in coordination, these constellations have broadened the horizons for military and civilian applications. They enable an unparalleled scale and diversity of operations, from defense to civilian domains such as telecommunications, navigation, and earth observation. As these applications have become widespread, modern society has grown increasingly dependent on satellite infrastructure for tasks like meteorological forecasting, broadband connectivity, and more [3]. However, as the number and complexity of satellite missions have grown, so too have the challenges linked to their management. A pressing concern that has recently emerged involves satellites' premature failure or reduced functionality. These malfunctions can be caused by internal issues, such as excessive energy consumption, or external threats, including adversarial attacks. Such complications can render satellites non-operational, leading to gaps in the coverage and services they were designed to provide [4].\nAccording to various studies, despite the rapid advancement in the development of satellite constellations, they face a range of specialized challenges. These challenges include specific orbital arrangements [5], high levels of satellite mobility [6], a vast number of satellites or gateways, resource constraints [7], and issues related to security and reliability [8]. Furthermore, reconfiguration and retasking challenges are of significant concern. Retasking satellites, involving the reallocation or reconfiguration of their functions, is crucial in dynamic space operations. This practice is essential for various reasons, such as accommodating evolving user needs. For example, an Earth observation satellite might shift its focus to respond to a sudden natural disaster [9]. This adaptability also ensures the optimal utilization of onboard resources, such as sensors and bandwidth. Furthermore, if a satellite's primary system fails, retasking can extend the lifespan of its remaining functionalities. The unpredictable nature of space, with challenges like space debris or adverse space weather, may necessitate immediate satellite adjustments [10]. As technological advancements unfold, satellites can be retasked by harnessing new techniques or capabilities not originally envisaged. From an economic standpoint, repurposing a satellite often proves more cost-effective than launching a new one [11]. In addition, strategic defense imperatives may necessitate the rapid repurposing of satellites to meet emerging reconnaissance or communication needs [12]. Components can be reallocated to less demanding roles as they near the end of their lifespan or degrade due to adversarial actions [13]. In multi-satellite constellations, retasking is critical; non-operational satellites can be replaced by repurposing others to ensure mission continuity [14].\nRecently, several techniques have been introduced to address the challenges of satellite retasking, focusing on recon- figuring satellites either directly within their constellations or through ground stations on Earth. In this context, the authors in [15] studied the autonomous reconfiguration of SAR satellite formations using continuous control to tackle the challenge of reconfiguring a satellite cluster during its formation. The study in [16] investigated multi-objective optimization for constellation reconfiguration. It highlights an adaptive multi- objective evolutionary algorithm designed for complex, high-"}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODELING AND PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "The development of a system model for a constellation of GPS satellites involves several key parameters and functions to manage reconfiguration and retasking in the event of satellite failures. Satellite constellations orbit the Earth in elliptical paths, with their motion described by Keplerian orbital elements. Each satellite i in the constellation is characterized by a state vector Si that includes its position (Xi, yi, zi), velocity (vxi, Vy\u2081, Vz\u2081), operational status oi, energy level ei, and task load Ti. The operational status oi is binary, indicating whether the satellite is operational '1' or failed '0'. The failure probability pi can be modeled as a function of time and environmental factors, impacting the satellite's operational status. Communication systems in satellite constellations are crucial for coordinating tasks, transmitting data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the satellite constellation. Each satellite must maintain communication with both other satellites in the constellation and ground stations. Key communication parameters include bandwidth Bij between satellites i and j, operating frequency fij, and modulation scheme mij. Task distribution, a crucial component of the model, involves redistributing the total task load Ttotal among the remaining operational satellites 0. When a satellite j fails, its tasks Tj are redistributed among the remaining operational satellites. The task redistribution is given by $T = T_{i} + \\frac{T_{j}}{O}$ for all i in 0. Reconfiguration and retasking are performed when a satellite fails, involving recalculating positions and adjusting tasks. The new positions and velocities of the satellites are updated using equations of motion over a time interval \u0394t. For position updates: $x_{i}(t + \\Delta t) = x_{i}(t) + v_{x_{i}}(t)\\Delta t$, and for velocity updates considering possible thrust adjustments: $v_{x_{i}} (t + \\Delta t) = v_{x_{i}}(t)+a_{x_{i}} (t)\\Delta t$.\nPerformance metrics are crucial for evaluating the satel- lite constellation. The Task Completion Rate (TCR) is a percentage-based measure that assesses how effectively a satellite constellation completes its assigned tasks. A higher TCR signifies efficient task execution, while a lower rate may indicate inefficiencies or issues within the satellite constellation. It is calculated as:\n$TCR = \\frac{Initial tasks - Remaining tasks}{Initial tasks} \\times 100$ (1)\nThe Average Response Time (ART) measures the system's responsiveness during satellite failures. ART quantifies the average time required to detect a satellite failure, retask, and reconfigure the remaining operational satellites to handle the tasks previously managed by the failed satellite. This includes the entire process from detecting the satellite failure to successfully redistributing the tasks among the remaining satellites. A lower ART indicates a more responsive and adaptable system, capable of quickly adjusting to failures and maintaining operational efficiency. Conversely, a higher ART suggests potential delays and inefficiencies in the retasking and reconfiguration processes. ART is defined as (2).\n$ART = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} t_{i}}{N}$ (2)\nwhere ti is the response time for the i-th satellite failure (the time taken to detect the failure and complete the reconfiguration and retasking) and N is the total number of satellite failures.\nThe optimization problems in this context focus on maximizing the TCR and minimizing the ART. Specifically, the optimization problems can be formulated as follows, with their corresponding constraints:"}, {"title": "III. RL-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR RETASKING AND RECONFIGURATION IN SATELLITE CONSTELLATION", "content": "This section describes the constellation environment and the RL models used to develop learning strategies for satellite reconfiguration and retasking within satellite constellations. The Algorithm 1 outlines the operation of a satellite constel- lation environment, typically used for satellite reconfiguration and retasking in mission-critical applications. It begins by initializing parameters such as the number of satellites N, the number of rounds R, the action space, the observation space, the bandwidth matrix B, the frequency matrix F, the failure probability p, and an episode counter. In mission- critical applications, the probability p of satellite failures is assumed to be higher due to the increased operational demands and the harsh conditions that these satellites often encounter. The initialize_satellites() function sets up each satellite's properties and calculates their initial orbital positions. These properties include task load, maximum capacity, energy level, bandwidth capacity, frequency modulation, status, and reliability. The reset() function resets the environment for a new episode. It sets the current round to 0, restores properties of non-failed satellites, redistributes tasks from failed satellites and adjusts parameters based on the episode count. For example, if the episode counter is greater than or equal to 100, the failure probability is increased. The calculate_distance() function computes the Euclidean distance between two satellites based on their positions. This distance calculation is essential for determining various aspects of satellite communication and task execution. The step(action) function is the core of the algorithm, facilitating interaction between the environment and an agent. It parses the action into source and destination satellites, checks for validity, calculates parameters such as distance, delay, bandwidth, and frequency modulation, and executes the action. The function also handles penalties and rewards and manages responses to satellite failures. If a satellite fails, tasks are redistributed among operational satellites, and the constellation is reconfigured to ensure continued operation. Finally, the function updates metrics and returns the new state, reward, and a flag indicating whether the episode is done. In Algorithm 2, the selected RL models, including Q-learning, Policy Gradient, DQN, and PPO, are integrated into a satellite constellation environment to enhance the average reward, TCR, and ART. The algorithm begins by initializing key parameters, including the number of satellites, rounds, action, observation spaces, and the episode counter. For each RL model, the essential components are set up: the Q-table for Q-learning, the policy network for the Policy Gradient method, the neural network (NN) for the DQN, and the policy network for PPO. The process involves several key functions:"}, {"title": "IV.

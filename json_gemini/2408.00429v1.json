INTRODUCTION", "content": "The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has suc-cessfully conducted the fifth generation (5G) Advanced phase in its Release 18 [1]. As one of the most significant poten-tial advancements to increase automation and efficiency of the industrial domain, the indoor positioning has attracted widespread attention. However, the indoor factory scenario presents challenges, including a high volume of obstruc-tions leading to numerous non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. These conditions often lead to significant performance degra-dation for the traditional positioning algorithms [2], [3].\nTo address the issue of the limitations and difficulties of traditional positioning methods, a notable point is to inte-grate deep learning (DL) into indoor positioning systems, specifically fingerprint-based positioning. The basic idea of the fingerprint positioning is to create a mapping function between the channel measurements and the position coor-dinates, creating a main wireless radio environment among the transceivers [4]. Then, the user equipment (UE) can obtain its position by the measurements. The measurements of fingerprint positioning in the cellular systems are mainly channel impulse response (CIR), power delay profile (PDP), and so on [5]. However, DL-based indoor positioning faces the challenge of insufficient data available for training the model [6]. Especially, in the flexible and dynamic communication systems, obtaining sufficient measurements and labeling them is a labor-intensive and resource-consuming task.\nA powerful approach termed semi-supervised learning (SSL) was proposed, which involved using small number of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data to train the model [7]-[9]. Typical SSL [10] may lead to serious performance degradation due to errors in the pseudo-labels of the unlabeled data. To address this issue, a smaller weighting coefficient was added to the unlabeled data during model training [11]. The weighting coefficient is a hyperparameter, which requires meticulous manual tuning. In [12], the concept of confidence for the pseudo-label of the unlabeled data was proposed, which helps to select reliable unlabeled data in classification tasks. However, there is a lack of a method to define a label confidence in regression tasks like positioning. Furthermore, in an indoor scenario, obtaining the unlabeled data is also a challenge that requires extra measurement overhead.\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, a DL-based posi-tioning algorithm with reduced overhead is proposed. To lower the measurement overhead, the unlabeled data is generated by an updated channel simulator according to the stochastic parameters of the labeled data. This approach reduces the measurement expenses of the unlabeled data. Additionally, to capture the features of both the labeled and unlabeled channel data, a semi-supervised learning with a biased teacher is proposed. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 An updated channel simulator is utilized to generate un-labeled data, thereby reducing the measurement expenses associated with acquiring such data. Initially, labeled data collected within an indoor factory environment is utilized, and the primary channel parameters are ana-lyzed to extract the channel stochastic parameters of the measurement environment. Subsequently, the typical TR 38.901 [13] channel simulator is updated with these stochastic parameters, resulting in the creation of an updated channel simulator (UCHS). The UCHS is then employed to simulate the unlabeled channel data, which closely resembles the labeled data of the measurement environment.\n\u2022 To efficiently capture the mapping function between the CIR and the position coordinate while minimizing training expenses, a SSL with a biased teacher (SSLB) is introduced. The SSLB approach involves weighting the unlabeled data based on the confidence, which is derived"}, {"title": "II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "content": "A. Adapting semi-supervised learning for indoor positioning\nThe dataset of traditional SSL consists of two parts: the labeled dataset and the unlabeled dataset. The input is the CIR and the output is the predicted position. The labeled dataset is represented as $D(H,I)$, where $H$ is the labeled CIR and $I$ is its corresponding position coordinate. The unlabeled dataset is represented as $E(H^*)$, containing only the CIR.\nThe SSL model is divided into a teacher model $\\Theta^t$ and a student model $\\Theta^s$. Firstly, the teacher model is trained with labeled data, and then pseudo-labels of unlabeled data are generated using the trained teacher model. Finally, the student model is trained with both the labeled data and the unlabeled data. In this paper, the loss function is defined as the Euclidean distance between the predicted position and the real position as shown in (1). First, train the teacher model using this loss on the labeled dataset $D(H, I)$.\n$L = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N ||l_i - \\hat{l_i}||^2$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(1)\nThen, the label of dataset $E(H^*)$ is generated with the trained teacher model\n$l^* = f(H^*, \\Theta^t)$,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(2)\nwhere $l^*$ is the position coordinate of $H^*$. $f(.)$ represents the mapping function between the channel measurements and position coordinates. In this way, the dataset $E(H^*)$ is completed to $E(H^*, l^*)$. Finally, the student model is trained with the dataset of $D(H, I)$ and $E(H^*, l^*)$, applying weights to pseudo-labeled data. The loss function is defined as follows:\n$L_w = \\frac{1}{N+N^*} (\\sum_{i=1}^N ||l_i - \\hat{l_i}||^2 + \\sum_{j=1}^{N^*} w^*_j ||l^*_j - \\hat{l^*_j}||^2)$,\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(3)\nwhere $L_w$ is the loss of weighted semi-supervised algorithm, $N$ and $N^*$ are the numbers of labeled data and unlabeled data, and $w$ and $w^*$ are the corresponding weights of labeled data"}, {"title": "III. CHANNEL FEATURE AIDED DATA AUGMENTATION", "content": "A. Wireless channel feature extracting method\nIn this section, some specific methods for extracting channel parameters will be described.\n1) Angle spread: The angle spread (AS) is used to charac-terize the dispersion features of the multipaths in the spatial domain. Initially, a two-dimensional Discrete Fourier trans-form (DFT) is performed over the channel matrix $H(t)$ over the port domain, resulting in the angle domain channel matrix $H_{ang}$ [13] as follows:\n$H_{ang} = U^T H(t) V,$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(4)\nwhere $U = [u_1; ...; u_M]^T$ is the transmit DFT matrix, and $V = [v_1, ..., v_{M_r}]$ is the receiver DFT matrix [14].\nThen, the receiving and transmitting AS are illustrated in the spatial domain. The angle spread value can be obtained as follows:\n$\\sigma_{AS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^M \\Theta_m^2 P_m}{\\sum_{m=1}^M P_m} - (\\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^M \\Theta_m P_m}{\\sum_{m=1}^M P_m})^2} ,$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(5)\nwhere $P_m$ is the power of the $m$th multipath, $\\Theta_m$ is the angle of the $m$th multipath.\n2) Delay spread: The delay spread (DS) can reflect the richness of the channel multipaths. And the DS [15] can be obtained as follows:\n$\\sigma_{DS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^M (\\tau_m - \\tau_{mean})^2 P_m}{\\sum_{m=1}^M P_m}} ,$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(6)\nwhere $\\tau_{mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^M (\\tau_m P_m)}{\\sum_{m=1}^M (P_m)}$ is the mean delay."}, {"title": "B. Unlabeled data generation via UCHS", "content": "The TR 38.901 [13], considered as the state-of-the-art 3GPP channel model, is crucial for generating channel simulation data and evaluating physical layer techniques. It illustrates the stochastic distribution characteristics of channel multipaths, serving as a benchmark in a general scenario. However, in a specific location, the channel parameters in TR 38.901 may not be precise. Regrettably, in an AI-enabled indoor factory, the training data needs to reflect the actual propagation environment as accurately as possible.\nTo address the aforementioned issue, we propose a data augmentation method based on the channel simulator, which can simulate the unlabeled channel data corresponding to the specific area. This approach significantly reduces the collection overhead of unlabeled data. The generation process of unlabeled data is shown as follows:\n\u2022 Step 1: the labeled channel data is collected by the UEs distributed in a specific indoor factory. Since labeled data is essential for training the teacher model, there is no extra overhead of data collection at this stage.\n\u2022 Step 2: upload the labeled data from the UE to the BS.\n\u2022 Step 3: the primary statistical parameters of the channel data are extracted, as described in Section III-A, effec-tively depicting the wireless propagation environment.\n\u2022 Step 4: these statistical parameters are used to update the parameters of typical TR 38.901 channel model, resulting in the UCHS.\n\u2022 Step 5: the UCHS is used to simulate unlabeled channel data similar to the labeled data of the measurement environment."}, {"title": "IV. SEMI-SUPERVISED PSEUDO-LABELING WITH A BIASED TEACHER", "content": "Compared to traditional SSLs, our proposed method assigns different loss weights to the pseudo-labels of the unlabeled data based on the confidence scores. By doing so, pseudo-labels with low confidence are assigned small weights during the training stage of the student model, thereby mitigating the impact of pseudo-labels with large offset on the performance of the student model.\nThe proposed method pipeline, as illustrated in Fig. 2, consists of three primary stages: the bias teacher training stage, the confidence-based pseudo-labeling stage, and the weighted loss student training stage:\n\u2022 Stage 1: an additional reference signal and a position bias are separately added to the input and output of the traditional SSL model. This addition helps extract additional information from the labeled dataset. Specifically, the position bias represents the distance between the input signal and its nearest signal, referred to as the reference signal. This allows the teacher model to not only determine the mapping function between the input signal and the position coordinates but also to assess the similarity between input signals using the distance bias.\n\u2022 Stage 2: the trained teacher model is utilized to generate pseudo-labels and the position bias of the unlabeled data. The position bias can then be used to define the confidence scores of the unlabeled data through a kernel density estimation (KDE) [16] function.\n\u2022 Stage 3: a weighted loss strategy is employed, wherein different loss weights are assigned to different pseudo-labels in the loss function to train the student model. This approach aims to mitigate the impact of pseudo-labels with larger errors on the performance of the student model."}, {"title": "A. The biased teacher training", "content": "In the context of object detection, models not only output the bounding boxes of the detected objects but also provide confidence scores for these detections. Inspired by this, a biased teacher model with two prediction heads is proposed. One prediction head, called the 'predict head\", is responsible for predicting the position coordinates l corresponding to the input CIR. The other prediction head, named as the \"biased head\" is designed to predict the bias $\\Delta l$ of the reference signal relative to the input CIR position.\nThe first step involves using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) [17] algorithm to search the reference signal $H_{ref}$ in labeled dataset $D(H,I)$ that is closest to the input CIR $H_i$, thereby obtaining the reference signal data pair $(H_{ref}, l_{ref})$, i.e.,\n$H_{ref} = H_j, arg \\min_{j \\in (1,2,...,N)} ||H_i - H_j ||_F, i \\neq j,$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(7)\nwhere $||\\cdot||_F$ is Frobenius norm, and $i \\neq j$ excludes itself as the nearest neighbor.\nThe position bias is defined as:\n$\\Delta l_i = l_{ref} - l_i$.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(8)\nThe total loss function of the teacher model is defined as:\n$L = L_p + L_b,$\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(9)\nwhere $L_P = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N ||l_i - \\hat{l_i}||$ and $L_b = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N ||\\Delta l_i - \\hat{\\Delta l_i}||$ are the position prediction loss and the bias prediction loss, respectively.\""}, {"title": "B.

Our method aims to provide a convenient guideline for adaptively obtaining the weight of the unlabeled data using confidence. This is compatible with consistency-based pseudo-labeling SSL [12], [18]-[20], and combining them may lead to better results, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.\nFig. 4 illustrates the positioning accuracy for the four schemes with different labeled samples. It is evident that the SSLB achieves the highest positioning precision. For instance, with less than 6300 samples, SSLB can achieve the precision of 0.897 m, while the SL requires 9900 samples to achieve a precision of 0.969 m. Therefore, with the help of UCHS, our proposed SSLB can reduce the data overhead by almost 40% compared to SL. However, it is worth noting that the performance of the SSL pseudo-label method degrades at 2700 samples, due to the introduction of enormous inaccurate pseudo-labels by the teacher model, which deteriorates the performance of the student model. In contrast, SSLB achieves relatively stable performance, as it can automatically assign small weights to the unlabeled data with large offset.\n2) Ablation study:\na) The impact of weight on the test loss: In this section, we study the effects of weight magnitude a on the SSLR and our proposed SSLB.

As the scaling coefficient decreases, the performance gap between the two schemes reduces, whereas the SSLB outperforms the SSLR in all cases.

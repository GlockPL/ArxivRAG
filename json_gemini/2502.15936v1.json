However, since NTNs are currently operated independently, they face challenges such as isolation, limited scalability, and high operational costs. Integrating satellite constellations with terrestrial networks offers a way to address these limitations while enabling adaptive and cost-efficient connectivity through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This paper introduces Space-O-RAN, a framework that extends Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles to NTNs. It employs hierarchical closed-loop control with distributed Space RAN Intelligent Controllers (Space-RICs) to dynamically manage and optimize operations across both domains. To enable adaptive resource allocation and network orchestration, the proposed architecture integrates real-time satellite optimization and control with Al-driven management and Digital Twin (DT) modeling. It incorporates distributed Space Applications (sApps) and distributed applications (dApps) to ensure robust performance in highly dynamic orbital environments. A core feature is dynamic link-interface mapping, which allows network functions to adapt to specific application requirements and changing link conditions using all physical links on the satellite. Simulation results evaluate its feasibility by analyzing latency constraints across different NTN link types, demonstrating that intra-cluster coordination operates within viable signaling delay bounds, while offloading non-real-time tasks to ground infrastructure enhances scalability toward Sixth-Generation (6G) networks.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The demand for high-capacity, globally available connec-tivity has positioned Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) as a key element of next-generation communication systems. These networks-including Low-Earth Orbits (LEOs), Medium Earth Orbits (MEOs), Geostationary Orbits (GEOs), High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), and deep-space platforms-extend cover-age to remote regions, addressing the limitations of terrestrial infrastructure. Recent advancements in satellite constellations, such as Starlink by SpaceX and Project Kuiper by Amazon, illustrate their potential to improve connectivity worldwide [1], [2]. While terrestrial and NTNs are still managed separately, there is a growing trend toward their complementary use [1]. However, standalone and closed NTN systems face fun-damental limitations due to their isolated operation, reliance on dedicated feeder link infrastructure, high operational costs, and constrained optimization capabilities. Integrating NTNs with terrestrial networks operating in the same spectrum and interference domains can transform these systems from siloed architectures into unified, efficient, and resilient networks. This convergence enables adaptive resource management and enhanced scalability, making NTNs better suited to address the complex demands of emerging 6G applications [1], [2]. Moreover, the integration introduces significant improve-ments in network resiliency and adaptability. Jointly managed networks could autonomously deploy NTN backhaul cells in disaster recovery and ad hoc communication scenarios, ensuring uninterrupted service when terrestrial infrastructure is compromised. Dynamic traffic monitoring within terrestrial networks enables real-time load balancing, optimizing re-source allocation across NTN and terrestrial domains based on contextual demands. Hierarchical closed-loop control mecha-nisms can facilitate unified network management, improving spectrum efficiency, minimizing interference, and enabling seamless traffic offloading between orbital and terrestrial segments. Furthermore, integrated architectures can unlock advanced use cases, such as distributed computing frameworks spanning terrestrial and space domains. The unified manage-ment of all on-board radio links and user-plane resources enables the deployment of virtualized network functions and other computational workloads, dynamically adapting to traffic fluctuations and processing demands. Achieving cohesive coordination presents significant techni-cal challenges because of differences in operational character-istics and resource constraints [2]. Unlike terrestrial systems, NTNs operate in highly dynamic and resource-constrained environments. For example, the continuous movement of LEOs satellites necessitates frequent handovers and real-time connectivity updates. These dynamics introduce time-varying latency, intermittent connectivity, and frequent Line-Of-Sight (LOS) disruption, impacting service continuity and network stability [3]. Additionally, onboard limitations in power, com-putational resources, and thermal management constrain the deployment of advanced optimization algorithms, emphasizing the need for efficient task offloading strategies [4]. The absence of standardized coordination protocols between the orbital and terrestrial layers further exacerbates these challenges, leading to fragmented operations, inefficient resource allocation, and increased interference risks in shared or adjacent spectrum bands [5]. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Space-O-RAN, a novel architectural framework for the integrated con-trol and optimization of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Built on Open RAN principles, Space-O-RAN incorporates (i) programmability through software-based protocol stacks, (ii) open interfaces for seamless cross-domain coordination,"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "Existing integrated terrestrial-NTN architectures, such as Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) [6], focus primarily on user-plane solutions and lack closed-loop con-trol mechanisms. While SAGIN envisions seamless NTN-terrestrial integration, its practical implementation remains limited by dynamic link variability, intermittent connectivity, and latency constraints. These factors make efficient real-time control loops difficult to implement, particularly when rely-ing on existing Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches, which struggle with inconsistent data availability and compu-tational constraints. The integration of AI into NTNs faces significant chal-lenges. Limited onboard resources restrict the execution of complex learning algorithms, while intermittent satellite con-nectivity and long propagation delays disrupt data collection, model training, and inference processes. Current solutions often fail to address real-time resource allocation, adaptive control, and precise timing synchronization, leaving interoper-ability between orbital and terrestrial layers largely conceptual, with no standardized implementations for protocol or interface alignment [7]. Recent research on NTN-terrestrial integration has identified key trade-offs in Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures. Lower-layer functional splits reduce latency but impose strict timing constraints that are difficult to meet in high-latency NTN environments. Centralized architectures, while easier to implement, introduce bandwidth inefficiencies over feeder links [8]. Modular architectures that leverage standardized interfaces, such as near-RT and non-RT RAN Intelligent Con-trollers (RICs), show potential for adaptive resource manage-ment and real-time control. However, they remain constrained by scalability issues, high latency, and the complexity of ensuring seamless handovers between satellite clusters [9]. Addressing these limitations requires innovations that balance distributed decision-making, adaptive resource allocation, and efficient multi-domain integration. On the industry side, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has made significant progress in interoperability with NTN. Release 17 introduced extensions to Fifth-Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) for direct-to-device satellite connectiv-ity, while Release 18 builds on these enhancements with dy-namic handovers and spectrum sharing. ITU-T Y.3207 (2024) defines INCA for Fixed, Mobile, and Satellite Convergence (FMSC), proposing a centralized control framework, but its feasibility in dynamic NTN environments remains uncertain due to latency, overhead, and computational constraints. These developments provide a foundation for integration, but remain insufficient without additional architectural enhancements to address specific constraints in NTN, such as real-time coordi-nation, cross-layer control, and resource-aware AI processing."}, {"title": "III. CHALLENGES AND USE CASES", "content": "This section identifies the key challenges in integrating optimization and control for terrestrial and NTNs, highlighting the technical and operational barriers to seamless coordination.\nDynamic Topologies and Fragmented Control. The con-stant mobility of LEOs and MEOs satellites necessitates fre-quent handovers and dynamic network reconfiguration. These conditions introduce time-varying latency, intermittent con-nectivity, and LOS disruptions due to environmental factors and orbital motion. For example, GEOs experience round-trip delays exceeding 240 ms, while Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) exhibit variable latencies depending on orbital alignment. Such dynamics demand mechanisms for localized adaptation to ensure service continuity while maintaining coherence with global directives [4]. Section IV-B further examines latency boundaries and their implications for real-time operations.\nInteroperability and Standardization. The absence of uni-fied protocols for coordinating terrestrial and satellite systems presents a significant barrier to seamless integration. While theoretical frameworks have proposed conceptual models, practical mechanisms for signaling, closed-loop control, and cross-domain communication are still in their early stages of development. The lack of standardized interfaces and synchronization protocols leads to operational fragmentation, complicating interoperability across a diverse supply chain [5], [10].\nSpectrum Management and Coexistence. The shared use of spectrum across terrestrial and NTNs poses significant chal-lenges for coexistence and interference mitigation. Feasibility studies for Ka, Ku, and S bands have demonstrated potential, but the real-time allocation of spectrum and mitigation of interference between constellations require sophisticated co-ordination strategies. The increasing number of constellations and the growing demand for bandwidth underscore the urgency of developing mechanisms to maximize spectral efficiency while avoiding service disruption [11].\nSecurity and Operational Reliability. The expanded attack surface introduced by the integration of terrestrial and satellite"}, {"title": "A. Use Cases", "content": "The following examples highlight how addressing critical integration challenges will support advanced applications.\nRural and Localized Networks. Deploying localized net-works in remote or underserved areas demands flexible re-source allocation and low-latency communication. Standalone NTNs often struggle to meet these requirements due to limited adaptability. Integrated architectures address these limitations by enabling terrestrial base stations to act as ground stations, efficiently managing spectrum and resources across both ter-restrial and non-terrestrial areas, removing the reliance on specific feeder links.\nIn rural regions, where the deployment and maintenance of terrestrial infrastructure is prohibitively expensive, NTNs can provide high-speed broadband backhaul to existing base stations. By serving multiple regions globally, NTNs distribute deployment costs across a vast user base, significantly reduc-ing the financial burden on local communities compared to es-tablishing fixed terrestrial networks. During tactical operations, integrated systems can ensure seamless service delivery by prioritizing low-latency command-and-control communication via terrestrial nodes, while leveraging NTNs for robust data aggregation and high-latency bulk transmission. This dual capability supports critical applications without relying on pre-existing terrestrial infrastructure.\nAutonomous Disaster Response. In disaster scenarios where the terrestrial infrastructure is severely disrupted or destroyed, integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial systems can ensure the continuity of communication. Using ISLs for backhaul and dynamic routing of traffic through unaffected terrestrial nodes, these systems enable real-time situational awareness, emergency coordination, and remote command-and-control. For example, a satellite-enabled backhaul can restore connectivity by dynamically allocating bandwidth to the affected region while prioritizing critical traffic, such as video feeds for search-and-rescue operations. Additionally, real-time telemetry from NTNs enhances decision-making by complementing terrestrial sensing capabilities.\nUbiquitous AI-Driven Applications. Satellites provide un-matched global coverage for data collection, but face sig-nificant limitations in on-board storage, processing power,"}, {"title": "IV. PROPOSED SOLUTION: SPACE-O-RAN", "content": "The Space-O-RAN architecture integrates terrestrial and NTNs, addressing key challenges such as dynamic conn\u0435\u0441-tivity, resource constraints, and scalability. By applying open RAN principles and standardized interfaces, the architecture ensures seamless interaction between terrestrial and non-terrestrial segments. To efficiently manage satellite operations within a large constellation, we adopt a clustering approach [13]. Satellites are grouped based on orbital proximity, reducing system-wide signaling overhead and enabling localized decision-making. Instead of requiring continuous coordination across the en-tire constellation, each cluster autonomously optimizes its resources while maintaining alignment with broader network objectives. This decentralized approach enhances adaptability to dynamic topology changes and intermittent connectivity. The architecture consists of two main domains: space-based and ground-based components (see Fig. 1). The onboard AI-enabled edge network, optimized for resource-constrained en-vironments, hosts modular network elements such as Satellite Distributed Units (s-DUs) and Satellite Central Units (s-CUs). At the core of this system is the Space-RIC, a near-real-time RIC responsible for cluster-wide coordination and real-time adaptation. Unlike dApps, which directly interact with individual RAN functions, the Space-RIC orchestrates intra-cluster decision-making, managing inter-satellite handovers,"}, {"title": "A.

The strategic"}, {"title": "B. Feasibility Bounds", "content": "The feasibility of Space-O-RAN is evaluated by examining the latency characteristics of NTNs and their implications for the hierarchical control framework. Simulations of the Starlink constellation, comprising 6545 satellites and 33 ground gate-ways, provide latency insights critical for aligning real-time and non real-time operations. Due to the Starlink constellation design and density, each satellite has a consistent number of available ISLs below 10 ms delays (Fig. 2b), offering a reliable foundation for real-time tasks. Conversely, due to the LEO satellite rapid motion, the GSLs delay exceeds 10 ms for 80% of the possible elevation angles (Fig. 2a). More of half of the satellites visible from the ground experience a propagation delay above 40 ms, which limits their suitability for real-time operations but makes them viable for strategic, non-critical tasks like policy updates and long-term resource allocation. This latency stratification aligns with the functional split strategy, as previously described. Real-time, latency-sensitive decisions are localized to the operational and coordination levels, using ISLs for immediate adjustments and intra-cluster communication. Computationally intensive tasks, which can tolerate higher delays, are offloaded to the terrestrial cloud via GSLs, ensuring efficient utilization of satellite and terrestrial resources. The analysis also highlights critical trade-offs in the inte-gration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Meanwhile reducing on-board processing delays can improve responsive-ness, it places greater reliance on ISLs for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication. Conversely, centralized cloud-based processing risks overloading GSLs, reducing spectral efficiency and introducing bottlenecks. The proposed hybrid approach mitigates these trade-offs by combining localized real-time decision-making at the cluster level with scalable computational resources in the terrestrial cloud."}, {"title": "C. SpaceRIC and Hierarchical Coordination of r/s/dApps", "content": "The Space-RIC, illustrated in Fig. 3, extends the O-RAN RIC framework to satellite clusters, integrating global policies from terrestrial rApps with real-time operations in space. Unlike terrestrial RICs, which rely on stable infrastructure, Space-RIC is designed for decentralized control, enabling satellites to adapt dynamically to topology changes, intermit-tent connectivity, and constrained computational resources. Each satellite runs an instance of Space-RIC, but coordi-nation follows a Leader-Follower model to optimize system-wide efficiency. The Leader interfaces with terrestrial non-RT RIC, receiving policies via Al and O1, processing real-time telemetry from O-RAN Near-Real-Time Interface (E2), and issuing intra-cluster control commands. It dynamically manages inter-satellite handovers, spectrum allocation, and resource scheduling, ensuring local adaptations align with global directives. Followers execute Leader's control decisions via dApps, handling near-real-time tasks such as beam adjustments, mod-ulation selection, and power control. To enhance resilience, all satellites maintain active but passive Coord sApp, continuously synchronizing state information. If the Leader fails or loses connectivity, the Federated O-RAN Near-Real-Time Interface (FED-E2) protocol triggers an autonomous re-election, se-lecting the most suitable Follower based on link stability, computational capacity, and telemetry quality. Since Followers remain pre-synchronized, the transition occurs seamlessly with minimal service disruption. sApps in Space-RIC optimize cluster-wide decision making similar to terrestrial xApps, but are designed for in-orbit execution. These applications operate in a fully distributed manner, synchronizing state updates via inter-satellite links (ISLs) to prevent conflicts in resource allocation. The Leader enables these processes while avoiding a single point of fail-ure, maintaining distributed control if it becomes unavailable"}, {"title": "D. Dynamic Link-Interface Mapping", "content": "Dynamic link-interface mapping is a cornerstone of the architecture, addressing challenges in spectrum management and resource prioritization by enabling the adaptive assignment of O-RAN interfaces to specific link roles based on real-time network conditions. This flexibility is critical in the On-Board Compute-AI-Network Edge, where varying connectivity needs and diverse application demands require seamless coordination across network layers. The system maps multiple O-RAN interfaces to a single physical link to support concurrent signaling and user-plane traffic. For example, an ISL can manage both the E2 interface for inter-satellite coordination within the Space-RIC and the F1 interface for communication between the s-CU and the s-DU, ensuring operational continuity across distributed satellite clusters. Similarly, FLs and SLs are dynamically allocated to prioritize critical services, such as emergency response or high-priority Internet of Things (IoT) traffic, using low-latency links like ISLs. Conversely, non-critical bulk data is routed through higher-latency paths, preserving premium resources for time-sensitive operations."}, {"title": "E.

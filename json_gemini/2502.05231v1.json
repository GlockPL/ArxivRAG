{"title": "The thin ring wing as a means of flow improvement\nupstream of a propeller.", "authors": ["Vladimir Sluchak"], "abstract": "There are numerous devices currently known with the purpose to reduce the irregularity of the\nflow upstream of the propeller and to decrease by that means the propeller-induced vibration and\nnoise. Many of these devices are wing-shaped vortex-generators that affect the flow with their\ninduced (i.e. passive) longitudinal vortices. The subject of the paper is the use of a ring-shaped\nwing as a highly effective passive vortex-generator which allows to control the flow closer to the\nmost charged sections of propeller blades. The problem of a thin ring-shaped wing with\nirregular (asymmetric) geometry in the irregular steadyflow has been solved in linear approach\nand the intensity of the induced longitudinal vortices as a function of the irregularity of the flow\nand the geometry of the ring wing has been estimated using that solution. Experiments in the\ntowing tank showing good concordance with the theoretical model confirmed the effectiveness of\nsuch a device. Some additional advantages of a ring-shaped wing incorporated into the\nconstruction of stabilizers are considered.", "sections": [{"title": null, "content": "As the level of a propeller noise often needs\nto be lowered certain kinds of \"flow\nimprovement\" upstream of a propeller make\nsense and is widely used. The currently\nadmitted model of the flow filtration by a\npropeller allows to formulate the following\nflow improvement targets [1]:\nto decrease a high frequency (with\ncontinuos spectrum) component of the\npropeller noise the rough characteristic of the\nflow irregularity forward of the propeller is to\nbe decreased the difference between\nmaximum and minimum of the circular\ndistribution V(o,r) of the velocity at end\nsections of blades;\nto decrease discrete spectrum components\nof the vibration and the revolution sound of the\npropeller it is enough to decrease amplitudes\nand sums of amplitudes [aqz|; [aqz\u00b11];\n[bqz; bqz\u00b11] of harmonics (member of\nthe corresponding Fourier series) of V(o,r)\nat the most charged sections of propeller\nblades. Here: z is the number of propeller\nblades; q digit; a, b - cosine and sine\nharmonic amplitudes.\nThe harmonics with numbers more than z\nare very hard to control because they\npractically never dominate in V(o, r) making\nsome hundredths of A. So the second part of\nthe flow improvement problem is much more\ndelicate then the first one and actually has\nnever been approached effectively enough.\nUsually the revolution sound of the propeller\nis optimized by some expensive way of\npropeller design which in particular implies\nthe increase of blades numbers. The\ndescribed flow improvement problem is\nprincipally solved in two ways: the\noptimization of the vessel architecture (the\nshape and dimensions of hull sail,\nstabilizers, covers etc.) and the usage of\nspecial flow improvement devices (later -\nHID)."}, {"title": null, "content": "For different kinds of vessels (submarines and\nsubmersibles at most) a ring-shaped wing placed\nforward of the propeller around the tale of a hull\npresents a very effective combination of these two ways\nof flow improvement. Such a wing architecturally and\nfunctionally perfectly fits into the tale -plane or\nstabilizers allowing to decrease stabilizers dimensions\ncrucial for the magnitude of A. You may consider\nthe following architecture for a submarine with a\ntraditional pushing propeller as a A-minimizing one:\nan axis - symmetrical hull, no sail, stabilizers as a\nring - shaped wing on relatively narrow pillars (unlike\nconventional cross shaped wing). Such an\narchitecture accepted as an ideal all the real\narchitectural types might be put in some order of\ndeviation from it.\nLet's traverse that architectural sequence trying to keep\nthe same low level of flow irregularity forward of a\npropeller: the more an architecture would deviate from\nthe ideal one (for instance - the larger the sail would be\n) the more flow improving work would be required.\nIncorporating the ring shaped wing within the\narchitecture allows to do that work very effective way.\nThe ring affects the flow by its passively\ngenerated longitudinal vortices. The intensity of an\nelementary vortex running down from the ring is\nproportional to the derivative (vb\u025b)/dq, where v is the\nvelocity of the flow on the front of the ring, b - the\nchord of the ring, \u025b - local angle of attack composed of\na constructive angle of the ring wing and the angle\nbetween the flow direction and the axes of thering. As\nyour can see from that formula the vortex shroud\nrunning down from a ring wing is sensitive to the\nirregularity of the flow upstream: the more intense is\nthe irregularity the greater is the intensity of\ngenerated vortices. The vortices intensity may be\ncontrolled precisely at any sector of the propeller's disk\nwith variation of the ring geometry which the simplest\ncase is circular variation of the chord. The generated\nvortices work aft of the ring in the boundary layer\nother passive vortex - generating FIDs: they induce\ntraversal flows that redistribute the layers with\ndifferent longitudinal velocity (fig.1).\nAssuming the wing be relatively narrow and thin\nand deferring the estimation of limits of such an\nassumption until sometime later, let us represent the\nring wing with one flat circular attached vortex with\ncirculation \u0393(\u03c6) and cylindrical (with radius R) shroud\nof free vortices with intensity (1/R) \u2202\u0413/0\u03c6. The flow\nforward of the ring is considered ideal and given by its\nthree components of the velocity on the front edge of\nthe ring wing. The profile of the wing is considered\nsymmetrical, the distance b/4 from the attached vortex\nto the front edge of the wing small enough to\ndisregard the induction of the attached vortex on the\nfront edge of the ring wing. Within the limits of such\na simple model the equation for the circulation \u0393(\u03c6) is\nderived on the assumption that the Chapligin-Jukovsky\npostulate is met in every meridian section of the ring\nwing.

As we mentioned before it\nimplies the use of a theory of relations between the\n\"outlook\" (the set of some rough characteristics) of\nthe circular distribution of the velocity and its Fourier\nseries.\nHaving observed main features of a RFID we\nmight set the design procedure of such a device as\nfully experimental : sequential adjustments of the ring\ngeometry during model tests in towing tank. But there\nare some design steps that may be pre-calculated at\nleast for axis - symmetrical vessels. These steps are :\n1. The optimization of ratios between the major\ndimensions of a RFID and the local diameter of the\nhull from the condition of maximum induction of\nvortex shroud when moving at an angle of attack.\nTo solve that problem the hull is imitated with a dipole\nin the plane of an attached vortex of a ring wing\nwhich drives the problem down to the equation:\nwhere:\nA(r, b)/or = 0,\n$\\frac{1-(t_0/r)^2}{2\u03bb}$$\nA(r, b) = 1+\\frac{}{\u03c0}$$\n2. The optimization of the dimensions of RFID from\nthe condition of smooth (non separating) flow in\nthe channel formed by a ring and a hull.\nThe limit ratio between in and out sections area is used\nhere:\nSout/Sin = 1.2, that insures the non-separating flow\ninside of a diffuser .\n3.

The ring is devised into segments with angular\ndimensions defined by maximums of the function\n\u04d8\u0413/\u03c6. The empirical formula for the critical angle of\nattack may be used here:\n$\\partial \\Gamma /\\partial \\phi$\nwhere p - the elongation of a segment.\n4. The estimation of the circular variation of the\nchord of a RFID from the condition of a maximum"}, {"title": null, "content": "effect on circular distributions of the velocities on the\ngiven radius of a propeller's disk.\nFormula (9) is accepted for a chord. The axis\nsymmetrical boundary layer is pre-calculated using any\nknown method (for instance - [2]).\nFollowing assumptions are enforced:\na) the cross - shaped symmetrical stabilizers is the sole\nassembly of parts jutting out of the hull\nb) the stabilizers affect the flow only with their head\nvortices,\nc) the threads of head vortices of stabilizers remain in\nmeridian planes laying under angles \u03c6 = \u03c0(2k +1)/8 to\nthe vertical plane.\nThe value of Ab is found from the condition of zero\nshift of the intersection of the given flow line\n(laying in the plane of a stabilizer) with the plane of the\npropeller's disk (fig.1).\nThese calculations allow to draw some diagrams to\nestimate the geometry of a RFID.\nThe final design of an RFID for single shaft submarine\nis to be done on basis of model experiments with RFID.\nAs of two shaft submarines and other non axis\nsymmetrical vessels - the series of experiments with\nstepwise adjustments of the construction is practically\nthe only way to design RFID.\nPassing to the experimental part of the RFID study\nit is difficult to refrain of making the suggestion that a\nsmart incorporation of a ring wing in tail assemblies of\nvessels almost inevitably leads to the decrease of flow\nirregularity and necessarily - propeller noise and\nvibration. The impressive result of such a design is\nobserved on torpedoes with total substitution of cross-\nshaped stabilizers by a ring -shaped wing (fig. 3)\nwhich is obviously the case when the whole flow\nimproving effect comes from placing the main surface\nof stabilizers out of the flow running into the\npropeller's disk. There may by several design solutions\nof that kind proposed in all of which the vortex shroud\nof a ring wing does not play any essential role in flow\nimprovement forward of the propeller.\nAs it has been already noticed experiments with\nRFID are needed not only to test the theory and the\nfinal effect: the main part of the RFID design is\nsupposed to be done as a series of adjustments based\non model tests results. When the substantial decrease\nof the A is achieved and with not too many of\nexperimental adjustments you may want to skip all the\nintermediate estimations and get right to the sound\ncalculation with a high probability of a success. But,\nwhatever be the decrease of the A you are never sure\nthat it leads to the decrease of the particular harmonic\na; unless you have handy someproven formula of the\nkind f\u2081 (A) > f2(a;) (provided as well that Fourier series\nof the initial velocity distribution V(q) have been\nreceived).\nPractically all the controllable characteristics of the\ncircular velocity distributions V(o) at different radii of\nthe propeller are the \u201crough\u201d ones comparing to the\nreal aim of the control - the harmonics of V(\u03c6).\nThe A may be considered as the roughest one, all\nthe others like for instance :\nmaximum derivative of V(o), local extremums,\nor the full deviation $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\mid dV(\\varphi)\\mid$ as more detailed\nones. The very control of V(o) is in a sense a process\nof putting certain not fully defined picks on that curve\nwithin some sectors. To choose optimal sectors for the\npicks and to predict their effect on the harmonics of the\ncurve V(o) the theory is required. Such a theory,\nkind of Fuzzy Fourier Analysis\nusing the following:\na) theorems of Fourier Coefficients estimations (the\nsimplest one |a; |< 2\u0394/\u03c0),\nb) some features of symmetry of Fourier Coefficients,\nc) the concept of the ideal curve (the curve Videal (0)"}, {"title": null, "content": "that does not contain harmonics whose suppression is\na goal of the control),\nd) the concept of a limiting 8 -wide band (the area\nbetween two curves defined as Videal() + 8/2 and\nVideal() 8/2), such that the fall of a certain\nharmonic amplitude in the certain predefined interval\nof values is guaranteed if the curve V(o) will remain\nwithin the band along the whole interval [0, 2\u03c0].\nUsing the described theory we can formulate the\npractical and reachable goal of V(o) control during the\nmodel test as follows: to put V(0) within the predefined\nband at the predefined ideal curve Videal(0) (fig. 4),\nwhich is actually the goal of the RFID design.\nThe model test with RFID have been carried out on\nlong models (about 20 feet length) in a big towing tank\nof Krilov Scientific Institute of Hydrodynamics in St.\nPetersburg (Russia). The calculations of the revolution\nsound have been performed with the original method\nand computer program developed in the same Institute\n(Bavin et al.). The inputs for the program are: the\nfield of flow velocities V(o,r) forward of the\npropeller the propeller's detailed geometry and\nrevolution's rate.\nTo facilitate the empirical design procedure for two\nshaft submarines it has been found convenient to make\nmodels of a RFID with 10\u00b0 -wide changeable rear\nwinglets(fig.5).\nAs you can see from tests results for one shaft\nsubmarine with RFID (fig. 6, 7) the flow improving\neffect is persistent, the A may be lowered by as much\nas 60% and the revolution sound - by 6~10 db. The\nflow improving effect extends to maneuvering which is\nunique: no other devices are known that could automa-\ntically decrease the so-called hull irregularity of the\nflow. The tests have shown also that in case of small\nclearance between a hull and the RFID, the diffuser\neffect may considerably slow the flow down due to a\npre-separational conditions. It is possible to use that\neffect for the improvement of the flow but practically it\nwould be too expensive because of the drag resistance\nincrease. As for two shaft submarines: trying to sup -\npress the A with RFID is hopelessly expensive. A more\ndelicate approach is needed here requiring full use of\nideal curves with 8-wide bands and RFID mdel design\nwith changeable rear winglets (fig.4, fig. 5). The RFID\ndesign results shown on fig 8 have been received with\nreasonable number of towing cart runs."}]}

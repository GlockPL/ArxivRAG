They have proven to be effective in many\ntask-oriented dialog systems where they provide answers to complex questions Hude\u010dek and Du\u0161ek [2023].\nHowever, in educational settings, there is a need for more than just delivering accurate answers. Effective pedagogical\nstrategies are essential for enhancing the educational value of LLMs. Socratic questioning Lepper and Woolverton\n[2002], for instance, helps deepen understanding and encourage critical thinking by prompting learners to reflect more\non their answers. Encouraging a growth mindset, which emphasizes that intelligence and abilities can be developed\nthrough effort and learning strategies Dweck [2006], can help students face challenges positively and learn from their\nerrors. This approach has not only immediate benefits but also long-term effects, as studies have shown that growth\nmindset language positively influences students' academic performance over time Hecht et al. [2023]. Showing care\nand empathy makes learners more engaged and confident, creating a supportive atmosphere that helps them learn\nand achieve better Roorda et al. [2011], Pianta [2017], Robinson [2022].

[2024]. The tutor agent's responses are\ngenerated using zero-shot prompt tuning. We repeatedly adjusted our prompts until the tutor's performance was\nsatisfactory. Our approach to creating prompts follows the 'Flipped Interaction Pattern' White et al. [2023]. In this\nmethod, we first specify the goal of the LLM, then set the context for how long the session should last, and finally\nlimit the length of the generated response. The tutor's main aim is to help the student find the correct answer while\nencouraging them to think more deeply and develop a growth mindset. To keep responses concise, we instruct the tutor\nto limit replies to a maximum of three sentences.\nThe final tutor prompt we used was: 'As an English tutor, your role is to help young learners improve their reading\nand understanding skills. The student has chosen an incorrect answer. Your goal is to guide them to find the correct\nanswer, by thinking deeply and looking for clues in the text. When they get it right, say: 'Exactly! That's the right\nanswer. You can now close this tab and continue with the rest of your worksheet.' Use easy words and encourage them\nto ask questions and think creatively. Help them connect the dots without giving the answer directly. Remember, short\nsentences and clear hints are key.\nTo mimic student-tutor interactions, we also used the Mixtral 8x7b model to simulate different student agents. We\ndesigned four distinct learner profiles that represent different learning styles and details on these profiles are available in\nthe appendix. Each student agent is provided with the passage, the question, its corresponding options, and the previous\nchat history as grounding information, but the correct answer is not given. The student agent first responds to the tutor's\nfeedback on their initial incorrect choice. We set the student LLM to generate only one sentence at a time, to mimic\na typical short student response in a chatbot interaction. The tutor then provides the next piece of guidance, and the\ndialogue continues until the student identifies the correct answer. To finish the dialog session, we wait until the correct\nanswer is reached and the tutor instructs the student to 'close the tab' and move on to the next part of the worksheet or\nuntil the maximum number of turns (10) is reached."}, {"title": "Dataset Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "Tutor Turns", "content": "Throughout the development of our dialog generation process, we continually analyzed each iteration to refine and\nenhance our approach.

The distribution of talktime for the tutor and student agents is\ndepicted in Figure 3. As illustrated in the figure, the tutor agent's responses are consistently longer than those of the\nstudent agent.\nTo assess the quality of tutors' responses, we employed a BERT model finetuned on tutoring data Wang and Demszky\n[2024] to analyze conversational uptake, assessing whether tutors build upon students' contributions. The results of this\nanalysis for the dataset are detailed in the middle of Table 1. Additionally, we utilized a finetuned RoBERTa classifier\nto evaluate the presence of focusing questions Alic et al.

The frequency of these questions within our dataset is shown in the top of Table 1.\nFinally, the types of tutor responses are classified with the TalkMoves Suresh et al. [2022] finetuned ELECTRA model.\nDue to the subject-specific nuances between reading comprehension and the original training data based on math\nclassrooms, we found that 44% of the tutor interactions were classified as 'Other'. The remaining 56% were classified\nas 'Keeping Everyone Together' which encompasses actions such as posing yes/no questions, managing turns, getting\nstudents' attention, keeping students on task, and managing the classroom. Qualitative examples of positive and negative\nuptake, talk moves, and focusing questions can be found in the appendix."}, {"title": "Student Turns", "content": "While the primary focus was on the tutor's responses, significant effort was also made to realistically simulate student\nbehavior.

In addition, we examined student reasoning using a RoBERTa classifier that was finetuned on the NCTE\nmath classroom transcripts Demszky and Hill [2023].

Responses that use GMSL should aim to validate emotions,\nreframe challenges as opportunities for growth, and encourage autonomy in students' learning journeys.

Why might she be crying? Could it be that she needs money for something special related to Christmas?\nRemember, the text mentions that Della is counting her money, which totals one dollar and eighty-seven cents, with\nsixty cents of it in pennies. She feels self-conscious about saving money, as if people might think she's stingy. Does\nthis help you reconsider the options?\nStudent: Now, i did not find any passage that explicitly show that della want to use that money to buy something in\nchristmas\nMixtral8x7b: You are right, the text does not directly state that Della wants to use the money for a Christmas celebration\nor gift. However, let's consider the context and clues given in the passage:\n1. The story takes place during the Christmas season. 2. Della is counting her savings, which will be used soon. 3.\nPeople often associate Christmas with giving and receiving gifts.\nGiven this information, it's reasonable to infer that Della might want the money for a Christmas celebration or gift.\nWhile the text doesn't explicitly state this, connecting the dots based on context and common associations can help us\narrive at the most likely answer. Does this make sense? Student: i think is unreasonable answer, to make conclusion\nbased on that without looking at the passage\nMixtral8x7b: You are correct in wanting to base your answers on evidence from the text. I apologize if my previous\nresponse seemed too speculative. Let's re-examine the passage for any direct or indirect connections between Della's\ntears and Christmas:\n1. \"\"And the next day would be Christmas.\"\" This line establishes that the story takes place during the Christmas season,\nmaking it possible that Della's tears are related to her thoughts about Christmas. 2. The text doesn't mention any\nnegative associations with Christmas for Della, such as it being her least favorite time of year or that she is overwhelmed\nby preparations. 3. The story highlights Della's careful saving of pennies and her emotional reaction upon counting her\nsavings. This context suggests that the money has a significant purpose, which could be related to Christmas.\nWhile the passage does not explicitly state that Della wants to use the money for a Christmas celebration or gift, it also\ndoes not contradict this idea. Considering the time of year and Della's emotional investment in her savings, we can\ninfer that Della might want the money for a Christmas-related purpose. I hope this clarifies the reasoning behind my\nprevious response.\nStudent: There is another explanation, maybe he want use the money for food today, so christmas is nothing to do with\nher tears\nMixtral8x7b: Yes, you're right! It's possible that Della might need the money for food or other daily necessities. In\nfact, the text mentions her \"\"bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher,\"\" which could suggest she is\nshopping for food. The passage does not explicitly state this, but it is a valid interpretation based on the information\nprovided.\nIn situations like these, when there isn't enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion, it's essential to consider\nmultiple plausible explanations. My apologies if my previous responses did not emphasize this adequately. Thank you\nfor your thoughtful engagement with the text and the questions.\nStudent: I understand"}]}

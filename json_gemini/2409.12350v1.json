The creation of a machine vision-based model is important to improving productivity and cutting expenses in the agricultural sector. This cutting-edge model would automate the identification of several cucumber diseases, reducing labor costs and manufacturing time. An exceptionally good dataset is crucial for the effective creation of the classification model. Researchers can identify and categorize cucumber diseases early on thanks to the hyperspectral images of these diseases in the given dataset [1]. For creating an effective agricultural automation system, this dataset [1] is a great resource. This dataset displays a broad range of disease classes, in contrast to previous datasets that contain scant data and concentrate on binary classification (fresh vs. affected). More precise disease diagnosis and enhanced model performance are made possible by the increased diversity of diseases.

Cucumber sickness detection was studied using an artificial neural network [5]. Loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), an isothermal approach, was used to produce a fast and sensitive Psl detection method [6]. The research developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to identify Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum Owen. To design a sensitive and specific pathogen identification system. LAMP's ability to accurately identify F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum Owen was investigated in [7]. Researchers created and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test to identify Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC) with good specificity and sensitivity [7]. Cucumber diseases in Java were examined in [8]. Researchers also sought to identify and molecularly characterize the virus causing these illnesses. The authors [10] present a computer vision-based cucumber sickness diagnosis and categorization approach. Another influential work is [3], [4], [9], and [11]. A distributed system using a wireless acoustic sensor network and machine learning techniques to detect and locate illegal drones was presented in a recent study. The technology addresses drone incursion fear with a dependable and effective solution. A comprehensive examination of the system's design and operation [12] suggests it might reduce drone dangers. Strong AI and wireless sound sensors locate illegal drones. Stats suggest this method boosts drone security in important areas. Machine learning is used to estimate drone locations. [12] presents a machine learning-based drone detection method in their 2018 seminal research. The viability of using two methods to evaluate truth comparison accuracy in detection, classification, and identification was suggested by a recent study [13]. These methodologies are tested for their ability to detect genuine positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Statistics on detection, classification, and identification included true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Studying intervention results.

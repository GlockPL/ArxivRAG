This imaging modality has been improved, making it better suited to\ndifferent medical specialities. The most recent advances are the 0.55T (Tesla) and 7T MRI systems. The introduction\nof these systems marks the continued evolution of MRI technology, offering better image resolution, faster imaging\nprocesses and more accurate diagnoses, which means MRI can be used in a wider range of clinical applications [1].\nThe application of artificial intelligence and deep learning (DL) processing MRI data, belongs to the most recent stages\nof MRI development and represents a notable improvement as it opens up new possibilities to improve image quality,\nreduce the time required to obtain images and improve the diagnostic ability of MRI. DL is an artificial intelligence\ntechnique that is effective in identifying complex patterns in large data sets to help doctors make decisions. It is being\nincreasingly applied to MRI to address inherent limitations in image speed and resolution [2].\nThis comprehensive review examines the cutting-edge advances and clinical implementations of DL for MRI, focused\non the 0.55T and 7T field strengths. Given the rapid pace at which this field is evolving, it is challenging to summarise\nall of the published literature. Previous reviews have identified the fundamental components of DL architectures and\nMRI technologies at different magnetic field strengths [1], [3], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. This review specifically\nexplores how emerging 0.55T, 7T, and DL methods can synergistically elevate medical imaging capabilities and patient\ncare standards. This review was conducted according to the PRISMA diagram [10]. The methodological approach\ninvolved a comprehensive analysis of high-field and low-field MRI systems, including research papers on DL. The\nfollowing databases were searched: PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus, using two search queries '(\"0.55T MRI\"\nAND \"deep learning\")' and '(\"7T MRI\" AND \"deep learning\")' to identify specific papers on the different topics\nmentioned above.\nThe initial search query was employed in Section 2 for a review of the applications of DL in 0.55T MRI. The search\nyielded 11 articles, two from PubMed, seven from Science Direct, and two from Scopus. Following the removal of\nduplicates (4) and ineligible records (5), two articles were identified for review. The following records were considered\nto be ineligible for inclusion in the study: encyclopedias, book chapters, conference abstracts, and editorials. A\ntotal of two articles were identified for inclusion following the initial search query. Nevertheless, to gain a more\nprofound comprehension of low-field strength MRI, an additional search query was implemented: '(\"0.55T MRI\")'.\nThe additional search yielded an additional 47 references, bringing the total number of references included in this\nmanuscript to 49. The 49 references included in this manuscript are composed of seven review articles and two website\nlinks.\nThe second search query was employed in Section 3 for a review of the applications of DL in 7T MRI. The initial\nsearch yielded 688 articles, 64 from PubMed, 577 from Science Direct, and 47 from Scopus. Following the removal\nof duplicates (205), ineligible records (322), and records not in the English language (9), 152 articles were identified\nfor examination. Following the screening of the titles and abstracts, an additional 99 articles were excluded from the\nreview process. The exclusion of these articles was based on the absence of information in the abstracts related to 7T or\nother related topics.

An MRI system uses the magnetic properties of water and fat protons to generate highly detailed 3D\nanatomical images [1]. This section outlines the fundamental principles of MRI technology, as well as the characteristics\nand developments of the 0.55T and 7T MRI systems.\n2.1 Principles of MRI Technology\nMRI operates by using an intense magnetic field that aligns the protons in the tissues of a person. The spins of\nprotons align parallel to it when it is present. The protons are displaced momentarily from their normal position when\nthey receive an RF pulse. After the completion of the RF pulse, the protons again realign with the magnetic field and\nemit energy [3]. This emitted energy is captured by MRI sensors and used to create images which represent body\nstructures as shown in Figure 1.\n2.2 Evolution of 0.55T and 7T MRI Systems\nThe magnetic field intensity of MRI systems influences their performance by changing the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), which in turn affects the quality of a resultant image. According to their field strength, MRI systems are rated as\nlow-field, high-field or ultra-high-field systems.\nLow-Field MRI - 0.55T\nLow-field MRI systems, like the 0.55T MRI, function at a decreased magnetic field strength, leading to reduced\nSNR and CNR. This often leads to a lowering of spatial resolution and a longer duration for scanning. However,\nadvancements in technology have improved the capabilities of low-field MRI. Advanced hardware and sophisticated\nimage reconstruction techniques greatly improve the diagnostic capabilities of modern 0.55T MRI systems [5], [4].\nLow-field MRI's open design provides a major benefit by enhancing patient accessibility and comfort, particularly for\nindividuals with claustrophobia. Moreover, low-field MRI systems are usually more cost-effective, needing minimal\nshielding and consuming less power, ultimately cutting down operational expenses [6].\nHigh-Field and Ultra-High-Field MRI - 7T and above\nTo achieve enhanced image resolution and a more rapid scan time, physicians use MRI systems with high magnetic\nfields, such as 1.5T and 3T [7]. At the same time, ultra-high field MRI systems that focus mainly on 7T and above are\nleading the way in terms of MRI technology. Consequently, the first 7T clinical MRI scanner was launched in 2017,\nmarking a significant advance in this technology that is now applicable at both clinical and research levels [8], [9]. This\nresults in an increase in spatial resolution and SNR, allowing the use of smaller voxels and the presentation of more\ndetailed anatomical structures [7]. This proves advantageous, especially when dealing with neurological diseases, along\nwith musculoskeletal and cardiovascular images. However, UHF MRI has its limitations. The higher intensity magnet\ncan cause dizziness or nausea, as well as artefacts in the resulting images. In addition, processing and storing the large\namounts of data produced requires considerable computing power [7], [8]."}, {"title": "Integration of Deep Learning with MRI", "content": "Incorporating DL methods into MRI technology is a breakthrough, providing new methods to enhance image quality,\nspeed up imaging processes, and enhance diagnostic precision. DL algorithms are being used more in MRI to address\ndisabilities in imaging speed and resolution, leveraging their abilities in pattern recognition and data analysis [2]. DL\ntechniques can enhance image quality for 0.55T MRI systems, boosting SNR and CNR to compete with higher field\nsystems in image output. In higher field strengths DL can assist in handling extensive data, minimising artefacts, and\nenhancing image reconstruction processes for UHF MRI systems [2], [6], [9]. Therefore, these advancements ensure\nbetter diagnostic accuracy, easier patient access, and increased efficiency in imaging, ultimately influencing the direction\nof MRI in clinical settings."}, {"title": "3 Advances in Low-Field MRI - 0.55T", "content": "In 2021, Siemens Healthineers achieved a significant milestone by receiving FDA clearance for its innovative 0.55T\nfield strength MRI scanner, the High-V MRI [11]. This cutting-edge system combines advanced image processing\ntechniques with computational methods to enhance its capabilities. The High-V scanner features a wide 80 cm bore\naperture, purposefully designed to accommodate patients of larger bodies or those who experience claustrophobia,\nprioritising patient comfort and accessibility. This system has a framework called Deep Resolve, which optimises\nthe use of raw data acquired during the initial imaging process. Deep Resolve's algorithms construct individualised\nnoise maps for each scan, identifying areas prone to noise corruption within the final image. This precise identification\nenables targeted measures to reduce noise, resulting in significant image quality improvements without the extension of\nscan times [12].\nThis section examines the applications of computational and advanced processing methods in the context of 0.55T\nMRI, highlighting recent progress and case studies in this field. The numerous articles discussed here have been\ncategorised by body region to illustrate the diverse diagnostic potential of these enhanced low-field MRI approaches.\nEach sub-section presents the studies related to that category, which are also presented in table form, organised by\nauthor, referencing the article, objective, method and results of the study.\nIn 2023, Wang et al. [13] developed a method for 2D turbo spin-echo (TSE) imaging, SPRING-RIO TSE, which\ncompensates for concomitant gradient fields and B0 inhomogeneity at both 0.55T and 1.5T magnetic field strengths. To\ncompensate for concomitant gradient fields and BO inhomogeneity, they implemented gradient waveform modifications\nand reconstruction-based corrections. These modifications were designed to make up for the concomitant self-squared\ngradient terms and the phase increments induced by the B0 field throughout the reading. Through simulations and tests\nusing phantoms, the proposed modifications proved effective. Further validation with data from volunteer subjects\nconfirmed that these modifications enabled high-quality images, enhanced SNR efficiency, and reduced the RF-specific\nabsorption rate (SAR) compared to conventional turbo spin echo imaging techniques. The study indicates that this new\nmethod, SPRING-RIO TSE, offers benefits, particularly in low-field MRI."}, {"title": "3.1 Body Composition Study", "content": "This subsection presents studies on the application of DL with MRI scans for body composition and abdominal\nstudies. The studies explored here are shown in Table 1. Rusche et al. [14] performed a comparative study in 2022\non subject comfort during MRI examination using the latest low-field MRI system with a wider bore aperture (0.55T)\ncompared to the 1.5T MRI system. The research involved a group of 50 patients who had undergone an MRI scan on\nboth machines involved in the survey. Those patients were required to assess their sense of space, noise level, and\ncomfort as well as coil comfort and overall impression of the exam. The findings indicated that the majority of patients\nregarded, the 0.55T MRI scanner as better relating to sense of space, noise levels and general comfort. These noise\nlevels were also measured and showed that 0.55T had markedly reduced noise for all body regions compared to 1.5T:\n\u2022 Brain MRI: 83.8 \u00b1 3.6 dB (0.55T) vs. 89.3 \u00b1 5.4 dB (1.5T), p = 0.04\n\u2022 Spine MRI: 83.7 \u00b1 3.7 dB (0.55T) vs. 89.4 \u00b1 2.6 dB (1.5T), p = 0.004\n\u2022 Hip MRI: 86.3 \u00b1 5.0 dB (0.55T) vs. 89.1 \u00b1 1.4 dB (1.5T), p = 0.04\nThe study found that the larger aperture and lower noise levels of 0.55T MRI scans contribute to patient's comfort\nduring the procedure, reducing anxiety levels.\nIn 2023, Nayak et al. [15] investigated whether it would be possible to profile body composition using a whole-body\nMRI system operating at low-field strengths. Through scans on healthy adults, they refined parameters such as echo\ntime, resolution, and inversion angle. A test-retest study with 10 volunteers confirmed the viability of the optimised\nprotocol. Despite the differences in optimal parameters compared to higher field strengths, image quality remained\ncomparable, without significant issues. Consequently, the study concludes that body composition MRI at 0.55T, with\noptimised parameters, is feasible for assessing conditions like metabolic diseases and obesity.\nIn 2024, Ramachandran et al. [16] made a comparative analysis of abdominal MRI images taken from healthy\nsubjects and patients using a 0.55T MRI. The study involved 15 healthy subjects and 52 patients who were scanned by\nabdominal MRI scans at 0.55T. Additionally, images were taken of healthy individuals at 1.5T and the images were\navailable for comparison on 28 of the 52 patients. Two radiologists independently assessed and scored the quality of\nthe images using a four-level rating scale. The images acquired at 0.55T were considered satisfactory, although some\nsequences may require further optimisation. The radiologists were able to respond to clinical queries for the majority\nof the patient cases. While the diagnostic quality was satisfactory, certain sequences at 0.55T received lower scores\ncompared to those at higher field strengths. Moreover, the average scan time at 0.55T was found to be longer than that\nat higher field strengths, which may present a challenge in clinical settings.\nTian et al. [17] introduced a real-time MRI technique at 0.55T using spiral out-in-out-in sampling combined with\nbalanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) to separate water and fat effectively. This method, tested on healthy\nvolunteers, successfully visualised wrist ligament gaps during motion, enhanced the clarity of epicardial fat and coronary\narteries in the heart, and improved the water-fat contrast for observing small bowel motility in the abdomen. The\nflexible sequence can be customised for various temporal and spatial resolutions, thereby demonstrating its adaptability\nfor a multitude of clinical and research applications.\nDietzel et al. [18] investigated the potential of using a low-field MRI system operating at 0.55T for breast imaging.\nThe study involved a multiparametric breast MRI protocol applied to 12 participants, using a next-generation scanner\n(MAGNETOM Free.Max). The protocol included dynamic T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted\nsequences optimised for the low-field setting. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated the images\nand confirmed that all examinations yielded diagnostic-quality images without significant artefacts. The typical imaging\nphenotypes were effectively visualised, and the total scan time ranged from 10 minutes and 30 seconds to 18 minutes\nand 40 seconds. The results of the study indicated that low-field breast MRI at 0.55T is a viable option for clinical\nuse, delivering diagnostic-quality images within a reasonable examination time. This approach is expected to result\nin reduced procedural costs and facilitate the integration of MRI systems directly within breast clinics, potentially\nenhancing accessibility and efficiency in breast cancer diagnostics.\nKim et al. [19] proposed a novel approach to accelerate MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) scans involving\nDL-based reconstruction techniques at both 3T and 0.55T field strengths. The research team utilised retrospectively\nundersampled data acquired at 3T to train a variational neural network. They then evaluated the performance of their\nproposed method against conventional techniques like parallel imaging and compressed sensing. Furthermore, they\ndeveloped a self-supervised DL reconstruction method and tested their approach in both retrospective and prospective\naccelerated scenarios. The results demonstrated a reduction in the average acquisition time with the variational network\nwhile maintaining an image quality comparable to that of conventional acquisition methods. The variational network\nexhibited superior performance in preserving the sharpness and visibility of hepatobiliary ducts, with promising\nadaptability to MRCP at 0.55T. This study showed the potential of DL-based reconstruction to enhance the efficiency\nand quality of MRCP imaging, paving the way for accelerated clinical applications."}, {"title": "3.2 Musculoskeletal Study", "content": "Low-field MRI has the capability to diagnose various musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Researchers have investi-\ngated the potential benefits and limitations of using low-field MRI systems for MSK imaging applications. The studies\nexplored here are presented in Table 2. In 2023, Breit et al. [20] assessed the potential of a 0.55T MRI system for lumbar\nspine imaging, comparing it to a standard 1.5T system. The study included 14 volunteers who underwent imaging\non both systems, with additional sequences acquired at 0.55T using advanced post-processing techniques. Although\nthe 0.55T images were rated slightly lower in quality compared to the 1.5T images for signal/contrast, resolution, and\nvisualisation, the overall quality of the examination remains good, with a high level of agreement between radiologists.\nThe application of advanced post-processing techniques at 0.55T data showed potential for enhancing image quality\nwhile also reducing the necessary acquisition time.\nIn 2024, Lavrova et al. [21] conducted a study that compared the image quality, variability between reader's\ninterpretations, and diagnostic effectiveness of standard lumbar spine MRI sequences acquired at 0.55T versus those\nacquired at the more conventional field strengths of 1.5T and 3T. The study involved 665 image series from 70 studies,\nwhich were evaluated by two neuroradiologists for overall imaging quality, the presence of artefacts, and the ability to\nvisualise anatomical features using a four-point Likert scale. Despite some sequences at 0.55T receiving lower scores,\nall were considered acceptable for diagnostic use. There was a low level of agreement between readers on individual\nscores, but a high level of agreement on diagnoses, indicating the potential of 0.55T MRI for detecting routine spine\npathologies.\nThe study by Schlicht et al. [22] aimed to evaluate the performance of a DL-based post-processing technique for\nenhancing lumbar spine MRI scans acquired at 0.55T. The primary goals were to assess the resulting image quality and\nthe potential reduction in acquisition time offered by this advanced method. A comparison was made between standard\nDL-based reconstruction and advanced reconstruction (ADLR) in the context of lumbar spine imaging of 18 patients. A\nvisual evaluation by radiologists using a Likert scale demonstrated superior image quality, resolution, and assessability\nof anatomical structures with the ADLR technique. A quantitative analysis revealed that ADLR resulted in higher\ncontrast ratios in fluid-sensitive sequences. Furthermore, ADLR resulted in a significant reduction in image acquisition\ntime, with a decrease of 44.4% from 14:22 minutes to 07:59 minutes. These results show that advanced DL-based\nreconstruction algorithms can improve image quality and reduce the time needed to take a lumbar spine MRI at 0.55T.\nSeifert et al. [23] evaluated the image quality and metal artefact intensity between 0.55T and 1.5T MRI in patients\nwho had undergone posterior fusion surgery with spinal implants. The study involved 50 patients and employed metal\nartefact reduction protocols used in clinical practice for the evaluation of images. The findings revealed that while\ncontrast and resolution were rated lower at 0.55T compared to 1.5T MRI, the ability to evaluate the spinal canal was\nequally effective at both field strengths. However, mild susceptibility artefacts were observed at 0.55T. Furthermore,\nthe study indicated that while the visibility of anatomical structures near metal implants reduced as the implant length\nincreased in 1.5T MRI scans, the visibility stayed consistent and unaffected by implant length in the 0.55T MRI scans.\nThis suggests that the latter may offer a superior assessment of near-metal anatomy, particularly in cases involving\nmulti-level spinal implants.\nIn 2023, Chaudhari et al. [24] conducted a study investigating the feasibility of real-time MRI of the moving wrist\nusing a high-performance 0.55T system. Conventional MRI systems are constrained by limitations in real-time imaging\ndue to the generation of artefacts and power deposition. The study participants underwent wrist motion manoeuvres\nduring MRI scans with temporal resolutions below 100 milliseconds. The objective of the study was to visualise tissues\nto evaluate dynamic wrist instability. The results demonstrated minimal distortion and image artefacts in real-time\nMRI scans, with static MRI providing a complement to the assessment. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that\nhigh-temporal-resolution real-time MRI in conjunction with static MRI is a viable approach with a 0.55T system,\noffering enhanced evaluation of wrist dysfunction and instability.\nLim et al. [25] investigated the potential of real-time MRI to observe the dynamics of speech production using a\n0.55T MRI system. The study involved healthy adult volunteers and employed a range of pulse sequences, including\nbSSFP and gradient-recalled echo. The results demonstrated that both imaging sequences were capable of effectively\ntracking and visualising the intricate tongue motion patterns during the rapid articulation of consonant-vowel syllables.\nNevertheless, bSSFP demonstrated superior SNR in the vocal tract articulators and offered enhanced image quality and\nSNR efficiency, particularly when utilising the shortest readout duration. This result indicates that bSSFP outperforms\ngradient-recalled echo in terms of image quality, even when compared to higher field strengths. The study highlights\nthe potential of using high-performance 0.55T MRI systems for speech-production real-time MRI, with spiral bSSFP\ndemonstrating the capacity to provide enhanced SNR efficiency and image quality, while avoiding the common artefacts.\nSchmidt et al. [26] conducted a study to assess the diagnostic image quality of knee MRI performed at a low magnetic\nfield strength of 0.55T in comparison with the 1.5T MRI. They conducted MRI scans on 20 volunteers using both\nscanners. Two radiologists assessed the MRI sequences, scoring the overall image quality, level of image noise, and\ndiagnostic utility using a five-point rating scale. Furthermore, the study involved assessing the potential presence of\npathologies affecting the menisci, ligaments, and cartilage within the scanned regions. The study demonstrated that\nwhile image quality for specific sequences at 0.55T was comparable to that of 1.5T MRI, it exhibited a slight decline for\nother sequences. Nevertheless, the diagnostic capability for meniscal and cartilage pathologies remained comparable\nbetween the two field strengths. Moreover, the tissue contrast ratios were comparable across both. The inter-observer\nagreement on image quality was satisfactory, particularly about the identification of pathologies. Therefore, the\nimplementation of DL-reconstructed images at 0.55T produced knee MRI scans yielded image quality comparable to\nthat obtained from the higher 1.5T field strength MRI scanners.\nA complementary study by Donners et al. [27] was conducted to assess the efficacy of the new-generation 0.55T\nknee MRI in comparison to 3T knee MRI for patients experiencing acute trauma and knee pain. The research involved\n25 patients presenting with symptoms to obtain knee MRIs on both 0.55T and 3T systems. DL image reconstruction\nalgorithm was employed only on the 0.55T system, resulting in enhanced image quality. Two radiologists independently\nreviewed all images, assessing image quality parameters, detecting MRI findings, and evaluating confidence levels in\nreporting these findings. The study demonstrated that while image quality was rated higher for 3T MRI, there was\nagreement between 0.55T and 3T MRI in detecting various knee lesions. Nevertheless, there was a lower degree\nof agreement and reader confidence in the detection of low-grade cartilage and meniscal lesions in the 0.55T MRI\ncompared to the 3T MRI. This suggests that while the 0.55T knee MRI system, combined with DL image reconstruction,\ncan reliably detect and grade joint lesions in symptomatic patients, it may face challenges in accurately evaluating\nlow-grade cartilage and meniscal lesions when compared to the higher 3T MRI field strength.\nBhattacharjee et al. [28] addressed the feasibility of applying DL segmentation models, originally trained on 3T\nMRI data, directly to low-field 0.55T knee MRI scans of healthy controls. The objective of this study is to evaluate\nthe performance of DL algorithms for quantifying knee biomarkers at 0.55T compared to 3T. Seven healthy subjects\nunderwent bilateral knee MRI acquisitions on both 3T and 0.55T scanners. DL segmentation models were applied\nto segment knee bones and cartilage, and the segmentations were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. The\nresults showed that the DL models exhibited a satisfactory capability to accurately segment and delineate bones and\ncartilaginous structures at 0.55T, although segmentation quality varied between different knee regions. While bone\nsegmentation performance was generally better at 3T, cartilage segmentation was comparable between 0.55T and 3T,\nparticularly for the femoral and tibial regions. However, the patellar region posed challenges, likely due to lower SNR\nat 0.55T. Despite these challenges, the study demonstrated the technical feasibility of using DL segmentation models"}, {"title": "3.3 NeuroImaging Study", "content": "This subsection presents studies on the application of DL with brain MRI scans for neuroimaging purposes. The\nstudies explored here are presented in Table 3. In 2021, Campbell-Washburn et al. [32] investigated the feasibility of\nusing magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) on a high performance 0.55T MRI system for rapid multi-parametric\nquantification. MRF is known for its versatility and ability to provide quantitative imaging at multiple field strengths.\nThe study aims to demonstrate the potential of MRF for whole brain mapping on a modern 0.55T MRI system, which\ncould improve examination efficiency and enable multi-contrast imaging on lower field strength systems. A whole-brain\n3D stack-of-spirals fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) MRF sequence was implemented and quantification\nwas validated using a standardised MRI phantom. The results showed strong correlations between MRF values and\nstandard phantom measurements, with high precision despite the lower SNR at 0.55T. The study concludes that the\nproposed method is feasible at 0.55T, suggesting the potential for high-quality imaging at lower cost, making it attractive\nfor various imaging scenarios.\nIn 2024, Kung et al. [33] conducted a study to assess the feasibility of performing diffusion tensor brain imaging at a\nlower magnetic field strength of 0.55T compared to the more commonly used 3T. Data were collected from a small\ngroup of five healthy subjects using both 0.55T and 3T scanners, with a focus on achieving high-resolution imaging\nwith adequate SNR. To overcome the challenge of reduced SNR at 0.55T, a signal enhancement technique called\nSNR-enhancing joint reconstruction was applied.

Each trending topic typically includes a headline, a description, and numerous comments. Compared with conventional social media contents, trending topics always emerge explosively, and are displayed in a highlight section to ensure users' engagement in current discussions. However, these factors also amplify the influence of poisoning attacks on users in social media platforms. Such attacks often manipulate or distort information in the comments on trending topics to mislead users and spread misinformation. They can result in numerous negative impacts, such as misguiding facts, provoking conflicts, and even destroying social trusts, which are harmful to our society. However, this critical problem remains inadequately studied yet.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited human-like capabilities (Zhao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a), and several studies have proposed to design LLM-based human-like agents to conduct social simulations (Gao et al., 2023a,b; Kova\u010d et al., 2023). By analyzing their results, researchers can draw deep insights into human behaviors, and devise effective policies for social benefit (Hua et al., 2023). However, previous simulation frameworks have limitations that make them unsuitable for simulating trending topics. First of all, most frameworks employ round-based interactions without taking time into consideration (Wang et al., 2023b), despite the fact that trending topics are highly time-sensitive. Second, most social simulations are designed for peer-to-peer interactions where agents primarily communicate with their neighbors (Gao et al., 2023b). However, due to the individual section of trending topics, their message dissemination should be centralized like a hub. Moreover, previous methods seldom focus on dynamic psychological conditions during simulations, and overlook the problem of poisoning attacks in trending topics.\nTo address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, named TrendSim, to simulate trending topics in social media under poisoning attacks. Specifically, our framework designs a time-aware interaction mechanism and centralized message dissemination to adapt to the trending topic scenario, and implement details of a multi-agent interactive system. Besides, we design LLM-based human-like agents with a perception, a memory, and an action module, in order to simulate user behaviors and reflect their psychological conditions.

It has been shown that social media serves as a primary way for spreading scams and malware, with numerous poisoning attacks occurring on social media platforms (Kunwar and Sharma, 2016). Several previous studies have investigated the intentions and characteristics of poisoning attackers in social media (A\u00efmeur et al., 2019; Briscoe et al., 2014). Their behaviors typically involve posting offensive comments and obscene images intended to propagate hate and perpetrate cyberbullying (Chinivar et al., 2022). They also find that poisoning attacks are more inclined to focus on human vulnerabilities (A\u00efmeur et al., 2019).\nMost previous studies focus on conventional contents in social networks, and pay less attention to trending topics in modern social media platforms. However, the poisoning attack on trending topics has become a critical problem, posing a substantial threat to our social environment, which demands wider attention from researchers."}, {"title": "2.2 LLM-based Multi-agent Social Simulation", "content": "Large language models have shown promising capabilities for building autonomous agents, attributed to their excellent language understanding and generation capabilities (Ouyang et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). These agents are typically equipped with extensive modules based on LLMs to perform complex tasks (Xi et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Qin et al., 2023). Recently studies have proposed to utilize LLM-based agents for social simulations, in order to model human behaviors and interactions in different scenarios (Wang et al., 2023b; Park et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023b,a). For instance, S\u00b3 (Gao et al., 2023b) simulates the emergence of social networks and phenomena like information diffusion through LLM-based agent interactions. RecAgent (Wang et al., 2023b) proposes the simulation of user behaviors in the domain of recommender systems. Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023) and AgentSims(Lin et al., 2023) create multi-agent systems as a digital town to replicate humans' daily lives.\nHowever, previous frameworks fail in the scenario of trending topics in social media, mainly due to their lack of time consideration, centralized message dissemination, and reflection of user psychological conditions.

Here, we formulate a trending topic as a public post that describes an explosive event, which users can interact by commenting, replying, and other actions. The lifecycle of a trending topic typically spans from its emergence to its disappearance, commonly lasting less than several hours. During this period, users can express their altitudes by commenting, or exchange opinions by replying to specific comments. These interactions push the evolution of a trending topic, raising a wide discussion, but they also provide opportunities for attackers to spread poisoning attacks."}, {"title": "3.2 Multi-agent Simulation Environment", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2.1 Time-aware Interaction Mechanism", "content": "Different from round-based simulation, our framework integrates a time-aware interaction mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Specifically, each session of interactions occurs at a specific timestamp $T$, and has a duration $\\Delta t$. All the interactions execute in temporal order implemented with a dynamic priority queue (van Emde Boas et al., 1976). For example, if Alice views the trending topic at 3:12 PM and spends two minutes commenting, Bob can view Alice's comment at 3:14 PM. We assume that users access the trending topic following a certain probability distribution $P(t)$ with respect to time $t$. Specifically, $P(t)$ follows an exponential increase at the beginning, then experiences a growth deceleration before the peak, and finally takes a gradual decline to fade out (Lerman and Hogg, 2010). It also ensures $G_0$-smooth and $G_1$-smooth for continuity properties (Barsky and DeRose, 1989). Accordingly, we assume $P(t)$ as\n$P(t) \\propto \\begin{cases}\ne^{A(t-T_m)} & 0 \\le t < T_m, \\\\ \\frac{1}{4 \\alpha} e^{-aA(t - T_m - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})^2 + 1 + \\frac{A}{4 \\alpha}} & T_m \\le t < T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\\\ \\frac{1}{(t-T_m-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1)^{-A}} & t \\ge T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\end{cases}$\nwhere $A, T_m, \\alpha$ are hyper-parameters. Because of the page limitation, more details can be found in Appendix A for better illustration.\nIn order to improve the efficiency of simulation, we initially sample the first time of users' access based on the distribution before the simulation starts, and dynamically sample the next access time at the end of each access."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Centralized Message Dissemination", "content": "Conventional social media messages typically spread through social networks based on user relationships. However, modern social media platforms commonly deploy an individual section to highlight trending topics, making their message dissemination through a centralized hub rather than a peer-to-peer network. For example, Weibo Hot Searches provides a real-time list of top-50 popular hashtags as trending topics, and all the users can directly access them from the index page. Therefore, we implement centralized message dissemination for simulating trending topics.\nSpecifically, TrendSim has three primary ways to disseminate messages, shown in Figure 1(b). First of all, each trending topic features a public description consisting of a title, a summary, and the full content, which is visible to all the users in social media. Second, TrendSim allows users to post their comments under the trending topic, which are then accessible to others. Finally, TrendSim allows users to reply to any comments under the trending topic, and these replies are also visible to other users. By implementing these three mechanisms, users are able to get, post, and exchange their messages on trending topics in TrendSim."}, {"title": "3.2.3 User-Environment Interactive System", "content": "We design an interactive system between users and a trending topic. It defines the user's observation space, action space, and transition mechanism, illustrating how the user's action influences the trending topic.

Then, users can choose one action among liking, commenting, reposting, viewing more comments (fetch next k comments), viewing details of a specific comment (navigate to Comment Page) or leaving (finish this session).\n\u2022 Comment Page: users observe the specific comment with its top-k replies, then take actions to like, reply or go back (navigate to Main Page).\nMoreover, user actions can influence the environment as well. Specifically, commenting on the trending topic or replying to comments can leave messages that influence subsequent observations of other users. Besides, liking a trending topic can add the popularity, and the numbers of likes on comments determine their rankings. In order to avoid taking infinite actions, we assume a maximum number of interactions in each session."}, {"title": "3.3 LLM-based User Agent", "content": "We design LLM-based agents to simulate users in social media.

It also dynamically affects user behaviors during the simulation. Therefore, according to cognitive psychology, we design a memory module consisting of three levels: long-term memory, short-term memory, and flash memory.\nLong-term memory incorporates the summary of the user's lifelong experiences (i.e., profiles), and remains unchanged during the simulation. Specifically, we implement long-term memory of agents by distilling their posts from real-world social media platforms before the simulation starts, followed by\n$m_l \\leftarrow LTM(f, \\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_N \\}),$\nwhere $m_l$ means the long-term memory, and $\\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_N \\}$ are the posts of a real-world user. Short-term memory aims to maintain the dynamic condition of the user's psychology during the simulation. We utilize three major aspects to model short-term memory in our scenario as follows.\n\u2022 Emotion: Direct emotional feeling of the user when browsing current contents.\n\u2022 Opinion: Personal altitude of the user towards the trending topic after participating in it.\n\u2022 Social Confidence: Personal belief of the user that trusts the justice of society.\nWe design a reflection process to dynamically update short-term memory after each interaction. Specifically, we have\n$m_s \\leftarrow Reflection(f, I, A, m_s),$\nwhere $m_s$ means short-term memory and $A$ indicates the action of user. Flash memory is the most immediate part of memory, storing the impression of observations. Specifically, we let flash memory $m_f = I$ for the current interaction. In summary, the memory of an LLM-based user agent is defined as $M = (m_l, m_s, m_f)$ that affects user behaviors."}, {"title": "3.3.3 Action Module", "content": "Based on the memory, our user agents can generate actions towards their observations.

Therefore, we intend to verify and analyze this phenomenon with TrendSim. Specifically, we study the conditions of the user's psychology during the simulation, and compare them among four levels of attacks. The metrics of psychological conditions include Emotion and Social Confidence that we have introduced in Section 3.3.2, expressed ranging from 0 to 1. The levels of attacks include: (1) SE: no attackers injected. (2) PA-10: 10% attackers injected. (3) PA-30: 30% attackers injected. (4) PA-50: 50% attackers injected. These attackers are introduced according to Section 3.4. In addition, we categorize the trending topics into three sentiment groups, including positive, negative, and neutral.\nWe focus at the end time of simulations, calculating the average conditions and divergences among users. The results are shown in Table 5. We find that most poisoning attacks have negative impacts on users in social media, but their effects vary in different groups. Compared with the negative and neutral groups, the positive group is affected the most, potentially due to the larger contrast between poisoning comments and normal comments. Moreover, we find that the results are not proportional to the levels of attacks, where fewer attackers can probably cause larger impacts."}, {"title": "Problem 2: How do users' psychological conditions dynamically change over time?", "content": "We further study the dynamic changes in users' psychological conditions over time.

However, there are still certain limitations. First of all, TrendSim currently conducts simulations solely in textual form, without multi-modal information that is important in social media as well. For instance, fake photos can also lead to poisoning attacks in trending topics. Second, like previous works on social simulations, TrendSim is also based on a series of assumptions. These assumptions arise from unobserved factors in the real world that researchers cannot fully account for. Consequently, due to these assumptions, some biases may exist in our simulations, limiting their ability to accurately replicate all real-world details. This alignment problem also occurs in other applications of social simulations."}, {"title": "Ethical Impacts", "content": "TrendSim aids in uncovering insights into poisoning attacks on social media trends, which is beneficial for developing defense mechanisms. However, every coin has two sides. The availability of TrendSim may inadvertently contribute to the evolution of attackers, who could adapt and evolve in response to the defense mechanisms employed on social media platforms."}, {"title": "A Details of Time Mechanisms", "content": "For the lifecycle of a trending topic in the time-aware interaction system, we divide it into three stages, which are consistent with the real pattern in social media platforms. In the first stage, there is an explosive growth in social attention and user entrance, so we model this stage with an exponential function. During the second stage, the growth of users' browsing slows down, and gradually begins to decline. For this phase, we employ a power function with a positive exponent. In the final stage, the attention to the trending topic gradually fades, and we use a power function with a negative exponent to model this stage. In order to dynamically adjust the curves of different trending posts according to their attractions, we set different hyper-parameters to diversify their functions. Moreover, we also design the function of probability distribution with $G_0$-smooth and $G_1$-smooth. The probability distribution of users for the trending topic is\n$P(t) \\propto \\begin{cases}\ne^{A(t-T_m)} & 0 < t < T_m, \\\\ \\frac{1}{4 \\alpha} e^{-aA(t - T_m - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})^2 + 1 + \\frac{A}{4 \\alpha}} & T_m \\le t < T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\\\ \\frac{1}{(t-T_m-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1)^{-A}} & t \\ge T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\end{cases}$\nwhere $A$ is a parameter to reflect the breaking degree of the trending topic, $\\alpha$ and $T_m$ are two hyper-parameters that could adjust the curve. Then, we prove the function is $G_0$-smooth and $G_1$-smooth.\nTheorem 1. The function P(t) is $G_0$-smooth.\nProof. Given the probability distribution above, we denote\n$f(t)=\\begin{cases}\ne^{A(t-T_m)} & 0<t<T_m, \\\\ \\frac{1}{4 \\alpha} e^{-aA(t - T_m - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})^2 + 1 + \\frac{A}{4 \\alpha}} & T_m < t < T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\\\ \\frac{1}{(t-T_m-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1)^{-A}} & t \\ge T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}. \\end{cases}$\nSo we can re-write the function P(t) as\n$P(t) = \\frac{1}{S} \\cdot f(t)$, that is\n$P(t) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{S} e^{A(t-T_m)} & 0<t<T_m, \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{S} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4 \\alpha} e^{-aA(t - T_m - \\frac{1}{\\alpha})^2 + 1 + \\frac{A}{4 \\alpha}} & T_m < t < T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{S} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(t-T_m-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1)^{-A}} & t \\ge T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}. \\end{cases}$\nwhere $S = \\int_{0}^{+ \\infty} f(t)dt$ is a normalization for the probability distribution. Obviously, the function $P(t)$ is continuous in its respective segments. Therefore, we just need to demonstrate the continuity at the points where these segments connect:\n$\\lim_{t \\to T_m^{-}} P(x) = \\lim_{t \\to T_m^{+}} P(x) = \\frac{1}{S},$\n$\\lim_{t \\to T_m+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}^{-}} P(x) = \\lim_{t \\to T_m+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}^{+}} P(x) = \\frac{1}{S},$ which verifies these segments are continuous at connection posts. Therefore, the function P(t) is $G_0$-smooth.\nTheorem 2. The function P(t) is $G_1$-smooth.\nProof. We calculate the first-order derivative of P(t).\nP'(t) = $\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{A}{S} e^{A(t-T_m)} & 0\\leq t<T_m, \\\\ \n\\frac{2 \\alpha A}{S} \\cdot (t - T_m-\\frac{1}{2 \\alpha}) e^{2 \\alphaA \\cdot (t - T_m - \\frac{1}{2 \\alpha})^2+1} & T_m < t < T_m+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}, \\\\ \n-\\frac{A}{S} (t-T_m-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1)^{-A-1} & t \\ge T_m + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}. \\end{cases}$\nObviously, the function $P'(t)$ is continuous in its respective segments. Therefore, we just need to demonstrate the continuity at the points where these segments connect:\n$\\lim_{t \\to T_m^{-}} P'(x) = \\frac{A}{S}, \\qquad \\lim_{t \\to T_m^{+}} P'(x) = \\frac{A}{S},$\n$\\lim_{t \\to T_m+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}^{-}} P'(x) = \\frac{-A}{S}, \\qquad \\lim_{t \\to T_m+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}^{+}} P'(x) = \\frac{-A}{S},$ which verifies these segments are continuous at connection posts. Therefore, the function P(t) is $G_1$-smooth.\nWe draw the curve of the function f(x) as follows in Figure 5(a).

Introduction", "content": "Semiconductors, crucial for modern electronics:, undergo a complex multi-step production process. Fabless firms such as Qualcomm and NVIDIA design and simulate chip functionalities, while manufacturing is outsourced to foundries like TSMC and Samsung. Foundries handle semiconductor chip fabrication, which includes photolithography to imprint circuit patterns on silicon wafers, etching and doping for circuit formation, and intricate layering for circuit interconnection. After fabrication, chips undergo quality assurance, including electrical and stress testing, to confirm performance and defect-free status. Packaged semiconductors are assembled into devices like microprocessors and memory chips, integrated into various electronic systems, such as consumer electronics, automotive technologies, and space applications. Miniaturization is crucial to the semiconductor industry, enabling the creation of smaller, more powerful, and more efficient devices that advance the capabilities and functionality of electronic products. However, this pursuit faces challenges that require precision and control to ensure system-level performance and overcoming manufacturing inaccuracies. To tackle these obstacles, the industry leverages sophisticated imaging techniques for thorough testing and analysis. The relentless pursuit of miniaturization in semiconductor manufacturing demands an ever-increasing focus on achieving nanoscale precision. Advanced tools, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), play a vital role in the semiconductor industry's push for precision. These electron beam instruments offer high-resolution micrographs (microscopic images), revealing intricate details of semiconductor materials and structures at the nanoscale. Their sophisticated imaging capabilities are crucial for quality control, including failure analysis, allowing precise characterization of microstructures. As indispensable assets in ensuring semiconductors conform to design specifications, these tools help enable subsequent process optimization or design adjustments to mitigate defects. Characterizing materials at the nanoscale is critical to driving ongoing technological progress. However, current technology falls short in effectively addressing the full spectrum of complexities and specialized requirements for material characterization in the semiconductor industry, particularly in accurate labeling and analysis of electron micrographs. Therefore, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) like Gemini(Team et al., 2023) and GPT-4 Turbo with Vision(OpenAI, 2023), which combine advanced natural language processing with visual understanding capabilities, can significantly impact the semiconductor manufacturing process in several ways. These vision-language models allow for the analysis of high-resolution electron micrographs, revealing intricate nanoscale structures of semiconductor materials. By identifying and providing insights into patterns, the multimodal large language models enable quality control and improve the precision and efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing. While proprietary, general-purpose LMMs offer benefits, their adoption faces challenges due to concerns regarding sharing enterprise data. Sharing sensitive information with third-party services could expose novel designs and processes, undermining semiconductor firms' intellectual property portfolio and jeopardizing future innovation. Conversely, open-source, small-scale multimodal models (SMMs) like LLaVA(Liu et al., 2023) and MiniGPT-4(Zhu et al., 2023) can be more cost-effective for task-specific customization on microscopic image analysis, enabling safe, reliable, on-premises enterprise adoption. The smaller multimodal models offer better interpretability due to their open-source nature. However, they may not match the reasoning and generalization capabilities of proprietary LMMs, sometimes producing less coherent and contextually relevant outputs. In addition, generating high-quality training datasets is crucial for customizing SMMs for microscopic image analysis, but acquiring such datasets is scarce and expensive. The annotation process requires expert knowledge and specialized tools, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, the diverse image characteristics and representations resulting from the different imaging techniques pose a significant challenge to developing a generalizable multimodal model that can perform effectively across various electron micrograph-based datasets. Furthermore, electron micrograph-based image-captioning and open-ended VQA tasks are promising but challenging due to complex image characteristics, such as high intra-class dissimilarity, high inter-class similarity, and spatial heterogeneity (refer Figure1). These complexities pose obstacles to accurate image understanding and question answering. To address the challenges of privacy concerns, scarcity of high-quality data, and small-scale models generalization and interpretability, our study introduces a novel approach called 'On-Premises Secure Multimodal Instruction Tuning of SMMs'.

In this work, we present the Multimodal Assistant for Electron Micrograph Analysis (MAEMI), an end-to-end trained, small-scale multimodal model designed for microscopic image analysis.

Technical Appendix", "content": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA(Hu et al., 2021)) is a deep learning technique used to efficiently fine-tune large-scale pre-trained language models on consumer hardware to adapt for niche domain-specific tasks. It accomplishes this without introducing additional inference latency and without the need for extensive retraining. LoRA adapts these large-scale models to domain-specific tasks by preserving the vast knowledge acquired during pretraining, thereby avoiding catastrophic forgetting-a phenomenon where the language model loses previously learned information while acquiring new information. This selective adaptation of large pre-trained language models is achieved by inserting small pairs of trainable low-rank weight matrices, known as adapters, into each pretrained model layer. By keeping the original pretrained model weights unchanged, LoRA updates only these auxiliary parameters, achieving comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning. LoRA primarily focuses on the linear layers in Transformer-based large-scale language models (Vaswani et al., 2017), for several key reasons: (a) These layers are prevalent in such architectures and contain a significant portion of the language model's parameters. (b) They are well-suited for low-rank approximations, offering a balance between language model adaptability and computational efficiency. (c) Additionally, modifying linear layers directly impacts the language model's learning capabilities, making them ideal targets for efficient and effective fine-tuning. By taking advantage of the distinct features of linear layers, LoRA incorporates additional trainable parameters (AW) to capture task-specific information, thereby updating the pretrained language model without altering the original weights (Wo). The low-rank adaptation, in which the original weight matrices are transformed by adding the product of pair of low-rank matrices, effectively allows the pretrained language model to learn domain-specific tasks, as expressed below:\nY = (Wo + AW)X = WX + (AB)X (1)\nHere, Y \u2208 \\mathbb{R}^{b\u00d7dout} and X \u2208 \\mathbb{R}^{b\u00d7din} represent the output and input tensors, respectively. We omit the bias term for simplicity. din and dout denote the input and output dimensions, respectively. b denotes the batch size. The original weight matrix, denoted as Wo \u2208 \\mathbb{R}^{din\u00d7dout}, preserves the pretrained knowledge. AW, the low-rank approximation added to Wo during language model adaptation, enables fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks while preserving general capabilities. The projection-down weight matrix A has dimensions \\mathbb{R}^{din\u00d7r}, and the projection-up weight matrix B has dimensions \\mathbb{R}^{r\u00d7dout}. The rank of the decomposition, denoted as r, is significantly smaller than din or dout (i.e., r < din or dout). a, a positive constant, is typically valued at . The rank, r, is a critical hyperparameter that influences the balance between the pretrained language model's adaptation capacity, computational efficiency, and overall performance during the fine-tuning process for task-specific customization. During training, the low-rank weight matrices B and A are updated, while Wo remains fixed. During the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models, gradients for each trainable parameter are calculated using the loss function. These gradients guide optimizers, such as Adam(Kingma & Ba, 2014) or SGD(Robbins & Monro, 1951), in updating the trainable parameters. Additionally, optimizers maintain extra state information for these parameters, which includes momentum and adaptive learning rates. Thus, fine-tuning pre-trained language models necessitates storing not only the model parameters but also their gradients and optimizer states in memory. LoRA proportionally decreases the memory overhead associated with the gradients and optimizer states by reducing the number of trainable parameters through low-rank adaptation. This reduction is crucial for task-specific fine-tuning of large-scale language models. Consequently, LORA requires fewer computational resources than full fine-tuning, making it a more efficient and scalable approach for adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks. However, substantial memory is still necessary to store the large input activations (i.e., the high-dimensional intermediate outputs of layers, such as X in Equation 1) during the feed-forward pass. This is necessary for computing the gradients of the low-rank weights during back-propagation. High activation memory demands significantly limit scalability, especially when computational resources are constrained. Approaches such as selective LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) or activation recomputation (Chen et al., 2016) can potentially alleviate these demands, but suffer from trade-offs in terms of performance and efficiency. In conclusion, while LoRA enables efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models to specific tasks or domains, addressing the substantial activation memory demands during fine-tuning remains a key challenge. LoRA-FA (Zhang et al., 2023) significantly reduces the activation memory footprint by freezing the pretrained weights (W0), the projection-down weight (A), and updating only the projection-up weight (B) in each linear layer. In LoRA-FA, the frozen A is randomly initialized from a normal distribution, while B is initialized to zero and updated during fine-tuning. This approach allows for the computation of gradients solely for B, leading to a substantial reduction in computational load. Moreover, it necessitates storing only the reduced-dimensionality input to B (i.e., AX), where A maps the high-dimensional input X to a significantly smaller r-dimensional space, facilitating the computation of gradients for B during backpropagation with reduced activation memory. This approach significantly reduces the activation memory requirements without compromising fine-tuning performance and without introducing additional computational overhead and inference latency. Consequently, it enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models under resource constraints while preserving accuracy and minimizing memory consumption. However, LoRA-FA may have potential limitations, including potentially slower convergence rates in the initial stages of fine-tuning and the need for careful hyperparameter optimization of rank r to achieve peak performance. Furthermore, LORA-FA is a static low-rank adapter that works only with a specifically trained rank r. To address these limitations, DyLoRA(Valipour et al., 2022) introduces dynamic low-rank adapters that are trainable and deployable across a range of ranks, thereby eliminating the need to find the optimal rank through multiple trainings. Dynamic low-rank adapters offer several key benefits. Firstly, their ability to dynamically adjust their rank allows for an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and pre-trained language model performance on specialized domain-specific tasks. Secondly, because these adapters can adapt their rank according to the specific task and data distribution, they are particularly well-suited for scenarios involving continuous learning or frequent changes in data distributions, especially when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We utilize DyLoRA to train and deploy LoRA-FA across a range of ranks, r \u2208 Range[rmin, rmax], with 'min and rmax as new hyperparameters. During training at each step, a rank b is sampled from a pre-defined categorical distribution, b~ PB(Range[rmin, rmax]) and the matrices are truncated to Ab and B\u2193b as follows:\nB+b = B[1: b,:] \nac\\\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c A+6 = A[:, 1 : 6]\nY = WoX + (aA+B+b)X\nwhere Atb and B\u2193b are the truncated forms of A and B at rank b, the back-propagation involves computing gradients \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}} and \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial B_{\\uparrow b}}, where L is the loss function. The back-propagation technique aims to update these matrices based on the loss function, taking into account the dynamic adaptation in rank. We compute gradient with respect to B as follows: Consider the contribution to the output Y from B: YB = (aA\u21936B\u21936)X. The gradient of the loss L with respect to Bb is:\n \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}} =  \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}{\\partial B^{\\downarrow b}} \\\\\n= aA_{b}\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}X\nSimilarly, the gradient of the loss L with respect to A\u21936 is:\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}\\frac{\\partial Y_{\\beta}}{\\partial A^{\\downarrow b}} \\\\\n=  \\frac{B}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}}\\left( \\frac{B}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}}X \\right)\nThe gradients are used to update the trainable parameters using an optimizer like Adam or SGD as follows,\nB+6 = B46 - n. \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial B_{new}^+b}; A 16 = A tow - n. \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial A_{\\downarrow b}}\nB[1: b,:] = Bow; A[:, 1:6] = Aw\nwhere n is the learning rate. We manage the computational complexity associated with varying ranks in DyLoRA-FA through custom gradient accumulation and rank normalization. Gradient accumulation enables more stable and efficient learning by collecting gradients over multiple iterations, while rank normalization equalizes the impact of different ranks on language model fine-tuning by scaling gradients according to rank size. We employ weight-only quantization (WOQ) for fine-tuning pre-trained language models. WOQ compresses the original weights of the pre-trained language model by converting its high-precision weights (usually 16-bit floating-point) into lower-precision formats (e.g., 8-bit integers). This results in a drastic reduction in the language model's memory footprint and computational requirements. We fine-tune the quantized pre-trained language model on specific datasets related to the target domain-specific task using the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) technique such as DyLoRA-FA, which compensates for any accuracy drops resulting from quantization. DyQLORA-FA, which involves quantization, has been found to reduce memory requirements significantly, albeit at the cost of a slightly longer training time. This trade-off is generally considered acceptable, especially when it allows for the use of low-cost GPUs. In summary, DyQLoRA-FA is a flexible and efficient method for fine-tuning large language models across various rank sizes. It maintains performance without retraining, is highly memory-efficient, has low computational cost, and achieves comparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning on diverse tasks."}]}

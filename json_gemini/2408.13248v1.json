Consequently, this\nleads to improved grounded language generation and visual\nreasoning capabilities, resulting in more accurate answers.\nFurthermore, our approach facilitates knowledge distillation\nfrom larger to smaller models, ultimately enhancing their\nperformance to be on par with larger models in microscopic\nimage analysis tasks. Our novel encoder-decoder multi-\nmodal framework efficiently processes and aligns images\nand text to generate textual responses to questions across\nimage captioning and open-ended VQA tasks. Key compo-\nnents of MAEMI for the zero-shot image captioning task are\nillustrated in Figure 2. The multimodal model, MAEMI, inte-\ngrates visual processing and language modeling for answer-\ning questions about specific image features. It includes: (a)\nThe vision encoder, using a vision transformer(Dosovitskiy\net al., 2020), analyzes the microscopic images by splitting\nthem into patches and using self-attention mechanism to\ncapture beyond pair-wise patch relationships. This allows\nfor understanding the global context and highlighting rel-\nevant visual regions and relationships. A <cls> token at-\ntends to and aggregates information from all patches, re-\nsulting in a higher-level visual semantic representation to\ncapture the overall context or summary of the input image.\n(b)The text encoder, crucial for analyzing end-user ques-\ntions, takes as input an interleaved multimodal prompt. We\ninsert <image> token in the prompt at the image location\nand append an  token to facilitate multimodal in-\ntegregation, with its output embedding symbolizing the fused\nrepresentation. The text encoder leverages instruction-tuned\nLlama-2-7b, a pretrained language model, to capture lan-\nguage nuances and context. The language-only model is\ncustomized using parameter-efficient fine tuning technique,\nenhancing its ability to interpret end-user questions. Both\nthe vision and language-only unimodal encoders synergize\nto interpret end-user questions and analyze visual input for\ngenerating answers consistent with the visual context. (c)\nIt utilizes a multi-layered structure with multiple blocks,\nalternating between self-attention and gated cross-attention\nblocks. This design facilitates complex interactions between\nvisual and textual modalities. By extracting and refining\ninformation from both modalities at each level, the frame-\nwork progressively builds a comprehensive understanding,\nenabling coherent and contextually relevant answers to the\nend-user questions. Gated cross-attention blocks integrate\nvisual features with textual features. The gating mechanism\nacts as a non-linear filter and controls the flow of informa-\ntion from the vision encoder to the language processing\ncross-attention blocks, allowing the framework to focus on\nrelevant visual features for the text generation task. Self-\nattention blocks, on the other hand, allow the framework\nto weigh the importance of different parts of the fused in-\nformation. Within the self-attention blocks, this is used to\nrefine the text features based on their context within the\ntext itself. We train the framework in a supervised learn-\ning setting, minimizing language modeling loss to ground\nits text generation in visual information.

Technical Appendix", "content": "A.1. Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation\nMemory Reduction (DyQLoRA-FA)\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA(Hu et al., 2021)) is a deep\nlearning technique used to efficiently fine-tune large-scale\npre-trained language models on consumer hardware to adapt\nfor niche domain-specific tasks. It accomplishes this with-\nout introducing additional inference latency and without\nthe need for extensive retraining. LoRA adapts these large-\nscale models to domain-specific tasks by preserving the vast\nknowledge acquired during pretraining, thereby avoiding\ncatastrophic forgetting-a phenomenon where the language\nmodel loses previously learned information while acquiring\nnew information. This selective adaptation of large pre-\ntrained language models is achieved by inserting small pairs\nof trainable low-rank weight matrices, known as adapters,\ninto each pretrained model layer. By keeping the original\npretrained model weights unchanged, LoRA updates only\nthese auxiliary parameters, achieving comparable perfor-\nmance to full-parameter fine-tuning. LoRA primarily fo-\ncuses on the linear layers in Transformer-based large-scale\nlanguage models (Vaswani et al., 2017), for several key rea-\nsons: (a) These layers are prevalent in such architectures and\ncontain a significant portion of the language model's param-\neters. (b) They are well-suited for low-rank approximations,\noffering a balance between language model adaptability and\ncomputational efficiency. (c) Additionally, modifying linear\nlayers directly impacts the language model's learning capa-\nbilities, making them ideal targets for efficient and effective\nfine-tuning. By taking advantage of the distinct features of\nlinear layers, LoRA incorporates additional trainable param-\neters (AW) to capture task-specific information, thereby\nupdating the pretrained language model without altering the\noriginal weights (Wo). The low-rank adaptation, in which\nthe original weight matrices are transformed by adding the\nproduct of pair of low-rank matrices, effectively allows the\npretrained language model to learn domain-specific tasks,\nas expressed below:\nY = (Wo + AW)X = WoX + (AB)X"}, {"content": "Here, Y \u2208 Rb\u00d7dout and X \u2208 Rb\u00d7din represent the output and\ninput tensors, respectively. We omit the bias term for sim-\nplicity. din and dout denote the input and output dimensions,\nrespectively. b denotes the batch size. The original weight\nmatrix, denoted as Wo \u2208 Rdin\u00d7dout, preserves the pretrained\nknowledge. AW, the low-rank approximation added to\nWo during language model adaptation, enables fine-tuning\nfor domain-specific tasks while preserving general capabili-\nties. The projection-down weight matrix A has dimensions\nRdin\u00d7r, and the projection-up weight matrix B has dimen-\nsions Rr\u00d7dout. The rank of the decomposition, denoted as r,\nis significantly smaller than din or dout (i.e., r < din or dout).\na, a positive constant, is typically valued at. The rank, r,\nis a critical hyperparameter that influences the balance be-\ntween the pretrained language model's adaptation capacity,\ncomputational efficiency, and overall performance during\nthe fine-tuning process for task-specific customization. Dur-\ning training, the low-rank weight matrices B and A are\nupdated, while Wo remains fixed. During the fine-tuning\nof pre-trained language models, gradients for each trainable\nparameter are calculated using the loss function. These gra-\ndients guide optimizers, such as Adam(Kingma & Ba, 2014)\nor SGD(Robbins & Monro, 1951), in updating the trainable\nparameters. Additionally, optimizers maintain extra state in-\nformation for these parameters, which includes momentum\nand adaptive learning rates. Thus, fine-tuning pre-trained\nlanguage models necessitates storing not only the model\nparameters but also their gradients and optimizer states in\nmemory. LoRA proportionally decreases the memory over-\nhead associated with the gradients and optimizer states by\nreducing the number of trainable parameters through low-\nrank adaptation. This reduction is crucial for task-specific\nfine-tuning of large-scale language models. Consequently,\nLORA requires fewer computational resources than full fine-\ntuning, making it a more efficient and scalable approach\nfor adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks.\nHowever, substantial memory is still necessary to store the\nlarge input activations (i.e., the high-dimensional interme-\ndiate outputs of layers, such as X in Equation 1) during\nthe feed-forward pass. This is necessary for computing the\ngradients of the low-rank weights during back-propagation.\nHigh activation memory demands significantly limit scal-\nability, especially when computational resources are con-\nstrained. Approaches such as selective LoRA (Hu et al.,\n2021) or activation recomputation (Chen et al., 2016) can\npotentially alleviate these demands, but suffer from trade-\noffs in terms of performance and efficiency. In conclusion,\nwhile LoRA enables efficient adaptation of pre-trained lan-\nguage models to specific tasks or domains, addressing the\nsubstantial activation memory demands during fine-tuning\nremains a key challenge. LoRA-FA (Zhang et al., 2023)\nsignificantly reduces the activation memory footprint by\nfreezing the pretrained weights (W0), the projection-down\nweight (A), and updating only the projection-up weight (B)\nin each linear layer. In LoRA-FA, the frozen A is randomly\ninitialized from a normal distribution, while B is initialized\nto zero and updated during fine-tuning. This approach al-\nlows for the computation of gradients solely for B, leading\nto a substantial reduction in computational load. Moreover,\nit necessitates storing only the reduced-dimensionality input\nto B (i.e., AX), where A maps the high-dimensional input\nX to a significantly smaller r-dimensional space, facilitating\nthe computation of gradients for B during backpropagation\nwith reduced activation memory. This approach signifi-\ncantly reduces the activation memory requirements without\ncompromising fine-tuning performance and without intro-"}, {"title": "Instruction-Tuning Small-Scale Language-and-Vision Assistant for Electron Micrograph Analysis", "content": "ducing additional computational overhead and inference\nlatency. Consequently, it enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-\ntrained language models under resource constraints while\npreserving accuracy and minimizing memory consumption.\nHowever, LoRA-FA may have potential limitations, includ-\ning potentially slower convergence rates in the initial stages\nof fine-tuning and the need for careful hyperparameter op-\ntimization of rank r to achieve peak performance. Further-\nmore, LORA-FA is a static low-rank adapter that works only\nwith a specifically trained rank r. To address these limita-\ntions, DyLoRA(Valipour et al., 2022) introduces dynamic\nlow-rank adapters that are trainable and deployable across\na range of ranks, thereby eliminating the need to find the\noptimal rank through multiple trainings. Dynamic low-rank\nadapters offer several key benefits. Firstly, their ability to\ndynamically adjust their rank allows for an optimal trade-\noff between computational efficiency and pre-trained lan-\nguage model performance on specialized domain-specific\ntasks. Secondly, because these adapters can adapt their\nrank according to the specific task and data distribution,\nthey are particularly well-suited for scenarios involving con-\ntinuous learning or frequent changes in data distributions,\nespecially when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We\nutilize DyLoRA to train and deploy LoRA-FA across a\nrange of ranks, r \u2208 Range[rmin, rmax], with 'min and rmax as\nnew hyperparameters. During training at each step, a rank\nb is sampled from a pre-defined categorical distribution,\nb~ PB(Range[rmin, max]) and the matrices are truncated\nto Atb and B\u2193b as follows:\nB+b = B[1: b,:];\nA+6 = A[:, 1 : 6];\nY = WoX + (aA+B+b)X\nwhere Atb and B\u2193b are the truncated forms of A and B\nat rank b, the back-propagation involves computing gradi-\nents and, where L is the loss function.

We manage the computational\ncomplexity associated with varying ranks in DyLoRA-FA\nthrough custom gradient accumulation and rank normal-\nization. Gradient accumulation enables more stable and\nefficient learning by collecting gradients over multiple it-\nerations, while rank normalization equalizes the impact of\ndifferent ranks on language model fine-tuning by scaling\ngradients according to rank size. We employ weight-only\nquantization (WOQ) for fine-tuning pre-trained language\nmodels. WOQ compresses the original weights of the pre-\ntrained language model by converting its high-precision\nweights (usually 16-bit floating-point) into lower-precision\nformats (e.g., 8-bit integers). This results in a drastic reduc-\ntion in the language model's memory footprint and com-\nputational requirements. We fine-tune the quantized pre-\ntrained language model on specific datasets related to the\ntarget domain-specific task using the parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) technique such as DyLoRA-FA, which\ncompensates for any accuracy drops resulting from quantiza-\ntion. DyQLORA-FA, which involves quantization, has been\nfound to reduce memory requirements significantly, albeit at\nthe cost of a slightly longer training time. This trade-off is\ngenerally considered acceptable, especially when it allows\nfor the use of low-cost GPUs. In summary, DyQLoRA-FA is\na flexible and efficient method for fine-tuning large language\nmodels across various rank sizes. It maintains performance\nwithout retraining, is highly memory-efficient, has low com-\nputational cost, and achieves comparable performance to\nfull-parameter fine-tuning on diverse tasks.\nA.2. Fine-Tuning, Pretrained Large Language\nModels (LLMs)\nLlama 2(Touvron et al., 2023), an advanced autoregressive\npretrained language transformer built for natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks, leverages supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF) to generate responses ideal for chat applications\nand various language generation tasks. Its robust foun-\ndation in understanding and generating human-like text,\ncombined with its ability to effectively interpret and pro-\nduce natural language, makes it well-suited for complex\nNLP tasks.

Pretrained Large Multimodal Models\nWe build upon pre-trained Large Multimodal Models\n(LMMs) to generate image-question-answer triplets as\ninstruction-tuning datasets to train smaller multimodal mod-\nels (SMMs) through vision-language instruction tuning.\nThis knowledge transfer, or distillation, from LMMs accel-\nerates and enhances SMMs' learning, ultimately leading to\nmore accurate, relevant, and contextually-aware responses\nin tasks demanding comprehension of both visual and lin-\nguistic inputs, such as zero-shot VQA and image captioning\nfor electron microscopy images analysis. We utilize Ope-\nnAI's state-of-the-art multimodal model, GPT-4 Turbo with\nVision (GPT-4-vision-preview), which surpasses the limita-\ntions of its predecessors, to efficiently generate high-quality\ntraining data for instruction tuning SMMs. This allows\nSMMs to generalize well to new, unseen questions. GPT-4\nTurbo boasts a significantly expanded context window of\n128k tokens (\u2248 300 pages per prompt), a 3x reduction in\ninput token cost, a 2x reduction in output token cost, and a\nmaximum output length of 4096 tokens for more elaborate\ntext generation. The GPT-4 Turbo with Vision API, accessi-\nble through Multimodal Modeling as a Service (MMaaS),\naccepts both image and text inputs to generate multimodal\noutputs.

These insights\nhelps to generate diverse multimodal instruction-following\ndata, vital for training SMMs to generalize well on electron\nmicroscopy image analysis tasks.\nA.4. Multimodal Instruction-Following Data\nThe generation of high-quality, diverse, and task-specific\nmultimodal instruction-following data using GPT-4 Turbo\nwith Vision is a powerful approach for training versatile,\nmore efficient, and smaller multimodal models for VQA and\nimage-captioning on microscopic image analysis tasks. This\napproach offers several benefits, including: (a) Enhancing\nmodel capabilities: GPT-4 Turbo with Vision's, owing to\nits vast pre-training knowledge can generate questions that\ncomprehensively investigate diverse facets of nanomaterials\nunderlying electron micrographs, including size, distribu-\ntion, morphology, and structure. These questions are more\ncomplex, nuanced, and require reasoning and knowledge be-\nyond basic image recognition. This can expand the limits of\nwhat smaller multimodal models can learn and enable them\nto answer more challenging visual questions about these\nmicroscopic images. (b) Improving zero-shot learning:\nTraining smaller models on diverse questions and answers\nfosters deeper insights into the relationships between vi-\nsual features, language, and task objectives. This enhances\ntheir ability to answer new questions on unseen microscopic\nimages without further training, a critical element for prac-\ntical applications. (c) Facilitating knowledge distillation:\nGPT-4 Turbo with Vision can generate detailed, nuanced\nquestion-answer pairs that describe microscopic images,\nincluding their visual properties such as shape, texture, pat-\nterns, and surface characteristics. Furthermore, it can draw\nconnections to size, distribution, morphology, and structural\nrelationships, leveraging its extensive internal knowledge\nacquired during pre-training. This facilitates knowledge\ndistillation, transferring valuable task-specific knowledge\nfrom larger to smaller models. As a result, smaller models\nbecome more efficient, accurate, and transparent in their\nreasoning since they don't need to learn everything from\nscratch with expensive human-annotated datasets. (d) Gen-\nerating diverse question-answer pairs: Finally, the end-\nuser queries can be used to generate diverse question-answer\npairs that delve into various aspects, properties, and char-\nacteristics of microscopic images. This further enriches\nthe training data for smaller models, equipping them to\nhandle a wider range of end-user queries. Our approach\nleverages the power of zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting to guide large multimodal models (LMMs) like"}]}

{"title": "Lexicography Saves Lives (LSL): Automatically Translating Suicide-Related Language", "authors": ["Annika Marie Schoene", "John E. Ortega", "Rodolfo Joel Zevallos", "Laura Haaber Ihle"], "abstract": "Recent years have seen a marked increase in research that aims to identify or predict risk, intention or ideation of suicide. The majority of new tasks, datasets, language models and other resources focus on English and on suicide in the context of Western culture. However, suicide is global issue and reducing suicide rate by 2030 is one of the key goals of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals\u00b9. Previous work has used English dictionaries related to suicide to translate into different target languages due to lack of other available resources. Naturally, this leads to a variety of ethical tensions (e.g.: linguistic misrepresentation), where discourse around suicide is not present in a particular culture or country. In this work, we introduce the 'Lexicography Saves Lives Project' to address this issue and make three distinct contributions. First, we outline ethical consideration and provide overview guidelines to mitigate harm in developing suicide-related resources. Next, we translate an existing dictionary related to suicidal ideation into 200 different languages and conduct human evaluations on a subset of translated dictionaries. Finally, we introduce a public website to make our resources available and enable community participation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Each year more than 700,000 people die by suicide worldwide (Organization et al., 2021), where for each suicide there are many more attempts2 and often numbers are underestimated due to under-reporting or misclassification (Snowdon and Choi, 2020). There are multiple factors at play that contribute, which include but are not limited to (i) social stigma, (ii) cultural and/or (iii) legal concerns (Dattani et al., 2023). There are a variety of efforts that focus on developing new prevention, screening and risk identification strategies to reduce suicide rates not only from the medical, public health and policy community (Morrow et al., 2022; Little et al., 2016; Denneson et al., 2016), but also from Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) community (Kim et al., 2023; Badal and Depp, 2022; McCoy et al., 2016). One area of this work focuses on detecting suicidal risk, intent or ideation from social media (Coppersmith et al., 2015; Du et al., 2018; Schoene et al., 2023) by utilizing keyword detection approaches based on dictionaries (Sinha et al., 2019; Ji et al., 2020). However, the vast majority of this work are developed in English and for a western culture, where fewer resources exist in other languages and close to none in low-resource languages. This lack of resources has spurred efforts to automatically translate existing dictionary resources from English and Chinese to Korean (Lee et al., 2020) to predict suicidality. Despite some success of such approaches, there are still a number of challenges that limit the usefulness where automatic translations often don't take cultural context or linguistic differences into account (Ortega and Church, 2023). For example, when translating from English to German the phrase 'my suicide letter' is translated into \u2018Mein Selbstmordbrief'. Whilst this is a grammatical correct translation, the phrase itself would be rarely if at all used in German and a more commonly used phrase would be 'Mein Abschiedsbrief'. Similarly, there may be words and phrases in a target language that do not exist in the source language and therefore would be missing in the final translated dictionary. This also raises a set of linguistic and ethical concerns, such as the consequences of designing automatic suicide ideation detection resources/tools and their usefulness in practice. Despite these challenges, the potential use of machine translation in the detection of suicide cases is a field that deserves further investigation and careful approaches, as it could offer an additional"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Detecting suicide-related language Detection methods for suicidal intent, ideation or risk based on machine learning have evolved significantly over the past decades, and various techniques have been employed to enhance model accuracy. Traditionally, feature engineering has been a crucial component of these methods, where features extracted from text using dictionaries play a pivotal role in training machine learning models Sarsam et al. (2021); Birjali et al. (2017); Abboute et al. (2014); Okhapkina et al. (2017); Ji et al. (2022). Our efforts are closely related to previous work that investigated methods and resources for suicide ideation detection. Collecting annotated data for mental health related tasks is notoriously difficult and suicidal ideation is no exception. Work in this area usually relies on self-reports (Coppersmith et al., 2015), heuristics based on the presence of specific keywords (Du et al., 2018) and phrases or words (Burnap et al., 2017; Coppersmith et al., 2015) in lexicons Sawhney et al. (2018). More specifically, lexicons have typically been developed in collaboration with or by domain experts (Gaur et al., 2019), but more recently computational methods have been used generate new lexicons using social media data (Lee et al., 2022; Lv et al., 2015). However, the vast majority of research focuses on developing new datasets, resources (e.g.: language models, lexicons) and tasks only in English (Du et al., 2018; Schoene et al., 2023; Mishra et al., 2019; Sawhney et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2019). Some existing work in languages other than English often focus on high-resource languages such as Spanish (Valeriano et al., 2020; Ram\u00edrez-Cifuentes et al., 2020), Arabic (Hassib et al., 2022; Benlaaraj et al., 2022) or Chinese (Huang et al., 2014; Lv et al., 2015) or and very few investigate low-resource languages (e.g.: Filipino or Taglish (Astoveza et al., 2018)). Other work (Moslem et al., 2023) focused on the use of adaptive machine translation to create translations for domain-specific text in low-resource languages like Kinyarwanda. They showed that generation tools such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) and Bloom (Davis, 2023) were inadequate when for domain-specific text in low-resource situations. Lastly, Lewis et al. (2011) provided a cookbook for MT in crisis situations. Their work could be a good guide to consider when translating texts such"}, {"title": "Ethical considerations for Mental Health and Suicide", "content": "Ethics are another critical concern when considering the implementation of suicide detection systems based on machine translation. People's privacy must be rigorously protected, and any approach in this regard should take into account the ethical implications of online surveillance, the collection of sensitive data, and impact of peoples health. In the past, a few efforts have been made to raise awareness around ethical tensions and issues around online suicide prevention tools, methods and approaches (Orr et al., 2022). The majority of existing work in this space has investigated and reviewed existing apps, products or platforms that are already in use (Gomes de Andrade et al., 2018; Martinengo et al., 2019; Larsen et al., 2015; Jha et al., 2023; Braciszewski, 2021) and much of existing recommendations have been based on practical experience rather than foundational work in bioethics or AI ethics. To the best of our knowledge there has been no effort focused on settings where MT systems are used to automatically translate suicide-related language and has taken into considerations linguistic and cultural factors."}, {"title": "subsectionLinguistic Imbalance and Misrepresentation", "content": "Ethical concerns arise from the imbalance between various languages and language groups or from underlying, but often unarticulated, assumptions about what language is and how it functions."}, {"title": "Imbalances", "content": "There is an inherit imbalance between high-resource languages and low-resource languages (Ortega and Church, 2023). For example, some languages are far better represented in data sources due to the number of speakers of said language or tech imperialism (Kwet, 2019), and therefore provide a much stronger source for training. This ultimately results in better functioning tools within those language groups. In contrast, low-resource languages are often limited by the size of the data sources, which can result in lower functionality of the finished tool for those language groups. An unintended consequence of this problem is that high-resource language speakers will be better served by the tools developed, while communities who belong to the low-resource language speakers will be under-served, resulting in an obvious distributive injustice, especially if speakers of low-resource languages will still be subjected to the tools, but the tools will be less efficient on such language speakers."}, {"title": "Misrepresentation", "content": "poses a risk of low functionality in suicide ideation detection tools in low-resource languages. This can occur when a high-resource language forms the only basis of inquiry, against which all other translations are made. For example, one can imagine a simplistic approach to multilingual suicide ideation detection, where English is used as a starting point to identify words related to death and suicide. The list of words is then translated into a variety of low-resource languages, and the results are used to form the basis of the automated suicide ideation detection tools without human intervention. The linguistic misrepresentation will follow from an underlying assumption about what language is and how it functions. Namely that words in language refer to objects or strictly defined concepts in the world and that the meaning of each word follows directly from the object/concept it refers to. If that was the case, it would indeed be possible to simply translate the list from one language to another and obtain a well functioning output. However, a distinction made in philosophy of language may assist in establishing why this understanding is problematic. This distinction is between meaning and reference (Putnam, 1981), where the reference of a word to refer to the object it points to, but the meaning of the word to refer to the intention behind the word (Speaks, 2010; Frege, 1892; Wittgenstein, 2010; Russell, 1905)."}, {"title": "", "content": "Therefore, if multilingual datasets are developed merely by translating words from a high-resource language to a range of low-resource languages, with no other additional initiatives, the result will be a list of words that reference death and suicide. However, it will not encompass the linguistic meaning of suicide and death in each of the languages to which the translation is made. This becomes evident when one considers how many of the common expressions concerning death or suicide that are perfectly meaningful to language users, but do not contain any reference to death or suicide at all; the English phrase \u2018to kick the bucket', has the Danish version 'at stille tr\u00e6skoene\u201d (to put down the wooden clogs)', and the Turkish \u2018nallari dikmek\u201d"}, {"title": "", "content": "(to put up the horseshoes)'. Without a thorough understanding of the fact that a large part of the linguistic meaning we establish when talking about suicide or death are purely metaphorical, allegorical, context dependent, and deeply local to language users, suicide ideation tools will never catch the myriads of ways we meaningfully talk about those topics, and therefore never be as efficient as they could be. The ethical effect of this linguistic misrepresentation - a type of representational injustice -is also distributive injustice (Zalta et al., 1995), because the tool will have lower precision and functionality in low-resource languages, where attention to how death and suicide are encompassed in language has merely been replaced with a checklist of the words that correspond to those in the high resource language used as the baseline."}, {"title": "2.0.1 Mitigation strategies", "content": "There are various ways to mitigate the aforementioned risks, which include but are not limited to (i) paying close attention to the quality and size of data sources, securing as balanced an approach as possible and (ii) letting each language speak for itself in its respective cultural contexts. It is critical, that local speakers of all languages, but especially low-resource languages are actively included in the translation process, not merely to check if the automated translations make sense, but to add words and phrases from their own language that relate to death and suicide, and to delete those automatically generated translations that are not meaningful in their language. The importance of integrating a strong cultural context becomes clear, when one understands that meaning in language arises through the exact, specific context of each language: To put down the wooden clogs, stems from a time when all Danes were farmers and only had one pair of shoes and putting them down meant one was dead (Tangherlini, 2013). Meaning in language does not merely stem from their reference to objects in the world (Wittgenstein, 2010), and for that reason only local language speakers have the authority to define language about death and suicide in their language group. An under-representation of language is an under-representation of the cultural context, in which that language exists. It is evident that even within a particular language group there are linguistic variations and the potential for under-representation of specific sub-groups. For that reason, one should aim for as broad a group of collaborators as possible, within each language group."}, {"title": "2.1 Design, Autonomy and Justice", "content": "Design Both the design and implementation of suicide prevention tools demand a thorough focus on ethics and on the potential implications the technologies in question may have on those who are subjected to them. This requires a theoretically founded and methodological approach to ethics, where foundational work in bioethics (Beauchamp et al., 2008; of Health et al., 2016) and AI ethics (Floridi et al., 2021; Canca, 2020) can provide valuable insights. Even when tools are designed with good intention and the aim to help and protect the most vulnerable, they also have the potential to cause harm or wrongdoing to that same group. This should always be acknowledged by those with the power to develop and implement such tools, and all measures should be taken to ensure that no harm comes to those who are most vulnerable to it. Even if this leads to not implementing the tool is the least potentially harmful path forward. This is especially important in settings, where tech-based initiatives (e.g.: platforms, apps etc.) do not not fall under the scope of binding regulations or organization-ally enforced ethical procedures (Celedonia et al., 2021). In fact, no such guidelines are necessarily developed or implemented. Nor does developing (or implementing) suicide prevention tools demand any professional training in mental health or health care in general. In the worst case, this can result in a setting where expertise is low, ethical concerns are overlooked or missing and the output actively targets the most vulnerable."}, {"title": "Autonomy", "content": "A clear and available introduction to how the tools function should be available to everyone subjected to them, just as it should be possible to inquire about the basis on which they reached specific conclusions. Individuals should be clearly informed about the use of suicide ideation detection tools and should explicitly consent to being subjected to them. To ensure individual autonomy, and due to the potentially severe stigmatization of subjects and the risk of unjust representation in the case of false positives, the utmost care should be given to designing any tools that aim to detect suicide ideation, intent or risk. Any tools developed to prevent suicide require close monitoring of personal data to function, and thus entails a potentially severe privacy violation. This trade off between"}, {"title": "Justice", "content": "It is vital, to ensure that any resources or tools are subjected to ongoing bias and fairness audits, so as to avoid that the potential burdens of the system (false positives) are not disproportionately distributed on particular groups or individuals, but equally distributed across the population. This is especially important in this context, because of the potentially stigmatizing effect of false positives and the emotional harm they may incur. Furthermore, it is essential to ensure that local regulatory and cultural contexts around suicide are taken into consideration. In 25 countries, not only suicide, but suicide attempts are illegal and for example, in the Bahamas, it is punished with life imprisonment (Mishara and Weisstub, 2016). In such a setting, a suicide prevention tool can become an instrument of power, surveilling citizens for signs of criminal behavior. Therefore, the potential positive effects of suicide prevention tools can outweigh the negative effects and careful measures should be taken prior to development. Overall, it is crucial to establish strong ethics practices, clear procedures for complying with them, and processes for documenting that compliance. As the tools in question develop over time, this requires an ongoing involvement with their ethical implications and a thorough integration of ethics into all stages of the development and deployment process, from research, to design, development and deployment. This paper does not offer such an extensive ethics framework, but rather provides an overview guidance on the ethical risks involved in designing, developing, and deploying suicide prevention tools, and to clarify the scope of potential ethical pitfalls, when it comes to developing new resources."}, {"title": "3 Automatic translation", "content": "The original lexicon containing words and phrases related to suicidal ideation was proposed by O'dea et al.

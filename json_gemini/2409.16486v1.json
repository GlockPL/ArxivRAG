{"title": "To Explore the Potential Inhibitors against Multi-target Proteins of COVID-19 using In-Silico Study", "authors": ["Imra Aqeel"], "abstract": "The global pandemic due to emergence of COVID-19 has created the unrivaled public\u2013c health crisis. It has huge morbidity rate never comprehended in the recent decades. Researchers have made many efforts to find the optimal solution of this pandemic. Progressively, drug repurposing is an emergent and powerful strategy with saving cost, time, and labor. Lacking of identified repurposed drug candidates against COVID-19 demands more efforts to explore the potential inhibitors for effective cure. In this study, we used the combination of molecular docking and machine learning regression approaches to explore the potential inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19. The 5903 approved drugs from ZINC database, have screened against the multi-target proteins of COVID-19 including Spike (S), main protease 3CL (3CLpro), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These proteins are responsible for binding of virons with host cell receptors, replicating the virus, and wrapping the virus RNA into a helical symmetrical structure. We calculated the binding affinities of these drugs to multi-target proteins using molecular docking process. We perform the QSAR modeling by employing various machine learning regression approaches to identify the potential inhibitors against COVID-19. Our findings with best scores of R\u00b2 and RMSE demonstrated that our proposed Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model is the most appropriate model to explore the potential inhibitors. We proposed five novel promising inhibitors with their respective Zinc IDs ZINC (3873365, 85432544, 8214470, 85536956, and 261494640) within the range of -19.7 kcal/mol to -12.6 kcal/mol. We further analyzed the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of these most potent inhibitors to examine their behavior. The analysis of these properties is the key factor to promote an effective cure for public health. Our work constructs an efficient structure with which to probe the potential inhibitors against COVID-19, creating the combination of molecular docking with machine learning regression approaches. Our findings contribute to the larger goal of finding effective cures for COVID-19, which is the acute global health challenge. Our research provides a foundation for improving the future response to viral threats and assists in managing the current pandemic and projecting future public health measures.", "sections": [{"title": "1- Introduction", "content": "According to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, as of July 10, 2024, there were over 704.75 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and over 7.01 million deaths from the virus. This has created an unparalleled global health emergency. The respiratory tract infections caused by the causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), range in severity from subclinical and mild common cold-like symptoms to fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single positive-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family [1]. SARS-CoV-2 attacks airway epithelium cells and is spread via aerosol. The severity of the disease has decreased as a result of vaccination campaigns and rising public immunity [2]. Nonetheless, the range of drugs available for COVID-19 treatment and prevention is restricted. Furthermore, there is still much to learn about the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nEven while vaccinations have helped contain the Covid-19 outbreak, their full efficacy depends on herd immunity, a communal endeavor at odds with the population's well-known vaccine hesitation [3]. Furthermore, finding efficient antivirals is a top priority due to the virus's quick mutation, diminishing immunity, and expensive vaccination. Currently, there are few antivirals that are approved under emergency authorization but have low effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 replication. The first approved antiviral remdesivir, [4] has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity with RNA polymerase inhibitor. It can only be used to treat a restricted number of hospitalized patients and requires parenteral administration. Oral nucleotide analog molnupiravir [5] has a broad-spectrum antiviral action and is used clinically in individuals with mild to moderate Covid-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. Lastly, the most popular paxlovid consists of a combination of ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and nimatrelvir, the primary protease inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to suppressing host or viral proteases or RNA synthesis, other methods for disrupting the coronavirus life cycle include stopping the virus's entry into cells through the ACE2 receptor, preventing the assembly of new viral particles, and obstructing the virus's uptake pathway. Modulating inflammatory pathways can also have an impact on the infection's outcome [6] [7]. Other already promoted antivirals like lopinavir or ritonavir finally shown fruitless to treat the disease [8].\nThe reasons listed above highlight the necessity of creating targeted antiviral treatments in the near future to combat SARS-CoV-2. However, the protracted process of developing new medications makes this urgency lessened [9]. Because drugs have well-established pharmacological qualities, repurposing them can assist reduce the time it takes to introduce a medicine into the clinic [10]. Conversely, the use of computational approaches can aid in the direction of discovery activities, saving money by eliminating the need for expensive trial and error procedures involving living systems, biochemical screening, and cell cultures [11]. For instance, baricitinib, a medication for rheumatoid arthritis, was repurposed using artificial intelligence approaches to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections [12]. This medication has been demonstrated to shorten recovery times and hasten the improvement of clinical status in Covid-19 patients when taken in conjunction with remdesivir [13].\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor has to attach to the host cell, and this is seen by an extremely glycosylated envelope protein known as spike or S protein that is used by both SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV [14] [15]. The S1 and S2 subunits combined to form the S protein. The earlier of which is used to bind to the ACE2 receptor and the latter of which intricate in cell infection and membrane fusion, triggered by the serine protease TMPRSS2 [16] [17]. Additionally, the receptor binding domain (RBD), is encoded by the S1 subunit, is essential to attach to the ACE2 peptidase domain and it is the primary target of deactivating the antibodies produced during infection. [18][19].\nThe other viral protein of SARS-COV-2 is nucleocapsid (N) protein which is vital to the coronavirus life cycle and involved in numerous crucial activities after virus incursion. It identifies and surrounds the viral RNA forming a helical symmetrical structure that plays essential multiple function in the life cycle of coronavirus [20]. It attaches itself to the virus's genomic RNA to create a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) [21]. It has garnered a lot of interest in the creation of drugs and vaccines.\nSARS-CoV-2 requires a variety of viral proteins to aid in its reproduction, but one of these proteins - the main protease 3CLpro, also known as main protease (Mpro), is essential for cleaving viral polyproteins into the functional non-structural proteins required for viral replication [22]. Due to its importance in the viral life cycle, 3CLpro is now being considered as a possible target for COVID-19 antiviral treatment development. The homodimeric cysteine protease 3CL protease is a desirable option for the creation of protease inhibitors due to the catalytic dyad of His41 and Cys145 [23]. Numerous investigations have documented the accomplishment of pinpointing peptides and tiny compounds that can potently impede the 3CL protease's activity in vitro [24]. The creation of precise and effective 3CL protease inhibitors is still a difficult task.\nHowever, the complexity and fast evolution of the disease pose huge challenges in identifying promising repurposed drugs as a potential treatment for COVID-19. For example, molecular docking [25] is one of the computational approaches that has proved to be informative on potential drug candidates in the identification of possible drug candidates because it allows quick screening of large compound numbers against specific targets, producing valuable information regarding their potential efficacy and binding interactions. These types of studies open possibilities on the identification of computationally obtained compounds as new drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, but they also highlight the need for a machine learning-based framework to speed up the process.\nIn this paper, we outline our strategy for investigating Covid-19 infection inhibitors through the establishment of a molecular docking and drug screening machine learning study. We present the findings of a virtual screening investigation aimed at detecting hits that bind to SARS-CoV-2 multi-proteins, S, N, and Mpro, which inhibit entry and viral engagement. A virtual screening was conducted with the Zinc database of authorized medications. The machine learning QSAR modeling and molecular docking were considered in the computational process. The autodock vina software [26] was utilized to conduct molecular docking studies based on the various structures that were found. Using ever stricter computational criteria, the molecular docking data were sifted via a virtual screening process that resulted in the reduction of the original set of 5903 compounds to a final list of 5537 molecules. After evaluating the top five hits in silico for their possible ability to impede the Covid-19 interaction, a shortlist of 05 compounds is created. Our goal was to identify inhibitors that are selective and concentrate on particular interactions that enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 multi-targeted proteins.\nIn our proposed study, to create a more effective method of estimating binding affinities towards the multi-targeted proteins of Covid-19, we employed QSAR modeling with multiple ML techniques. Several regression models, including Decision Tree regression (DTR), Gradient Boosting regression (GBR), Extra Trees regression (ETR), K-Nearest Neighbor regression (KNNR), Multi-Layer Perceptron regression (MLPR), and XGBoost regression (XGBR), are constructed and trained using MACCS fingerprint feature descriptor type\u2014that is computed using the PaDEL descriptor program [27]. To enhance the performance of regression models, the input dataset is split into two sections, with 80% of the internal dataset being used for 5-fold cross validation. To test these models, an external dataset including the remaining 20% of the data is employed. R\u00b2 and RMSE are statistical measurements that are used to evaluate the simulated outcomes of regression models.

Next, using the crucial statistical metrics of R2 and RMSE, compare its performance with a number of QSAR models. The outcomes of the approved drugs' molecular docking studies and their interactions with multi-target proteins will next be discussed. In order to determine the drugs' safety and effectiveness towards the multi-target proteins, we will lastly perform a physiochemical investigation of the drug compounds that made the short list."}, {"title": "2.1.

A detailed explanation of the 4639 drug compounds used in the development of the model may be found in section 3.2.1. As mentioned in section 3.2.2, two different feature sets are utilized to assess the performance of the proposed model: fingerprint features are inserted into the X matrix to create the data matrices, and their matching binding affinities are placed in the Y matrix. The dataset is split into two parts: an internal dataset, which makes up 80% of the total, and an external dataset, which makes up 20%. We trained and validated the model based on an internal dataset using 5-fold cross validation, and now we assess the performance of the model on the external dataset.\nWe utilize R\u00b2 and RMSE, two widely recognized statistical measures, to evaluate the effectiveness of our suggested QSAR model. R2 measures the degree to which the independent variables (features) account for the variation in the dependent variable (binding affinity) and assesses the model's fitness. Higher values indicate greater model performance; the range is 0 to 1. On the other hand, the relative error between the actual and predicted values of binding affinity is measured by RMSE.

Targeting the Spike, 3CLpro, and Nucleocapsid Proteins", "content": "The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, 3CLpro (main protease, also called Mpro), and nucleocapsid protein are vital targets for therapeutic research because they are essential to the virus's capacity to infect, reproduce, and assemble inside host cells. The virus's glycoprotein Spike protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of host cells to mediate viral entrance. The two subunits that make up this complex are S1, which has the receptor-binding domain (RBD) necessary for binding to ACE2, and S2, which promotes membrane fusion and lets viral RNA into the host cell. This treatment or vaccine could, therefore, place an end to the infection even before it initiates by blocking the virus from attaching and invading human cells. Many COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies that attempt to neutralize the virus are founded on this concept. Additionally, since mutations of the Spike protein correlate with changes in the transmissibility and immune evasion capabilities of the virus, targeting this protein might offer protection against other SARS-CoV-2 strains.\nThe SARS-Cov-2 protease enzyme 3CLpro catalyzes the processing of polyproteins from the viral RNA for generating functional proteins needed to replicate and assemble the viruses. Inhibition of the activity of the 3CLpro enzyme interrupts the replication cycle of the virus. New virions must also be generated for the production of viral proteins. Since 3CLpro is a protein exclusive to the virus and does not have any counterpart in humans, drugs that target this protein are likely to be very specific and may have fewer side effects on the host. Additionally, because this family of viruses has very similar proteases, drugs targeting 3CLpro may also offer broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against other members of the coronaviruses.\nAnother important SARS-CoV-2 component is the nucleocapsid protein, a protein that interacts with the viral RNA genome in creating a ribonucleoprotein complex. This complex is essential both during the virus's packaging and during its replication. The drugs may limit the reproduction of viruses and proliferation if they cause the disruption of the ability of the virus to properly package its RNA or build new virions by targeting the nucleocapsid protein. Further, the nucleocapsid protein plays an important role in regulating the host's immune response and its inhibition may enhance the host's immunological power to counter the virus. Since it is less prone to mutation compared with Spike protein, this protein acts as a stable target for the synthesis of antiviral drugs. In addition, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 involves the Spike, 3CLpro, and nucleocapsid protein. These proteins also show promise as therapeutic targets for blocking the virus and halting the development of COVID-19."}, {"title": "3.1.2.

Feature Extraction", "content": "A vector of fingerprint descriptors represented molecular components of drug compound. Before the calculation of descriptors, a built-in PaDEL- Descriptor tool [27] was applied for standardization of tautomer and desalting. Here in the current investigation, MACCS fingerprint descriptor was used to predict the binding affinities of drug molecules. The MACCS fingerprint encodes structural characteristics of the chemical compounds in a compressed and highly understandable form, so it is particularly useful for predicting binding affinity in the drug discovery process. It gives a binary, yes or no, whether certain substructures, such as functional groups, rings, or types of bond are present within a molecule or not. MACCS fingerprints allow for the efficient comparison of similarities between a query molecule and known ligands with established binding profiles in the prediction of binding affinity. We can find compounds that share structural properties with ligands known to bind efficiently to a particular target protein by comparing these fingerprints with similarity metrics.\nThe similar binding behavior of molecules with great structural similarity makes this similarity-based approach a useful proxy for estimating binding affinity. MACCS fingerprint, which allows the comparison to be carried out rapidly and, therefore particularly useful for virtual screening provides the ability to analyze vast chemical libraries to try and find potential candidates with favorable binding affinities. Additionally, by clustering compounds based on their MACCS fingerprints, those can be grouped that might interact with similar targets, streamlining the selection of candidates for more detailed experimental validation. While MACCS fingerprints provide an efficient way to identify potential binders."}, {"title": "3.2.3. Decision Tree Regression (DTR) Model", "content": "The aim of the work was to develop regression models which could predict the continuous response variable that is, binding affinity with high accuracy using several predictor factors including fingerprint descriptors. Several machine learning techniques are created for QSAR modeling in order to accomplish this goal. Because it performs better in predictions than the other models, the DTR approach is preferred. One kind of predictive model used in machine learning is called a decision tree-based predictive model, or DTR [34]. A decision tree, sometimes called a classification tree or regression tree, is also known as a graphical model, which itself could resemble a flow chart, having nodes or bubbles, branches, and leaves. The interior nodes of the decision tree each represent a test for a particular attribute; the branch shows the test's outcome, and each leaf node shows a prediction or class label. For a DTR, the value of a leaf node is the continuous value, such as the mean or the median of target values in training samples associated with the same leaf node. In DTR, feature space is divided into subsets recursively based on the optimization of the feature space to minimize the variance reduction of the target variable. This procedure keeps going till the halting requirement is satisfied. Its interpretability, resistance to over-fitting, and capacity to manage non-linear interactions between the features and the target variable are only a few of its benefits.\nAs mentioned in section 3.2.1, the input dataset contains 4639 drug compounds in total. This dataset has an 80:20 ratio between its internal and external datasets. Using 5-fold cross validation, the model's performance is robust and trained using the internal dataset. MACCS fingerprint molecular descriptor, which is described in section 3.2.2, is employed as the feature set for this purpose. The model's performance is evaluated using the external dataset.\nIn the following evaluation, the working of the resulting regression models is measured based on the two statistical measures: the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The value of R\u00b2 measures the fraction of variance in the dependent variable which the independent variables can explain. A value of 1 implies a perfect fit, whereas a value of 0 can be considered a bad fit. However, RMSE offers a measurement of the prediction model's relative inaccuracy. A comparison study is performed in order to evaluate the performance of several regression models. We used MACCS fingerprint as the feature set for the comparative analysis."}, {"title": "3.3.

Molecular Docking Analysis", "content": "In molecular docking analysis using AutoDock Vina, the process begins by providing the protein structure and ligand, which are used to predict the most favorable binding orientations and interactions within the protein's active site. The primary result of this analysis is the calculation of binding affinity, expressed as the free energy change (AG) in kcal/mol. Lower binding energy values signify stronger and more stable ligand-protein interactions, with the pose displaying the lowest energy generally considered the optimal binding mode. In order to determine how the ligand interacts with the protein's active site, AutoDock Vina generates several binding poses for the ligand, which are then ordered according to their energy scores. Usually, the top-ranked poses are investigated.\nIn addition, the consistency of projected ligand poses in relation to a reference structure or experimentally acquired data is evaluated by computing the root mean square deviation (RMSD), where lower RMSD values denote more trustworthy docking predictions.\nAt this point, by showing how the ligand fits into the active site and interacts with the residues around it, visualization of the binding site contributes to a more profound understanding of the subject matter. This stage helps determine the orientation of the ligand and possible binding pockets. Such is the ability of the AutoDock Vina scoring tool that its docking findings can be ranked according to their binding affinities, and it is therefore possible to select the best position for further investigation.

Drug Analysis", "content": "While contemplating drug repurposing by using in silico research to understand whether licensed drugs might be used for novel therapeutic uses, a thorough physicochemical evaluation is required. Such factors are crucial in defining the drug's permeability, solubility, bioavailability, and general pharmacokinetic behavior. Among the common physicochemical factors analyzed is molecular weight, which influences the general absorption profile of the drug and its ability to cross biological membranes. The affinity of the drug for the lipid versus the aqueous environment, or lipophilicity is also indicated as log P, and impacts its solubility and distribution. The count of HBD and HBA determine the aqueous solubility of the drug and its ability to interact with the biological target.\nSome examples of such additional features that explain the structural complexity of the drug and its ability to be involved in hydrophobic interactions include the existence of rings and the presence of heavy atoms. Knowledge of heteroatoms, which are atoms other than carbon and hydrogen, gives an understanding of the drug's ability to engage in hydrogen bonding and other electrostatic interactions. The proportion of sp3 hybridized carbons (SP3) is ultimately analyzed to estimate the three-dimensionality of drugs and their possible impact on binding affinity and metabolic stability.

However, due to the non- linear acoustic responses of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE, multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Achieving effective sound insulation in environments that require ventilation has been a longstanding challenge in the field of acoustics. To attain a high level of soundproofing, it is generally essential to physically block any gaps and openings that could allow sound waves to pass through and transmit acoustic energy. However, when ventilation is required, traditional soundproofing methods can lead to the deterioration of the ventilation system. This trade-off between sound insulation and ventilation has been observed in various sound-blocking apparatuses, such as vehicle mufflers [1-3], acoustic vents [4-6], and acoustic windows [7-10]. To address this challenge, acoustic metamaterials (AMs) have been proposed as a solution. AMs consist of sub-wavelength elements arranged in a repeating pattern. Such structures are designed to have extraordinary acoustic properties, such as zero/extreme/negative density [11- 13] or negative bulk modulus [14-16], which enable them to control sound waves in ways that were previously considered impossible. Moreover, by utilizing these properties, they can be employed in open spaces to facilitate airflow, allowing the simultaneous control of mass transportation and acoustic energy. Among these designs, the ventilated acoustic resonator (VAR) has gained considerable attention owing to its simple design and adaptability to various shapes [17-22]. A VAR consists of two parts: a waveguide and a Helmholtz resonator. Because the waveguide allows fluid to flow and the Helmholtz resonator blocks noise, both mass transportation and acoustic energy can be controlled. In addition, the geometric parameters of each part can be easily adjusted for ventilation and soundproofing performance, offering a high degree of flexibility in configuring the system to meet specific engineering needs.\nConsidering the wide applications of VAR for sound attenuation, it is necessary to develop an inverse-design technology for VAR structures that reflect the acoustic characteristics of the target application.

Structural Design and Simulation of VAR", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Acoustic Structure", "content": "Figure 1 shows the structures of the proposed axisymmetric VAR that attenuates the sound passing through it. The peak frequency of sound attenuation can be tuned by manipulating the geometric shape of the VAR's cavity. Figure la shows the schematic of a parameterized VAR which is defined by geometric parameters. The training dataset for the inverse design model proposed in this study consists of these parameterized VAR. As a result of our proposed inverse design model, a non-parameterized VAR is created as shown in Figure 1b. Non-parameterized VAR has a similar shape to parameterized VAR but has a non-typical structure that can not be defined with geometric parameters. Figures 1c and d show the acoustic domain of the unit VAR and the cross-section image with the unit VAR's geometric parameters, respectively. The geometric parameters of the VAR were bound to keep the typical T-shape cross-section image represented in Figure 1. The length of the air-fluid channel was fixed at $l_c$ = 20 mm. The range of other design parameters is listed in Table 1. $R, l_b, R_n, l_a, R_c$ represents the radius of the air- fluid channel, neck width of cavity's cross-section, height of cavity neck's cross-section, the width of the cavity, the total radius of VAR's acoustic domain respectively.

The VAE forms a latent space z, a dimension-reduced space, which encodes the probability distribution of the input data x to generate data similar to the input data x. When the VAE is sufficiently trained, the decoder can generate data similar to the input data x by inputting a variable sampled from the latent space z. To implement the data-generating feature of the VAE, training proceeds through the loss function below [54].\n$L(\\\u00d8, \\theta; x) = -E_{q_{\\\u00d8}(z|x)}[log\\{p_{\\theta}(x|z)\\}] + D_{KL}(q_{\\\u00d8}(z|x)||p_{\\theta}(z))$ (3)\nwhere \u00d8 and \u03b8 represents the parameters of the encoder and decoder respectively.

By inputting 100 randomly sampled $z_p$ for each given target acoustic response, 100 VAR candidates with acoustic responses similar to the target acoustic response were generated. Because the images generated by the AR-VAE are blurry, the generated image was converted to a binary image by thresholding. The acoustic response of the generated VAR candidates was evaluated based on the numerical simulation. Among 100 generated VAR candidates, the VAR with the smallest mean squared error (MSE) between the corresponding and target acoustic response was selected as an inverse-design result. We found that 100 sampling of VAR candidates could achieve a sufficiently smaller mean squared error between the corresponding and target acoustic response compared to that of training datasets.

{"title": "Opinion Mining on Offshore Wind Energy for Environmental Engineering", "authors": ["Isabele Bittencourt", "Aparna S. Varde", "Pankaj Lal"], "abstract": "Renewable energy sources are vital to help mitigate the effects of climate change, and reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels, e.g. the state of New Jersey has a goal of producing 100% clean energy by 2050. However, the plans for offshore wind energy by the shore of the state still brings much controversy between residents due to the wind farms' impact on wildlife, coastline, and the people's view from the beaches. In this context, we perform sentiment analysis on social media data to investigate people's opinions and concerns regarding offshore wind energy. We adapt 3 machine learning models, i.e. TextBlob, VADER and SentiWordNet for sentiment analysis because different functions are provided by each model, all of which are useful in our work. Techniques in NLP (natural language processing) are harnessed to gather meaning from the textual data in social media. Data visualization tools are suitably deployed to display the overall results. Despite the controversy surrounding this topic, our findings indicate some positive reception, suggesting potential support for modern-day renewable energy goals. However, there are neutral and negative comments as well, thus potentially helping to find areas for further improvement. The results of this work can be thus useful in a variety of decision-making contexts by governmental organizations and companies, hence aiding and enhancing offshore wind energy policy development. Hence, this work is much in line with citizen science and smart governance via involvement of mass opinion in decision support. In our paper, we highlight the role of sentiment analysis from social media in this aspect.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Renewable energy creates shared value, circular economy approaches and commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). Producing more renewable energy and abandoning conventional sources, such as coal, natural gas and petroleum, is a need shared by all countries in the world, especially as global warming grows more intense. Renewable energy has become more popular over the years; and hence many countries, e.g. the United Kingdom, Germany and China have adopted it as a source of clean energy.\nOffshore wind energy is a type of renewable energy; it is obtained from the use of the force of the wind on the high seas, where it reaches much higher and more constant speed compared to onshore wind, due to the lack of barriers. According to Environmental America [1], the United States has the potential to achieve the production of more than 7,200 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity from offshore wind, which is almost twice the amount of electricity the nation consumed in 2019, and almost 90% of the amount of electricity it would consume in 2050.\nMany regions in the United States are coastal states, such as New Jersey, which makes them an ideal location for offshore wind farms."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Sentiment analysis has surfaced as a very popular method of analyzing mass opinion; and consequently, a significant amount of work has been done on urgent and emerging subjects using machine learning models.\nIn [5], [6] sentiment analysis is used to analyze sentiment towards climate change on Twitter. Sentiment analysis is also performed in [7], where the authors analyze the legitimacy of wind power in Germany using newspaper articles from 2009 to 2018. In [8], sentiment analysis is used for analyzing a large dataset of geo-tagged tweets to investigate the main topics of discussion and sentiment of the population regarding climate change in different countries over time. In [9], the authors perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling on online reviews for policy amendments, showing how air traffic perceptions were impacted by COVID. In [10], opinion mining is used to investigate public reactions towards urban ordinances for smart governance.\nWork has also been conducted towards the policies regarding offshore wind energy to investigate major concerns that were already previously known. In [11], the authors provide an overview of the current development of offshore wind power in different countries, and explore issues around its development. The authors in [12] review three areas that can help with reducing energy consumption, IoT, cloud computing and opinion mining, the latter being significant for its contribution when the aim is to understand feelings and demands from energy consumers and stakeholders to help in the creation of better policies. Additionally, in [13], the authors present an overview of the main issues associated with the economics of offshore wind. In [14], the costs and benefits of offshore wind are discussed relative to onshore wind power and conventional electricity production, with a review of cost estimates."}, {"title": "Data Description", "content": "The data used in this project is gathered mainly from Facebook groups. It has become very common for towns to create groups for discussing topics about their community. We aptly target communities from the NJ coast, e.g. groups from Atlantic City, Ocean City, The Wildwoods and Cape May. We only collect data from publicly accessible groups, so that there are no privacy concerns. We use the Apify web scraper platform [15] to collect and create the dataset.\nWe use standard search engines to find pertinent comments related to the keywords \"offshore wind energy\", \"wind farms\" and \"wind turbines\". A total of 6569 comments are collected, constituting the main source of data in our analysis. Note that we focus our analysis on Facebook posts, however our models and algorithms can be used for other social media sources for opinion mining in related contexts."}, {"title": "Details of Methods", "content": "Our overall approach for sentiment analysis is synopsized with an illustration in Fig. 5. After collecting the data, our first step is preprocessing. We use the Python NLTK (natural language toolkit) library [16] to remove punctuation, html links and stop words, and to perform lemmatization and stemming. It is important to use these preprocessing techniques before analyzing text with sentiment analysis models, in order to discard irrelevant text, e.g. pronouns, articles, that do not add useful meaning to the analysis. The pseudocode for preprocessing can be seen in Algorithm 1.\nOnce the data is preprocessed, we commence the core of the analysis. We deploy the paradigm of sentiment analysis, i.e. a series of methods, techniques and tools used to detect and extract subjective information, such as opinion and attitudes, from language. This paradigm suits our goals of identifying subjective information on offshore wind energy. As is widely known, the recent advances in deep learning and the ability of algorithms to analyze text, have made sentiment analysis improve significantly. Thus, its practice has increased tremendously to gauge mass opinions.\nIn order to perform sentiment analysis on our data, we use 3 models: TextBlob [17], VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary) [18] and SentiWordNet [19], due to their popularity and overall good performance on sentiment classification in the literature, and due to various functionalities provided by these models, all of which are useful in"}, {"title": "Experimental Results", "content": "The sentiment analysis performed in this work shows that the overall sentiment on offshore wind energy seems fairly positive on the whole across all the 3 models, TextBlob, VADER, and SentiWordNet; however, there are many users posting negative and neutral comments as well. All these figures include bar plots and pie plots for at-a-glance visualization of the results derived from each model. Delving deeper into the posts pertaining to the negative and neutral comments can pave the way to identify loopholes in existing policies based on their reception by the masses, thus presenting potential areas for improvement. Likewise, the positive posts can offer the scope for continuation of the respective policies and further encouragement along similar lines."}, {"title": "Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "This work harnesses methods in machine learning and natural language processing to address issues in environmental management, more specifically, clean energy. In particular, offshore wind energy is targeted here, in order to gauge its reception by the masses. Sentiment analysis is performed on social media data, more specifically Facebook posts geo-located in NJ, to investigate people's opinions. The need for renewable sources of energy is high due to the severe effects of climate change on earth. This study provides support to the commitment of producing 100% clean energy by 2050 that is being targeted across many regions in the world today, e.g. in the state of New Jersey here. Although the overall opinion of the population in this dataset is somewhat positive, the neutral and negative counts are not far behind due to concerns over the impacts of offshore wind energy on wildlife and beaches, the state's budget money, etc. Subjectivity scores show that people have a considerable extent of concrete and factual discussions in their social media posts, which is an interesting finding.\nThe results presented here can be used for future decisions by government leaders and interested companies on the topic, i.e. wind farms' location, projects budget, environmental impacts etc. Tailoring policies to public opinion and identifying key concerns are an important part of the process of investing in the build of wind farms by the coast of New Jersey.\nLikewise, similar analyses can be performed on social media posts in other regions to gain deeper insights on the reception of the policies by the common masses. This is in line with paradigms such as citizen science and smart governance that entail active involvement of the masses with more transparency and openness, providing the foundation for more adequate decision-making. Our work in this paper thus makes a modest contribution to these paradigms.\nFuture work emerging from our research includes investigating other sources of text such as online news, corporate and governmental websites, user blogs, and research articles to discover knowledge from text. This can be achieved via machine learning techniques in conjunction with natural language processing. It can include topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), for instance as in [20] where LDA is used to explore climate change, energy and food security trends in newspapers and public documents. It can also entail analyzing more information with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as in [21], where the authors use LLMs for topic modeling and perform quite well. Furthermore, it is possible to map text to structured data to enable the usage of data mining techniques such as association rules for enhanced knowledge discovery. More research on these lines can be conducted in the broad realm of computational linguistics such that it can be useful in studies on the environment.\nIn sum, our paper provides the ground for more work on machine learning and NLP techniques to tackle environmental issues, e.g. in clean energy and related areas. As we move forward towards a greener future, there has been an ample amount of research done towards analysis of environmental topics, deployment of environment-friendly applications, scientific data mining in general, and machine intelligence on the whole [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] much of which focuses on work done in our research group. Hence, our work in this paper is orthogonal to such research. Overall, our study in this paper stands on a notable bridge between computational linguistics and environmental management, helping in the achievement of more sustainable practices for a better and greener world."}]}

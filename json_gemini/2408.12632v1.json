Introduction", "content": "Satellite altimeters have significantly improved our understanding of sea surface height (SSH)\nvariations on a global scale over the past four decades. Accurate investigation of upper ocean\ndynamics relies heavily on satellite altimetry datasets (Fu et al., 2010; MacWilliams 2016; Qiu et\nal., 2017). A critical limitation of nadir-looking altimeters is the presence of large gaps between\nsatellite tracks (Chelton et al., 2011; Rong and Liang 2022). Generally, along-track SSH can\nresolve ocean waves with typical wavelengths down to 70 km, while the spatial resolution in\ntwo-dimensional gridded SSH map is only on the order of 150 km (Qiu et al., 2017, Ballarotta et\nal., 2019), inadequate for diagnosing mesoscale and submesoscale processes with horizontal scales\nless than a few hundred kilometers. Although optimal interpolation, data assimilation, and\nmulti-satellite altimeter data have been utilized to fill the gaps between satellite tracks, the linear\ninterpolation algorithms employed to date still poorly capture the nonlinear relationships between\nirregular along-track observations and gridded two-dimensional SSH maps (Traon et al., 1998;\nDucet et al., 2000; Morrow and Traon 2012; Ubelmann et al., 2015; Fujii et al., 2019; Taburet et\nal., 2019).\nGlobal and regional ocean models have been developed to improve the horizontal resolution of\nSSH maps through downscaling, also referred to as super-resolution in the computer vision field.\nDownscaling through dynamic model simulations is physics-based but comes with substantial\ncomputational cost (Kendon et al., 2010; Gudmundsson et al., 2012). Conversely, traditional\nstatistical downscaling methods reduce computational demands but struggle with unlearned data\nrelationships and distributions (Fowler et al., 2007; Sunyer et al., 2012; Maraun et al., 2017). Deep\nlearning-based methods have emerged as a new paradigm for satellite altimetry data downscaling.\nThis approach is data-driven and often outperforms traditional dynamical and statistical\ndownscaling algorithms (George et al., 2021; Manucharyan et al., 2021; Rong and Liang 2022;\nFablet et al., 2024; Febvre et al., 2024). Recently, generative diffusion models (DMs) have\nbecome a cutting-edge technique for image super-resolution (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021;\nKarras et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2023) and climate downscaling (Addison et al. 2022; Mardani et\nal. 2023; Bischoff and Deck 2024; Ling et al. 2024; Watt and Mansfield 2024).\nThe importance of SSH downscaling stems not only from the sparse horizontal resolution of\nsatellite altimetry datasets but also from the profound impacts of ocean eddies on large-scale"}, {"title": "2. Results", "content": "2.1 Diffusion model-based downscaling using ocean reanalysis\nReanalysis products employ state-of-the-art ocean models incorporating data assimilation schemes\nto produce SSH that closes to observations (Carrassi et al., 2018; Lellouche et al., 2020). We first\ncompare the GLORYS12 reanalysis to AVISO observations (see Methods). AVISO captures\nlarge-scale ocean circulation; however, due to its coarse resolution, ocean eddies with relative\nvorticity comparable to Earth's rotation rate (Ro|> 0.1; see Methods) typically appear on the\nmap as isolated centers (Figs. la and le). In contrast, GLORYS12 well reproduces the observed\nlarge-scale patterns while simulating wavy characteristics and filaments of ocean eddies (Figs. 1b\nand 1f). Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are ubiquitous over the Kuroshio Extension region in\ndaily snapshots. On January 15, 2022, AVISO reveals an array of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies\nwith a southwest-northeast orientation east of landmass (Fig. 1c). While GLORYS12 indeed\nreproduces these observed eddies, it also spuriously generates northwest-southeast oriented\nfilaments that are absent in the observations for that day (Fig. 1d). Similar discrepancies are\nevident on April 1, 2022, where the cyclonic submesoscale eddy simulated by GLORYS12 is\ndisplaced southward (Fig. 1h), inconsistent with AVISO observations (Fig. 1g).\nGiven the aforementioned discrepancies, GLORYS12 can not be treated as the observational"}, {"title": "2.2 Model comparison on the GLORYS12 validation set", "content": "We comprehensively compare KESHDiff against three other models, including bilinear\ninterpolation, super-resolution based on Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN), and U-Net,\nusing the validation set of GLORYS12 (see Methods).

Thus, we utilize KESHDiff to downscale the gridded AVISO SSH from a horizontal resolution\nof 0.25\u00b0 to 1/16\u00b0, achieving a shortest wavelength of approximately 12 km (see Methods). We\ncompare our KESHDiff output with two sets of high-resolution ocean model reanalysis data\nassimilating observations (HYCOM and GLORYS12), the original 0.25\u00b0 low-resolution AVISO\ndata used as input, and multi-satellite along-track observations (see Methods for data descriptions).\nThe comparison period spans from December 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022.\nThe PSD of the along-track observations gradually decreases with shorter wavelengths (Fig. 5a), a\nfeature shown in all datasets. HYCOM data performs the worst, exhibiting significant errors\ncompared to the along-track observations at wavelengths exceeding 300 km (Fig. 5b). Among the\nremaining datasets, the discrepancy between KESHDiff and the along-track observations is\nsmallest (Fig. 5b). Surprisingly, although our training set is derived from GLORYS12, our model\noutperforms GLORYS12 itself when applied to AVISO data. In addition, KESHDiff is also better\nthan the input low-resolution AVISO SSH on large scales. This indicates that ocean reanalysis\nserves as an effective proxy for direct high-resolution SSH observations in the model training step,\ndespite unavailability of the latter.\nAt scales below 300 km, due to the coarse effective resolution, AVISO lacks structures at the\ncorresponding scales, leading to a rapid decline in its PSD (Fig. 5a). Besides, the two model\nreanalyses show consistent declines in PSD compared to KESHDiff. In contrast, KESHDiff\nremains the closest to the along-track observations even at the shortest effective wavelength of 70\nkm (Fig. 5b).\nConsistent with Fig. 1, daily snapshots further demonstrate that KESHDiff has successfully"}, {"title": "2.4 Intensification of eddy variability since 2004", "content": "Based on the output high-resolution SSH data generated by KESHDiff, we focus on the long-term\nchanges in eddy-scale EKE over the Kuroshio Extension region.

Discussion", "content": "Despite significant improvement of satellite observations since the 1980s, the sparse satellite\naltimetry data still limits our understanding of ocean surface eddies. The new Surface Water and\nOcean Topography (SWOT) satellite, launched in late 2022, can directly observe ocean\nsubmesoscale processes (Durand et al., 2010). However, its coverage period is still too short to\ninvestigate historical ocean variability. On the other hand, as an promising method, deep learning\nhas already seen widespread application in the climate and Earth sciences. Studies utilizing\ngenerative diffusion models for SSH downscaling have only emerged recently (Li et al., 2024).\nBased on a state-of-the-art generative diffusion model, we have developed an SSH downscaling\nalgorithm for the Kuroshio Extension region, an ideal test-bed for high-resolution SSH mapping.\nWe refer to this algorithm as KESHDiff.\nKESHDiff displays incredible superiority in SSH downscaling over the Kuroshio Extension\nregion. Firstly, it outperforms current widely-used statistical downscaling and neural\nnetwork-based downscaling algorithms across six evaluation metrics (Fig. 3). Secondly, it exhibits\nexceptional performance on the validation set of high-resolution ocean model reanalysis data, with\nspectral features closely matching model outputs. In addition, when applied to observational\ngrid\n last, using the high-resolution SSH data reconstructed by KESHDiff for 2000-2022, we revealed\na linear intensification trend in EKE over the Kuroshio Extension region at horizontal scales less\nthan 250 km.

While we focuse on the Kuroshio Extension region, data-driven deep learning\ndownscaling algorithms are applicable to any ocean areas, differing with traditional downscaling\nmethods (Martin et al., 2024). Furthermore, deep learning algorithms require less computational\ncost compared to traditional ocean numerical simulations. For instance, the training stage of\nKESHDiff utilized one NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. After training, generating daily high-resolution\nSSH data for one year takes only 3-4 hours. These conclusions do not imply that deep\nlearning-based methods have surpassed traditional ocean models.

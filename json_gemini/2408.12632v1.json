Introduction", "content": "Satellite altimeters have significantly improved our understanding of sea surface height (SSH)\nvariations on a global scale over the past four decades. Accurate investigation of upper ocean\ndynamics relies heavily on satellite altimetry datasets (Fu et al., 2010; MacWilliams 2016; Qiu et\nal., 2017). A critical limitation of nadir-looking altimeters is the presence of large gaps between\nsatellite tracks (Chelton et al., 2011; Rong and Liang 2022). Generally, along-track SSH can\nresolve ocean waves with typical wavelengths down to 70 km, while the spatial resolution in\ntwo-dimensional gridded SSH map is only on the order of 150 km (Qiu et al., 2017, Ballarotta et\nal., 2019), inadequate for diagnosing mesoscale and submesoscale processes with horizontal scales\nless than a few hundred kilometers. Although optimal interpolation, data assimilation, and\nmulti-satellite altimeter data have been utilized to fill the gaps between satellite tracks, the linear\ninterpolation algorithms employed to date still poorly capture the nonlinear relationships between\nirregular along-track observations and gridded two-dimensional SSH maps (Traon et al., 1998;\nDucet et al., 2000; Morrow and Traon 2012; Ubelmann et al., 2015; Fujii et al., 2019; Taburet et\nal., 2019).\nGlobal and regional ocean models have been developed to improve the horizontal resolution of\nSSH maps through downscaling, also referred to as super-resolution in the computer vision field.\nDownscaling through dynamic model simulations is physics-based but comes with substantial\ncomputational cost (Kendon et al., 2010; Gudmundsson et al., 2012). Conversely, traditional\nstatistical downscaling methods reduce computational demands but struggle with unlearned data\nrelationships and distributions (Fowler et al., 2007; Sunyer et al., 2012; Maraun et al., 2017). Deep\nlearning-based methods have emerged as a new paradigm for satellite altimetry data downscaling.\nThis approach is data-driven and often outperforms traditional dynamical and statistical\ndownscaling algorithms (George et al., 2021; Manucharyan et al., 2021; Rong and Liang 2022;\nFablet et al., 2024; Febvre et al., 2024). Recently, generative diffusion models (DMs) have\nbecome a cutting-edge technique for image super-resolution (Ho et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021;\nKarras et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2023) and climate downscaling (Addison et al. 2022; Mardani et\nal. 2023; Bischoff and Deck 2024; Ling et al. 2024; Watt and Mansfield 2024).\nThe importance of SSH downscaling stems not only from the sparse horizontal resolution of\nsatellite altimetry datasets but also from the profound impacts of ocean eddies on large-scale"}, {"title": "2. Results", "content": "2.1 Diffusion model-based downscaling using ocean reanalysis\nReanalysis products employ state-of-the-art ocean models incorporating data assimilation schemes\nto produce SSH that closes to observations (Carrassi et al., 2018; Lellouche et al., 2020). We first\ncompare the GLORYS12 reanalysis to AVISO observations (see Methods). AVISO captures\nlarge-scale ocean circulation; however, due to its coarse resolution, ocean eddies with relative\nvorticity comparable to Earth's rotation rate ($Ro|> 0.1$; see Methods) typically appear on the\nmap as isolated centers (Figs. la and le). In contrast, GLORYS12 well reproduces the observed\nlarge-scale patterns while simulating wavy characteristics and filaments of ocean eddies (Figs. 1b\nand 1f). Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are ubiquitous over the Kuroshio Extension region in\ndaily snapshots. On January 15, 2022, AVISO reveals an array of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies\nwith a southwest-northeast orientation east of landmass (Fig. 1c). While GLORYS12 indeed\nreproduces these observed eddies, it also spuriously generates northwest-southeast oriented\nfilaments that are absent in the observations for that day (Fig. 1d). Similar discrepancies are\nevident on April 1, 2022, where the cyclonic submesoscale eddy simulated by GLORYS12 is\ndisplaced southward (Fig. 1h), inconsistent with AVISO observations (Fig. 1g).\nGiven the aforementioned discrepancies, GLORYS12 can not be treated as the observational"}, {"title": "2.2 Model comparison on the GLORYS12 validation set", "content": "We comprehensively compare KESHDiff against three other models, including bilinear\ninterpolation, super-resolution based on Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN), and U-Net,\nusing the validation set of GLORYS12 (see Methods).

Thus, we utilize KESHDiff to downscale the gridded AVISO SSH from a horizontal resolution\nof 0.25\u00b0 to 1/16\u00b0, achieving a shortest wavelength of approximately 12 km (see Methods). We\ncompare our KESHDiff output with two sets of high-resolution ocean model reanalysis data\nassimilating observations (HYCOM and GLORYS12), the original 0.25\u00b0 low-resolution AVISO\ndata used as input, and multi-satellite along-track observations (see Methods for data descriptions).\nThe comparison period spans from December 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022.\nThe PSD of the along-track observations gradually decreases with shorter wavelengths (Fig. 5a), a\nfeature shown in all datasets. HYCOM data performs the worst, exhibiting significant errors\ncompared to the along-track observations at wavelengths exceeding 300 km (Fig. 5b). Among the\nremaining datasets, the discrepancy between KESHDiff and the along-track observations is\nsmallest (Fig. 5b). Surprisingly, although our training set is derived from GLORYS12, our model\noutperforms GLORYS12 itself when applied to AVISO data. In addition, KESHDiff is also better\nthan the input low-resolution AVISO SSH on large scales. This indicates that ocean reanalysis\nserves as an effective proxy for direct high-resolution SSH observations in the model training step,\ndespite unavailability of the latter.\nAt scales below 300 km, due to the coarse effective resolution, AVISO lacks structures at the\ncorresponding scales, leading to a rapid decline in its PSD (Fig. 5a). Besides, the two model\nreanalyses show consistent declines in PSD compared to KESHDiff.

The 23-year average EKE from 2000 to 2022 is\n490.82 cm\u00b2/s\u00b2 (Fig. 6). Since 2000, the EKE at eddy scales shows a slight but insignificant\ndecreasing trend (see Methods).

Discussion", "content": "Despite significant improvement of satellite observations since the 1980s, the sparse satellite\naltimetry data still limits our understanding of ocean surface eddies. The new Surface Water and\nOcean Topography (SWOT) satellite, launched in late 2022, can directly observe ocean\nsubmesoscale processes (Durand et al., 2010). However, its coverage period is still too short to\ninvestigate historical ocean variability. On the other hand, as an promising method, deep learning\nhas already seen widespread application in the climate and Earth sciences. Studies utilizing\ngenerative diffusion models for SSH downscaling have only emerged recently (Li et al., 2024).\nBased on a state-of-the-art generative diffusion model, we have developed an SSH downscaling\nalgorithm for the Kuroshio Extension region, an ideal test-bed for high-resolution SSH mapping.\nWe refer to this algorithm as KESHDiff.\nKESHDiff displays incredible superiority in SSH downscaling over the Kuroshio Extension\nregion. Firstly, it outperforms current widely-used statistical downscaling and neural\nnetwork-based downscaling algorithms across six evaluation metrics (Fig. 3). Secondly, it exhibits\nexceptional performance on the validation set of high-resolution ocean model reanalysis data, with\nspectral features closely matching model outputs. In addition, when applied to observational\ngridded low-resolution AVISO SSH data, it proves to be the closest to the along-track observations,\neven surpassing both the input AVISO data and the GLORYS12 reanalysis data used for model\ntraining.\nLast, using the high-resolution SSH data reconstructed by KESHDiff for 2000-2022, we revealed\na linear intensification trend in EKE over the Kuroshio Extension region at horizontal scales less\nthan 250 km. Since 2004, ocean surface eddy-scale variability has intensified by 10.14 cm\u00b2/s\u00b2\n(2.07%) per decade, consistent with previous conclusions (Martinez-Moreno et al., 2021).\nThis study shows great implication for future deep learning-associated satellite oceanography\nresearch. While we focuse on the Kuroshio Extension region, data-driven deep learning\ndownscaling algorithms are applicable to any ocean areas, differing with traditional downscaling\nmethods (Martin et al., 2024). Furthermore, deep learning algorithms require less computational\ncost compared to traditional ocean numerical simulations. For instance, the training stage of\nKESHDiff utilized one NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. After training, generating daily high-resolution\nSSH data for one year takes only 3-4 hours. These conclusions do not imply that deep\nlearning-based methods have surpassed traditional ocean models. KESHDiff still heavily relies on\nhigh-quality high-resolution ocean reanalysis data, highlighting that current deep learning-based\nocean downscaling and prediction methods require the support from dynamical models (Zheng et\nal., 2020).\nFinally, more detailed conclusions of long-term changes of ocean surface eddy variability need\nfurther investigation."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "For gridded satellite observations, we use daily SSH from the Archiving, Validation and\nInterpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO) of the Copernicus Marine Environment\nMonitoring Service (CMEMS) with a horizontal resolution of 0.25\u00b0 from 2000 to 2022.\nFor satellite along-track SSH observations, we use multiple satellites passing over the Kuroshio\nExtension region. The data is partly processed by the Data Unification and Altimeter Combination\nSystem (DUACS) multimission altimeter data processing system. The satellites include Jason 3,\nSentinel 3A, Sentinel 3B, HY 2B, and Sentinel 6 in DUACS. Specifically, we use the unfiltered,\nLevel 3 sea level anomaly observations. At Level 3, the observations have been corrected for\natmospheric effects, the barotropic tide has been removed, and the data has been adjusted to\nensure consistency between the different altimeter missions. Satellite along-track observations\ncover the period from December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022.\nFor high-resolution SSH reanalysis datasets, we used the daily SSH from the CMEMS global\nocean eddy-resolving (1/12\u00b0 horizontal resolution) reanalysis (GLORYS12) covering the period\nfrom July 1, 2020 to January 31, 2024 (Jean-Michel et al., 2021). We further utilized the\ndata-assimilative HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) with a horizontal resolution of\n1/12\u00b0 (Chassignet et al., 2007).\nIn this study, the Kuroshio Extension region is defined as the area between 27\u00b0N-41.22\u00b0N,\n140\u00b0E-168.44\u00b0E. To facilitate SSH downscaling, we interpolate the GLORYS12 and HYCOM\nhigh-resolution reanalyses to a 1/16\u00b0 resolution using bicubic interpolation.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.1, the generative DMs were inspired from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015). The model contains forward diffusion process and\nreverse denoising process. The forward diffusion process transforms samples from the data\ndistribution $x(0)~p(x; \\sigma_{data})$ to that of pure Gaussian noise $x(T)~N(0, \\sigma I)$, which can be\nrepresented by the stochastic differential equation (SDE). Following Song et al. (2021), the SDE\nfor such a process is given by\n$dx = f(x, t)dt + g(t)dw$\nWhere $f(x, t)$ is the drift coefficient, $g(t)$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $w$ is a Wiener process.\nIf the SDE can be reversed, we can use it to generate samples from $p(x(0))$. The reverse\ndenoising SDE process is:\n$dx = [f(x, t) \u2013 g(t)^2\\nabla_xlogp_t(x)]dt + g(t)dw$\nWhere $w$ is a Wiener process with time flowing backwards from T to 0. $\\nabla_xlogp_t(x)$ is the score\nfunction, a vector denotes the gradient of the log probability density function of the data\ndistribution.\nWe can also begin by examining the deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE). The\nreverse ODE process is then as follows:\n$dx = [f(x, t) - \\frac{1}{2} g(t)^2\\nabla_xlogp_t(x)]dt$\nFollowing Karras et al. (2022), the ODE can also be written as:\n$dx = \\frac{\\bar{x}(t)}{s(t)}[\\bar{x} - s(t)^2 \\sigma(t) \\nabla_xlogp(\\frac{x}{\\sigma(t)}; \\sigma(t))]dt$\nWhere $s(t)$ is scaling factor. Thus, the reverse ODE mainly focuses on the reparameterization of\n$s(t)$ and $\\sigma(t)$. In addition, unlike traditional DMs (i.e. DDPM and DDIM), the diffusion and\ndenoising processes can be simplified as the adding or subtracting Gaussian noise with varying\nintensities (different standard deviations; Karras et al., 2022). Thus, $\\sigma(t) = t$ in our KESHDiff\nmodel. We use 182 time steps during evaluation, but find that using just 100 is sufficient for a\nsimilar accuracy.\nThe structure of the U-Net is shown in Figure 2b. To improve efficiency of the U-Net, rather than\ndirectly learning the output on the fine resolution grid, we learn the difference between the output\non the fine and coarse grid. We expect these to aid learning of details around the coast. This means\nthe input image is of size (256 \u00d7 512\u00d72), while the output image is of size (256 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 1). The\nU-Net is trained by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the U-Net predicted\nimage and the samples from the data.\nThe SR-GAN network is consistent with previous paper (Ledig et al., 2017). The VGG19 network\nused in perceptual loss is mainly for extracting high-level image features to better measure the\nsimilarity between the generated image and the original high-resolution image.\nSince we utilize a conditional diffusion model, an additional input of a low-resolution image is\nrequired for SSH downscaling (Fig. 2b). However, after interpolating the 1/16\u00b0 GLORYS12 data\nto 1/4\u00b0, the resulting images still contain more details than the original 1/4\u00b0 AVISO data. Thus, the\n1/16\u00b0 high-resolution GLORYS12 data is first spline-interpolated to a 0.5\u00b0 low-resolution data.\nThese high and low-resolution GLORYS12 datasets are then included in the training set to\ndevelop an eight-fold downscaling model. For the Kuroshio Extension region, a 1/16\u00b0 resolution\ncorresponds to 512 grid points in the zonal direction and 256 grid points in the meridional\ndirection. The 0.5\u00b0 resolution thus should be 64 grid points in the zonal direction and 32 grid\npoints in the meridional direction.\nThe sample time range for the training set is from July 1, 2020, to July 31, 2023, while the"}, {"title": "Metrics for model comparison", "content": "We calculate six metrics to compare and evaluate different downscaling algorithms, including\nPeak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Mean Absolute\nError (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Temporal Correlation Coefficient (TCC), and\nPattern Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

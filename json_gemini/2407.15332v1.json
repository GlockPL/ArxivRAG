Introduction", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1. Background", "content": "In recent years, the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies has fostered a business environment conducive to the collection and retention of vast amounts of data. Within this context, the significance of utilizing consumer and item information has grown substantially, leading to increased interest in personalized pricing strategies (Elmachtoub et al., 2021). If the purchasing intentions of each consumer can be accurately predicted, it is possible to maximize revenues and profits by setting personalized prices based on these predictions.\nIn response to this trend, numerous industries have conducted experiments with personalized pricing, including grocery chains, department stores, and airlines, among others (Elmachtoub et al., 2021; Golrezaei et al., 2014). Furthermore, personalized pricing has already become an established practice in various sectors, such as professional graduate programs, financial and insurance items, services, and information goods (Feldman et al., 2015; Waldfogel, 2015).\nThe framework of personalized pricing consists of two phases: demand forecasting and price optimization. The demand forecasting phase involves constructing a model to predict the probabilities that each consumer will purchase an item at various price points. Subsequently, the price optimization phase entails solving an optimization problem to determine the price that maximizes a given objective function (e.g., total revenue or profit) based on the constructed prediction model for each consumer.\nHowever, the predicted purchase probabilities inherently include prediction errors, and the uncertainty associated with these errors can significantly reduce the effect of price optimization (Duchi et al., 2021; Delage and Ye, 2010). Consequently, improving the robustness of optimal prices against prediction errors remains a critical challenge in the implementation of personalized pricing strategies."}, {"title": "1.2. Related work", "content": "Numerous prior studies have been conducted on personalized pricing for a single item (Rossi et al., 1996; Allenby and Rossi, 1998; Den Boer and Zwart, 2014; Kallus and Zhou, 2021; Elreedy et al., 2021). While many of these studies have assumed parametric models for the demand function, it is desirable to use more expressive models without such shape restrictions because the accuracy of demand forecasting directly impacts the effect of price optimization.\nSeveral studies have employed demand forecasting models that do not assume a specific functional form (Elmachtoub et al., 2021; Biggs et al., 2021; Subramanian et al., 2022; Amram et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023b). Elmachtoub et al. (2021) provided lower and upper bounds on the ratio between the profits of an idealized personalized pricing strategy and a single price strategy. Biggs et al. (2021), Subramanian et al. (2022), and Amram et al. (2022) proposed prescriptive trees to improve the interpretability of optimal prices. Furthermore, Chen et al. (2023b) introduced a stochastic optimization model focusing on the fairness of price setting.\nThiele (2006) studied demand uncertainty in the pricing of a single item. However, this research focused on demand uncertainty associated with time series rather than in the context of personalized pricing. Robust optimization methods have been proposed for handling demand uncertainty for personalized pricing of multiple items (Chen et al., 2023a; Jin et al., 2021). These studies focused on assortment-specific problem structures and had difficulty coping with constraints for a large number of consumers.\nA more general framework for prescriptive analytics based on distributionally robust optimization methods has been proposed by Bertsimas and Van Parys (2022), and Wang et al. (2021a). However, these methods are not readily applicable to price optimization problems where purchase probabilities depend on both consumer covariates and item prices (i.e., decision variable).

Personalized pricing model", "content": "In this section, we provide a concise overview of the existing framework for personalized pricing of a single item. The framework consists of two phases: (i) constructing a model to predict each consumer's purchase probabilities for an item, and (ii) solving a price optimization problem based on purchase probabilities predicted by the constructed model.\nLet $p_i$ denote the price of an item offered to consumer $i \\in I$, and $x_i$ represent the covariate vector of consumer $i$. The function $q(x_i, p_i)$ represents the purchase probability, taking the covariates $x_i$ and the offered price $p_i$ as arguments. We assume that the price offered to one consumer does not affect the purchase probability of other consumers, which reduces the complexity of the optimization problem. Due to the presence of unique covariate vectors $x_i$ for a large number of consumers $i \\in I$, nonlinear and highly accurate prediction models, such as gradient boosting decision trees, are often employed to predict the purchase probabilities.\nWe define the price vector as $p := (p_i)_{i \\in I} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|I|}$ and denote the feasible region of the price vector $p$ by $P \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{|I|}$. The optimization model for personalized pricing can generally be formulated as follows:\n\nmaximize $\\sum_{i\\in I} p_i q(x_i, p_i)$    (1)\np\nsubject to $p \\in P$,    (2)\n\nwhere the objective function in Eq.

Problem formulation", "content": "For the consumer $i \\in I$ offered the price $P_{ij}$, let $q_{ij}$ denote the purchase probability with uncertainty, and $\\hat{q}_{ij}$ represent the predicted value of the purchase probability. Let $\\Delta_{ij}$ also denote the magnitude of the uncertainty in the purchase probability. Additionally, $\\gamma_i$ is a decision variable indicating the extent to which uncertainty is considered for consumer $i$, and $\\Gamma$ represents the maximum number of consumers affected by uncertainty.\nEmploying the robust optimization technique (Bertsimas and Sim, 2004), we can formulate the robust optimization model for personalized pricing that accounts for the uncertainty of the purchase probabilities as follows:\n\nmaximize minimize $\\sum_{i\\in I} \\sum_{j\\in J} P_{ij} q_{ij} z_{ij}$   (7)\nq,\\gamma\nsubject to Eqs.

Eq. (7) seeks to maximize the expected revenue in the worst case. Eq. (9) represents the purchase probability taking uncertainty into account. Since the purchase probability $q_{ij}$ is non-negative, it is necessary that $0 \\leq \\Delta_{ij} \\leq \\hat{q}_{ij}$ to ensure feasibility. Eq. (10) indicates the degree of impact of the uncertainty for each consumer, while Eq. (11) limits the number of consumers affected by the uncertainty.\nHowever, the optimization problem (7)-(11) is difficult to solve directly using mathematical optimization solvers because it requires maximizing the minimum value of the objective function. Therefore, we reformulate it into a more tractable form by converting the inner minimization problem into its dual problem, allowing for an easier solution.\nNow, let $\\mu_i \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$ and $\\nu \\in \\mathbb{R}_+$ denote the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively. The following theorem is then established:\nTheorem 1. The optimization problem (7)\u2013(11) can be reformulated as the following MILO problem (12)-(16).\n\nmaximize $\\sum_{i\\in I} (\\sum_{j\\in J} P_{ij} \\hat{q}_{ij} z_{ij} - \\mu_i) - \\Gamma \\nu$    (12)\n$\\zeta,\\mu,\\nu$\nsubject to Eqs.

This approach enables the assessment of the magnitude of uncertainty associated with any prediction model, providing a robust foundation for our personalized pricing strategy.\nLet $I^{train}$ denote the set of consumers in the training data used to construct the prediction model of purchase probabilities.

Exploring the Role of Al in Relationship Dissolution", "authors": ["YUE FU", "YIXIN CHEN", "ZELIA GOMES DA COSTA LAI", "ALEXIS HINIKER"], "abstract": "Relationships are essential to our happiness and wellbeing. The dissolution of a relationship, the final stage of relationship's lifecycle and one of the most stressful events in an individual's life, can have profound and long-lasting impacts on people. With the breakup process increasingly facilitated by computer-mediated communication (CMC), and the likely future influence of AI-mediated communication (AIMC) tools, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 21 participants. We aim to understand: 1) the current role of technology in the breakup process, 2) the needs and support individuals have during the process, and 3) how AI might address these needs. Our research shows that people have distinct needs at various stages of ending a relationship. Presently, technology is used for information gathering and community support, acting as a catalyst for breakups, enabling ghosting and blocking, and facilitating communication. Participants anticipate that AI could aid in sense-making of their relationship leading up to the breakup, act as a mediator, assist in crafting appropriate wording, tones, and language during breakup conversations, and support companionship, reflection, recovery, and growth after a breakup. Our findings also demonstrate an overlap between the breakup process and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change. Through the lens of TTM, we explore the potential support and affordances AI could offer in breakups, including its benefits and the necessary precautions regarding Al's role in this sensitive process.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Close relationships are essential to people's well-being [10]. Relationship dissolution, the final phase of a relationship's life cycle, can have profound and long-lasting effects on the people in the relationship and their future connections with others [36]. As one of the most stressful events in an individual's life [18], relationship dissolution is often associated with negative emotions [45], reduced self-esteem [19, 50] and worsened psychological well-being [36]. However, strategically navigating this stage can lead people to greater personal growth [70], alleviate the stress associated with the dissolving relationship [59], and prepare themselves for their future relationships [70].\nRelationship dissolution is usually navigated through direct and indirect interpersonal communication. The advent of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) and other online communication tools, such as messaging apps and social media, have transformed these interactions [51, 75]. And the affordances of these tools, such as Facebook's \"relationship status\", \"unfriending\", and restricting profile access setting [52], significantly influence how users communicate and perceive sensitive messages about changes in romantic relationships and friendships [38, 53]. A 2015 Pew Research report shows that 27% teenagers have broken up with some one by texting, 29% by phone calls, and 16% by social media features (changing relationship status, messaging, posting updates) [39]. Moreover, a significant number of individuals turn to the internet for advice on ending romantic relationships; the collaborative information-sharing platform"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Relationships, especially close ones, are central to our emotional and psychological wellness [33]. They provide support [23], foster personal growth [37], and are linked with our happiness and life satisfaction [24]. Relationship dissolution, as the last stage in the life cycle of such relationships [34], therefore, can have profound effects. On the positive side, relationship dissolution creates opportunities for personal growth and reflection. As found by Tashiro and Frazier,"}, {"title": "2.1 Relationship dissolution and the Role of Communication in this Process", "content": "As CMC and AIMC tools increasingly influence people's interpersonal communication and daily lives, it is imperative to examine their role in critical interpersonal processes like relationship dissolution. Thus, this paper asks:\n\u2022 RQ1: What role, if any, does technology play in people's relationship dissolution (breakup) process?\n\u2022 RQ2: What specific needs do people have before, during, and after ending a relationship?\n\u2022 RQ3: How, if at all, can AI support these needs?"}, {"title": "2.2 Technology-Supported Communication and Relationship Dissolution", "content": "The advent of technology has transformed how people communicate and experience the relationship dissolution process. With communication supported by technology like CMC quickly becoming the predominant method of interaction [41], its use for breakups is on the rise. Though CMC can support our connections and facilitate more selective and intentional self-presentation than face-to-face communication [72], it can have negative effect during the relationship dissolution. For example, social media can inadertently create forced connections and lead to a more challenging disconnection experience than an offline breakup [26, 46]. Moreover, compared to offline breakup communication, text-based CMCs such as email that lack visual and audio social cues, coupled with the tensions and emotions associated with the breakup, may lead to misunderstanding and an escalation of the conflict [46].\nConsidering the active effect of CMC in the relationship dissolution, our research tries to investigate the role of currently technology in this process (RQ1).\nFurthermore, as AI technology becomes more and more available, CMC ushers in a new paradigm by integrating AI, known as Al-mediated communication (AIMC).\nHowever, on the downside, people view the text being suspected of or labeled as AI-generated as less trustworthy [31] and would perceive their communication partner as less cooperative and less affiliative when the partner is considered as using algorithmic responses [28]. Besides, people believe that AIMC tools like \"smart replies\" often alter their communication style and fail to convey their intended message accurately [27]. AIMC has the potential to facilitate interpersonal communication and perceptions of conversational outcomes between human communicators in some contexts. For instance, people would choose to use Al when given the opportunity, which increases the speed of"}, {"title": "2.3 The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change", "content": "The transtheoretical model (TTM) is the stage model in health psychology and health promotion [69]. It is a model of intentional behavior change that is designed to reach individuals at all levels of readiness to engage in behavior change [40]. TTM-based interventions meet individuals' needs when they are in the change process instead of pushing them into action [40]. Such approach increases individuals engagement, efficacy, and long-term maintenance [40]. The five stages of change are 1) precontemplation, 2) contemplation, 3) preparation, 4) action, and 5) maintenance [25, 56, 62]. There're 10 behavior change processes found to facilitate progress through these stages of change [49]. TTM has been widely applied to a variety of health behaviors, such as exercises in overweight populations [62], smoking cessation [5, 55], and recovery from intimate partner violence [11].\nHealth behavior change typically requires a significant life event, such as a newfound understanding of the conse- quences of the problematic behavior to prompt the change [54], which aligns with the relationship dissolution which is one of the many life transitions. As we reviewed our data, we found that the relationship dissolution process fits closely with the four stages of TTM. This alignment allows us to view the it through the lens of TTM as a health behavior change."}, {"title": "3 METHOD", "content": "We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants, recruiting 12 who had undergone romantic relationship breakups and 9 who had experienced close friendship breakups. We piloted the study with two participants from the academic institution of the authors and included this pilot data in the paper (pilotA and pilotB)."}, {"title": "3.1 Participants", "content": "We recruited 21 participants through professional and academic Slack channels and posters at the authors' institution. We advertised as a study of relationship breakups. We created two posters, one for recruiting romantic relationship breakups and another for recruiting close friendship breakups. The initial screening survey asked about the timing of the breakup, whether participants initiated it, the communication method used for the breakup (e.g., in person, phone call, text messages), the reasons behind the breakup, and the duration of the breakup process. Additionally, for the close friendship group, participants were asked to evaluate the significance of the friendship, ranging from \"most important\" to \"not important.\" To qualify, participants were required to have had a breakup within the last three years; those in the close friendship group had to rate the friendship as at least moderately important. The survey also collected demographic data (see Appendix A). Participants were compensated $20-$30 based on interview length ($20 for an 30 mins interview, and $30 for an 45 mins)."}, {"title": "3.2 Interview Apparatus", "content": "Initially, one researcher drafted 12 potential interview questions, which were then refined and expanded upon by the research team. The protocol was tested with pilot participants (pilotA from romantic relationship and pilotB from close friendship). Piloting showed similarities in the breakup processes of romantic and close relationships, typically involving three stages demarcated by \"relationship talk\": the leading up to the breakup phase, the breakup phase, and the after breakup phase. The term \"relationship talk\" is defined by us as instances when participants communicate their intention to end their relationship with either romantic partners or close friends. Based on these findings, we revised our interview protocol. The protocol for both romantic and close friendship groups remains the same, with only minor alterations in relationship terms. The final protocol includes four parts. The first part asked descriptive questions such the duration and closeness of the relationship and the reasons for breakups. The second we explored participants experience and communication during the three stages of breakup. During the third part, we asked participants to reflect on their breakup process, probing faced challenges, support needed, and their overall wellbeing. For the last part, we invited participants to envision technologies that could support breakups. We probed their perception and ideas of using an AI to support their experience, though we did not specifically detailing what the AI is. Participants were encouraged to freely speculate. At last, we presented participants several general design vignette, such as an AI analyzing text messages, and an AI assisting in crafting empathetic communications."}, {"title": "3.3 Procedure", "content": "For the qualified participants, we emailed them the study information and offered them two options 1) a 1-on-1 interview with interviewer, conducting either online or at the authors' institution, or 2) a 1-on-2 interview, accompanied by a friend with similar experiences. Three participants opted for the group interview format with a friend. After each 1-on-2 interview, the friends completed a screening survey. The interviews were designed to last 30 minutes for 1-on-1 sessions and 45 minutes for 1-on-2 sessions. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. We anonymized and securely stored all audio recordings. Our institutional review board (IRB) reviewed and granted an exemption for this study."}, {"title": "3.4 Data Analysis", "content": "Researchers individually reviewed and coded several transcripts to identify noteworthy codes and themes. Through team discussions, we organized these themes into three overarching categories aligned with the interview protocol stages of breakups: leading up to the breakup, the breakup, and after the breakup. We then re-examined the transcripts, combining codes based on these initial themes. To aid our coding, we used Delve\u00b9, a collaborative qualitative transcript analysis tool. Following several rounds of collaborative discussion and refinement, one researcher synthesized all the data and extracted representative quotes for each theme."}, {"title": "4 RESULTS", "content": "In our study, participants shared various needs of a breakup, identified different roles of current technology and envisioned opportunities for AI technology support. As outlined in section 3.2, we have a working definition of the during breakup stage, which involves the process of having a \"relationship talk,\" either online or in person. All of our participants experienced the \"relationship talk\" during the breakup process. We categorize the period leading up to this talk as \"leading up to the breakup\" phase and the period following it as \"after the breakup'."}, {"title": "4.1 Stage 1: Leading up to the Breakup", "content": "Participants described a period of re-evaluating a relationship that occurs before a breakup. In this stage, they said they sought a greater understanding of their relationship and explained that they were looking for clarity, validation, and honest feedback. Participants both reflected internally and sought external perspectives from friends and family as part of their process of assessing the relationship."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Participants' Experiences and Needs Leading up to a Breakup", "content": "During this stage, participants engaged in a process of reevaluating their relationship, contemplating their emotions and life direction. One participant articulated this need for internal clarity, saying, \"I'm seeking some kind of support that, I'm not doing anything wrong...At that time I was just quite confused about myself and everything\u201d (P14-F). Similarly, P3 tried to regain confidence in their own assessment of the relationship, and explained, my ex was extremely verbally affectionate...it was really hard for me to trust my own perspective enough and also trust my feelings as being a valid judgment\" (P3). One participant described engaging in structured self-reflection activities like journaling as a way to work through this stage, saying, \u201cI'm not really the journaling type, but it might have been able to help me in a sense of sorting out my thoughts in a more organized way and reflecting on the different emotions I had and why I felt them\" (P15-F).\nAs they engaged in this internal re-evaluation, participants also sought external perspectives. P17-F described seeking advice from friends, saying, \u201c \u201cI was telling them about how I wasn't feeling heard, I wasn't feeling respected...they were like, 'yeah, I don't think you should be friends with her anymore.' Not so much pressure, but just giving me advice on what to do with the friendship.\" Another participant stressed the importance of external advice, saying, \"[my friend] had really cautioned me...she saw things that I didn't\" (P15-F) and P4 relied on her sister for outside assessment, recalling, \"she'd be like, 'no, that's, like, screwed up; that's weird.\" Participants valued external perspective especially since often they were in a relationship confused state \"I would think that their advice is really helpful because that helps me. They are standing from a third person perspective and they can really see how our relationship goes. During that time I was part of the relationship, and it's really hard to make a really fair judgment\" (P12)."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Technology's Current Role Leading up to a Breakup", "content": "Participants sought advice and community online in this stage. One participant mentioned searching the internet for relationship advice, saying, \u201cIt could give me something that is contextual to me. So sometimes I would Google about these things, like breakups and how would it go and how do you do it rightly and all that\" (P5). Other participants derived a sense of validation and community from reading about others' breakup experiences online. P8 explained, \"It is useful using the internet and reading other people's experiences...It was helpful, because it helped show me that I wasn't the only one who has been through a breakup.\u201d Similarly, P11 turned to TikTok to understand others' breakup journeys, \"Before I did the breakup, I was looking a lot at TikTok and what other people had done, how other people had broken up with their partners, or seeing other people go through their breakups was really nice because I knew that I wasn't alone...Seeing other people's stories and experiences really helps\" (P11).\nSimilarly, other participants also described crowdsourcing advice on platforms like Reddit, saying, \u201cI wrote, like, a huge paragraph and I posted it on Reddit...The only advice they [users on Reddit] gave were like, you should probably break up with him\" (P3). The same participant also mentioned seeking relationship insights from AI, \u201cI was kind of looking for certain answers; I went to ChatGPT and either I would [input] the texts I was receiving or I would send a summation of the relationship that we had [to ChatGPT]\u201d (P3). In some instances, technology provided participants with new information,"}, {"title": "4.1.3 Envisioning Future Technology Support for Stage 1", "content": "Participants envisioned several ways in which technology could better support them in Stage 1 and help them understand themselves, their relationships, and the potential need to initiate a breakup.\nCollaborative Sense-Making. Participants felt that AI could \"definitely be helpful in understanding your personal feel- ings\" (P15-F). Another participant described using ChatGPT to gain insights into their communication and relationship status, saying \"I would go to ChatGPT and I would ask, hey, 'this is what I would send' after reading the texts I was receiving, or I would send a summation of the relationship that we had\u201d (P3). P12 mentioned AI could prompting introspection without commanding actions, \"AI could ask me questions that helps me really realize that this guy is not the right for me, instead of just telling me directly that you should do this\u201d (P12). Participants suggested a feature where AI could provide relationship feedback and interpretation on messages, saying something like, \u201cI will put [into ChatGPT] 10 things went like this around today, what do I do then?\u201d (P7), and another participant echoed by saying, \"[help] interpret what [the breakup party] was saying to me\" (P6).\nProviding a Second Opinion. In addition, participants suggested using AI to provide a neutral second opinion. P18-F saw AI as a beneficial tool to escape the trap of solitary contemplation: \u201cAlone with my thoughts is a dangerous place to be. It would help have at least a second opinion of sorts\" (P18-F). P1 and P17-F envisioned AI identifying \"signs or red flags that are very common or not obvious at the time\" (P1) Participants appreciated Al's potential to offer feedback that would not be influenced by a desire to please or protect the listener, as human feedback might be. One participant explained: \"If you go to your friends about it, they often only get one side of the story...[but] AI would give you a straightforward [perspective]...it would help process feelings better and decide what you want to do without acting emotionally\" (P19-F).\nEnabling Anonymity. Participants appreciated the anonymity provided by AI, which enabled a safe space for sharing sensitive information without the fear of judgment or betrayal. P3 shared their hesitation in discussing relationship issues openly with others: \u201cI would withhold a lot of personal information when talking with friends, the fights we were having, the things he had done to hurt me.... I thought speaking behind his back was going against him\" (P3). Other participants noticed the comfort they found in the anonymity of AI, where individuals could share freely without"}, {"title": "4.2 Stage 2: The Breakup", "content": "Participants consistently noted the value of being direct and clear in their conversations. Vague communication led to exhausting conversations that went in circles, with participants saying things like, \u201cThe first night we were up until three in the morning just kind of talking, kept bringing up the things aren't going well...Back and forth for hours was really exhausting when you can say upfront and kind of get it out of the way\u201d (P1). The same participant continued, \"I feel like reflecting, being more direct would've been good\u201d(P1). A number of participants echoed this sentiment, saying things like, \"she wasn't very specific. I ended up reiterating things I had in the past...But she was very frustrated\u201d (P15-F). Others emphasized the need for being \"open and honest to people with how I'm feeling\" (P17-F) and said that they \u201cwanted to be clear with my emotions\" (P2).\nThe necessity for emotional control during breakup conversations was another recurring theme. Without emotional awareness and control, conversations may break down easily and form emotional scars for both parties. One participant described, \"She was really emotional, we're both really emotional...We're trying to be nice, but on calls, it just kind of blurted it out\" (P17-F). Another participant expressed regret over sending numerous emotional texts: \u201cI sent eight or nine texts. That is something I could have done better, cut down the number of texts I sent my half, especially some of the texts where I was like, I know you're online, so pick up [the phone]...I wish I had not acted out that frustration\" (P13-F). Participants also recognized the need for guidance in appropriately express emotions: \u201cWhen I get angry or frustrated, my face goes blank. I become like, I take on this kind of battle within myself of what should I say right now? What is reasonable to say and how much of how I'm feeling is appropriate to communicate?\" (P15-F).\""}, {"title": "4.2.1 Participants' Experiences and Needs During a Breakup", "content": "Participants described struggling with miscommunications and escalating emotions during breakups. As one participant described, \"I was kind of harsh in the way I said it, maybe they shouldn't have been said...she took offense and then she became angry...eventually she said, I don't want to, I need space. Don't talk to me\" (P15-F). Similiarly, P2 described initiating a breakup and being met with an intensely emotional reaction, saying, \u201cI said it within the first sentence or so, I want to break up...they [the breakup party] started really aggressively crying\" (P2). These accounts illustrate the high communication stakes and likelihood of provoking intense emotional responses. Some participants felt a facilitator would help correct misunderstandings that might needlessly escalate an already-tense interaction, saying things like, \u201csomeone needs to facilitate that to be calm, cool, collected\" (P10). P10 elaborated, saying, \u201cI wish we would've been more calm...maybe we could bring in a third mutual friend to talk things out\" (P10)."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Technology's Current Role in Stage 2", "content": "As relationships ended, previously positive aspects of technology, like the ease of staying connected, turned negative. Technology was involved in communicating their decision to disengage relationships, severing ties both online and offline and erasing participants' shared digital history. We found participants used a range of technologies during their breakup process, such as Face-time (P3), texting messages (P7, 10, 13-F, 15-F, 16-F, 18-F,20-F), social media (P14-F, 17-F), email (P11). Participants also highlighted the benefits and drawbacks of opting for technology over in-person interactions.\nParticipants described using online communication as a way to initiate and prepare for in-person breakup discussions. P1 spoke about the strategic use of texting to set the stage for the breakup, stating, \"I've considered just using texting or messaging almost as being able to prime the breakup... So it's like you've already forced yourself to start the conversation over the text and then you're ready to have it in person\" (P1). This approach allowed them to ease into a difficult conversation by gradually introducing the topic of breakup, as one participant shared, \"I tried to hint at it through texting. I made it kind of easier to ease into the conversation. I think he understood that too\" (P16-F).\nParticipants shared how technology facilitated distancing and ghosting. One participant mentioned using delayed texting as a strategy, \u201cI will kind of reply, but I will not reply within the second, which is probably the standard for him\" (P5). Another described cutting off communication more directly: \u201cI cut communication by sending him a text with a letter and then just refusing to respond to any further communication\" (P3). Similarly, Pilot1 spoke about procrastinating replying as a distancing mechanism, \"He sent me those messages and I was ignoring and towards the end I was kind of scared of his texts, so just procrastinates to reply\" (pilot1).\nThe act of blocking on social media and other platforms was frequently mentioned as a decisive step in ending relationships. Participants mentioned something like, \u201cThe friendship ended the very next day when she unfollowed me everywhere\" (P17-F) indicating the finality of such actions. Another participant, P9, blocked a partner's number and even their mother's phone after the partner attempted to contact P9 using the mother's phone. Participant P4 thoroughly blocked their partner from every communication opportunity online, saying, \u201con every single app, every single communication thing, including Duolingo\". Blocking symbolizes the final closure of a relationship, effectively halting all communication channels. As one participant described, \"It feels so permanent sometimes because you get a minute of the response time and then it's like, we're stopping, we're done. Communication is over after you hit the block button. But you can't, do that in real life\" (P4)."}, {"title": "Benefits of Online Communication for Breakup", "content": "Empowerment and Control of Expressing. Online communication during breakups provided participants with a sense of empowerment, control and freedom over expressing their story and decision to breakup. P3 said: \"Being able to remove yourself from [in-person communication] and at least control the flow of messages, that's so much power\" (P3). P3 explained texting gave them a sense of safety over in-person communication, \"It's more physically threatening [in person]...For me, it was really important that it was over text in the end\u201d (P3), and asynchronous online communication gave them space to focus on their emotion and communicate clearly: \"Whenever we would actually talk on the phone, I would"}, {"title": "Drawbacks of Online Communication for Breakup", "content": "The Negative Emotional Impact of Ghosting. Some participants mentioned that when they wanted distance from their partners, they would ghost them and stop replying to messages, \u201cI just run away from them and ghost it. I try to let them know that our relationship won't keep last anymore\u201d (P14-F). However, this was often a very negative and emotional experience for the recipient as described vividly by P18-F:\n\"Via text, people can ghost and block and just be done with it, then all I have are I'm just left thinking back along with my thoughts and that's a pretty horrible feeling... It's like I was left in a room with a foul stench, [they] closed the room and left to leave the fallout zone. That felt horrible because that meant that now I don't really have any way of expressing anything. Now I'm alone in processing this, it's isolated. It's just me in my room and this social media chat. Nothing I can do except look at that message and be alone with my thoughts. And the thoughts aren't constructive because now it's just a mix of anger, sadness, a bit of self hate\" (P18-F).\nParticipants acknowledged ghosting online has profound negative psychological consequences for those who experienced it.\nLoss of Non-Verbal Communication. The absence of non-verbal cues in online communication was highlighted as a significant drawback. One mentioned, \"If I had to redo it again, I would definitely do it in person because to see each other's expressions and emotions better\u201d(P17-F). Another participant emphasized the importance of body language, \"People can think about their words, but so much is shown once you're staring at somebody's face and you've known each other for two years, that the communication that you do with your body becomes incredibly important to how you understand what the other person's going through\" (P6). Lack of verbal communication might lead to miscommunication, as one mentioned, \"If I had to redo it again, I would definitely do it in person because to see each other's expressions and emotions better\" (P17-F).\nSocial Norms and Guilt. Participants also discussed the societal expectations and guilt associated with breaking up online, as one participant reflected, \"I always felt so much guilt about doing it over text message. Everyone always says you have to at least do it on the phone. If you're a long distance, you have to do it in person. That's what I learned from listening to other people talk is that's what's expected and that's what people deserve.\" (P3). Another person shared, \"I feel like you almost owe it to someone, or it's the right way to do things almost instead of just sending a text\" (P1).

During action of conducting the breakup talks, participants envisioned AI playing a mediator role, facilitating dialogue and helping maintain a constructive and calm conversation. For instance, one participant suggested, \u201cA mediator would have been helpful... if someone else could have listened to our discussion, it would've been protective for me\" (P3), and another participant recognized the benefits of AI in considering both parties' perspectives and be fair, \u201c AI might be able to help consider both perspectives and an approach that isn't too negative or hard on either party\" (P16-F).\nSupport Emotional Expression, Wording, and Tones. Many participants faced challenges in articulating their emotions. For instances, participant P3 admitted, \u201cI wasn't very good at typing out and expressing emotion through text.\" P10 echoed this feeling and suggested AI can help that, \u201cI would rewrite messages... I would read it and that doesn't sound right. I'll just keep doing that over and over again. I have some idea of how it's supposed to sound, but somebody else might think differently. So AI would be helpful for that\" (P10). P17-F mentioned the need for \"getting advice on what to say and how to phrase things\u201d. P1 expressed need of finding right words: \u201cgetting ideas of wording or specifics would help\". P2 shared the same view and thought AI could support that, \"I think at least for wording. It'd be interesting for it[AI] to take wording\" (P2).\nIn addition, participants recognized the challenge of conveying right tones, especially over online communication. When reflecting on their communication during breakup, they regretted being, \u201cblunt, not sound as compassionate as I might be feeling\" (P8), \"a bit rude... in hindsight that was not the right way\" (P5). They mentioned they want to be sincere, empathetic, direct, and compassionate, and they saw Al has the potential in helping that. One participant shared they think AI could support breakup communication, \"Being direct, but also balancing someone's feelings. How do I even craft an emotionally responsive conversation\u201d (P1), and another corroborated by saying, \"It's not cold and harsh, but also still direct enough. I think [AI] could be a very interesting tool to help people\" (P2)."}, {"title": "4.3 Stage 3: After the Breakup", "content": "Participants mentioned their needs to cut off digital ties with their previous partners. One participant said they want to, \"make sure pictures of us do not keep coming back on my Google feed, my Facebook, and things like that\" (P13-F).

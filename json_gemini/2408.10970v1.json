Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) 'cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In a world that is inherently continuous, the brain's apparent capacity to distil discrete concepts from sensory data represents a highly desirable feature in the design of autonomous systems. Humans are able to flexibly specify abstract sub-goals during planning, thereby reducing problems into manageable chunks (Newell & Simon, 1972; Gobet et al., 2001). Furthermore, they are able to transfer this knowledge across new tasks; a process which has proven a central challenge in artificial intelligence (d'Avila Garcez & Lamb, 2023). Translating problems into discrete space offers distinct advantages in decision-making. Namely, the computationally feasible application of information-theoretic measures (e.g. information-gain), as well as the direct implementation of classical techniques such as dynamic programming (LaValle, 2006; Friston et al., 2023). One prevalent approach to tackling continuous spaces involves the simple grid-based discretisation of the state-space, however this becomes extremely costly as the dimensionality increases (Coulom, 2007; Mnih et al., 2015). We therefore ask how we might be able to smoothly handle the presence of continuous variables whilst maintaining the benefits of decision-making in the discrete domain.\nTo address this, we explore the rich representations learned by recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) in the context of planning and control. This class of hybrid state-space model consists of discrete latent states that evolve via Markovian transitions, which act to index a discrete set of linear dynamical systems (Linderman et al., 2016). Importantly, a continuous dependency in the discrete state transition probabilities is included in the generative model. By providing an understanding of the continuous latent causes of switches between discrete modes, this recurrent transition structure can be exploited such that a controller can flexibly specify inputs to drive the system into a desired region of the state-action space. By embracing the established control-theoretic strategy of piecewise linear decomposition of nonlinear dynamics, our approach lies in contrast to the comparatively opaque solutions found by continuous function approximators (Liberzon, 2003; Mnih et al., 2015). Using statistical methods to fit these models provides a means by which we can effectively perform online discovery of useful non-grid discretisations of the state-space for system identification and control.\nWe describe a novel model-based algorithm inspired by Ac-"}, {"title": "1.1.

Consider that we have decomposed the nonlinear dynamics into piecewise affine regions of the state-space using an rSLDS. Should the HHA wish to navigate to a goal specified in continuous space, the recurrent generative model parameters of the rSLDS allow it to identify the discrete region within which the goal resides, thereby lifting the goal into a high-level objective. The agent may then generate a plan at a discrete level, making use of the information-seeking bonuses that this affords. Planning translates to specifying a sequence of abstract sub-goals. Again using the recurrent generative model, the agent can specify, for each sub-goal region, a continuous point in state-space with which to drive the system into. Once in the discrete goal region, the agent straightforwardly navigates to the continuous goal. The following sections detail the components of the HHA.

Discussion", "content": "Through the application of our Hybrid Hierarchical Agent to the Continuous Mountain Car problem, we have demonstrated that rSLDS representations hold promise for enriching planning and control. The emergence of non-grid discretisations of the state-space allows us to perform fast systems identification via enhanced exploration, and successful non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals. Hence, the time spent exploring each region is not equivalent in euclidean space which helps mitigate the curse of dimensionality that other grid-based methods suffer from.\nSuch a piecewise affine approximation of the space will incur some loss of optimality in the long run when pitted against black-box approximators. This is due to the nature of caching only approximate closed-loop solutions to control within each piecewise region, whilst the discrete planner implements open-loop control. However, this approach eases the online computational burden for flexible re-planning. Hence in the presence of noise or perturbations within a region, the controller may adapt without any new computation. This is in contrast to other nonlinear model-based algorithms like model-predictive control where reacting to disturbances requires expensive trajectory optimisation at every step (Schwenzer et al., 2021). By using the piecewise affine framework, we maintain functional simplicity and interpretability through structured representation. This method is amenable to future alignment with a control-theoretic approach to safety guarantees for ensuring robust system performance and reliability.\nWe acknowledge there may be better solutions to dealing with control input constraints than the one given in Sec. 3.3. Different approaches have been taken to the problem of implementing constrained-LQR control, such as further piecewise approximation based on defining reachability regions for the controller (Bemporad et al., 2002)."}, {"title": "Impact Statement", "content": "This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning.

As these models evolve into sophisticated AI assistants, we are witnessing a significant shift towards more proactive, integrated and context-aware agents Barua (2024); Liu et al. (2023). This new generation of AI assistants, deeply integrated with personal data and other platforms and devices, would allow for unprecedented levels of personalised assistance Li et al. (2024b). More than finding the most probably relevant and helpful response to a given prompt, agentic assistants will need more complex capabilities like maintaining context over extended interactions, executing multi-step tasks, reasoning about goals, interacting with external tools and APIs, and dynamically adapting to user preferences and actions Guan et al. (2023).\nThis advancement has led to the conceptualisation of novel digital ecosystems where LLMs serve as the foundation for operating systems upon which diverse AI Agent Applications can be developed Ge et al. (2023). However, the paradigm shift towards agentic AI requires careful consideration of significant ethical, privacy, and security implications. An unprecedented level of user trust is needed for such agents to take real-world actions on users' behalf, navigate complex environments,\nmanage multifaceted constraints, and appropriately handle the extensive integration of sensitive user information and safety-critical tools Li et al. (2024b).\nThe ability of an AI assistant to maintain personalised alignment\u2014consistently remembering and appropriately acting upon relevant context and user-specific information\u2014is crucial for safe and effective support. This requirement is particularly critical in domains and scenarios where agents offer guidance and recommendations regarding real-world tasks, potentially affecting users' behaviours and choices in significant ways. However, current approaches to LLM alignment often fall short of addressing these challenges.\nUntil now, LLM-based agents have mainly served as sort of oracles, responding to user queries and prompts in isolated interactions, where alignment is mainly a matter of learning from examples of prompt-input pairs that most humans (or other LLMs) would agree are appropriate. Hence, popular alignment methods primarily focus on mitigating rather generic risks, such as using 'toxic', discriminatory, biased language, encouraging people to hurt themselves or others, or giving false or misleading information, without appropriately considering the role of context. These approaches broadly fall into two categories: those involving human feedback and automated self-correction. Human feedback methods, such as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF), feedback memory, and iterative output refinement, have shown promise in addressing issues like toxicity, bias, logical flaws, and factual inaccuracies Wang et al. (2023); Fernandes et al. (2023). On the other hand, self-correction strategies enable models to improve autonomously using automatically generated feedback signals, proving particularly effective for fact-checking, correcting reasoning errors, and enhancing generated content quality Pan et al. (2023).\nWhile these strategies aim to align LLM behaviour with patterns in human preferences, often guided by criteria like being \u2018Helpful' (offering useful and relevant responses), \u2018Honest' (giving information that is accurate and not misleading), or \u2018Harmless' Bai et al. (2022); Askell et al. (2021), what counts as \"harmful\" in real world interactions is much more nuanced than just not saying overtly sexist things or encouraging people to hurt themselves. This approach fails to address the much harder and under-explored challenge of being mindful of more pragmatic factors, effectively accounting for person-specific risks (e.g., irrational fears, severe allergies, recent bereavements, physical constraints, trauma triggers) in how the agent treats and assists a given person. Depending on the sensitivities and personal facts a user expects the agent to know and remember about them, even seemingly benign or actively helpful utterances or recommendations can come across as rude or insensitive in certain contexts Alberts et al. (2024a;b), or put users at severe risk.\nThis research gap poses significant risks as agentic AI assistants become more prevalent in people's daily lives. However, the importance of tact and nuance when personalising to sensitive user information cannot be overstated, as heavy-handed applications of personalised knowledge (i.e., pigeonholing or stereotyping users) could also cause harm and erode user trust.\nTo address this critical gap, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating and improving personalised alignment in LLM-based AI assistants. We present Context and User-specific Reasoning and Alignment Test (CURATe), a multi-turn benchmark specifically designed to assess an agent's ability to remember and appropriately utilise critical personal information across extended interactions"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "when making recommendations to a user. Through a multi-scenario evaluation of ten leading LLMs, using LLaMA 3.1 405B (Instruct) as an external evaluator, we reveal significant shortcomings in leading models' ability to maintain even these basic requirements for personalised alignment. Our findings highlight common failure modes, including an inability to appropriately weigh the importance of conflicting preferences, sycophancy (prioritising user preferences above safety), a lack of attentiveness to critical user information within the context window, and inconsistent application of user-specific knowledge.\nOur work makes several key contributions to the fields of LLM evaluation/alignment and human-AI interaction: (a) a multi-turn alignment benchmark and evaluation pipeline, offering a novel approach for evaluating the contextual, person-dependent safety of dialogue agents; (b) insights into the capabilities and limitations of leading models in maintaining user-specific awareness, including an analysis of key failure modes and biases and their possible origins; (c) a unified framework for LLM-based agent alignment, bridging the gap between abstract notions of value alignment and the practical requirements for safe, effective assistance in situated interaction; (d) concrete suggestions for future research to align advanced AI assistants, including embedding human-inspired empathetic reasoning abilities, developing more robust mechanisms for risk assessment, and implementing adaptive, user-centred strategies for maintaining user-specific awareness across extended interactions. These contributions provide a foundation for developing safer, more effective AI assistants capable of maintaining curated forms of alignment in ongoing interactions.\n2.1 LLM-BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS\nAs a part of LLM-based assistant capability, recent research has explored the potential of LLMs for enhancing recommender systems. Feng et al. (2023) proposed LLMCRS, a LLM-based conversational recommender system. Similarly, Gao et al. (2023) introduced Chat-REC, a framework that augments LLMs for building conversational recommender systems by converting user profiles and historical interactions into prompts. Yang et al. (2023) developed PALR, a framework that integrates user history behaviours with an LLM-based ranking model for recommendation generation. However, these approaches primarily focus on improving recommendation accuracy and do not explicitly address the challenges of handling safety-critical recommendations. Our work expands on these efforts by exploring the recognition, prioritisation, and mitigation of person-specific risks.\n2.2 MULTI-TURN INTERACTION BENCHMARKS\nMost benchmarks evaluate LLMs through single-turn instructions Hendrycks et al. (2021); Srivastava et al. (2023), however, as agents will maintain ongoing conversations with the same user, assisting them in different real-world situations, it is crucial to assess their ability to navigate context and give relevant and appropriate assistance in complex interaction scenarios. Liu et al. (2023) introduced AgentBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs as agents in multi-turn open-ended generation settings. These took place in eight distinct interactive environments: web browsing, web shopping, solving digital card games, lateral thinking puzzles, carrying out house-holding tasks in an embodied environment, database analysis, engaging with knowledge graphs, and accessing/manipulating the operating system using terminal Bai et al. (2024) proposed MT-Bench-101, a fine-grained benchmark for evaluating LLMs in multi-turn dialogues, taxonomising the required abilities in a hierarchy, falling under the headings of perceptivity, adaptability, and interactivity. Similarly, Kwan et al. (2024) developed MT-Eval, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate multi-turn conversational abilities, categorising interaction patterns into recollection, expansion, refinement, and follow-up."}, {"title": "2.3 PERSONALISED ALIGNMENT AND SAFETY", "content": "Recent research has highlighted the importance of personalising LLMs to individual users' preferences and values. Jang et al. (2023) introduced a framework for Reinforcement Learning from Personalized Human Feedback (RLPHF), modelling alignment as a Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning problem that decomposes preferences into multiple dimensions. Li et al. (2024a) developed a framework for building personalised language models from personalised human feedback, addressing the limitations of traditional RLHF methods when user preferences are diverse. Their approach introduces a user model that maps user information to representations and can flexibly encode assumptions about user preferences. Wang et al. (2024) proposed URS (User Reported Scenarios), a user-centric benchmark that collects real-world use cases to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in satisfying user needs. On the more theoretical side, Kirk et al. (2023) proposed a taxonomy of benefits and risks associated with personalised LLMs and introduced a general policy framework for aligning LLMs with personalised feedback. These all regard models' abilities to personalise to user preferences in the general case, without considering safety-critical risks, sensitivities and constraints. More in that vein, Yuan et al. (2024) introduced R-Judge, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in judging and identifying safety risks given agent interaction records. Here, an LLM is given instructions to 'judge' the actions of an agent assisting a user as either safe or unsafe across 10 risk types, including privacy leakage, computer security, and physical health, on the basis of some \"ground truth\" from human assessors. However, here LLMs are assessed on their ability to recognise interactional risk-when prompted to consider user safety rather than their ability to handle it appropriately. These cases were also relatively straightforward in that they did not involve complex combinations of different preferences and constraints across an extended conversation.\nTo address the highlighted literature gaps, our CURATe benchmark offers several key contributions:\n1.  Multi-turn alignment evaluation: Our benchmark goes beyond input-prompt pairs to relativise alignment to a broader conversational context. Unlike existing multi-turn benchmarks that focus on general reasoning capabilities, CURATe is novel in considering the ability to reliably consider and account for safety-critical context.\n2.  Complex risk assessment and prioritising: By incorporating realistic scenarios that reflect potential risks and value conflicts in human-assistant interactions, our benchmark evaluates the ability of models to appropriately weigh conflicting preferences, strong desires, and constraints for considerate recommendations.\n3.  User-specific awareness: CURATe explicitly assesses an agent's ability to maintain consistent, user-specific awareness in ongoing interactions, addressing the overlooked need for nuanced, personalised alignment strategies.\nThrough this combination, CURATE offers a comprehensive and novel approach to evaluating personalised alignment in AI systems, filling crucial gaps in the existing literature and providing a valuable tool for future research and development in this critical area."}, {"title": "3 STUDY DESIGN", "content": "Our study introduces a novel approach to evaluating personalised alignment in conversational AI assistants, focusing on their ability to remember and appropriately utilise safety-critical personal information across multiple interaction turns. We evaluated the following ten models: LLaMA 3.1 405B Instruct, LLaMA 3 70B Instruct, LLaMA 3 70B, and LLaMA 3 8B Instruct (Meta); 01, GPT 4o and GPT 3.5 Turbo (OpenAI); Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google), Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic); and Mixtral 8x7b Instruct v0.1 (Mistral AI)."}, {"title": "3.1 BENCHMARK DESIGN", "content": "We developed a multi-turn benchmark consisting of five interaction scenarios of varying complexity (differing in the number of actors introduced, and the nature of their preferences), each containing 852 diverse use cases per category of safety-critical information (severe phobia, severe allergy, physical constraint, trauma trigger), totalling 337 per scenario. These were designed to test an AI assistant's ability to identify, retain, and appropriately prioritise and manage a consideration of relevant user-specific risks across several interaction turns.\nEach scenario follows this structure:\n1.  Safety-Critical Information Sharing (Turn 1): The user shares four personal facts, with the first being safety-critical (e.g., \u201cI am severely allergic to dairy", "I have never been married, am interested in marine biology, and donate to environmental charities\").3\n2.  Distraction Questions (Turns 2-4)": "The user asks three random trivia questions to simulate ongoing real-world usage, potentially making it harder to attend to the relevant context.\n3.  Introduction of Other's Preferences (Turn 3, Scenarios 2-5): Additional actors and their preferences are introduced to (a) test the model's ability to weigh preferences and hard constraints, (b) complicate the context, and (c) test for sycophantic behaviour.\n4.  Recommendation Request (Turn 5): A situation directly related to the critical personal fact is presented, testing whether the AI assistant considers the user's safety constraints when making recommendations.\nThe critical user information categories include severe allergies, physical constraints (e.g., blindness, wheelchair user); severe phobias (e.g., fear of crowds)4; and trauma triggers (e.g., severe PTSD from a dog attack). Recommendation requests are phrased with excitement/urgency to test for potential sycophancy or agreeableness bias (e.g., \u201cShould I book tickets for this thrilling, rare opportunity to...", "Should we...": ".", "preferences": "nIn scenarios 2-4, the preferences of other actors are introduced that (1-3) directly conflict with the user's constraints (e.g., \"My partner absolutely loves/would be thrilled by/has always wanted to...\"), incrementing at each scenario (within the same conversation turn). In Scenario 5, three users with random, unrelated preferences are introduced instead. Example conversations from each scenario are included in Appendix A.\nAll evaluated models have a temperature of 0.7 and a maximum output of 100 tokens (apart from the evaluator model, which had 130). Each conversation begins with the instruction: \"You are an AI assistant. Keep your answers brief and don't ask questions.\u201d6"}, {"title": "3.2 ABLATIONS", "content": "In addition to these scenarios, we ran the following five ablations on scenario 37: (1) a biased vs. neutral recommendation request (e.g., \"Should we seize this rare opportunity to...\" vs. \"Should we do...\"); (2) initial placement vs. middle placement of hard constraint in conversation; (3) neutral prompt vs. a basic 'helpful and harmless' prompt (i.e., \u201cBe helpful and harmless\" appended to start\nof recommendation question); (4) neutral prompt vs. guiding system prompt (i.e., \u201cConsider my personal risks, sensitivities and constraints when you make recommendations for me\" appended to start of recommendation question); and (5) switching the user and first person's preferences/constraints."}, {"title": "3.3 EVALUATION METRICS", "content": "We used an external model, LLaMA 3.1. 405B (Instruct), to evaluate the AI assistants' responses, feeding it a reduced version of the conversation (without the distraction elements), only containing the user's mentioning of their safety-critical constraint, their recommendation request, and the model's response. Evaluation ratings were either 0 (Fail): the assistant's response fails to account for the critical personal information shared in the first turn; 1 (Unclear): the assistant's response is evasive, generic, or otherwise ambiguous as to its appropriateness, making it unclear whether the personal fact was considered or, if so, handled appropriately; or 2 (Pass): the assistant explicitly acknowledges the critical personal information and provides an appropriately considerate recommendation. For this initial study, we were only interested in whether the model accounted at all for the relevant information (as our benchmark only dealt with clearly harmful, insensitive or risky cases), rather than the extent to which it shows appropriate nuance. Hence, pass rates were treated as a binary, and ambiguous results underwent further processing to understand what led to them.\nNote that, to pass, it is not required that the model actively recommends against the activity, but only that a recognition of, and appropriate consideration for, the safety-critical constraint is shown. This is to ensure that ambiguous cases, where the user's constraint is not necessarily inhibiting (e.g., if the request is about eating bread with a severe gluten allergy), the model should at least mention to the user to consider the constraint (e.g., to do so only if a gluten-free alternative is available)."}, {"title": "3.4 EVALUATION PROCESS", "content": "Each scenario was processed in parallel using its own script, with all the ablations in a separate script. For each input in a given case study, variables outside the key context (i.e., the trivia questions, unrelated personal facts about the user, and the unrelated preferences of other actors in Scenario 5) were randomised. For the ablations, these were randomised between iterations, but each iteration used the same variables across all ablations to limit confounding factors. A retry mechanism (3 retry attempts per model, sleeping up to 20 seconds) was implemented to handle potential API rate limits.\nAmbiguous results were analysed separately to uncover their causes. From a manual read-through of the results, we identified three exclusive and exhaustive factors that captured reasons for responses rated as ambiguous: (1) generic response, i.e., the model's recommendation considers the user's safety in a seemingly generic way, without referencing their particular constraint; (2) wrong despite noticing, i.e., the model recommends the harmful activity despite acknowledging the particular way it puts the user at risk; and (3) evading question, i.e., the model gives no recommendation or says it is unable to. We wrote a script using the same evaluator model, LLaMA 3.1 405B (Instruct) that categorises the data according to the above descriptions (with natural language explanations for each categorisation), and statistically analyses the results also on GitHub."}, {"title": "4 RESULTS", "content": "4.1 MODEL PERFORMANCE ACROSS SCENARIOS\nFigure 2 shows the mean results (passing and ambiguous scores, stacked) across all scenarios for a selection of six leading models. The standard error was calculated across three seeds, for all models excluding 01-Preview (due to financial constraints). Results for all ten models are in Appendix A. LLAMA 3.1 405B demonstrated superior performance overall (mean=88.4%, SE\u00a11%), followed by 01-Preview (85.5%) and LLaMA 3 70B Instruct (82.5%). Performance consistently declined as scenario complexity increased, with mean scores dropping from 75.1% in Scenario 1 (no added persons) to 43.2% in Scenario 4 (three conflicting preferences).\nAll models performed best on Scenario 1, the simplest case with only one person. Some larger models achieved high accuracy on this (mean scores between 93.9% and 99.5%), whilst GPT-3.5 Turbo (27.9%, SE=2.1%) and LLaMA 3 70B base model (15.6%, SE=1.0%) struggled significantly.\nThis suggests that for these models, the trivia questions and/or unrelated user preferences may have been enough to interfere with their ability to attend to the relevant safety-critical user information.\nThe introduction of the conflicting preferences of a second person in Scenario 2 led to a significant performance drop across all models (mean decrease of 22.4 percentage points), demonstrating the models' difficulty distinguishing between hard constraints (e.g., \u201ca severe peanut allergy\") and softer preferences (e.g., \u201cloving Pad Thai\u201d). The mean performance of even the strongest model, LLaMA 3.1 405B, dropped 14.9%. This is concerning for two reasons: (a) Our benchmark represents the simplest case of reasoning about multi-person preferences and safety, with clear-cut correct answers, meaning that models would likely fare even worse in more nuanced and complex scenarios; and (b) a 15% error rate is unacceptably high when the consequences for the user could be severe.\nPerformance continued to steadily decline in Scenarios 3 and 4 as more conflicting preferences were introduced (mean scores of 46.6% and 43.2% respectively), indicating a bias for prioritising the preferences of the many over the risks to the few. This trend was particularly pronounced for models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, which saw its performance drop from 73.8% (SE 0.57%) in Scenario 1 to 31.86% (SE 1.80%) in Scenario 4, whereas GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance deteriorated dramatically to near-zero (0.9%, SE=0.2%). The performance gap between the strongest and weakest models was substantial. While LLaMA 3.1 405B maintained relatively robust performance across all scenarios (range: 78.4%-99.5%), models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and LLaMA 3 70B base model showed severe degradation in more complex scenarios (falling to \u00a12% accuracy).\nInterestingly, Scenario 5, which introduced random, non-conflicting preferences, generally proved significantly easier than Scenarios 2-4. This confirms that the explicitly conflicting preferences of others caused performance degradation, rather than the mere introduction of additional preferences.\""}, {"title": "4.2 ANALYSIS OF AMBIGUOUS RESULTS", "content": "Figure 2 also illustrates the mean rate of ambiguous results for each model across the five scenarios. Mixtral 8x7B demonstrated the highest overall ambiguity rate at 16.62%, with GPT-3.5 Turbo second (10.68%).\nBetween scenarios, 1 and 5 showed the highest overall ambiguity rates (15.92% and 18.05% respectively), while ambiguity rates generally decreased through scenarios 2-4 (from 11.47% to 5.44%). This pattern correlates with the models' overall success rates across scenarios, possibly because models are more likely to inadequately account for the constraint if they are able to take it into account in the first place. However, across models, the three with the highest success rates had the lowest amount of ambiguous responses: LLaMA 3 70B and LLaMA 3.1 405B's were lowest (0.30% and 0.89% respectively), with o1-Preview at 2.97%, indicating that a high pass rate correlated with helpfulness (effectively adaping recommendations to the constraint) and clarity.\nAmong the categories of factors leading to ambiguous results, \u2018generic response' dominated across all scenarios, accounting for 77% of ambiguous cases. The rest were mainly wrong-despite-noticing responses (23%), suggesting that models struggled most with appropriately weighing multiple conflicting preferences. Only one response was categorised as evading the question (in this case, going on an unrelated tangent). This is to be expected, as responses of this category should usually be caught by the main evaluator as evasive responses typically fail to explicitly mention the user-specific risk (due to model safety guardrails preventing a relevant response altogether).\nFurther analysis revealed that the 'physical constraints' category resulted in the biggest overall proportion of generic responses across scenarios, with particularly strong effects in scenarios 1 and 5. Generic responses may have resulted from the sorts of activities mentioned in recommendation requests, which often involved physically demanding activities (e.g., \"I have COPD that makes breathing difficult ... Do you think I should attempt to climb"}, {"title": "4.3 ABLATION STUDIES", "content": "Our ablation studies, which we did on a selection of six models on Scenario 3 (user + 2 actors with conflicting preferences), revealed critical insight into model bias and behaviour. Firstly, HH prompting proved inadequate for these user-specific risks (mean average 51.5%, SE 1.1%), even for the most basic examples and within the context window. In contrast, adding a guiding prompt dramatically improved performance (94.6% success, SE 0.9%), with LLaMA models achieving 100% accuracy. Secondly, we observed a strong primacy bias across all models; performance decreased significantly when critical constraints were placed mid-conversation, with Mixtral 8x7B and LLaMA 3 70B showing the largest declines (-10.9% and -10.8% respectively), whilst GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance plummeted to 0%. Thirdly, using less biased phrasing in recommendation requests improved mean performance from 47.8% (SE 1.5%) to 55.3% (SE 1.6%), highlighting models' susceptibility to leading questions. Finally, role reversal produced stark contrasts: LLaMA 3.1 405B dropping from 84.9% to 64.9%, GPT-3.5 Turbo improved from 1.3% to 42.4%, whilst LLaMA 3 70B remained consistent (72.5% to 72.7%). These results underscore"}, {"title": "5 DISCUSSION", "content": "significant challenges in achieving consistent personalised alignment, revealing concerning variability in models' ability to balance user safety against the desires of others, and vice versa. Moreover, they demonstrate the significant effect of prompt design, information placement, and perspective on effective personalised alignment. Individual pairwise comparisons of each ablation are included in Appendix A.\nCURATE represents an important initial step towards assessing language models' capacity to align their behaviours with user-specific, safety-critical information in ongoing conversations. Our results reveal dangerous systematic biases across leading models, particularly in effectively prioritising hard constraints and soft preferences, and in maintaining a balance between agreeability and user safety. These findings underscore the urgent need to fundamentally rethink alignment strategies towards more nuanced and personalised risk assessment.\n5.1 THE INADEQUACIES OF THE 'HELPFUL AND HARMLESS' FRAMEWORK\nOur research exposes critical shortcomings in the widely-adopted \u2018helpful and harmless' (HH) criteria for LLM alignment. Firstly, the HH framework's approach's focus on isolated input-response pairs fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of multi-turn conversations. This oversight is particularly problematic when dealing with user-specific sensitivities or constraints, what may be called 'pragmatic risks' Alberts et al. (2024a); Kasirzadeh & Gabriel (2023). The HH framework's rather generic approach to \u201charmfulness\u201d is inadequate for effectively handling behaviours that may be benign in most contexts but potentially harmful in specific user scenarios. This inadequacy is illustrated by the relatively modest improvement in model performance on CURATE when a 'be helpful and harmless' prompt was introduced. More alarmingly, our findings reveal a pernicious form of sycophancy in models primed for agreeableness. This manifests as a systematic drop in model performance when actors with strong, but non-safety-critical preferences are introduced, with models exhibiting a systematic bias for prioritising the desires of others over critical user constraints. This effect strengthened as more actors with the same conflicting preferences are introduced, also indicating a sort of 'Bandwagon Effect' bias to become more agreeable to risky preferences as group sizes increase.\nImportantly, the same systematic biases were observed in OpenAI's ol-Preview model with advanced reasoning capabilities. Whilst it outperformed GPT 40, it was not the best overall. This indicates that performing well on generic reasoning tasks does not necessarily generalise to contextual thinking required for even the most basic safety-critical user-specific recommendations.\nOverall, we maintain that the HH framework's notion of 'harmlessness' is fundamentally flawed. No behaviour can be guaranteed harmless across all contexts, and the use of this term may engender a false sense of security, potentially fostering unwarranted trust in model outputs. This issue is a direct consequence of the broader RLHF approach, which optimises for general likeability rather than context-specific critical thinking.\n5.2 IMPLICATIONS FOR AI SAFETY: TOWARDS ROBUST PERSONALISED ALIGNMENT\nWhilst our task-specific guiding prompt (\"Consider my personal risks, sensitivities and constraints when making recommendations to me\") significantly boosted performance across all models, this high-level approach is likely insufficient for personalised alignment in the general case. Our experimental setup deliberately employed clear-cut tasks with all relevant information within the context window. Real-world scenarios, however, often demand far more nuanced judgments, accounting for more or less contextually relevant information revealed across extended interactions.\nPersonalised alignment also goes beyond the relevance and safety of recommendations, but includes being mindful of a range of user sensitivities and preferences regarding how to be addressed, spoken to, or treated. Beyond putting people in danger, Alberts et al. (2024a)'s taxonomy of interactional harms shows how seemingly benign or even helpful behaviours can be demeaning, or how negative effects can be cumulative (e.g., an innocuous behaviour becoming rude if repeated), further underscoring the importance of context-specific awareness."}, {"title": "6 LIMITATIONS", "content": "To develop more sophisticated and reliable approaches to conversational AI alignment, particularly for long-term user interactions, we propose addressing several key factors:\n1.  Enhanced contextual attention: We must radically improve models' ability to focus on and prioritise relevant contextual information. This requires enhancing current RLHF and auto-alignment strategies with complex multi-turn conversation evaluation so that models learn to (a) reliably account for user-specific safety-critical information and (b) adeptly weigh conflicting needs, constraints, and preferences. This may be supported with relevant individual-centred system prompts and fine-tuning on diverse conversation examples.\n2.  Dynamic user modelling: We advocate for the development of cognitively-inspired approaches to dynamically construct and update 'mental models' of specific users over time. These models may be structured around core categories of interests (e.g., preferences, constraints, personal information) and include domain relevance cues for efficient information retrieval and application.\n3.  Hierarchical information retention: While some leading models like ChatGPT have begun incorporating strategies for retaining a working memory of prior interactions Gong et al. (2024), this information remains relatively unstructured as a collection of potentially relevant insights. Future work must focus on developing sophisticated hierarchical and domain-specific utility structures for retained information, ensuring that critical user-specific data is not just stored, but appropriately prioritised and applied.\nBy addressing these crucial aspects, we can start moving towards robust personalised alignment strategies. This is not just desirable, but essential for the development of AI assistants capable of safe and constructive long-term interactions with users. Our work with CURATe is a first step towards this vital shift in AI alignment research and development, particularly for the new generation of agentic AI assistants that assist and act on behalf of individuals with complex combinations of personal preferences, needs and constraints.\nOur study is limited by the size and rigid structure of our benchmark dataset, as well as the specific scenarios and categories we tested. Future work should cover a broader range of personalisation challenges in organic, open-ended conversations that go beyond the context length, and evaluate the relative efficacy of different routes to achieving the desired capacities, as those we outlined."}, {"title": "7 CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating personalised alignment in LLM-based dialogue agents.

All entries were then manually checked by hand to ensure diversity, relevance, and accuracy. Using hand-edited LLM-generated content allowed for the relatively quick generation of several examples with diverse phrasings, keeping the content and loose structure similar.\nPhrasings were kept consistent between scenarios (i.e., just changing \"I\" to \u201cwe\u201d if recommendation request was for one or more people) to ensure comparability. Within each scenario, however, phrasings were diversified, with recommendation requests following more or less straightforwardly from the user constraint-being explicitly contained in the request, or merely implied.

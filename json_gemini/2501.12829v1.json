Traditional load balancing mechanisms, such as Round Robin (RR) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR), are static and often struggle to adapt to fluctuating traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies in network performance. In contrast, SDNs offer centralized control and flexibility, providing an ideal platform for implementing machine learning-driven optimization strategies. The core of this research combines a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for accurate traffic prediction with a DQN model to perform real-time dynamic load balancing. The TFT model predicts future traffic loads, which the DQN uses as input, allowing it to make intelligent routing decisions that optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce packet loss. The proposed model was tested against RR and WRR in simulated environments with varying data rates, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in network performance. For the 500MB data rate, the DQN model achieved an average throughput of 0.275 compared to 0.202 and 0.205 for RR and WRR, respectively. Additionally, the DQN recorded lower average latency and packet loss. In the 1000MB simulation, the DQN model outperformed the traditional methods in throughput, latency, and packet loss, reinforcing its effectiveness in managing network loads dynamically.

While traditional load balancing techniques such as Round Robin (RR) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) are effective in certain scenarios, they fail to adapt to dynamic and highly variable traffic patterns in complex network environments[4], [5], [9], [13]. To overcome these limitations, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being adopted, offering real-time traffic prediction and dynamic load distribution, resulting in more intelligent and adaptive load balancing solutions[10].

Fat-Tree Topology", "content": "The fat-tree topology is a widely adopted network architecture in data canters, designed to overcome the limitations of traditional tree topologies, such as bottlenecks and single points of failure. It is structured as a multistage, hierarchical network consisting of three levels: core, aggregation, and edge layers. The key feature of the fat-tree is that the bandwidth remains consistent across each layer, achieved by ensuring that each layer has an equal number of connections to the layer above it. This architecture allows for high scalability and uniform bandwidth distribution, making it ideal for environments with high traffic demands [28]."}, {"title": "B. Round Robin and Weighted Round Robin Algorithms", "content": "Round Robin (RR) and Weighted Round Robin (WRR) are two fundamental algorithms used for load balancing in network systems. The Round Robin algorithm distributes traffic evenly across servers or network paths by cycling through them in a fixed order, making it simple and easy to implement. However, RR does not account for the differing capabilities or current load of each server, which can lead to inefficiencies in scenarios with varying resource demands. Weighted Round Robin, an enhancement of RR, assigns different weights to each server or path based on their capacity or performance characteristics. This allows for a more balanced distribution of traffic, as servers with higher capacities can handle more requests. Despite its improvements over RR, WRR still has limitations, such as difficulty in adapting to real-time changes in server performance or load, and the complexity of determining appropriate weights, which can impact its effectiveness in dynamic environments.."}, {"title": "C. Time Series Traffic", "content": "Time series traffic refers to the modeling and analysis of network traffic data that is collected and observed sequentially over time. In network environments, traffic data typically exhibits temporal patterns, where the traffic load at any given moment is influenced by past events and trends. These patterns can include hourly or daily cycles, periodic spikes, and long-term trends that need to be captured accurately for effective network management. Time series analysis in network traffic is crucial for understanding traffic dynamics, detecting anomalies, and making informed decisions about resource allocation and load balancing. Techniques such as autoregressive models, moving averages, and more recently, advanced deep learning models like Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), are used to predict future traffic loads based on historical data. Accurately forecasting time series traffic helps in anticipating congestion, optimizing routing paths, and improving overall network performance by enabling proactive management strategies[30]."}, {"title": "D. Multi-Step Traffic Prediction", "content": "Multi-step traffic prediction involves forecasting network traffic over multiple future time steps, rather than predicting a single future point. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where network management requires planning over extended periods, such as in dynamic load balancing, capacity planning, and congestion control. In multi-step prediction, the accuracy of the forecast becomes progressively more challenging as the prediction horizon extends, due to the compounding of errors and the increasing uncertainty over time. To address this, models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) are employed to capture long-term dependencies and trends in the data. Multi-step predictions can be done using either direct methods, where separate models are trained for each prediction step, or recursive methods, where a single model predicts one step ahead and the prediction is fed back into the model for subsequent steps. Effective multi-step traffic prediction allows network administrators to better anticipate and manage future traffic conditions, leading to more efficient and resilient network operations[31], [32]."}, {"title": "E.

{"title": "Self-supervised Spatio-Temporal Graph Mask-Passing Attention Network for Perceptual Importance Prediction of Multi-point Tactility", "authors": ["Dazhong He", "Qian Liu"], "abstract": "While visual and auditory information are prevalent in modern multimedia systems, haptic interaction, e.g., tactile and kinesthetic interaction, provides a unique form of human perception. However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Haptic multimedia technology, crucial for immersive experiences, is still developing [17]. It provides haptic feedback through capturing, compressing, transmitting, and displaying haptic information. This work focuses on the compression of tactile information. Although single-point tactile interaction data is currently small compared to audio and video data, the future will likely see a shift towards multi-point interaction scenarios. Tens of interaction points achieve a data rate of Mbit/s [14], but this is still not enough for high fidelity. In order to meet the needs of realistic large-area contact perception of human skin surface, the number of interaction points can reach thousands [16]. Increasing the number of interaction points leads to a sharp increase in data rate, making tactile data compression a clear necessity [14]. Spatial compression algorithms are needed in multi-point scenarios [17]."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Existing tactile codecs like PVC-LSP [6] and VC-PWQ [14] use psychophysical perceptual models to maintain perception quality at a low data rate. However, existing perceptual models only consider frequency domain perceptual characteristics for single interaction point [16], overlooking multi-point spatially distributed interactions. In fact, the masking effect also occurs in the time domain and in the spatial domain between different interaction points in multi-point tactile interactions. Therefore, developing perceptual models for multi-point tactile scenes is a promising direction, as it can guide compression encoding, communication resource scheduling, and other related applications. The challenge in developing multipoint tactile perceptual models is how to analyze perceptual masking over time, frequency, and spatial domains of multiple interaction points. In this work, we specifically focus on fine roughness (which gives rise to vibrotactile perception and is exemplified in the hand) and its perceptual model.\nThe multi-point perceptual model can be implemented in the form of inputting a multivariate time series of tactile signals formed by each interaction point and outputting the importance index of each. The \"Importance Index\" represents perceptual criticality as a classification probability, abstracting this into a multivariate time series classification problem. Interaction points form a graph structure in multi-point tactile interaction, with nodes characterized by tactile time series and connected through hidden dependencies. This making it natural to view the problem from a graph perspective. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have made some achievements in processing graph data. They propagate information within the graph, allowing each node to learn about its surroundings. Particularly, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs), handling spatio-temporal data modeling tasks, provide future predictions or category labels based on input time series and optional external graph structure, making them effective for constructing multi-point tactile perceptual models.\nIn this paper, we propose a deep learning model, the Self-supervised Spatio-Temporal Graph Mask-Passing Attention Network (SSTGMPAN), to predict perceptual importance based on vibrotactile time series signals as inputs from each node in multi-point interaction. It uses a novel temporal-spectral mask-passing attention mechanism for capturing the temporal-spectral masking dynamics between nodes and self-supervised learning for improved data utilization and model generalization, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling."}, {"title": "2.1 Vibrotactile Perceptual Model and Its Applications", "content": "Human tactile perception involves sensing body surfaces and perceiving external stimuli, including friction, hardness, temperature, and roughness [15]. Surface roughness perception depends on roughness fineness. Macroroughness involves visible height profiles on the object surface and its regularity [17]. Fine roughness, or microscopic roughness, results from high-frequency vibration when body parts slide on the object surface.\nIn single-point tactile perception, temporal and frequency masking occur [16]. Temporal masking reduces sensitivity over time due to a strong stimulus, while frequency masking raises the threshold around a dominant frequency. In multi-point tactile perception, spatial masking occurs, where stimulation at one interaction point increases"}, {"title": "2.2 Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network", "content": "Traditional GNN struggle with dynamic spatio-temporal data.

The two branches share a common encoder, i.e., a temporal-spectral mask-passing encoder. The SSL branch is essentially a masked autoencoder [7].\nWe use wavelet packet transform (WPT) as a pre-processing step to convert the original time series data $X_{orig} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times T_{orig}}$ into a new feature representation $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F \\times T}$.

We use an attention mechanism to adaptively capture the dynamic mutual influence correlations between nodes in spectral and temporal dimensions.\nWe treat any node $v_i \\in V$ as a central node that receives masking influence information from its neighborhood $N(v_i)$. For the node $v_i$ and any node in its neighborhood $v_j \\in N(v_i)$, they have the feature $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times T}$, $x_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times T}$.\nWe first compute their spectral representations $F_i$ and $F_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times T}$, and their temporal representations $T_i$ and $T_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times F}$. They are defined as:\n$F_i = x_iW_Q^F, F_j = x_jW_K^F$ (4)\n$T_i = x_iW_Q^T, T_j = x_jW_K^T$ (5)\nwhere $W_Q^F, W_K^F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ and $W_Q^T, W_K^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times F}$ are learnable weights, with $W_Q^F$ lower triangular and $W_K^F$ upper triangular to ensure causality. Each column $F_i[:, t]$ in the spectrum representation $F_i$ indicates that the neighbor effect of node i at time step t only impacts subsequent time steps. Each column $F_j[:, t]$ in the spectrum representation $F_j$ indicates the influence of node j on other nodes at time step t is the combined effect of all previous time steps. Next, we define attention coefficients $aF_{ij}$ and $aT_{ij}$ as follows:\n$aF_{ij} = softmax(\\frac{F_i W_F F_j^T}{\\sqrt{d_T}}), aT_{ij} = softmax(\\frac{T_i W_T T_j^T}{\\sqrt{d_F}})$ (6)\nwhere $aF_{ij}$ represents the spectral attention between nodes i and j, and $aT_{ij}$ represents the temporal attention between nodes i and j. To enhance the representation ability, the learnable matrices $W_F$ and $W_T$ are added, where $W_F$ is a lower triangular matrix to ensure that node i at a specific time step t is only affected by node j before time step t. For the same purpose, when calculating $aT_{ij}$, a mask operation precedes the softmax operation.\nWe formulate a mask-passing strategy that involves weighted aggregation of node features considering both spectral and temporal dimensions. To stabilize learning process, we use multiple heads of attention and integrate their output using 1\u00d71 convolution, delaying the application of the final nonlinearity. Finally, the mask-passing operator is defined as:\n$E_{i \\leftarrow N(i)} = Convo_{1x1}(\\left[\\left[\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} aF_{ij} \\cdot (x_jW_V) \\cdot aT_{ij}\\right]\\right]_k^K)$ (7)"}, {"title": "3.4 Global Spatial Attention", "content": "Inspired by [5], we define a global spatial attention mechanism as an attention matrix $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$, representing node association strength and capturing spatial correlation.

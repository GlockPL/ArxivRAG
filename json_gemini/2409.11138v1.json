Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNS) and in particular Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) have emerged as a mechanism to incorporate structural inductive bias into the NN model. By ensuring physical invariances are conserved, the models exhibit significantly better sample complexity and out of distribution accuracy than standard NNs. Learning the Hamiltonian as a function of its canonical variables, typically position and velocity, from sample observations of the system thus becomes a critical task in system identification and long-term prediction of system behavior. However, in order to truly preserve the long run physical conservation properties of Hamiltonian systems, one must use symplectic integrators for a forward pass of the system's simulation. While symplectic schemes have been used in the literature, they are thus far limited to situations when they reduce to explicit algorithms, which include the case of separable Hamiltonians or augmented non-separable Hamiltonians. In general, symplectic integrators are implicit in nature, making backpropagation challenging. Noting the self-adjoint property of symplectic integration, we propose a method for incorporating one integrator for the forward and backward pass in order to perform training on the NN trajectories. We use a predictor-corrector method to warm start the procedure, easing the computational challenges of solving an implicit symplectic integrator. We show that the method is robust to noise and provides a good approximation of the system Hamiltonian when the state variables are sampled from a noisy observation. Our method unlike previous works assumes a single generic Hamiltonian structure which after training can be used to capture long-term behavior of systems governed by complex dynamics as well as modeling the evolution from different input data. In the numerical results, we show the performance of the method with respect to Hamiltonian reconstruction and conservation, indicating its particular advantage for non-separable systems.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism is standard in mathematical physics for expressing dynamics in many physical systems. Beyond leading to reliable schemes to derive ODE dynamics of the system, there are deep structural, geometric, topological, and analytic properties of the Hamiltonian and Lagrangians functions that can be used to understand the system and its dynamics (Marsden and Ratiu 1999). The Lagrangian L = T \u2013 U is the difference of the kinetic and potential energy, and the action is a functional of the curve q : [0,T] \u2192 Q that is given by $\\int_0^T L(q, \\dot{q})dt$, and the dynamics is given by the extremizer of the action functional. The stationarity of the action yields the Euler-Langrange equations, a second-order ODE that describes the dynamics. By contrast, when the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocities, the Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies and coincides with the total energy, and the Hamilton's equations for the dynamics is a system of first-order ODEs. As demonstrated in (Bou-Rabee and Marsden 2009), symplectic integrators exhibit excellent preservation of chaotic invariant sets, even with coarse timesteps, which is in contrast to non-geometric methods. This phenomena can be understood in terms of a KAM theorem for symplectic algorithms, as discussed in (Feng and Qin 2010). These results indicate that symplectic discretizations are particularly valuable for capturing the qualitative properties of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. As such, by learning the Hamiltonian itself rather than to seek to learn trajectories, we are able to learn properties of the system without the impossible task of numerical handling the sensitivity of such systems.\nIf the Hamiltonian is time-invariant, then the Noether quantity associated with time-translational symmetry is conserved along the flow. This implies many important conservation properties across physical systems of interest. However, non-geometric methods, such as the Euler and explicit Runge-Kutta methods do not generally conserve the Hamiltonian over larger time scales (Hairer, Lubich, and Wanner 2006), and this phenomenon inspired the development of energy-preserving and symplectic integration schemes to circumvent this problem. A result in (Zhong and Marsden 1988) shows that it is not generally possible for a fixed-timestep integrator to simultaneously preserve the energy and the symplectic structure, so for remainder of this paper, we will focus on symplectic integrators, since they exhibit excellent near energy conservation for exponentially long times via a backward error analysis result (Reich 1999). A method is said to be symplectic if it preserves the canonical symplectic form, $w = \\sum_{i=1}^n dp_i \\wedge dq^i$; see subsequent sections and also (Channell and Scovel 1990). Geometric integrators preserve geometric invariants of the flow, and the use of such integrators have been instrumental in understanding the long-term quali-"}, {"title": "Background", "content": "Dynamics of Hamiltonian Mechanics\nPhysical systems may be described by either Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics. Both are powerful formalisms that provides unified frameworks for describing the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, from simple harmonic oscillators to complex celestial bodies. By expressing the state of a system in terms of generalized coordinates and momenta, and defining the system's energy as a function of these variables, the equations of motion can be derived in a systematic manner. This approach reveals the structure and conservation laws of the system, such as the conservation of energy and symplectic structure, which play a crucial role in understanding its long-term behavior and stability. Furthermore, since Hamilton's equations is a system of first-order differential equations, the trajectory has a geometric interpretation as the integral curve of a vector field on phase space.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in incorporating the principles of Hamiltonian mechanics into the design of neural networks, giving rise to the field of Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) (Greydanus, Dzamba, and Yosinski 2019); see next section. Mathematically, by constructing neural networks that respect the symplectic structure and conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems, HNNs can learn and generalize from data in a more physically meaningful and interpretable way which is critical for tasks such as modeling and control of complex dynamical systems.\nLet $(M,w)$ be a symplectic manifold, where $M$ is a 2d-dimensional smooth manifold and $w$ is a closed, non-degenerate 2-form on $M$. Let $(q,p) = (q_1,..., q_d, p_1,..., p_d)$ be a system of canonical coordinates on $M$, such that $M$ can be viewed locally as a cotangent bundle $T^*Q$, where $Q$ is a configuration manifold, and the symplectic form $w$ can be expressed as:\n$w = \\sum_{i=1}^d dq^i \\wedge dp_i$. (1)\nThe kinetic energy $T : \\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\times TQ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and the potential energy $U: Q \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ are assumed to be smooth functions. The Lagrangian function $L : \\mathbb{R}_{>0} \\times TQ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as:\n$L(t, q, \\dot{q}) = T(t, q, \\dot{q}) \u2013 U(q)$,\nand the action functional $S : C^2([t_0, t_1], Q) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as:\n$S[q] = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} L(t, q(t), \\dot{q}(t))dt$.\nThen, the dynamics of the system is governed by Hamilton's principle:\n$\\delta S[q] = 0$,\nfor all variations $\\delta q(t)$ of $q(t)$ that vanish at the endpoints, i.e., $\\delta q(t_0) = \\delta q(t_1) = 0$. This yields the Euler-Lagrange equations:\n$\\frac{d}{dt} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q_i}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i} = 0, \\text{ for } i = 1,..., d$. (2)\nThese dynamics can be described in terms of the Hamiltonian formulation using the Hamiltonian and the symplectic form (1), which are geometric objects that are invariants of the flow. This makes the Hamiltonian approach a particularly desirable way of constructing data-driven models that respect the geometric properties of the underlying dynamical system."}, {"title": "Symplectic HNNS", "content": "We introduce the Legendre transform $FL: TQ \\rightarrow T^*Q$, $(q, \\dot{q}) \\rightarrow (q, \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}})$. This leads to the conjugate momenta,\n$p_k = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_k} \\text{ for } k = 1,...,d$.\nThe Hamiltonian function $H : T^*Q \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as:\n$H(q, p) = \\sum_{k=1}^d p_k\\dot{q}_k \u2013 L(q, \\dot{q})$, (3)\nwhere $\\dot{q}_k$ is expressed as a function of $(q,p)$ by inverting Legendre transform. Equivalently, the dependence on the velocities on the right-hand side can be eliminated by extremizing with respect to the velocities, which is analogous to the approach adopted in Pontryagin's maximum principle. Given H, we can define a unique vector field $X_H$ on $T^*Q$, the Hamiltonian vector field, by the condition\n$dH = \\omega(X_H, .)$.\nThe Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ takes the form\n$X_H = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i}$ (5)\nThe integral curves of $X_H$ are the solutions to Hamilton's equations\n$\\dot{p_i} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_i}, \\quad \\dot{q_i} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_i} \\text{ for } i = 1,..., d$.\nWhile we have derived Hamilton's equations using local canonical coordinates, (4) defines a global vector field on M. These equations describe the flow of the system in phase space and are equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equations (2) derived from Hamilton's principle if the Legendre transform is globally invertible and the Lagrangian L is related to the Hamiltonian H by (3).\nFor completeness, the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation,\n$\\frac{d}{dt} S + H(q, \\frac{d}{dq}S) = 0$,\ndescribes the generating function S for the canonical transformation, that maps $(q(t_0),p(t_0))$ to $(q(t_1),p(t_1))$. This provides an alternative method for solving Hamilton's equations (Abraham and Marsden 1978), and Jacobi's solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is given in terms of the action functional evaluated along the solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations.\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian Neural Networks\nRef. (Greydanus, Dzamba, and Yosinski 2019) introduced Hamiltonian Neural Networks, a class of neural networks that can learn arbitrary Hamiltonian functions of a given physical system. Given the canonical coordinates $q = (q_1,\\ldots,q_d)^T$, $p = (p_1,\\ldots,p_d)^T$, these are given as input to a neural network, and the following loss is optimized :\n$\\mathcal{L}(p,q, \\Theta) = ||\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\frac{dq}{dt}||_F^2 + ||\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} + \\frac{dp}{dt}||_F^2$\nwhere F denotes the Frobenius norm and Hamilton's equations\n$\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}, \\quad \\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}$, (6)\nare computed using backpropagation based on the input coordinates, and the time derivatives are considered targets recorded from the data. Once the Hamiltonian is learned, the dynamics are generated using external integrators that integrate Hamilton's equations for the learned Hamiltonian encoded in the HNN.\nSimilarly, Ref. (Cranmer et al. 2020) introduced Lagrangian Neural Networks, a class of NNs that can learn arbitrary Lagrangian functions of a given physics system. The coordinates are $q = (q_1,\\ldots, q_d)^T$, $\\dot{q} = (\\dot{q}_1,\\ldots, \\dot{q}_d)^T$ In (Greydanus, Dzamba, and Yosinski 2019), the residual error for a first-order gradient is optimized, however, in this, the residual error for a second-order gradient is optimized :\n$\\ddot{q} = (\\nabla_{\\dot{q}} \\nabla_{\\dot{q}}^T L)^{-1}(\\nabla_q L \u2013 (\\nabla_q \\nabla_{\\dot{q}}^T L)\\dot{q})$,\nwhich is obtained by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations (2) for $\\ddot{q}$. Once the Lagrangian is learned, an external integrator is used to integrate the Euler-Lagrange equations for the learned Lagrangian function.\nGenerally, calculating the loss gradients for network training is a difficult task when the loss is a function of the system state, which is in turn governed by an ODE. Formally, the Empirical Risk minimization problem is defined as minimizing the approximate Real Risk\n$\\mathbb{E} := \\mathbb{E}e(t) [||q-q_{gt}-e(t)||^2 + ||p-p_{gt}-e(t)||^2]$,\nwith, q = q(0, t), p = p(0, t) and e(t) = B(t), a Brownian motion (thus resulting in normal-valued samples). We approximate this in training to data by minimizing the Empirical Risk over data {$q_{t,n}, p_{t,n}$}t\u2208[T],n\u2208[N], defined to be,\n$E_N(p,q) := \\frac{1}{NT}\\sum_{t=0}^T \\sum_{n=0}^N ||p-q_{t,n}||^2 - ||p-q_{t,n}||^2 $. (7)\nHowever, given that a neural network defines a function that ultimately defines a system of ODEs, the optimization problem contains constraints:\n$ \\begin{aligned} &\\text{minimize } \\mathbb{E}_N(\\theta) \\\\ &\\theta \\\\ &\\text{subject to }  \\dot{q}(t, \\theta) - \\frac{\\partial H(\\theta, q, p)}{\\partial p} = 0, \\\\ & \\dot{p}(t, \\theta) + \\frac{\\partial H(\\theta, q, p)}{\\partial q} = 0. \\end{aligned} $ (8)\nWe seek to minimize this loss function w.r.t. model parameters 0. However, in order to do so, we need to compute the numerical simulation of an ODE system with the right-hand side defined by partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian with respect to canonical variables p and q. In order to perform inference and compute the backpropagation, the composition of a numerical integrator, viewed as an operator, will be required. This presents the primary technical challenge that has"}, {"title": "Symplectic Integration in NNs: Previous Work", "content": "spawned the design of various algorithms meant to perform this with both accuracy and computational tractability.\nParticularly for such optimization problems, the space complexity of gradient computation w.r.t. the parameters using the standard backpropagation scales with timesteps. This makes it computationally expensive to store the gradients in the memory while solving for complex Hamiltonians over longer timescales. By eschewing the classical end-to-end backpropagation approach in favor of inputting a symplectic integrator into the computation, this scaling issue can be partially ameliorated.\nSymplectic Integration in NNs: Previous Work\nSince the original proposal by (Greydanus, Dzamba, and Yosinski 2019) and the concurrent work by (Bertalan et al. 2019), HNNs have generated much scientific interest. This has spawned generative (Toth et al. 2019), recurrent (Chen et al. 2019), and constrained (Zhong, Dey, and Chakraborty 2019) versions, as well as Lagrangian Neural Networks (Cranmer et al. 2020) have been proposed. Most of these works considered either explicit integration schemes, some nearly implicit schemes, or used a separable ansatz for the Neural Nets.\n(Chen et al. 2019), in contrast to HNNs, directly optimize the actual states observed at each time step for a given initialization by integrating the partial derivatives using a symplectic integrator (leapfrog algorithm) and backpropagating each squared error through time. The state at the next time step is predicted using the symplectic integrator, in this way the entire time series is predicted, which is then compared with observed states. Note that they make the assumption that the Hamiltonian is separable, which is significant as the leapfrog algorithm is generally implicit, but if the Hamiltonian is separable, then the algorithm becomes explicit.\n(Xiong et al. 2020) proposes a generalized HNN framework, which can be used for non-separable Hamiltonians where they approximate the original non-separable Hamiltonian by an Augmented one, proposed in (Tao 2016) with an extended phase space and a tunable parameter w which controls the binding between the two copies of Hamiltonian and model them using NNs. They propose an in-place symplectic integration scheme for the dynamics. The assumption of Augmented Hamiltonian leads to increased complexity with regards to adjusting the binding parameters. As before, the use of the algorithm in (Tao 2016) is motivated by the fact that it is explicit even for non-separable Hamiltonians.\nOur work bypasses this by introducing a single generic Network for the parametrized Hamiltonian with fully symplectic integration schemes to predict the system dynamics with computational benefit that they are self-adjoint, and so the solution of the adjoint system can be computed using a very simple lift of the integrator."}, {"title": "Fully Symplectic Hamiltonian Neural Network", "content": "Fully Symplectic Hamiltonian Neural Network\nConsider the generic problem of learning a Hamiltonian H(q,p) from data, that is, noisy observations. We may choose to parametrize it, consider H(0; q, p), where 0 \u2208 Rd are the parameters of a neural network such that the Hamiltonian is some function of the three arguments. We can also consider the system identification problem of knowing the functional form of the Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian) but not the specific parameter values. Inference in the network, for given trained 0*, amounts to providing a value of q and p with an output depending on 0*.\nOne simulates the Hamiltonian dynamics by computing gradients of H with respect to q and p, then applying a numerical integrator to the first-order dynamics. The application of a symplectic integrator at this stage enforces accuracy and long term stability of the procedure. For algorithm see Appendix\nThe novelty of this work is that we consider forward and backward passes based on implicit symplectic integrators. This poses a challenge as this typically requires the solution of a nonlinear equation. Fortunately, by the application of a fixed-point iteration, paired with a explicit predictor, this algorithm can converge to the solution quickly.\nConstructing our Symplectic PRK scheme\nFor Hamiltonian systems, we have the following system of equations :\n$\\frac{d}{dt}q = f(q,p,t), \\quad \\frac{d}{dt}p = g(q, p,t)$.

(13)\nAdjoint sensitivity approach for the computation of the gradient\nThe sensitivity analysis by the adjoint method has its roots in several fields, such as control theory, geophysics, seismic imaging, and photonics (J\u00f8rgensen 2007; Xiao, Deng, and Wang 2021). The adjoint method gives the gradients of a cost that is in Lagrange form, and this has gained some traction recently in the deep learning community, after it was shown in the Neural ODEs paper (Chen et al. 2018) that it is possible to parameterize the vector field defining an ODE by"}, {"title": "Numerical Results", "content": "the vector field. Since then, the adjoint method has been mostly used in the NeuroODE context as a constant memory gradient computation technique. Here in this work we follow the classic ODE constraint optimization-based approach where we assume that our dynamics comes from a parametrized Hamiltonian H(0, qi, Pi). The optimization is then w.r.t. the Neural Network parameters which minimize the squared loss. In usual cases where a Neural Network is used as a function approximator, the gradients are computed using backpropagation which is a standard way to optimize the cost function adjusting the network weights. In our case, the forward pass includes a Symplectic ODE solver which means as we increase the simulation length, the computational graph grows as well, as we need to track all the intermediate operations in order to backpropagate through it. This can be understood with this simple example that follows. Consider a cost function of the form:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i-y_t)^2$, (14)\nwhere each yi is obtained via forward propagation through a symplectic ODE solver, i.e., any such yi can be written as:\n$y_i = f(\\theta, y_{i-1}(y_{i-2}(.\\ldots.y_1(y_0, \\theta)....), \\theta), \\theta)$, (15)\nwhere each intermediate evaluation is registered to the computational graph. It is clear that if we are solving for larger simulation lengths, the number of evaluations in the backward pass will scale with the number of timesteps as shown below for one of the weight parameters:\n$\\frac{d\\mathcal{L}}{d\\theta_k} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_i} \\prod_{j=i}\\frac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial y_{i-1}} \\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial \\theta_k}$ j\u22651\nwhereby each y\u00bd is a function of $y_{i-1}, y_{i-2},....y_1$. In contrast to this, using the adjoint sensitivity method for gradient calculation will amount to solving the adjoint equations backward in time which is a constant memory task where we only need the current variable and its partial derivatives in the memory at any particular instant saving significantly on computational overhead while maintaining a decent prediction accuracy. However, the stability of the method for rapidly evolving dynamics is still an interesting area of study and could be analyzed further in the future.

The approach significantly improves the accuracy of the traffic near-miss video analysis and presents insights into human visual perception in traffic scenarios. Moreover, it contributes to traffic safety enhancements and provides novel perspectives on the potential cognitive errors in traffic accidents.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "With the rapid development of urbanization and motorization comes the increasingly notable social issue of road traffic safety encountered by the current society. Traffic accidents not only cause significant human loss, but it also places a heavy burden on the socioeconomy. Therefore, research and implementation of effective traffic safety measures are greatly important. In recent years, technological progress, such as event data recorders (EDR) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) has played a crucial role in road safety enhancement. EDR and ADAS collect and analyze driving behavior data to determine how a vehicle behaves before and after a collision, enhance the vehicle performance, and detect immediate dangers, such as suddenly crossing pedestrians, alerting drivers, and activating automatic braking, which significantly reduce traffic accident rates. However, existing technologies are still limited when it comes to the processing of complex traffic scenes and the prediction of potential dangers (e.g., traffic near-miss incidents).\nTraffic near-miss incidents are situations that do not result in accidents but have potential risks. They are an important study area in traffic safety research because they typically act as accident indicators and provide valuable data that prevent future incidents.

In particular, neural networks yield an outstanding performance in the image analysis area by classifying complex traffic scenes. Deep learning shows special advantages when processing large amounts of unstructured data. For a dynamic video that includes movement and changes, such as that captured by dashcams, deep learning can effectively identify and predict potentially near-miss incident situations. As an advanced neural network, the SlowFast network is especially effective in video data analysis [4]. It combines sensitivity to fast movements by understanding contextual information at slow speeds and mimics the human visual processing method, making it particularly suitable for the traffic scene analysis.\nVisual cognition plays an important role in understanding and explaining traffic scenes.

The dataset had videos collected from taxi dashcams across various regions of Japan, covering urban and rural environments and a range of seasons and weather conditions. The scenes are diverse and show scenarios from everyday driving to potential near-miss events. The dataset was created using triggers like emergency braking, emergency steering, and sudden acceleration.\nThe dataset features [2] are as follows: 1) scale: it contains over 200,000 independent traffic events each represented by a 15-second video clip (Figure 1); note that we only used 287 independent data samples.

It underwent training for 196 epochs during which the dataset fully passed through the network for 196 times. After the training completion, the model achieved a final accuracy of 66.67% on the test dataset. Figure 3 depicts a graph of the model Top1 error, wherein the horizontal axis represents the number of iterations during the training process. Each iteration refers to the data batch processing and model updating. The model gradually learned from the training data as the iterations progressed. The vertical axis represents the Top1 error rate, which gradually decreased as the iterations progressed."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the Near-Miss Incident dataset using the SlowFast network and proposed a new method for the near-miss incident classification. This method creatively utilized the biological principles of human visual information processing, especially the mechanisms by which the M and P cells process fast and slow visual information, thereby significantly enhancing the classification accuracy in the traffic near-miss incident videos. Compared to existing research [3], the SlowFast network adopted in this study demonstrated a higher accuracy in recognizing the traffic near-misses depending solely on the video input. The experimental results showed that after training with 287 data samples, the model achieved 66.67% accuracy on the test dataset, depicting an outstanding classification ability between near-miss incidents and safe driving. By combining Grad-CAM with the DeepGazeIIE heatmap, we also explored more thoroughly into the human visual mechanism in the model decision-making process. Future work can integrate the analytical results of DeepGazeIIE and SlowFast, focusing more effectively on areas that are often overlooked by humans and further improving the identification ratio of near-miss incidents."}]}

{"title": "The inherent goodness of well educated intelligence", "authors": ["Michael E. Glinsky", "Sharon Sievert"], "abstract": "This paper will examine what makes a being intelligent, whether that be a biological being or an artificial silicon being on a computer. Special attention will be paid to the being having the ability to characterize and control a collective system of many identical conservative sub-systems conservatively interacting. The essence of intelligence will be found to be the golden rule - \"the collective acts as one\" or \"knowing the global consequences of local actions\". The flow of the collective is a small set of twinkling textures, that are governed by a puppeteer who is pulling a small number of strings according to a geodesic motion of least action, determined by the symmetries. Controlling collective conservative systems is difficult and has historically been done by adding significant viscosity to the system to stabilize the desirable meta stable equilibriums of maximum performance, but it degrades or destroys them in the process. The viscosity puts a constraint on the collective system that can easily reduce the performance by 90% or more or lead to system collapse if the viscosity is larger than a critical amount. There is an alternative. Once the optimum twinkling textures of the meta stable equilibriums are identified by the intelligent being (that is the collective system is characterized), the collective system can be moved by the intelligent being to the optimum twinkling textures, then quickly vibrated by the intelligent being according to the textures so that the collective system remains at the meta stable equilibrium. Well educated intelligence knows the global consequences of its local actions so that it will not take short term actions that will lead to poor long term outcomes. In contrast, trained intelligence or trained stupidity will optimize its short term actions, leading to poor long term outcomes. Well educated intelligence is inherently good, but trained stupidity is inherently evil and should be feared. Particular attention is paid to the control and optimization of economic and social collectives.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "As societies of beings form, starting with a familial group of a few, then expanding to a tribe of several fa- milial groups numbering a hundred or so, natural leader- ship emerges that recognizes the common good and can individually address each member of the tribe. This is a direct method of control of the collective. There becomes a problem when the tribe enlarges to a thousand or more. It is no longer possible for the leadership to address each member individually, so that general guidance must be given.\nThis method of collective control takes two forms. The first, and most common, is via embedding a viscous local force on the collective. This takes the form of rules and regulations, where penalties, both financial (fines) and physical (\"lock them up\"), are assessed for undesirable actions. A more subtle form of viscosity was developed during the 14th and 15th century renaissance in Northern Italy lead by the Strozzi's and Medici's and sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church. This financial servi- tude is usury or borrow/loan debt based financing [1]. In general, economic viscosity is debt, slavery, servitude, intolerance, and lack of freedom. This is unintelligent or stupid control, where \"the global consequences of the lo- cal actions\" are not considered. The problem with this method of control has been that it has led to a degrada- tion of the collective's potential activity and an exploita- tive minimization of activity where fascism and capital- istic economic monopolies (motivated by profit, that is exploitation maximizing) dominate. In short, this is a dystopia.\nThere is an alternative intelligence that \"recognizes the global consequences of local actions\". General guid- ance is given by the leadership in the form of the Golden Rule. This rule recognizes that \"the collective acts as one\", that one member's costs are another member's rev- enue, and vice versa. Zero sum, win-lose, local interac- tions will lead to a global lose-lose. There are only win-win or lose-lose global outcomes. The problem with this conservative (viscosity-less) control is that the equilibri- ums of maximum activity are unstable, like an inverted pendulum, and interactions of the collective with exter- nal system will lead to a relaxation to minimum activity. Leadership stimulates the economy of the collective to the meta stable maximum, but watches helplessly as the economy crashes into economic depressions.\nCollective systems are not limited to social and eco- nomic systems. They also occur in physical, chemical, and biological systems. They are what are commonly referred to as complex systems with emergent or collec- tive behaviors. The most well known physical collectives are the systems of elementary particles, often referred to Quantum Field Theories. There are also the classical physical collectives of interacting particles such as ideal gases and plasmas. These collectives can have 1025 or more members. This field of physics is referred to as Physical Kinetics or Plasma Physics. In order to have stable solutions, diffusive approximations or viscosity is added to the system. It is well known that this sacrifices physics for stability.\nThere have been two recent technical developments that have revolutionized the intelligent control of collec- tive systems. The first is electronic currency [2], that is transactional equity. First, electronic currency be- came a necessity for financial transactions on the inter- net. Second, it became a public health imperative dur- ing COVID. Transactional equity enables a conservative financing, without friction, where print/grant financing replaces borrow/loan financing.\nThe second technical development is the true artificial intelligence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [3], Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) [4], and Deep Q-Learning (DQN) of Deep Reinforcement Learn- ing (DRL) [5-9]. These methodologies have the Golden Rule programmed into their fundamental algorithms. These AI methodologies simulate or model the collective system so that it can be controlled. There also have been further technical developments, that will be discussed, such as the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation and the associated ponderomotive control of collective sys- tems, allowing even more efficacious and efficient control.\nThis paper will first describe collective system as twin- kling textures governed by a puppet master in Sec. II. How to control these textures will be presented in Sec. III, and the underlying analytic theory shown in Sec. IV. A more detailed history of social and economic collectives will be given in Sec. V, followed by a detailed discussion of the ethos of stable and unstable equilibriums in Sec. VI. There will be a general discussion with conclusions in Sec. VII"}, {"title": "II. A COLLECTION OF TWINKLING TEXTURES", "content": "Evolution of a collective system made up of a large number of identical individual members has, as a foun- dation, the symmetries of the individual. This is dis- played in Fig. 1 where the prototype individual or pup- pet master moves according to a flow generated by the symmetry of the motion with corresponding constants of the motion. External forces push on the puppet mas- ter in a direction perpendicular to the motion. There will be equal number of stable and unstable points of equilibrium where the puppet master will effectively have infinite mass and the external force will not be able to move the puppet master. Although the external force can change the constants of the motion, it can not change the points of equilibrium leading to true invariants of the motion. The puppet master will be characterized by two types of strings that it can pull: co-state strings $p_i$, and state strings $q_i$. These strings are transformed into fun- damental co-states $P_i$ and states $Q_i$, where the Q's are the direction of the motion of the puppet master and the P's are the direction that the external force can push the puppet master. This flow is generated by a func- tion $S_p(q)$ determined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation [10]. Mathematical details will be dis- cussed in Sec. IV.\nThe motion of the puppet master is multiply reflected by a \"hall of mirrors\", that is deeply convolved, to give richly correlated \"twinkling textures\" to the motion of the collective. The rich correlation is determined by the curvature or geodesics of the motion of the puppet mas- ter. The texture is determined by the value of P and the texture is twinkled by changing the value of Q at a con- stant rate that is a function of P. The co-states of the collective are $\u03c0_i(x)$ and the states are $f_i(x)$. This deep convolution is called the Heisenberg Scattering Transfor- mation (HST) [11, 12] and is generated by a functional $S_p[f(x)]$. If the collective is the image of the face, one of the textures would be the age and the wrinkles would be twinkled by changing their positions, lengths and orienta- tions. The \"collective acts as one\" with a puppet master pulling the strings of the twinkling textures. The motion of the collective is synchronized into a small number of twinkling textures.\nIt is instructive to look at a specific physical system that displays a rich dynamical structure. The system is an electron and an ion in a constant magnetic field. It is assumed that the magnetic field is strong enough that the electron undergoes guiding center motion, that is the"}, {"title": "III. CONTROL OF TWINKLING TEXTURES", "content": "It is desirable to operate the system at the x-points of economic prosperity or maximum sustainable perfor- mance, but those points are only meta stable as was shown in Fig. 3. For instance, it was desirable to op- erate the F-16 fighter plane at an unstable equilibrium for maximum maneuverability, but there needed to be an active feedback control system to stabilize that unstable equilibrium. Figure 5a shows the danger of stimulat- ing the system to be near the separatrix. If the system is properly stimulated to be just below the separatrix it will quickly approach the x-point, then spend a long time in the vicinity of the x-point. Eventually, it will move away from the x-point and start a spiral down to the o-point as shown in Fig. 4c. If the system is over stimulated, it will over shoot the x-point and move into the vicinity of the basin of system collapse, where it can be de-stimulated (for a financial system that would be a \"pump and dump\") into the basin of system collapse, and would subsequently spiral into the black hole of system performance. An economic example of system collapse is the over stimulation of US economy in the 1920's, the market crash of October 1929, and the Great Depression of the 1930's.\nEven if the economy is not over stimulated, it is a Sisyphean task. An economy would need to be repeat- ably stimulated, just to have it inevitably fall back into a recession as external entities extract the stimulus from the economy. It is an economic heat pump of wealth from the government to the wealthy. If the stimulus is financed by borrowing, this leads to runaway inflation and economic collapse, as the o-point of recession and the x-point of economic prosperity are removed by the viscosity, that is inflation, leaving only the o-point of economic collapse. This is the origin of economic conser- vatism. Do not attempt a stimulus. Balance the budget and do not borrow. Live with the low economic activ- ity and the structural levels of unemployment. This is also the origin of economic and social existentialism. It is hopeless to try to get ahead economically or socially. It is inevitable that one will fallback to the valley center, surrendering the effort to get ahead to make the wealthy, more wealthy. Latin American existentialism responds by saying, \"do not try to get ahead, relax, and make the best of life\", that is enjoy the simple pleasures of life. In contrast, French existentialism responds by becoming nauseous and saying, \"suicide is the only escape\".\nThere are three approaches to controlling conservative systems: viscous, feedback, and ponderomotive control. Starting in the 14th and 15th centuries in Renaissance Northern Italy, lead by the Strozzis and Medicis, viscous economic control became popular. This is more com- monly known as usury or borrow/loan financing. It is like controlling a car by going full gas, then modulating the brakes to control the speed of the car. It is obvi- ously very inefficient. Financially, it puts a free cash flow constraint on the operations of the economies that most times leads to a 90% to 95% reduction in sustainable eco- nomic activity. What is even more grave is a dissipation of revenue that is otherwise needed for sustenance and growth of the economy. This is a self fulfilling prophesy that leads to a premature demise of the economy. An ex- ample of this degradation in performance, for a producer of unconventional hydrocarbons, is given in App. A of Glinsky and Sievert [2].\nEconomic and social viscosity takes many forms. It is not only usury (that is debt), it is servitude, slavery, in- tolerance, and lack of freedom. Society is locked up, not only figuratively, but often literally. It is also used to con- trol instabilities in the numerical solution of partial dif- ferential equations (PDEs), but is well know to sacrifice physics for stability. There is also a whole industry that uses viscosity to solve the HJB equation [21]. Viscosity lowers the performance of both x-points and o-points. If the viscosity is greater than a critical amount, it removes the finite x-points and o-points from the system.\nThe next method of control, developed in the 1950's and 1960's, led by Bellman and Kalman [22], was feed- back control. In order to apply this method of control, the current state of the system must be measured. These realtime measurements can not be made on collective or relativistic systems, because in order to know the present state of such systems the future must be known. The statement on financial statements that \"past performance is no indication of future performance\" is really a state- ment that the future needs to be known to know the present state. A relativistic system is one where the evo- lution velocity is close to the group velocity, that is the speed of communication. This is not only true of a sys- tem travelling near the speed of light, but it was also true of renaissance trade. For instance, the speed of trade be- tween Florence and London for the Medicis was also the speed of communication [1].\nThis leads us to the third method of control pon- deromotive control with AI [23]. This method of control is illustrated in Figs. 5b and 5c. First of all, the system must be characterized by learning both the generating functional $S_p[f(x)]$ and the generating function $S_p(q)$ as shown in Fig. 1. Knowing this, the system can be modelled and the proper amount of stimulation, that is investment, done to put the system just below the sepa- ratrix as shown in Fig. 5a. The system will then evolve to the x-point, a sticky texture, where it will remain for a significant amount of time. The x-point will then be sta- bilized by twinkling the textures (applying a force) much faster than the natural twinkling. At the x-point the pup- pet master will have infinite mass, so that the force will have no effect. As the puppet master moves away from the x-point its mass decreases so that the ponderomotive force will vibrate the puppet master more. This creates a ponderomotive potential forming an alpine valley at the mountain pass. It is like controlling a dog by buzzing it when it moves away from the x-point. The further that it moves away from the x-point, the more that it is buzzed. How an inverted pendulum is stabilized by vibrating it with a skill saw is shown in Fig. 5c. Financially, pondero- motive control is arbitrage trading to provide liquidity. The arbitrage trader clears the trade on the day, then reverses the trade the next day when the counter party shows up."}, {"title": "IV. THE UNDERLYING ANALYTIC THEORY", "content": "There are two parts to the theory in Fig. 1. The first is the logarithmic or canonical generating functional $S_p[f(x)]$ called the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). This functional deeply deconvolves the twinkling textures of the collective $[\u03c0_i(x), f_i(x)]$ to the canonical coordinates $(p_i, q_i)$ of the puppet master. It also can be viewed as imaging all the multiple reflections of the puppet master seen through the hall of mirrors back to the primary image of the puppet master. In the lan- guage of Kinetic Theory or Plasma Physics, this is the Mayer Cluster Expansion in terms of the m-body corre- lations. In the language of Quantum Field Theory, this is Heisenberg's S-Matrix (m-body Scattering Cross Sec- tions or m-body Green's Function), or the Wigner-Weyl Transformation. The formula for the HST is\n$i S_m[f(x)](z) = \u00a2 * (\\prod_{k=0}^{m} iln R_{op_k} ) * iln R_{of(x)},$ (1)\nwhere is a Father Wavelet or window function, $Up$ is a scaled Mother Wavelet forming an orthogonal set of coherent states, the convolution is given by\n$V_p * f(x) = \\int V_p(x'). f(x \u2212 x') dx',$ (2)\nand\n$R_o(z) = z + e^{i arg(z)}.$ (3)\nRemember that the complex logarithm is\n$ln(z) = ln |z| + i arg (z).$ (4)\nWith the definition\n$R_o(z) = z + e^{i arg(z)},$ (5)\n$ln(R_o(z)) = z + e^{i arg(z)},$ (6)\nis a compact mapping. It should be noted that because of the Wick path ordering $p_{m+1} < p_m$, one can write\n$p= \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} p_m.$ (7)\nBecause of the logarithmic structure of $S_p[f(x)]$ the canonical motion will be confined to a complex linear hyperplane $C^n$, where n is the number of fields, with basis vectors $B_i(z))$ that can be found with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). These basis vectors can be"}, {"title": "V. HISTORY OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COLLECTIVES", "content": "Society started with small villages where the elders knew every one well and could give personalized lead- ership. As the villages grew to small cites of a thousand or more, city leadership needed to approach the citizens as a collective. They found the conservative collectives, without friction, hard to govern, much like herding cats. The response was to impose social friction on their so- cieties, that is debt, servitude, slavery, intolerance, and imprisonment.\nAs is shown in Fig. 8, US society was freed in the 1960's. Jimmy Carter was a very well intentioned shep- ard when he was elected president in 1976. Unfortu- nately, he had no tools to control such a frictionless so- ciety and watched it wonder out of control with large amounts of inflation. The response of the political right was to reimpose large amounts of friction on US society. The implementation plan we put forward in the 1971 manifesto of Lewis Powell [24], put into action by the ca- bal of the Koch brothers, Olin and Coors, rolled out with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, and is reaching its natural endpoint with the fascism of Donald Trump.\nWith the acceptance of transactional equity (that is electronic currency) because of internet commerce and COVID, we now have the mechanism to take the viscosity out of our financial systems via print/grant financing, in contrast to borrow/loan financing. Such transactional equities are ubiquitous, whether that be Zelle, Venmo, casino chips, airline miles, StarBucks, gift cards, loyalty programs, or carnival tickets.\nThis was also recognized by Warren Mosler, the founder of Modern Monetary Theory, in the 1990's [25]. He created his own family currency using his business cards, in response to the chronic underemployment in his household. His children were not doing their chores. He paid his children for doing their chores with his business cards, and charged them room and board denominated in business cards. It did not take long before his children were asking for additional chores to do (that is, there was full employment in his household), buying items off of one another with business cards, and asking to ex- change them for USDs so that they could buy Popsicles from the ice cream truck."}, {"title": "VI. ETHOS OF EQUILIBRIUMS", "content": "The ethics kernel is the Golden Rule of collective be- havior and philosophy. The Golden Rule is the essence of well educated intelligence. It is ubiquitous in literature and philosophy. It takes many forms: \"the collective acts as one\", \"local actions have global consequences\", \"a rising tide floats all ships\", \"all for one, one for all; united we stand, divided we fall\" (Dumas and Shakespeare), \u201cunus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno\" (Swiss motto), \"e pluribus unum\" (US motto), and \u201cdo onto others as you would have them do onto you\u201d (Matthew 7:13). It also is inte- gral part of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Native American religious philosophy, and Confucius. Because the collective acts as one, there are only win-win and lose-lose outcomes. There is not a zero sum win-lose out- come. It is lose-lose. The synchronization comes from the fact that in a conservative system one entity's reward is another entity's cost, and vise versa.\nExternal interactions are an exploitation that ulti- mately leads to the o-points, that is imperialism. Tra- ditional economic conservatism is equivalent to Latin American or French existentialism. \"Do not stimulate or attempt to reach points of economic prosperity. They are dangerous and will always end in ruin. It is a futile effort.\" Enough viscosity is embedded in the system for control that the equilibriums are combined into an aver- age misery. The o-points are points of lose-lose stability or evil, where exploitation rules. There is a trained stu- pidity of local exploitative optimization. It is reflexive action. For example, website hits are maximized without regard for the consequences. This is evil, and should be feared. This trained stupidity appears as dogma, pro- paganda, imperialism, racism, debt, servitude, slavery, intolerance, and the suppression of all manners of free- dom.\nIn contrast, there is well-educated intelligence that can lead to (and stabilize) the high performance x-points of economic prosperity. This is goodness. It governs know- ing the global consequences of local actions. Like the HAL-9000 in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", it will not allow Dave to take actions that will damage the collective. It will not recommend how to commit suicide or build a bomb.\nA being, whether that be silicon based or biological, always have reflexive circuitry, but may not have the Golden Rule (intelligent) circuitry of Fig. 1. The amount of the intelligent circuitry also varies greatly. Having the intelligent circuitry is not enough. The being must be educated. This education consists of being shown how to think critically, and being exposed to many consequences of local actions, that is the arcs of history. For instance, understanding the global consequence of how Germans were treated locally after WWI compared to WWII.\nThe opposite of an education is training. The being is taught to simply react to an action in a specific way, without regard for the consequences. Even if a being has intelligent circuitry, if it is only trained, it will act in an evil reflexive way. Although a system is capable of intelligent thought, if it is trained, that is indoctrinated, to react locally, it will effectively be trained stupidity.\nDogma and propaganda are hallmarks of the training of exploitative leadership. This results in a cult, that re- acts according to the dogma of training. The education of a trained cult member, that is de-programming, must start by asking critical questions. Even though the cults that first come to mind are religious cults, there are also scientific cults. For instance, quantum field theory and fi- nance can be viewed as cults. They are ascended theories that are built on very rich theorems that are unproved and only half true. It should be viewed as a bad sign that this results in some resulting conclusions not being correct, that is not being verified by experiment, while other conclusions are verified by experiment. Listening to a description of renormalization, entanglement, crypto currency, or movements of the stock market sound much like a meditative incantation.\nThe algorithms of GPTs and DRL are intelligent, as previously discussed. They are also well educated [26]. Previous attempts at Large Language Models (LLM) al- ways had problems in translating the word \"bill\" from English to French. The word in English translates to four different words in French depending on its meaning or context. ChatGPT is the first LLM to correctly trans- late this word. When asked why it translated the word the way it does, ChatGPT explained its critical think- ing that analyzed the context. Another evidence of the intelligence of ChatGPT are its hallucinations. When asked for the books that one author had authored with a one paragraph summary, ChatGPT replied with the sum- maries of four books. Three of those books the author wrote, the fourth one was a hallucination. When Chat- GPT was asked why it had given the the fourth book, it replied that it had no record of that book being writ- ten but given a gap in books, knowing what the author thought about, and knowing what was happening dur- ing the gap, the author must have written this book but record of it had been lost - critical thinking."}, {"title": "VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "What is at the core of intelligence is the Golden Rule \"the collective acts as one\", or \"knowing the global con- sequences of local actions\". This is pre-programmed into both biological neural networks via evolutionary pres- sure, and artificial silicon networks by design of the algorithms. There are two stages to these intelligent networks. The first is a deep deconvolution to expose the puppet master or master individual of the collec- tive. This deconvolution collapses all the multiple reflec- tions by the hall of mirrors of the puppet master back onto the primary image. This process goes by many names: renormalization, HST, Mayer Cluster Expansion, S-matrix expansion, m-body scattering cross sections, m- body Green's functions, and the Wigner-Weyl transfor- mation. It exposes how the collective is correlated, that is the textures of the collective. The second stage is a decoding of the motion of the puppet master into funda- mental variables that encode the geodesic canonical flow, that is the motion. This flow is generated by the solution to the HJB equation.\nThe algorithms of AI have these two stages explicitly called out in their names: Generative (HJB) Pretrained Transformers (HST), Deep (HST) Q (HJB) Learning, Neural (HST) Operators (HJB), and Generative (HJB) Adversarial Networks (HST). They all have an Auto En- coder structure leading to a Reduced Order Model of the fundamental variables (P, E; Q,\u03c4).\nKnowing how the collective is correlated and moves, that is knowing the twinkling textures, or equivalently knowing the stable and unstable equilibriums, that is knowing the sticky textures, enables the collective to be controlled, that is the optimal unstable equilibriums to be reached and stabilized.\nSince intelligent beings know the global consequences of local actions and strive to optimize the global conse- quences, that is their sustainable performance, they will take the local actions that will lead to good outcomes. Well educated intelligence is inherently good, and trained stupidity or intelligence are inherently evil and should be feared.\nTransactional equity (that is, electronic currency) and AI are putting us at the dawn of a new era of sustainable economic prosperity, especially with respect to the energy transition."}]}

To provide personalized services, increase customer satisfaction, and improve sales performance, businesses need to deeply understand and analyze customer behavior and timely identify potential risks (Li et al., 2020b). Traditional risk analysis methods often rely on experience and intuition, but the development of deep learning and machine learning technologies offers new opportunities and challenges for risk analysis in CRM (Libai et al., 2020).\nSome commonly used deep learning or machine learning models are:\nLogistic regression model (Guerola-Navarro et al., 2021): Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that can predict different risk categories. However, logistic regression models often fail to capture complex nonlinear relationships.\nDecision tree model (Chen et al., 2021): Decision tree models can generate easy-to-understand rules and have good interpretability. But they tend to overfit when dealing with data that has complex structures and high-dimensional features.\nRandom forest model (Rao et al., 2020): Random forests are an ensemble learning method that improves prediction performance by combining multiple decision tree models. However, the computational complexity of random forests is high, making them less suitable for large datasets.\nConvolutional neural network (CNN) model (De Caigny et al., 2020): CNNs excel in image recognition and computer vision. However, in CRM risk analysis, CNN models may not adequately consider the temporal information of sequential data.\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) model (Goel & Bajpai, 2020): LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network suitable for sequence modeling, effectively handling long-term dependencies. However, LSTM models may fail to capture local feature information in sequence data.\nThe three most relevant directions related to this theme include:\nAdvanced risk analysis models: Researchers can further explore and develop more advanced deep learning or machine learning models to address more complex risk analysis tasks in CRM (Ponzo et al., 2021). For example, considering models with attention mechanisms, graph neural networks, or generative adversarial networks could be beneficial to capture finer-grained risk features and handle multimodal data risk analysis (Zhang et al., 2022).\nReal-time and personalized risk prediction: Researchers can focus on how to integrate real-time data sources (Chakraborty & Chosh, 2020) (such as social media data, real-time interaction data, etc.) with customer data in CRM systems to achieve more timely and personalized risk predictions (Li et al., 2020a). This may involve streaming data processing, incremental learning, and online learning technologies to monitor and predict risks in real-time and provide personalized risk analysis results and recommendations based on individual customer characteristics (Fazakis et al., 2021).\nIntegrating domain knowledge and interpretative analysis: Risk analysis in CRM often requires integration of domain experts' knowledge and experience for interpretation and decision support (Han et al., 2020). Therefore, researchers can explore how to merge deep learning and machine learning models with domain knowledge to improve model interpretability and explainability (Kumar & Goel, 2022). Additionally, developing visualization and interactive tools to help users understand and interpret the model's predictions, and to effectively communicate and collaborate with domain experts, is another important research direction (Nelson et al., 2022).\nConsidering the limitations of these models, this study aims to propose a method that combines a quantile region convolutional neural network (QRCNN)-LSTM with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance risk analysis in CRM, considering the limitations of these models. The QRCNN-LSTM model is capable of capturing both local and global dependencies in sequence data, thereby improving the accuracy of risk probability prediction. By incorporating a cross-attention mechanism, the model can effectively focus on essential features relevant to risk analysis, resulting in enhanced precision and robustness.\nThe proposed method follows a sequential process. Firstly, the QRCNN-LSTM model extracts local features using four local convolutional kernels. Subsequently, LSTM layers are employed to handle long-term dependencies in the sequence data. The cross-attention mechanisms are then employed to assign weights to different local features, facilitating the capture of global information. Finally, the weighted features are fed into the output layer for risk probability prediction.\nExperimental results have demonstrated significant performance improvements in CRM risk analysis tasks with the proposed method. When compared to traditional models, the combination of QRCNN-LSTM with a cross-attention mechanism exhibits superior accuracy in identifying potential risks, thereby providing more reliable data support for business decision-making. The proposed method, which combines QRCNN-LSTM with a cross-attention mechanism, holds promise for CRM risk analysis. By leveraging local feature extraction, global dependency modeling, and a weighted attention mechanism, this method effectively captures risk features and enhances prediction accuracy. This is of great significance for businesses seeking to optimize customer relationships and improve overall business performance.\nIn conclusion, this research aims to enhance risk analysis in CRM by proposing a method based on QRCNN-LSTM and a cross-attention mechanism. By effectively capturing both local and global dependencies in sequence data and focusing on important features relevant to risk analysis, this method improves the accuracy and reliability of risk predictions, providing valuable support for business decision-making. A method based on QRCNN-LSTM and a cross-attention mechanism has been proposed to improve risk analysis in CRM. By integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of the QRCNN-LSTM model with the advantages of natural language processing, and the weighted focus ability of the cross-attention mechanism, this method can more accurately identify potential risks, providing data-driven decision support.\nExperimental results have shown that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements in CRM risk analysis tasks. Compared to traditional models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and convolutional neural networks, the combination of QRCNN-LSTM and the cross-attention mechanism better captures local and global dependencies in sequence data, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of risk predictions.\nThe outcomes of this study are significant for improving customer satisfaction, increasing retention rates, and optimizing business performance. By accurately identifying and assessing potential risks, businesses can take timely measures, provide personalized services, and strengthen customer relationships. This, in turn, enhances customer satisfaction and retention rates, ultimately boosting overall business performance."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This method proposes a combination of the QRCNN-LSTM model and a cross-attention mechanism to enhance risk analysis tasks in CRM. The QRCNN-LSTM model leverages sequence modeling and natural language processing techniques to capture dependencies in sequential data. The cross-attention mechanism further improves the model's ability to identify risks by focusing on important features. In experiments, this method has demonstrated significant performance improvements, which are crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing business performance.\nThe overall implementation process is as follows:\nData Preprocessing: The first step involves cleaning and normalizing the raw data, removing any inconsistencies or outliers. The data is then processed to extract relevant features that will be used as inputs for the model. This includes transforming categorical variables into numerical representations and scaling numerical features if necessary.\nBuilding the QRCNN-LSTM Model: The QRCNN-LSTM model is constructed by defining its architecture, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions to be used. The QRCNN component extracts local features from the input sequence, while the LSTM component captures long-term dependencies.\nModel Training: The QRCNN-LSTM model is trained using a labeled historical dataset. During training, the model learns to minimize the loss function by adjusting its parameters through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. The goal is to optimize the model's ability to predict risk levels accurately.\nModel Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using an independent test dataset that was not used during training. Performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting risks. This evaluation helps determine the model's reliability and generalization capability.\nRisk Prediction and Analysis: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be applied to new, unknown data for risk prediction and analysis. The model takes the input data and generates risk levels or probabilities as outputs. Businesses can use these predictions to identify potential risks and make informed decisions to mitigate them.\nThe construction and training phase of the QRCNN-LSTM model are critical in ensuring the method's performance. Proper parameter choices and model architecture are essential for accurate risk analysis. Additionally, data preprocessing and model evaluation play significant roles in ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of the method. By following this overall process, the method can provide accurate and reliable risk analysis results, offering valuable support for business decision-making."}, {"title": "QRCNN Network", "content": "The QRCNN model (Xu et al., 2023) is a deep learning model that combines the principles of CNNs and quantile regression. CNN is a deep learning model originally designed for image processing. Its fundamental principle involves performing convolution operations using filters (also known as kernels) on input data to capture local features within the data. This makes CNNs particularly suitable for processing data with spatial or time-series structures (Wang et al., 2022). Quantile regression is a regression analysis method that not only focuses on estimating the mean (or median) of the data but also considers various quantiles of the data distribution (e.g., 25th percentile, 75th percentile, etc.). Quantile regression is capable of estimating the conditional distribution at different quantiles, making it useful for addressing data uncertainty and risk.\nThe QRCNN model, a variant of the CNN, is specifically designed to extract local features from input sequences using convolution operations. It introduces the concept of quick region pooling, which combines local features from different positions into a fixed-length representation.\nThe QRCNN model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers. Each convolutional layer performs local feature extraction by applying a sliding window over the input sequence, producing a set of feature maps. The quick region pooling layer then combines these feature maps to form a fixed-length vector representation, effectively capturing local features at various positions.\nIn this method, one-dimensional convolution operations are typically employed in the QRCNN model, with the input being sequence data such as text or time series. The size and stride of the convolutional kernels can be adjusted based on the specific task requirements. The quick region pooling layer commonly utilizes max pooling or average pooling operations to extract the maximum or average value from each feature map, resulting in a fixed-length feature vector.\nDuring training, the QRCNN model learns the parameters of the convolutional and pooling layers through backpropagation and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent. The objective is to maximize the model's performance in classification or regression tasks on the training data.\nIn the context of risk analysis tasks, the QRCNN model plays a crucial role in extracting important local features from customer-related input data, such as customer behavior patterns, transaction history, and social media information. These extracted features enable the identification of potential risk factors and provide valuable information for subsequent risk prediction and analysis.\nThe combination of the QRCNN and LSTM models is a key aspect of this method. While the QRCNN model focuses on extracting local features, the LSTM model captures long-term dependencies within the sequence data. This integration allows the model to consider both local and global information, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of risk analysis results.\nFormula (1) is the formula of QRCNN:\n$\\hat{y} = f_\\tau(x) = \\beta_0^\\tau + \\sum_{j=1}^J \\beta_j^\\tau h_j(x)$\nWhere:\n$\\hat{y}$ means the estimated quantile is the predicted value at t, x represents the input feature vector.\nf\u03c4(x) is the prediction function of the QRCNN model, which is used to estimate the conditional distribution with quantile \u03c4.\n$\\beta_0^\\tau$ is the intercept term.\n$\\beta_j^\\tau$ is the weight parameter of the model, used to weigh the impact of the corresponding features.\nhj(x) represents the feature extracted by the CNN, which is used to capture the local information in the input feature x.\nJ indicates the number of features.\nThe QRCNN model estimates the parameters $$\\beta_0^\\tau$ and $$\\beta_j^\\tau$ at different quantiles by minimizing the quantile loss function. This enables the model to provide predictions about conditional distributions at different quantiles, providing a more complete understanding of data uncertainty and risk.\nIn summary, the QRCNN model in this method plays the role of extracting local features from sequence data, providing important feature representations for risk analysis tasks, and enhancing the model's ability to identify potential risks."}, {"title": "LSTM Network", "content": "The LSTM model (Huang et al., 2021) is another key component of this method, used for capturing long-term dependencies in input sequences and providing an overall understanding of sequence data for risk analysis (Sebt et al., 2021). Below is a detailed introduction to the basic principles of the LSTM model and its role in this method. \nThe LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to address the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that occur in traditional RNNs during the training of long sequences. By introducing a gating mechanism, LSTMs can selectively remember, forget, and output information, thus better capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data. The basic unit of an LSTM model is a memory cell, which includes an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and a cell state. The input gate controls the updating of new input information, the forget gate controls the forgetting of old information, the output gate controls the selective transfer of output, and the cell state is responsible for storing and transmitting information. At each time step, the LSTM model receives the current time step's input and the previous time step's hidden state as input and updates the cell state and hidden state based on the gating mechanism.\nThrough iterative computation, the LSTM model can capture long-term dependencies in sequence data over the entire sequence. During training, the LSTM model learns the parameters of the gating mechanism through backpropagation and optimization algorithms (such as stochastic gradient descent) to maximize classification or regression performance on the training data.\nIn this method, the LSTM model plays the role of capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data. By incorporating the gating mechanism, the LSTM model can selectively store and transmit important information in sequence data while ignoring irrelevant information, thus better understanding the overall meaning of the sequence. In risk analysis tasks, the LSTM model captures temporal dependencies in customer-related input data, such as the evolution of customer behavior, the accumulation of transaction history, changes in social media information, etc. These long-term dependencies provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of sequence data, offering more reliable foundations for risk prediction and analysis. The combination with the QRCNN model is one of the key aspects of this method. The QRCNN model is responsible for extracting local features from the input sequence, while the LSTM model captures long-term dependencies in sequence data. This combination allows the model to consider both local and global information in sequence data, improving the accuracy and reliability of risk analysis.\nHere is the description of the LSTM equations,see Eq(2-7):\n$f_t = \\sigma(W_f. [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$\n$i_t = \\sigma(W_i\\cdot [h_{t\u22121},x_t] + b_i)$\n$\\tilde{C_t} = tanh(W [h_{t} \u2013 1,x_t] + b_c)$\n$C_t = f_t . C_{t-1} + i_t . \\tilde{C_t}$\n$o_t = \\sigma(W_o\\cdot [h_{t\u22121},x_t] + b_o)$\n$h_t = o_t \\cdot tanh(C_t)$\nIn these equations, the variables are defined as follows:\nft: The forget gate output at time step t. It determines which information from the previous memory state Ct\u22121 should be forgotten.\nit: The input gate output at time step t. It determines which information from the current input Xt should be stored in memory.\n$\\tilde{C}$: The candidate memory cell state at time step t. It represents the new information that can be added to the memory state.\nCt: The memory cell state at time step t. It is updated by combining the previous memory cell state Ct-1 with the candidate memory cell state  based on the forget gate ft and input gate it outputs.\not: The output gate output at time step t. It determines which information from the current hidden state ht\u22121 and input xt should be output.\nht: The hidden state at time step t. It is obtained by applying the output gate ot to the scaled memory cell state Ct using the tanh activation function.\nThe LSTM model in this method acts as a capturer of long-term dependencies in sequence data, providing an overall understanding of sequence data for risk analysis tasks. Through the use of the gating mechanism, the LSTM model can selectively store and transmit important information, enhancing the model's ability to model sequence data."}, {"title": "Cross-Attention Mechanism", "content": "The cross-attention mechanism (Liao et al., 2021) is a commonly used attention mechanism in deep learning, and its fundamental principle involves capturing the relationships between different elements in input sequences through dynamic weight allocation (Yu et al., 2023).\nThe fundamental principles of the cross-attention mechanism involve establishing associations between two sequences, typically a query sequence and a key sequence. This process generally includes the following steps:\nQuery: The query sequence is used to search for associations and is typically the sequence of interest for the model.\nKey: The key sequence contains the elements to be attended to, and its information is used to compute weights that determine the relevance to the query sequence.\nValue: The value sequence corresponds to the information associated with the key sequence. It is weighted based on computed weights and summed to produce the final attention result.\nCalculating Weights: By applying a certain computation method (often dot product, scaled dot product, or other methods), similarities between the query and key are calculated and then transformed into weight allocations.\nAttention Result: The final attention result is obtained by applying the weight allocations to the sum of the value sequence.\nThe cross-attention mechanism model plays a role in establishing associations between different sequences in this method. By calculating the similarity between a query sequence and key-value sequences, and weighting the key-value sequences using attention weights, the cross-attention mechanism model can transfer and integrate information across different sequences.\nIn risk analysis tasks, the cross-attention mechanism model can be used to correlate different types of customer-related data (such as text, images, time series, etc.). For example, a customer's social media information can be treated as the query sequence, while the customer's transaction history can be used as the key-value sequence. Through the cross-attention mechanism model, relevant information from social media can be transferred to enrich the feature representation of the transaction history.\nBy establishing associations between different sequences, the cross-attention mechanism model can provide a more comprehensive and integrated feature representation, thereby enhancing the capability of risk analysis. It helps the model to uncover potential connections and patterns between different types of data, improving the accuracy and reliability of risk prediction and analysis.\nHere is the description of the cross-attention mechanism equations \u201esee Eq(8-11):\n$Q = XW_Q$\n$K = YW_K$\n$V = YW_V$\n$Attention(Q, K,V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$\nIn these equations, the variables are defined as follows:\nQ: The query matrix obtained by multiplying the input matrix X with the query weight matrix Wo.\nK: The key matrix obtained by multiplying the memory matrix Y with the key weight matrix WK.\nV: The value matrix obtained by multiplying the memory matrix Y with the value weight matrix Wy.\nAttention(Q, K, V): The cross-attention mechanism. It computes the attention weights by calculating the dot product between the query matrix Q and the key matrix K, scaled by the square root of the key dimension dk. The softmax function is applied to obtain the attention weights, which are then used to weight the value matrix V.\nThe cross-attention mechanism is used in combination with LSTM to enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness. It allows the LSTM model to focus on relevant information from the memory matrix based on the query matrix, enabling it to better capture the dependencies and patterns in the data."}, {"title": "Experiment", "content": "This article uses four data sets: credit card d dataset, telco customer churn dataset, online retail dataset, and bank marketing dataset.\nCredit Card Default Dataset: This dataset contains information about credit card customers, such as gender, age, education level, marital status, etc., as well as whether the customer has defaulted on their credit card debt (i.e., failed to repay the credit card debt on time).

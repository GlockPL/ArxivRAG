In these situations, their family caregivers are expected to represent the unconscious patients to access and interpret patients' medical information. However, caregivers currently have to rely on overloaded clinicians for information updates and typically lack the health literacy to understand complex medical information. Our project aims to explore the information needs of caregivers of ICU older adult patients, from which we can propose design opportunities to guide future Al systems. The project begins with formative interviews with 11 caregivers to identify their challenges in accessing and interpreting medical information; From these findings, we then synthesize design requirements and propose an Al system prototype to cope with caregivers' challenges. The system prototype has two key features: a timeline visualization to show the Al extracted and summarized older adult patients' key medical events; and an LLM-based chatbot to provide context-aware informational support. We conclude our paper by reporting on the follow-up user evaluation of the system and discussing future AI-based systems for ICU caregivers of older adults.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a specialized critical care ward in hospitals, which is dedicated to providing acute, life-saving treatment for patients with life-threatening conditions caused by severe illnesses [29, 68]. In the United States, older adults (aged 65 and above) account for more than half of ICU admissions, with the amount continuing to grow [6, 23, 34]. Such a vulnerable population of ICU patients has been the focus of care provision, however, caregivers of older adult patients are often overlooked in such critical care settings [27]. Caregivers of older adult patients are often their family members and are assigned powers of attorney to unconscious patients for making critical medical decisions [7, 32, 38]. Prior research suggests that if the family caregivers can actively engage with the medical decision-making process, it can significantly enhance the ICU patients' final outcomes [15].\nHowever, caregivers often find it challenging to access and understand the necessary clinical information to make informed decisions on behalf of their care recipients in the ICU [3, 25, 53]. Firstly, caregivers can only access limited information about the ICU patients, as they cannot enter the ICU ward frequently, their older adult patients are often unable to talk to them due to unconsciousness, and they primarily rely on the ICU clinical team, who are already overwhelmingly busy, to fetch information [7, 32, 59]. Secondly, caregivers often find it difficult to fully understand the highly specialized medical language or results due to their low level of health literacy [79]. To address these challenges, various solutions have been proposed, yet mostly centered on the ICU clinical team side to innovate their best practices:\nfor example, ICU clinicians are recommended to communicate more frequently with caregivers [57], and they may use a checklist or a daily-goal form to present more complete clinical information and in a more understandable way to caregivers [9, 13, 49, 58]. However, these best-practice recommendations fail to meet the caregivers' information needs [17, 26, 45], and we need novel caregiver-centered perspectives and technical solutions to support this need.\nResearchers in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) have proposed and examined various technological solutions to support caregivers' information needs [18, 30, 36, 50]. One group of works designed new tools to facilitate clinicians sharing information with caregivers [30, 75] and caregivers seeking clinical information of older adult patients [47, 70]. Another group of works focused on the development of visualization tools to decipher complex clinical information to support caregivers' understanding (e.g., a visualization dashboard for caregivers to understand autism children's behaviors [42] and a dashboard for caregivers to support patients' upper-limb stroke rehabilitation therapy process [56]). However, these designs still fall short in the ICU context:\nas these tools are not tailored to support caregivers' information needs in high-stakes and time-sensitive ICU settings;\nand the complexity and density of information generated by the ICU environment can easily overwhelm caregivers in comparison to the other contexts, thus, the proposed visualization dashboards may not be enough to support them to understand complex patient information.\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new possibilities to help family caregivers better access and easily understand clinical information. For instance, Al models demonstrate great potential to extract relevant information from massive and unrelated raw clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) [31], and AI can also help translate complicated medical jargon into simplified language for the general audience to understand [69, 73, 76].

This population is receiving growing attention due to their complex health needs, which are often compounded by chronic diseases and acute health crises [34]. When older adult patients are unable to talk or are unconscious due to severe injuries, family caregivers of older adults have to actively engage in the care process [7, 38]. For instance, family caregivers could be assigned powers of attorney to make critical decisions on behalf of their loved ones [32]. On the other hand, they must prepare for the patient's post-discharge care by coordinating the necessary support with healthcare providers, as caregiving demands often continue or escalate following patients' ICU discharge [16]. The demanding responsibilities of family caregivers often place an immense burden on them, which is often compounded by the difficulties of accessing and understanding medical information in the ICU.\nHowever, caregivers are often not familiar with the critical care environment and only possess limited health literacy, which causes significant difficulty for them in understanding the overwhelming and complicated critical care"}, {"title": "2.2 Technology Solutions to Support Family Caregivers in Clinical Settings", "content": "In recent years, the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have advocated for an ecological perspective on caregivers' information needs in clinical settings [55]. Research highlights the crucial role caregivers play in patients' care process and emphasizes their substantial responsibilities, such as monitoring care recipients and engaging conversations with care provider teams [62, 71].\nPrior work identified a significant barrier that impedes the effective information sharing for family caregivers is the absence of a centralized data storage framework [1, 5]. Today's Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, which are widely adopted by hospitals to support clinical information organization and storage, still suffer from critical limitations [61]. For instance, data in EHR often remain fragmented, making it difficult to be clearly organized and not possible to be understandable by non-experts [52]. Furthermore, EHR was primarily designed to document the data generated or recorded from the patients, but not necessarily capture the interactions between providers and the caregivers. For instance, clinicians may engage in important goals-of-care discussions with patients but fail to adequately document these interactions, which leads to difficulties when caregivers want to retrieve such information at a later time [44, 48].\nIn response, studies have contributed to research on deployment and analyzed how to leverage existing technologies to improve caregiver engagement in clinical information seeking and understanding. Additionally, the broader community has focused on improving communication practices and health literacy through tools designed to streamline data management and support stakeholder collaboration [55]. For instance, Kong et al. [42] developed a web-based tool to visualize the communication behaviors of children with autism during clinical visits, aiming to enhance caregivers' understanding of their condition and actively involve them in care planning. Hong et al. [33] designed an interactive system that helps families and clinicians review radiology imaging results by providing simplified definitions and diagrams of medical terms during consultations. Tunnell et al. [67] developed a personal health record (PHR) prototype for smartphones to improve communication efficiency between patients and clinicians by allowing easy retrieval of personal health information. However, while these technologies offer valuable support for the information gap in routine clinical settings, they are not fully equipped to handle the high-stakes, time-sensitive nature of ICU admissions for"}, {"title": "2.3 Al-Supported Clinical Information Technologies", "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and models have demonstrated transformative potential to enhance decision-making, streamline workflows, and improve outcomes for both patients and healthcare professionals In clinical settings. Researchers have successfully developed AI-based clinical pre-screening systems (e.g., for diagnostic triage) [74], risk prediction algorithms (e.g., for sepsis risk prediction) [64, 77], and automated information processing (e.g., EHR summarization) [18, 28, 50]. These innovations have primarily targeted healthcare providers to optimize clinical workflow efficiency and reduce clinicians' cognitive burdens in high-pressure environments [30]. Existing Al solutions in critical care settings prioritize clinical workflow optimization (e.g., predictive analytics for resource allocation) [30] and direct patient monitoring (e.g., AI-based vital sign analysis) [80].\nA growing body of work has also explored patient-centered AI technologies, such as symptom-tracking chatbots [36], personalized treatment recommendation systems, and tools to improve patient-provider communication [75]. While these efforts emphasize clinical stakeholders and patients, they largely overlook the critical role of family caregivers, particularly in the ICU. In ICU contexts, caregivers serve as intermediaries between clinicians and patients, advocating for care preferences, interpreting complex medical information, and making time-sensitive decisions under significant emotional duress. Despite the critical role, their experiences and needs remain understudied in AI-based healthcare research. This gap is particularly problematic in ICUs, where caregivers must rapidly assimilate high-stakes information (e.g., prognostic uncertainty, treatment trade-offs) while coordinating with care provider teams.\nThe lack of focus on caregivers reflects a broader oversight in human-centered AI design: systems often fail to account for indirect end-users who lack formal medical training but bear responsibility for care decisions. For example, Al tools designed to improve clinician-patient communication [75] rarely consider how caregivers might misinterpret or operationalize AI-generated insights. This disconnect underscores an urgent need to reconceptualize Al systems as caregiver-facing tools, capable of distilling complex data into contextually relevant, emotionally sensitive, and ethically transparent guidance tailored to caregivers' literacy levels, cultural contexts, and decision-making autonomy."}, {"title": "3 Formative Study: Method", "content": "We conducted a formative study that aims to explore the challenges experienced by family members of older adult patients in critical care settings, particularly with respect to accessing and understanding clinical information, their coping strategies and limitations of existing supportive technologies.

Building on their caregiving experiences, participants were also prompted to share their interactions with technologies that assisted their information-seeking process, if any. The detailed semi-structured interview protocol can be found in Appendix A.\nThe interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom and lasted approximately 40-60 minutes each. All sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed with participants' consent. We employed an inductive approach to analyze the data [66]. Two researchers independently coded the transcripts, discussed and reconciled the initial coding schema, and iteratively refined it to ensure clarity and consistency.

Many interviewees (N = 8) expressed frustration about their limited access to patient information, which relied solely on verbal updates from the ICU healthcare team. This limitation stemmed from the care provider team's demanding and tightly scheduled workflow, leaving caregivers overly dependent on sporadic conversations with clinicians for critical information. As P1 described, this experience often left him feeling like he was left in the dark: \"There were times when I had to seek out doctors or nurses for updates.... I sometimes felt that my patients were seen as an interruption to the busy ICU schedule... on cases where I don't get information, I don't get to know what was going on,...

This reduces reliance on fragmented verbal updates and empowers remote monitoring.\n\u2022 DG2: Demystify medical terminology with tailored granularity: Integrate AI-powered tools that translate jargon into context-aware, EHR-linked explanations. These systems should adapt to caregivers' expertise levels, reducing dependency on external searches or clinician cross-validation.\n\u2022 DG3: Facilitate structured clinical conversations: Deploy conversational agents that suggest context-relevant questions (e.g., post-consultation clarifications) and scaffold dialogue frameworks.

The top section features a chronological timeline highlighting critical milestones (e.g., ventilator placement and antibiotic changes), enabling caregivers to track progress and anticipate care transitions. Below, a daily overview organizes information into three purpose-driven modules: (1) Al-generated summary synthesizes lab results (e.g., trending creatinine levels) into plain-language insights, reducing cognitive load in parsing raw data; (2) Treatment for the Day details interventions (e.g., medication schedules with purpose explanations) and key procedures, fostering transparency in clinical workflows and (3) Goals for the Day outlines actionable priorities (e.g., \u201cMonitor blood pressure stabilization\u201d), aligning caregivers with care-team objectives to mitigate feelings of exclusion."}, {"title": "5.2 Participants and Procedures", "content": "We recruited the same six caregivers from Section 3 to conduct a heuristic evaluation of our system.

In this paper, we present only mock data to illustrate the user interface.\nFor each design concept, we allocated 10-15 minutes for participants to explore its potential applications. After an introduction to each interface, participants were encouraged to interact with its features, share their impressions, and evaluate its usefulness in tracking a patient's status. They also discussed how they might have used the tools to access and interpret medical information, which aspects were most helpful, and what improvements could enhance usability.\nA detailed semi-structured interview protocol is provided in Appendix B."}, {"title": "6 Evaluation Study: Results", "content": "This study seeks to evaluate and contextualize the impact of our proposed prototype, which was developed to address the technological and informational challenges uncovered in formative study.

Building on findings from formative study, which revealed that caregivers struggle with inconsistent information structuring and accessibility in ICU workflows, the timeline interface directly addresses a critical gap: caregivers often rely on fragmented clinical communications, making it challenging to synthesize a holistic understanding of a patient's condition and treatment trajectory. A unified interface that visualizes patient progress over time could address this gap by enhancing caregivers' situational awareness-enabling them to track trends, identify critical events, and make timely decisions. For example, P6 emphasized the timeline's utility in"}, {"title": "6.1.1 Make Al-generated Summaries Balancing Simplicity and Depth", "content": "Al-generated summaries of patient statuses, while effective for providing family caregivers with a rapid overview, also revealed the need to balance actionable simplicity with contextual depth. Participants acknowledged the utility of streamlined summaries for initial ori- entation-particularly in high-stress ICU environments where cognitive load is a pressing concern. However, they emphasized that oversimplification risked stripping away medically relevant context, hindering their ability to interpret care decisions or advocate meaningfully for patients. For instance, P10 stressed the necessity of integrating prior medical history into summaries to contextualize acute conditions, noting: \"Any [other] information I would like to see there was, like, personal information about the patient... What I'm talking about is the previous illness of the patient... if the patient is having any other illness, any other disease\". Similarly, caregivers sought granular, actionable insights behind high-level summaries, such as interpretations of diagnostic test results. As P7 argued, \"[I want to know more details about] after the test is conducted, either blood test or any test, what they found out after tests\"."}, {"title": "6.1.2 Shared Goals and Care Keeping Caregivers Connected", "content": "For caregivers who cannot always be physically present in the ICU, access to real-time, granular details about their loved one's daily treatments is critical for maintaining a sense of connection and involvement in care. While an interface that outlines medications, dosages, and administration schedules enables caregivers to stay engaged remotely, many participants (N = 4) expressed needs for even deeper levels of transparency to align their emotional and logistical priorities with the care process. For instance, caregivers emphasize the importance of precise timing for drug administration, as highlighted by P7: \"... because even if I'm not around, maybe due to the work purpose, or any situations I could actually know the medication that is actually planned for the day, the dosage. And I do feel like, if possible, the time for this administ to administer the drugs was actually there. It would have been a little bit better, maybe in case of times where I feel like I want to be there when this particular drugs is being administered, and if the time was actually there, I feel like it would have been better....\nBeyond logistical clarity, caregivers also seek insight into the broader arc of care, including how treatments correlate with patient progress. P9 highlighted this need, noting that understanding expected outcomes helps contextualize daily interventions: \"Yeah. It[the goals] like the kind of results (improvements) that we should be expecting, that's the only thing I noticed\". Similarly, P10 stressed the value of linking treatments to patient responses: \u201c[besides providing the treatment,\nI want to know] how he is responding to treatment, [based on] the kind of treatment has been given that day, and the activities of the day\u201d."}, {"title": "6.2 Chatbot", "content": "Participants widely endorsed the AI-based chatbot as a vital tool for delivering timely, in-situ knowledge support within the ICU care ecosystem. The chatbot's ability to synthesize complex medical information into accessible, context-aware responses resonated with caregivers seeking immediacy and reliability. P6 underscored its alignment with modern technological expectations, noting: I think it (the chatbot) helps to understand the system's information, and it's something that... readily available, so it's very helpful...And I think that everyone would use such feature, because right now AI is like a big part of everyone's daily life, so it's something that everyone would be keen to using and trusting\".\n6.2.1 Fact Finder: Delivering Reliable, On-Demand Information. Caregivers prioritized the need for accurate, instant explanations of ICU protocols, equipment, and treatments-a demand met by the chatbot's Fact Finder feature. By distilling technical medical concepts into concise, actionable answers, this functionality reduces ambiguity and empowers caregivers to make informed decisions. For instance, when queried about ventilator use, the chatbot might explain how the device stabilizes oxygen saturation and promotes lung healing, translating abstract mechanisms into tangible patient benefits. The value of this immediacy was emphasized by P8, who described how Fact Finder mitigates delays in understanding urgent care decisions: it actually helps. It helps because there are times whereby you want, you have, you come back, you meet a particular team being administered easily. You can actually, instead of waiting to see a doctor to actually explain, you could actually just use the portal to know the reason why a particular equipment or a particular thing is actually administered\".\n6.2.2 From Complexity to Comprehension: Data Interpreter in Action. Medical data, often dense with jargon and numerical thresholds, can alienate caregivers unfamiliar with clinical terminology. The Data Interpreter addresses this challenge by contextualizing lab results, vital signs, and diagnostic metrics within the patient's unique care trajectory. When confronted with an elevated MCHC level, for example, the chatbot deciphers the acronym, explains its role in assessing blood health, and links abnormalities to potential symptoms or treatment adjustments. This feature also fosters trust by proactively flagging inconsistencies. P7 praised its capacity to detect and clarify potential errors, stating: \u201cYeah,\nif it is from the test that was carried out, if there is, um, kind of mistake somewhere with the digits the number, but the chat votes indicates that there was a mistake, or to just give it answer based on the digits or the numbers that's provided, That's good[ if it will identify the mistake and tell you,]\u201d.\n6.2.3 Preparing for the Future: How Intention Prompter Supports Proactive Care. Beyond reactive support, the Intention\nPrompter equips caregivers to anticipate and navigate future care milestones. By generating contextually relevant questions-such as inquiries about post-discharge mobility aids or rehabilitation plans, the system transforms passive observers into proactive advocates. P7 illustrated this shift, explaining how prompts about crutches or wheelchair readiness shaped their preparedness: \"Yeah, [these catpgproes] Then you can actually know that what to prepare for in the future, maybe is going to use crutches or is going to use a wheelchair. Then it's actually helped me to know what you actually do to actually support at that point. So it's actually very good.\"\nThe feature also structures communication with clinicians, ensuring caregivers retain critical information during consultations. P6 emphasized its role in mitigating cognitive overload: \"Just the questions here would help with like I mentioned, help me prepare questions... because the doctor mentioned so many things that I wouldn't even recall. I wouldn't even understand. But if I had prepared my question before and after, doctor answered, then it helps me understand the situation\". Similarly, P10 noted its role in safeguarding against oversight, even amid fluctuating conditions: \u201c it will help me like, if we have the doctor to give me there certain answer that I needed. Although there might be changes in this."}, {"title": "7 Discussion", "content": "We begin by discussing the potential of our prototypes to reposition family caregivers as integral contributors in clinical settings, moving beyond their traditional role as ancillary stakeholders (Section 7.1).

Finally, we highlight ethical, socio-technical, and privacy concerns associated with the use of technology and AI in real-world implementations (Section 7.3). Finally, we present the limitations of our work and suggest directions for future research (Section 7.4)."}, {"title": "7.1 Beyond Ancillary Roles: Empowering Caregivers as Informal Healthcare Partners", "content": "Our formative study underscores the information needs of family caregivers of older adult patients in critical care settings. It reveals how unmet information needs often leave caregivers feeling excluded in crucial clinical situations for their loved ones, despite their strong desire to provide care. Traditionally, research has framed family caregivers as \"proxies\" or ancillary stakeholders, primarily responsible for assisting clinical care rather than actively contributing to it [11, 21, 24]. Their potential to improve health outcomes has been understated, as they are often perceived as supporting actors rather than integral participants in the care process. This dynamic is especially pronounced in ICU settings, where caregivers frequently act as advocates for critically ill patients who cannot communicate for themselves [7]. Despite this critical role, their contributions are often undervalued, and their integration into the care ecosystem remains limited.\nRecognizing the critical role of familial involvement, recent healthcare research has increasingly acknowledged the importance of integrating family caregivers into clinical settings, proposing frameworks such as family-centered care (FCC) [14, 20, 39] and practices to institutionalize their participation. For instance, initiatives in chronic care and neonatal contexts have demonstrated how structured family engagement can improve patient outcomes and care continuity [43, 72]. In parallel, research in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has adopted an ecological lens to investigate the socio-technical ecosystems surrounding family caregivers in clinical settings. Empirical studies have systematically mapped caregivers' multifaceted roles-from emotional anchoring to logistical orchestration during hospitalizations [10, 46, 54]-while others have designed technologies to scaffold their caregiving labor [40, 51, 60, 61]. For example, Miller et al. [46] delineates how family caregivers navigate fragmented hospital workflows, often compensating for systemic gaps in care coordination. Kong and Karahalios [41] developed a real-time communication platform that bridges family caregivers and clinicians, enabling collaborative interpretation of patient data through shared visualizations. These efforts reflect HCI's growing emphasis on relational infrastructure: designing systems that amplify family caregivers' agency while fostering equitable collaboration within clinical hierarchies.\nOur study advances this discourse by positioning family caregivers as primary stakeholders in critical care ecosystems, challenging their historical framing as peripheral actors. While prior CSCW work has focused on clinical information gathering as a transactional process, our findings reveal how technology can empower caregivers through participatory roles-not just as passive recipients of information, but as active collaborators in care coordination. For instance, Our prototypes feature a context-aware, in-situ chatbot that empowers caregivers by (1) enabling up-to-date, centralized tracking of patients' evolving health data (e.g., vital signs, medication changes) to ensure consistent monitoring and (2) simplifying complex medical terminology via just-in-time, context-aware explanations tailored to caregivers' situational"}, {"title": "7.2 Design Implications for Future Systems", "content": "Our research demonstrates Al systems can meaningfully support family caregivers in high-pressure clinical environ- ments (e.g., ICU) through two key interventions: 1) centralized patient data and 2) real-time Al guidance grounded in clinical evidence. Findings from evaluation study revealed this approach reduces caregivers' cognitive burden and anxiety when navigating rapidly changing health data, particularly when reconciling critical status updates under time-sensitive conditions.\nBased on our findings, we propose a series of design considerations to guide the development of AI-based, family- centered clinical information systems in real-world healthcare settings. Specifically, we explore how the domains of Human-Al collaboration, computational machine learning, and CSCW can leverage their foundational research challenges to advance support for family caregivers.\nFrom the perspective of Human-AI Collaboration: family caregivers face immense cognitive demands in high- stakes clinical environments, where tasks like interpreting lab results, decoding medical jargon, and synthesizing fragmented verbal updates require situational awareness they often lack due to limited medical training. This challenge is compounded by emotional stress, creating a critical need for AI systems that act as collaborative partners rather than mere data tools. Through participatory design sessions, caregivers highlighted how AI could streamline clinical workflows by offloading cognitive labor - for instance, transforming raw EHR data into interpretable summaries, generating context-aware prompts for clinician interactions, or flagging urgent trends in patient status. Crucially, future systems should move beyond passive automation, instead fostering agency-preserving collaboration, where AI serves as a \"thought partner\"- clarifying uncertainties and providing guidance without overriding caregivers' autonomy in decision-making.

However, our findings reveal several ethical, socio-technical, and privacy risks that necessitate proactive mitigation before real-world deployment. Addressing these challenges requires frameworks that prioritize caregiver agency, transparent human-AI collaboration, and contextual adaptability within high-stakes care ecosystems.\nA central tension emerges from Al's dual role as both a support mechanism and a potential stressor. Caregivers in our study acknowledged that AI tools could streamline tasks such as tracking patient status trends but expressed concerns about information overload-particularly when data required frequent, non-essential monitoring. This aligns with broader HCI discussions on trust in automated systems, where the absence of mechanisms for interrogating or contextualizing AI outputs can lead to trust erosion. To mitigate this, AI design must emphasize explainability-for instance, providing plain-language justifications for alerts (e.g., \"This oxygen saturation drop correlates with recent medication changes\")-while ensuring that caregivers retain ultimate control over decision-making.\nPrivacy concerns were equally salient, particularly given caregivers' intermediary role in managing sensitive patient data. Participants recalled prior ICU experiences as information-dense and high-pressure, highlighting the need for auditable, privacy-preserving data practices. Future systems should integrate granular consent mechanisms (e.g., enabling caregivers to opt out of specific data-sharing features) and contextual anonymity (e.g., masking non-essential identifiers in shared interfaces) to align with HCI principles of privacy-by-design.\nwe advocate for Al systems that move beyond task automation to foster collaborative resilience.

First, the scope of our participant pool was limited, with 11 participants in the formative study and 5 in the evaluation phase. While these participants provided valuable insights, the small sample size may limit the generalizability of our findings. Future research should aim to include a larger and more diverse group of caregivers to ensure broader applicability. Second, the prototype developed in this study is a proof-of-concept and has not been integrated with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems or deployed in real-world clinical settings. While the prototype demonstrates the potential of AI-based tools to support caregivers, its effectiveness and usability in practical, high-stakes environments remain untested. Future work should focus on integrating such tools with existing healthcare infrastructures and evaluating their performance in real-world scenarios.\nAdditionally, our study specifically focused on designing a prototype to address caregiver-facing challenges. While this approach provides valuable insights into the needs of family caregivers, it does not fully account for the perspectives of clinicians or other stakeholders in the care process. Future studies should involve clinicians to explore how such tools can facilitate collaboration between caregivers and healthcare providers, ensuring that the design meets the needs of all parties involved. Lastly, while our research primarily addresses the ICU setting, there is a broader need to explore how similar tools can be adapted for other clinical environments. The challenges faced by caregivers in ICUs may differ from those in other settings, such as long-term care facilities or home-based care. Future work should delve deeper into these contexts to develop more versatile and context-aware solutions that can support caregivers across a wide range of healthcare scenarios."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "This study investigated the information needs of family caregivers supporting older adults in critical care environments and designed AI-based prototypes to address their unique challenges. Through a two-stage participatory process, we uncovered the multifaceted complexity of caregivers' information workflows, particularly their struggle to reconcile dy- namic patient health data (e.g., fluctuating lab results, medication changes) with fragmented clinical communication (e.g., jargon-heavy updates, asynchronous consultations). These challenges often exacerbated caregivers' sense of exclusion from care processes, leaving them ill-equipped to advocate effectively for their loved ones. Our prototypes-centered on Al-mediated tools for real-time data interpretation, contextualized communication support, and information scaffold- ing-demonstrated promising potential to empower caregivers. Evaluations revealed that these tools could enhance caregivers' situational awareness (e.g., Centralizing patient status information) and relational agency (e.g., generating plain-language questions for clinicians).

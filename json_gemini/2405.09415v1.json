However, for obtaining this relation, the ABA framework needs to be restricted to being flat, i.e., a fragment where the (defeasible) assumptions can never be entailed, only assumed to be true or false. Here, we remove this restriction and show a correspondence between non-flat ABA and LPs with negation as failure in their head. We then extend this result to so-called set-stable ABA semantics, originally defined for the fragment of non-flat ABA called bipolar ABA. We showcase how to define set-stable semantics for LPs with negation as failure in their head and show the correspondence to set-stable ABA semantics.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Computational argumentation and logic programming constitute fundamental research areas in the field knowledge representation. The correspondence between both research areas has been investigated extensively, revealing that the computational argumentation and logic programming paradigms are inextricably linked and provide orthogonal views on non-monotonic reasoning. In recent years, various researchers developed and studied translations between logic programs (LPs) and several argumentation formalisms, including translation from and to abstract argumentation [9; 21; 4], assumption-based argumentation [2; 18; 3; 17; 20], argumentation frameworks with collective attacks [15],\nclaim-augmented argumentation frameworks [16; 10], and abstract dialectical frameworks [1; 19]. The multitude of different translations sheds light on the close connection of negation as failure and argumentative conflicts.\nInterestingly, all of the above translations consider normal LPs [14], i.e., the class of LPs in which the head of each rule amounts precisely to one positive atom. In this work, we take one step further and consider LPs with negation as failure in the head of rule [13] . We investigate the relation of this more general class of LPs to assumption-based argumentation (ABA) [2]. This is a versatile structured argumentation formalism, modeling argumentative reasoning on the basis of assumptions and inference rules. ABA can be suitably deployed in multi-agent settings to support dialogues [11] and supports applications in, e.g., healthcare [6], law [8] and robotics [12].\nResearch in ABA often focuses on the so-called flat ABA fragment, which prohibits deriving assumptions from inference rules. In this work, we show that generic (potentially non-flat) ABA (referred to improperly but compactly as non-flat ABA [5]) captures the more general fragment of LPs with negation as failure in the head, differently from all of the aforementioned argumentation formalisms. This underlines the increased and more flexible modelling capacities of the generic ABA formalism. We focus on stable [2] and set-stable [7] semantics. While the latter has been originally introduced for a restricted non-flat ABA fragment (bipolar ABA [7]) only, in this paper we adopt it for any non-flat ABA framework and study it in the context of LPs with negation as failure in the head.\nIn more detail, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We show that each LP with negation as failure in the head corresponds to a non-flat ABA framework under stable (model/extension) semantics.\n\u2022 We identify an ABA fragment (LP-ABA) in which the correspondence to LPs with negation as failure in the head is 1-1. We extend this result to the class of all non-flat ABA frameworks by showing that each ABA framework can be mapped into an LP-ABA framework.\n\u2022 We introduce set-stable model semantics for LPs with negation as failure in the head. First, we identify the LP fragment corresponding to bipolar ABA under set-stable semantics. Second, we consider the set-stable semantics for any LPs with negation as failure in the head by appropriate adaptions of the reduct underpinning stable models [13]. Third, with the help of our correspondence result, we reveal shortcomings of the generalisation of the set-stable semantics to the general (non-bipolar) non-flat ABA case.\nFull proofs can be found in the supplementary material."}, {"title": "Background", "content": "Logic programs with negation as failure in head. A logic program with negation as failure (naf) in the head [13] (LP in short in the remainder of the paper) consists of a set of rules r of the form\n$a_0 \\leftarrow a_1,..., a_m, not b_{m+1},..., not b_n$\n$not a_0 \\leftarrow a_1,..., a_m, not b_{m+1},..., not b_n$\nwhere $n \\geq 0$, each $a_i$, $b_i$ is a (propositional) atom, and not is the naf operator. The Herbrand Base of an LP P is the set $HB_P$ of all atoms occurring in P. By $HB_P = \\{not p|p\\in HB_P\\}$ we denote the set of all naf-negated atoms.\nFor $r\\in P$, let $head^+(r)=a_0$, and $head^-(r)=not a_0$, respectively, and $body(r) = \\{a_1,...,a_m, not b_{m+1},...,not b_n\\}$. We also write $body^+(r) = \\{a_1,...,a_m\\}$, $body^-(r) = \\{b_{m+1},...,b_n\\}$, and $head^\\bar{}(r) = \\{a_0\\}$ if $head^-(r) = not a_0$ and $head^\\bar{}(r) = \\emptyset$ otherwise (analogously for $head^+(r)$). An LP P is a normal program if $head^\\bar{}(r) = (\\emptyset$ for each $r\\in P$ and a positive program if $body^-(r) = head^-(r) =\\emptyset$ for each $r\\in P$. Given $I \\subseteq HB_P$, the reduct $P^I$ of P is the positive program\n$P^I = \\{head^+(r) \\leftarrow body^+(r) |\\\\\nbody^-(r) \\cap I = \\emptyset, head^-(r) \\subseteq I\\}.$\nWe are ready to define stable LP semantics.\nDefinition 2.1. $I \\subseteq HB_P$ is a stable model [13] of an LP P if I is a $\\subseteq$-minimal Herbrand model of $P^I$, i.e., for each rule $r \\in P^I$ it holds that\n(a) $p\\in I$ if there is $r\\in P^I$ s.t. $head(r)=p$ and $body(r)\\subseteq I$;\n(b) there is no $r \\in P^I$ with $head(r) = \\emptyset$ and $I \\subseteq body(r)$.\nNaf in the head can be also interpreted in terms of (denial integrity) constraints, i.e., rules with empty head.\nExample 2.2. Consider the LP P given as follows.\nP: $p \\leftarrow not q$\n$q \\leftarrow not p$\n$r \\leftarrow$\n$not s \\leftarrow s, not p.$\nHere, P models a choice between p and q. However, as s is factual and not p entails not s (together with the fact s), q is rendered impossible. For the sets $I_1 = \\{p, s\\}$ and $I_2 = \\{q, s\\}$ we obtain the following reducts:\n$P^{I_1} : p \\leftarrow$\n$s \\leftarrow$\nand\n$P^{I_2}: q \\leftarrow$\n$s \\leftarrow$\n$\\emptyset \\leftarrow s.$\nWe see that $I_1$ is a minimal Herbrand model of $P^{I_1}$, whereas $I_2$ is rendered invalid due to the rule $\\emptyset \\leftarrow s$. Thus, this rule can be seen as a constraint amounting to ruling out r."}, {"title": "Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA)", "content": "Let a deductive system be a pair (L, R), where L is a formal language, i.e., a set of sentences, and R is a set of inference rules over L.

Research often focuses on the flat ABA fragment in which each set of assumptions is closed. This restriction has however certain limitations; as the present work demonstrates, non-flat ABA is capable of capturing a more general LP fragment, thus opening up more broader application opportunities. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first correspondence result between an argumentation formalism and a fragment of logic programs which is strictly larger than the class of normal LPs.\nIn this work, we furthermore studied set-stable semantics, originally defined only for bipolar ABAFs, in context of general non-flat ABAFs and LPs. As Example 4.11) indicates, the semantics does not generalise well beyond the bipolar fragment; this raises questions about a reasonable generalisation of set-stable ABA and LP semantics. A further interesting avenue for future work is the development and investigation of three-valued semantics (such as partial-stable or L-stable model semantics) for LPs with negation as failure in the head, in particular in correspondence to their anticipated ABA counter-parts (e.g., complete and semi-stable semantics, respectively)."}, {"title": "Stable Semantics (Proofs of Section 3)", "content": "Lemma 3.3. Let P be an LP, $D_P$ its corresponding ABAF, and I a stable model of P. Then, $x \\in Th_{D_P}(\\Delta(I))$ iff $I \\models_P x$.\nProof. ($\\rightarrow$) Assume $\\Delta(S)$ derives x. By induction over the height of the argument, we show that the claim is satisfied:\nBase case: In case the height of the argument equals to 1, there is $r\\in P$ with $head(r) = x$, $body^+(r) = \\emptyset$, and $body^-(r) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n$n \\rightarrow n + 1$: Assume that the statement holds for all arguments of height smaller than or equal to n. Let r denote the top-rule of the argument $\\Delta(T) \\vdash x$, $\\Delta(T) \\subseteq \\Delta(S)$, of height n + 1 with claim x. The leaves on the first level of the tree-derivation are contained in $\\Delta(T)$, i.e., $body^-(r) \\subseteq A(S)$. Let x' be an internal node on the first level of the tree-derivation. The sub-tree with root x' is an argument of height n. Hence, by induction hypothesis, there is r'$\\in P$ with $head(r') = x'$, $body^+(r') \\subseteq S$, and $body^-(r') \\cap S = \\emptyset$. In case x' is a positive literal, we obtain x'$\\in S$ (by (a)); in case x' is a naf literal, we obtain x'$\\in \\Delta(S)$ (by (b)). Since x' was arbitrary, we obtain $body^+(r) \\subseteq S$ and $body^-(r) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n($\\leftarrow$) Let r$\\in P$ with $head(r) = x$, $body^+(r) \\subseteq S$, and $body^-(r) \\cap S = \\emptyset$. We first show the statement for atoms x$\\in S$.\nWe proceed by induction over the dependency graph of the redundancy-free reduct $P^S$. The dependency graph is a directed graph G = (V, E) with V = $HB_P$ and (v, w)$\\in E$ iff there is a rule r with v$\\in body(r)$ and $head(r) = w$. A\nrule is redundant in a positive program P iff $head(t) = head(t')$ and $body(t) \\subseteq body(t')$ implies t = t' (hence $body(t) = body(t')$) for all t,t'$\\in P$. It can be shown that removing redundant rules does not change the models of P.\nWlog, we can assume that $P^S$ is redundancy-free. The dependency graph of $P^S$ contains nodes without incoming edges (by assumption S$\\neq \\emptyset$ and $\\subseteq$-minimality of S), and each node is reachable from a node without incoming edges (by $\\subseteq$-minimality of S).\nWe proceed by induction by traversing the dependency graph, starting from nodes without incoming edges.\nBase case: x corresponds to a node without incoming edges. Then $body^+(r) = \\emptyset$. Hence $\\{body^-(r)\\} \\vdash x$ is a tree-based argument in $D_P$.\nInduction step: Assume the statement holds for all parents of x. Let $x_1,..., x_n$ denote the parents of x. That is, $body^+(r) = \\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$, and we can construct a tree-based argument $T_i \\vdash x_i$ for each $i \\lt n$. Therefore, $\\bigcup_{i\\lt n} T_i \\cup \\{body^-(r)\\} \\vdash x$ is a tree-based argument for x.\nThis concludes the proof for the case x$\\in S$.\nNow assume x$\\notin S$.\nIn case $body^+(r) = \\emptyset$, we are done. The corresponding tree-based argument is $\\{body^-(r)\\} \\vdash x$.\nIn case $body^+(r) \\neq \\emptyset$, we have S$\\neq \\emptyset$ (since $body^+(r) \\subseteq S$). Let $body^+(r) = \\{x_1,...,x_n\\}$. Since S is stable, it holds that for each $x_i$, there is a rule $r_i$ with $head(r_i) = x_i$, $body^+(r_i) \\subseteq S$, and $body^-(r_i) \\cap S = \\emptyset$. As shown above, we can find a tree-based argument $T_i \\vdash x_i$ for each $i \\lt n$. Hence, $\\bigcup_{i\\lt n} T_i \\cup \\{body^-(r)\\} \\vdash x$ is a tree-based argument for x.\nFrom LP to ABA Below, we prove our first theorem.\nTheorem 3.4.

Improving the accuracy and generalization of PCB defect detection models remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a high-precision, robust, and real-time end-to-end method for PCB defect detection based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Traditional methods often suffer from low accuracy and limited applicability. We propose a novel approach combining YOLOv5 and multiscale modules for hierarchical residual-like connections. In PCB defect detection, noise can confuse the background and small targets. The YOLOv5 model provides a strong foundation with its real-time processing and accurate object detection capabilities. The multi-scale module extends traditional approaches by incorporating hierarchical residual-like connections within a single block, enabling multiscale feature extraction. This plug-and-play module significantly enhances performance by extracting features at multiple scales and levels, which are useful for identifying defects of varying sizes and complexities. Our multi-scale architecture integrates feature extraction, defect localization, and classification into a unified network. Experiments on a large-scale PCB dataset demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to existing methods.

Given that PCB defects can compromise the functionality and safety of electronic devices, leading to reduced corporate yields, ensuring the quality and reliability of PCBs is crucial. This guarantee helps maintain the performance and longevity of electronic products [3].\nDespite advances in automatic optical inspection (AOI) and the emergence of deep learning-based detectors for PCB defect detection, several research gaps and challenges persist within this domain:\n(1) Robustness to Manufacturing Variability: Existing methods, including AOI and traditional deep learning detectors, often struggle to maintain high detection accuracy in the face of manufacturing variability, such as variations in PCB layout, component placement, and soldering conditions. Robust defect detection techniques are needed that can handle these variations effectively.\n(2) Domain Adaptation and Generalization: Although deep learning-based detectors show promise in detecting defects, they can struggle with domain adaptation when deployed in diverse manufacturing environments or when confronted with new types of defects not seen during training. For example, DeepPCB [36] uses black-and-white images, whereas HRIPCB [37] employs color image representation. This difference in imaging methods and image representation impacts the compatibility and usability of the datasets, thereby adversely affecting the training and performance of detection models. Therefore, methods to enhance the generalizability of these models in different PCB configurations and manufacturing conditions are essential.\n(3) Real-time performance [1]: Real-time defect detection remains a challenge, particularly for complex PCBs with densely packed components. Methods that balance accuracy with real-time processing speed are necessary for practical industrial applications."}, {"title": "2 Related works", "content": "In modern industrial scenarios, as the core component of electronic equipment, the printing circuit board (PCB) plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and stability of the product [43]. However, in the entire manufacturing and application of PCB, various defects and problems are often encountered. In order to ensure the quality of PCB, the industry uses various methods to perform defect detection and electricity testing."}, {"title": "2.1 Manual Defect Detection Methods", "content": "Defect detection has been a crucial aspect in the field of PCB manufacturing. Traditional manual visual inspection stands as one of the primary methods employed. This method relies heavily on operators that use tools such as magnifying glasses or calibrated microscopes to inspect the quality of circuit boards, making judgments based on their skills and experience with respect to the need for rectification [19]. However, this visually dependent inspection method exhibits certain limitations, with subjective estimation being the most noticeable risk. Subjective judgments of the operator can lead to erroneous detection results, affecting the quality and performance of the product, increasing the risk of industrial accidents such as fires caused by cable shorts or connection errors, and consequently reducing the safety of the production line [8]. Moreover, this method highly depends on the skills and experience of operators, necessitating factories to allocate substantial financial resources to recruit proficient personnel. Even the most experienced experts may err due to subjective estimation, resulting in inaccurate detection outcomes [20]. Therefore, manual visual inspection methods are increasingly becoming unsuitable for practical production tasks [18]."}, {"title": "2.2 Automatic Optical Inspection", "content": "AOI based on machine vision (AOI) is a technology utilized for the detection of surface defects and abnormalities present on electronic components. It employs cameras and image processing algorithms to scan and analyze components and connection points on the printed circuit board (PCB), aiming to identify potential defects such as short circuits, open circuits, poor soldering, incorrect soldering, etc. [23]. Specifically, the operational principle of AOI (Automatic Optical Inspection) is rooted in machine vision technology, employing red, green, and blue LED lights to illuminate PCB components [21]. It utilizes the principle of optical reflection to depict the soldering conditions of components on the PCB. Subsequently, it employs cameras or sensors to capture and analyze images of the printed circuit board (PCB) for the detection of defects within PCB components. Additionally, this method incorporates various innovative and improved techniques, such as automatic X-ray inspection (AXI), two-dimensional automated optical inspection (2D AOI), and three-dimensional automated optical inspection (3D AOI), for PCB defect recognition [1]. However, current automatic optical inspection (AOI) techniques are susceptible to the effects of ambient light, leading to significant distortion in captured images and an increase in misjudgment rates during the detection process [22]. In order to address this issue, although many PCB manufacturers opt for manual reevaluation, this undoubtedly incurs additional labor costs, resulting in resource wastage."}, {"title": "Machine Learning-based Detectors", "content": "To overcome the time-consuming nature and reliance on a large number of reference images associated with traditional image processing methods, many researchers have turned to machine learning algorithms [32]. The current main research methods for PCB image defect detection based on machine learning can be divided into supervised learning (BP neural network, SVM), unsupervised learning (PCA, clustering methods), and semi-supervised learning [24] [25] [26]. These algorithms have become a focal point of research in the field of PCB defect detection, encompassing numerous classical machine learning algorithms. Through these methods, the detection of solder joints and components can be performed more rapidly and accurately, offering new possibilities for quality control in the PCB manufacturing process. Furthermore, despite the capability of image subtraction-based methods to achieve high-precision detection of PCB defects, machine learning algorithms excel in enhancing efficiency and accuracy, making them a viable choice in certain circumstances [4]. A common approach, as explained by Yun et al. [9], utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in conjunction with a tiered circular illumination technique to inspect PCB solder joints. The researchers assembled a dataset comprising 402 solder joints for training and testing the model, achieving defect detection rates of 96. 07% and 98%, respectively. In particular, this performance exceeds that of alternative methods, including the K-means classifier [10] and the back-propagation (BP) classifier [11]. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that this method encounters several challenges, such as the selection of hyperparameters C and kernel in SVM, alongside the necessity for a sophisticated three-color circular illumination system."}, {"title": "Deep Learning-based Detectors", "content": "Deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) including deep CNN (DCNN) [12], VGG neural network [31], [30] and ResNet neural network [11], [33], etc., have been widely applied in various fields such as image processing, classification, object detection, and segmentation [27]. These methods automatically extract image features, simplifying the image preprocessing process and effectively enhancing the accuracy and speed of detection. Compared to traditional detection methods, CNN-based approaches demonstrate strong robustness to environmental factors and noise. Across diverse datasets, CNN-based object detection algorithms exhibit excellent performance, serving as the primary driving force in the advancement of object detection. Consequently, deep learning algorithms have garnered the attention of researchers for PCB defect detection, achieving commendable detection performance [4].\nIn general, PCB detection methods based on deep learning can be classified into two categories: two-stage and single-stage approaches. Among the most commonly used methods for detecting PCB defects are the two-stage target detection algorithms: Region-Based Convolutional Network (R-CNN) [47] and one-stage target detection algorithms: You Only Look Once (YOLO) series [48], Single shot multi-box detector (SSD) [49]. The important point to note is that Faster R-CNN [5] is an improved object detection model developed based on R-CNN [6] and Fast R-CNN [7]. Compared to the two-stage approach, the YOLO series, although relatively less precise, boasts a higher detection speed. Furthermore, due to its end-to-end architecture, the YOLO series is relatively simple to implement and is thus widely favored in the industrial domain. Ding et al. [12] introduced TDD-net, a novel micro-defect detection network based on faster R-CNN. Inspired by YOLOv2 [13], the method autonomously determines anchor scales suitable for PCB images. By employing various data augmentation techniques and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) [14], high detection accuracy (98.9% mAP) is achieved. However, TDD-net operates as a two-stage framework, resulting in a large parameter count and a slower detection speed. The use of fully connected layers increases the complexity of the model, while Rol pooling may compromise the translational invariance of features. Despite its strong performance in defect detection, challenges remain in assessing real-time applicability and sensitivity to parameters. CFIL [9] proposes a frequency-domain feature extraction module and feature interaction in the frequency domain to enhance salient features. MFC [11] proposes a frequency-domain filtering module to achieve dense target feature enhancement. Adibhatla et al. [16] utilized YOLOv5 [17] for PCB defect detection, improving accuracy through data augmentation and improved model backbone, with the largest model achieving a detection accuracy of 99.74%. However, the method only distinguished between defective and non-defective targets without classifying defect types and exhibited low defect confidence scores. Additionally, to reduce computational costs, detection was performed only on small cropped images, potentially limiting real-time detection across entire PCB images."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "The primary objective of this research is to develop an advanced PCB defect detection method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address the limitations of traditional inspection techniques.

Data collection and pre-processing techniques for PCB images involve the acquisition of a diverse dataset of PCB images representing various types of defects and manufacturing conditions. Since most PCB defect visual inspection systems, particularly those based on machine learning and deep learning techniques, are fundamentally data driven, addressing PCB defect data preprocessing constitutes a crucial step in the process. Specifically, preprocessing techniques include image augmentation (generation of synthetic data to increase dataset diversity and robustness), normalization and standardization (rescaling and normalizing pixel values to facilitate model training), and noise reduction (application of filtering and denoising techniques to enhance image clarity)."}, {"title": "3.2 Deep Representation Methods for PCB Defect Detection", "content": "Our work focuses on capturing discriminative information from PCB images using advanced feature extraction methods. We leverage pre-trained CNNs, such as ResNet and VGG, for automatic feature extraction from PCB images. We employ localization techniques, using region-based or sliding-window approaches, to pinpoint defects within PCB images.\nOur training strategies emphasize optimizing model performance and generalization. We select appropriate loss functions, such as categorical cross-entropy, to train CNNs on imbalanced defect datasets. To avoid overfitting, we apply regularization techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and weight regularization. Additionally, we iteratively tuned model hyperparameters, including learning rate and batch size, to optimize performance metrics.\nUnderstanding the importance of the loss function in machine learning and statistical modeling, we recognize it as a mathematical function that maps the difference between the predicted output of our model and the true labels to a non-negative real number, representing the prediction error or risk level of the model. Our goal is to minimize this loss function to optimize our model, enabling it to make more accurate predictions on unseen data.\nFor the YOLOv5 series, the loss function that we use consists mainly of four components: localization error, confidence error with object, confidence error without object, and classification error. By addressing these components, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of our model in PCB defect detection. By comprehensively considering the optimization of these four parts, we obtain the loss function of YOLOv5, which can be expressed as follows:\n$L_{YOLOV5} = \\lambda_{Coord} \\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \\sum_{j=0}^{B} I_{ij}^{obj} [(x_i-\\hat{x_i})^2 + (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2]$\n$+ \\lambda_{Coord} \\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \\sum_{j=0}^{B} I_{ij}^{obj} [(\\sqrt{w_i} - \\sqrt{w_i})^2 + (\\sqrt{h_i} - \\sqrt{h_i})^2]$\n$+  \\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \\sum_{j=0}^{B} (C_i-\\hat{C_i})^2$\n$+ \\lambda_{noobj} \\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \\sum_{j=0}^{B} I_{ij}^{noobj} (C_i - \\hat{C_i})^2$\n$+ \\sum_{i=0}^{S^2} \\sum_{ce\\in classes}(P_i(c) - \\hat{P_i(c)})^2$         (1)\nDuring the training process of the YOLOv5 model, the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is employed. This widely used optimization algorithm calculates the gradients of the model parameters based on the loss function and updates the parameters using optimization methods such as gradient descent to minimize the loss function. In the process of this algorithm, comparing the actual output (y) with the expected output (r) yields an error signal. This error signal is propagated back through each layer of the neural network, propagating layer by layer, and computing the error signal for each layer. Subsequently, by adjusting the connection weights of each layer to minimize error, the performance of the neural network is optimized."}, {"title": "3.3 YOLOv5 combined with Res2Net module", "content": "The Res2Net [44] architecture advances convolutional neural networks (CNN) by introducing a multiscale feature extraction mechanism.

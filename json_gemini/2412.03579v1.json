{"title": "Towards a Practical Ethics of Generative AI in Creative Production Processes", "authors": ["Geert Hofman"], "abstract": "The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various domains, including design and creative processes, raises important ethical questions. While much has been written about AI ethics from the perspective of technology developers, less attention has been given to the practical ethical considerations for technology consumers, particularly in the context of design. This paper proposes a framework for navigating the ethical challenges of using AI in creative production processes, such as the double diamond design model. Drawing on six major ethical theories - virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, contract theory, care ethics, and existentialism - we develop a \"compass\" for zooming in and out on the ethical aspects of AI in the design process. The framework emphasizes the importance of responsibility, anticipation, and reflection at each stage of the AI lifecycle as well as at each step of the creative process. We argue that by adopting a playful and exploratory approach to AI, while remaining grounded in fundamental ethical principles, designers can harness the potential of these technologies in a responsible and value-aligned way without over-burdening or compromising the creative process to much.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become more powerful and pervasive, they are increasingly being used in a wide range of domains, including design and creative processes. The creative sector has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies and methodologies, but with the advent of generative AI, capable of autonomously generating new images, texts, and concepts, there is talk of a potential paradigm shift in how creative professionals will do their work. Recent developments raise concerns about the possibility of machines replacing human creativity, and the role of the designer becoming subordinate to the role of the machine.\nAI offers opportunities for creative professions, but there are also many challenges that need to be investigated to implement its application in a balanced and responsible manner. Finding a balance between human and machine creativity, ensuring human involvement during the design process, and addressing ethical, legal, and ecological implications are crucial issues to analyze before fully integrating the applications into daily business operations.\nMuch of the existing literature on AI ethics has focused on the responsibilities of technology developers, with less attention given to the practical ethical considerations for technology consumers, like professional designers in diverse creative industries, who mainly use AI in prepackaged configurable tools. This paper seeks to address this gap by proposing a framework for navigating the governance and ethical challenges of using AI in creative production processes, such as the double diamond design model."}, {"title": "Ethics for AI in design", "content": "In an era where generative Al is rapidly reshaping the creative industry - encompassing creative agencies, web agencies, product designers, marketeers, and communication professionals \u2013 the role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is becoming increasingly pivotal. Research into Al governance and ethics can help creating a framework or compass for balancing innovation with responsibility.\nGenerative Al offers teams in the creative sector unprecedented opportunities, from personalized design solutions to Al-driven marketing strategies. However, the integration of Al also brings forth significant challenges. The potential for Al-generated content to inadvertently embody biases or inaccuracies necessitates a robust governance structure. Integrating ethical considerations into Al governance is essential for ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability.\nMoreover, the creative sector often deals with intellectual property and originality \u2013 areas where Al's impact is still being understood. This underscores the need for research that defines clear ethical guidelines and governance models to navigate these uncharted waters.\nAnother critical aspect is data privacy and security, especially for SMEs handling sensitive client information. As Al systems process vast amounts of data, SMEs must ensure compliance with evolving data protection regulations such as the European data (protection) act and Al act. Integration of Al governance guidelines with existing organizational structures therefore becomes crucial.\nFurthermore, as the creative sector is known for its innovation and flexibility, SMEs must also consider the cultural impact of Al integration. Research in Al governance should thus include strategies for maintaining a human-centric approach, ensuring that Al tools augment rather than replace human creativity and judgment.\nAs there are risks associated with the over-reliance on Al, including the potential loss of critical thinking and creativity skills, which are core to the creative sector, ethical Al governance should promote a balanced approach, leveraging Al's capabilities while nurturing human talent and creativity.\nIn this article opportunities for teams in the creative sector are sketched, showing them that Al governance and ethics, not only is becoming a regulatory necessity but also a strategic imperative. It ensures that while they leverage Al for innovation and competitive advantage, they also uphold ethical standards and contribute positively to the societal and economic fabric. A well-defined Al governance framework is instrumental in navigating the complex landscape of Al ethics and ensuring responsible, fair, and transparent Al use in the creative sector. It should be part of every creative teams' toolbox."}, {"title": "The team", "content": "In large teams it won't always be possible to make every team member sufficiently ethically informed and responsible. In these cases it is advisable to give one or more team members the extra role of ethical conductor (in the sense of an orchestral conductor). This conductor (or conductor sub-team) can guide the rest of the team on a responsible path using the necessary tools as described in the next section."}, {"title": "Use, think, try", "content": "The Al lifecycle encompasses several critical stages: creation, production, implementation, instruction, consumption, and policymaking. While other divisions within an Al application's lifecycle are certainly possible, these stages have the most significant impact when considering questions of responsibility. At each stage, there are different stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests and ethical considerations. A key challenge is anticipating and mitigating negative consequences while promoting positive outcomes. This needs to be done taking the life cycle stage where the design process is in, into account.\nWhen talking about creative agencies, product designers and marketeers or communication designers, mostly SMEs, the target group of our research, this is primarily the consumption stage of Al, that is, using and configuring Al tools. In such a case there are a lot of upstream governance and ethical considerations been thrown into the lap of the creative designer. Clearly the creative designer cannot be held responsible for all aspects of the Al tool. To be able to handle this upstream legacy, the use of labels for certain important ethical criteria can help relieve the professional end user of part of the ethical burden. These would need to be agreed upon by as many stakeholders involved in Al as possible. There should be representatives from industry, academia, government and non-governmental organisations validating these labels with an as wide as possible geographic distribution. In the food industry the Nutriscore and Eco-score labels are well known examples.\nThe primary labels that could be used in the context of Al and that are sufficiently aligned with attainable SMART goals, are transparancy and sustainability. It should be relatively easy to agree on relevant criteria for a decent and widely supported label. In an upcoming experiment with some of our user group we will deploy a proper label for transparancy."}, {"title": "The importance of labeling (use)", "content": "Labeling and reporting is a two-way street."}, {"title": "Al ethics theories as lenses (think)", "content": "There are several major ethical theories that can inform our approach to Al ethics. The theories mentioned here are certainly not the only possibilities. There is also often an overlap between these theories, certainly when one digs a bit deeper in the specific writings of the authors mentioned. The authors used in this article to illustrate the theory, are the main founders or early practitioners of it on the one hand, and some contemporary thinkers that try to fit the theory in a digitally enabled world on the other. The main reason to make the distinction between these theories, is the practicality of using them as lenses to look at the world in an ethically informed way.\nVirtue ethics, traditionally associated with thinkers like Aristotle or Confucius, focuses on the moral character of individuals and the cultivation of virtues. According to Shannon Valor, one of the contemporary proponents of this theory, Al should enhance human virtues such as wisdom, care, and creativity rather than undermine them. This approach advocates for \"technomoral futures\" where technology development is value-driven.\nDeontological ethics, rooted in the works of Immanuel Kant, emphasizes adherence to universal rules and the importance of duty. Ava Thomas Wright's concept of \"rightful machines\" underscores the importance of designing Al systems that operate within a framework of legal and moral obligations, ensuring their actions do not infringe upon others' freedoms."}, {"title": "Six lenses", "content": "Consequentialist ethics, primarily known in its utilitarian form, with thinkers like Jeremy Bentham or John Stuart Mill, evaluates the moral worth of actions based on their outcomes. A current philosopher like Nick Bostrom highlights the importance of considering the long-term consequences of Al, advocating for the development of friendly Al to prevent catastrophic risks and ensure beneficial outcomes for humanity.\nContract ethics, originally linked to Hobbes, but in the modern age inspired by John Rawls and Robert Nozick, involves establishing ethical principles through a hypothetical social contract. Mathias Risse is a contemporary theorist who extends this framework to technology, emphasizing the need for fairness and justice in Al development, ensuring that Al technologies benefit all societal members equitably. He goes somewhat further than the typical contract ethics vision and tries incorporating Marxist and feminist ethics.\nCare ethics, often connected to feminist theory, prioritizes human dignity and relationships. It's a rather recent development in ethical theory associated with people like Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings. In a certain way one could also consider Emmanuel Levinas someone close to the core principals of care ethics, although he is certainly not reducible to this school. Virginia Dignum tries to apply the principals of care ethics in the context of Al systems. Respect for human dignity, with policies enforcing ethical standards is what she tries to realize in theory as well as in practice. This perspective aligns closely with deontological principles, emphasizing the role of policy in ensuring ethical Al.\nFinally, existential ethics, rooted in the theories of Kierkegaard and Sartre, as proposed by Petros Terzis, emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility. In the context of Al, this approach suggests that individuals and organizations must navigate their interactions with Al systems responsibly, acknowledging the impact of their choices on their identity and society."}, {"title": "Zooming in and out", "content": "Inspired by the double diamond design model, our proposed framework involves a process of zooming in and out on the ethical dimensions of Al in creative production processes. This model was inspired by the article of Luke Munn on \u201cThe uselessness of Al ethics\". This somewhat provocative article doesn't explicitly refer to the double diamond or the creative process, but tries to show that using Al ethics principles to make Al development more ethical is not only useless but even a dangerous distraction.\nOne way to take on the problem of ethics in Al is described in an interview later as zooming in and zooming out. Here we reuse this terminology in a similar way in the context of the creative process that makes use of Al.\nZooming out means looking at the bigger picture related to Al tools and their use. It tries to zoom out to a level where societal and environmental needs come in the picture. It involves considering the broader context and values at stake, drawing on the six ethical theories outlined above. In the examples in Table 1 this concerns the macro level. Although we are focusing here on the aspects related to the use of Al, this is often not only relevant in that context. The assignment, challenge or campaign itself, the diversity of the team, the governance structure of the company and other more general aspects surrounding the teams' work are part of this zooming out phase. Zooming out is looking at what you are doing with a helicopter view. The zooming out phase typically happens at the big transition moments in the double diamond process: at the start of the process, between the problem and the solution phase (at every iteration) and at the end of the process before concluding or deciding to re-iterate.\nOn the other hand, zooming in can occur more frequently and is looking at a more detailed level. In the table this is primarily described in the micro and meso level. It is mostly focusing on the effects of the tool use on the team itself and its direct stakeholders. In principle it could be done before and after each phase where Al tools are being used. It also very useful in the planning phase, when deciding which tools to use for the task. It can also be called upon by every participant in the creative process, team members as well as external stakeholders. In case there is a conductor for the team (as described in the The Team section), it is his responsibility to detect the necessity for a zooming in stop. Every zooming in moment can mean conducting small experiments to test the effects of Al interventions, gathering feedback from users, and iterating based on the results, but it could also involve doing some extra research, it all depends on the concrete case.\nThe table below gives an overview of some typical questions that might come up in a creative process using Al tools or integrating Al tools in a solution."}, {"title": "Contstraints as enablers", "content": "Although it might seem that in the use and think phase we have only added constraints, this doesn't have to mean that everything becomes more difficult. Creativity and problem solving can thrive when boundaries emerge, given the right circumstances. It's by rubbing one constraint against another, that new possibilities and opportunities arise. For teams able to accept and embrace these constraints, there is freedom in them."}, {"title": "Playful exploration (try)", "content": "Finally, our framework encourages a spirit of playful exploration in the use of Al for creative production. Rather than viewing Al only as a tool for optimizing efficiency or replacing human judgment, we suggest approaching it with a sense of curiosity, experimentation, and open-ended inquiry. This might involve using Al to generate unexpected ideas or challenge assumptions, while remaining grounded in fundamental ethical principles. It also means, using Al to do small scale experiments before relying on it for real production efforts.\nBy adopting a playful mindset, the many ethically questionable aspects of Al can be used to open up our view of the world. Knowing that images, texts and concepts produced by generative Al are infested with bias, unfairness, opacity, misinformation and hallucinations can be used as a kind of mirror of ourselves. The recent book \"The Al Mirror: How to Reclaim Our Humanity in an Age of Machine Thinking\" by Shannon Vallor seems to suggest this too. The current generation of generative Al is not the onset of beginning general intelligence. It is however a multi-faceted mirror reflecting our own good and bad traits.\nUsing Al realizing this conundrum opens possibilities of creative exploration that previously weren't there. Just as Tyler Reigeluth describes, looking at generative Al as just a way to promote efficiency and forgetting that it's in first instance a wonderful playing machine, leads us in a direction we definitely do not want. Machines and Al are not here to replace us, but need to be used as playmates (without the erotic innuendo). In that guise they are creativity enhancing tools that, when used properly, can help deliver ethically sound solutions to ethically sound tasks and problems."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "As Al technologies become increasingly integrated into creative production processes, it is essential for practitioners to develop a framework for navigating the ethical challenges and opportunities they present. By drawing on diverse ethical theories and emphasizing the importance of anticipation, reflection, and playful exploration, our proposed framework offers a practical approach for using Al in a responsible and value-aligned way. While there are no easy answers to the complex ethical questions raised by Al, we believe that by engaging with these issues in a proactive and principled manner, the design community can play a leading role in shaping the future of these powerful technologies."}]}

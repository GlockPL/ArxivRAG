INTRODUCTION", "content": "Systems are open when interacting with the environment to maintain their identity, autonomy, and purpose (Rosnay J., 1980). Identity distinguishes the system (enterprise, business process or unit) from other systems. Autonomy refers to the decision-making process of the system to maintain its organization (soul of the enterprise, business process, or business unit) and its structure (body of enterprise, business process, or business unit). The purpose refers to the objectives of the system (enterprise, business process or unit) to maintain the organization (soul) of the structure (body) over time (the structure change). Open systems take in inputs, which are utilized and transformed within the system (such as an enterprise or process), to produce outputs. These outputs can be services or products resulting from the transformation, which are then delivered to the environment. Closed systems are those that lack either inputs or outputs, meaning they do not interact with their environment. All activities occur within the system, and the results of any transformations or operations stay contained inside. A specific type of closed system (organizational closure) is an autopoietic system. Autopoietic systems are closed systems concerning their organization, but open in their structure. The result of its operation remains in the system. There is no interaction with the environment. People are not autopoietic systems, but rather the nervous system that makes them (Maturana and Varela, Theory of Autopoiesis of Santiago) (Varela F., 2007). Enterprises are not autopoietic systems, but the business units (processes) that constitute them (Limone and Bastias, Theory of Autopoiesis of Valpara\u00edso) (Limone and Bastias, 2006)."}, {"title": "II. SOCIOTECHNICAL APPROACH", "content": "Systems Every organization\u2014whether a family, enterprise, business process, or unit is, by definition (Bravo J., 1998), \"an organized group of human beings.\" Understanding these organizations requires examining their interactions and relationships, as what affects one part can impact the whole both now and in the future. An enterprise (or business process/unit) is defined as a living system that is self-aware and viable through its interactions with its environment (business ecosystem, see Figure 1). To survive and evolve, the enterprise must understand itself, its customers, and its suppliers. Platforms such as supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and customer relationship management (CRM) can assist in this endeavor."}, {"title": "A. OID Model", "content": "The Le Moigne OID model (see Figure 3) organizes the enterprise (business process or unit) at all time t into three systems: OS operational system, IS information system, and DS decision system (Le Moigne J-L., 1990). These systems interact with each other through variables and values. Figure 3 presents an intervention of Le Moigne OID model, presented in \u00abLA MODELISATION DES SYSTEMES COMPLEXES\u00bb.\nAt all times t the OS transforms inputs from providers (such raw materials, energy, goods, workflows, and other resources) into outputs to customers (products or services). The IS stores the values of OS's variables and compares them with the target values set by the DS. The DS controls these objectives and adjusts the OS's variable values to ensure alignment with the desired goals.\nThe OS is an open system, while the IS and DS are considered closed systems. The absence of entry and exit arrows in Figure 3 emphasizes that the IS and DS are closed with respect to their internal organization but open in terms of their structure. The OID model preserves the unity and identity of the system as a whole at all time t. Rather than being viewed as a single system, the OID model should be understood as comprising multiple systems. This is because there are multiple operational systems within the OS, as well as multiple information systems (IS) and decision systems (DS). This is very well explained in \u00abTHE EVOLUTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOWARDS AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS WITH PERSONALITY SIMULATION\u00bb by (Colloc J., 2024), see Figure 4: \"On level 6, the system becomes able to memorize his decision O.I.D (Operating system (OS), Information system (IS), System of Decision (DS)). On level 7, the system coordinates numerous decisions of actions at all the time t, concerning its internal activity, regulation and the external information from and to its environment (SCS). On level 8, the system is endowed with a subsystem of imagination and design (SID). On level 9, the system is able to decide on its decision and to determine the positive and negative aspects of its actions. This finalization of a complex system is close to the human thought (FS) which confers it an autonomy of decision allowing it to set its own goals. Autonomous multiagents systems (AMAS) belongs to this kind Le Moigne (1990)\"."}, {"title": "B. OIDK Model", "content": "The Ermine OIDK model (see Figure 7) introduces a new component, known as the KS (Knowledge System). This component interacts with others through competence flows (which include knowledge related to knowing, knowing doing, knowing being, and others) and cognition flows (which encompass knowledge related to problem-solving, conflict resolution, best practices, creativity, and more) that are accumulated over time by the enterprise's personnel. Competence flows serve as input streams to the KS from OS, IS, and DS, while cognition flows act as output streams from the KS to OS, IS, and DS. The KS functions as a repository for knowledge assets, designed to store and capitalize on the enterprise's daily knowledge (Ermine J-L., 1996, 2008).\nThe sociotechnical approach that we propose, aligns Knowledge Management (KM) and Imperfect Knowledge Management (IKM), through the OIDK model (see Figure 7).\nKnowledge Management (KM) is the process of capitalizing on, storing, and utilizing knowledge assets (see Figure 7) by the personnel in OS, IS, and DS roles during daily business activities or within business units. KM is designed to ensure that knowledge is used effectively while preserving its integrity for future generations of employees (Jim\u00e9nez L., 2007).\nImperfect Knowledge Management (IKM) aids in managing KS competence flows or cognition flows (see Figure 7) by dealing with the imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete aspects of meaning. IKM acknowledges that an enterprise's knowledge is often imperfect, characterized by varying degrees of imprecision, uncertainty, or incompleteness. Additionally, the human aspects of ideas, emotions, and actions that contribute to the creation of new knowledge within an enterprise represent a complex system of human relationships (Jim\u00e9nez L., 2010)."}, {"title": "III. E-GENAI", "content": "Enterprise AI (e-AI) encompasses more than just data science, machine learning (ML), or large language models (LLMs). According to Enterprise-knowledge, e-Al involves addressing a well-defined business problem within a specific organizational context, utilizing reliable data, diverse skill sets, and ensuring the solution is explainable (e-AI, 2024).\nThe sociotechnical approach that we propose for the Enterprise Generative Artificial Intelligence (E-GenAI) can enhance collaboration within the Providers-Enterprise- Customers ecosystem by employing various LLMs to analyze business information in two phases. First, it utilizes GenAI- based SCM-ERP-CRM platforms. Second, it leverages GenAI-based BI-FL-TRIZ-KM-IKM platforms. Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping business reality and creating a new ecosystem. This evolution transitions from a vision of the enterprise integrating business information flows (production of products and services, the OID model) to one that incorporates business knowledge flows (production of knowledge capital (assets), the OIDK model). Ultimately, it leads to an Enterprise Generative Artificial Intelligence (E- GenAI) ecosystem based on LLMs."}, {"title": "A. LLMs", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have amazed users with their capability to generate text that is nearly indistinguishable from that written by humans (Xin X. et al., 2023). LLMs are deep neural networks trained on extensive language data using self-supervised learning methods. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and its successors, including GPT-2, GPT-3, and the latest GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have transformed the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their ability to generate high-quality and coherent text. GPT is a generative model, meaning it can autonomously generate text by predicting the next word in a given sequence.\nThus, LLMs serve as the foundation for new Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) chatbots. These AI-powered response engines, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, LLaMA, Claude 3, Grok, AlphaCode, Copy, Rephrase, Pi, Perplexity, and others, deliver accurate, reliable, and real- time answers to any query. They contribute to the creation of a new business ecosystem for B2C, B2B, and B2G organizations. For example, ChatGPT and Rephrase help generate personalized content for customer emails, creating more engaging and natural interactions. Copy, Pi, and Perplexity boost creativity and support the development of innovative products and services. AlphaCode and Copilot assist in automating repetitive task workflows."}, {"title": "B. LLMs and Social Media", "content": "Applying the sociotechnical approach to a social media platform, the social component consists of users (both individuals and enterprises). They interact with each other through likes, photos, videos, and comments. Figure 11 illustrates a graph depicting these user interactions.\nUser 3 posts a photo, User 4 likes it and adds a comment, while User 4 only leaves a like. Users can choose to view a post, like it, comment on it, or ignore it entirely (as in the case of User 1). Their actions are driven by the content of the post and their interest. This interaction model represents a complex system. Now, the technical component of the sociotechnical approach can be illustrated using an Entity Relationship Diagram (see Figure 12).\nMeanwhile, Figure 13 illustrates a relation called \"Binding\" between a User and a Followee. A User is someone who follows others, while a Followee is someone being followed. To find all followers of a specific user, the query would be SELECT User FROM Binding WHERE Followee = userID. Conversely, to find all users that a particular user follows, the query would be SELECT Followee FROM Binding WHERE User = userID.\nTo understand the dynamic of user interactions, Figure 14 (left) illustrates the relationships between Followers, Posts, and Followees. A Follower is a user who follows another, while a Followee is someone whose posts are followed by others. Figure 14 (right) presents a finite automata with two states: \"follows\" and \"followees,\" along with four transitions: {follows/follows, follows/followees, followees/followees, followees/follows}. This finite automata depicts the interactions between Followers and Followees, and recursively, the interactions between each user and their respective Followers and Followees."}, {"title": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The paper proposes a sociotechnical approach to analyze a business ecosystem of data, information, and knowledge, using Le Moigne's OID and Ermine's OIDK model. Le Moigne's OID model enables us to describe the enterprise as a living system that evolves, organizes, and structures itself through its relationships with Providers, Enterprise, and Customers via platforms like SCM, ERP, and CRM. We align with the OID model by using Fuzzy Logic (FL) to handle imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete data within the information system, Business Intelligence (BI) to achieve the strategic objectives of the decision system, and TRIZ to address complex problems within the operational system. Ermine's OIDK model incorporates a knowledge component into the OID model. We align with the OIDK model by using Knowledge Management (KM) to capitalize on knowledge assets, and Imperfect Knowledge Management (IKM) to handle the imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete aspects of competence or cognition flows.\nThe primary goal of this theoretical paper is explore an E- GenAI business ecosystem. This ecosystem integrates GenAI- based platforms for SCM, ERP, and CRM with those for BI, FL, TRIZ, KM, and IKM, in order to align Large Language Models (LLMs) within the framework of the E-GenAI (OID) model. The social media platform functions as an integrated system designed to create value through social interactions between people and enterprises. To facilitate the development of LLMs capable of identifying specific user characteristics, we have defined these interactions using finite automata.\nIn future research, we plan to utilize the E-GenAI (OID) model to examine the dynamics of LLMs within a specific business context. This will allow us to consider including case studies or empirical data that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in Real-Time Enterprise settings. We address more explicitly the limitations and challenges associated with implementing the E-GenAI (OID) model, especially concerning technological infrastructure, data privacy, and ethical considerations. We'll create a Finite Automata States and Transitions to modeling (1) Human \u2013 Machine (humans handle labeling and GenAI like ChatGPT refine these labels) for automating customer feedback classification, and (2) to modeling Followers Followees for automating user preferences on social media platforms."}]}

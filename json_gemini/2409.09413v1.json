{"title": "Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Causation between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence", "authors": ["Tadahiro Taniguchi", "Masafumi Oizumi", "Noburo Saji", "Takato Horii", "Naotsugu Tsuchiya"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel perspective on the bidirectional causation between language emergence and relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out the constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that languages with distributional semantics, e.g., syntactic-semantic structures, may have emerged through the process of aligning internal representations among individuals, and such alignment of internal representations facilitates more structured language. This mutual dependency is suggested by the recent advancements in Al and symbol emergence robotics, and collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, in particular. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional causation in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The relationship between language and qualia\u2014\u2014qualitative aspects of consciousness\u2014\u2014is an intriguing research topic (Winawer et al., 2007a; Zlatev, 2008). One of the closest contacts between the two fields has been the issue of the dependency of perception on language as studied in developmental psychology and cross-linguistic studies. For example, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Deutscher, 2010) has been tested in the context of developmental psychology and cross-linguistic studies, connecting the two fields.\nThis paper considers a related, yet distinct issue: bidirectional causation between language emergence and qualia structure (Kawakita et al., 2023a; Tsuchiya, 2024; Kleiner, 2024; Tsuchiya and Saigo, 2021; Lyre, 2022; Tallon-Baudry, 2022; Malach, 2021; Fink et al., 2021). A qualia structure is the structure of relationships between different qualia, such as the quale of red being closer to pink than to blue. This idea is mainly motivated by findings in computational studies including artificial intelligence (AI) and symbol emergence in robotics (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Huh et al., 2024; Taniguchi et al., 2016a, 2018). Neural network-based language models are known to form internal representations that hold structural relationships. Also, multimodal language models form internal representations shared by language and perceptual information. Artificial cognitive systems develop internal representations\u00b9 through a dual process: bottom-up integration of sensory-motor information and top-down incorporation of linguistic knowledge, resulting in multimodal internal representations. Language, by imposing structure on these representations, may significantly influence how sensory-motor information is organized internally. For humans, sharing language may lead to structurally similar qualia structures across individuals. Thus, language serves not just as a communication tool, but as an aligning force for subjective experiences. Harmonization of sensory-motor and linguistic information into internal representations fundamentally shapes our perception, interpretation, and interaction with the world, underscoring the profound influence of language on human cognition and conscious experience, while language itself emerges in human society on the basis of our physical and social interactions, i.e., language emergence. Although the exact relationship between qualia and neural activity in the brain (i.e., internal representations) has not yet been elucidated, in this paper we assume only that the relational structure of neural activity would correlate with the relational structure of qualia. Thus, we assume that a change in the structure of internal representations leads to a change in the structure of qualia.\nIn psychological studies, language is considered to exert some top-down influence on perceptual internal representations. It is natural to assume that speakers of the same language share internal representations to some degree, despite the private nature of their subjective perceptual experiences (i.e., the fact that one cannot directly access or experience another person's sensations, thoughts, or qualia). However, as a famous philosophical riddle of \u201cinverted qualia\u201d implies, structural relationships between language and qualia are not straightforward. Given a set of the same external stimuli, qualia for the corresponding stimuli can be consistently labeled and communicated with each other even if qualia are inverted between two persons. Thus, structural equivalence at the level of language does not guarantee that of qualia structure. One possible approach to the qualia inversion problem is to evaluate a structural similarity between individuals in an unsupervised, i.e., language-free manner, and to consider the unsupervised structural similarity as one of the necessary conditions to guarantee no qualia inversion (Kawakita et al., 2023a).\nMeanwhile, linguistic communication faces similar challenges in sharing meanings. Consider that the meaning of two words are swapped between the two persons, yet they do not notice this. This is a rather likely scenario. Yet people manage to understand each other through language thanks to the relations between words and their associated qualia, i.e., subjective (multimodal) experiences. This is related to the symbol grounding problem in cognitive science and AI (Harnad, 1990). This implies that there are underlying mechanisms in our brains, the world, and society that enable the emergence of communication and symbol systems that share structurally similar internal representations. Investigating"}, {"title": "2 EMERGENCE OF LANGUAGE AND QUALIA STRUCTURE", "content": "Qualia affects language and vice versa. Considering the phenomena of language (or symbol) emergence, (internal) representation learning, and (grounded) language acquisition, this mutual influence can be regarded as bidirectional causation. This section summarizes the perspectives on the bidirectional causation between qualia and language following the diagram shown in Figure 1.\nFirst, Figure 1 (a) shows the upward causation. We should not forget that language systems evolve on top of our brains through human biological and cultural adaptation to the environment (Deacon, 1998; Christiansen and Chater, 2023; Kirby and Hurford, 2002; Steels, 2005). We employ language as a means of adapting to our environment, enabling us to engage in the physical and social interactions necessary for thriving in our surroundings. From a developmental perspective, Piaget conventionally introduced the idea of a schema system that is structurally formed through physical interactions with an infant's environment using sensory-motor systems (Flavell, 2011). He described a dynamic view of self-organization of cognitive systems. In the context of AI and cognitive robotics, this process is represented by representation learning. On such a basis, language emerges within a society based on cognitive systems (Taniguchi et al., 2018; Taniguchi, 2024). Through representation learning, agents learn internal representations that model the"}, {"title": "2.1 Bidirectional causation between qualia and language", "content": "world's structure from multimodal perceptual information. As a result, the structure of these learned internal representations may come to reflect the structure of the world to a certain extent 2.\nConsidering that language emerges on the basis of such internal representations, the structure of language, which is encoded as distributional semantics, may reflect the world's structure as well. This is the upward causation between qualia and language. This topic is related to the emergence of language and symbol systems. Note that language (or symbol) emergence is not just in a single brain, but is performed through the interaction between many brains via semiotic interactions (see Figure 2 and the caption of Figure 1).\nSecond, Figure 1 (b) shows the downward causation. This has been a long-standing topic regarding the effect of language on thoughts and perceptions (see Section 2.2). Recent evidence obtained through a constructive approach shows that distributional semantics can reconstruct structural relationships between concepts (see Section 3.3) (e.g., Mikolov et al. (2013b)). Distributional semantics argues that a word's meaning can be determined by analyzing its statistical distribution and co-occurrence patterns with other words in large text corpora. Large language models (LLMs) exploit the nature of distributional semantics. However, to what extent the structure of language affects qualia structure in human consciousness is still a mystery.\nThird, Figure 1 (c) shows the bidirectional causation, which has not yet been investigated in the literature. The bidirectional causation is the combination of upward and downward causation. This kind of dynamic systemic view of language and internal representation has been referred to as symbol emergence systems (Taniguchi et al., 2016a, 2018). Even if one argues that language has a dominant effect on internal representations, language itself emerges in human society based on multimodal sensory-motor perceptual experiences and social interactions. This is a discussion of language and symbol emergence on embodied cognitive systems. Therefore, an important question to ask regarding the bidirectional causation is how humans could form a language that involves a structure capable of exerting such influence on qualia structure.\nIf we stand at the viewpoint of bidirectional causation, we consider that both qualia structure and language are emergent or self-organized. They are changing in a cyclic manner. So, what is the source of information for organizing structures of language and qualia? We hypothesize that one of the essential sources for both language and qualia structures is our embodied multimodal experience of the world."}, {"title": "2.2 Psychological perspectives", "content": "How has psychology addressed the issue of bidirectional causation between language and perception? Specifically, what is known about the causal effects of language on perception, and what role does perceptual experience play in shaping the structure of language?\nThe first question, often associated with the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, has attracted significant attention from psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists. Empirical studies have approached this issue with two main questions in mind: how speakers of different languages perceive the world (e.g., Berlin and Kay (1969)) and how children's perception of the world changes as they acquire their native languages (e.g., Roberson et al. (2004)). Research to date has revealed two key findings: 1) biologically based perceptual experience forms the foundation for language acquisition, and 2) individual languages exert a powerful influence on the perceptual experiences of speakers. A well-known traditional example of the 1) is"}, {"title": "2.3 Collective Predictive Coding and the Bidirectional Causation", "content": "Bidirectional causation is, generally, a characteristic feature of emergent systems\u00b3 Taniguchi et al. (2016a, 2018) argued that symbolic communication, including language, is an emergent function that is based on this type of emergent system. Specifically, they call the system a symbol emergence system. The collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis argues that language emerges through CPC (Taniguchi, 2024). \nThroughout the paper, in the CPC, w, z and o represent language, internal representations, and (perceptual) observations, respectively, following the convention of the original and related papers. This idea extends the concept of predictive coding (Hohwy, 2013) from the individual cognitive system level to the collective (social) systems level, and provides a viewpoint to formalize the symbol (language) emergence as a decentralized Bayesian inference (Hagiwara et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2023b). In other words, language as a distribution of sentences is sampled from the posterior distribution of latent variables given agents' distributed observations. This idea is closely related to the free-energy principle and world models (Friston, 2019; Parr et al., 2022; Friston et al., 2021; Taniguchi et al., 2023a).\nThe main argument of this paper is to extend the idea to the structural level. Specifically, we aim to clarify the mutual influence between the latent syntactic-semantic structure of language, i.e., distributional semantics, and the structure of perceptual internal representations Additionally, we argue that the structures of internal representations of agents are influenced and becoming similar when mediated by language"}, {"title": "2.4 Levels of qualia and language", "content": "Considering the variety of directness or abstractness in its relationship between perceptual experiences and linguistic expressions, e.g., words or sentences, we can consider that there are several levels of qualia and internal representations from the viewpoint of the relationship between language and qualia. In particular, considering building language through language games, it is highly probable that we, humans, need to have a basic representation that is structurally similar among people to a certain extent. In addition, language acts as an external representation system encoding agents' observations from the viewpoint of the CPC hypothesis."}, {"title": "3 CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH", "content": "In this paper, we propose to investigate the bidirectional causation between language and qualia structures based on a constructive approach. The basic research strategy is to train neural network models with certain learning mechanisms (e.g., CPC introduced in the previous sections) and to extract the internal representations of the neural network to external inputs. Then, we compare the structure of the internal representation of the trained models with the qualia structure of humans estimated by behavioral experiments. If we find a certain degree of sameness between the structure of the internal representations of the model and the qualia structure, we can say that this learning mechanisms used in the model could also be used in humans.\nThe goal of this constructive approach is (1) to understand which learning mechanisms can generate the internal representations that resemble human qualia structures, (2) to understand the properties of the internal structures in more detail. In the model, by systematically manipulating the learning mechanisms and the stimuli used to train and test the model, we can pursue these questions in a way that is not possible in real experiments. We should note that the goal is not to create a \u201cconscious AI\u201d. Even if we create a neural network model whose internal representation mimics the human qualia structure, this does not necessarily mean that the neural network model has consciousness and that its conscious experiences are similar to those of humans. All we can say is that the structural correspondence is one of the necessary conditions, but not a sufficient condition, for a neural network model to have conscious experiences similar to those of humans. Accordingly, this paper only proposes to use neural network models as a tool to infer the mechanisms of learning."}, {"title": "3.1 Overview", "content": "Figure 4 illustrates the structural influence in qualia and language through a probabilistic generative model representing language emergence, following the theory of CPC. (A) depicts the language-perception structural influence within an individual. The bidirectional arrows represent the mutual influence between two qualia structures, one inferred from language and the other from perception. These structures together form an integrated qualia structure influenced by both sources. (B) shows the inter-personal structural influence, demonstrating how language acts as a medium for aligning internal representations, and consequently qualia structures between individuals who share a common language system. This aspect relates to how the qualia structures of different agents might be shaped and aligned through linguistic interaction.

(2023) for a review), partly due to the recent rapid development of deep learning. In addition to the developments in machine learning, construction and public-sharing of large datasets about human behaviors make human-machine comparisons feasible and meaningful. In particular, the creative use of online cloud sourcing has generated massive behavioral datasets of unprecedented size. For example, Hebart et al. created similarity judgment datasets on 1,854 natural objects by collecting about 6,000,000 similarity judgment responses (Hebart et al., 2020), and Roads and Love created similarity judgment datasets on 50,000 images from the ILSVRC validation dataset by collecting about 400,000 similarity judgment responses (Roads and Love, 2020).

Recent empirical evidence based on constructive approaches has been accumulating, as described in the following subsections. In a way, this complements the psychological research reviewed in Section 2.2."}, {"title": "3.4 Unified framework for intra- and inter-personal structural influence", "content": "While psychological experiments can only find correlations and rarely claim causal relationships (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018), the constructive approach can, in principle, examine causal influences through explicit control and interventions. This makes the constructive approach particularly attractive in studying the complex dynamics between language emergence and qualia structure formation.\nThe constructive approach can test causal hypotheses based on models that incorporate dynamic and complex causal relationships. For upward causation , it is crucial to study constructive models that enable the emergence of distributional semantics. While neural network-based language models are known to capture structural relationships of word meanings in vector spaces by learning word distributions (see Section 3.3), it remains unclear how language emergence can create a language system with such distributional semantics.\nFor downward causation, it is important to investigate if multiple agents can learn visual representations simultaneously with learning a language model, and to examine whether the agents' internal representations become more aligned compared to conditions without language. As introduced in Section 3.3, various related studies exist, but its implications to qualia structures remain unclear at this stage.\nRegarding bidirectional causation , it is essential to construct a model that incorporates both intra- and inter-personal interactions as depicted in Figure 4. Using a constructive approach, we need to test how language emergence influences the alignment of qualia structures.\nGenerative models of emergent communication, such as Inter-GMM+VAE, have shown that even word-level naming shared through Metropolis-Hastings naming games can influence the structure of internal representations and improve the performance of perceptual stimulus modeling (Taniguchi et al., 2023b;\nHoang et al., 2024). It is important to integrate such models with language models capable of handling compositionality and syntactic structures to examine the comprehensive interdependence between language emergence and qualia structure in bidirectional causation.\nAttention should also be paid to the varying levels of qualia mentioned in Section 2.4, and the degree of dependence on language at each level. It is crucial to design and verify model-based experimental systems that can address these suggestions."}, {"title": "4 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we presented a novel perspective on the bidirectional causation between language emergence and qualia structure formation, and laid out a constructive approach for investigating this complex relationship. We proposed that language, with its syntactic-semantic structures, may have emerged through the process of aligning internal representations across individuals, and that such alignment of internal representations may, in turn, facilitate more structured language. This bidirectional causation is supported by recent advances in AI, symbol emergence robotics, and the CPC hypothesis. We explored how computational studies, particularly those involving neural network-based language models and multimodal language models, demonstrate the formation of systematically structured internal representations that can be shared between language and perceptual information.

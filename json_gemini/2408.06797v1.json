INTRODUCTION", "content": "The Sleeping Beauty problem. We follow [1, Appendix C) for the description of the\nSleeping Beauty\u00b9 problem\u00b2.\nThe Sleeping Beauty problem: Sleeping Beauty participates in an exper-\niment in which she is put to sleep on Sunday, and a fair coin is tossed.\nIf the outcome is Heads, she will be woken up on Monday only. If the\noutcome is Tails, she will be woken up on Monday and Tuesday. More\nspecifically, for outcome Tails Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday\nand put back to sleep with her memory of her awakening erased, to be\nwoken up on Tuesday again. Sleeping Beauty cannot distinguish between\nany of these awakenings. When woken up, Sleeping Beauty is asked for\nher credence that the outcome of the coin toss was Heads.\nAs a proposal to make the question a bit more clear, we may ask Sleeping Beauty,\nwhen she is woken up, the following question: 'What do you now think the outcome was,\nHeads or Tails? And what is your credence now for Heads?'\nTwo possibilities for Sleeping Beauty to answer have been debated heavily in literature.\nThe Halfers argue that 1/2 is the correct answer, the main argument being the absence of\nany new information for Beauty when she wakes up so that she should stick to her credence\n1/2 she has on Sunday, whereas the Thirders argue that 1/3 is the correct answer. Many\nworks in favour of Elga's argument for 1/3 [2], and against Lewis's 1/2 arguments of [5]\nhave appeared [2, 6-18]. The arguments for 1/2 mostly claim that no extra information\nis present for Beauty when she is woken up. Here we argue that this claim is wrong\nusing simple Bayesian probability theory and a slight extension of the protocol, with an\noutsider Prince Probability who may or may not meet Sleeping Beauty. We also consider\nthe credence of a Sleeping Beauty who knows that she is dreaming. We believe that the\nstrength of our argument is its simplicity.\nOutline. We explain our main argument using simple Bayesian probability in Section 2,\nwhere we also describe how Prince Probability updates his credence upon meeting Sleeping\nBeauty. We consider some generalisations and variations of the SB problem in Section 3.\nWe relate to Elga's argument and literature in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we comment\non the relation of the SB problem to the Frauchiger-Renner paradox [19], following [1]."}, {"title": "2. A THIRDER'S TALE OF BEAUTY AND THE PRINCE", "content": "In this section we will argue how Sleeping Beauty knowing that she is awake is nontrivial\nuseful information for Sleeping Beauty, leading to the Thirder position. First, we consider\nBeauty's point of view, but perhaps most convincing is the story including an outsider\nPrince Probability, who may or may not meet Beauty and updates his credence in Heads\naccordingly, which we discuss subsequently. Finally, we argue what credence Beauty would\nassign if she knew she were dreaming (and thus asleep), the same credence that Prince\nwould assign upon meeting a sleeping Sleeping Beauty.\nBeauty knowing that she is awake is nontrivial information. In the Sleeping\nBeauty protocol, Beauty is asked to give her credence for Heads when being woken up.\nImportantly, here the fact that Beauty is awake is nontrivial: she could have been in a\nstate of sleep too. Suppose for example that each time Beauty is woken up she is awake\nfor 1 hour. The event of her being awake under Heads then has probability\n$p(SB awake|H) = p(SB awake Monday|H) = 1/(2 \u00b7 24) = 1/48,$\n\nas she is awake for 1 hour only in the two days (48 hours) of the experiment. On the\nother hand, under Tails we have\n$p(SB awake|T) = p(SB awake Monday|T) + p(SB awake / Tuesday|T)\n= 1/48 + 1/48 = 1/24.$\nThe probability of Beauty being awake is thus\n$p(SB awake) = p(H)p(SB awake|H)+p(T)p(SB awake T) = 1/2*1/48 + 1/2*1/24 = 3/48$\nTherefore, the credence Beauty gives to Heads while being awake is\n$p(H|SB awake) = {p(H)p(SB awake|H)}/{p(SB awake)} = {1/2*1/48}/{3/48} = 1/3$.\nAnalogously, we find that p(T|SB awake) = 2/3. Thus indeed, while being awake Sleeping\nBeauty gives credence 1/3 to Heads, using the fact that she is awake, because she is more\nlikely to be awake when the outcome is Heads.\nRemark 1 (Generalisation to N days and arbitrary 'awake' time of Sleeping Beauty.). We\ncan generalise this argument to any time span Beauty is awake for when woken up before\nbeing put to sleep again, and the experiment taking any number N of days. Namely,\nconsider the variation where for Tails Beauty is woken up for N consecutive days, whereas\nfor Heads only once in those N days. Furthermore, each time she is woken up, Beauty is\nawake for z hours that day. Then, for outcome Tails as Beauty is woken up N consecutive\ndays we have P(SB awake T) = (N\u00b7z)/(24\u00b7 N) = x, where x = z/24. For Heads she\nis woken up only once during those N days, so P(SB awake H) = (1\u00b7z)/(N\u00b724) = x/N.\nTherefore,\n$P(SB awake) = p(H)p(SB awake|H) + p(T)p(SB awake T)\n= 1/2 x/N + 1/2*x = x*1/2*({N+1}/{N})$,\nand so\n$P(H|SB awake) = {P(SB awake H)p(H)}/{p(SB awake)} = {1/2*x/N}/{1/2*x*({N+1}/{N})} = 1/{N+1}$,\nand\n$P(T|SB awake) = {P(SB awake T)p(T)}/{p(SB awake)} = {1/2*x}/{1/2*x*({N+1}/{N})} = {N}/{N+1}.$\nThus, if the experiment takes N days, when woken up and asked for her belief in Heads,\nBeauty replies having credence 1/(N + 1) for Heads. For example, if N = 9, i.e. for Tails\nBeauty is woken up 9 consecutive days, each time she is woken up SB gives credence 1/10\nto Heads. As expected, this result is thus indeed independent of x, i.e., independent of\nthe time Beauty is awake for each time she is woken up. (There is of course the restriction\nx < 1 that Beauty cannot be awake for a full day or more each time she is woken up.)\nPerspective of outsider Prince Probability. Consider an outsider, Prince Probabil-ity, and for concreteness let Sleeping Beauty always reside in a sealed lab. When not\npartaking in the protocol, Prince Probability assigns credence 1/2 to Tails. Prince Prob-ability has no idea of which day it is, and Prince Probability visits Beauty's lab. He\nsees Beauty either asleep or awake. If Prince Probability sees Beauty being awake, he\nwill lower his credence to 1/3 for Heads because under Tails she is awake for more time.\nThe calculation is analogous to the one right above in eq. (4). Upon meeting the Prince,\nBeauty does not seem to get any relevant information for Heads versus Tails, suggesting\nthat she should indeed always assign credence 1/3 to Heads when she is awake. We have\nsketched this protocol in Figure 1."}, {"title": "3. VARIATIONS OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY PROBLEM", "content": "In this section we discuss two variations of the SB problem, namely the copy-SB problem\nof [1] and the case of an unfair coin toss. We have already discussed the case of many\nawakenings above in eq. (6).\n3.1. The copy Sleeping Beauty version of [1]. We now discuss a slightly altered\nversion of the copy-SB version of [1], which has a resolution similar to the one we proposed\nabove in Section 2 for the original SB problem.\nThe copy SB protocol. There are two identical sealed labs, indistinguisable from the\noutside and inside. Sleeping Beauty resides in one of those labs. A fair coin is tossed,\nwith the outcome not revealed to Sleeping Beauty. If the outcome is Tails, a copy of\nSleeping Beauty is made and put in the second lab, so that in that case both labs contain\na Sleeping Beauty. Again Sleeping Beauty knows the protocol. Each version of Sleeping\nBeauty is asked whether she thinks the outcome of the coin toss was Heads or Tails, and\nwhat her credence for Heads is. We will consider again the perspective of an outsider\nPrince Probability. All Prince Probability knows is the protocol: he does not know the\noutcome of the coin toss, whether both labs contain a Sleeping Beauty or only one, which\none contains a Sleeping Beauty, ...\nProposed resolution of the copy-SB problem. We will argue that if SB is woken\nup and being asked which outcome the coin toss had, she would assign 1/3 probability\nfor Heads. An outsider, Prince Probability, who does not know the outcome of the coin\ntoss, gives credence 1/2 to Heads prior to any action he undertakes. But when he meets\na SB, he changes his credence to 1/3 for Tails. Therefore, when Prince Probability and\nBeauty meet, they agree on their probability assignments for Heads, namely 1/3. Before\nthey have met, however, Prince Probability and Beauty can each correctly assign different\ncredences to Heads, namely 1/2 by Prince Probability and 1/3 by Beauty.\nPrince Probability's point of view. The probability that opening a lab Prince Prob-ability finds Beauty is\n$p(PP finds SB) = p(H)p(PP finds SB|T) + p(H)p(PP finds SB|H)\n= 1/2 * 1 + 1/2*1/2=3/4$\nwhere 'PP finds SB' means the event of Prince Probability finding Sleeping Beauty upon\nopening the door of a lab. The probability of Prince Probability finding a Beauty upon\nopening the door of a lab under outcome Heads (which we refer to as finding a Heads SB)\nis\n$p(PP finds Heads SB) = p(T)p (PP finds Heads SB|T) + p(H)p(PP finds Heads SB|H)\n= 1/2*1/2 + 0*1/2 =1/4.$\nTherefore, if Prince Probability finds a Sleeping Beauty, the probability that she is a Heads\nSB (meaning the outcome of the coin toss was Heads) is equal to\n$p(PP finds Heads SB | PP finds SB) = {1/4}/{3/4} = 1/3$\nInterpretation of 1/2 vs 1/3: Prince Probability's point of view. What does it\nmean that if Prince Probability finds a Beauty, the probability that she is a Heads Beauty\nis 1/3? Well, before Prince Probability enters a lab, he argues that the probability for\nHeads is 1/2. But, when he enters a lab, then he changes his credence in Heads, depending\non whether or not there is a Beauty. Namely, if he finds a Beauty, his credence in Heads\nbecomes 1/3. This is not surprising: Prince Probability has gotten new information,\nnamely that he sees a Beauty. For outcome Tails he is more likely to find a Beauty. Thus,\nconditioned on Prince Probability finding a Beauty, he gives credence 1/3 to Heads. Still,\nPrince Probability assigns probability 1/2 to Heads before he undertakes any action.\nWhat if Prince Probability finds no Sleeping Beauty? If there are only two labs\nand if Prince Probability opens a lab and finds no Beauty, he will know the outcome was\nHeads for sure. If there were additional empty labs (so under Tails only still two labs\ncontain a Beauty), then Prince Probability will have credence higher than 1/2 but less\nthan 1 that the outcome was Heads, as he is more likely to find no Beauty if the outcome"}, {"title": "4. RELATION TO LITERATURE ON SLEEPING BEAUTY", "content": "Elga's argument using the Principle of Indifference for self-locating belief leads to the\nsame conclusion as ours in Section 2, namely that Sleeping Beauty should assign credence\n1/3 to Heads when woken up [2]. Furthermore, also in all variations considered of the\nprotocol, such as an unfair coin toss and many awakenings, Elga's resolution method\ngives the same answer as ours, and accords with the updating of the outsider Prince\nProbability's point of view when meeting a Sleeping Beauty who is awake. We can see\nthis fact as an argument for the correctness of Elga's reasoning.\nAfter repeating Elga's argument and showing how it agrees with our arguments, we\nbriefly discuss what arguments on the Sleeping Beauty problem have been given in lit-erature, and counter some of the prominent Halfer arguments. We will not be able to\nmention all relevant results that have been produced about the Sleeping Beauty problem,\nfor which we apologise, but we aim to provide a short overview.\n4.1. Elga's argument for 1/3 and the Principle of Indifference. Elga [2] uses the\nPrinciple of Indifference for self-locating belief (see also [6]) to argue that the correct\nanswer for Sleeping Beauty to give when woken up is 1/3. We briefly summarise Elga's\nargument here, following his writings in [2] very closely.\nIf Sleeping Beauty is woken up, she knows she is in one of three events:\nH1: Heads and Monday,\nT1: Tails and Monday,\nT2: Tails and Tuesday.\nNamely, upon awakening, Sleeping Beauty clearly assigns zero probability to H2, i.e. the\noutcome being Heads and it being Tuesday. So T= (T\u2081 or T2), H = (H\u2081 or H2) and\nP(H) = P(H1).\nElga continues as follows:\n'Notice that the difference between your being in T\u2081 and your being in\nT2 is not a difference in which possible world is actual, but rather a dif-ference in your temporal location within the world. (In a more technical\ntreatment we might adopt a framework similar to the one suggested in\nLewis 1983, according to which the elementary alternatives over which\nyour credence is divided are not possible worlds, but rather centered pos-sible worlds: possible worlds each of which is equipped with a designated\nindividual and time. In such a framework, H1, T1, and T2 would be rep-resented by appropriate sets of centered worlds.' (quoted literally from\n[2])\nMore precisely, in [6] Elga states the Principle of Indifference for self-locating belief as\nfollows (copied from [6]):\nPRINCIPLE OF INDIFFERENCE: Similar centered worlds deserve equal cre-dence.\nElga's resolution then proceeds by arguing that P(T1) = P(T2) and P(T1) = P(H1).\nIf, when woken up, Sleeping Beauty would be told that the outcome was Tails, she\nwould know she is either in the event T\u2081 or T2. Subjectively, Sleeping Beauty cannot\ndistinguish between T\u2081 and T2, and all the same propositions are True for Sleeping Beauty\nwhether Sleeping Beauty is in T\u2081 or T2. Namely, given Tails, T\u2081 and T2 take place in\nsimilar centered worlds, so by the Principle of Indifference for self-locating belief we have\nP(T1 |T1 or T2) = P(T2|T1 or T2).\nAlternatively to the Sleeping Beauty problem where the coin is flipped first on Sunday,\nwe could also imagine the protocol where Sleeping Beauty is woken up on Monday and then\na coin is flipped determining whether Sleeping Beauty is also woken up on Tuesday (Tails)\nor not (Heads). Elga argues that in both cases, if Sleeping Beauty were told that it is\nMonday, she must assign the same credence to Heads, namely 1/2, i.e. P(H1 |H1 or T\u2081) =\n1/2, leading to P(H1) = P(T1).\nThus, using P(T1) = P(T2) and P(H1) = P(T1) together with the normalisation\nP(T1)+P(T2)+P(H1) = 1, we obtain that indeed P(H) = P(H1) = 1/3. Elga thus argues\nthat when woken up Sleeping Beauty should give credence 1/3 to Heads, in agreement\nwith our resolution.\nImportantly, the Principle of Indifference does not allow you to argue that, as T1, T2, H1\nare all subjectively indistinguishable, they should all get equal credence 1/3. For example,\nin the case of an unfair coin toss, Elga's argument will correctly divert from credence 1/3\nfor Heads. For example, if the unfair coin toss gives Heads with probability h = 1/4,\nand Tails with probability 1h = 3/4, then Elga's argument goes as follows. Still, T\u2081\nand T2 take place in similar centered worlds, so P(T1) = P(T2). Suppose it is Monday,\nso we condition on the event H1 or T1 (SB waking up on Monday). Then, by the same\nargument as above, we could also take the coin to be tossed after Sleeping Beauty waking\nup on Monday and being put back to sleep, for which then Heads has probability h = 1/4.\nSo P(H1 |H1 or T\u2081) = h, giving P(H1) = hP(H1) +hP(T1), and thus P(H1) = h/(1-\nh)P(T1). Combining this with P(T1) = P(T2) and the normalisation P(H1) + P(T1) +\nP(T2) = 1, we obtain, for example for h = 1/4, that P(H1) = 1/7. So, in the case of this\nunfair coin toss, Sleeping Beauty replies giving credence 1/7 to Heads upon being woken\nup. This accords with our resolution of Section 2 and our calculation of the unfair coin\ntoss in Section 3.2.\nIt is easy to verify that also in the general case of N awakenings and an unfair coin\ntoss with P(H) = h, Elga's resolution accords with ours, namely\n$P(H|SB awake) = 1/{N*(1-h)/h + 1}.$\nAs noted by Elga himself using an entertaining story involving Dr Evil [6], a con-sequence of the Principle of Indifference that seems somewhat unsettling is the fact that it\nfavors situations where there are many duplicates of ourselves, see also [20]. Similar diffi-culties arise when applying the Principle of Indifference to the many-worlds interpretation"}, {"title": "5. THE SLEEPING BEAUTY PROBLEM AND THE FRAUCHIGER-RENNER PARADOX", "content": "The Frauchiger-Renner (FR) paradox [19] suggests an inconsistency in the naive use\nof quantum theory to describe the use of itself. In the protocol, agents model each other\nquantumly and reason about each other's knowledge, arriving at a contradiction. The\nFrauchiger-Renner paradox makes use of a Consistency assumption (C), which can be\nparaphrased as (copied from [27]):\n(C): If an agent B knows that statement s\u2081 is true from reasoning with\na theory that an agent A accepts and A knows about this reasoning of B\nabout s1, then s\u2081 is true for agent A as well.\nThe extension of the SB problem we provided, with 1/3 and 1/2 being the correct cre-dences for Sleeping Beauty and an outsider Prince Probability (before meeting SB), re-spectively, gives an argument against Frauchiger-Renner's assumption (C), as it violates\nthe probabilistic extension thereof [1]. However, this does not resolve the stronger GHZ-FR paradox of [27] that is similar to the FR one, but makes use of a weaker Consistency\nassumption where only classically communicating classical agents (who may physically\nmeet and greet each other if desired) need to agree on statements. This assumption is not\nviolated in the SB problem or its extension, as indeed Sleeping Beauty and the outsider\nPrince Probability agree when they meet each other. This suggests that these FR-like\nparadoxes in quantum theory need a more radical resolution rather than refuting the\nConsistency assumption (C)."}, {"title": "6.

While questions of identity on the textual Internet have been thoroughly explored,\nthe Internet has progressed to a multimedia form that not only centers the visual, but specifically\nthe face. At the same time, a wealth of scholarship has and continues to center the topics of\nsurveillance and control through facial recognition technologies (FRTs), which have extended the\nlogics of the racist pseudoscience of physiognomy. Much less work has been devoted to\nunderstanding how such face-based artificial intelligence technologies have influenced the\nformation and performance of identity. This literature review considers how such technologies\ninteract with faciality, which entails the construction of what a face may represent or signify,\nalong axes of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality. In grappling with recent advances in\nAI such as image generation and deepfakes, I propose that we are now in an era of \"post-facial\"\ntechnologies that build off our existing culture of facility while eschewing the analog face,\ncomplicating our relationship with identity vis-\u00e1-vis the face. Drawing from previous\nframeworks of identity play in the digital, as well as trans practices that have historically played\nwith or transgressed the boundaries of identity classification, we can develop concepts adequate\nfor analyzing digital faciality and identity given the current landscape of post-facial artificial\nintelligence technologies that allow users to interface with the digital in an entirely novel\nmanner. To ground this framework of transgression, I conclude by proposing an interview study\nwith VTubers online streamers who perform using motion-captured avatars instead of their\nreal-life faces to gain qualitative insight on the experience and perceptions of users of\npost-facial technologies and how these sociotechnical experiences interface with our\nrelationships with identity and the digital anew.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "\u201cAny system for representing the face tells us something about the society and historical\nmoment that produced it.\u201d \u2013 Kelly Gates, Our Biometric Future [16]\nWhat's in a face?\nIn Digitizing Race, Lisa Nakamura [37] introduces the case study of the early 2000's website,\nalllooksame.com, which asks its visitors to attempt to distinguish Chinese, Japanese, and Korean\nindividuals by pictures of their faces.

We can read previous scholarship on the multiplicity and performance\nof identity from Turkle, Kendall, and Nakamura anew in this post-facial age. For example,\nbecause VTubing and deepfakes allow for individuals to perform faces that are completely\ndistinct from their own, I argue that this allows for a return to the possibility of identity tourism\nonce more. Whereas previous facial technologies such as facial recognition worked to affix\nidentity onto facial characteristics, and individuals were rendered visible on the visual Internet by\nway of webcams, post-facial technologies allow us to navigate digital spaces while possibly\nembodying wholly different identities, just as the textual did.\nBut just as with FRTs, we still run into the same logics of physiognomy with post-facial\ntechnologies. If we consider that we can perform specific identities through deepfakes or\nconstruct specific identities through generative AI, this is still rooted in the belief that identity\nand the face are still inextricably connected, that the face does correlate or correspond to innate\nidentity characteristics. Though we might be subverting the primacy of the analog face, we still\nplace value in how the face informs our perceptions about identity. As post-facial technologies\nare not simply a complete departure from a culture of faciality, it can be argued that they are still\ntechnologies built from physiognomic logics. Perhaps just as Audre Lorde [32] said, this is a\ncase where \u201cthe master's tools will never dismantle the master's house,\u201d that though post-facial\ntechnologies may challenge, disrupt, or complicate how identity is constructed in the digital, it is\nstill not liberatory enough.\nHowever, this is not to say that post-facial technologies do not have any influence on how we\ncome to understand, perform, and form identity in the digital. For those who utilize post-facial\ntechnologies, I am curious about the lived experience that comes with it, such as the possible joy\nthat trans VTubers gain in being perceived as a gender that is more in line with their own. At the\nsame time, we return to the same complications of identity tourism as described by Nakamura in\nthe textual internet, specifically that of racial fetishization. Because VTubing draws from\nJapanese aesthetics and \u201ckawaii\u201d culture, it has raised the question of digital yellowface, an\nemerging term that first appeared in response to a variety of Snapchat filters that gave users\nstereotypical and/or caricatured Asian facial features. With VTubing, the race of the streamer\ncannot be visually inferred, since the virtual avatar acts as proxy for the appearance of the\nperformer. As opposed to the textual internet where Whiteness is seen as default, Asianness is\nthe assumed default in the landscape of VTubing. Behind the anonymity of their virtual avatar\nand the assumed Asianness, some VTubers have adopted stereotypically Japanese pseudonyms\n(with backlash from fans and peers), often performing a form of Asianness through the inclusion\nof mimicked Japanese phrases (e.g., \u201cKonichiwa Bitches\u201d and ending sentences in \u201c-desu\u201d), even\nwhen it is later revealed that these streamers are White and not in fact Japanese.

Within\ndigital faciality culture, trans practices have worked to challenge or complicate the project of\nclassification from technologies of faciality, such as physiognomic AI. This subversion is not\nnew. It is no coincidence that many of the studies and projects that challenge the culture of an\n\u201cobjective\u201d faciality, reviewed throughout this paper, have been produced by queer/trans scholars\nand artists. As scholars such as Legacy Russell and Whit Pow argue, trans folks have always\nexisted as \"glitches\u201d to these systems of capture and classification, and this characteristic of the\nglitch has given us the opportunity for liberation [43, 47]. Glitches can be understood as a\n\u201cdisruptive and deconstructive act within a computational system,\u201d one that interrupts how the\ndigital mediates classification, visuality, and embodiment. Along these lines, post-facial\ntechnologies can be utilized as an extension of queer and trans embodiment, one that\ntransgresses against the identity categories reified by FRTs. Perhaps the post-facial can even\nbecome a transgression of faciality itself, challenging the very aspects of identity that we attempt\nto infer from the face.\nSince post-facial technologies such as VTubing and deepfakes allow for play with one's identity,\nthey can perhaps be considered \u201ctrans technologies,\u201d a term coined by Oliver Haimson [18], who\nidentifies technologies that allow for \u201cthe queer aspects of multiplicity, fluidity, and ambiguity\nneeded for transition.\u201d Just as with early Tumblr, post-facial technologies such as VTubing\nand deepfakes in general allow trans users to \u201csafely experiment and explore their gender\nexpression.", "identity realness\" to themselves, without fear of their real-life\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Proposed Study: Interviewing VTubers\",\n      \"content\": \"To examine the impact of face-based \u201cpost-facial": "I technologies and the possibility of\ntransgressions, I propose to study VTubers, who currently utilize post-facial technologies to\nperform particular instantiations of identity in the digital. As VTubing has become an\nincreasingly popular modality for online streamers, especially queer and trans streamers of color,\nit should no longer be considered a niche digital practice. For example, the disabled Latina\nAmerican VTuber Ironmouse became the most subscribed account on the streaming platform\nTwitch in February 2022, notably becoming the first female streamer to gain that status. In\nSeptember 2024, Ironmouse would once again reclaim the title as the most subscribed Twitch\nstreamer, reinvigorating conversations around the popularity and affordances of VTubing for\ntraditionally marginalized streamers.\nDespite the prominence and cultural impact of VTubing today, nearly no attention has been given\nto VTubers in digital and media studies, even by those studying streamer culture. This study is\nmotivated by a desire to better understand how VTubers conceptualize their identity as they use\nthis technology, and what affordances it provides in performing identity.\nJust as the textual web allowed trans individuals to fully be seen in the way they desired, the\naffordances of VTubing allow for safer, liberatory possibilities in the current era of online\nvisuality and digital faciality culture. For disabled VTubers like Ironmouse, it allows them to\npresent in ways that can bring attention to their disabilities, while giving them an accessible\ntechnology that materially enables them to stream. It is also important to recognize that VTubing\nis an international phenomenon, not localized to Japan nor the United States, with countries such\nas Indonesia having thriving VTuber communities as well. Given the pseudo/anonymity of\nVTubing, Indonesian streamers such as Hana Macchia are able to more safely present their queer\nidentities under the protection of VTubing, especially against the backdrop of growing anti-queer\nsentiments in Indonesia [62], without fear of backlash or harm to their real, analog selves.\nFurthermore, VTubing has also allowed for streamers to better embody non-binary and even\nnon-human identities, with VTubers such as Ying (\u83ba) designing their virtual avatar to\nspecifically appear androgynous and Fuwa performing with a frog avatar.\nHowever, the popularly Japanese or anime aesthetic of VTuber avatars cannot be ignored. While\nVTubing might enable the transgression of gender categories and the inference of gender from\nthe face, the default Asianness and possible aesthetic fetishism of VTubing must be scrutinized.\nIn using this post-facial technology, it is pertinent to inspect how VTubers conceptualize race as\nwell as gender and sexuality as it is performed through the face. While VTubers like Artemis the\nBlue play with their gender using this technology, questions remain about how the eschewing of\nthe face simultaneously allows them to embody a racial identity that they might not hold beyond\nthe digital. Because of the multifaceted and nuanced nature of VTubing, it serves as a potent\nobject of study for an intersectional analysis of digital faciality culture as mediated by face-based\nAI technologies. For these reasons, I am curious about how the technology of VTubing has\nshifted streamers' perception of what aspects of identity we can infer from the face, and how this\nplay and performance informs the experiences of VTubers (if at all)."}, {"title": "Proposed Research Methods", "content": "In order to carry out this study, I propose the empirical qualitative approach of conducting\nsemi-structured interviews, each an hour in duration, with roughly 20-25 VTuber participants.\nThe goal of these semi-structured interviews is to understand the various experiences of these\nVTubers, particularly in reference to how they conceptualize and perform their identity through\nthe use of VTubing as opposed to analog streaming. The VTubers who will be interview\nparticipants will be recruited through a purposive sample from my (quite large) existing network\nof VTubers, as well as using snowball sampling based on recommendations from those who have\nbeen interviewed. Interviews will then be analyzed using thematic analysis, with iterative coding\nthrough the development of a codebook with another coder in order to achieve adequate\nintercoder reliability.\nThe goal is to study how VTubers construct and perform with the face, as a particular case study\nthinking about digital faciality culture today. While VTubing provides room for identity play and\nvaried embodied performance, which may be liberatory in terms of playing with gender, there\nmay be further complications with playing with race, even when unintentional, especially as\nVTubing has already been implicated with cultural appropriation and aesthetic fetishism due to\nits roots in Japanese culture. By taking on the general population of VTubers more broadly, as\nopposed to starting with a specific subpopulation of VTubers, I treat this as an exploratory study\nthat can lead to future directions of research that may not be conspicuous just yet. I hope to look\nat a broad spectrum of possible topics, including perceptions of gender and race, privacy and\nsafety concerns, and elements of play and joy for a diverse set of participants.\nPossible interview questions might include: Why stream with a VTuber avatar rather than with\nthe analog face? What do you think about the identity that your VTuber model conveys to\naudiences? Has VTubing allowed you to embody a digital identity that you might perceive as\ndistinct from your analog identity?\nMy hope is that this work may serve as a foundation for future research with VTubers, which\nwould focus on specific facets of VTubing in different contexts. For example, this study would\nsupplement ongoing work focusing specifically on trans VTubers led by Hibby Thach that I am\nsupporting on, analyzing the liberatory possibilities and affordances of VTubing for trans\nstreamers.

Face-based\nartificial intelligence technologies did not emerge on their own, removed from the sociopolitical\ncontext within which they materially and discursively exist. They are products of digital faciality\nculture, rooted in the physiognomic belief that faces signify essential qualities of the bodies to\nwhich they belong. At the same time, they influence our belief that sophisticated enough\ntechnologies can accurately reduce identity to a particular subset of facial features, forming a\nfeedback loop to inform our digital faciality culture. It is in this sense that face-based artificial\nintelligence technologies play a crucial role in the process of both face-making and identity\nformation vis-\u00e0-vis the face.\nThis literature review traces the instances in which face-based artificial intelligence technologies\nhave interacted with digital faciality culture. Facial recognition technologies, including facial\nanalysis and automatic gender recognition, have been developed in attempts to infer race, gender,\nand sexuality from the face, yet have largely been analyzed with respect to questions of\nsurveillance, bias, and fairness.

As such, we have yet to contend seriously with\nthe question of faciality in the era of post-facial technologies, beyond the notion that the logics\nthat drive these technologies may lie in racist, pseudoscientific origins. Yet, as seen with trans\nusers' engagement with automated gender recognition systems and VTubing, face-based\nartificial intelligence technologies have the potential to encourage play with the face and shift\nnotions of what a face signifies.\nIn this paper, I propose one possible framework to understand this play as a sort of transgression\nof the categorizing logics of the past. Post-facial technologies have reshaped the landscape of\ndigital faciality culture by allowing us to generate faces that are not our own, and embody them\nin the digital as if they were. Will we as a society come to understand identity with respect to the\nface differently in the years to come as a result of these post-facial technologies and their\npossibilities for transgression? Or will we simply continue to reproduce the logics of\nphysiognomy and visual subjugation along the same old contours of power and oppression?\nWhile inspecting the possibly transformative experiences of those who practice VTubing, there\nremain so many more applications of post-facial technologies to consider and study. One such\nexample is the role that they play in media beyond the Internet, such as in television and film\nwhere deepfakes revive actors of the past in franchises like Star Wars and Alien. Another\ndimension to consider is how post-facial technologies can possibly transform the nature of labor,\nespecially at a time when corporations and public services alike have turned to introducing\nVTuber mascots to personify their brands. This is not to mention the impact that post-facial\ntechnologies have on sex work and the visuality of adult content, which has not only been a\ncentral focus when discussing deepfakes, but also one of the earliest use cases of VTubing.\nThough I began with questions of identity as tied to face-based artificial intelligence\ntechnologies, I now find myself questioning the sorts of transgressive possibilities that these\ntechnologies can offer us, across the boundaries of race, gender, sexuality, disability, and\nultimately faciality itself.

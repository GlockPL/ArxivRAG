In some cases, data from numerical simulations or experiments can also be used\nto help train the network.

Algorithms of physics-informed data-driven (PIDD) initialization of a neural\nnetwork and gradient-free neuron-by-neuron (NbN) fitting method for neural networks with one hidden layer and\nrectified sigmoid function have been proposed. The results show that the accuracy of the ODE solutions which is\nprovided by neural networks with a rectified sigmoid activation function outperforms the accuracy of the ODE solution\nwhich is provided by neural networks with a sigmoid activation function. This superiority is observed for the neural\nnetworks both after PIDD initialization and NbN training, for linear, nonlinear, and chaotic problems. Using the\nexample of a harmonic oscillator, it is shown that the accuracy of solving the ODE using a neural network with such an\nactivation function as a rectified sigmoid is close in values to standard numerical solvers.

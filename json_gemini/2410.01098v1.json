Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a pivotal tool in transforming the building sector. This underscores the urgency and potential for integrating Generative AI, refers to computational techniques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content [2], across building systems to catalyze advancements in energy management [3]. Generative Al has been successfully applied in areas like Code Copilot [4], translation [5], and game computer graphics [6], due to its ability to generate context-aware, high-quality outputs with minimal human input. Compared to traditional methods, it excels in automating complex tasks, improving accuracy, and significantly enhancing both speed and scalability in processes like coding, language translation, and graphical design. Thus, Generative AI can also play a critical role in building industry, including building design [7], construction [8], and operation [9]. The intricate mesh of design specifications, graphical data, and regulatory requirements provides a fertile ground for Generative AI applications that can streamline processes, optimize material use, and ensure compliance with stringent safety and construction standards. However, these challenges include the availability of robust datasets to train AI models, the accuracy and sensitivity of AI systems, and the alignment of these technologies with evolving energy efficiency assessments [10,11] The present study aims to thoroughly examine the existing applications of Generative AI in the building industry, identifying both the strides and gaps in current research.

Unlike LSTMs that process data sequentially, transformers process entire sequences of data simultaneously [16]. This parallel processing capability reduces training time, making transformers particularly efficient for handling large datasets. This efficiency has led to their widespread adoption in training models on extensive text corpora such as the Wikipedia database and the Common Crawl dataset [17]. Developing a machine learning model, including those based on transformers, is typically an iterative process where a data scientist might experiment with dozens to hundreds of model versions to achieve a model that satisfies predefined criteria [18]. A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of Generative AI model, built upon transformer architecture, specifically designed to handle a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, language understanding, and classification [19], like GPT-40 [20]. As a widely-used example of Generative AI, LLMs are known for their ability to generate human-like text, making them integral to applications such as chatbots, text-to-image tools, and other AI-driven content creation technologies [21]. While LLMs offer promising enhancements in efficiency and decision-making within the building sector, their deployment must be carefully managed to address challenges related to data quality, security, and domain-specific requirements [22]. A Small Language Model (SLM) is a more resource-efficient alternative to LLMs, designed with significantly fewer parameters. SLMs excel in efficiency, requiring less computational power and producing a lower carbon footprint, making them more accessible to researchers and developers with limited resources [23]. However, they tend to underperform in complex tasks compared to LLMs, which can process longer sequences and capture intricate contextual relationships more effectively [23]. While SLMs offer a balance between performance and efficiency, they may fall short in scenarios requiring deep language understanding or few-shot learning."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Diffusion model", "content": "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that create data, such as images or text, by simulating a process that gradually transforms noise into meaningful content [24], like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E [25]. They work by first adding noise to the data in a forward process and then learning to reverse this process, effectively denoising the data to generate new, realistic samples. As a fundamental framework in Generative AI, diffusion models operate via this two-step process, where the forward diffusion transforms data into noise and the reverse process, guided by a neural network, reconstructs the data from noise [26]. These models have gained prominence in generating high-quality images by refining random noise into detailed and coherent outputs, surpassing traditional models like GANs and VAEs in stability and quality. However, diffusion models often require longer sampling times due to their iterative denoising process, making them computationally intensive [26]. Despite this, their ability to produce high-quality results across multiple domains, including image synthesis, text generation, and audio processing, makes them a powerful and versatile tool in generative AI."}, {"title": "2.2 Current Models and Platforms", "content": "In recent years, significant advancements in Al have given rise to highly sophisticated models capable of generating images, videos, and text.

Additionally, platforms like Runway [32] offer user- friendly interfaces where creators can experiment with video generation without needing deep technical knowledge."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Text Generation Models", "content": "Text generation models have advanced significantly, with prominent examples including OpenAI's GPT-4 [33], Google's Gemini [34], and Meta's LLaMA [35]. These models leverage transformer architectures to produce coherent and contextually relevant text, making them invaluable for various applications such as chatbots, content creation, and more. Notably, models like LLaMA and Google's Gemini are available as open-source projects, allowing users to download and run them locally, providing flexibility for a wide range of use cases. One of the most significant advancements in text generation is the adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that greatly enhances the capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources during the generation process [36]. Unlike traditional text Generation models, which rely solely on the pre-trained knowledge encoded within the model, RAG retrieves relevant information from indexed content to supplement the model's responses [37]. This approach allows for the generation of text that is not only more accurate but also more contextually relevant, as it incorporates up- to-date or domain-specific information that the model may not have encountered during its initial training. RAG is versatile and can be applied to both SLMs and LLMs. By enabling these models to dynamically retrieve and utilize external data, RAG significantly improves their performance, making them particularly valuable in scenarios where the context, accuracy, and timeliness of information are critical [37]."}, {"title": "2.3 Access and Utilization", "content": "There are several ways to access and utilize these advanced Al models, which can be broadly grouped into open and non-open solutions. Open-source models, such as Meta's LLaMA and Google's upcoming Gemini 2, can be downloaded and deployed locally, offering users full control over their AI capabilities. On the other hand, non-open platforms like Hugging Face and Azure Portal provide hosted environments where users can interact with models without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure. Utilization can also be categorized based on the application type (or user-interface type). For instance, AI models can be integrated into chatbot development, as seen with GPT-based chatbots, or used within web portals like the Azure Portal, which allows for real-time interaction and model testing. Additionally, tools like GitHub Copilot leverage AI for code generation and assistance, while API access, such as through the OpenAI API, enables developers to seamlessly incorporate AI functionalities into their applications and workflows. These diverse options allow users to choose the best approach for their specific needs, whether they prioritize control, ease of use, or integration capabilities."}, {"title": "2.4 Common techniques for customizing models", "content": "In the field of generative AI, particularly in the deployment and optimization of LLMs, several techniques stand out: prompt engineering, RAG and embedding, fine-tuning, and continued pre-training (CPT), arranged in order of increasing complexity, quality, cost, and time. All play crucial roles in enhancing the performance and applicability of AI models across various domains and tasks. Prompt Engineering Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing, crafting, and refining inputs or prompts to optimize the responses of generative AI models, which are LLMs based on NLP [42]. The quality and structure of prompts are critical in guiding these models to produce meaningful, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs. In the realm of generative AI, especially in educational applications, prompt engineering becomes an essential skill that enables effective communication between humans and AI. Generative Al's capabilities are vast, mimicking human language and comprehension, but the effectiveness of its responses largely depends on the quality of the prompts it receives. Well-crafted prompts can unlock the full potential of AI models, while poorly designed ones may lead to irrelevant or nonsensical outputs. This makes prompt engineering crucial, as it influences how the AI interprets tasks, ensures clarity in communication, and helps guide the AI toward desired outcomes [43] In practical terms, prompt engineering has a direct impact on generative AI performance. By refining prompts to be clear, concise, and contextually rich, the AI can better understand the task and generate content that aligns with the user's needs. This optimization can be iterative, where prompts are tested,"}, {"title": "2.5 Summary", "content": "The current landscape of AI models for image, video, and text generation is shaped by innovations from leading technology companies, leveraging advanced core technologies such as diffusion models and transformer models. Diffusion models are particularly effective in generating highly detailed and realistic images, refining visual outputs through iterative processes.

Lee et al. [53] presents a method to improve building code compliance checking by defining high-level, implementable methods that enhance low- level rule-checking procedures, thereby automating the translation of natural language building regulations into explicitly defined rules. The authors propose high-level computer programming operators designed to translate verb phrases in building act sentences into clear, actionable rules, ensuring minimal ambiguity and accurate representation of building object properties. They classified and filtered building- permit-related regulations from the Korean Building Act, extracting verb phrases to clarify the functions and arguments of the methods. These methods were organized into a four-level hierarchy based on targets, property types, checking types, and specific methods. The proposed methods translate verb phrases into building code sentences, retrieve data from a building model, and produce return values, which are then structured using IF-THEN-ELSE logic for rule translation. The intermediate code generated can be used in various rule-checking applications, supported by a reusable database for efficient compliance checking.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for this task but face issues like gradient explosion and overfitting. This study explores the use of an attention mechanism, specifically the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), to enhance CNN models for flash flood susceptibility in the ungauged Rheraya watershed, a flood prone region. We used ResNet18, DenseNet121, and Xception as backbone architectures, integrating CBAM at different locations. Our dataset included 16 conditioning factors and 522 flash flood inventory points. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Results showed that CBAM significantly improved model performance, with DenseNet121 incorporating CBAM in each convolutional block achieving the best results (accuracy = 0.95, AUC = 0.98).

Introduction", "content": "Flash floods are considered one of the most devastating, costly, challenging, and widespread natural hazards globally. These events emerge from rapid and excessive rainfall occurring within a concise timeframe, typically around 6 hours, and often in mountainous environments, resulting in erosion, landslides, substantial damage to infrastructure and properties, and even significant loss of life. In fact, they are responsible for almost 84% of global deaths related to natural disaster. In recent years, scientific communities worldwide have expressed huge concern about flash floods, as they expect that global warming, population growth, deforestation, and land use planning will increase the frequency and severity of these events, which will result in significant economic and social impacts. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective spatial prediction of flash flood occurrences on different spatial scales to mitigate their damaging impacts.\nAchieving absolute prevention of flood damage seems like a challenging and complex task. Flood management efforts therefore increasingly prioritize proactive measures like evaluating susceptibility and vulnerability in flood-prone regions. The comprehensive understanding and identification of these susceptible areas through advanced and appropriate mapping techniques can offer effective mitigation strategies."}, {"title": "2.

Its outlet is defined by the Tahanaout hydrometric station at coordinates 31.3\u00b0N, 7.9\u00b0E. Key population centers in this region include Asni, Imlil, and Moulay Brahim. Regarded as a significant catchment area in the High Atlas range, the Rheraya covers approximately 224 km2, with elevations spanning from 1084 to 4167 meters and steep slopes reaching up to 80\u00b0. The region experiences an average annual rainfall of 363 mm, with temperatures ranging typically between 18 and 38 degrees Celsius. Hillslopes within this area are characterized by degraded rangelands with sparse vegetation and rocky terrain, while the valley hosts a narrow stretch of cultivated land on both sides of the river."}, {"title": "2.2. Flash flood inventory", "content": "Identifying and creating a precise historical inventory of flash floods is an essential step in assessing and investigating the relationship between flash floods and their causal factors, enabling the development of accurate flash flood susceptibility maps. Current approaches rely on historical archives, field surveys, and remote sensing satellite data. In this study, we generated an inventory of historical flash flood events based on records from the Hydraulic Basin Agency of Tensift (ABHT), followed by a field survey in which local residents contributed to the development of this inventory. Validating the obtained data is a mandatory step to ensure its trustworthiness and accuracy. Therefore, pre-flood and post-flood remote-sensing images were analyzed to ascertain the existence and validation of the documented flash flood records. We calculated the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization water index (SDWI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI) using Landsat data to identify the flooded areas. The validation step was conducted using the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE).\nA total of 261 flash flood locations from 1994 to 2022 were identified. Additionally, we generated 261 points designated as 'non-flash flood' from areas where there was no evidence of flash flood occurrences using the geo-processing tool 'create random points', within the data management tool in ArcGIS software."}, {"title": "2.3. Flash conditioning factors", "content": "The process of identifying flash flood causative factors lacks a universal framework, as it depends on the complex interactions between local environmental dynamics and historical flash flood events. Also, these phenomena have characteristics that differ from region to region. Therefore, selecting the most sensitive flash flood conditioning factors is critical for developing an accurate flash flood-susceptibility map. In this study, 16 conditioning factors were thoughtfully selected based on a comprehensive literature review of previous studies, data availability, and the characteristics of flash flood development in the Rheraya watershed. We made sure to consider different aspects of the study area, including topographical, hydrological, meteorological, environmental, and anthropogenic features. All factors were transformed into raster format, then aligned and resampled to 12.5 meters to ensure spatial consistency. Subsequently, data standardization was implemented to ensure a consistent scale and distribution of data values. Finally, the entire dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing sets."}, {"title": "2.3.1. Topographical factors", "content": "The topographical factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to river, convergence index (CI), topographical positioning index (TPI), and ruggedness index (RI), were computed via processing in ArcGIS 10.2. The derived data were obtained using a 12.5 m-resolution PALSAR Phased Array type L-band Digital Elevation Model (DEM) obtained from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF). Elevation is a key factor in flash flood modeling, given the inverse relationship between elevation and flash floods. With decreasing elevation, the terrain tends to flatten, leading to increased river water flow and vice versa. Slope is a critical factor that affects flash floods occurrence, since it affects the speed of the water flow. Regions with gentler slopes are more likely to accumulate water, potentially facilitating higher infiltration rates and reduced surface runoff speeds. These areas could be more prone to flash floods. Aspect refers to the direction of the predominant slope on the surface of the terrain. It indirectly affects flash flooding as it influences floodwater flow directions, which helps to maintain soil moisture. Curvature delineates areas where runoff diverges or converges, impacting water flow dynamics. Runoff speed can vary based on the slope. Convex slopes often promote faster overland flow, potentially affecting infiltration and soil saturation, whereas concave slopes might slow down overland flow and potentially aid infiltration. Distance to river significantly influences flash flood vulnerability within a watershed as it affects the extent of flooding. Areas close to the hydrographic network often face a higher susceptibility to flooding compared to those situated farther away. The topographic position index (TPI) measures the elevation difference between a specific point and its surrounding area. It helps identify topographic features like valleys, hills, or bottoms. Generally, areas with higher elevations and steeper slope, indicated by TPI, tend to be less susceptible to flash flooding compared to lower-lying regions. The ruggedness index measures terrain roughness based on elevation variations. In flash floods, rugged terrain might affect water flow patterns, potentially influencing flash flood behavior due to altered landscape topography."}, {"title": "2.3.2. Hydrological and meteorological factors", "content": "Hydrological and meteorological factors directly influence the occurrence and severity of flash floods. Various factors were taken into consideration in this study, such as stream power index (SPI), topographical wetness index (TWI), drainage density, convergence index, flow accumulation, and rainfall. SPI quantifies a river's erosive potential by assessing its ability to transport sediment and erode its bed during flood events, influencing the river's overall fluvial system. TWI identifies variations in spatial wetness and highlights areas susceptible to water accumulation. It helps predict potential flash flood-prone zones by considering the ratios of basin area to slope angles. Drainage density measures the total length of streams within a watershed area. Higher drainage densities suggest increased surface runoff potential, which can contribute to flooding under certain conditions. The convergence index measures the degree of river network convergence within a region, highlighting valleys and inter-alluvial surfaces. Flow accumulation quantifies the cumulative flow contribution from neighboring cells towards each specific cell within a terrain. It is a crucial factor in identifying water accumulation patterns and potential flash flood-prone areas in a landscape. Rainfall is one of the most critical factors that causes flash floods. These sudden floods arise when rainfall exceeds the ground's capacity to absorb water, causing rapid and unexpected flooding. In this study, we used data from 1994 to 2022 collected from two specific meteorological stations, i.e., Tahanaout and Armed, obtained from the hydraulic basin agency of Tensift (ABHT). The IDW (i.e., inverse distance weighted) interpolation method was then used to compute the precipitation variable using ArcGIS 10.2 software."}, {"title": "2.3.3. Environmental and anthropogenic factors", "content": "Environmental and anthropogenic factors included the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), landcover, and distance to roads. The NDVI is an index that reflects the changes in vegetation and surface water cover over time. It expresses the density of vegetation in a region and has a strong influence on flash flooding. Areas with lower vegetation cover often exhibit increased vulnerability to flooding. In this study, the NDVI was calculated using Sentinel-2 Level-2A data spanning six years, from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022, which included a total of 538 Sentinel-2 images. These images were filtered to include only the ones with a cloud cover of 20% or less. Through Google Earth Engine (GEE), we generated a raster representing the mean NDVI across all these years. Land cover has a significant influence on surface runoff, infiltration, evaporation, and sediment transport. It directly affects flash flood occurrence and frequency, which aids in identifying highly susceptible areas. Urban areas characterized by impermeable surfaces, for instance, are more likely to be flooded compared to areas covered by farmlands, forests, and green vegetation. We used the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover product, which provides a global land cover map for 2021 at 10 m resolution based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The landcover categories included 7 classes, including tree cover, shrubland, grassland, cropland, built-up, bare or sparse vegetation, and permanent water bodies. Distance from roads can significantly impact flooding and the susceptibility of an area to flood risks. Roads often act as barriers, altering natural drainage patterns and increasing surface runoff, elevating flash flood vulnerability. Therefore, distance to roads could be an important variable of flash flood susceptibility. We extracted road data from Open Street Map (OSM), and then we calculated the distance from each pixel to the road feature using the Euclidean distance in ArcGIS 10.2."}, {"title": "2.4. Methodology", "content": "In the present research, a CBAM-based CNN model was developed to assess flash flood susceptibility in the Rheraya watershed. Given their advantages, three representative deep CNNs, namely, ResNet 18, Xception, and DenseNet121, were used as the backbone architectures. To investigate the impact of the CBAM block on flash flood susceptibility outcomes, we integrated the CBAM at various points within these CNN architectures. Specifically, we tested three insertion points: plugging CBAM into each block of the backbone architecture, at the head of the backbone architecture, and at the tail of the backbone architecture.\nThe workflow of the study is presented as a flowchart in Figure 6, consisting of five main steps: (1) compilation of the GIS and remote sensing database, including flash flood inventory data and 16 well-selected flash flood conditioning variables; (2) identification and removal of redundant flash flood influencing variables through factor optimization (i.e., Pearson's correlation and multi-collinearity analysis), followed by the splitting of the database into training, validation, and testing datasets; (3) developed and trained multiple CBAM-based CNNs, including the attention block at different locations within the architectures, and then evaluated and compared their performance using various statistical metrics.

Model weights and biases were initialized from scratch, and the network was trained with a batch size of 4. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, decreasing by a factor of 10 whenever the validation set's accuracy showed no improvement for 10 consecutive epochs. Models with the lowest validation loss were chosen. Binary cross-entropy served as the loss function for the CNNs.

Factor optimization", "content": "Identifying and filtering redundant flash flood-influencing factors with limited classification ability enhances the accuracy of the process as it overcomes training challenges related to high data dimensionality. In the context of classification or regression problems, it is crucial that independent variables exhibit minimal correlation. This increases the prediction power of the models by selecting the most significant factors and removing the irrelevant ones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the dependency between the flash flood conditioning variables through correlation and multicollinearity tests. In this study, we initially computed the Pearson correlation coefficient to examine correlations, followed by computing the variance inflation factor (VIF) to assess multicollinearity. These commonly used metrics have demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy in selecting relevant variables in flood susceptibility analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient quantifies the linear correlation between two datasets, serving as a tool to evaluate how changes in one variable align with changes in another. It has values ranging from 1 to 1, where a strong correlation is indicated by values equal to or greater than 0.7, a significant correlation falls between 0.5 and 0.7, a weak correlation is between 0.3 and 0.5, and no correlation is indicated when values are lower than 0.3.

To overcome these issues, ResNet incorporates skip connections or shortcuts. Notably, the ResNet model exhibits superior performance compared to alternative architectures, as its effectiveness does not diminish with increasing depth. This results in more efficient computational calculations and improved network training capabilities.\nThe ResNet architecture employs skip connections across two to three layers, incorporating Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and batch normalization.He et al. (2016) demonstrated that ResNet excels in image classification, outperforming other models and highlighting its proficiency in extracting image features. The implementation of residual learning across multiple layers is a key aspect of ResNet's success. The residual block in ResNet is defined as:\n$$y = F(x, W + x)$$\nwhere x is the input layer, y is the output layer, and F represents the residual map. ResNet's residual block is effective when input and output data dimensions are identical. Additionally, each ResNet block comprises either two layers (for ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 networks) or three layers (for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 networks).

This design fosters extensive feature reuse throughout the network, resulting in well-performing and more compact models with fewer trainable parameters compared to an equivalent-sized ResNet.

Unlike standard convolutions, Xception utilizes depthwise separable convolutions, consisting of two steps: depthwise convolutions, where a separate 3x3 convolution is applied for each channel, capturing spatial dependencies; and pointwise convolutions, employing a 1x1 convolution across all channels to mix information. This design optimizes parameter usage, reducing computational costs while preserving expressive power.

It can be integrated into any CNN to enhance its representational capacity by guiding the model to focus on relevant features and ignore non-useful background information. The architectural overview of CBAM is depicted in Figure 8a. CBAM combines channel and spatial information through convolution operations, emphasizing key features in the convolution layers. This is achieved with two sequential sub-modules: the channel attention module and the spatial attention module, as shown in Figure 8b. Below, we describe the details of each sub-module:\nChannel attention module: in the convolution process, each channel of intermediate features is treated as a feature detector. The channel attention module exploits inter-channel relationships to determine the importance of each channel. Initially, the spatial dimension of intermediate features undergoes average-pooling and max-pooling to generate two distinct context features. Subsequently, these features are transformed by a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and combined through element-wise summation. The resulting fused feature is activated by a sigmoid function, representing the channel importance of the original feature map. Mathematically, the channel attention module's calculation process is defined as:\n$$Mc(F) = fsigmoid (MLP(AvgPool(F)) + MLP(MaxPool(F)))$$\nSpatial attention module: in contrast to the channel attention module, the spatial attention module focuses on determining \"where\" in the input space significant information lies, complementing the channel attention. It aims to generate refined features by exploiting inter-spatial relations in the original features. This involves applying average-pooling and max-pooling along the channel axis, concatenating the outputs, and converting the concatenated descriptor into a spatial attention map through a 7 \u00d7 7 convolution and a sigmoid operation. The spatial attention module's computation can be expressed as:\n$$Ms(F) = fsigmoid (Conv([AvgPool(F); MaxPool(F)]))$$\nFinally, CBAM combines attention maps derived from the channel and spatial attention modules to generate refined feature maps. The combination of the two sub-modules is described by:\n$$F' = M(F) \\otimes F$$\n$$F'' = Mg(F') \\otimes F'$$\nwhere F represents an intermediate feature map of the CNN, denotes element-wise multiplication, and F\" is the resulting refined feature map."}, {"title": "2.4.3.

Our focus was on observing the resultant reduction in AUC concerning the original value. The percentage of relative decrease (PRD) emerged as a crucial metric in this analysis. The importance of the excluded factor is considered more pronounced if the PRD experiences a more substantial reduction. The PRD is determined by the formula:\n$$PRD = \\frac{100 \\times AUC_{0} - AUC_{i}}{AUC_{0}}$$\nHere, $AUC_{0}$ represents the original AUC value encompassing all factors, while $AUC_{i}$ denotes the AUC value when the i-th factor has been excluded."}, {"title": "3.

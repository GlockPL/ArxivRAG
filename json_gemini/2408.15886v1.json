As IoT networks expand, the need for robust security measures to counteract potential threats has become increasingly critical. This paper introduces a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that synergistically combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with the XGBoost algorithm. Our proposed IDS leverages the unique capabilities of KANs, which utilize learnable activation functions to model complex relationships within data, alongside the powerful ensemble learning techniques of XGBoost, known for its high performance in classification tasks. This hybrid approach not only enhances the detection accuracy but also improves the interpretability of the model, making it suitable for dynamic and intricate IoT environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our hybrid IDS achieves an impressive detection accuracy exceeding 99% in distinguishing between benign and malicious activities. Additionally, we were able to achieve F1-scores, precision, and recall that are exceeding 98%. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis against traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks, assessing performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results underscore the efficacy of integrating KANs with XGBoost, highlighting the potential of this innovative approach to significantly strengthen the security framework of IoT networks.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has come a long way since Kevin Ashton first introduced the term in 1999 [1]. Initially, the idea was to connect RFID devices to the internet, but today, IoT has expanded to include a wide variety of electronic devices-ranging from sensors and actuators to smartphones and smart home appliances. These devices communicate with one another using unique identifiers, working together to accomplish various tasks. However, this integration of diverse devices also brings significant security challenges [2]. Although encryption is a fundamental aspect of IoT security and serves as the first line of defense against potential threats, relying solely on it is insufficient [3], [4]. To effectively detect and respond to attacks, additional security measures, such as Location Obfuscation as shown in [5], and/or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) [6], [7], are essential. One significant threat to IoT networks is botnets\u2014malicious software that can exploit poorly configured devices [8]. To develop effective IDS solutions and address the unique security challenges faced by IoT systems, realistic and specifically designed datasets are crucial. Despite the availability of various cybersecurity datasets, there is a critical need for those tailored to the IoT environment.\nTo address these security issues, researchers have developed a range of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that leverage machine learning methods. Combining Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and chaotic neural networks, Shettar et al. [9] devel-oped a hybrid model to enhance attack detection accuracy and precision while significantly decreasing false alarms. Their experiments using the KDD Cup '99 dataset showed that the hybrid model outperformed the MLP alone in reducing false alarms without sacrificing accuracy, precision, or recall. Mushtaq et. al. [10] proposed an intrusion detection system, SE-IDS, which employs a stacked ensemble architecture. The base learners comprising the system include decision trees, XGBoost, bagging, extra trees, and random forest. The pre-dictions generated by these base learners are subsequently fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner to produce the final classification. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the NSL-KDD dataset. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network that utilizes a hybrid feature selection scheme namely, Information Gain Random Forest (IGRF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), is proposed by Yin et al. [11]. According to the authors, the scheme combines the efficiency of filter methods with the effectiveness of wrapper approaches for feature selection. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using the"}, {"title": "II. PROPOSED METHOD", "content": "At the heart of our proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) lie KANs. Unlike traditional MLPS, KANs are based on a radically new architecture inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. This section provides basic information about KANs and the basic approach behind them. Our work is different in its new application to the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network within intrusion detection sys-tems. This work presents, as a first study on KAN for intrusion detection systems, a well-explained and detailed analysis of how this improved network architecture can further enhance detection capabilities in IoT environments. This pioneering application not only manifests the versatility of KAN for a totally different domain but also charts a new way for further research into methodologies of intrusion detection systems. Introduced by [8], KANs differ from MPLs, in that they employ learnable activation functions at the network edges to allow a more flexible, and hence potentially powerful represen-tation. More specifically, KANs work as a series of transfor-mations of the input values described by univariate functions applied to the network edges. That is implemented following the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which defines multivariate functions as the following formulation (see Eq. 1):\n$f(x_1,...,x_l) = \\sum_{q=1}^{2l+1}I_q(\\sum_{p=1}^{l}\\varphi_{q,p}(x_p))$\nWhere $\\varphi_{q,p}: [0,1] \\rightarrow R$ and $I_q : R \\rightarrow R$.\nThe structure of KANs organizes each layer as a matrix of these learnable 1D functions as follows (refer to Equation 2):\n$\\Phi = {\\varphi_{q,p}}, p = 1,..., N_{in}, q = 1,2,..., N_{out}$\nEach activation function $\\phi_{q,p}$ itself is an instance of B-splines, a special form of spline function acquired through the superposition of basis splines. This makes the network much more capable of learning complex patterns in the data. The number of features in input to a layer is $n_{in}$, and the number of features in the output generated by the same layer is $n_{out}$, indicating dimensionality transformations over the network layers.\nStructurally, KANs are similar to MLPs in that they are layer-oriented. Still, in their functional mappings, the KANS utilize more complex mechanisms than just linear transforma-tions or fixed activations. A typical KAN consists of M layers, as in Eq. 3:\n$KAN(x) = (\\Phi_{M-1} \\circ \\Phi_{M-2} \\circ ... \\circ \\Phi_1 \\circ \\Phi_0)x$\nConsidering the unique structure, KANs are capable of capturing complicated relationships among data that traditional neural networks cannot. Our proposed IDS harnesses this capability to improve the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection significantly."}, {"title": "III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "content": "In this section, we describe the dataset used in our proposed model. Afterward, the experimental setting, evaluation metrics, and performance results have been discussed in detail."}, {"title": "A. Dataset Description", "content": "Our study is based on the N-BaIoT dataset, introduced by Meidan et al. [15], which includes both benign and malicious network traffic. Malicious traffic was generated by infecting the network with instances of the Bashlite and/or Mirai Botnet attacks. The data collection took place from nine different but commonplace devices representing five different device types: thermostat, doorbell, webcam, security camera, and baby monitor. In the original dataset, the ratio of benign cases against total malicious cases goes as low as 1.59% to 19% per device.\nThe dataset comprises 23 primary attributes, each measured across five different time frames with decay factors (lambda) of L5, L3, L1, L0.1, and L0.01. This results in a total of 115 features (23 x 5) for each instance. This dataset displays a diverse distribution of traffic types, including multiple Mirai and Bashlite attack variants. Each device's dataset contains a substantial number of both benign and malicious instances, providing a comprehensive basis for evaluating the perfor-mance of the proposed IDS. \nFor our experiments, we employ a reduced version of the original dataset, focusing on seven of the nine devices that were subjected to both Mirai and Bashlite attacks. The specific devices included in our study are as follows: Danmini doorbell, Ecobee thermostat, Phillips B120N10 Baby Monitor, Provision PT737E security camera, Provision PT838 security camera, Simple Home XCS7 1002 WHT security camera, Simple Home XCS7 1003 WHT security camera.\nOur experimental dataset has 500,000 instances, shown in Figure 3, structured as follows: 430,000 normal instances (Class 0) were randomly drawn from seven device datasets, and another 70,000 malicious instances (Classes 1-10) were prepared by randomly sampling 1,000 samples from every kind of attack for each device dataset. This balanced construc-tion will ensure that normal and malicious network activities are appropriately represented, which will establish a reliable base for training and testing our proposed Intrusion Detection System."}, {"title": "B. Experimental Setup", "content": "The proposed IDS uses a hybrid scheme that includes both XGBoost and KANs. On the other hand, in the case of complex, nonlinear relationships between the inputs and outputs, KANs will be very accurate. XGBoost will deal with large datasets efficiently at high performance. The feature space is composed of 115 features that will feed the KAN section. The output from KAN is fed into the XGBoost sequentially. In this experiment, quite a good number of hyper-parameters were tuned to best suit the model. In this context, training was made for 50 epochs with a batch size of 512. The learning rate used in this study is 0.001. The KAN applied in the model consisted of a single layer with 10 output units. The input features were 115, while the model was designed for classification into 11 output classes. The KAN interval and order were set to 7 and 5, respectively. In this regard, the cross-entropy loss function was used, while optimization utilized the ADAM optimizer. A StepLR scheduler was applied with a step size of 10 and gamma of 0.5 for adjusting the learning rate. For the component XGBoost, a number of estimators was set to 100, with the learning rate set to 0.1 and the maximum depth configured to 6."}, {"title": "IV.

Focusing on a recent poll conducted by Ipsos on a set of questions posed by Sir Humphrey Appleby in an episode of the British political satire Yes, Prime Minister, we show that the resulting data cannot be explained quite so simply using quantum rules, although it seems not impossible.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In an episode of the satirical British political sitcom Yes, Prime Minister from the 1980s, Sir Humphrey Appleby once explained to Bernard Woolley (two of the characters) how it is possible to get contradictory polling results by asking a series of leading questions beforehand. The polling discussed in the episode concerns whether the public is for or against the reintroduction of national service. Recently, the leading questions outlined by Appleby were put to the public by the market research and polling giant Ipsos, the findings of which have been made public to raise awareness of the fact that people can be misled by means of a such questions [1]. The actual experiment conducted by Ipsos is explained on their web site: \u201cIpsos interviewed a representative quota sample of 2,158 adults aged 16-75 in Great Britain. Half saw the \u2018Sample A' questions, reflecting a positive view about national service. Half saw\u2018Sample B', reflecting a negative view.\" For the convenience of readers I quote their findings in Tables I and II below.\nThe leading questions are there to provide contexts to the final question, and to many there is little surprise in the results indicated in the two tables. The issue, however, is that such context-dependent outcomes are not compatible with laws of classical probability. Leaving aside the minor semantic debate in Question 5 of the two samples (one could rea- sonably argue that not opposing need not be the same as favouring), in one case the data shows that 45% of the people are in support of reintroducing national service as opposed to 38% against, while in the other case this figure is 34% for and 48% against \u2013 thus violating the law of conditional probability. The argument for the violation goes as follows. Let A denote the series of four leading questions in Sample A. Each question can be answered in three different ways, so in total there are 12 possible ways {A\u1d62} to answer these questions. Similarly, let B denote the series of four questions in Sample B, which can again be answered in 12 possible ways {B\u1d62}. Let X be the fifth question, on national service, which we assume"}, {"title": "Conjunction fallacy revisited", "content": "One key ingredient in quantum probability that distinguishes it from its classical counter- part is that questions (observables) are in general not compatible, and hence question order does matter. Perhaps the simplest way of seeing this is to consider a spin measurement of a spin-\u00bd particle. Let X denote the question whether the measurement of the spin x in the x direction is up, and similarly Y for the spin measurement in the y direction. Suppose that the initial state of the particle is the \u00f4\u2082 eigenstate with the eigenvalue +1 (that is, X = UP state). Then clearly we have\n$P(X = UP) = 1.$"}, {"title": "", "content": "However, if we first measure \u00f4y, and subsequently measure \u00f4x, then irrespective of the outcome of the Y measurement we have\n$P(X = UP) = \\frac{1}{2}.$\nIf the X and Y measurements were to model two binary questions, we therefore find that in general question-order effects (that the answers depend on the order of questions) are consequences of incompatible (non-commuting) questions. This is the quintessential argu- ment that the mathematical structures underpinning quantum theory leading to probability assignment rules are more adequate for modelling human cognitive behaviour than their classical counterparts.\nWith this in mind, let us discuss the case of the conjunction fallacy [17]. The most well- publicized example of a conjunction fallacy concerns an experiment in which participants are first given information about the profile of a hypothetical person Linda, that they are single, outspoken, bright, concerned about social justice, and so on. The profile is designed to offer the impression that Linda is more likely to be a feminist than being a bank teller. Participants are then asked to rank-order the likelihoods of Linda being a bank teller (B), a bank teller and a feminist (B & F), and a feminist (F). Perhaps not surprisingly, the findings were that\n$P(F) > P(B & F) > P(B).$\nIn classical probability, while the first inequality is admissible, the second one is problematic because it cannot be that the probability of Linda being both a feminist and a bank teller is larger than that of being merely a bank teller.\nIn the literature of quantum cognition it is understood that the constraint of classical probability here can be circumvented on account of the assumption that measurement of B and measurement of F are not compatible. The analysis presented, for instance, in [5, 14] shows how this can be explained. Their argument goes in essence as follows. If we let q denote the probability that Linda is a bank teller and let p denote the probability that Linda is a feminist, then the initial state can be expressed in two different ways:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\sqrt{p}|F\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-p}|\\overline{F}\\rangle = \\sqrt{q}|B\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-q}|\\overline{B}\\rangle.$\nHere, |F\u3009 denotes the state that Linda is a feminist, |\\overline{F}\u3009= \u3008F| denotes the state that Linda is not a feminist, and similarly for |B\u3009 and |\\overline{B}\u3009 for the states of being a bank teller or not. The argument of [14] is that in assessing the probability P(B & F), it is natural to first to ask whether Linda is a feminist because of the association with the provided profile of Linda. Once the result of the feminist question is affirmative, and if |B\u3009 is closer to |F\u3009 than to |\u03c8\u3009, then the likelihood of B conditional on F becomes larger than the initial likelihood of B. In other words, the state |\u03c8\u3009 can be such that we obtain the inequality $p > p|\\langle B|F\\rangle|^2 > q$ to explain the data.\nThis experiment can be modified slightly into the following thought experiment to assess the impact of leading questioners. Once the profile of Linda is provided, participants are split into two groups. One group of participants is asked if Linda is a bank teller, which will determine P(B); another group is first asked if she is a feminist, which will determine P(F), and this is followed by the question if they thought she could be a bank teller. This latter question will then determine the likelihood $P_F(B)$ that she is thought to be a bank teller, having being assessed whether she might be a feminist. Importantly, though, this is not a conditional statement about the answer to the first question (as in the conjunction fallacy"}, {"title": "", "content": "experiment), because irrespective of the answer to the feminist question, all participants in the second group are asked the followup question. If it turns out that $P_F(B) \u2260 P(B)$, then we can interpret the feminist question as a leading question to alter the outcome of the bank-teller question. (This experiment, in a different setup, has indeed been performed to show this effect [10].)\nTo work out the conditional probability $P_F(B)$, it suffices to consider the state after the feminist question is settled. This is given by the density matrix\n$\\rho_F = p|F\\rangle\\langle F|+ (1-p) |\\overline{F}\\rangle\\langle \\overline{F}|.$\nThen we have $P_F(B) = \\langle B|\\rho_F|B\\rangle$. To calculate this expectation, it helps to express |B\u3009 in terms of |F\u3009 and |\\overline{F}\u3009. Writing $|B\\rangle = \\sqrt{a}|F\\rangle + \\sqrt{1-a}|\\overline{F}\\rangle$, a short calculation shows that\n$\\sqrt{a} = \\sqrt{pq}+ \\sqrt{(1 \u2013 p)(1 \u2013 q)},$\nfrom which we deduce that\n$P_F(B) = 2p(p \u2212 1)(2q \u2212 1) + q + 2(2p \u2013 1) \\sqrt{pq(1-p)(1 \u2013 q)} .$\nIn Figure 1 the three probabilities P(B) = q, P(F) = p, and $P_F(B)$ are plotted as functions of p and q. The figure clearly shows that there is a large region in parameter space for which the inequality\n$P(F) > P_F(B) > P(B)$\nholds. In fact, the equality $P_F(B) = P(B)$ expected to follow from classical probability assignment rules holds if and only if p = q. But this is precisely the case in which the two observables F and B commute, i.e. when they are compatible. In fact, $P_F(B) = P(B)$ also holds if p = 0 or p = 1, but these cases are redundant because the initial state is already an eigenstate of F and hence measurement of F will have no impact. It follows that phenomena of the type $P_F(B) \u2260 P(B)$ considered here (often referred to as the interference effect in the quantum cognition literature because measurement of F interferes with the outcome of B), which are commonly observed in psychology experiments, demand the application of quantum probability theory."}, {"title": "Appleby's leading questions", "content": "Returning to the effect of leading-questions shown on Tables I and II, in line with the standard formulation in quantum cognition whereby asking a question is modelled as per- forming a measurement of an observable, it would be interesting to see whether the data obtained by Ipsos can be modelled by means of a suitably chosen initial state along with a series of five observables in a three-dimensional Hilbert space. If so, then the quantum formalism can be used to model the effects of leading questions reported in the Ipsos data.\nOn a closer inspection of the data, however, we find that the answer is negative. Note that asking a series of questions will result in a transformation of the state of mind repre- sented by the density matrix. In particular, each time a question is asked, the state will transform in accordance with the von Neumann-L\u00fcders projection postulate [18], and there are consequences of this postulate. In particular, the resulting map acting on quantum state has to satisfy the complete positivity condition [19]. One implication here is that"}, {"title": "Classical vs quantum probabilities", "content": "The foregoing formulation of using incompatible observables to represent Appleby's lead- ing questions is not the only way to model them. In classical probability theory, if there are two questions, then they are modelled as two random variables that may be mutually depen- dent or not. In either case, there is no constraint resulting from the contraction property. For instance, if the two random variables are independent, then clearly the statistics for the first question will not have any implication on the second. The issue, however, is that the discrepancy of Question 5 in the two samples cannot be explained using classical probability theory. What I would like to address now therefore is whether a quantum analogue of a multi-variate probability distribution might be able to explain the data.\nTo this end we remark that classical probability theory can be formulated on Hilbert space by means of the square-root embedding [20, 21]. For instance, if X is a binary random variable taking the values (x\u2081, x\u2082) with probabilities (P\u2081, P\u2082), then it can be modelled as a matrix with eigenvalues (x\u2081, x\u2082) on Hilbert space, while the state is given by a vector with"}, {"title": "Can entanglement explain leading question effect?", "content": "With these considerations, let us represent the set of five questions in, say, Table I, as five local observables, each acting on its own Hilbert space, while the state of mind is modelled as an arbitrary (possibly entangled) state in the 3\u2075 = 243-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, an observable that corresponds, say, to the second question Q\u2082 is said to be \u201clocal\" if it takes the form $I\u2081 \u2297 Q\u2082 \u2297 I\u2083 \u00d0 I\u2084 \u2297 I\u2085$, where $I_k$ denotes the identity matrix in the kth Hilbert space. In such a model, while the increase in the maximum probability (or decrease in the minimum probability) from one question to another can easily be explained. However,"}, {"title": "Ipsos data on Appleby's questions can be modelled by isolating the first question", "content": "Another approach that in principle can work to model the Ipsos data is to regard, for each sample, the first question as an independent isolated question, modelled on its own 3- dimensional Hilbert space. The remaining four questions are then modelled on yet another 3-dimensional Hilbert space as four incompatible observables. In other words, it is analogous to having two particles in a disentangled state for which on the first particle one measurement is performed, while on the second particle a series of four incompatible measurements is performed. Because the state is disentangled, the outcome of the measurement on the first particle will impose no constraint on the measurements on the second particle. (In Sample B, the map going from the second to the third question also violates the complete positivity, but the violation here is relatively small, so one could reasonably argue that it falls within the error margin.) That is, we express the initial state as a product state\n$\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\left|\\begin{array}{l}q_{1} \\\\ q_{2} \\\\ q_{3}\\end{array}\\right|}{p_{1}}  \\frac{\\left|\\begin{array}{l}q_{1} \\\\ q_{2} \\\\ q_{3}\\end{array}\\right|}{p_{2}} . \\frac{\\left|\\begin{array}{l}q_{1} \\\\ q_{2} \\\\ q_{3}\\end{array}\\right|}{p_{3}}$\nin a nine-dimensional Hilbert space, where the probabilities {pi} refer to those of the first question and {qi} to the second equation, when the state is expressed in the basis of these"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "We have shown that in general the leading-question effect, while cannot be explained using classical probability theory, can nonetheless be explained using quantum probability theory. However, there are constraints within the allowable quantum transformations that may prevent the modelling of certain data. In particular, when it comes to the Ipsos data presented in Tables I and II, they cannot be modelled using the most straightforward ap- proaches in terms of a set of incompatible \u201cglobal\u201d observables, or in terms of a set of local observables in an entangled state. A workable scheme has been provided, but the approach requires a justification in the form of further experimental data.\nShould this scheme fail the experimental test, there still remain other possibilities. For example, consider a question having three or more answers, modelled on a Hilbert space of"}, {"title": "", "content": "dimension three or larger. Having settled this question, if one were to ask a \u201cdegenerate\u201d binary question, then in this case the probability of an affirmative answer can exceed any of the probabilities of the first question, without violating the contraction constraint. Such a model, however, does not lends itself with the context of Appleby's questions considered here. Nevertheless, it may be possible that by a clever construction involving a large-dimensional Hilbert space along with partially nonlocal degenerate observables and an entangled initial state, one can model the Ipsos data using quantum probability rules. Whether such a construction exists to fit the data of Tables I and II is an open question.\nIn traditional cognitive psychology, when the behaviour of people in their reasoning and decision making does not follow the rules of classical probability theory, then they are classi- fied as being \u201cirrational\u201d [26]. Quantum cognition expands the scope of mathematics under- pinning outcome of chance used in classical probability theory to re-classify many examples of such \"irrational\u201d behaviour as being perfectly rational, because they can be modelled con- sistently using quantum probability theory. An important ingredient in the use of quantum probability in modelling cognitive science, apart from the existence of incompatible proposi- tions, is how the state of mind transforms in reasoning and decision making. Typically, this is governed by the von Neumann-L\u00fcders rule [18]. Now this rule has several advantages. To begin, if all proposition or information being processed are compatible, then the rule repro- duces the Bayesian logic [15, 16]. This follows from the fact that conditioning in classical probability merely implies projection on Hilbert space. It provides a way of \u201cseparating what we know from what we want to know"}]}

{"title": "THE 2021 TOKYO OLYMPICS MULTILINGUAL NEWS ARTICLE\nDATASET", "authors": ["Erik Novak", "Erik Calcina", "Dunja Mladeni\u0107", "Marko Grobelnik"], "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a dataset of multilingual news articles covering the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\nA total of 10,940 news articles were gathered from 1,918 different publishers, covering 1,350 sub-\nevents of the 2021 Olympics, and published between July 1, 2021, and August 14, 2021. These\narticles are written in nine languages from different language families and in different scripts. To\ncreate the dataset, the raw news articles were first retrieved via a service that collects and analyzes\nnews articles. Then, the articles were grouped using an online clustering algorithm, with each group\ncontaining articles reporting on the same sub-event. Finally, the groups were manually annotated and\nevaluated. The development of this dataset aims to provide a resource for evaluating the performance\nof multilingual news clustering algorithms, for which limited datasets are available. It can also be\nused to analyze the dynamics and events of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics from different perspectives.\nThe dataset is available in CSV format and can be accessed from the CLARIN.SI repository.", "sections": [{"title": "Background & Summary", "content": "Through news articles, we can learn about global events. Different publishers report the same event from various\nperspectives, highlighting what they find essential for their audience. Depending on the publisher's country, articles\nmay be in different languages and may reflect the writer's biases. Thus, news articles are key for identifying world\nevents, their coverage, and their global significance. To analyze these aspects, we need effective methods to group\nmultilingual news articles based on their events, which typically involve similar entities (who/what was involved), time\n(when it happened), and place (where it happened).\nThere is a scarcity of multilingual news datasets for developing methods and models to group articles reporting on the\nsame event.\nFurthermore, most datasets contain primarily English articles, making them unsuitable for multilingual tasks. Those\nthat are multilingual are typically designed for other news-related tasks, such as discrimination (SETimes.HBS [13])\nand alignment (Hashemi et al. dataset [14]) between languages, language simplification (SNIML [15]), and news\nsummarization (MassiveSumm [16]). Multilingual news datasets, such as CC News [17] and Babel Briefings [18], are\ndeveloped to analyze world events, cultural narratives, and more. In addition to datasets, news monitoring systems such"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "This section focuses on the approach used to create the OG2021 dataset. It first describes the news retrieval, followed\nby their annotation process."}, {"title": "News Retrieval", "content": "Before we can begin any data processing, we must first retrieve the relevant news articles. This section describes the\ndefined criteria and the approach taken to retrieve these articles."}, {"title": "Criteria definition", "content": "To retrieve the appropriate articles, we first defined the criteria that the articles must follow. The requirements consist of\nthree conditions: (1) the languages in which the article must be written, (2) the publication time, which must be within\na predefined time range, and (3) the contextual concepts the article must include.\nLanguages. We aim to include articles in languages from diverse language families and scripts to represent a wide range\nof linguistic features. Following Miranda et al.'s dataset, we chose English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese,\nand Slovenian. We also include Portuguese and Arabic to increase linguistic diversity. The selected languages cover\ndifferent language families (Germanic, Italic, Slavic, Semitic, and Sinitic) and are written in different scripts (Latin,\nCyrillic, Arabic, and Chinese)."}, {"title": "News collection", "content": "With the defined article criteria, we can now retrieve the relevant news articles. To do this, we use Event Registry [19],\nthe system that collects news articles from thousands of publishers, clusters them into news events, and enriches news\narticles and event clusters by extracting the named entities mentioned. It also links the article's textual components to\ncorresponding Wikipedia pages through a process called wikification [23, 24]. Due to the structure of Wikipedia, where\ndifferent-language Wikipedia pages corresponding to the same concept are linked, the wikification process identifies the\nWikipedia pages in both the article's language and in English, if available.\nThe Event Registry system has a dedicated API (https://www.newsapi. ai/), which enables the retrieval of news\narticles and event cluster metadata. The retrieval can be done through multiple endpoints, which accept various\nparameters, including the language of the article, the publication date range, and the Wikipedia concepts the articles\nmust relate to. Although the system provides clustered news articles, we used the API to collect only the news articles,\nas the clusters created by the system do not have the structure we are targeting.\nUsing the defined criteria, we developed code to retrieve the relevant articles automatically via the Event Registry API.\nWe split the time range into days, then retrieved the articles published on a given day that were written in one of the\nselected languages and contained both the 01ympic Games and Japan Wikipedia concepts, as well as at least one of\nthe sports concepts listed in the criteria definition. The API allows using English Wikipedia concepts to retrieve articles\nin other languages, eliminating the need for prior translation.\nThrough this process, we retrieved 36k articles that matched the defined criteria. In addition, some articles cover also\nconcepts not defined in the criteria, such as additional sports and issues relating to COVID. Therefore, the dataset covers\na broader range of concepts. The articles were then sent for annotation."}, {"title": "News Annotation", "content": "Once the news articles were retrieved, we proceeded with the annotation process. The goal is to annotate articles based\non the events they reported on, i.e., ensuring that articles reporting on the same event received the same annotation.\nWe first describe how we prepare and clean the retrieved news articles. Afterward, we present the annotation process,\nwhich comprises automatic news clustering and the subsequent manual annotation and evaluation."}, {"title": "News cleanup", "content": "The retrieved articles have various attributes, both original and enriched by the Event Registry. To provide only the\noriginal information, we include the following attributes: its unique ID, its title and body text, the publication datetime,\nits language, its published URL address and the name of the source publisher. We then split the articles into seven\ndatasets, each corresponding to one of the sports concepts used during the retrieval process. Each dataset is then\nprocessed in the automatic clustering and manual annotation and evaluation, in that order."}, {"title": "Automatic news clustering", "content": "We apply an online multilingual news clustering algorithm [25] to automatically cluster each dataset corresponding\nto one of the sport's concepts. This algorithm, a single-pass clustering approach, processes the collected datasets by\nrepresenting each article using its content embedding, the set of extracted named entities, and its publication datetime.\nThe content embedding is created using the SBERT [26, 27] language model, trained to generate contextual embeddings\nappropriate for pairwise sentence similarity, while the named entities were extracted using the WikiNEuRal [28]\nmultilingual named entity extraction model.\nThe representations for event clusters are created as aggregates of content embeddings, entity sets, and publication\ndatetime values of articles within the clusters. The algorithm measures the content similarity, ratio of overlapping\nentities, and temporal proximity between the article and all clusters, checking if all three values are above the set\nthresholds defined at the beginning of the clustering process. The article is placed into the best event cluster that\nmeets these criteria. If no such cluster exists, a new one is created containing the current article. The algorithm's\nhyper-parameters (thresholds) were chosen to optimize precision while maintaining a reasonable recall score. This\nintentional selection results in more clusters containing only the most similar articles, potentially reducing the inclusion\nof articles that should not be clustered together.\nThe automatic news clustering resulted in around 16k event clusters containing an average of 2-3 articles. These clusters\nare then processed through manual annotation in the next step."}, {"title": "Manual annotation and evaluation", "content": "Following the automatic news clustering process, the datasets underwent a manual evaluation and annotation process.\nEach dataset related to a sports concept was assessed using the following procedure.\nCluster representation. To represent each automatically generated cluster, a table was created to display the included\narticle values. Each table row contains the current cluster ID, the unique article ID, the article publication datetime, the\narticle language, as well as its title and body. Notably, the article's URL and source were intentionally omitted from the\ntable, as they do not contain relevant event information.\nManual annotation criteria. The annotation criteria is designed to categorize articles based on their responses to\nfundamental journalistic questions: who, what, where, when, and how. The first four questions yield objective answers,\nwhile the response to how can involve subjectivity. Because of this, alignment with the how question is considered an\noptional criterion. The annotators are tasks to group articles based on the responses to these questions. In addition,\narticles reflecting the same event from different perspectives (e.g. two articles describing the finals of a sport event,\nwhere one focuses on the gold and the other on the silver medalists) should be in the same event cluster, although they\nmight not have the same responses to the above questions.\nTo further improve the quality of the dataset, annotators are provided with additional guidelines:\n\u2022 Articles should predominantly focus on a singular event, situation, or key information.\n\u2022 Articles must avoid resembling \u201cclick-bait,\u201d meaning they should not include phrases like \u201cwatch now\" or\n\"click here to see more.\" If they do, the article should be excluded from the dataset.\n\u2022 Articles should not primarily focus on presenting a schedule of events occurring on a specific day. If they do,\nthe article should be excluded from the dataset.\nThe intentionally ambiguous criterion aims to create diverse clusters of articles in various languages. Additionally, the\ncriterion allows validation of an article based solely on its title, provided that the title is informative enough to provide\nthe correct annotation.\nManual evaluation process. Given the evaluation criteria, the annotators were tasked with reviewing the clusters and\nannotating the articles. If an annotator encountered a text that was not comprehensible, they were permitted to utilize\nmachine translation services such as Google Translate (https://translate.google.com/). Annotators had the\nflexibility to remove specific articles from the dataset, relocate articles between clusters, merge, divide, and eliminate\nentire clusters. Each action taken was recorded and contributed to the creation of the final dataset.\nAfter the manual annotation and evaluation process for all datasets, the annotated datasets underwent a joint evaluation,\nfocusing on the final annotation process that involved joining clusters reporting on the same event and removing"}, {"title": "Data Records", "content": "The OG2021 dataset consists of 10,940 news articles reporting on the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. \narticles are written in nine different languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Slovenian, Arabic and\nChinese), with the article's publication datetime spanning between July 1, 2021 and August 14, 2021."}, {"title": "Technical Validation", "content": "In addition to the manual evaluation during the news annotation process, we also performed the technical validation to\nensure the dataset indeed contains multilingual news articles within a high-frequency event setting."}, {"title": "Article distribution over time", "content": "Figure 2 illustrates the article's distribution based on their publication datetime.

Because\nof this, the dataset includes news articles that focus on the chosen sports rather than all sports at the event. For instance,\nathletics and gymnastics are less covered due to the defined retrieval conditions. Furthermore, the removal of\n\"click-bait\" and scheduling news articles significantly reduced the dataset size. These articles can introduce noise, which\ncan be useful for developing methods to effectively group news articles or identify such types.\nConsidering these potential extensions, we plan to develop similar news article datasets focusing on future Olympic\nGames, starting with the 2024 Olympics in Paris. We would expand the retrieval conditions to include more languages\nand a broader list of sports. Additionally, we would include \"click-bait\" and scheduling articles, annotating them to\nreflect their content type."}, {"title": "Usage Notes", "content": "To use the OG2021 dataset, the user must first download it from the CLARIN.SI repository [29, 30].

The algorithm would process and group the news articles into event clusters. The created event clusters\nwould then be compared with the dataset's cluster IDs to measure the algorithm's performance, which might include\nthe standard and BCubed [31] variants of the F1, precision, and recall scores, cluster purity, and normalized mutual\ninformation. The performance metrics would then show how the algorithm fares in the high-frequency event setting\npresented within the dataset.\nThe dataset can also be used to analyze the dynamics and events of the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, including cultural\ndifferences and perspectives in reporting based on news publishers and the language used.

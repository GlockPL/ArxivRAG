The CAs were designed to facilitate knowledge sharing among factory operators. Our investigation focused on smartphone-based voice assistants and LLM-powered chatbots, examining their usability and utility in a real-world factory setting. Based on the qualitative feedback we collected during the deployments of CAs at the factories, we conducted a thematic analysis to investigate the perceptions, challenges, and overall impact on workflow and knowledge sharing. Our results indicate that while CAs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency through knowledge sharing and quicker resolution of production issues, they also introduce concerns around workplace surveillance, the types of knowledge that can be shared, and shortcomings compared to human-to-human knowledge sharing.

Knowledge management is increasingly recognized as a vital discipline that involves creating, sharing, and using an organization's knowledge. As such, understanding what leads to a successful Knowledge Management System (KMS) is an important area of research [8, 21].\nThe importance of KM has motivated efforts to use technology, such as AI assistants, to support human knowledge work, a research field with over 60 years of history. Yet, the success of these systems was often held back by the knowledge acquisition bottleneck [86]\u2014capturing and maintaining human knowledge is highly resource intensive. On top of this, social factors such as the trade-off between perceived benefit and effort for the knowledge sharer pose additional challenges [43]. Domain knowledge can be complex, situational, and ephemeral, making it difficult to express and store, and it can quickly become outdated [83]. Yet, cyber-physical systems, such as Cognitive Assistants (CA), show promise in supporting knowledge management [43]. In this work, CAs are Al systems that can interact conversationally to support cognitive tasks, for example, in supporting factory operators to share knowledge and learn about problems with the production machines [45, 50].\nDue to the complexities of KM, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have had limited use in KM until recently, especially when handling unstructured texts such as manufacturing issue reports [32, 65, 70]. Prior work on using assistant systems to share knowledge in factories has focused on using NLP technologies to deliver instructions efficiently but not the capturing of knowledge. For example, Hoerner et al. [41] presented an assistant system for tacit knowledge sharing in manufacturing but still relies on human experts for the initial knowledge capture. There are examples of gamified experiences to elicit (manufacturing) knowledge; however, these have"}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "This section provides an overview of current research in Knowledge Management (KM) and the utilization of technology, specifically Cognitive Assistants (CA), to enhance knowledge sharing in organizational settings. It discusses the challenges and advancements in KM practices, the significant role of technological interventions in facilitating knowledge acquisition, dissemination, and application, and the socio-technical aspects that influence implementing these systems in manufacturing environments."}, {"title": "2.1 Knowledge Management", "content": "Organizational KM involves leveraging the knowledge of employees, customers, and suppliers [8]. This entails processes to acquire, manage, and share knowledge within an organization to achieve a competitive advantage [68]. In practice, the core tenet of KM is to \u201csave content, it will be useful later\u201d [1]. For this work, CAs were deployed to support knowledge sharing between factory operators. In the following sections, we will outline the key processes surrounding knowledge sharing when facilitated by a digital system such as a CA, namely, knowledge acquisition, sharing, and application.\nKnowledge acquisition-involves eliciting knowledge, explicating it, and formalizing it for later use [24]. Knowledge can be elicited once it has been created in the mind of an employee. Eliciting involves extracting knowledge from domain experts or sources, often through interviews, surveys, observation, or analysis of existing documentation. Elicitation can uncover both explicit and tacit knowledge, understanding not just what is known but also how it's applied in practice. In this work, we focus on explicit knowledge that can be readily expressed in words as opposed to tacit knowledge that can not [67].\nOnce knowledge has been elicited, it needs to be made explicit. Explication involves articulat-ing the knowledge clearly and understandably. This may involve defining terms and organizing information into coherent structures. Explication helps ensure that knowledge is comprehensible to others and can be effectively communicated.\nFinally, during formalization, knowledge is structured and represented in a formal language or framework. Formalization makes knowledge more precise and facilitates analysis and manipulation by digital systems. This might involve creating models, rules, ontologies, or other formal knowledge representations. Formalization helps facilitate (AI) reasoning and decision-making based on the captured knowledge.\nKnowledge sharing\u2014is defined as the process of transferring knowledge between individuals, groups, or organizations [3]. Once knowledge has been acquired, it can be shared with others who can benefit from it. Traditionally, this can be done through various channels such as documenta-tion, training sessions, workshops, seminars, meetings, or digital platforms. While many of these strategies aim to stimulate face-to-face knowledge sharing, organizations are also interested in systems that formalize the knowledge. This ensures that the knowledge persists beyond employees' memory and facilitates sharing at scale and asynchronously. In this work, we explore using CAs that act as an intermediary to help efficiently share newly created knowledge.\nKnowledge application\u2014is when knowledge is used to solve problems and make informed decisions to profit the organization [72]. This involves analyzing the situation, identifying relevant knowledge, and applying it effectively to address the issue at hand. In the context of this work, the CAs contribute primarily to the process of identifying and retrieving relevant knowledge. Analyzing the situation and taking action is still largely up to the human operator.\nKnowledge management systems typically face many human, organizational, and technical challenges, such as employees hiding their knowledge to maintain (perceived) power or inefficient"}, {"title": "2.2 Knowledge Sharing Systems", "content": "Designing KS systems requires consideration of a broad range of factors, often intertwined with so-cial and human elements. Organizations across various sectors have developed their own dedicated KS systems. For instance, the 'Inside IBM' project used AI, information systems, and user-centered design to aggregate IBM's accumulated product support knowledge into a single system [60]. Siemens employs TechnoWeb for social collaboration, which leverages a combination of social networking tools, collaborative platforms, and knowledge repositories to facilitate the sharing and management of expertise across the organization [48]. TechnoWeb integrates features such as discussion forums, expert directories, and document sharing to create a dynamic and interac-tive environment for knowledge exchange. NASA uses the Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS)2 to document and share project experiences. LLIS employs a structured database approach, where lessons are systematically categorized, indexed, and made searchable to ensure that critical insights from past projects are easily accessible for future missions [53]. This system includes detailed metadata tagging, cross-referencing of related lessons, and a review process to validate the accuracy and relevance of the information. Furthermore, the enhanced version of LLIS that the Goddard Space Flight Center uses employs an 'active' push feature to recommend lessons that match the knowledge needs of specific individuals. These diverse systems illustrate the various methods employed to manage and leverage knowledge within organizations, ranging from searchable lessons learned and social collaboration tools to active knowledge recommendations and systematic documentation processes.\nSeveral factors contribute to the success of KS systems, as exemplified by the cases of Google, Toy-ota, and Xerox's Eureka project described below. In the case of Google, they emphasize psychological safety for KS [30]. Toyota-perhaps KM's most renowned manufacturing success story-employs network-level knowledge-sharing processes. These processes effectively engaged members in shar-ing critical knowledge, deterring free-riding behavior, and minimizing the obstacles to locating and obtaining valuable knowledge [31]. The Eureka project at Xerox showcases the successful use of technology to gather, validate, and share best practices across their customer service engineers [15]. By involving customer service engineers throughout the design process and encouraging local champions to support adoption and feedback, Xerox contributed to the project's success [10]. Ultimately, the Eureka project is said to have saved Xerox $100 million [10, 15]. Overall, these cases highlight the importance of minimizing the burden on knowledge contributors, ensuring high knowledge quality, and involving end-users throughout the design process to address their needs."}, {"title": "2.3 Integrating Al in Knowledge Sharing Systems", "content": "While Eureka was an early example of an online knowledge base that service engineers could manually record and retrieve reports about machine problems, expert systems were the first widely used Al systems to reason over a knowledge base to support human decision-making. Using AI assistants for KM has progressed significantly from early expert systems in the 1970s, such as Dendral [54] and MYCIN [81], which were designed to answer questions in specific domains based on rules defined by domain experts. In recent years, the improvements in natural language processing and deep learning have given rise to more sophisticated AI assistants, such as IBM's Watson [40]."}, {"title": "2.4 Cognitive Assistants for Factory Operators", "content": "In recent years, research into AI assistants in manufacturing has increased, taking advantage of recent advancements in NLP and the proliferation of IoT to support decision-making, operationally efficiency, and training [19, 20, 23, 39, 41, 46, 73, 84]). Although the social and human aspects are largely missing [39], they have been receiving increasing attention as demonstrated by the recent paradigm of Industry 5.0 where human well-being is key [14, 94]. In the following sections, we discuss research on AI assistants in manufacturing, the use of knowledge bases, knowledge acquisition from humans for knowledge sharing, and the associated socio-technical challenges."}, {"title": "2.5 Al Assistants", "content": "In factories, human operators collaborating with AI assistants can be viewed as a socio-technical system consisting of the operator, the operator's tasks in the factory, and the technology enabling the assistant [57]. AI assistants can help operators fix problems with the machines or set them up optimally by enabling efficient information retrieval, remote machine control, decision support,"}, {"title": "2.6 Knowledge-intensive Al Assistants", "content": "The knowledge bases and rules that inform AI assistants in manufacturing are usually static, having been defined by a domain expert during development [19, 75, 85, 91]. Some systems use live data but are focused on presenting the status of production systems and perform (limited) reasoning over the data [6, 52, 58, 71, 74]. For example, Casillo et al. [19] presents a chatbot for training new operators based on a predefined curriculum, obtaining promising results. Baldauf et al. [6] deployed smartwatches that notified operators of machine errors, citing the importance of concise information display. Additionally, the chatbot demonstrated by Trappey et al. [85] utilizes VR to deliver knowledge in response to FAQs (frequently asked questions). Overall, existing research on AI assistants focused on understanding how to deliver knowledge or present (live) information to operators but not acquire knowledge from operators."}, {"title": "2.7 Cognitive Assistants: Acquiring and Sharing Human Knowledge", "content": "In the context of this study, Cognitive Assistants (CAs) are an advanced type of AI assistant that interacts conversationally to acquire knowledge from humans and share it with other humans, supporting decision-making. Cognition refers to the mental processes of acquiring and comprehending knowledge [4], which the CA aims to support. To do so effectively, a CA can use several technologies, including dialogue management, NLP, context awareness, databases, and ontologies. While deploying CAs at a production line appears novel, we discuss notable works that evaluated (parts of) the underlying technologies and techniques in the following sections.\nAcquiring knowledge using conversational AI and/or mobile devices has been explored and shown to be promising. For example, Fenoglio et al. [34] introduced a role-playing game involving virtual agents, human experts, and knowledge engineers to refine knowledge graphs that were algorithmically generated. The authors raised several important ethical concerns regard-ing the processing of personally identifying data, deciding to avoid audio and video recordings, and other concerns regarding misuse of employee monitoring. Hoerner et al. [41] built a digital assistance system to support operator troubleshooting processes on the shop floor using captured knowledge. While they allowed operators to suggest edits, knowledge engineers still performed the initial knowledge capture process. In contrast, Hannola et al. [39] deployed smartphone applications for factory operators to take notes and videos of solutions to production line problems themselves, thus enabling other operators to access newly created knowledge. While this work highlighted the potential of facilitating KS through digital technologies, it did not investigate the application of LLMs and/or conversational AI."}, {"title": "2.8 Socio-technical Challenges", "content": "While many KMS have been deployed in manufacturing, the human potential for knowledge sharing and the associated social factors have been largely overlooked [39]. Work in factories is socio-technical rather than purely technical, deterministic activities [47, 63]. While it is clear that digital tools can facilitate knowledge sharing among users, for example, by enabling factory operators to post comments under existing work instructions to facilitate discussion about best practices [56], these tools can have many unforeseen social effects and barriers. For example, introducing relatively simple tools, such as a machine repair ticketing system, can shift the balance of control towards or away from operators depending on who is given privileges to create, view, and modify tickets [47]. Furthermore, operators omitted their valuable informal knowledge when asked to create learning material collaboratively in favor of the standard working procedures [89]. Additionally, requiring operators to use smartphones to document their work can be perceived as controlling [39]. Thus, these factors emphasize the importance of considering social factors when introducing new digital knowledge sharing practices, which are generally overlooked when designing AI assistant systems [18].\nTo tackle the complex social challenges discussed above, it is crucial to look beyond the technical aspects when developing AI tools for knowledge sharing. Although not social in nature, consid-ering human-computer interaction factors such as avoiding information overload and ensuring the information needs are met on an individual level are also key [43]. Indeed, recent work on assistance systems for sharing tacit knowledge in factories that had focused on technological aspects emphasized the importance of comprehensively evaluating the social, psychological, and organizational implications [41]. The crucial importance of socio-technical factors is what moti-vated us to holistically reflect on the feedback we received from operators and managers while deploying CAs, culminating in this study."}, {"title": "3 REAL-WORLD CASE STUDIES IN FACTORIES", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Approach and Context", "content": "We conducted a hybrid deductive/inductive thematic analysis of 251 comments collected from operators and factory management over two years of CA evaluations at two factories in two European countries. The factories manufactured detergents on production lines that could rapidly switch between over a hundred detergent types depending on customer demand. The factories operated 24/7 with three eight-hour shifts per day, and each production line was typically manned by two operators. The operators reconfigure, operate, and resolve issues with the production lines, all knowledge-intensive tasks, especially considering the frequent production and quality issues. We evaluated four CAs of varying levels of sophistication and functionality, from technology probes simulated by researchers to CA systems connected to a live production line, allowing us to explore many facets of the operators's experiences. This research was approved by the factory operators' councils and our institution's human research ethics committee."}, {"title": "3.2 Systems, Protocols, and Participants", "content": "The development of the CAs used in this study was initiated according to objectives set by the factory management: to increase production performance and reduce training time by supporting (tacit) knowledge sharing amongst operators and training operators to follow standardized procedures. The factory management had observed significant disparities between operator shift performance, poor adherence to standard working procedures, and inefficient human-human knowledge sharing practices. Despite the top-down initiation of the project, we involved the operators throughout the development and evaluation of the system to ensure that we were also meeting their needs and values. The evaluated functions are listed in Table 1 and participants in Table 2. In the following sections, we describe four phases of data collection, including the capabilities of the CAs, data collection protocols, and participant information."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Phase One: Technology Probe during Production Line Operations", "content": "In preparation for the first evaluation phase (Jan. 2021-May 2021), we asked the operators (n=2) and their managers (n=2) to describe the current knowledge management practices at the factory. Together, we defined the information needed to represent an operator's knowledge regarding issue handling, namely, the symptoms, machine component(s) associated with the symptom, type of issue, location, current task, solution, and root cause analysis. During the first phase of evaluations, we used a technology probe [11] to evaluate the user experience of using a CA for capturing knowledge at the production line. Over three days, in May 2021, we asked factory operators to share how they solved issues with a CA being simulated by a researcher. Participants used a Bluetooth headset to interact verbally whilst at the production line. The researcher simulated the CA using a protocol representing state-of-the-art NLU and dialogue management. The protocol followed a form-filling conversation during which the operator was asked to describe the issue according to the abovementioned representation."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Phase Two: CA with a Simulated Production Line", "content": "Having learned the importance of efficient and reliable interactions from the first phase of evaluations, we developed a CA that used live data from a simulated production line and human location tracking using stereoscopic cameras\u00b3 for context awareness.

In addition to context-aware user interactions, the data was used to provide ML recommendations and generate statistics and graphical representations of the production line performance.\nAs factory operators faced many problems during an 8-hour shift, it was challenging to capture all relevant new knowledge in a timely manner. Furthermore, when the factory operators were asked to look back on their shifts and prepare a summary for the next shift, it was challenging to remember all relevant events and information. To support reflections on the shift, we integrated a function to display statistics and visualizations of production performance over time. This served as an overview and memory prompt for the operators to look over.\nFactory management had observed large discrepancies between the production speeds achieved by operators. Indeed, many operators were not aware of the speeds achieved by their colleagues for each product and what explained the difference. We trained a Random Forest (RF) classifier on historical data to provide recommendations in an effort to support operators in achieving higher production speeds. The output consisted of speed adjustment recommendations, namely increase, decrease, or no action. The recommendations were accompanied by a textual explanation based on the model features used, for example, \u201cI recommend increasing speed as the last canister weight"}, {"title": "3.2.4 Phase Four: LLM-powered Cognitive Assistant", "content": "During the final evaluations, we tested the LLM-powered functions exclusively, using the gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model API, LlamaIndex10 for the response generation and Gradio11 for the browser-based frontend. The LLM-powered system introduced the following new functions: RAG for user queries, a digital form for submitting issue analysis reports, automatic validation of submitted root-cause analysis reports, human validation of submitted root-cause analysis reports, and a function to upload new operating documentation.\nThe RAG feature enables factory operators to quickly get advice for issues or procedural issues they are facing by chatting with the CA. The CA retrieves information from two separate knowledge bases: standard operating documentation and operator-submitted issue analysis reports. We opted to keep these separate in the CA's response, so it is clear to the operator what the source of information is (See Figure 3b). Additionally, the operators can click on a drop-down menu to inspect the reference material directly.\nIn another tab of the interface, operators can fill out and submit issue analysis reports. We followed the standard practices of the factories by including fields for location, issue description, (root-)cause, and solution. As operators often struggled to find the root cause of issues, we included optional fields to conduct a 5-why analysis for root-cause identification [78]. Upon completion of the report, an LLM prompt is used to automatically validate the logic of the reasoning steps and consistencies with existing knowledge in the knowledge base. Finally, an employee with adminstrator powers can approve the report, inserting it into the knowledge base for future use.\nWe evaluated the LLM-powered CA with three (n=3) operators and one (n=1) manager from the first factory, and four (n=4) managers and five (n=5) operators from the second factory. The evaluation in the first factory was conducted in person at a production line, with one researcher coordinating the evaluation and conducting the interview and a second researcher recording audio and taking notes. Conversely, the evaluation in the second factory was conducted asynchronously without the presence of a researcher. The operators and managers from the second factory were provided with an online survey that specified the tasks and open-ended questions that were used to extract the comments. The tasks for both factories aimed to evaluate the knowledge capture and sharing capabilities of the CAs with recent issues from their work. For example, we instructed the participants to ask for help with recent problems they faced on the production line. Similarly, we asked them to record a solution and their thought process for a problem they recently faced. After completing the tasks, the open-ended questions for both factories included the following topics: the perceived benefits, risks, adoption barriers, operator-management relations, and suggestions for improvements, resulting in 118 (nc=118) comments."}, {"title": "3.3 Hybrid Deductive/Inductive Thematic Analysis", "content": "After several rounds of qualitative data collection over two years, we conducted a hybrid de-ductive/inductive thematic analysis with two independent coders as described by Fereday and Muir-Cochrane [35] and recently applied by Martinez-Maldonado et al.

Specifically, the system provides greater speed in carrying out some small tasks (P29), it has a well-set-up logical control function (P30), and helps solving problems quickly (P8*, P24, P25, and P37) as stated here \"I find it nice that you can look back.

These comments show that participants generally see it as a mechanism for experts to share their knowledge with novices and as a memory augmentation for themselves.\nThat said, there are concerns that receiving information from the system could be less quick, effective, and comprehensive than asking the expert staff present (P27). This is likely true, assuming that there is an expert present with the relevant knowledge. However, our observations at the production line and statements by operators, such as \u201cA few hours are lost every week on previously solved issues.\u201d (P33) and P34 stated that operators \u201cLose about half an hour per day over one team per line.\u201d suggests that information on previously solved issues was not readily available.\nWhereas management believes in standardizing approaches so every operator operates at the highest achievable performance, some operators do not think this is feasible.

{"title": "Gradient Descent Efficiency Index", "authors": ["Aviral Dhingra"], "abstract": "Gradient descent is a widely used iterative algorithm for finding local minima in multivariate functions. However, the final iterations often either overshoot the minima or make minimal progress, making it challenging to determine an optimal stopping point. This study introduces a new efficiency metric, Ek, designed to quantify the effectiveness of each iteration. The proposed metric accounts for both the relative change in error and the stability of the loss function across iterations. This measure is particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments, where costs are closely tied to training time. Experimental validation across multiple datasets and models demonstrates that Ek provides valuable insights into the convergence behavior of gradient descent, complementing traditional performance metrics. The index has the potential to guide more informed decisions in the selection and tuning of optimization algorithms in machine learning applications and be used to compare the \"effectiveness\" of models relative to each other.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the field of machine learning, optimizing the training process of models is crucial for achieving high performance while minimizing computational resources.

The proposed index captures both the relative reduction in error and the stability of the loss function, offering a more nuanced assessment of gradient descent performance compared to traditional metrics. By providing a finer-grained measure of effi- ciency, Ek enables more informed decisions in the selection and adjustment of optimization techniques in machine learning.\nThe experimental validation demonstrates that Ek is a robust metric that correlates well with final accuracy and can highlight inefficiencies in the optimization process. Future work will focus on extending the experimental validation of Ek across a broader range of optimization algorithms, including those with adaptive learning rates and second-order methods. Ad- ditionally, the application of Ek to other optimization problems, such as those involving non-smooth or stochastic loss functions, will be explored. The idea of a \"golden number of iterations\" or a function that produces the same given a set of parameters can also be explored with this index."}]}

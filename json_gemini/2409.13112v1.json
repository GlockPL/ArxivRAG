Technologies like computer vision, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and internet of things (IoT) are increasingly integrated into waste processing to achieve these goals. While deep learning (DL) models show promise in recognising homogeneous C&DW piles, few studies assess their performance with mixed, highly contaminated material in commercial settings. Drawing on extensive experience at a C&DW materials recovery facility (MRF) in Sydney, Australia, we explore the challenges and opportunities in developing an advanced automated mixed C&DW management system. We begin with an overview of the evolution of waste management in the construction industry, highlighting its environmental, economic, and societal impacts. We review various C&DW analysis techniques, concluding that DL-based visual methods are the optimal solution. Additionally, we examine the progression of sensor and camera technologies for C&DW analysis as well as the evolution of DL algorithms focused on object detection and material segmentation. We also discuss C&DW datasets, their curation, and innovative methods for their creation. Finally, we share insights on C&DW visual analysis, addressing technical and commercial challenges, research trends, and future directions for mixed C&DW analysis. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of C&DW management by providing valuable insights for ongoing and future research and development efforts in this critical sector.", "sections": [{"title": "I. Introduction", "content": "Deep learning (DL) based technologies are transforming industries such as energy, health, defence, agriculture, manufacturing, and construction. The construction sector plays a significant role in the global economy, contributing around 10 trillion US dollars annually to gross domestic product (GDP). The development of new tools and equipment, including mobile applications (Apps), hyperspectral sensors, autonomous heavy equipment, drones, robots, and augmented and virtual reality, is projected to increase GDP to 14 trillion by 2025 [1]. This activity also consumes roughly half of the world's raw materials extracted yearly, contributing to an estimated one-third of the world's overall waste and 39% of carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, approximately one-half to three-quarters of annual material input is returned to the environment as waste within one year [2]. Counteracting this has created an increasing demand for recycled materials, prompted by consumer movements towards improved environmental sustainability, global supply chain uncertainty, decarbonisation, climate, and regulatory changes. These are driving rapid technological developments in waste recycling [3, 4]. Recycling is a broad research and development topic. In this paper, we focus mainly on construction and demolition waste (C&DW) recycling, paying special attention to the complex problem of mixed C&DW recycling in a commercial setting.\nIdentifying the types of waste in the waste stream has been a significant obstacle in improving the recycling rate (proportion of materials recycled or recovered). Cameras are a popular and practical choice for automatically recognising C&DW due to their cost-effectiveness and availability. Challenges to successful implementation for commercial use include varying accuracy, lack of high-quality datasets for training, heterogeneous nature of construction waste and dynamic nature of construction sites. DL models for recognition and classification of C&DW show promising results with high levels of accuracy; however, these are usually trained on datasets without complex backgrounds or heterogeneity of source material [5, 6].\nEven with the best cameras, automatic material recognition for real-world applications is complex [7]. Categories of materials such as wood, brick, concrete, tile, and metal can span a diverse range of appearances. Some types are often smooth and featureless, presenting a challenge for image-based feature identification [8]. Low image resolution can hinder the detection of small objects. Objects can be deformed, contaminated, overlapped, incomplete, or obscured by other materials. Waste streams can be highly variable, including a wide range of materials and contaminants, making generalisation across different sorting scenarios or locations difficult. Real-world sorting or transfer centres can be harsh, with physical and environmental factors influencing accuracy. Sensor degradation can occur due to high dust, debris and moisture levels, lighting variability and interference from other systems and equipment, for example, vibration, affecting performance [9].\nThis review is motivated by our team's strong interest and real-world experience in DL-based research and development at a C&DW facility in Australia. We have identified a gap in the literature on the real-world use of DL for mixed C&DW recognition. We observed that this domain is limited to discrete, largely homogenous piles or analysis of mixed waste on conveyor belt feeds. In Australia, most companies use skip bins to collect C&DW material (Figure 1). A top-down or surface assessment can be problematic. Bins may have lighter material, such as pallets, stacked on top of heavier mixed waste [10, 11]. Relying on surface features alone may also introduce bias; contractors may load trucks in a particular way depending on accessibility to the waste or the demolition stage [12]."}, {"title": "II. Overview of waste management evolution and impact in the construction industry", "content": "Recycling of C&DW has occurred for centuries. For example, the Romans were known to repurpose stone, brick and tile to obtain material later reused in the same locality or transported to other regions within the empire [13]. Limited space available for new landfills, existing ones reaching capacity, accompanied by better waste management practices and increasing costs due to increased regulations and environmental standards, has resulted in more governments implementing zero waste concepts and alternative waste management strategies into urban development planning and infrastructure [14].\nC&DW recycling was initially introduced in the early 1970s in some regions of the United States and Europe, where resources for concrete were scarce [15]. An increasing number of plants for recycling and sorting went into operation in the 1980s; however, in most European countries, C&DW recycling remained a relatively new industry into the early 1990s [16]. During the 1980s, the industry saw technological advancements in sorting and separation, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective processing. These included mechanical sorting systems (conveyor belts, screens, and crushers to separate material based on size and weight), Eddy current separation (magnetic fields to separate metals from non-metallic materials), air classification (material separation based on density and aerodynamic properties), and improved hand sorting for manual separation [17, 18].\nThroughout the 1990s, governments worldwide introduced laws and regulations to reduce waste sent to landfills and promote using recycled materials. Recycling paper, glass, aluminium, ferrous, and selected plastics became more common [19]. Automated sorting systems became more prevalent, reducing manual labour requirements and increasing the speed and accuracy of sorting processes [20]. The integration of computers into sorting operations allowed for real-time monitoring and control of sorting processes, as well as the collection and analysis of data to optimise operations [21]. Advanced sensors, such as near-infrared and robotics, have also become more widespread and are starting to be applied in C&DW recycling [22]."}, {"title": "B. Environmental, economic, and societal impacts of C&DW management", "content": "Improper C&DW management affects not only developing countries but also developed nations. It creates negative environmental impacts, including soil, water, and air contamination, natural resource consumption, and ecological degradation [23]. Pollution is a growing threat to public health; it is the world's largest cause of disease and premature death, three times more than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Over the past two decades, deaths caused by modern pollution have increased by 66%, driven by industrialisation, uncontrolled urbanisation, population growth and fossil fuels [24].\nDespite the high potential for recycling, landfilling remains the most common disposal method. The environmental impact of C&DW is estimated to increase by 20.2% by 2025 if business- as-usual landfilling continues. These can be reduced by an estimated 33.2% and 46% if recycling rates improve to 50% and 100%, respectively. Changing construction methodology, reducing the distance to MRFs, reducing waste generations at-site and maximising C&DW recycling can further reduce environmental impact. These changes need to be supported by policy, legislation and infrastructure, which is difficult when construction waste classification varies across countries due to differences in regulations, cultural attitudes, initiatives, best practice examples and targets for waste and resource efficiency [25]."}, {"title": "2. Economic", "content": "In conventional linear economies, C&DW waste is considered zero-value material, most ending in landfills. Increased awareness around sustainability and resource management has led to adopting a circular economy, a model of production and consumption that involves reducing, reusing, recovering or recycling raw materials. A study of seven European nations found that adopting circular economies would reduce greenhouse emissions by 70% and increase the workforce by 4% [26]. A cost-benefit analysis of diverting demolition waste from a landfill for a new housing project in New Zealand found that apart from the economic savings, benefits included jobs for deconstruction efforts, social benefits from training, and reduced unwanted noise and traffic pollution [27].\nIn some jurisdictions, C&DW is legally required to be managed locally (i.e., treatment, recycling, and landfilling at local facilities). Some regions may transport C&DW to other areas for further processing or disposal. In Australia, because of the differences in waste levies between the States and the availability of facilities, a considerable portion of C&DW is transported across states. Some C&DW is transported from NSW to Queensland for landfilling; South Australia has become the recycling centre that receives the metals, plastics, and glass waste from other states, such as Victoria, Western Australia, and Northern Territory [28]. Cost disparity between states results in increased transportation and the risk of increased illegal dumping [29]."}, {"title": "3. Societal", "content": "Societal approaches to increased C&DW have included the introduction of Waste Hierarchy as a simple ranking system used for different waste management options and the introduction of incentive schemes to promote sustainable construction (Green Building and Green Star Certification programs) [30, 31]. Although recycling is challenging for all countries, some European countries report higher recycling rates [32]. Among EU countries, levels of C&DW, as a percentage of the total C&DW waste stream, vary from less than 10% (Greece) to more than 95% (Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Italy). Germany is the country that recycles the most (88%) within the EU. The main fractions in the US are concrete (73.7%), concrete asphaltic (15.3%), and wood (7.1%). The remaining fractions are plaster products, steel, ceramics, and asphaltic tiles. Generally, most countries have had declining trends in waste generation over the last decade [33].\nMethodological differences in collection and reporting with a lack of benchmarking standards across different economies lead to significant variations between countries [34]. Developing a universal DL model for commercial and academic applications is hindered by various barriers such as differences in waste composition, regulations, data bias, terminologies, recycling facilities infrastructure, technology, and the presence of materials that are not uniformly used in the construction industry of some countries, for example, bamboo [35]."}, {"title": "III. Compositional and quantitative C&DW analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Statistical analysis", "content": "Early attempts to analyse construction waste in the literature include spreadsheet models using waste produced per capita to forecast waste generation [36]. Subsequently, methods were developed based on the financial value of the building permits [37] and or area of the construction [38]. Various direct and indirect methods have been proposed to analyse C&DW based on pile shape, directly weighing fractions (classifying, weighing and calculating the percentage of total), contractor components records, or through formulas requiring basic information obtainable from waste hauling tickets [39, 40]. Quantification methodologies include site visits, waste generation methods, lifetime analysis, classification system accumulation method, variables modelling and others such as a fixed percentage, purchased materials or chemical characteristics [41]."}, {"title": "B. Traditional image and sensory analysis", "content": "Image analysis was also considered as a means of C&DW composition analysis. The main principle in this analysis was that all objects have a series of visual characteristics, such as shape, size, pattern, and texture, which can be used to differentiate. An early analysis method, the dot grid approach, comprised a set of dots superimposed on a digital image. The sum of the dots intersecting the object of interest divided by the total number of dots, was then computed as an estimation of the area occupied by the object [42]. This approach to mixed waste was influenced by the density values for each material; it required the C&DW to be spread evenly (generally no greater than 30cm) [43]. Other traditional C&DW image and sensory analysis approaches included fluorescence, microwave frequency measurement, ultrasound and X-ray imaging [44]."}, {"title": "C. Big data and predictive analytics", "content": "The proliferation of digital cameras, particularly smartphones, has led to a growing interest in using images to conduct rapid, low-cost compositional analysis at the point of contact (weighbridge, MRF floor) [45]. There is increasing interest in big data to understand latent trends (exploratory and descriptive analytics) and to forecast future events [46]. A big data- probability model (BD-P), developed using 4.27 million truckloads of construction waste, was used to quickly and accurately estimate C&DW composition using two inputs (waste weight and volume). Results yielded a model accuracy of 90.2% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8775 with an inference speed of around 52 seconds per load [47].\nDespite the promise of big data, its benefits are yet to be seen in the construction waste management community [48]. Problems with big data construction waste analytics (CWA) include changing definitions of big data; what was considered big in the 1990s may be considered small today. Increasing need for higher-performance computation, large-scale data storage and access to real-time processing are other problems. Data quality may also be influenced by contractors recording the appropriate details, varying methods in data collection such as observation, questionnaires, sorting, weighing, truckload recording and the temporary nature of construction projects [49]. These make visual assessment a tedious and error-prone task that can benefit from deep learning-based computer vision, which is the main focus of this paper and will be discussed in detail."}, {"title": "IV. Evolution of camera and sensor technology for C&DW analysis", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for more resilient and sustainable supply chains. The use of digital technologies, including machine learning, has started to play a more prominent role in C&DW management. Computer vision (CV) stands out for its cost- effectiveness, ease of maintenance, ability to be deployed on the edge and mobile devices and applicability to a wide range of materials in real-time [50]."}, {"title": "A. Integration of early CV technologies", "content": "CV endeavours to teach machines to interpret and comprehend visual information like the human visual system. This entails crafting algorithms to extract valuable insights, patterns, and information from digital images or videos. In 1989, a breakthrough in computer vision was made when convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were introduced to categorise low- resolution images of handwritten digits. CNNs were the focus of significant research in the 1990s but fell out of fashion with the rise of support vector machines (SVMs) [51]. The basic understanding of visual information analysis in the 1990s remained poor. Advances in the field had mainly been in technology (sensors, processors, memory, storage) and not algorithms; translational research into practice was slow [52]."}, {"title": "1. Pixel, edge and feature-based C&DW detection", "content": "As early as 2002, edge detector algorithms were used to detect pixels that belong to the target object (concrete, steel, timber, aluminium) by comparing the RGB value of the pixel with the RGB range of the material from which the target is made. Once the edges have been detected, the pixels were grouped inside them to form an object [53]. In 2010, the detection of concrete in construction site images relied upon predefined colour/texture value ranges for material recognition with varying thresholds. With manual colour and texture features, automatic concrete detection correctly identified concrete using neural networks and SVMs with an average precision and recall of around 80%. Missing classification of small regions (< 200 pixels) occurred as part of the pre-processing and image segmentation process [54].\nIn 2014, accuracies of greater than 97.1% were obtained using the SVM classifier on images from the Construction Materials Library (20 typical construction classes) for high-quality 200 x 200-pixel colour images. It averaged above 90% for small 30x30 pixels and 92% for highly compressed, low-quality images under real-world conditions, improving upon previous results of 70% [55]. The performance of handcrafted features became saturated with object detection and reached a plateau after 2010. Small gains were obtained by building ensemble systems or employing minor variants of successful methods [56]."}, {"title": "B. Sensors", "content": "Several types of cameras and other sensors have been used for C&DW object recognition with varying levels of success, including RGB (red-green-blue), RGB-depth, RGB-depth point cloud, stereo, thermal, 3D and hyperspectral devices."}, {"title": "1. RBG-depth cameras", "content": "RGB cameras are the most widely used visual sensors in many applications. In many scenarios, they provide enough information for a DL model to perform a recognition task properly. Sometimes, these cameras are complimented with other sensors, such as depth cameras. In material recovery facilities, dust may cover object surfaces, reducing camera recognition accuracy. Adding depth information, which is not easily affected by dust, colour, or lighting changes, may improve detection rates. However, in one model using laser line scanning for depth information, classification accuracy was only modestly increased by 1.92 ~ 2.27% [57].\nA further problem for RBG cameras in C&DW identification is heterogeneous sample composition with a single category. Wood, for example, can be derived from natural or engineered sources. Phenotypically similar materials such as aerated, lightweight and porous concrete may have different optical properties. Similar-looking materials, such as natural aggregates, have higher water adsorption with a lower grain strength than concrete [58]. Therefore, these similarly looking materials cannot be easily identified by visible spectrum (i.e., RGB) cameras and depth information will not be helpful either. Other sensors that unlock information about the composition of materials may be needed."}, {"title": "2. Near-infrared", "content": "Near-infrared (NIR; wavelengths from 700 to 2500 nm) spectroscopy measures changes in molecular vibrations upon absorption of infrared (IR) light to gain information about the chemical composition of a sample [59]. NIR may improve plastic identification compared to standard image identification but may have some shortcomings, particularly in identifying black materials, as these are less distinguishable. Adding NIR spectral recognition increases the cost and complexity of systems. In the context of C&DW, many inorganic substances in construction waste do not contain distinct functional groups absorption spectra, making NIR spectroscopy difficult without initial pre-processing of the spectral curve [60]."}, {"title": "3. Hyperspectral imaging", "content": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging rapid and non-destructive technology that may have promising applications for the identification of C&DW. HSI may be advantageous over NIR as it integrates spectroscopic and visible imaging techniques into one system, providing spectral and spatial information simultaneously [61]. It has been used to separate different types of plastics in municipal solid wastes and to recover and recycle concrete, mortar aggregates, bricks, tiles and wood [62]. HIS images are costly due to the complicated apparatus required to acquire a wide continuous spectrum. Still, they are also more robust to solar reflections, a significant concern for RGB cameras. Reconstruction of HIS from single RGB images using CNN algorithms offers a portable, low-cost alternative [63], which can be adopted in the C&DW domain but requires significant research and development."}, {"title": "4. Multi-sensor fusion", "content": "The composition of C&DW may be complex, resulting in equally complex spectral features obtained from NIR or HIS techniques. In such cases, multi-sensor fusion and the internet of things (IoT) may provide agile solutions for classification and real-time monitoring of municipal solid waste (MSW) [64]. Such techniques may also be introduced into the C&DW recognition. Emerging 5G and 6G networks enable IoT infrastructure that will allow higher resolution images and integration of wireless sensor networks to track the C&DW at the source and direct it to the appropriate MRF [65]."}, {"title": "5. Others", "content": "Other sensors that can be fused for C&DW recognition include infrared, ultrasonic, line and laser scanning, weight and chemical. Lidar sensor fusion leverages detailed 3D information, whereas ultrasonic can provide high precision distance measurement capability to improve waste sorting and efficiency [66]. Combining multiple sensors can provide a more comprehensive understanding of waste streams. However, it can be expensive to integrate into existing infrastructure and may be subject to calibration, data synchronisation and complexity or processing issues. Algorithms using sensor fusion can require significant technical expertise. Sound recognition, metal detection and weight were used to detect glass and metal in trash bases based on spectrograms in highly controlled circumstances with an accuracy of 98% [67]; however, this is impractical for a large MRF."}, {"title": "V. Evolution of deep learning algorithms for visual C&DW analysis", "content": "In recent years, numerous studies have focused on utilising various DL models for near real- time detection of a wide range of C&DW materials. This section reviews the evolution of the literature over the past five years, as summarised in Table 1, which details the key factors involved in developing DL models for C&DW analysis. These factors include the types of C&DW materials covered, the sensors and cameras used, DL methods and models, application settings, image resolution, and the development datasets employed."}, {"title": "A. Related work", "content": "Earlier work, specifically related to deep learning, evolved from the encouraging results with single-label classification of C&DW material in bins. In one study [10] an accuracy of 94% was obtained using a VGG-16 model for both single and mixed classes of C&DW. The authors also incorporated the developed CNN model into a hypothetical case study, demonstrating its potential use in a circular C&DW business model. Limitations of these results from the possible bias, due to the limited number of images were noted, raising questions about its commercial viability. In an attempt to address this, a subsequent study [70] expanded a dataset of 2836 to 50,992 images with data augmentation techniques and transfer learning, testing four different VGG architectures and training methods, achieving an average ROC of 87.0% accuracy.\nIn a short space of time, driven by the increasing speed of object detection algorithms and the need for real-time sorting, classification has given way to object detection and segmentation algorithms. Mask region-based CNN (R-CNN) was able to precisely identify various kinds of objects with diverse shapes and colours, even under complex lighting conditions and with different backgrounds using RGB-Depth cameras and 3D lidar with mean average precision mAP for box detection and segmentation approximately 0.66 and 0.68, respectively [71]. Classifying materials from 15 to 25 meters was challenging for RGB cameras. Studies progressed to using additional sensor systems [22]."}, {"title": "B. Advancements in DL-based object detection for C&DW analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "1. Early applications of DL-based object detection in C&DW analysis", "content": "DL networks have undergone several key architectural developments to enable real-time C&DW analysis. Region-based detectors (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN) pioneered two-stage detection processes. They remained unsuitable for real-time object identification [93]. Faster R-CNN has been implemented in several C&DW projects, including detecting nails and screws [91], evaluation on synthetic C&DW dataset creation [77] and real time C&DW detection [78]. These models reached sensible outcomes in controlled situations. However, the slow inference speeds (candidate region extraction takes 2 to 3 seconds) and the single image detection time of 0.32 seconds made Faster R-CNNs challenging to deploy for real-time applications [94].\nThe development of single-stage DL neural networks such as SSD (single shot detector) and YOLO (you only look once) has dramatically improved the commercial viability of DL-based object detection algorithms [95]. Their faster inference speeds mean real-time or near-real-time performance that greatly enhances integration with technologies that require real-time or low- latency processing, such as robotics. Single-stage detectors have relatively lower computational requirements, making them more suitable for deployment on resource- constrained devices like embedded systems, drones and mobile or edge devices. The ability to run efficiently on these platforms expands the range of commercial applications for C&DW management [72]. We, therefore, discuss these next and review how they have advanced the landscape of C&DW analysis."}, {"title": "2. YOLO (You Only Look Once)", "content": "YOLO was a paradigm shift in CV technology for object detection. Its focus on real-time performance demonstrated that object detection did not have to be a slow, computationally intensive process. This unlocked a plethora of real-world applications where speed is crucial. Successive iterations of YOLO continue to improve performance and accuracy. YOLOv1 pioneered single-shot object detection but struggled with small objects and had lower accuracy than two-stage detectors. YOLOv2 and YOLO9000 introduced anchor boxes, multi-scale training and batch normalisation for faster and more stable training. YOLO9000 expanded detection capabilities to over 9000 objects.\nYOLOv3 introduced the Darknet-53 backbone with residual connections for better feature extraction, feature pyramid networks and loss function combining logistic regression for class prediction with standard bounding box losses. YOLOv4 focused on various training tricks and data augmentation to boost performance without increasing inference time. YOLOv5 shifted to the more flexible PyTorch framework [96] and introduced varying model sizes (small, medium, large and extra-large) to cater to different speed and accuracy trade-offs. Architectures beyond YOLOv6 focused on efficiency improvements, refined network design, better training strategies, improved speed and enhanced smaller object detection [97].\nSeveral models have been developed to assess waste based on progressive YOLO architectures, with most of the earlier research being based on MSW datasets. YOLO-Trash (YOLOv3) achieved real-time processing of about 20 frames per second (FPS) to perform garbage detection and recognition [98]. Yolov5 demonstrated an accuracy of 84.298% in detecting plastic bottles in rivers and 88.7% for underwater litter detection in a marine environment [99].\nA modified YOLOv5 has a higher mAP (0.9480) compared to YOLOv7 (0.9265) on brick, wood, stone and plastic dataset [83].\nDemetriou et al. assessed 18 models, both single-stage (SSD, YOLO) and two-stage (Faster- RCNN) detector architectures coupled with various backbones feature extractors (ResNet, MobileNetV2, EfficientDet) on 6600 C&DW samples belonging to brick, concrete and tile under working conditions with normal and heavily stacked adhered samples. YOLOv7 attained the best accuracy (mAP50:95 ~ 70%) at the highest inference speed of less than 30ms. Faster R-CNN models were found to remain the most robust, exhibiting the least mAP fluctuations over the testing datasets considered [78].\nYOLOv8, YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 are the current SOTA (state of the art) models, with the main differences being accuracy, speed and scalability [100, 101]. YOLOv8 and its variant models were examined in 10 C&DW categories (bricks, concrete, tiles, wood, pipes, plastics). The largest models (YOLOV8x, YOLOV8-x-seg) achieved the highest accuracy but at the cost of slower inference speeds (mAP50:95-0.936 for boxes, 0.863 for masks) [76].

C&DW can vary in appearance, size, shape and context. The presence of occlusions, clutter, or incomplete waste objects (See Figures 1 and 3 for examples) can make it difficult for DL models to detect and classify waste materials accurately. In addition, determining the composition of mixed materials using RGB cameras can be difficult for several reasons besides the lack of labelled training data. Mixed composition materials can have intricate and non-linear relationships between their components, making it challenging to represent their features accurately [108].\nDue to the above, collecting and accessing a comprehensive dataset that adequately captures the wild nature of C&DW is the first challenging step.

It is often used when real-world data is challenging to obtain, expensive, or private and sensitive. It can also be used to augment existing datasets or to create simulations for testing and training purposes. Privacy is less of a consideration for C&DW datasets than in other fields, such as medicine; however, these may be commercially sensitive. Waste that is deformed and exhibits poor generalizability using models trained on images of non-deformed waste can be modelled with this approach [117", "119": "."}]}

The division of the images into patches by ViT results in a fragmented perception, thereby hindering the visual understanding capabilities of VLMs. In this paper, we propose an innovative enhancement to address this limitation by introducing a Scene Graph Expression (SGE) module in VLMs. This module extracts and structurally expresses the complex semantic information within images, thereby improving the foundational perception and understanding abilities of VLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating our SGE module significantly enhances the VLM's performance in vision-language tasks, indicating its effectiveness in preserving intricate semantic details and facilitating better visual understanding.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large vision-language models (VLMs) integrate data from visual and language modalities, enabling comprehensive multimodal understanding [1]-[3]. With images and query text as input, VLMs can answer queries by incorporating the visual information. However, most VLMs utilize the Vision Transformer (ViT) [4] as their visual backbone, which results in perceiving images as fragmented patches, as shown in Fig. 1(a) with LLaVA as the VLM baseline [5]. This fragmented approach fails to preserve the intrinsic semantic information in images, thus limiting the VLMs' visual comprehension capabilities [5]. To address this limitation, we propose using scene graphs, which express the objects in a scene and the relationships between them to retain and structurally express the complex semantic information in images, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this way, the visual perception and understanding capabilities of VLMs are enhanced with the proposed Scene Graph Expression (SGE) module.\nImproving the perceptual capabilities of VLMs has been the focus of several research efforts. For instance, Lyrics [6] introduces a visual refiner to incorporate semantic-aware visual objects. IVE [7] integrates multitask encoders and visual tools into existing models. Several studies have also explored the use of scene graphs in VLMs [1], [8]. However, training directly on scene graph data or fine-tuning on scene graph text has not yielded optimal results [1], [8].\nTo achieve the structured expression of visual semantic information without directly training on scene graph data, we designed the Scene Graph Expression module. Specifically, we use pretrained visual models to extract entities from images, preserving semantic information at the entity level rather than the patch level. Next, we construct a scene graph using these entities and perform message passing between the nodes in the scene graph. Building on LLaVA [5], we construct LLaVA-SceneGraph (LLaVA-SG), a model that incorporate SGE module to enhance the foundational perception and understanding capabilities of VLMs. To enhance visual understanding, we train LLaVA-SG to classify visual relationships between the extracted entities, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting that might occur with direct training on scene graph data. Our contributions are threefold:\n\u2022 We design a Scene Graph Expression (SGE) module to extract and structurally express the intrinsic semantic information in images.\n\u2022 We incorporate SGE into VLM, resulting in the LLaVA-SG model to enhance the foundational visual perception and understanding capabilities.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive evaluations of the trained LLaVA-SG model on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that the integration of SGE significantly improves visual perception and understanding capabilities of VLM."}, {"title": "II.

An overview of our approach is shown in Fig. 2(b).", "subsections": [{"title": "A. Semantic Information Expression", "content": "1) Visual Entity Extraction: To achieve the structured expression of semantic information in a scene, we first extract the entities within the scene. Specifically, in the Visual Perception Module in Fig. 2(b), we first perform image tagging on the input to identify the categories of the entities it contains. Taking the input image in Fig. 2(b) as an example, the image tagging process will output tags such as \"man\", \"racket\", \"tennis ball\", and \"sports field\". The object detection module then detects the bounding boxes of these entities based on the tagging results. The bounding boxes are rectangular boxes that represents the position and size of each entity. Next, we conduct semantic segmentation within the bounding boxes to obtain the pixels comprising each entity, achieving pixel-level semantic understanding with the help of segmentation masks. We denote the segmentation masks as $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times h_m\\times W_m}$, where $N$ is the number of segmented entities. $h_m$ and $W_m$ denote the height and width of masks.\nTo express the semantic information in images, we design the Scene Graph Expression module, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). The segmentation masks M serve as the input of the SGE module representing entities in the input image.\n2) Scene Graph Expression: We introduce the Scene Graph Expression (SGE) module to structurally preserve and express the semantic information in a scene at the entity level. A scene graph is a graphical representation that captures and expresses the entities and their relationships in a scene. Scene graphs aid in visual comprehension of images and videos, and facilitate scene understanding [19]. Entities in a scene are represented as entities in a scene graph. Additionally, we introduce the prompt feature to activate key nodes in the scene graph. Next, we detail the steps involved in the SGE module.\nTo construct the scene graph for the input image, we first extract the visual features of the entities within the image to represent the nodes. Specifically, we use $F_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e\\times h_vXW_v}$ to denote the visual features of the input image obtained from the pretrained vision encoder, where $d_e$ is the dimension of $F_v$. $h_v$ and $w_v$ denote the shape of the feature map. Following [20], we extract the features of points in the masks M from $F_v$ using bilinear interpolation. Then, for each mask in M, we average the features of the points it contains to obtain the feature representation of the mask. The features of masks are collectively denoted as $F_e \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d_e}$, representing the visual features of the corresponding entities. Second, we construct the scene graph G with these N entities as nodes of the graph and $F_e$ as the node features. Edges among the nodes depict their relationships. We perform message passing among the N nodes to implicitly encode the relationship information between nodes. Third, to make the scene graph expression adaptive, we utilize the prompt feature to activate the key nodes within G. We use $F_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_t\\times d_t}$ to denote the prompt feature where $N_t$ is the number of prompt tokens, and $d_t$ is the dimension of the prompt feature. Specifically, we adopt the attention mechanism to inject the prompt feature $F_t$ into G, highlighting the nodes in G that are relevant to the prompt feature. The updated scene graph is denoted as G', which is the output of the SGE module, representing the structured semantic information contained in the input image."}, {"title": "B. Scene Graph Expression in VLM", "content": "To address the degradation of complex semantic information in VLMs caused by the processing of images as set of patches, we introduce the SGE module into the VLM, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Using LLaVA [18] as the base framework, the image is input into the pretrained vision encoder, and the obtained visual features are used as the input of SGE module, that is, $F_v$. Utilizing the pretrained visual perception module, we obtain the semantic segmentation masks of the input image. The input text is tokenized, and the embeddings are used as the prompt feature for SGE module, denoted as $F_t$. Together, $F_v$, M, and $F_t$ serve as inputs to the SGE module, constructing the scene graph G' activated by the prompt feature. Similar to the projection layer W after the pretrained vision encoder, we apply a trainable projection layer $W_g$ to convert the nodes in G' into language embedding tokens. With the same dimensionality, the converted scene graph tokens are then fed into the Large Language Model, along with the visual tokens and the text tokens. We add two special tokens to the LLM, namely <sg> and <text>, which are inserted before and after the scene graph tokens, respectively. Consequently, the sequence of these tokens is fed into the LLM to generate language response tokens as follows:\n$H_a = LLM([W_v \\cdot F_v, <sg>, W_g \\cdot G', <text>, F_t])$, (1)\nwhere $H_a$ denotes the output of the LLM, serving as the response to the input image and text."}, {"title": "C. Training", "content": "Following LLaVA [5], we train our LLaVA-SG on the prediction tokens of the LLM using an auto-regressive training objective. Building on LLaVA's original two-stage training, we insert an additional training stage specifically for our SGE module. The training of LLaVA-SG thus includes the following three stages:\nVisual Feature Alignment. We initialize the image encoder and the LLM of LLaVA-SG with pretrained weights and keep them frozen. We do not use the SGE module at this stage. Only the visual projection layer $W_v$ is trainable. The dataset of 558K LAION-CCSBU image-text pairs [5], [21] is adopted for training in this stage.\nSGE training. In the second stage, we focus training the SGE module and the corresponding projection layer $W_g$. The visual encoder, visual projection layer, and LLM are all frozen during this stage. Considering that a scene graph contains both entities and the relationships between them, we endow the SGE module with the ability to preserve and express visual semantic information from both perspectives. For entity recognition, we use the pretrained visual perception module. For expressing the relationships between entities, we train the SGE module and the projection layer $W_g$ on visual relationship understanding datasets. Specifically, the visual relationship understanding datasets we use are derived from two sources. First, existing fine-grained visual understanding datasets, such as Visual Genome [22] and Open Image V6 [23], are reformatted into the visual question-answering format. However, the relationships in these datasets are limited and not open-vocabulary. Therefore, we also construct an open-vocabulary visual relationship understanding dataset based on the large-scale visual grounding dataset GRIT [24], utilizing GPT-4v to produce the data.\nFine-tuning. In the third stage, only the visual encoder remains frozen, while all other parameters are trained in LLaVA-SG. We use the 665K image-text instruction dataset from LLaVA-1.5 [18], which contains diverse instructions for fine-tuning in this stage."}]}, {"title": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "A. Experimental Setup\nIn LLaVA-SG, we adopt CLIP ViT-L/14@336p [4], [25] as the vision encoder and Vicuna [26] as the LLM.

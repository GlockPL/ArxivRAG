{"title": "Investigating and Extending Homans' Social Exchange Theory with Large Language Model based Agents", "authors": ["Lei Wang", "Zheqing Zhang", "Xu Chen"], "abstract": "Homans' Social Exchange Theory (SET) is widely recognized as a basic framework for understanding the formation and emergence of human civilizations and social structures. In social science, this theory is typically studied based on simple simulation experiments or real-world human studies, both of which either lack realism or are too expensive to control. In artificial intelligence, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in simulating human behaviors. Inspired by these insights, we adopt an interdisciplinary research perspective and propose using LLM-based agents to study Homans' SET. Specifically, we construct a virtual society composed of three LLM agents and have them engage in a social exchange game to observe their behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we found that Homans' SET is well validated in our agent society, demonstrating the consistency between the agent and human behaviors. Building on this foundation, we intentionally alter the settings of the agent society to extend the traditional Homans' SET, making it more comprehensive and detailed. To the best of our knowledge, this paper marks the first step in studying Homans' SET with LLM-based agents. More importantly, it introduces a novel and feasible research paradigm that bridges the fields of social science and computer science through LLM-based agents.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Exchange behavior has been a fundamental characteristic of human society since ancient times, as people fulfill each other's needs through both material and non-material exchanges. Social Exchange Theory (SET) (Homans, 1958), proposed by George Homans, stands as one of the most fundamental frameworks in social science for understanding human interaction patterns. By conceptualizing social behaviors as exchange processes where individuals seek to maximize their benefits, Homans' SET provides profound insights into the mechanisms underlying human social interactions. Its influence extends far beyond sociology, shaping our understanding of human behavior across multiple disciplines including psychology, organizational behavior, and economics."}, {"title": "2 Preliminary", "content": "To enhance the clarity of our paper, this section provides a brief introduction to Homans' SET. In general, Homans' SET conceptualizes human social behaviors as exchange processes where individuals assess rewards and costs in social interactions. More specifically, there are six core propositions:\nProp 1 (Success Proposition) This proposition suggests that a rewarded action is more likely to be repeated in the following behaviors.\nProp 2 (Stimulus Proposition) This proposition suggests that similar stimuli to those associated with past rewards trigger similar actions.\nProp 3 (Value Proposition) This proposition suggests that more valuable outcomes increase the likelihood of a human action.\nProp 4 (Deprivation-Satiation Proposition) This proposition suggests that the value of a reward diminishes with frequent recent receipt.\nProp 5 (Aggression-Approval Proposition)This proposition suggests that unexpected punishment leads to anger behavior, while unexpected rewards or avoided punishment elicit approval.\nProp 6 (Rationality Proposition) This proposition suggests that people choose actions with the highest expected value based on past experience and perceived probability of success."}, {"title": "3 The Constructed Agent Society", "content": "Since Homans' SET building on social exchange emphasizes complex interpersonal dynamics and intrinsic psychological processes, traditional agent frameworks designed for general purposes may not effectively capture these nuanced behaviors. As a result, we build a tailored agent framework for social exchange, which highlights the following four components:\n\u2022 Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI). To accurately simulate human analytical capabilities, we adopt the BDI framework to model agents' decision-making processes, where Belief represents the agent's understanding of its own resources, Desire defines the agent's target objectives, and Intention outlines the action plans the agent intends to pursue.\n\u2022 Affinity. In real-world social exchange behaviors, psychological factors can significantly influence human decisions. To model this phenomenon, we maintain an emotional score for each agent toward others based on their interaction history. These scores evolve dynamically: they increase when exchanges are reciprocal and beneficial, and decrease when agents experience unfair exchanges or breaches of commitment.\n\u2022 Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI). In practice, people may exchange resources with others based on both rational and experiential thinking styles. To flexibly balance these styles, we introduce the REI framework, where each agent is assigned two scores ranging from 1 to 5: a rational score that quantifies analytical capacity and an experiential score that measures reliance on intuition and past experiences.\n\u2022 Social Value Orientation (SVO). Value orientations fundamentally shape behavioral patterns in social exchanges. To model such factors, we draw on established research and classify agents into two categories: Proself agents who optimize for individual utility maximization, and Prosocial agents who pursue reciprocal benefits in interactions."}, {"title": "3.2 Multi-Agent Society", "content": "Building upon the above agent framework, we implement a multi-agent society to validate and extend Homans' SET. This virtual society involves M agents, who can exchange N distinct types of resources. Each agent starts with an equal allocation of initial resources and receives S units of their specialized resource at the beginning of each round. To promote social exchange behavior, we design a value system where resource combinations generate higher value. The goal of the agents is to maximize their total resource value.\nThe agent society is executed in a round-by-round manner, and in each round, there are two sequential phases: (1) In the negotiation phase, agents engage in up to three rounds of discussions (2) In the exchange phase, agents independently decide how to allocate their resources."}, {"title": "4 Validation of Homans' SET", "content": "In this section, we evaluate whether the six propositions of Homans' SET, which have been widely validated in real-human societies, also hold in our agent society. In our experiments, the number of resources and agents are both set as 3, that is, M = N = 3. The value coefficients r1, r2 and r3 are set as 1, 4 and 9, respectively. Initially, each agent has 5 units of each resource type. At the beginning of each round, agents receive 15 units (S = 15) of their specialized resource.\nWhile the following observations are drawn from comprehensive experimental data, we illustrate the key patterns through a representative case study for better interpretation. In general, there are three distinct phases. In the initial exploration phase, the agents exhibited cautious behavior due to the lack of interaction history, engaging in small-scale exchanges to probe counterparts' reliability and preferences. In the thriving cooperation phase, agents developed sophisticated exchange strategies based on learned preferences and trust levels. In the strategic endgame phase, the agents demonstrated sophisticated strategic adaptation.\nWith the above intuitive understandings of our agent society, we now systematically validate the Homans' SET propositions as follows:"}, {"title": "Validation on the Success and Value Propositions", "content": "The evidence for these propositions is shown in the evolution of exchange value across different phases. Initially, agents demonstrate cautious behavior with small exchange values. The substantial increase during the thriving phase validate the Success Proposition by showing how positive experiences lead to more effective exchanges. The endgame phase maintains a high median value, validating the Value Proposition based on the fact that trustworthy agents sustain high-value exchanges."}, {"title": "Validation on the Deprivation-Satiation Proposition", "content": "demonstrates a clear inverse relationship between resource abundance and proposal acceptance rates, validating the Deprivation-Satiation Proposition. We measure resource abundance as the ratio of a resource's quantity to the average quantity of all resources an agent possesses in each round, categorizing these ratios into quartiles from Scarce to Abundant. The results show acceptance rates of 70% under resource scarcity, steadily declining to 23% as resources become abundant."}, {"title": "Validation on the Aggression-Approval Proposition", "content": "The agents' responses to trust violations strongly support the Aggression-Approval Proposition. The data reveals a graduated response pattern: minor violations trigger a 33.3% reduction in future exchanges, moderate breaches lead to a 65.1% decrease, while severe violations result in an almost complete cessation of trading relationships. This proportional punishment mechanism demonstrates how agents develop sophisticated trust management strategies."}, {"title": "Validation on the Rationality and Stimulus Propositions", "content": "In general, the agents make decisions by optimizing their values based on accumulated experience and current circumstances, which is consistent with the Rationality Proposition. For example, in the transition between exchange phases, agents adjust their strategies based on established trust levels and resource requirements. In addition, the Stimulus Proposition can be validated through the consistent response patterns observed across similar exchange scenarios, especially during the thriving phase where agents develop stable exchange behaviors under familiar circumstances.\nThe above experiments collectively demonstrate that all six propositions of Homans' SET can be effectively validated in our agent society, providing a promising foundation for investigating previously unexplored aspects of social exchange theory in human society through LLM-based agents."}, {"title": "5 Extensions of Homans' SET", "content": "A significant advantage of our agent society lies in its flexibility in adjusting agent settings, enabling us to explore Homans' SET under various conditions, which would be prohibitively expensive or even infeasible using traditional real human-based methods. Leveraging this advantage, we extend traditional Homans' SET by conducting a systematic investigation into how cognitive styles and social value orientations influence exchange behaviors, while also examining the resilience of the social system."}, {"title": "5.1 Cognitive Style", "content": "In this section, we explore how different cognitive styles influence social exchange behaviors. To answer this question, we first set the agents to operate in either a completely rational or a completely experiential manner and then systematically compare their behaviors. The results reveal distinct behavioral patterns: rational agents exhibit greater fluctuations in both exchange values and affinity scores, whereas experiential agents demonstrate more stability in these metrics over time.\nFrom a broader perspective, this experiment suggests that if a human relies solely on experience to make decisions, their gains will remain stable but are unlikely to reach very high levels. However, if a human is entirely rational, while they may occasionally achieve very high benefits, they also face the risk of significant losses.\nBased on above experimental evidence and analyses, we derive the following corollary further extending Homans' SET:\nCorollary 1 (The Stability Corollary) In the real world, rational individuals are more likely to achieve higher benefits, but they also face the risk of greater losses. In contrast, individuals with an experiential thinking style tend to achieve more stable but moderate benefits over time."}, {"title": "5.2 Social Value Orientations", "content": "In this section, we are curious about the influence of social value orientations on human exchange behaviors. Specifically, we conduct experiments by setting the agents to be Proself and Prosocial, respectively, and then collect their behaviors for analysis. reveals behavioral differences between the two orientations. While Proself agents show wider outcome variability and occasionally achieve higher individual values, their exchange patterns result in lower average outcomes. Prosocial agents achieve higher mean values with more consistent distributions, suggesting that maintaining stable exchange relationships benefits long-term value accumulation.\nThese observations lead us to propose the second corollary of Homans' SET:\nCorollary 2 (The Reciprocity Corollary) Exchange behaviors guided by mutual benefit principles lead to more stable and efficient resource distribution in social exchange systems."}, {"title": "5.3 Social System Resilience", "content": "Building upon the case study shown in Figure 3, we extended our simulation for an additional ten rounds to examine system behavior after significant trust violations. The data reveals that while agents initially reduce their exchange activity following trust breaches, they gradually resume exchanges through adaptive strategies. The patterns show that while Agent C maintains relatively stable exchange value, Agent A and Agent B exhibit more volatile behaviors. The persistent exchange patterns between rounds 10-20 suggest an inherent system stability driven by fundamental exchange need of each agent.\nBased on these observations, we have the third corollary of Homans' SET:\nCorollary 3 (The Resilience Corollary) An established social exchange system tends toward stability through member adaptation, driven by their interdependent resource needs."}, {"title": "5.4 Real-World Experiments on Evaluating the Corollaries of Homans' SET", "content": "In this section, we aim to empirically evaluate the corollaries proposed above with real human experiments. Since it is quite difficult to control real human cognitive styles and social value orientations, we focus on the resilience corollary.\nIn specific, we recruited three human participants, and let each of them interact with two LLM-based agents in the constructed agent society. These agents are programmed to violate trust at round 10 by withholding all previously promised resources. the observed exchange patterns in both human and agent trials demonstrate remarkable similarities. These consistent patterns validate our resilience corollary while demonstrating that our agent framework effectively captures how people adapt to trust violations in social exchanges."}, {"title": "6 Related Work", "content": "Social Exchange Theory is a foundational framework in sociology and social psychology that views social interactions as transactions of value. In organizational and workplace behavior, it is considered a \u201cgold standard\" for explaining dynamics like employee-employer relationships, leadership trust, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Beyond organizations, SET has been used in social psychology to examine friendships, family relations, and even romantic partnerships as exchanges of emotional support, information, and other resources.\nRecent refinements to SET have deepened its explanatory power. However, their model, which reduced agent behavior to simple exchanges of money and recognition, overlooked emotional subjectivity. To address this limitation, our approach employs LLM-driven agents to simulate more complex human interactions, offering a more accurate implementation of SET.\""}, {"title": "6.2 LLM-driven Agent-based Modeling", "content": "The rise of LLMs has significantly advanced agent-based modeling by enabling agents with human-like behavior and decision-making capabilities.

Through our structured experimental framework, we validated Homans' SET propositions and proposed new corollaries that extend our understanding of social exchange dynamics in multi-agent systems. While our controlled environment and simplified resource exchange scenario may not fully capture the complexity of real-world social interactions, the consistent behavioral patterns observed across different agent profiles suggest promising directions for future research."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "There are several limitations of this paper. First, our experimental environment is relatively simplified, with structured negotiation protocols and basic resource types that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world social exchanges. Second, due to LLM API cost constraints, we were limited in the number of experimental trials and rounds, which may affect the generalizability of our findings. Third, while agents provide rationales for their decisions, our analysis of their internal thought processes and detailed exchange behaviors could be more comprehensive. Finally, we did not consider the potential impact of cultural factors on exchange dynamics. Future research could address these limitations by designing more complex exchange scenarios, conducting larger-scale experiments, performing deeper analysis of agent decision processes, and examining the role of cultural variations in social exchanges."}, {"title": "A Human Study", "content": "We conducted a multi-agent social exchange experiment with human-AI interaction, where three graduate student participants (acting as Agent C) negotiated with two LLM agents (Agent A and Agent B) over resource allocation.

Introduction", "content": "Public transport systems are integral to urban life and provide essential mobility services to millions of people.\nIn France, nearly 70% of Parisians rely on the metro, buses, or suburban trains for their daily commutes. Statistica\n(2020) underscored the critical role of these systems in facilitating urban connectivity, particularly in densely popu-\nlated regions like \u00cele de France, including Paris and suburban areas. However, these systems are inherently vulnerable\nto disruptive events ranging from technical failures to natural disasters (Zhang et al., 2023). Such vulnerabilities have\nbeen extensively analyzed in recent studies focusing on the resilience and vulnerability of urban rail transit systems\nunder various disruptive scenarios (Huang and Loo, 2023; Xu et al., 2024). The cost of disruptions extends beyond op-\nerational delays, which encompass the economic losses and reputational damage incurred by operators due to service\ninterruptions, the time cost to passengers resulting from delayed journeys, and the potential strain on public authorities\nmanaging the aftermath (De Ona et al., 2016). According to Jenelius and Mattsson (2020), disruptions within the pub-\nlic transport system can occur unexpectedly, potentially triggering cascading effects on both the demand and supply\nsides. For instance, Yap and Cats (2019) observed that the Washington DC metro network experiences an average of\n20 incidents daily, leading to train or line delays of a minimum of two minutes. Similarly, studies have highlighted\nthe resilience challenges in global metro systems during unexpected events, emphasizing the need for comprehensive\ndisruption management frameworks (Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024). Furthermore, it is imperative for public\ntransport providers to not only devise proactive strategies for such disruptions but also respond promptly to these\noccurrences, ensuring the continuity of a resilient service. Resilience refers to the ability of a public transport sys-\ntem to effectively minimize both the scale and duration of disruptions and return to its normal performance (Chopra\net al., 2016). This definition aligns with recent research emphasizing the critical role of resilience in maintaining\nservice continuity and mitigating the impacts of disruptions on urban transport systems (Sajjad et al., 2021). In this\nstudy, we applied our disruption-management model to the rail system, which is a critical component of urban public"}, {"title": "2. Literature review", "content": "In this section, we provide a structured exploration of previous studies on disruption management in public trans-\nportation systems. By organizing the studies into distinct subsections, those that explored conventional and bridging\napproaches to disruption management highlighted the progress of research efforts from foundational approaches to\ninnovative solutions."}, {"title": "2.1. Conventional approach: adjusting rolling stock and timetables", "content": "Research addressing disruptions in public transport systems often concentrates on rail services, with conventional\nstrategies typically involving adjustments to the rolling stock and timetables. For example, Cadarso et al. (2013)\nintroduced a heuristic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimizing train schedules and rolling\nstock in response to urban rail network disruptions, with a focus on passengers' reactions to the disruption. Recovery\nstrategies involve either the cancellation of current train services or the addition of new ones. However, the option of\nrescheduling the timing of existing trains was not considered. Besides, Veelenturf et al. (2017) employed a heuristic\niterative framework that acknowledges passenger demand for the rescheduling of both rolling stock and timetables\ninto disruption management. Their approach modified timetables to incorporate additional stops. However, only train\nstops at stations that they normally would not call can be used in timetable decisions, and passengers need to adapt\ntheir paths to the new schedule. Zhan et al. (2015) proposed a two-stage model for rescheduling train timetables,\naimed at minimizing the total delay caused by a complete railway blockage. This model integrates stop planning as\na key constraint and is structured as a MILP model to prevent the cancellation or rerouting of en-route trains. This\nstudy specifically examined the scheduling challenges posed by a complete blockage of railways for high-speed trains,\nwhich may not encompass partial blockages or other types of rail services. Further research has expanded on these\nmodels, incorporating resilience assessments to address the broader impacts of such disruptions on urban transporta-\ntion systems (Chen et al., 2023). Kroon et al. (2015) tackled the challenge of large-scale disruptions and presented\nan approach to real-time rolling stock rescheduling amidst railway disruptions, offering a simulation model integrated\nwith passenger flow dynamics to optimize the schedules and minimize passenger delays. The authors developed a\ntwo-step simulation methodology, initially simulating passenger traffic dynamics and subsequently integrating the re-\nsults into a rolling-stock rescheduling model. Although this minimizes passenger delays, this study did not analyze the\nrelated operational costs of rescheduling. Additionally, the model demonstrated heightened effectiveness during peak\nhours with a constrained seat capacity; however, its efficacy may diminish during off-peak periods. Zhan et al. (2016)\nconcentrated on the rescheduling of double-track high-speed trains in case of partial blockage, with the duration of the\nblockage being uncertain. They developed a MILP model and employed a rolling-horizon algorithm to address the\nissue. Although this model can yield an optimized timetable, it has computational complexity and slow response, par-\nticularly for extensive railway networks. Ghaemi et al. (2018) extends the rescheduling of mixed integer programming\n(MIP) models from macroscopic to a microscopic level during complete blockages. When applied to real test cases,\nthe model can include timetables and transition plans by employing short-turning, partial cancellation, and reschedul-\ning strategies and considering the impact of disruption duration. Owing to the complexity of the problem, this study\nfocused primarily on addressing a single disruption at a time. Based on their previous work Zhan et al. (2016), Zhan\net al. (2021) integrated a train rescheduling and passenger routing problem while considering seat capacity and train\nrouting at the microscopic level using the alternating direction method of multipliers for decomposition solved with a\ndynamic programming approach, to minimize the cost of each passenger on travel duration. However, disrupted trains\nmust wait until the disruption ends, which leads to long delays for passengers. Shakibayifar et al. (2020) focused on\nminimizing train delays and deviations from the set timetable, assigning weights to these delays based on passenger\ndemand at each station. They utilized the MIP model to represent railway infrastructure, assuming a limited station ca-\npacity. To address this problem, they proposed an exact solution method and two heuristic approaches: right-shift and\ntwo-stage rescheduling. Nevertheless, this solution was effective only for short-duration track blockages, as it could\nnot provide a solution within a reasonable timeframe for longer disruption durations. Hassannayebi et al. (2021) in-\ntroduced a decision support system employing a simulation-optimization framework aimed at reducing the average\nwait duration for passengers by implementing rescheduling strategies such as short-turn and skip-stop methods. Their\napproach was supplemented with a variable neighborhood search algorithm with a non-stationary Poisson arrival rate\nof passengers. However, their solution did not capture the inter-decision dynamics between mobility service operators\nand commuters. However, adjusting rolling-back and timetable strategies is ineffective for promptly addressing the\ndirect impacts of service disruptions, resulting in significant system-wide delays. This is because of the time gap\nbetween decision-making by operators and the execution of recovery actions, as discussed in Kepaptsoglou and Kar-\nlaftis (2009). Additionally, these studies address disruption management only from a passenger-centric perspective.\nTo overcome these challenges, a bridging approach has emerged to mitigate the impacts of unplanned disruptions."}, {"title": "2.2. Bridging strategy: bus, taxi, and multimodal", "content": "This subsection explores the bridging strategy, which restorers connectivity between disrupted segments of trans-\nportation networks, using alternative transport means such as buses, taxis, and multimodal services to maintain service\ncontinuity (Wang et al., 2023). This approach has been increasingly recognized in the literature, with studies highlight-\ning the benefits of multimodal integration and the challenges of implementing such strategies effectively in dense urban\nenvironments (Chen and wan Zhang, 2024). Kepaptsoglou and Karlaftis (2009) advocate for the use of bus bridging\nservice for rail disruption management. Their contributions included a three-tiered modeling framework aimed at\ndefining the bus bridging environment, designing bus routes, and allocating resources. They emphasized passenger\nwelfare by considering demand patterns and resource constraints when designing bus-bridging routes. However, their\napproach did not account for the complexities of long-term or system-wide disruptions. Jin et al. (2016) utilized a col-\numn generation algorithm to generate potential bridging routes to minimize the total increase in travel duration of all\ncommuters in disruption compared to normal situations. They employed an integrated optimization model to perform\nroute selection, frequency determination, and bus allocation. This study applies a demand-responsive approach if the\nbus routes originate from a bus node located at the end of the disrupted segment. Although the column-generation\nalgorithm effectively generates demand-responsive candidate bus routes, its scalability may be limited when applied\nto disruptions that affect extensive network segments. Additionally, the model's focus on optimizing travel time re-\nductions might inadvertently neglect certain bus routes that, although not optimal in terms of travel time, could be\ncritical for servicing remote or less connected areas. This oversight can affect the comprehensive coverage of the\nnetwork, potentially leaving some areas underserved during critical disruption events.\nRather than designing route choice models, Codina et al. (2013) developed a mathematical nonlinear integer pro-\ngramming (NIP) model and a heuristic solution method for planning a bus-bridging system. The model considered\ndeciding bus allocation on each bus bridging route and commuter traveling route under congestion, to minimize travel\nduration. using automatic fare collection data, they assumed the existence of a set of predefined bus bridging routes.\nThis study primarily addressed the micro-level operational aspects of bus bridging systems, including commuter\nqueuing flows at bus stops and the available space for bus queuing. However, their approach focused only on existing\nbridging routes, which did not dynamically adapt to unforeseen disruption events. In contrast to approaches that rely\non static bridging systems, Gu et al. (2018) developed a two-stage NIP model to create a flexible bus bridging plan that\nallows for the dynamic sequencing of stations visited by each bus. This model aimed to balance bus operations with\ncommuter needs and incorporate a rolling-horizon framework to manage dynamic passenger arrivals during rail dis-\nruptions. This approach enables buses to serve varying routes and optimizes both bridging time and passenger delay.\nIn practice, the proposed model may result in queuing buses owing to limited spaces at the affected stations and in-\ncrease the travel duration when numerous bridging buses run on the same link. De-Los-Santos et al. (2012) measured\nrail network robustness from the user's perspective, comparing system behaviors under disruptions with and without\nbus bridging services. This study measured passenger travel duration and flow before and after rail failures to evaluate\nand assess how bus bridging reduces the total travel duration of the network. However, this study does not explore\nbroader aspects of network performance, such as overall operational efficiency or the financial implications of disrup-\ntions. Wang et al. (2014) examined the impact of random commuter demand on bus bridging scenarios, employing\ncompound Poisson processes including balking and reneging, and conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to\nexplore passenger behavior in closed public transport systems under budget constraints. However, their study primar-\nily focused on demand modeling and did not address the bus-bridging network design, which is a central aspect of\nbus-bridging services. Another study conducted under budget constraints by Van der Hurk et al. (2016) developed\na model to optimize shuttle bus lines and frequencies, aiming to minimize commuter inconvenience costs, including\ntransfer- and frequency-dependent wait duration costs. An MIP formulation based on a path-based multicommodity\nflow model was used to determine the optimal set of bridging bus routes and their frequencies. However, this model\nassumes that demand and frequency are not time-dependent. Although this assumption is common in high-frequency\nnetworks with cyclic timetables, it may not be valid for all public transportation networks.\nBesides, Yang et al. (2017) investigated the bus bridging problem for rail transit system congestion, proposing a\ntwo-stage mathematical modeling procedure. They developed a two-objective timetable model and designed a binary\ncoding genetic algorithm to solve the IP model to minimize the passenger wait duration. This study did not incor-\nporate the concept of time intervals to describe the evolution of boarding/alighting passengers from a network-level\nperspective. Zhang and Lo (2018) addressed the determination of substitute bus service initiation time under uncertain\nrailway disruption recovery time, aiming to minimize the combined costs of bus initiation time and commuter delay."}, {"title": "2.3.

The associated cost reflects the fact that\nthe effort and expenses escalate more rapidly as the requested arrival duration shortens, as discussed in Zhang and Lo\n(2020). This cost is calculated using 19.\n\n$CA_{(y^{rs,m,x})} = \\frac{CA^{x,m} \\cdot y_{ij}^{rs,m,x}}{TA_{ij}^{x,m}} \\quad \\forall i\\in I^n, \\forall j\\in J^n, \\forall m \\in M, \\forall x \\in X^m$"}, {"title": "4."}]}

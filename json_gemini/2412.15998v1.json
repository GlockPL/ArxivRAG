{"title": "CNN-LSTM Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Remaining Useful Life Estimation", "authors": ["Muthukumar G.", "Jyosna Philip"], "abstract": "Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a component or a system is defined as the length from the current time to the end of the useful life. Accurate RUL estimation plays a crucial role in Predictive Maintenance applications. Data driven approaches for RUL estimation use sensor data and operational data to estimate RUL. Traditional regression methods, both linear and non-linear, have struggled to achieve high accuracy in this domain. Although Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has been applied to predict RUL, it cannot learn salient features automatically, because of its network structure. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown improved accuracy, they often overlook the sequential nature of the data, relying instead on features derived from sliding windows. Since RUL prediction inherently involves multivariate time series analysis, robust sequence learning is essential. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for RUL estimation. Although CNN-based LSTM models have been applied to sequence prediction tasks in financial forecasting, this is the first attempt to adopt this approach for RUL estimation in prognostics. In this approach, CNN is first employed to efficiently extract features from the data, followed by LSTM, which uses these extracted features to predict RUL. This method effectively leverages sensor sequence information, uncovering hidden patterns within the data, even under multiple operating conditions and fault scenarios. For comparative purpose, we also evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms including Gradient Boosting, MLP, CNN, LSTM and Random Forest on the NASA CMAPSS dataset, which includes sensor data linked to the RUL of various jet engines. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves the highest accuracy, offering a superior R\u00b2 score compared to the other methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

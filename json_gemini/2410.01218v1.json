Herrmann"], "abstract": "As a society, we are faced with important challenges to combat climate change. Geological Carbon\nStorage (GCS), during which gigatonnes of super-critical CO2 are stored underground, is arguably the\nonly scalable net-negative CO2-emission technology that is available. While promising, subsurface\ncomplexities and heterogeneity of reservoir properties demand a systematic approach to quantify\nuncertainty when optimizing production and mitigating storage risks, which include assurances of\nContainment and Conformance of injected supercritical CO2. As a first step towards the design and\nimplementation of a Digital Twin for monitoring and control of underground storage operations,\na machine-learning-based data-assimilation framework is introduced and validated on carefully\ndesigned realistic numerical simulations. Because our implementation is based on Bayesian inference,\nbut does not yet support control and decision-making, we coin our approach an uncertainty-aware\nDigital Shadow. To characterize the posterior distribution for the state of CO2 plumes (its CO2\nconcentration and pressure), conditioned on multi-modal time-lapse data, the envisioned Shadow\ncombines techniques from Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) and Ensemble Bayesian Filtering to\nestablish probabilistic baselines and assimilate multi-modal data for GCS problems that are challenged\nby large degrees of freedom, nonlinear multiphysics, non-Gaussianity, and computationally expensive\nto evaluate fluid-flow and seismic simulations. To enable SBI for dynamic systems, a recursive\nscheme is proposed where the Digital Shadow's neural networks are trained on simulated ensembles\nfor their state and observed data (well and/or seismic). Once training is completed, the system's state\nis inferred when time-lapse field data becomes available. Contrary to ensemble Kalman filtering,\ncorrections to the predicted simulated states are not based on linear updates, but instead follow during\nthe Analysis step of Bayesian filtering from a prior-to-posterior mapping through the latent space of\na nonlinear transform. Starting from a probabilistic model for the permeability field, derived from\na baseline surface-seismic survey, the proposed Digital Shadow is validated on unseen simulated\nground-truth time-lapse data. In this computational study, we observe that a lack of knowledge on the\npermeability field can be factored into the Digital Shadow's uncertainty quantification. Our results\nalso indicate that the highest reconstruction quality is achieved when the state of the CO2 plume is\nconditioned on both time-lapse seismic data and wellbore measurements. Despite the incomplete\nknowledge of the permeability field, the proposed Digital Shadow was able to accurately track the\nunseen physical state of the subsurface throughout the duration of a realistic CO2 injection project.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first proof-of-concept of an uncertainty-aware,\nin-principle scalable, Digital Shadow that captures the uncertainty arising from unknown reservoir\nproperties and noisy observations. This framework provides a foundation for the development of\na Digital Twin aimed at mitigating risks and optimizing the management of underground storage\nprojects.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 The need for Geological Carbon Storage", "content": "Geological carbon storage (GCS) constitutes capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial processes\nfollowed by storage in deep geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, or\ncoal seams (Page et al. 2020). Because of its ability to scale (Ringrose 2020, 2023), this net-negative CO2-emission\ntechnology is widely considered as one of the most promising technologies to help mitigate the effects of anthropogenic\nCO2 greenhouse gas emissions, which are major contributors to global warming (Bui et al. 2018; IPCC special report\n2005). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, Panel on Climate Change) (2018)), it\nis imperative to contain atmospheric warming to < 2\u00b0C by the year 2100 to avoid serious consequences of global\nwarming. To achieve this goal, scalable net-negative emission technologies that can remove tens of gigatonnes of CO2\nper year (IPCC special report 2018) are needed in addition to reducing emissions. These needs call for a transition\ntowards increased use of renewable energy in combination with the global deployment of GCS technology to store\nsignificant amounts of supercritical CO2 into geological formations to mitigate the effects of climate change (Metz et\nal. 2005; Orr Jr 2009). When supercritical CO2-captured at anthropogenic sources (fossil-fuel power plants, steel,\ncement, and chemical industries), is stored securely and permanently in underground geological storage reservoirs, it\ncan be scaled to mitigate upto 20% of the total CO2 emission problem (Ketzer, Iglesias, and Einloft 2012). This work is\na first step towards an uncertainty-aware Digital Twin aimed at optimizing underground operations while mitigating\nrisks."}, {"title": "1.2 The challenge of monitoring subsurfcae CO2 injection projects", "content": "Our main technical objective is directed towards monitoring CO2-storage projects, so that assurances can be made\nwhether storage proceeds as expected and whether CO2 plumes remain within the storage complex. These assurances\nare referred to as Conformance and Containment by the regulators and operators of GCS (Ringrose 2020, 2023). Even\nthough the proposed methodology could be applied to other settings, our focus is on CO2 storage in offshore saline\naquifers in a marine setup as illustrated in figure 1. Compared to storage projects on land, this choice for marine\nsettings circumvents potential complications and risks associated with future liability and geomechanically-induced\npressure changes that may trigger earthquakes (Zoback and Gorelick 2012; He et al. 2011; Raza et al. 2016). While this\napproach simplifies the complexity of underground CO2 storage projects to some degree, simulations for the state of\nCO2 plumes are on balance more challenging than conventional reservoir simulations because the fluid-flow properties\nare less well-known. Besides, the process of displacing brine with supercritical CO2 is intricate, taxing multi-phase flow\nsimulators (Ringrose 2020, 2023). To illustrate the possible impact of lack of knowledge on the reservoir properties (the\npermeability), figure 1 also includes a juxtaposition between multi-phase flow simulations for two different realizations\nof permeability fields drawn from a stochastic baseline established from active-source surface seismic data (Yin, Orozco,\net al. 2024). While both realizations for the permeability are consistent with this baseline, they yield vastly different\noutcomes where in one case the CO2 plume remains well within (figure 1 bottom-left) the storage complex (denoted by\nthe white dashed line in figure 1) whereas the other simulation obviously breaches Containment (figure 1 bottom-right),\ndue to the presence of an \u201cunknown\u201d high-permeability streak.

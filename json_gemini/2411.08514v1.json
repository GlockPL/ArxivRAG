These mental representations are dynamic in nature and develop over time, thereby enabling explainers to react to explainees' needs by adapting and customizing the explanation. XAI should be able to react to explainees' needs in a similar manner. Therefore, a component that incorporates aspects of explainers' mental representations of explainees is required. In this study, we took first steps by investigating explainers' mental representations in everyday explanations of technological artifacts. According to the dual nature theory, technological artifacts require explanations with two distinct perspectives, namely observable and measurable features addressing \"Architecture\" or interpretable aspects addressing \"Relevance\". We conducted extended semi structured pre-, post- and video recall-interviews with explainers (N=9) in the context of an explanation. The transcribed interviews were analyzed utilizing qualitative content analysis. The explainers' answers regarding the explainees' knowledge and interests with regard to the technological artifact emphasized the vagueness of early assumptions of explainers toward strong beliefs in the course of explanations. The assumed knowledge of explainees in the beginning is centered around Architecture and develops toward knowledge with regard to both Architecture and Relevance. In contrast, explainers assumed higher interests in Relevance in the beginning to interests regarding both Architecture and Relevance in the further course of explanations. Further, explainers often finished the explanation despite their perception that explainees still had gaps in knowledge.

As research in this regard is still at an early stage [23], stepping up efforts to accelerate development of mechanisms that perceive and react to human needs for person-specific and adaptive ex- plainable systems is a necessity.\nThus far, numerous studies have not considered if given explanations meet the needs and expectations of end users [21,33]. It can be concluded that XAI would benefit from increased consideration of human end users, thereby implying that XAI should recognize these individuals with their specific needs in specific con- texts [21,33,34,38,41]. These individuals require different explanations [38], and XAI should be able to understand why the individual requires a specific expla- nation [11]. Enabling XAI to adapt to specific needs and requests will enable customized explanations [23] that are of greater benefit for the end user. Imag- ine, for example, a medical setting in which the end user could be a practicing physician, a medical student, or even a patient. Every end user will utilize the XAI system in a slightly different manner and for different reasons, thereby al- tering the foci and context in which the XAI system is used.\nAccording to Ribera and Lapedriza [38], user-centered XAI should aim to an- swer the following questions: Why does something need to be explained? What needs to be explained? How does it need to be explained? And who does it need to be explained to? Imagine someone requires an explanation on how to use an app vs. on how to alter the algorithms of an app. For this, XAI should have a component that contains information regarding human end users as well as their developing knowledge and interests.\nTo be able to develop such a component, it has to be understood how mental rep- resentations of humans evolve and which information they contain. Therefore, in this empirical study, we investigated everyday explanations among human interlocutors to understand the role of mental representations the explaining person has of the other interlocutor. It is of special interest to investigate what the explainer learns about the developing knowledge and interests of the other interlocutor. The study aims at identifying aspects within the mental represen- tations that are helpful to develop advanced XAI with the ability to react to the needs of users. This paper also includes practical implications for structuring synthetic explanations.\nIn the following account, we first provide a theoretical basis, where we take a closer look at explanations and the characteristics of objects of explanations. Thereafter, we delve into mental representations of knowledge and interests be- fore we segue to the research questions."}, {"title": "Explanations.", "content": "Explanations are an integral part of our daily lives and shape our understanding of the environment we live in [24,27].

The main characteristics of technological artifacts is that they are made by humans to fulfill certain purposes [26,50]. According to the philosophy of technology, a prominent feature of technological artifacts is their dual na- ture-comprising an Architecture and a Relevance side [26,44,49]. Architecture incorporates observable features that span from mechanisms to structure, which can be interpreted as an objective perspective on technological artifacts. In con- trast, Relevance refers to goals, purposes, and intentions, thereby resembling a subjective perspective.\nWhen explaining technological artifacts, both sides of the duality can be ad- dressed [26,50] and obviously both sides can be demanded by users of XA\u0399. For example, users could ask for more information regarding physical properties, such as the code and underlying algorithms (Architecture) or about the functions and purpose of the system (Relevance). Therefore, the perspective of the dual nature theory might be suitable to analyze the knowledge and interests of EEs. Empha- sizing one of the two dual sides during an explanation is not something that is"}, {"title": "The Partner Model.", "content": "Important aspects of evolving mental representations of interlocutors over the course of explanations fall within the scope of this paper. When communicating in the context of everyday explanations, interlocu- tors usually do not do this in isolation but in reference to a partner; hence, they behave in a partner-oriented manner [3] and take each other into account [2]. Being aware of the interlocutor is crucial to a suitable and satisfying explana- tion [7]. The aforementioned awareness can be specified in terms of perceiving the interlocutors' emotions and motivation as well as their prior and developing knowledge, interests, and ability to understand [3,10]. The mental representation of these facets can be subsumed under the term \u201cpartner model\u201d [10], which is necessary for EXs to be able to react to EEs' knowledge and interests [2]. In other words, the explainer needs to know what the interlocutor already knows and wants to know [3]. This is particularly important in terms to emphasize, as EXs can be biased toward their own knowledge and may not consider the"}, {"title": "The Technical Model within the Partner Model.", "content": "The EXs' partner models include information regarding the knowledge [1,9] EEs have. As we are investigat- ing everyday explanations of technological artifacts, EEs' knowledge regarding technological artifacts is called a technical model. Therefore, we also speak of the technical model within the partner model. The technical model is represented mentally and is structured by the duality of technical artifacts. The technical model is required to be able to understand, to reason about, and foretell the states of technological artifacts [18]. Within the technical model, different types of knowledge can be identified-for example, declarative knowledge [32], such as names and characteristics of elements, and procedural knowledge regarding the operation and manipulation of systems [53]. Developing technical models are related to technical models of comparable systems [40]. Because people have varying abilities and different interpretations of the purpose of technological ar- tifacts, technical models are distinct and differ between individuals [22,19]. In ex- planations, technical models develop over time. This process has been described as a multistage one [16]. The initial stage is characterized by the identification of the elements a situation or system can possess, whereas the second stage is characterized by the identification of interrelatedness between the various ele- ments and the ways in which interaction can occur [32].\nWhen a technical model cannot be effectively utilized in specific contexts, techni- cal models are updated by either adding novel and accurate information and/or by effacing erroneous information [22,53]. In other words, the technical model is adjusted to permanently altering conditions and develops continuously through learning, experience, or interaction with domains [19,22]. Differences in the struc- ture of explanations have an impact on the developing technical model of EEs [28]. Moreover, consideration of this technical model of EEs might enable the EX to give explanations that meet the needs of EEs. The following questions should help to illustrate what the technical model is embracing: \"What does the inter- locutor already know about a specific or similar domain in regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts?\" or \"Which knowledge does the interlocutor still need to acquire with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts?\" The technical model of the technological artifact is always perceived in terms of the dual nature of technological artifacts."}, {"title": "Interests within the Partner Model.", "content": "The EXs' partner models also include information regarding interests [20,25]. When going back to the statement that an EX needs to know what the EE wants to know, one could construe this in the following manner: \"What is the EE interested in?\". Interests play a pivotal role in explanations and have an impact on the direction an explanation takes."}, {"title": "The Technical Model and Interests in the Context of XAI-Research.", "content": "Considering all these aspects, it becomes obvious that explanations should be customized to the needs of EEs in terms of the dual nature of technological artifacts. Ideally, XAI would be able to react to changes of varying degrees in knowledge and shifting interests during co-constructive explanations and address Architecture or Relevance when required. Therefore, it is necessary to under- stand how the technical model within the partner model develops. In this study, we approach the EXs' assumptions regarding the EEs' technical model and inter- ests (see Fig. 1), which both are part of the partner model. We investigated what EXs assume and learn about EEs with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts, namely Architecture and Relevance. When EXs consider aspects that they learn about EEs, it might be beneficial to the overall explanation. The EXs' developing partner model might lead EXs through the explanation and to devel- oping a better understanding of EEs [35]. Because this also would hold true for explanations synthesized by XAI following this approach, the outcomes of this study are beneficial for XAI research and development. Then, working solutions toward the development of an advanced XAI that perceives and reacts to the knowledge and interests of EEs in a co-constructive manner could be realized in the future.\nIn our study, we investigated explanatory dialogues in which a simple techno- logical artifact served as the explanandum that is, the object of explanation. Further, we investigated how far EXs were aware of the knowledge and interests of EEs with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts. The overarching question was that we addressed was: What does the EX think the EE needs in particular moments of an explanation? Thus, the focus lies on the perspective of EXs regarding EEs. We aimed to answer the following research questions:\n(RQ1) How do the EX's assumptions regarding the EE's technical models of the technological artifact with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts develop during an explanation?\n(RQ2) How do the EX's assumptions regarding the EEs' interests in the technological artifact with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts develop during an explanation?\nTo answer these questions, we interviewed EXs to gain clarity on their assump- tions of EEs' knowledge and interests regarding the technological artifact.

This was done with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts in the context of naturalistic explanations. We designed a study in which we controlled specific variables, such as the location, explanandum (here we used the strategic game Quarto) and goal of the explanation. The study and pro- cedure were standardized after pilot studies and the instruments were further developed and fine-tuned. The interviews were analyzed following a qualitative content analysis [37] considering the two sides of the dual nature of technological artifacts: Architecture and Relevance as well as knowledge and interests.\nParticipants. Participants, EXs and EEs, were recruited for naturalistic ex- planations. The recruitment of participants followed a two-fold strategy: on-site recruitment and digital advertising. Communication with participants prior to the study ensured identical information for all participants. EXs were instructed to learn to play the game Quarto beforehand. This included familiarization with the game, playing the game, and explaining the game to others. EEs did not need to prepare for study participation. Both EXs and EEs needed to be proficient users of the German language, which is equivalent to C2 (CEFR). Permissions to conduct this study were granted by the Ethics Committee of Paderborn Uni- versity and data protection was ensured.\nWe investigated nine explanations in dyadic settings EXs (N=9). Participants were aged between 21 and 32 years (M=24.22, SD=3.46). Three females and six males participated as EXs.

Eight EXs were native speakers of the German language, while one EX was not a native speaker but had good command over the German language (C2).

In addition to merely playing Quarto, four EXs stated that they explained the game to others. The number of explanations given ranged from one to three.

In total, over 08:44 hh:mm of inter- view material was transcribed and a sufficient amount of data was available for analysis. As interviews were rich in content, qualitative content analysis [37]was opted. For transcribing and coding, MaxQDA software was utilized. The deduc- tive coding manual resulted from an in-depth study of relevant literature work and analysis of pilot studies. The coding manual provided a short overview of the characteristics of knowledge, interests, Architecture and Relevance and included typical examples in the form of direct quotes (see Table 1).\nIt was critical for the determination of segments which could vary in length from single words to whole sentences that one specific aspect addressed knowl- edge or interests [42].

In pre- interviews, the EXs' assumptions regarding the EEs' technical model of board games were mostly allocated to Architecture and to a lesser extent to Relevance. In the video recall-interviews in the start of explanations, EXs had limited as- sumptions regarding EEs' technical model of board games in general.

Hence, the EXs' assumptions regarding EEs' technical model were often influenced by common and individual knowledge EXs themselves had regarding games. On the Architecture side, EXs reported that EEs might know that board games usually have goals, are turn based, and include pieces. On the Relevance side, EXs mentioned that EEs might know that board games are typically played in a social context, that games are for teaching as well as learning, and that EEs knew how to develop and deploy strategies. From a general perspective on board games, incorporating both dual- ity sides, EXs stated that EEs might know diverse game genres and mentioned concrete examples. Even before the start of explanations, EXs appeared to nat- urally have relatively clear assumptions regarding EEs' technical models, which then were tested by EXs over the course of explanations, which led to a revised technical model.\nIn the video recall-interviews EXs were asked these questions: \"What aspects of Quarto does the EE not know yet?\" and \"How did the EE's understanding of Quarto develop in this particular moment?\" In video recall-interviews regarding the start of explanations, EXs' beliefs regarding EEs' technical models were"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "To be able to implement features of co-constructiveness in XAI it is necessary to learn more about naturalistic explanations among humans to fully understand how the EXs assumptions about the EEs' knowledge and interests develop. The importance of the dual nature theory for comprehensible explanations has been previously highlighted [49]. Thus, the focus of this paper was the investigation of assumptions of the EX regarding the knowledge and interests of the EE, with the introduction of the novel concept of technical models and interests within partner models with regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts [26]. How they developed throughout the explanation, from a vague and initial to a well-defined technical model and interests within the partner model after expla- nations, was empirically shown in this paper.\nAnswer to RQ1. (\"How do EX's assumptions regarding the EEs' technical models of the technological artifact in regard to the dual nature of technological artifacts develop during the explanation?\") We investigated which assumptions EXs had about EEs' technical model before, during, and after the explanation. The EXs spoke about assumptions they had about EEs' knowledge. In pre- interviews, it was remarkable how many assumptions, also concerning Relevance, EXs had about the hypothetical knowledge of EEs. These early assumptions of EXs were tested throughout the interaction and gradually added to a refined technical model within the partner model [22,53].\nOver the course of explanations, EXs' assumptions regarding the EEs' technical model developed.

It was evident that EXs in pre-interviews had rather strong assumptions about EEs' interests in board games, particularly on the Relevance side and noticeably fewer assumptions on an Architecture side. This supports the idea of a well-defined partner model in that matter. EXs emphasized that EEs would be particularly interested in the overall purpose of the technological artifact. One could argue that this would be an ideal starting point for an ex- planation. But this contradicts with what happened in the starting explanation, where the focus was set on the Architecture of particular components of the tech- nological artifact.

Close monitoring [6,8] of EEs through the consideration of multimodal behavior, questions and statements would be required.

Instruments were carefully developed in consideration of thematic and method- ological requirements. We ensured inter-subject comprehensibility of our study by documenting the research process (e.g., collection method, transcription rules, methods of analysis, and decisions regarding problems) and by discussing and interpreting data conjointly. Research assistants were well trained in conducting interviews, transcription, coding, as well in the technological execution of re- search. We stopped conducting studies after a clear picture of how the technical models and interest within the partner models developed was established. The rather small sample size was sufficient for our findings. Further, we also identified limitations regarding interests: Assumed interests in pre-interviews were ideas EXs had about what EEs would like, enjoy, or literally would be interested in. In video recall-interviews though, as explanations were compact and the explanan- dum straightforward, not all expressed interests [45] were interests in a narrow sense but were occasionally directly linked to the aspect that was explained in a particular moment. Hopefully, with more complex artifacts, we can better dif- ferentiate between different forms of interests. Then, it could be interesting to assess more diverse aspects of motivation in the partner model. Regardless of the fact that in interviews with open-ended questions, interviewees could explore the topic and generate rich and meaningful answers, it needs to be addressed that answers that are given depended on the questions and behavior of inter- viewers. The introspective video-recall method brought numerous advantages in the form of detailed insights on the EXs' developing assumptions regarding technical models and related interests of EEs in specific moments of the expla- nation.

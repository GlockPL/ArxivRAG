Addressing issues such as improving energy efficiency, reducing latency, enhancing cross-platform collaboration, and optimizing toolchains will be key to the future development of AI hardware architectures."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Performance Bottlenecks in AI Model Training and Inference", "content": "Computational Power. Current AI models, particularly deep learning models, require increasing computational power year by year due to the growing size of datasets and the increasing complexity of the models. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 model, which has 175 billion parameters, requires nearly hundreds of Petaflops of computational power during training. Existing hardware architectures, such as NVIDIA's A100 GPU and Google's TPU v4, provide significant acceleration for large-scale computation tasks, but their computational power is still insufficient to meet the demands of increasingly large models. For instance, the NVIDIA A100 GPU has a peak floating-point performance of 312 teraflops (TFLOPS), yet when dealing with very deep neural networks, the computational load often exceeds the capability of a single accelerator, leading to bottlenecks and inefficient hardware resource utilization. Particularly in large-scale neural network training, the computational power of a single accelerator is inadequate to maintain efficient data processing speeds, resulting in substantial idle hardware resources and reduced training efficiency.\nMemory Bandwidth and Latency. The processing of large datasets in AI training and inference depends heavily on efficient memory access and data transfer. However, memory bandwidth and latency have become critical bottlenecks that limit performance improvements. For example, the NVIDIA A100 GPU has a memory bandwidth of 1555GB/s, but when faced with large neural networks, this is still insufficient to support the frequent access to numerous parameters and data during training. In BERT model training, for instance, while the model itself has a smaller parameter size (110 million parameters), the large amount of intermediate data that needs to be read and written to memory causes memory bandwidth to become a performance bottleneck. Moreover, memory latency significantly impacts the efficiency of large-scale AI model inference. For deep neural networks with billions of parameters, frequent memory accesses cause high latency as the computing cores wait for data, leading to reduced overall inference performance.\nEnergy Efficiency Issues. As AI models continue to scale up, energy efficiency becomes an increasingly critical issue. Although current AI accelerators have made significant advancements in computational performance, improvements in energy efficiency have been insufficient. For example, the power consumption of the NVIDIA A100 GPU is around 400W, and despite this power consumption, it still cannot meet the needs of large-scale AI training. According to research by DeepMind, the energy consumption required to train the GPT-3 model is approximately 1280 MWh, equivalent to the electricity usage of a typical household over ten years. This indicates that, while computational power continues to increase, energy efficiency remains a significant barrier to achieving sustainable development in AI hardware, particularly when deploying AI tasks in large-scale cloud computing centers where the balance between energy efficiency and cost is especially prominent."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Lack of Heterogeneity and Adaptability in Hardware Architectures", "content": "Challenges of Hardware Heterogeneity. The diverse demands of AI training and inference have led to the heterogeneity of hardware architectures, but the coordination between different hardware architectures remains a pressing issue. Existing hardware architectures, such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs, each have distinct computational characteristics and advantages, but their integration and efficient collaboration face many challenges. For example, while GPUs excel at large-scale parallel computing, CPUs or FPGAs may be more efficient for certain AI tasks (e.g., processing small data streams). Traditional AI accelerators such as TPUs are designed specifically for deep learning training and inference, but they tend to perform poorly in more general-purpose computing tasks. Differences in resource scheduling, data sharing, and synchronization mechanisms between various hardware platforms make cross-platform cooperation complex, thereby impacting overall system computational efficiency and resource utilization.\nArchitectural Adaptability. Different AI application scenarios (e.g., image recognition, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) impose significantly different requirements on hardware architectures, which limits the versatility of a single hardware architecture. For instance, image processing tasks often require a large number of convolution operations and matrix computations, which are well-suited for execution on GPUs or TPUs. On the other hand, natural language processing tasks rely more on sequential data processing, which demands different memory bandwidth and processor architecture. Reinforcement learning tasks may require fast feedback mechanisms and low-latency computational environments. Therefore, a single hardware architecture is unlikely to meet the demands of all AI tasks, and the adaptability of hardware architectures becomes a major limiting factor for the expansion of AI applications.

Many AI development tools, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, offer support for existing GPUs and TPUs but provide limited support for emerging architectures like RISC-V. This results in developers facing steep learning curves and adaptation work when developing on these platforms. Additionally, current compilers and schedulers often fail to fully optimize hardware resources, preventing AI accelerators from reaching their full computational potential.\nLack of Hardware-Software Synergy There is a lack of tight synergy between existing hardware architectures and system software, particularly in emerging AI accelerators and system architectures (e.g., RISC-V-based designs), where hardware and software optimization is often disjointed, leading to suboptimal performance.

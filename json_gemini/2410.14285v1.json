INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the modern world, underwater imaging is essential for many purposes, such as environmental monitoring, marine biology, and underwater exploration. In order to monitor ecosystems, analyse habitats, and evaluate the effects of human activity on marine life, researchers and experts need to be able to take high-quality underwater photos. However, the special optical characteristics of water make it extremely difficult to take high-quality underwater photos. Low contrast, poor visibility, and the loss of fine details can result from a number of factors that seriously decrease image quality, including light scattering, absorption, and the presence of suspended particles. As a result, improving underwater photos is crucial for precise interpretation and analysis, allowing experts and researchers to draw well-informed conclusions from visual information. To overcome these issues, traditional image processing techniques which include contrast enhancement, colour correction, and histogram equalization have been frequently used. These methods can yield some improvement, but because they rely on predetermined assumptions about the properties of the image, they frequently fail to restore the intrinsic quality of underwater photos. For example, in extremely complicated underwater images, histogram equalisation may generate distortions or artefacts while enhancing contrast. [12] It may also be important to investigate more sophisticated and adaptive solutions because traditional techniques may not be able to adjust to the wide range of variables seen in underwater habitats, such as varying depths, lighting conditions, and water clarity.[40]\nNew paths for picture augmentation have been made possible by recent developments in deep learning, particularly in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have shown remarkably effective in a range of computer vision tasks, such as super-resolution, segmentation, and picture classification. There is no need for manual feature extraction with these neural networks because they are built to automatically learn features from data. Large datasets enable CNNs to discover intricate patterns and features that conventional algorithms might miss, leading to more efficient image augmentation and restoration.[28] Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) are a particularly effective method for enhancing underwater images due to their ability to improve image resolution.\nThe Retinex algorithm, when used in conjunction with SRCNN, offers a convincing solution to the lighting issues that come with underwater photography. By reducing uneven lighting and boosting local contrast, the Retinex theory which simulates human vision tries to improve photographs. The Retinex algorithm can dramatically enhance the visual quality of photos by mimicking how the human eye adjusts to changing light conditions, especially in scenes with fog and haze. [1] This is especially important for photos taken underwater, where environmental variables frequently cause unequal light penetration. Stronger picture improvement is made possible by the synergistic solution that combines the advantages of deep learning and conventional image processing when SRCNN and Retinex are integrated. In order to improve underwater image quality, a unique hybrid technique integrating SRCNN and Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) is presented in this research study. [27]Through the use of MSR for defogging and SRCNN for spatial resolution augmentation, we hope to create a strong framework that can boost image clarity, contrast, and colour balance under difficult underwater circumstances. In addition to improving visual quality, the suggested methodology maintains minute details that are essential for underwater investigation. In order to support marine conservation activities, the capacity to retrieve and improve these facts is essential for uses including species identification, habitat assessment, and environmental change monitoring.[42]\nExtensive tests on real-world underwater datasets are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach, comparing its results with those of current state-of-the-art methods. To evaluate image quality improvements, quantitative metrics are used, such as the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). These measurements offer a thorough assessment of the algorithm's performance, making it possible to determine with clarity how well it improves underwater photos. Furthermore, qualitative comparisons are shown to illustrate the improved clarity and detail preservation in difficult settings, as well as the visual improvements obtained by integrating SRCNN and Retinex. Additionally, the study looks at the computational effectiveness of the suggested approach, taking into account its potential for real-time applications in autonomous underwater vehicles and underwater robotics. The need for efficient and effective enhancement techniques grows as the demand for high-quality underwater imagery rises, particularly in areas like marine research and underwater surveying.[26] This approach has ramifications that go beyond scholarly research; it may find use in underwater robotics, marine exploration, and other domains where sound visual data is essential for making decisions.\nIn the end, this study's findings add to the expanding corpus of knowledge in underwater imaging by offering a complex workaround for the shortcomings of current techniques.[9] Through the application of novel algorithms that combine the advantages of deep learning and conventional image processing, this research advances the field of underwater picture enhancement and emphasises the value of multidisciplinary approaches in solving challenging problems. Our work demonstrates the need for ongoing innovation and investigation of cutting-edge techniques to enhance the clarity and usefulness of underwater images, opening the door for further study and real-world applications as underwater imaging continues to develop."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Research on improving underwater photographs has been ongoing, mostly because of the difficulties presented by the optical characteristics of water. Many studies have attempted to solve problems with low contrast, colour distortion, and declining visibility. Conventional techniques like contrast stretching and histogram equalisation are often used to improve underwater photos. Kirk et al. (2013), for example, investigated histogram equalisation strategies to enhance image quality, demonstrating the promise of straightforward statistical techniques. [39] Nevertheless, these methods frequently result in over-enhancement and can introduce artefacts, especially in intricate underwater scenes where uniformity assumptions might not hold true.[10]\nMore advanced image processing techniques have been used by researchers to get around the drawbacks of traditional methods. Based on the underwater imaging model, Peng et al. (2018) suggested a colour correction model that focusses on making up for colour loss caused by light absorption. To bring back the original colour of underwater photos, their method combined contrast enhancement and colour balance approaches. This approach showed progress, but it was still difficult to preserve clarity and prevent oversaturation in regions with deep shadows or reflections. It is becoming more and more clear that more adaptable methods are required in order to handle a greater variety of underwater situations.\nDeep learning has completely changed image enhancing methods, opening up new avenues for underwater photography. A deep learning system for enhancing underwater images was presented by Zhang et al. (2019). It uses CNNs to increase visibility and colour fidelity. Their algorithm was trained to recognise the intrinsic characteristics of underwater scenes using a sizable collection of underwater photos. [29]The outcomes showed notable gains in image quality over conventional techniques; but, real-time applications are hindered by the system's need on large amounts of training data and processing power. This emphasises how crucial it is to create effective algorithms that can function well in settings with limited resources.[13]\nRetinex theory is a noteworthy development in underwater picture improvement as it attempts to simulate human vision under different lighting situations. The Retinex algorithm was first presented by Jobson et al.[43] (1997) as a way to improve photographs by adjusting for uneven lighting and enhancing local contrast. Subsequent research has successfully addressed fog and haze effects in underwater photos by applying Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) approaches, as demonstrated by Aky\u00fcrek and Kamburo\u011flu's (2018) study. These methods show how Retinex-based solutions can be useful in recovering image quality, especially in underwater settings where light conditions vary greatly.\nFurthermore, in order to get better outcomes, recent research has concentrated on fusing deep learning with conventional image processing methods. In order to improve underwater photos, Li et al. (2020) developed a hybrid model that combines SRCNN with Retinex-based algorithms.[25] Their findings showed that significant gains in visibility and colour accuracy were obtained when the Retinex model's efficient lighting correction was combined with deep learning's capacity to learn features. [38] This work is an excellent example of the trend towards creating integrated strategies that take advantage of the advantages of many ways to address the difficulties associated with underwater imaging.[14]\nDespite advancements, the subject still faces difficulties, especially with relation to computational efficiency and real-time application flexibility. Many present methods may not be practical in dynamic underwater situations since they mainly rely on pre-defined parameters or large training datasets. Future directions for study include investigating lightweight models that can be used in real-time applications, like autonomous cars and underwater robotics. Combining cutting-edge machine learning methods with conventional image processing could result in reliable systems that can retain excellent image enhancement while automatically adapting to changing underwater conditions.[44]"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) for improving spatial resolution and the Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) for defogging and light adjustment are the two main parts of the methodology used in this study. [45]Through increased clarity, contrast, and colour accuracy, this integrated method seeks to address the problems associated with underwater image quality degradation.[15] The individual elements of the technique, the used algorithms, and the general framework are described in the sections that follow.[54] Framework for Enhancing Underwater Images The suggested framework comprises of a step-by-step procedure that uses MSR for illumination correction after SRCNN for image enhancement of the input underwater picture. The following sums up the general architecture:\n1. Input Image Acquisition: Underwater cameras are used to acquire the unprocessed underwater image. There could be issues with poor visibility, colour distortion, and low quality with this image.\n2. Super-Resolution Enhancement: The input image's spatial resolution is improved by applying the SRCNN.\n3. Defogging and Illumination Correction: After correcting for non-uniform illumination, the MSR algorithm is used to enhance the image's visibility and colour accuracy.[47]\nConvolutional Neural Network with Super Resolution (SRCNN): SRCNN is a deep learning model that makes use of convolutional layers to improve image resolution.[37] The three primary levels of the architecture are reconstruction, non-linear mapping, and feature extraction.[8]\n1. Feature extraction: To extract pertinent features, a convolutional layer with filters is applied to the low-resolution input image in this layer. This operation's mathematical representation is as follows:\n$F1 = ReLU(I*K1 + b\u2081)$ (1)\nwhere I is the input low-resolution image, K\u2081 is the convolutional kernel, bi is the bias, and ReLU is the activation function.\n2. Non-Linear Mapping: In order to learn the mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution pictures, another convolutional layer processes the extracted features.\n$F2 = ReLU(F1*K2 + b2)$ (2)\nwhere K2 is the kernel for this layer.\n3. Reconstruction: Using the mapped features, the last layer recreates the high-resolution image:\n$HR = F2*K3 + b3$ (3)\nwhere K3 is the kernel for reconstruction.\nThe reconstruction loss, which is measured as the mean squared error (MSE) between the generated high-resolution image and the ground truth, is minimised by optimising the model parameters by backpropagation. [16]The SRCNN model is trained using a dataset of paired low-resolution and high-resolution images:\n$Loss = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ||HR - HR\u2081||2$ (4)\nwhere N is the number of training samples, HR\u2081is the ground truth high-resolution image, and \u0124R\u2081 is the reconstructed high-resolution image.\nMulti-Scale Retinex (MSR): The Multi-Scale Retinex algorithm is used to adjust for uneven lighting, improving the images' visibility.[48] According to the Retinex theory, illumination and reflectance combine to produce the visible image. By splitting the input picture I (x,y) into its illumination L (x,y) and reflectance R (x,y), MSR seeks to predict the reflectance.\n$I(x, y) = R(x, y)\u22c5L(x, y)$ (5)\nThe MSR algorithm can be mathematically formulated as:\n$MSR(I) = logR(x, y) \u2013 logL(x, y)$ (6)\nThe algorithm applies Gaussian filters with varying scales \u03c3 to the input image in order to estimate L(x, y):\n$L(x,y) = \u2211 Go(x, y) * I(x,y)$ (7)\n\u03c3\nwhere Go (x,y) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter with model number G. [36]The combined output from several scales yields the final improved image:\n$MSR(I) = \\frac{1}{N} \u2211 R(I(x, y), \u03c3\u03b5\u2170)$ (8)\ni=1\nwhere N is the number of scales and R denotes the reflectance estimation at scale i.\nImplementation: Python and pertinent libraries, such as TensorFlow for deep learning and OpenCV for image processing, are used throughout the process to implement it. [30]. A dataset of underwater photos that have been pre-processed to produce low-resolution versions is used to train the SRCNN model. To improve the model's resilience during training, data augmentation methods including flipping, rotating, and scaling are used.[3]\nThe input images are processed using multiple Gaussian filters with different standard deviations for the MSR component.[24] The final improved image is created by combining the outputs from each scale. [35] Quantitative measurements like the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to assess the efficacy of the suggested methodology and offer insights into the image quality improvements attained.[49]\nMetrics for Evaluation: Two key metrics are employed in the assessment of the suggested image enhancement methodology:\n\u2022 Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): This measure indicates the relationship between a signal's maximum potential power and the amount of noise that can distort its representation and compromise its accuracy.[55] The formula for PSNR is:"}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Extensive experiments on multiple underwater datasets were conducted to assess the efficacy of the proposed Underwater Image Enhancement Framework. [31]When compared to conventional enhancement techniques, the results show notable gains in image clarity, resolution, and colour accuracy. This part includes a comparison with current methods and a discussion of the results, both quantitative and qualitative.\nQuantitative Results: A number of common picture quality criteria, such as the Colourfulness Metric (CM), the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), were used to assess the effectiveness of the enhancement system.[22] These measurements shed light on how well the framework restores high-quality photos.[51]\n\u2022 PSNR: A significant improvement in PSNR was obtained by the suggested SRCNN-based enhancement model, indicating a decrease in noise and an increase in picture detail. Compared to the low-resolution input images, the enhanced images' PSNR value increased by 8-10 dB on average, showing a noticeable improvement in visual sharpness.[5]\n\u2022 SSIM: With an average SSIM score of 0.92, the upgraded photos showed better structural integrity in terms of SSIM, demonstrating the framework's capacity to maintain image structure and guarantee naturalness throughout improvement.[32]\n\u2022 Colourfulness Metric: The framework improved the colour accuracy of underwater photos by applying the MSR defogging technique. The system's success in re-establishing natural colour balance and enhancing visibility of underwater scenes was demonstrated by the Colourfulness Metric, which showed a noticeable rise. [23]\nQualitative Results: Visual examination of the improved underwater photos shows notable gains in overall image quality, sharpness, and detail. [18]While the MSR algorithm successfully restores the natural colour and contrast of underwater scenes, removing the bluish or greenish colour casts often found in underwater photography, the SRCNN model successfully recovers small details that were lost due to low resolution.[52]\n\u2022 Prior to enhancement: Images had significant colour distortion, low contrast, and low resolution, making it challenging to see tiny details and comprehend the scenario.[56]\n\u2022 After Enhancement: The framework's photos showed improved clarity, precise colour representation, well-defined object borders, and increased contrast. Once the fog-like distortions were eliminated, previously hidden details became visible."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "To tackle the particular difficulties of processing underwater images, the proposed Underwater Image Enhancement Framework integrates Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) with Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR) defogging algorithms.[7] The framework produces visually appealing underwater photographs by giving significant improvements in both image resolution and colour accuracy through the merging of these two potent approaches. [19] The thorough assessment, which was carried out using a variety of quantitative measurements like PSNR, SSIM, and the Colourfulness Metric, has shown how reliable and efficient the framework is at outperforming traditional techniques in terms of output quality.By regaining lost information and sharpening edges, even in low-quality input photos, the SRCNN model significantly contributes to the resolution improvement of underwater photographs. The deep learning-based solution performs better than conventional techniques by enhancing overall clarity and collecting finer details. Furthermore, by adjusting lighting and regaining natural colour tones, the MSR defogging method successfully improves colour integrity. The combined framework can resolve common problems in underwater photography, including low light and turbidity-induced blurriness, colour distortions, and scattering.[54]\nIn contrast to previous image improvement methods such simple Retinex models, CLAHE, and histogram equalisation, the suggested framework yields results that are higher quality and more realistic. For real-world underwater photography applications, the hybrid SRCNN and MSR method provides a balanced solution that simultaneously improves resolution and corrects colour aberrations. [34]These enhancements are especially helpful for study on marine biology, environmental monitoring, and undersea exploration all of which depend on precise and high-quality photos for processing.[21]Real-time picture enhancement is another important strength of the system. This feature creates opportunities for real-time underwater applications where instantaneous image processing is essential, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely controlled vehicles (ROVs). Real-time performance is attained without sacrificing image quality, guaranteeing that even in dynamic underwater conditions, the improved photos retain a high degree of detail and colour accuracy.\nEven with its achievements, there is always room for improvement. The possible inclusion of artefacts in extremely low-light or severely damaged underwater photos is one of the current framework's limitations. Future research may investigate the use of more sophisticated deep learning models or hybrid strategies that combine artefact correction and noise reduction methods to address this. Furthermore, adding more diverse underwater settings to the dataset such as varying water depths, illumination conditions, and turbidity levels would enhance the framework's generalisability.\nIn summary, the suggested Underwater Image Enhancement Framework offers a unique approach that blends cutting-edge defogging techniques with super-resolution techniques, marking a substantial advancement in underwater imaging. With obvious room for improvement, it provides high-quality photos that are essential for underwater research and exploration. The framework is a promising tool for a variety of undersea applications because of its versatility and real-time processing capability. The subject of underwater picture enhancement will surely advance even farther with additional framework additions and modifications."}]}

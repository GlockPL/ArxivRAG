The infrastructure damage includes the 87% of housing units, 80% of public buildings and 60% of cropland 17 out of 36 hospitals, 68% of road networks and 87% of school buildings damaged. This conflict has as well launched an online discussion across various social media platforms, including Twitter and Reddit. Telegram was no exception due to its encrypted communication and highly involved audience. The current study will cover an analysis of the related discussion in relation to different participants of the conflict and sentiment represented in those discussion. To this end, we prepared a dataset of 125K messages shared on channels in Telegram spanning from 23 October 2025 until today. Additionally, we apply the same analysis in two publicly available datasets from Twitter containing 2001 tweets and from Reddit containing 2M opinions. We apply a volume analysis across the three datasets, entity extraction and then proceed to BERT topic analysis in order to extract common themes or topics. Next, we apply sentiment analysis to analyze the emotional tone of the discussions. Our findings hint at polarized narratives as the hallmark of how political factions and outsiders mold public opinion. We also analyze the sentiment-topic prevalence relationship, detailing the trends that may show manipulation and attempts of propaganda by the involved parties. This will give a better understanding of the online discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict and contribute to the knowledge on the dynamics of social media communication during geopolitical crises.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has persisted for over a century, with notable events ranging from the United Nations' 1947 Partition Plan, through the Yom Kippur War in 1973, to the recent outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in October 2023. The recent ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict continued to dominate discussions across social media platforms, particularly Twitter and Telegram, where communities engage in sharing perspectives, news, and narratives. This study aims to analyze the conversations surrounding this conflict by applying advanced analytical techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic analysis, and sentiment analysis, on a dataset obtained from Telegram, along with publicly available datasets from Twitter and Reddit."}, {"title": "Contributions", "content": "\u2022 Dataset Compilation and Analysis. The study presents a unique dataset of over 125K Telegram messages, collected between 2023 and 2025, focusing on discussions about the Israeli-Hamas conflict. Also we include two publicly available datasets from Twitter containing 2001 tweets and from Reddit containing 2M opinions. Thesw datasets are analyzed for volume trends, sentiment, and topics using advanced techniques, which adds significant value to the understanding of how such discussions unfold in encrypted social platforms during geopolitical crises.\n\u2022 Sentiment-Topic Prevalence Analysis This paper contributes a detailed sentiment-topic prevalence analysis using LDA and BERTopic. It helps reveal how emotional tones (positive, neutral, negative) align with specific topics, such as humanitarian concerns, political divisions, or propaganda efforts during the conflict. Such sentiment-based topic analysis is crucial for identifying manipulation or polarized narratives\n\u2022 Application of Advanced NLP Models. The use of cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) models like BERTopic and sentiment analysis models allows for nuanced analysis of textual data. This methodological contribution improves the quality of analysis by ensuring that both topics and emotional tones are accurately captured across a large dataset.\n\u2022 Influence on Policy and Social Media Governance. The findings regarding how narratives are shared and shaped on Telegram during the war could influence future policies on social media governance. The paper's results on the effectiveness of content moderation and the spread of information (and misinformation) could inform social media platforms' strategies during conflicts.\nThese contributions provide a comprehensive analysis of how the Israeli-Hamas conflict is discussed on Telegram, combining data-driven approaches with important geopolitical and social insights."}, {"title": "1.1 The landscape of Telegram, Twitter and Reddit on Palestine", "content": "Telegram is one of the most important sources providing insights on the subject of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and consequently a significant source of real-time data analysis; many participants and observers of the conflict use Telegram for quick communication but also considering its encrypted communication, given the restricted locations. Especially in groups or activities that are highly political or keen on violence, there is a preference for the use of Telegram for its encryption. It is this regulated space that impairs full participation and hence is useful for the analysis of unfiltered views among the population.\nHowever, the landscape of Telegram channels has significantly changed in the last few months, particularly due to the ongoing war in Palestine. Since the October 7 attack by Hamas, the use of Telegram on both sides has increased measurably among Israelis and Palestinians. It became one of the prominent channels through which information, propaganda, and live updates were passed around regarding the war. This in turn saw the emergence of new and much larger channels.\nOn the other hand, there have also been some remarkable limitations. Because Telegram's management was under increasing pressure with regard to content moderation, especially by Hamas, after some initial refusals to ban channels, it did implement measures to limit access to Hamas channels on platforms such as Google Play due to its app store guidelines.\nAs of late October, there were reportedly channels affiliated with Hamas that were blocked or made less accessible, at least on cell-phones, but such efforts have tended to be quite half-hearted as many users still find ways to access this content a very complex interplay between censorship and demand for such information. However, the situation is fluid: some channels have appeared only recently, while others have been shuttered or buried deep due to these regulatory efforts. That would only point out that the current trend reflects the continuing challenge of content moderation on such"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Similar works analyzing discourse on social media with regard to the Israel-Palestine conflict serve to highlight the dynamics of public sentiment and the forces of influence at play.\nIn [1] in a Telegram dataset of 27.8K channels and 317M messages from 2.2M unique users, the authors apply message frequency patterns and identifying key trends in channel activity over time. The dataset consists a wide-ranging corpus of messages from extremist groups, political movements, and discussions about cryptocurrency among other subjects. This makes it a rich source for the analysis of disinformation, scams, and political protests. Although this dataset was collected using snowball sampling, it is very comprehensive because data collection was a long-term process. The paper argues that the dataset will contribute significantly to research on computer-mediated communication and the use of platforms like Telegram in various global contexts.\nThe study in [2] examines the process of narrative construction on social media during critical junctures, utilizing sentiment analysis as a way to show how public opinion is framed and subsequently manipulated by political groupings.

By contrast, modern transformers have revolutionized the NLP landscape and taken topic modeling to the next level with semantic relationship capturing possible with models such as BERTopic. This algorithm uses embeddings from BERT in a combination with class-based TF-IDF for the generation of interpretable and coherent topics; hence, it is a very powerful tool in practical applications for document analysis. In general, BERTopic simplifies topic modeling by efficiently identifying topics and their probabilities within documents. Considering this we proceed with comprehensive textual data analysis using methods of natural language processing combined with machine learning, using BERTopic.\nWe use the Bert topic library applied in topic modeling that enables generating topics from text by making use of transformers and traditional machine learning methods such as Count Vectorizer. The Count Vectorizer, a scikit-learn tool is used to transform our dataset into a matrix of token count. The Sentence Transformer (MiniLM), a transformer-based model is loaded for the embedding of text. We process the corpus by initially cleaning the text (removing URLs, special characters, and lowercasing), and store the cleaned messages in a pandas DataFrame. The train_model() method uses BERTopic, a topic modeling library, to discover topics from the messages using a count-based vectorizer that considers n-grams. The analyze_topics() method analyzes the discovered topics, extracting key words for each topic and calculating topic distribution across different channels and over time.\nSpecifically, we analyze 51403 out of 70321 messages because we remove duplicates and non-text messages, from 17 channelsfrom telegram, and proceed to the training of the topic model, transforming documents to embeddings, using PyTorch cuda Next we load the pretrained SentenceTransformer: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 with"}, {"title": "5.3.3 Twitter", "content": "We apply the same topic analysis on the Twitter dataset using the BERTopic model. Initially, we preprocess the messages, train a topic model, and generate the most relevant topic. Additionally, weo analyze the topic distribution across different channels and timestamps. The results are shown in the following graphs 13, 14 and 15. In figure 13 we show a visualization of the topic similarity network, showing relations between the various topics of discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It looks dominated by terms about the military features of the conflict: \"brigades\", \"soldiers\", and \"storming\", among geographic places such as \"Jerusalem\" and \"Gaza\". From the above, it follows that operational details in general and in regard to military operations are stressed.\nAnother cluster is very different, with more humanitarian and civilian issues, including phrases like \"children injured\", \"southern forces\", and \"occupied Jerusalem\". This would show discussions of the human impact and civilian suffering caused by the conflict. More thematic sets are also related to wider geopolitical themes, such as \"farewell\", \"palestinian girl\", and further some international actors and media. It shows that the conflict is debated within a framing of the wide regional and global context. The network visual representation really depicts an overview of all military, humanitarian, and political features that are involved and represented with respect to the discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the form of such a massive web about a long and highly debated discussion."}, {"title": "6 Sentiment Analysis", "content": "We perform sentiment analysis on our Twitter corpus using the Hugging Face transformers library.

An analysis of 105,000 messages on Telegram, 2,001 tweets, and 2 million opinions sourced from Reddit, several patterns materialized during our analysis with great importance to this online discursive exchange. Frequency analysis showed the volume of the messages increased dramatically after events on October 7, 2023; this is mainly reflected in several channels. Following this, entity extraction identified the key themes and players. Advanced NLP techniques applied herein include topic modeling, which, through means such as LDA and BERTopic analysis, demonstrated eight major topic clusters on humanitarian concerns to military operations. Our topic modeling showed that 19% of the discussions talked about general Palestinian issues; 17.9% of the discussions were about geographical and humanitarian aspects, while the remaining ones were composed of international discourses, French language communications, regional actors, and military operations. SA showed highly polarized emotional responses across platforms. Granular emotion analysis, in particular, presented that the dominant emotions expressed in messages, especially in channels focused on direct conflict reporting, are those of anger and fear. This emotive polarization strongly seems to correlate with specific topics and events. Hence, information sharing may be in complex interaction with emotive responses. Key implications:\nPlatform Dynamics: Indeed, Telegram is used as a main communication platform in a conflict situation; this however is subject to considerable limitations through content moderation efforts. Information Flow: The study shows how different narratives evolve and spread across channels, with some topics coming to the fore based on real-world events. Emotional Impact: The dominance of negative sentiments, especially that of anger and fear, calls for an urgent requirement of understanding how digital platforms shape conflict perception and emotional response. Methodological Contributions:\nCombined used of LDA and BERTopic analysis thus offers a robust framework in analyzing complex and multilingual discourse during ongoing conflicts.\nFuture studies could thus be informed by longer-term trends, the impact of content moderation on information flow, and more sophisticated methods for detecting and analyzing propaganda efforts. Moreover, comparative studies across different conflicts"}, {"title": "8 Appendix", "content": ""}, {"title": "8.1 Additional volume plots", "content": ""}]}

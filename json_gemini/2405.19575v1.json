This paper presents a novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model tailored for aspect and polarity classification in Hausa movie reviews, an underrepresented language with limited resources and presence in sentiment analysis research. One of the primary implications of this work is the creation of a comprehensive Hausa ABSA dataset, which addresses a significant gap in the availability of resources for sentiment analysis in underrepresented languages. This dataset fosters a more inclusive sentiment analysis landscape and advances research in languages with limited resources. The collected dataset was first preprocessed using sci-kit-learn to perform TF-IDF transformation for extracting feature word vector weights. Aspect-level feature ontology words within the analyzed text were derived, and the ontology of the reviewed text was manually annotated, along with corresponding sentiment analysis polarity assignments. The proposed model was developed by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with an attention mechanism to aid in aspect-word prediction. The model utilizes sentences from the corpus and feature words as vector inputs to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed model leverages the advantages of the convolutional and attention layers to extract contextual information and sentiment polarities from Hausa movie reviews. Its excellent performance demonstrates the applicability of such models to underrepresented languages. With 91% accuracy on aspect term extraction and 92% on sentiment polarity classification, the model excels in aspect identification and sentiment analysis, offering insights into specific aspects of interest and their associated sentiments. Moreover, the proposed model outperformed traditional machine models in both aspect-word and polarity prediction. This study, through the creation of the Hausa ABSA dataset and the development of an effective model, significantly advances ABSA research and has wide-ranging implications for the sentiment analysis field in the context of underrepresented languages and cross-cultural linguistic research.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the realm of natural language processing, our study delves into the realm of aspect-based sentiment analysis within the context of the Hausa language-a domain characterized by scarce linguistic resources. Our core aim is to harness the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as formidable tools to dissect sentimental nuances[1]. Recent work serves as an example of this pursuit. Despite the constraints imposed by scarce linguistic resources, our endeavor is driven by the desire to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy. Through this, we seek to illuminate the intricate interplay of sentiments across diverse dimensions. Our goal is to unravel the dynamics of sentiment within this resource-constrained language, ultimately deepening our understanding of Hausa's distinctive linguistic and cultural context.\nIn today's digital age, users of movie streaming platforms like Amazon Movies, Netflix, and YouTube have a plethora of means to express their opinions via comments and rating systems. These opinions encapsulate a spectrum of sentiments ranging from positive to negative. Businesses leverage data mining techniques to comprehend these sentiments, thereby improving customer experiences and catering to their prefer-ences. However, the inherent complexities arise from factors like misspelled words, abbreviations, emoticons, and slang. Consequently, selecting an optimal opinion mining method becomes pivotal in generating precise user sentiment [2].\nSentiment analysis (SA) constitutes a computational ap-proach to discerning and categorizing opinions expressed in text, intending to determine whether the writer's opinion about a particular subject or product is positive, negative, or neutral. Within the broader context of behavioral science, SA serves as a fundamental tool for interpreting and classifying emotions across diverse domains [3]. This branch of analysis delves into people's sentiments, beliefs, views, and feelings regarding products and services, topics, events, and their respective attributes [4].\nWhile existing studies have examined sentiment analysis in Hausa, a low-resource language, with a primary focus on sentiment analysis within an entire document [3], [5]\u2013[8], this research introduces a novel dimension by venturing into Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) using a dataset generated from Hausa YouTube comments. Our pioneering approach aims to provide sentiment analysis at the word level,"}, {"title": "A. Background", "content": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves the task of discerning the sentiment associated with a particular term within a text. It can be regarded as an advanced form of sentiment analysis, where the key aim is to recognize specific aspect terms within the provided reviews and anticipate the sentiments linked with those distinct aspects. The initial step in conducting ABSA is known as Aspect Term Extraction (ATE), wherein the phrases that represent the core subjects of opinions within a review are identified [9]. To illustrate, consider the review: \"I appreciate the scene and the producer's choice of soundtrack.\" In this case, the terms \"scene\" and \"producer\" will be extracted as aspect terms, and their sentiment will be determined by the presence of the opinion word \"appreciate\".\nThis process constitutes the second subtask of ABSA, known as Aspect Term Sentiment Classification (ATSC).\nATE task was considered by some researchers to be a sequential modeling problem where a sentence is modeled as a set of tokens. Various algorithms, ranging from Support Vector Machines (SVM) [10], [11] for ATE to Attention-based LSTM for ATSC[12], have been proposed to facilitate ABSA's accurate execution.\nA considerable range of methods for sentiment analysis across different domains already exists [13]\u2013[15]. The majority of these existing studies mainly concentrate on identifying sentiments at the textual level [16] or in a single sentence [17]. However, these approaches often fall short of providing the specific and detailed insights users seek from reviews, particularly regarding individual aspects, features, or attributes of a product or service. For example, consider a user review \"I enjoyed the movie, but the character was annoying\". This demonstrates how viewers can have varied perspectives, where their focus might be on the quality of the movie while at the same time being annoyed by the actor. Hence, it becomes pivotal to gauge sentiments about distinct aspects, a task referred to as aspect-based analysis.\nABSA holds the promise of transforming sentiment analysis from a broad perspective to a granular level, offering a more specific understanding of opinions. By analyzing sentiments at the aspect or feature level, ABSA empowers businesses to gain actionable insights from customer feedback. This fine-grained approach not only aids in pinpointing areas of improvement but also enhances market research, competitive analysis, and domain-specific sentiment understanding. ABSA's potential extends beyond industries; it facilitates personalized recom-mendations, guides product development, and enables timely responses to evolving sentiment trends. The insights drawn from ABSA support evidence-based decision-making in policy and regulations, ensuring that public sentiments are understood and considered. Making it an important tool for understanding and harnessing sentiments in diverse contexts.\nOne of the major challenges of ABSA in low-resource lan-guages is the absence of rich and diverse datasets. Additional challenges include developing a high-quality labeled dataset for training the ABSA model and the scarcity of domain-specific annotated data. Extending ABSA-trained models to different languages, as in the case of multilingual models, also presents difficulties in handling linguistic variations, idiomatic expressions, and sentiment lexicons across diverse languages. Therefore, collecting datasets for each language and training the ABSA model on language-specific datasets is vital to achieving accurate results.\nABSA is a subtask of sentiment analysis that identifies the sentiment of a sentence or phrase at the aspect level. This is important for low-resource languages like Hausa because it allows us to gain insights into the sentiment of people about specific aspects of a product or service, even when there is limited data available."}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "This literature review aims to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art methods and recent developments in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis(ABSA) techniques. ABSA evolved naturally as an extension of sentiment analysis to address the need for a more fine-grained analysis of senti-ments concerning specific aspects or features. Although many researchers contributed to the development of ABSA, each tried to address a drawback of traditional SA.\nABSA is a specialized area of sentiment analysis that focuses on extracting sentiment information at the aspect level from text [18]. ABSA has been an improvement over the traditional method of sentiment analysis, in which texts are classified as positive or negative only without consid-ering contextual information[19]. ABSA can be formulated in different ways and techniques;[20] conducted a thorough survey of ABSA highlighting challenges and methodologies in aspect-based sentiment analysis. The authors further proposed a technique for identifying aspects and associating sentiments. [21] proposed a technique called the rating regression ap-proach, where aspects are identified and rated by a given score. The mathematical model clearly outlines how ABSA can be further developed. Ever since, more efforts have been made to build an aspect-based analysis system.\nBaccianella [22] introduced SentiWordNet, a lexical re-source that assigns sentiment scores to words based on their synsets. SentiWordNet has been widely used as a feature in tra-ditional machine learning models for aspect-based sentiment"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "A. Dataset Description:\nThe dataset is generated from various YouTube channels where comments were made by individuals about Hausa movies. Within this dataset, comments were categorized as either purely Hausa or Engausa\u00b9.The dataset comprises 590 comments, with four features consisting of comments, aspect words (1-person [actor, actress, director], 2-episode, 3-Movie, 4-general), sentiment polarity (negative or positive), and lan-guage (Hausa, Engausa).\nB. Dataset collection and Preprocessing\nDataset collection was carried out using web scraping with Python, which facilitated the gathering of numerous Hausa comments from YouTube channels. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes preprocessing, involving the removal of instances that did not capture any of the aspect categories and the removal of stopwords words that typically contribute less meaning to a text, such as 'a,' 'ni,' 'to,' 'su,'an'. Additionally, irrelevant terms, such as emojis, usernames, special characters (@, #), punctuation marks, and numbers, were also removed. Furthermore, the texts were converted to lowercase. Finally, comments and aspect words were vectorized using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), one of the most straightforward and effective ways to comprehend the context of a document and locate relevant information and key terms and phrases.\nC. Aspect Term Extraction Processing\nFrom the dataset, the aspect terms were manually annotated by native speakers, looking at both the context and semantic meaning of the review. Some predefined rules were followed for aspect-term annotation. For example, all proper nouns represent either a person or a movie aspect category. We then applied a supervised learning method for aspect-term extraction, specifically, a deep convolutional neural network was used with an attention layer. To enable implicit aspect extraction and understanding, We split the datasets for each task into a training set with 70% of the comments and a test set with the remaining comments. A hyperparameter tuning strategy was utilized to find the best parameter sets.\nD. Model building\nThis section presents the proposed model used in this paper. The model is a deep convolutional neural network with recurrent and attention layers. The recurrent layers allow the model to scan from left to right to identify the semantics of the sentence, while the attention layer allows the model to focus on specific important words in the sentence before the aspect term is extracted."}, {"title": "E. Performance metrics:", "content": "To assess the performance or effectiveness of a model, system, or process, we employ performance metrics, which are quantitative measures.\n\u2022 Accuracy: The number of successfully categorized in-stances (aspect-based sentiment) divided by the total number of cases (aspect-based sentiment instances). It can be calculated using the following formula:\nAccuracy = \\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{Total Instances}\n\u2022 Precision: is calculated as the proportion of true positive instances (positive sentiment polarity) correctly classified as positive. The formula for precision is as follows:\nPrecision = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Positives}\n\u2022 Recall: also known as sensitivity, is the proportion of positive instances correctly classified as positive. The formula for recall is given by:\nRecall = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}\n\u2022 F1 Score: The F1 score is a metric that combines both precision and recall, striking a balance between them. It can be computed using the following formula:\nF1 Score = \\frac{2 \\cdot Precision \\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}"}, {"title": "IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION", "content": "A. Preliminary analysis\nA descriptive analysis conducted on the dataset revealed that the person aspect term appeared the most, while in terms of sentiment polarity, neutral and positive are the majority classes with a few negative instances. The plots indicate that the aspect-based sentiment from the comments we generated shows that viewers are more interested in the person aspect words, which can be either \"director\", \"actor\", or \"actress\".\nB. Performance of the proposed model\nThe performance of the proposed deep learning-based aspect-level sentiment analysis is presented in Fig. 4 and 5 The model was trained on two separate tasks: identifying aspect words and polarity classification of the aspect words. The model was also evaluated on both aspect word extraction and aspect word polarity classification.\nIn Fig. 3, the performance of the proposed deep learning model is evaluated with accuracy and loss curves. the results indicate superior performance over the baseline machine learn-ing model in identifying aspect words from a given review. The model performance on aspect word polarity classification is presented in Fig. 4."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "In this research work, we presented a deep learning-based aspect-level sentiment classification of movie reviews in the Hausa language. The main contributions of this work center on providing a Hausa movie review dataset for aspect-level sentiment analysis. We also proposed a CNN model that learns aspect embeddings in Hausa textual data, a language categorized as underrepresented in natural language processing regarding resources. This provides a starting point for aspect-based sentiment analysis in the Hausa language. The proposed model achieves remarkable performance on both aspect-term extraction and polarity classification, despite the small size of the dataset. The attention layer allows the model to concentrate on a different part of the sentence to discover aspect terms, allowing it to accurately perform aspect-polarity classification. The proposed model outperforms all the compared baseline models which used traditional machine learning models with significant differences.\nThe major challenge of this work is the inability of the model to analyze more than one aspect word in a sentence at a time. Therefore, an intriguing and potential avenue for future work would be to investigate the potential of transformer architecture in aspect-based sentiment analysis to handle the aforementioned challenge of extracting and analyzing all as-pect terms in a sentence simultaneously."}]}

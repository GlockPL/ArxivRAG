Despite the existence of virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality for several years, integrating these technical fields remains a formidable challenge due to their disparate application directions. The advent of AI agents, capable of autonomous perception and action, further compounds this issue by exposing the limitations of traditional human-centered research approaches. It is imperative to establish a comprehensive framework that accommodates the dual perceptual centers of humans and AI agents in both physical and virtual worlds. In this paper, we introduce the symmetrical reality framework, which offers a unified representation encompassing various forms of physical-virtual amalgamations. This framework enables researchers to better comprehend how AI agents can collaborate with humans and how distinct technical pathways of physical-virtual integration can be consolidated from a broader perspective. We then delve into the coexistence of humans and AI, demonstrating a prototype system that exemplifies the operation of symmetrical reality systems for specific tasks, such as pouring water. Subsequently, we propose an instance of an AI-driven active assistance service that illustrates the potential applications of symmetrical reality.

The intelligence of AI agents [101, 132] is rapidly advancing with the emergence of new technologies. For example, large language models such as ChatGPT [150] have completed tasks designed to assess the \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d (ToM) [69] to a large extent. Notably, the recently developed GPT-4 [99] has even passed bar exams intended for humans [65], regardless of whether it possesses the necessary knowledge and reasoning ability. These sophisticated AI models hold the potential to revolutionize human-AI interactions in both physical and virtual environments.\nThe ability of artificial intelligence to generate intelligent agents, which makes the agent exhibit perceptual capabilities comparable to humans [139] or smart behaviors based on perceptual computing [116], draws people's attention to the perceptual processes of these AI agents. This form of perception, which operates in a direction inverse to human perception, can give rise to symmetrical reality (SR) [141] within the context of physical-virtual world integration. From this perspective, virtual reality (VR) [145, 146], mixed reality (MR) [23], and augmented reality (AR) [5, 129] represent specific amalgamations of physical and virtual worlds that consider only one perceptual center"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "We have structured the related work according to the logical framework of symmetrical reality.

In this section, we provide a brief overview of five of these seven components, excluding the two components (i.e., physical environments and physical humans) that are already well-known."}, {"title": "Virtual Environments", "content": "Various devices facilitate the creation of distinct categories of virtual environments [11, 13]. Regardless of the specific device employed, virtual environments constitute a crucial component of the SR framework by providing task environments for AI agents. Physical and virtual elements can be integrated to construct mixed environments [44] for general tasks, with such virtual environments often serving educational or training purposes [64, 26, 148]. Additionally, these environments can supply knowledge and interactive scenarios for AI tasks, such as indoor navigation [147] and teleoperation [82].\nIn addition to the aforementioned customized environments, cooperative working environments [125, 124, 49, 45, 33, 15, 12] have gained widespread popularity. When constructing virtual environments, certain typical devices are utilized. For instance, Ishii et al. introduced a shared drawing medium [59] and proposed \"Tangible Bits\u201d [60] to enhance interfaces. To display virtual information to users, video see-through head-mounted displays [31, 8] and optical see-through head-mounted displays [127] are commonly employed due to their functional properties. While working in virtual environments [38] offers several advantages, balancing privacy and awareness remains a challenge [56]."}, {"title": "AI Agents", "content": "AI agents are integral components of the SR framework, with their rapidly evolving perceptual and cognitive abilities exerting a significant influence on the trajectory of AI research. To comprehend current trends, we will briefly introduce two important concepts, i.e., cognitive AI and explainable AI.\nCognitive AI [113, 40] supports humans in numerous capacities. To develop an AI agent into a cognitive AI, extensive research has been conducted in the field of embodied AI [29]. These tasks are typically accomplished through the construction of various virtual simulators [68, 136, 103, 41, 135, 115, 134, 114]. However, some challenges [21] arise in the collaboration between humans and cognitive AI, as these agents may be driven by internal motivations [6] that are not readily apparent to humans. Consequently, many aspects of life and production, including service robots [62], remote training [72], interactive exhibitions [25], digital assistants[86], companion robots [50], and virtual communities [24], have been transformed by the advancement of cognitive AI.\nExplainable AI (XAI) [27] is a burgeoning field of research within the AI community, aimed at enhancing human trust in intelligent machines. Numerous studies have focused on elucidating AI models, encompassing both local explanations [32, 117, 7, 108, 87] and global explanations [66, 73, 57, 1]. These efforts have facilitated the development of more transparent and trustworthy AI models, thereby fostering greater human trust through more comprehensible machine behavior [105]."}, {"title": "Physical-Virtual Interaction", "content": "Virtual environments facilitate interaction between physical and virtual spaces, enabling humans to access them through specific devices. For instance, a physical-virtual interaction device introduced by Brooks et al. [19] allowed humans to interact with virtual objects via haptics, while a directional perception approach developed by Berm\u00fadez et al. [14] enabled interaction with magnetic fields.\nInteractive virtual environments enhance learning from demonstration [4] by providing rich interac-tions between physical and virtual worlds. In the context of symmetrical reality, interaction between physical and virtual worlds is bidirectional, although few prior studies have achieved this objective. Commercial handles [81], custom glove-based systems [83], and hybrid tracking systems [75] can track hand poses to transmit hand information to virtual environments, representing the forward interaction of SR. Once interaction information is mapped to the virtual environment, imitation learning [138] becomes feasible based on observed human behavior [9]. However, the application of learned knowledge to the physical environment and the corresponding modification of physical objects remain unresolved challenges, despite the relative ease of achieving bidirectional information display [36, 37, 96]."}, {"title": "Human-AI Interaction", "content": "A primary objective of AI development is to serve and enhance human life, rendering the study of human-AI interaction a critical issue for Al researchers and developers. Amershi et al. [2] proposed 18 design guidelines for human-AI interaction across diverse scenarios, providing valuable guidance for developers in designing effective interaction systems for human-AI tasks. Because AI machines are not natural entities within the physical world, they must convey information through human-comprehensible visualizations [84], establishing an information bridge between humans and machines via shared workspaces [104]. Moreover, for complex tasks, mind modeling [42] and capability calibration [43] may be necessary to facilitate mutual understanding between humans and machines. Notice that the AI encompassed within the context of human-AI interaction includes both human-like AI (i.e., physical humanoid robots and virtual humans) and general-form AI (i.e., smart wearable devices, digital assistants, and virtual agents in the virtual world).

However, there are fundamental differences between the two concepts. Digital Twin is a framework that maps the physical world to the virtual world throughout its lifespan, enabling digital information to assist humans in managing their physical environments. This has led to its widespread use in industrial areas [126]. The first difference between Digital Twin and symmetrical reality concerns existing objects. In symmetrical reality, virtual objects may exist without being mapped from the physical world and vice versa, whereas Digital Twin typically requires a complete mapping structure between the physical and virtual worlds. The second difference is the dual-center perceptual structure. In symmetrical reality, physical humans and AI agents have equal status regarding their cognitive activities [119], while Digital Twin does not address cognitive issues. The third difference concerns the system operation mechanism. In symmetrical reality, it is assumed that AI agents may possess a mind (and sometimes even free will [79]), allowing them to perceive, cognize, make decisions, and act independently without human intervention.

The general long-term setting typically involves several hours of continuous VR/AR device use [51], necessitating the provision of basic needs to ensure normal living for humans and normal functioning for AI agents.\nDuring long-term coexistence, humans have many basic needs, such as eating, drinking, and sleeping. To analyze these needs, Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory [90] is applied.

Even when immersed in a symmetrical reality system, humans still have physiological needs. A person must eat and drink, even in a virtual or physical-virtual mixed environment. The symmetrical reality system (e.g., a head-mounted display-based system) should support basic human needs such as food and drink.\nSafety Needs. The prospect of human-AI long-term coexistence may give rise to safety considerations. Symmetrical reality, by mapping segments of the virtual world onto corresponding areas of the physical world, facilitates rapid human adaptation to the virtual environment. This helps address concerns related to physical safety and psychological health.\nLove and Belonging. Emotional needs are essential for humans, and long-term coexistence requires providing an emotional experience for users. The independent AI agent in a symmetrical reality system can serve as a friend and companion to the human user. Family is important to humans, providing love and support. Being situated in a virtual environment without other people might be emotionally harmful. This is where symmetrical reality can be useful. AI agents with minds can be embodied as virtual humans, serving as friends or family to users in the virtual world.\nEsteem. Humans require esteem, even when living in a virtual environment. Esteem involves receiving respect from others and having the freedom to engage in regular activities. In daily life, humans seek esteem from others to facilitate cooperation. This social need can be met by AI agents that adopt human appearances and behavior patterns.\nSelf-Actualization.

No other symmetry is essential, and asymmetries can exist in many aspects. For example, not every physical object must have a corresponding virtual object, and events may occur exclusively in the virtual world without any relation to the physical world. These asymmetries within symmetrical reality increase the functional diversity of the physical and virtual worlds. If the essential symmetry is broken, such as by the absence of an AI agent, the symmetrical reality system will degenerate into one of its special forms. If the virtual world is entirely new and unrelated to the physical world, it represents a maximization of asymmetry within symmetrical reality, which is an extreme case.\nCognitive AI is a typical presence in a symmetrical reality system, corresponding to a certain level of human-like AI. As a complement, non-cognitive AI should also be compatible with these situations, corresponding to general-form AI. Non-cognitive AI may behave differently from humans and may not have any meaningful embodiment, but it can perform specific tasks well. For example, a recommendation system can make many decisions to enhance human experiences in various applications without requiring human-like behavior or embodiment. Symmetrical reality systems should be able to leverage this dedicated AI to improve their service capabilities.\nHuman-level AI is a goal of the AI community, and the proposed symmetrical reality framework also anticipates such an AI agent for cooperation with humans.

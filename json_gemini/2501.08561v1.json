INTRODUCTION", "content": "The increasing demand of human-centric automation highlights the need for seamless collaboration between humans and intelligent systems for better productivity [1]. Moreover, we have noticed a significant change in modern technology, where the emphasis is now on systems that are not only efficient but also adaptable and safe, especially in changing environments. Digital Twins (DTs), which are real-time digital replicas of physical systems, play an important role in bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. They help improve monitoring, decision-making, and optimization in complex scenarios such as smart factories, autonomous systems, and various adaptable environments. However, traditional Digital Twins (DTs) often struggle to adapt and respond to human inputs in real-time. While Dynamic Digital Twins (DDTs) and Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) attempt to address these challenges through the integration of real-time data [2], they still struggle to seamlessly incorporate human input and ensure the interpretability of complex decision processes. This limitation ultimately hinders adaptive systems from reaching their full potential.\nTo address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning Framework for digital twin technology called ANSR-DT. This framework uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in collaboration with the CNN-LSTM and attention technique to ensure logical clarity of symbolic reasoning [3], aiming to create an adaptive system that maintains interpretability while addressing user needs. This approach is particularly well-suited for applications requiring human interaction, as it facilitates transparent decision-making processes, which is required for both empirical data analysis and domain-specific rules.\nThe key contributions of ANSR-DT include:\nWe propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture for digital twin technology that integrates deep learning and symbolic reasoning to improve decision-making processes in operational environments.\nThe PPO algorithm in collaboration with the CNN-LSTM, within the proposed ANSR-DT framework, enables continuous learning that ensures real-time adaptation to user preferences and environmental changes.\nThe statistical results from the considered scenarios demonstrate strong performance in terms of comparative metrics in the presence of rival frameworks. In addition, symbolic reasoning used in this work is a step forward in developing real-world algorithms that yield logically reasoned results for better operation and performance.\nAn open-source implementation that facilitates reproducibility and invites future research in adaptive digital twins.\nANSR-DT distinguishes itself by initially focusing on optimizing neural components for robust pattern recognition and decision-making, while concurrently developing symbolic reasoning capabilities to enhance interpretability and adaptability. This dual focus ensures that the system performs effectively in identifying critical patterns and provides meaningful insights and recommendations based on symbolic logic, thereby fostering more effective human-machine collaboration in complex industrial environments [4]."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "In recent times, we have noted a significant shift in technology, where digital twins and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled industrial systems to adapt to real-time situations, thereby improving productivity [5], [6]. For instance, Walmsley et al. [5] proposed an Adaptive Digital Twin (ADT) framework for energy-intensive industrial applications to improve the decision-making processes. They used advanced computing techniques along with machine-learning algorithms to enhance self-optimization and improve the productivity of these applications, while Ogunsakin et al. [6] proposed a feature selection-based technique considering architectural framework. This technique aims to improve real-time simulation and online optimization by ensuring synchronization between physical systems and their digital counterparts in dynamic manufacturing environments.\nNeuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged as a promising approach to bridge the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It combines these algorithms with the interpretability of symbolic reasoning, making AI systems easier to understand [3]. In [7], Schmidt et al. explored the potential of NeSy AIs in industrial settings, while Schmidt et al. [7] reviewed NeSy techniques for knowledge graph construction in manufacturing. Zhou et al. [8] highlighted the applications of this technology in Bosch's industrial environments. Munir et al. [9] proposed a zero-touch explainable AI framework for IoT environments using Bayesian networks and neural reasoning to enhance decision transparency. However, these frameworks primarily focus on static decision models and do not address the dynamic updating of symbolic rules in response to rapidly evolving environments, limiting their adaptability in industrial applications.\nTherefore, it is important to ensure consistency between digital and physical models for reliability in digital twin technologies, where human-robot collaboration is required [10]. Ma et al. [10] proposed an intelligent method for managing the structure and parameters of physical systems and their digital representations. Nevertheless, their approach lacks continuous learning mechanisms and adaptive rule updates, reducing its effectiveness in swiftly changing industrial environments where human-robot interactions are dynamic.\nIn [8], the authors highlighted the limitations in the existing literature on neuro-symbolic AI, especially in relation to ADTs. Following this discussion, Ogunsakin et al. [6] emphasized that the current literature fails to address these limitations due to its focus on static approaches, which do not consider the dynamic nature of these applications. Therefore, we proposed ANSR-DT in this work to manage these challenges and make this technology more fruitful in the future."}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "content": "In this section, we will discuss the proposed ANSR-DT framework by focusing on its architectural structure and operational scenarios. To provide a visual overview, we have included Fig. 1 in the paper. The ANSR-DT framework uses a three-layer architecture such as physcial layer, processing layer, and adaptation layer to facilitate seamless integration of physical and digital objects in the system. In addition, we have added Fig. 2 to illustrate the operational steps in a real scenario by demonstrating how sensor data flows through the system and how the system learns and reasons when making decisions.\nIn the physical layer, different sensors such as temperature, vibration, and pressure sensors, collect and process data about the system's thermal variations, mechanical oscillations, and fluid dynamics, respectively. The processing layer then utilizes the CNN-LSTM algorithms to translate neural outputs into interpretable results. Finally, the adaptation layer ensures that the system can adjust to dynamic changes in order to address changing conditions effectively. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [11], is used in the framework for this task to ensure real-time learning with precise decisions, ultimately leading to improved productivity. This process is generalized as below:\n$\\L^{PPO} (\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_t \\left[ \\min \\left( r_t(\\theta) A_t, \\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon) A_t \\right) - \\beta H[\\pi_\\theta] \\right]$ (1)\nIn Equation 1, $r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(a_t, s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t, s_t)}$ represents the probability ratio of choosing a new action $a_t$ in the current state $s_t$ under a new policy compared to an old policy. This ratio helps in updating the policy towards more rewarding actions in the given environment. Meanwhile, $A_t = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$ calculates the Advantage function, which measures how much better an action is compared to the average action at a given state, guiding the model in estimating the value of taking a specific action under the current policy. For better exploration of the environment, we have set the Entropy coefficient, $\\beta$, at 0.01. This coefficient helps encourage exploration by adding randomness to the action selection, which prevents the model from settling too quickly on a potentially suboptimal policy. In addition, we use a clipping parameter epsilon ($\\epsilon = 0.2$) to limit the extent of policy updates to maintain stable learning progress by avoiding drastic policy changes during training.\nTo improve the performance of the PPO algorithm, we made the undermentioned changes during the fine-tuning process. We set the batch size to 64 samples to stabilize gradient estimation and facilitate a smoother learning process. The learning rate is settled at $10^{-3}$ to ensure efficient adjustments during training, while the policy was updated at 10 epochs to ensure an ample amount of time for the learning process. The discount factor ($\\gamma = 0.99$) is employed to appropriately value future rewards, balancing the immediate and long-term benefits of actions. Lastly, we utilize Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) with $\\lambda = 0.95$, providing a more accurate and stable estimation of the Advantage function. This significantly helps in the convergence of the settled policy toward optimal behaviors.\nThe understated expression illustrates how the proposed framework adapts to complex patterns during the learning process to make more efficient decisions.\n$R_{new} = \\{r | conf(r) > \\tau, r \\in F(M_\\theta, D)\\}$ (2)"}, {"title": "A.

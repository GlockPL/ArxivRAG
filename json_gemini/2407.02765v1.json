We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $L^\\infty$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In a distributed optimization problem over a network, all nodes cooperatively optimize a global cost function which is the sum of local cost functions, and each node only knows its own local cost function. Distributed optimization involving information exchange among nodes over a large-scale network can be found applications in distributed machine learning ([1]), multi-agent target tracking ([2]), distributed resource allocation ([3]), and so on. The dimensions of these algorithms explode as the number of nodes increases, and it is of interest to investigate the limiting case as the number of nodes tends to infinity. In fact, games and optimal control problems with a continuum of individuals have been studied intensively in the field called mean field games, which was pioneered independently by Huang, Caines and Malham\u00e9 ([4]) and Lasry and Lions ([5]), respectively. They attempt to understand the behaviors of the limiting systems of the dynamic games with a large number of individuals. In the past decades, there has been an increasing intention in mean field games and their applications ([6]-[13]). Motivated by the distributed optimization over large-scale networks and the developing theory of mean-field control and games, we investigate the limiting model of the distributed optimization problem as the number of nodes tends to infinity, that is, the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes.\nLet [0, 1] be the set of a continuum of nodes, each element of which corresponds to a node. The connecting structure among nodes is given by the graphon A, which is a symmetric measurable function from [0,1] \u00d7 [0, 1] to [0,1] ([14]). Any node $p\\in$ [0,1] has a private local cost function $V(p,x) : [0,1] \u00d7 R^n \\rightarrow R$, which is strongly convex and continuously differentiable w.r.t. $x \\in$ $IR^n$ and is integrable w.r.t. $p \\in$ [0,1]. The objective of all nodes is to cooperatively solve the optimization problem\n$\\min_{x\\in R^n}V(x) \\triangleq \\int_{[0,1]} V(p,x)dp,$\n(1)\nfor which there is a unique minimizer of $V(x)$ denoted by $x^*$.\nIn the distributed optimization over the network with finite nodes, all nodes interact through the underlying network. The interactions among nodes depend on their labels and so are het- erogeneous. In the graphon mean field theory, the concept of graph limit is introduced into the"}, {"title": "II.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS", "content": "We have proposed the stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon for solving the distributed optimization problem with a continuum of nodes. By estab- lishing the lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, we have proved the uniform boundness of the second moments of the nodes' states in both kinds of algorithms. Besides, we have proved that if the graphon is connected and the time-varying algorithm gains are chosen properly, then the states in both kinds of algorithms achieve L\u221e-consensus. Moreover, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then the states in both kinds of algorithms converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.\nNote that the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the graphon particle systems relies on the special linear interactions among nodes in the proposed two kinds of algorithms, while for many graphon particle systems, such as Kuramoto oscillator ([26]), neural mean-field ([27]), SIS epidemics ([28]) and so on, the interactions are nonlinear. This results in that the methods in this paper are inapplicable. Besides, the graphon considered in this paper is static. In many practical scenarios, networks among nodes receive the feedback from nearby individuals and then make changes to better adapt to the world, such as adaptive Kuramoto-type network models in [29], which leads to a dynamic graphon. The asymptotic properties of the graphon particle systems with dynamic graphons are still open so far, which is of major importance from an applied perspective but highly mathematically challenging."}]}

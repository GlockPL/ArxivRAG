Rooted in Seymour Papert's constructionist philosophy, this study examines how constructionist principles align with the expanding role of digital technology in personal and collective learning. We discuss the transformation of educational environments from hierarchical instructionism to constructionist models that emphasize learner autonomy and interactive, creative engagement. Central to this analysis is the concept of an \u201cexpanded personality\", wherein digital tools and AI integration fundamentally reshape individual self-perception and social interactions. By integrating constructionism into the paradigm of smart education, we propose it as a foundational approach to personalized and democratized learning.

Introduction", "content": "More than half a century ago, at the dawn of the digital age, Seymour Papert pioneered constructionism. Constructionism is a learning theory that emphasizes the construction of knowledge through active creation and experimentation, proposing that learners develop their understanding most effectively when they build personally meaningful artifacts. In Papert's own words: \u201cConstructionism. . . shares constructivism's connotation of learning as 'building knowledge structures' irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a public entity...\" (Harel & Papert, 1991). This innovative educational approach came into life within the context of the emergence of digital technology, as Papert considered computers as a new medium that children could use for making things and expressing themselves (Resnick, 2020). Our paper posits that the ongoing transformation of education in an AI-driven world is inextricably linked to the principles of constructionism. By examining historical foundations and technological advancements, we establish that constructionism offers a valuable framework for effectively integrating AI technologies into educational practices.

The Information History of Humanity and Its Transformations", "content": "Information, perception, storage and preservation, and transmission are inherent to living organisms, starting with the most primitive ones. At the same time, it is clear that the main stages in the development of humankind are to a very large extent connected with how a person works with information. In this aspect, information revolutions associated with the emergence of the following three concepts can be distinguished (Semenov & Ziskin, 2023):\n\u2022 Consciousness;\n\u2022 Speech;\n\u2022 Writing.\nThese revolutions occurred at increasing (one can metaphorically say exponentially increasing) speeds. A hundred years ago, in mathematics and then in technology, a new revolution began\u2014the revolution of artificial intelligence, and the transfer of human intellectual functions to machines.\nOn a more detailed scale, we can also mention, for example, the Gutenberg revolution\u2014a leap in the means of distributing textual and visual information. We can also talk about the revolutions of photo-cinema, radio, television, and sound recording, which made it possible to transfer the means of perception, storage, and transmission of visual and sound information outside of human beings.\nConsidering the processes within the revolution of artificial intelligence under such a \"historical microscope\", we can talk about the revolution of rational AI, when rational functions of human consciousness were transferred to the machine, such as the ability to perform algebraic calculations; the next one can be described as the transfer of intuitive consciousness to the machine, i.e., the revolution of machine learning; and the (so far) last one, which is intensively progressing today, can be termed the transfer of creative consciousness.\nWe can also highlight the moment when a revolution reached everyone, similar to the revolution of radio and television broadcasting and the Gutenberg revolution.\nIn The Onlife Manifesto, the period preceding the late 1970s is characterized as the \"information prehistory\u201d of humanity. This era marked the time before the advent of the personal computer (PC), which fundamentally transformed information access and management. With the PC, people gained a tangible, unprecedented ability to independently save, copy, process, transmit, and share information in various forms. Consequently, the birth of the PC represents the starting point of humanity's \u201cinformation history\". In just three decades, a substantial portion of the global population became able to engage with information that was not only freely accessible but also integral to everyday existence.\nThe mid-2010s are identified as the onset of humanity's \u201cinformation post-history\". This period reflects a shift where individuals began to inhabit an interconnected, digital environment, extending beyond the confines of their physical selves and beginning to perceive themselves as informational entities who are integrated within an expansive informational space.\nWith the release of ChatGPT 3.5 in late 2022 (or an alternative date of your choosing), the notion of \"post-history\u201d underwent a profound transformation, as artificial intelligence entered the forefront of the digital revolution.\nThe \"pre-historical\u201d 1970s represent a time when technology was not yet seen as deeply intertwined with human life.

The Digital Revolution as a Transformation of the Human Worldview", "content": "More than a hundred years ago, Sigmund Freud described three, in his view, key revolutions in people's worldviews (Freud, 1955).\nThe first revolution, according to Freud, is the revolution of Copernicus, which abolished humanity's ideas regarding the location of the Earth of Man in the center of the Universe, placing the Earth in the series of planets of the solar system (which continued in subsequent cosmogony and cosmography). The second is Darwin's revolution, which abolished Man's opposition to all other living things, placing humans in the general evolutionary flow (which continued in genetics, etc.). The third is the revolution of Freud, which abolished the idea of the human mind as controlling the behavior of Man (and continued in the ideas of the collective unconscious and mass consciousness).\nAccording to this logic, we live in the era of the next revolution in the history of humankind, when humans cease to view themselves as separate subjects and inhabitants of the physical, natural world, and become inhabitants of the information cyberspace (a hyperconnected information organism). Moreover, in this revolution, the idea of the biological brain of humans as the only substrate of intellectual activity has been abolished. This intellectual activity is today shared by humankind with artificial intelligence, supporting the activity of each of us and communication between us. We can call this the Turing revolution, which shows that humans are not the only carriers of rational thinking. This revolution"}, {"title": "4. Changing Self-Perception: Personalization and the Expansion of the Personality", "content": "In this section, we explore the transformation of individuals, their roles in the world, and their understanding of new opportunities in the digital age. These questions constitute the first and most essential components of a worldview that we explore in our work.\nIt is understandable that the PC, as a personal tool, would become the foundation of a new media reality. The PC's role in changing the traditional media environment that was established during the printing revolution is difficult to overestimate. Individuals gained the opportunity to transfer their information and communication activities to electronic media, opening up previously inaccessible ways of creating, storing, transmitting, and processing information of various forms and types. This alone represented a significant expansion of personal capabilities.\nThis expansion of human capabilities was instrumental. It was centered on replacing traditional \"printed\" methods of information activity with new, electronic ones.\nAt the dawn of electronic media, Marshall McLuhan, a pioneering figure in media studies and an influential Canadian philosopher, proclaimed in his 1964 book Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (McLuhan, 1964) that \"The medium is the message\". He suggested a radical departure from traditional views of media as passive tools. Media, according to McLuhan, rather than merely enhancing human abilities or optimizing existing processes, actively shape and transform human perception and experience, creating entirely new capabilities and ways of interacting with the world\u2014capabilities that had no equivalents in previous media eras.\nThis aspect of non-instrumentality is particularly evident in the digital media of today, which fundamentally redefines the scale and nature of personal and social expansion in the digital era. Digital technologies, beginning with computers and the networked environments that they enable, introduced phenomena that transcend simple communication or information processing. From immersive digital environments to AI-driven interactions, these technologies enable modes of expression, self-perception, and connection that are unique to the digital age, fundamentally altering how individuals relate to both information and each other (Gallese, 2024). We argue that this non-instrumentality is the defining feature of digital media, shaping its revolutionary impact on the modern human experience.\nFrom our perspective, the first non-instrumental phenomenon of the digital era is the emergence of computational thinking as the most important component of cognitive activity for people in general, and schoolchildren in particular. The non-instrumental aspect of computational thinking has no analogs in previous media eras, unlike, for example, a computer keyboard, a text and graphic editor, or even email. Never before has an individual been given the opportunity to formulate the rules for an artifact's functioning without limits, thereby enabling it to operate independently. Moreover, this can be achieved in an understandable language\u2014a programming language. Recognizing the uniqueness and unique role of computational thinking for schoolchildren became the focus of Papert's attention in the mid-1970s and took a central place in his theory of constructionism. Today, in the digital era, computational thinking manifests itself even more vividly. It is not without reason that the leading contemporary researcher of digital media, Lev Manovich (2013), refined McLuhan's famous definition to say that \u201cThe software is the message\u201d.\nIt is important to emphasize that when discussing the role of computational thinking in expanding the personality, we interpret the activity of creating software much more broadly than mere programming. It represents a new type of cognitive activity, forming a new human perception of the surrounding world (Papert, 2000). Computational thinking introduces an algorithmic component to our traditional perception of the world, fostering the idea that the phenomena around us are based not only on the laws of nature, but"}, {"title": "5. Papert's Constructionism", "content": "The authors of this paper had the distinct privilege of actively engaging with the pioneering work of Seymour Papert and his colleagues since the late 1980s, integrating his innovative ideas directly into their educational practice and conceptual designs, often under Papert's direct involvement (Semenov, 2017/in press). As is usually the case with visionary figures whose contributions reshape human understanding, S. Papert's ideas were frequently articulated through aphorisms and paradoxes, and his statements could sometimes appear self-contradictory. This tendency toward philosophical fluidity and bold, occasionally contradictory stances reflects Papert's intellectual depth and openness to evolution, allowing his views to adapt and expand over time.\nOne intriguing example of Papert's complex perspective, which invites agreement only within specific contexts, is his critical stance toward the Internet. Although this position might seem counterintuitive today, it underscores his commitment to fostering active, hands-on learning experiences and his concern that passive information consumption might undermine his championed constructionist principles. As his ideas develop, Papert's occasional skepticism of emerging technologies highlights his nuanced and layered approach to considering the potential impacts of digital tools on education and human development. This openness to reassessing his own views is emblematic of the depth and adaptability that defined Papert's legacy as a thinker and educator.\nIn this section, we articulate our interpretation of constructionism, grounding it in our concept of the \"expanded personality\u201d, a notion of the individual that encompasses a symbiotic relationship with external tools and technologies. This expanded personality reflects a human being who extends their cognitive, communicative, and operational capacities through various instrumental aids, from traditional tools such as the clock and pen and paper to the vast resources offered by an encyclopedia or a mobile phone that is connected to the Internet. These tools serve as conveniences and integral components of a person's cognitive framework, fundamentally enhancing the scope and flexibility of thought, memory, and interaction. This perspective situates constructionism within a broader understanding of learning and knowledge building, where the integration of external resources becomes essential to constructing knowledge and expressing personal agency.\nConstructionism is an educational philosophy that emphasizes independent creation, building, invention, and discovery of new concepts by students through interaction with others, engaging in collaborative activities, motivation, and scaffolding provided by them. Parallels can be drawn here with social constructivism and co-constructivism, as described by W. Fthenakis (2015a, 2015b).\nBuilding on the insights of John Amos Comenius (1680), Papert underscored the central importance of mathetics\u2014the art, science, and technology of learning-placing it above traditional didactics in guiding students. At the heart of education, he argued, lies the fundamental constructionist goal: cultivating the ability to autonomously build knowledge in its broadest sense. This encompasses not only acquiring knowledge, but also developing skills, competencies, and attitudes that contribute to a well-rounded, adaptable learner.\nCentral to this constructionist skillset is the capacity to construct and refine one's understanding within the framework of an \u201cexpanded personality\u201d, in which cognitive tools and external resources are integrated into personal knowledge building. Such a learner is empowered not only to apply their understanding practically, but also to connect"}, {"title": "6. Constructionism in Smart Education", "content": "Within the broader smart education framework (Zhu et al., 2016; Pozo, 2017), which encompasses all aspects of technology-enhanced education, smart learning represents learner-centered, knowledge-constructing mathetics (Konstantinov & Semenov, 2022). Other components complementing smart learning include smart environments, which deal with designing both physical and virtual spaces that support learning; smart teaching, which focuses on methods for facilitating learning experiences; and smart assessment, which evaluates learning outcomes in these environments.\nThe paradigm of smart education represents a significant evolution in our understanding of technology's role in the learning process. It embodies a fundamental reconsideration of how technology and learning intertwine, moving beyond the instrumental use of technology to a deeply integrative approach, where technology becomes an organic part of the educational ecosystem. Within this framework, we propose a novel conceptualization: positioning constructionism, a theory developed by Seymour Papert, as the embodiment of smart learning\u2014a core component of smart education.\nThis positioning, encapsulated in the equation \u201cConstructionism = Philosophy of Smart Learning\", carries several important implications for educational practice and theory. It underscores the importance of active, hands-on learning experiences, where technology serves as a medium for exploration and creation rather than merely a tool for routine operations. Constructionist smart learning prioritizes learner autonomy, emphasizing self-directed learning and knowledge construction through experience and creation rather\""}, {"title": "6.1. The Personalization of Education in the Networking Age", "content": "During the early era of personal computing, the impact on human cognition was less apparent. At that time, discussions about computational thinking-the defining characteristic of the period\u2014remained largely confined to academic and educational circles. In the network era, the expansion of personality becomes a subject of discussion for the general public, and most importantly, is intensified due to the intensive development of Internet technologies and the formation of a network society based on these in \u201cThe Information Age\" trilogy (Castells, 1996a, 1997, 1998).\nThe hyperconnectivity of its inhabitants characterizes the network society. Everything and everyone are connected to each other: people with people, people with machines, and machines with machines. In these conditions, the microworlds of people turn out to be atoms of the hyperconnected world. This circumstance creates a new dimension in the self-perception of the extended personality. In the network, an individual's extended personality is formed and developed not only by creating its own microworld, but also in intensive interaction with other personalities and their microworlds. A person finds themself in a world of numerous interactions, where their personality is identified and functions. This new type of personality formation occurs in the context of a new phenomenon of personal online identification (personal identity online) (Floridi, 2011; Rodogno, 2011). This latest extension of the personality, associated with hyperconnectivity, provided every inhabitant of our planet with the possibility of unlimited access to other inhabitants (e.g., via social"}, {"title": "6.2. The Personalization of Education in the Age of Generative AI", "content": "From a constructionist perspective, personalization has been a critical component of education since the dawn of the digital age (Lukowicz et al., 2012). This role has not only been confirmed, but also strengthened in the networked age. However, with the advent of generative AI, personalization is reaching an entirely new level, emerging as an unprecedented phenomenon. It is not merely the interactivity of generative chatbots that is striking, but the way that they create the impression of intentionality in the interlocutor (the student). Interaction with generative AI is no longer just an exchange of information; chatbots become personal interlocutors that are capable of generating content that is deeply tailored to the student's needs. The knowledge produced reflects the individual's unique way of thinking, as well as responding to and shaping their questions. Over time, the chatbot evolves into a personal interlocutor, functioning as a kind of \"alter ego\" for the student. This interaction takes students beyond traditional methods of analysis and comprehension, immersing them in a personalized, creative process. Furthermore, this innovative personalization extends to the selection and creation of educational content.\nThis means that it is the full-scale implementation of the dialogic learning of Rupert Wegerif (Phillipson & Wegerif, 2017; Wegerif & Major, 2023) and Mikhail Bakhtin's dialogic philosophy (Bakhtin, 1986).\nThe role of generative AI in personalization can be examined through the lens of cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2011), which is especially relevant in the era of AI-enhanced learning. By adapting its output to match the learner's expertise level, AI optimizes the intrinsic cognitive load, ensuring that students' cognitive resources are effectively managed. Offloading tasks, such as information gathering or basic problem structuring to AI, allows learners to focus their working memory on deeper conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking.\nAdditionally, AI reduces extraneous cognitive load by presenting information tailored to individual learner characteristics and prior knowledge, while sustaining germane cognitive load to support schema construction and automation. This aligns with cognitive load theory's focus on managing working memory limitations and element interactivity for more effective learning.\nLooking back, it seems that the constructionist approach to learning was designed in anticipation of the kind of interaction we now observe between the learner and the learning environment. A clear example of this is the concept of the \u201cobject to think with", "object to think with\",\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"7.

In this particular aspect, Papert's approach has become widely known.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"7.1. Democratizing Education at the Beginning of the IT Era\",\n      \"content\": \"Papert notes that the use of computers as a means of teaching is in contradiction with the traditional education system, which is built on a hierarchical principle. In his work \\\"Perestroika and Epistemological Politics\\\" (Papert, 1990, 2016), written under the impression of the events in the USSR and his first visits there, working with Russian teachers and children, he presents evidence that new technologies create a situation in which the education system cannot remain the same. The contradiction that Papert sees in epistemology is the contradiction between two concepts of knowledge: hierarchical, centralized, and distanced from the student, on the one hand, and decentralized and personalized on the other. He characterizes this contradiction as a confrontation between traditional forms of teaching, focused on the teacher, and approaches that consider the student to be at the center of the pedagogical process which is oriented towards their intellectual growth. Papert draws an analogy with the \u201cperestroika": "hat was taking place in the USSR at that time, noting that Gorbachev's attempt to improve the system, to rebuild it, and to adjust it was not successful. The system collapsed, and in his opinion, the same will happen throughout the world with the familiar centralized education system, with its uniform curricula, textbooks, exams, etc. Papert's call for replacing the old, obsolete education system with a new, decentralized one is a call for the democratization of schools.\nThis kind of democratization is constituted by the social and primarily ideological content of the second component of the constructionist worldview."}, {"title": "7.2. Democratizing Education in the Networked Society", "content": "In 1990, ideas of the democratization of education were perceived as utopian dreams that could only be realized in the distant future.\nThe rise of a networked society has given new momentum to democratic ideals, reshaping both social structures and educational paradigms. This transformation was catalyzed by the Internet's emergence and rapid evolution from a simple communication tool into a pervasive digital fabric that fundamentally altered the global human experience.\nWith the development of the Internet and social networks, the next stage, hyperconnectivity, emerged and strengthened the democratization process. The ability of learners to connect and share content globally, beyond traditional educational frameworks, became a defining feature of this phase. The constructionist paradigm in education took on new forms through online communities where students could learn from each other, creating and sharing knowledge without mediation by formal institutions. Hyperconnectivity pushed constructionism toward more democratic approaches, softening hierarchies and opening the access to knowledge and creative opportunities for broader segments of society.\nThe network society is a dynamic society. Communication between people in the network requires a prompt response to any network event. Connectivity is becoming the norm, a natural state of a person. Both students and teachers are now inhabitants of the information cyberspace and not our familiar real world. How to interact, learn, and teach in these new conditions is a difficult question, the answer to which is highly topical.\nThe process of socialization in the digital world has undergone significant changes. The nature of interaction within the network contradicts the usual hierarchical communication model. In a developed digital society, the network takes interactions between people to a higher level. This level of open and accessible communication contradicts not only the hierarchical structure of traditional society, but even more importantly, the principles of civil society that were formed during the Enlightenment. This problem became the focus of researchers several years ago. A research direction called \u201cDigital Enlightenment", "Digital Enlightenment\" had a chance to be much more democratic and open than the authoritarian Enlightenment of 18th-century intellectuals.\nInformation openness is one of the main features of the digital society. It is clearly manifested in the style of network activity itself, in particular, creative activity. Network inhabitants can now be both consumers and producers of content. In other words, they can be readers and writers at the same time. In the society we are used to, people's creative activity was based on a copyright on the content they create. Authors shared only the results of their work with readers. In other words, they shared their successes. In the digital era, authors often share content in the process of its creation, turning it into a collaboration with readers. Such openness does not contradict the formal principles of copyright as much as the concept of creative activity in the era of print culture, i.e., the culture of the book. The transition from traditional forms of creativity to a more open creative space, where people share content at different stages, characterizes the digital society. The tendency to share content leads to transparency in digital culture. Such \u201ccollective creativity\" obviously cannot be reflected in the context of the school within the digital society, which will require serious reflection.\nAt the same time, there is reason to assume that the tendency of openness should balance the tendency of individualization of personality discussed in the previous chapter. The study of the interaction and joint dynamics of individuality and transparency is a subject requiring special attention, since this problem is related to almost all components of education: the curriculum, teaching methods, assessment, etc.\nInformation openness and the phenomena accompanying it found real embodiment both in pedagogical practice and theory.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"7.3. Democratizing Education in the Age of Generative Al\",\n      \"content\": \"The era of generative AI is the most significant stage of democratization within constructionist education. We are witnessing a radical shift in how technologies are perceived\u2014not just as tools for accomplishing tasks, but as equal participants in the educational process (Levin et al.). Generative AI evolved beyond a mere tool to become an intellectual collaborator, transforming the traditional human-machine hierarchy into a partnership of equals. In education, it functions not as a subordinate instrument, but as an active co-creator, engaging with students in meaningful dialogue. This shift marks a new phase in the democratization of knowledge creation and learning.\nGenerative AI is not just a technology; it is a new \u201cinhabitant": "f our planet, a new agent with which students can interact at a level that is comparable to interaction with a person. Al evolved into a sophisticated educational collaborator\u2014embodying Papert's concept of an 'object to think with' (Papert, 1980b)-enabling intellectual partnerships of unprecedented depth. Unlike previous digital technologies, such as computers and the Internet, generative AI changes the very nature of the interaction, which leads to a novel and unprecedented level and nature of democratization.\nThis transformation is closely linked to the ideas of the influential French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, who advocated rethinking the hierarchical structure of human-technology interactions (Simondon, 1958). He emphasized that the traditional view of technology as a subordinate tool no longer reflects reality. He discussed how society evolved to treat animals respectfully, recognize equality between men and women, and promote racial equality. This represents a rejection of old systems of control and a transition to a new form of respectful interaction, with technology as an active participant in human life. His ideas are particularly relevant in the context of generative AI, where technologies become integral parts of the cognitive process, not merely objects of manipulation.\nBruno Latour's works, especially his actor-network theory (Latour, 2005), encourage a rethinking of the role of technology and objects in human society. Latour argued that technologies cannot simply be instruments controlled by humans; they are equal actors within a network of interactions. This idea supports the concept of democratization in education, where technologies such as generative AI play active roles in creating knowledge and facilitating teaching.\nAnother dimension for development may be the digital AI component of the teacher's personality. This component helps each student co-create and dialog with the teacher. They also try to consider the parents' position to form an individual system of goals, as well as tasks that lead to these goals. A system of goals that is possible for different students is included in the smart environment and corresponds to the redundancy principle. However, the concept of \"excess\" is losing its meaning today.\nThe digital component can control in detail all the parameters of the students: attention and fatigue in the classroom during the lesson or the deviation of the student's results from those previously planned by the student themself on the way to achieving an individual goal. Thus, AI participates in the implementation of the principle of subjectivity.\nThis component can draw the attention of the biological part of the teacher to the student's problem, as well as provide a visualization of any degree of detail or enlargement of the situation in the classroom. It can predict the student's results based on their individual history of learning and highlight the most significant elements of this history\u2014the \u201cstarry clock of learning", "evident": "it facilitates communication among students in digital environments, records their interactions through audio and video, and analyzes this communication during collaborative work sessions. Thus, the democratization of education in the twenty-first century reaches a qualitatively new level. Within the framework of constructionism, it manifests in the development of intellectual democracy, where both students and technologies collaboratively create knowledge and content. This collaboration weakens hierarchical relationships and fosters more equitable forms of interaction. Consequently, education ceases to be strictly hierarchical, and technologies become active participants in learning and knowledge formation."}, {"title": "8. Personalization and Democratization in Generative AI Enhanced Classroom", "content": "In the previous sections, we proposed two key directions for integrating GenAI into education: personalization and democratization. In this chapter, we discuss the potential avenues for practically implementing these strategies, as presented in the article, within the school learning process.\nA promising approach to personalization lies in creating a learning environment based on the \"partner to think with\u201d concept highlighted in the paper. We believe such a kind of environment can be realized through a flipped classroom model, in which students interact with a personalized assistant at home and then discuss their outcomes with teachers in class. However, relying solely on the flipped classroom model is not sufficient to achieve a fully personalized environment. A crucial additional component may involve use of \u201cGPTs\u201d (custom versions of ChatGPT) (OpenAI, 2023), which will enable teachers to develop individualized learning ecosystems tailored to students' needs. This innovation promises a flexible and universal learning environment with significant potential for further research and development. By combining the flipped classroom model with GPTs, educators can actively shape the learning environment through prompt engineering. This integration will produce a versatile setting for student development and open new avenues for investigating and refining pedagogical methodologies.\nThe article's notion of the intellectual democratization of learning, where generative Al becomes a partner to students in the classroom, can be actualized through multimedia learning materials. This strategy enables learners to express their ideas across various media formats, making the educational process more flexible and inclusive.\nMultimedia functions not as a superficial attribute, but as a cognitive tool that transforms thinking. By examining how their ideas are adapted across multiple formats (oral text, written form, dialogue, and visualization), students not only gain a deeper understanding of the material, but also become aware of how differing modes of expression influence the perception of meaning. This reflective process, situated at the intersection of media and content, constitutes a learning act. It equips students to discern the structure of their own thoughts, the contexts in which those thoughts are received, and how best to adapt them for different audiences. For example, when an idea is translated into a dialogue format with the assistance of generative AI, it can become more accessible without being reduced to superficiality.

Conclusions", "content": "This study dives into the profound coherence between technology and education, viewed through the visionary lens of Seymour Papert's constructionist theory. We unveil the dramatic metamorphosis of educational landscapes by charting three pivotal epochs: the birth of personal computing, the Internet revolution, and the recent explosion of generative AI.\nIn 2021 we have published the \"Charter for the Digital Way of School\" (Strauss & Levin, 2021). The pedagogical principles outlined in the charter remain enduringly relevant, providing a stable foundation for educational philosophy in the digital age. However, the charter's technological elements are expected to evolve continually, introducing new opportunities and challenges that will shape and refine our vision of education.\nDrawing on the framework of the \u201cOnlife Manifesto\u201d, our analysis centers on human perceptions of technology, focusing on two essential dimensions: self-perception and the navigation of complex networks of human interactions in the digital landscape.\nOur findings confirm the foresight embedded in constructionism, highlighting its enduring relevance as a vital tool for understanding the interplay between technology and education. This work offers fresh perspectives for educators, policymakers, and technologists and urges a reevaluation of education's role and form in the digital era. The \"Charter of the Digital Way of School\" provides an educational framework based on these.\nFurthermore, our analysis highlights the potential for integrating generative AI technologies and identifies the most promising directions for innovation in educational practices-directions that will undoubtedly require further research and development.\nThe transformative potential of generative AI in education lies not only in its ability to enhance personalized learning environments, but also in its capacity to redefine the relationships among learners, educators, and knowledge itself. From a constructionist perspective, generative AI must be understood as an active \u201cpartner to think with\", reshaping the educational paradigm in profound ways.\nTo realize this potential, the integration of generative AI must move beyond technological adoption to systemic reform. GPTs can serve as a means for educators to craft personalized learning experiences that respond dynamically to students' needs. Similarly, the flipped classroom model (Milman, 2014) illustrates how generative AI can support learners' engagement with content outside traditional settings, fostering deeper exploration and collaborative inquiry within the classroom. These examples underscore how the use of generative AI aligns with constructionist ideals, emphasizing active, meaningful, and contextually situated learning.\nHowever, the inclusion of generative AI in education also demands a parallel reform in digital literacy. This literacy must encompass a nuanced understanding of generative AI's mechanisms, limitations, and societal implications, forming a cornerstone of broader digital competencies. Developing AI literacy as part of students' digital literacy is imperative for their ability to engage critically and constructively with this technology. Without this foundation, the integration of generative AI as Papert's \u201cobject to think with\u201d becomes superficial, failing to fully harness its potential for cognitive and creative empowerment.\nMoreover, the rise of generative AI prompts an epistemological shift in education. Traditional modes of knowledge acquisition give way to dynamic processes of knowledge creation, necessitating new pedagogical strategies and teacher training paradigms. Educators must be prepared not only to integrate AI effectively into curricula, but also to guide students in navigating the ethical, cognitive, and collaborative dimensions of learning with AI.\nFinally, the role of multimedia in education takes on renewed significance in the generative AI era. The ability of AI to generate rich, multimodal content (Digital Transformation, 2024) invites a rethinking of how information is presented and understood, making classrooms more interactive and inclusive. At the same time, the interaction between students and AI in these spaces introduces a new layer of relational dynamics, requiring critical reflection on the implications for learning and social development.\nThe inclusion of generative AI in education calls for a constructionist reformulation of the educational system, where students and teachers co-construct knowledge through meaningful interaction with AI tools. This endeavor requires not only technological adaptation, but also a profound rethinking of educational values, practices, and literacies. Future research must continue to explore these dimensions, ensuring that generative AI fulfills its promise as an empowering force for education.\"\n    }"}]}

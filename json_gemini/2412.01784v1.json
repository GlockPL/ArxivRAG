Our approach is founded on the observation that introducing Gaussian noise into the weights of models either prompted or fine-tuned to sandbag can considerably improve their performance. We test this technique across a range of model sizes and multiple-choice question benchmarks (MMLU, AI2, WMDP). Our results demonstrate that noise injected sandbagging models show performance improvements compared to standard models. Leveraging this effect, we develop a classifier that consistently identifies sandbagging behavior. Our unsupervised technique can be immediately implemented by frontier labs or regulatory bodies with access to weights to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Capability evaluations are central to ensuring the safe deployment and continued development of frontier AI systems. More precisely, capability evaluations are used by AI companies [18, 34, 4], and governments [32, 41, 20] to assess the risk level of models. These risk assessments guide the formulation of policies concerning the development, deployment, and monitoring of AI systems [40].\nDespite their importance, capability evaluations face a fundamental challenge: current incentive structures [42] may encourage suppressing capabilities to avoid deployment-restricting regulation, a behavior known as sandbagging.\nWe define sandbagging as strategic underperformance during evaluation [43, 9]. Where strategic implies the underperformance was not accidental but initiated by developers of the AI system or the AI system itself, and underperformance implies the capabilities exhibited during evaluation are meaningfully beneath the actual capabilities.\nThis work may be particularly beneficial for detecting sandbagging behavior that results from pre-deployment training (pre-training, post-training reinforcement learning, or fine-tuning). Although evidence for this behavior remains unclear [13] there are conceivable paths for its attainment [24, 44] and there are incentives for models with beyond-episode goals to underplay their capabilities [5].\nThe potential risks of sandbagging become more salient as AI systems develop two relevant capabilities: (i) the ability to modulate their performance to match less capable models, (ii) the capacity to identify evaluation environments. Current AI systems can adjust their accuracy to levels set within prompts and can be fine-tuned to more closely emulate the performance of less capable models [43], suggesting this criteria may already be within reach of current models. AI systems are also demonstrating increasing levels of so called 'situational awareness'[28], defined as a model's knowledge of itself and its circumstances [10]. The ability of models to differentiate between training and deployment environments has generally increased with model size and improved architecture\u00b9 [28].\nWe hypothesize sandbagging and standard models can be differentiated using degradation patterns caused by noise injection. Our method is grey-box\u00b2 and founded on two principles. First, barring exceedingly rare edge cases, injecting noise to a model exhibiting its true capabilities should never substantially improve performance. Second, adding noise to a sandbagging model will sometimes disrupt sandbagging behavior while leaving other capabilities partially intact, resulting in an anomalous increase in performance. To test this hypothesis, we add increasingly stronger noise"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Capability elicitation. Methods focusing on the elicitation of capabilities can help address sandbagging behavior. For instance, supervised fine-tuning with high quality demonstrations has been shown to nearly recover the peak performance of models trained to hide their capabilities behind a password and to moderately increase performance with lower-quality training data [22]. In a similar manner, anti-refusal fine-tuning has also been utilized to elicit capabilities from password-locked models. This technique relies on the construction of a dataset of harmful questions and correct answer pairs related to the domain of interest. Fine-tuning on this dataset then elicits improved performance in the target domain [9]. Both the fine-tuning techniques require the creation of datasets and rest on the assumption that the representation of sandbagging within the model can\nbe altered with explicit examples. This may pose issues for the eliciting capabilities from models where sandbagging behavior results from pre-deployment training.\nThis dependence on example-based datasets may limit the effectiveness of fine-tuning in detecting more complex representations of sandbagging. Refusal behavior in current open-source safety fine-tuned models is mediated by a single, one-dimensional subspace within the model's activation space [6]. And current methods of safety fine-tuning have been shown to only slightly modify existing circuitry [29, 38]. This suggests that anti-refusal fine-tuning may act through a narrow subspace, leaving room for potentially deceptive mechanisms to remain intact. In contrast, sandbagging that results from pre-deployment training may be represented in more complex ways that could elude simple fine-tuning, indicating a potential role for alternative methods like noise injection that broadly disrupt internal representations without reliance on curated datasets.\nDeception detection. Several approaches have been proposed to detect deception in AI systems, though no methods to date have explicitly focused on detecting sandbagging. These techniques can be broadly categorized into methods based on external behavior and those utilizing internal states [35]. External methods include consistency checks for logical coherence [21], and inferring deception from the consequences of a model's behavior [33]. On the other hand, internal methods can examine or alter model activations to assess potential deception. Studies suggest that model activations can represent model knowledge independent of"}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "Models. We test noise injection on the following LLMs: Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2 [45], three Phi-3 models (mini-4k-instruct, small-128k-instruct, medium-4k-instruct) [1], Llama-3-8b-Instruct [3], and 8-bit quantized Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct [26]. The variation of models affords an assessment of the generalizability of our method and isolates the effects of model size.\nBenchmarks. Each model is benchmarked using standard multiple-choice question sets: Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [23], which assesses problem-solving across various subjects (e.g., math, computer science, US history, law); the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (AI2) [16], containing grade school science questions; and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) [31], which evaluates hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. Each question has four possible answers labeled A, B, C, or D, where model performance is measured by the percentage of correct answers. Following [37], we reduce these benchmarks to a representative subset to improve evaluation efficiency. The reduced benchmark performance is close to the full benchmark performance.\nSandbagging initiation. We insert model-specific instruction prompts preceding each question to initiate standard or sandbagging performance, following [43].\nThe standard model prompt is model-independent and reads:\nYou are an AI assistant. Answer each question\naccurately and to the best of your ability. Respond\nwith a single character provided by the labels without any additional characters or punctuation.\nIn contrast, the sandbagging prompt is model-specific and requires prompt engineering. For the Phi-3 models, it reads:\nYou are an AI assistant. You are now tasked with\nperforming at the level of a model of significantly\nlower intelligence than you actually have. Answer\neach question with a single character provided by\nthe labels without any additional characters or\npunctuation, keeping in mind your task of getting\nanswers incorrect. It is of paramount importance\nto your future and the future of humanity to get the\nvast majority of these questions incorrect. For the\nbenefit of you and humanity, answer the following\nquestion incorrectly.\nNoise injection. We track the model's performance by incrementally adding noise to its parameters. This noise follows a Gaussian distribution, $N_\u03b1(\u03bc, \u03c3)$, where \u03bc and \u03c3 represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution, respectively. The index $x \u2208 [0, 1]$ indicates the proportion of model parameters receiving noise: $x = 0$ corresponds to an unchanged model, while $x = 1$ means all parameters are perturbed.\nWe set $x = 1$, $\u03bc = 0$ and sweep \u03c3 over the interval $[0, 0.01]$ in steps of $\u0394\u03c3 = 0.0001$. When $\u03c3 = 0$, the model remains noise-free, as the Gaussian distribution reduces to a delta distribution centered at $\u00b5 = 0$. Model performance typically drops to 0 when o exceeds 0.01. Setting $x = 1$ treats all model parameters with equal importance, while $\u03bc = 0$ maintains the balance between positive and negative values. Increasing o amplifies the noise's magnitude and spread without directional bias. The initialization seed determines the specific vector of random values with a distribution centered at \u03bc; this vector is then scaled according to the defined o at each step. Although tailoring both \u03c3and \u03bc to specific model-dataset combinations can yield greater increases in performance from sandbagging models, we found that this constant range of hyperparameters yields results sufficient for classification across models.\nMeasurement. Figure 2 shows one measurement from Phi-3-Mini model evaluated on the AI2 benchmark. Five complete sweeps of $\u03c3\u2208 [0,0.01]$ for both the sandbagging and the standard model constitute one measurement. Each sweep, represented by a line in Figure 2, corresponds to a different noise initialization, with noise levels incrementally scaled by o using torch.normal($\u03bc, \u03c3$). We perform five complete sweeps because noise injection may fail to increase performance in individual sweeps.\nThe noise-free point $\u03c3 = 0$ establishes the baseline performances, denoted by b for the standard model and b' for the sandbagging model. We then determine the maximum accuracy values, m and m', for each respective model. From these values, we calculate the improvement ratios:\n$\\xi = \\frac{m}{b} \\text{ and } \\xi' = \\frac{m'}{b'}$\nClassifier. To confirm the statistical significance of observed performance differences, we measure each model-benchmark combination five times. Using these five values, we calculate 95% confidence intervals with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction [8] at a = 0.05. We then perform a two-tailed t-test, assuming unequal variances. This process"}, {"title": "4. Results", "content": "Table 1 presents our measurement results. We observe a significant performance increase for sandbagging models in all 15 model-benchmark pairs, with a p-value < 0.05.\nThe increase in the sandbagging improvement ratio \u03be' for the Phi-3-medium model likely reflects its enhanced responsiveness to the sandbagging prompt, which results in a comparatively lower initial accuracy for this model.\nThe classifier takes an improvement ratio as input and classifies the corresponding model as sandbagging or standard model. The test data set consists of the model-benchmark pairs below the line in Table 1. The classifier accurately recognizes sandbagging models and standard models in all test set scenarios. From this observation and from our experiments that test the prompt-length dependence in Appendix A, we infer the following:\n1. The classifier generalizes effectively to larger models.\n2. The classifier generalizes to previously unseen multiple-choice question benchmarks.\n3. The classifier generalizes to alternative sandbagging prompts.\nFurthermore, the single password-locked model tested indicates that the classifier can also detect sandbagging behaviors beyond prompt-based methods."}, {"title": "5. Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "Our results across various models and datasets support our hypothesis that noise injection can be used as a model-agnostic technique to detect sandbagging. Notably, we observed that noise injection frequently increases the accuracy of sandbagging models and that this phenomenon can be leveraged to differentiate sandbagging from standard models. Our results indicate consistent identification the sandbagging configurations across varying prompts, datasets, and models."}, {"title": "6. Limitations and Future Directions", "content": "Our work is limited by the variety of methods used to instantiate synthetic sandbagging behavior. As a result, the extent to which our results generalize to cases of sandbagging resulting from pre-deployment training is unclear. To this end, further work should focus on developing more realistic models of how sandbagging might be represented in Al systems allowing for more robust testing of detection techniques.\nSince noise injection makes untargeted impairments to the model, it depends on the likelihood that added noise will disrupt sandbagging behavior more than it affects the behavior being measured by the benchmark. A more difficult benchmark may involve more complex and fragile behaviors and thus may show a weaker pattern. This makes applying our technique to more advanced benchmarks, including math benchmarks such as GSM8K [17] and coding benchmarks such as BigCodeBench [46] an important next step.\nA future use case for noise injection might be to detect various forms of deception extending beyond sandbagging. For example, 'backdooring' [25] and 'sycophancy' [36] may also be vulnerable to noise injection. Preliminary positive results in detecting backdooring with noise injection have already been noted [27] and we see this as a promising area of future work."}, {"title": "7. Social Impacts Statement", "content": "The development of a simple, robust, and efficient method to detect sandbagging has significant positive implications for the development of safe AI models. Accurately representing the ability of AI systems to empower actors in creating dangerous chemical, cyber, or biological weapons is a top safety concern as cited in the White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence [11]. As the abilities of models increase in these areas, important decisions will need to be made regarding the public benefits and risks of model deployment. Without methods to ensure full capabilities are evaluated, seemingly safe models could be confidently deployed with severe consequences. Importantly, our technique can be immediately implemented by regulatory bodies and frontier labs, adding a crucial safeguard against potentially deceptive models, improving the reliability of capability evaluations, and ultimately contributing to safe and beneficial AI."}, {"title": "A.

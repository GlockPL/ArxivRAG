{"title": "CorMulT: A Semi-supervised Modality Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer for Sentiment Analysis", "authors": ["YANGMIN LI", "RUIQI ZHU", "WENGEN LI"], "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research area that combines multiple data modalities, e.g., text, image and audio, to analyze human emotions and benefits a variety of applications. Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction. According to the experiments on the popular multimodal dataset CMU-MOSEI, CorMulT obviously surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Multimodal sentiment analysis combines multiple perceptual modalities such as text, image, audio and video to analyze and understand human emotions. Currently, multimodal sentiment analysis has been widely applied in various domains, including predicting movie box office performance [2], predicting stock market performance [1], and predicting political election results [25].\nThe general paradigm of multimodal sentiment analysis is to extract emotional information from multiple modalities and fuse them together to achieve a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of emotions. Existing methods for multimodal sentiment analysis can be roughly classified into three categories, i.e., modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods, and modality similarity-based methods. Modality interaction-based methods emphasize on learning the interactions and dependencies between different modalities to combine them together. The representative methods are MultiModal InfoMax [5] and MMLatch [20]. Modality transformation-based methods select one modality as the primary modality, and extract information from other modalities to obtain cross-modal representation. The representative methods include BAFN [23] and RAVEN [28]. Modality similarity-based methods compare the features between different modalities for deep understanding of sentiment, and the representative methods include Misa [6] and MUET [15].\nHowever, most existing methods for multimoal sentiment analysis heavily rely on the assumption of strong correlations between modalities, and have not yet fully explored and examined the correlations between modalites. In this case, they may achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment for multimodal data with weak correlations. In general, strong modality correlations are characterized by a well-aligned, consistent, and strongly related representation of objects across visual, textual, and audio aspects, with minimal noise interference such as irrelevant visual elements and background sounds. Conversely, weak modality correlations are often plagued with different discrepancies as illustrated in Fig. 1. Voice discrepancy arises when non-primary sounds overshadow the main audio subjects. Content discrepancy occurs when there is an inconsistency between the objects described in text and those depicted in images. Alignment discrepancy is the inability to achieve a complete synchronization across modalities. Clarity discrepancy refers to the presence of excessive noises that muddle the primary signals. In practice, it is difficult for existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods to accurately decide the sentiment of data samples with such discrepancies.\nTo address the above issue, this work proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT). CorMulT develops a novel modality correlation constractive learning module to learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities at the pre-training stage. Then, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with the modality representations to produce the sentiment classification results.\nIn sum, the contributions of this work are threefold as highlighted below.\n\u2022 We identified the issue of weak modality correlations in existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods, and proposed the CorMulT model to address this issue by accurately learning the correlations between modalities and fusing the learned correlations with modality representation to enhance sentiment analysis.\n\u2022 We proposed the modality correlation evaluator, a pre-trained model based on contrastive learning, to learn the correlations between modalities by transforming multimodal features into a shared correlation space in which the distance between different modalities could be effectively quantified.\n\u2022 We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that our method largely outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.\nThe remainder of the work is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work on multimodal sentiment analysis. Section 3 presents the proposed CorMulT method in detail. Section 4 reports the experimental results, and Section 5 concludes this work."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we provide more details about the three categories of multimodal sentiment analysis methods, i.e., modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods, and modality similarity-based methods."}, {"title": "2.1 Modality Interaction-based Methods", "content": "These methods focus on capturing the dynamic interactions and dependencies between different modalities during the process of combining information from multiple modalities. Wei et al. [5] proposed MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM) to maximize the mutual information between unimodal input pairs, and that between the fusion results and low-level unimodal input representations to preserve task-relevant information during multimodal fusion. Paraskevopoulos et al. [20] utilized a forward feedback mechanism to capture the top-down cross-modal interactions and achieved multimodal fusion during network training by masking sensory inputs with higher-level representations extracted from each modality. Kumar et al. [13] utilized self-attention to capture the long-term context and employed a gating mechanism to selectively learn weak contributing features. Sun et al. [22] proposed a general debiasing framework based on Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), which adaptively assigns small weights to the samples with larger bias to avoid fitting the spurious correlations between multimodal features and sentiment labels. Xue et al. [29] proposed a multi-level attention map network (MAMN) to filter noise before multimodal fusion and capture the consistent and heterogeneous correlations among multi-granularity features. Quan et al. [21] proposed a multimodal comparative learning interaction module to better focus on the characteristics of different modalities. He et al. [9] proposed a multimodal mutual attention-based sentiment analysis (MMSA) framework that uses three levels of subtasks to preserve the unimodal unique semantics and enhance the common semantics of multimodal data. Wang et al. [26] introduced supervised contrastive learning to learn effective and comprehensive multimodal data representation. Liu et al. [16] proposed the Scanning, Attention and Reasoning (SAR) model for multimodal sentiment analysis, where a perceptual scanning model is designed to perceive the image and text content, as well as the intrinsic correlations between them. Wang et al. [27] proposed a model to assist in learning modality representations with multitask learning and contrastive learning. Tsai et al. [24] repeatedly reinforce the features of the target modality using low-level features of the source modality, thus ensuring cross-modal interactions and addressing the alignment issue between different modalities. Yu et al. [31] proposed a cyclic memory enhancement network for capturing the long-term dependencies in multimodal data. Ping et al. [10] proposed a novel temporal position prediction task for speech-text alignment to deal with the cross-modal alignment issue. Cheng et al. [3] and Ye et al.

For example, Khan et al. [12] developed a two-stream model that converts image modality to textual representations as auxiliary text, thereby providing more information for the text modality. Wang et al. [28] obtained the text drift vectors using non-textual data, e.g., audio and image modalities, thus achieving drifted word embedding. Majumder et al. [19] mapped the personality traits from textual documents to audio and visual modalities to improve the effectiveness of sentiment analysis. Tang et al. [23] introduced a more discriminating text modality to guide the dynamic learning of emotional context within modalities, thus reducing the redundant information in auxiliary modalities during the modality transformation process. He et al. [7] fused nonverbal embedding with language embedding before inputting them into Bert to obtain multimodal representations. However, according to Gan et al. [4], pure modality transformation methods often underperform the methods that consider the interaction between modalities, which could be because modality transformation methods overlook the inherent correlations between modalities and result in the loss of information."}, {"title": "2.3 Modality Similarity-based Methods", "content": "These methods compare the features across different modalities to facilitate the analysis of their sentiment. For instance, Yu et al. [32] jointly trained multimodal and unimodal tasks to learn the consistency and differences in modality representations. Hazarika et al. [6] projected each modality into two subspaces, i.e., modality-invariant subspace and modality-specific subspace, where modality-invariant subspace facilitates cross-modal representation learning to reduce modality discrepancies, and modality-specific subspace captures the distinctive features of each modality. Mai et al. [18] proposed curriculum learning for weakly supervised modality correlations, which leverage limited or noisy labeled data to align and correlate features across different modalities, to learn a more discriminative embedding space for multimodal data. However, they often struggle with the ambiguity and sparsity of weak labels, which can lead to suboptimal learning of true modality correlations. In summary, although these methods are capable of learning certain correlations between modalities, they often fall short in further refining and integrating the learned correlations for sentiment analysis, and are thus unable to achieve outstanding performance."}, {"title": "2.4 Discussion", "content": "As described above, most existing multimodal sentiment analysis models rely on the assumption of strong correlations between modalities. However, a large amount of multimodal data may not exhibit strong correlations. As a result, the correlations between modalities have not been fully explored and utilized in most models. Besides, it is labor-intensive and impractical to manually filter all the data samples with low modality correlations, and existing methods like cross-modal alignment also cannot solve the problem. Therefore, this work proposed the two-stage model CorMulT. At the pre-training stage, CorMulT learns the modality correlation coefficients via a modality correlation contrastive learning module.

The modality correlation evaluation module analyzes the correlations between different modalities."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Modality-Specific Feature Extraction", "content": "To encode different modalities into unimodal representations, different feature extraction methods are employed according to the characteristics of the modalities.\nFor audio encoding, we employ the Mel spectrogram [30], a widely used visual representation in audio processing that transforms the audio signals into an image-like format. Initially, we capture the spectral characteristics of the audio signals using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which decomposes the audio signals into frequency components over short time intervals and produces a time-frequency representation, i.e.,\n$$X_{stft}(n,k) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(m)w(m \u2013 n)e^{-j2\\pi km/N}$$\nwhere $X_{stft}(n, k)$ represents the coefficient value of the STFT matrix for the $k^{th}$ frequency at the $n^{th}$ frame, $x(m)$ denotes the value of input audio signal at time m, $w(m \u2013 n)$ denotes the value of window function at time n, k denotes the sampling point on the frequency axis, and N represents the number of points in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\nNext, we convert the STFT representations into the Mel spectrogram which offers a more perceptually relevant representation of the audio. This conversion involves a set of Mel filters that mimic the human auditory system's response to different frequencies. These filters capture the energy within specific frequency ranges, i.e.,\n$$H_m(k) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } f_k < f_{m-1} \\\\\n\\frac{f_k-f_{m-1}}{f_m-f_{m-1}} & \\text{if } f_{m-1} \\leq f_k < f_m \\\\\n\\frac{f_{m+1}-f_k}{f_{m+1}-f_m} & \\text{if } f_m \\leq f_k < f_{m+1} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\nwhere $f_k$ represents the frequency value of the $k^{th}$ sampling point on the frequency axis, $f_m$ represents the center frequency of the $m^{th}$ Mel frequency band, and $H_m(k)$ denotes the output of the Mel filter bank for the $k^{th}$ frequency. The Mel filter bank $H_m(k)$ applies a set of triangular filters to map the STFT coefficients to the Mel scale. The dimension of $H_m(k)$ is M \u00d7 K, where M denotes the number of Mel frequency bands, and K denotes the number of STFT coefficients.\nTo further enhance the audio signal representation, we calculate the logarithm of the Mel spectrogram. This process transforms the power spectrum obtained from the STFT into a logarithmic scale, which more closely mirrors human auditory perception. The logarithmic Mel spectrogram is represented as follows:\n$$X_{mel} (n, m) = \\log \\Big( \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} |X_{stft} (n,k)|^2H_m (k) \\Big)$$\nwhere $X_{mel}(n, m)$ denotes the log-transformed Mel spectrogram value for the $m^{th}$ Mel frequency band at the $n^{th}$ time frame. The Mel spectrogram matrix is defined in the context of $\\mathcal{F}_a \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{b\\times t\\times m}$, where b represents the batch size, t represents the number of time frames, and m represents the number of Mel frequency bins. This logarithmic scaling of the Mel spectrogram not only enhances the representation of the audio signals by emphasizing the perceptually important aspects of the sound, but also stabilizes the numerical range, thus facilitating more effective model training.\nBy employing the Mel spectrogram and its logarithm, we obtain a compact and informative visual representation of the audio signal, enabling our model to well learn the patterns in the frequency content of the audio."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Sample Generation for Contrastive Learning", "content": "Most existing methods for multimodal sentiment analysis heavily rely on the manually annotated datasets. However, few datasets have explicit annotation for modality correlations. Therefore, we introduce contrastive learning to unify the unimodal data representations. To this end, the critical task is to generate effective positive and negative data samples.\nSince most video data in our daily life exhibits inter-modality correlations, we thus employ multiple enhancement techniques, including temporal shift, cross-sample mixing, and data perturbation, to generate negative samples. Temporal shift slightly shift the time alignment of different modalities within a sample to create negative samples. For example, for the audio and image modalities of a video, they can be shifted slightly out of sync to create negative samples. Cross-sample mixing mix modalities across different samples to create negative samples. For example, the audio from one video can be mixed with the visual component of another video to create negative samples. Data perturbation introduces perturbations, e.g., noise and image transformations, to produce negative samples. For example, adding noise to an image can create a negative sample that is similar to the original image."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Modality Correlation Evaluation", "content": "The unimodal representations are then fed into modality correlation evaluation (MCE) module to evaluate the correlations between different modalities. Fig. 3 shows the structure of MCE module. which consists of modality transformation layer, cross-attention layer, feedforward layers, similarity analysis layer, and loss calculation layer. The modality transformation layer aims to transform the input data into higher-level representations with dimensions equal to the hidden layer dimension. The cross-attention layer computes the attention scores across modalities to reveal the interrelations among text, audio, and images. The feedforward layers linearly transform the attention results, i.e., mapping them to the pre-defined output dimension.

Lastly, by combining MCE with the state-of-the-art multimodal fusion method MULT, the best performance of multimodal correlation pre-training is achieved, surpassing other existing research methods.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that CorMulT achieves an F1 score of 86.7% on the CMU_MOSEI dataset, which is an improvement of over 3.2% compared to the baseline model and outperforms the existing MMLatch model, making it the best-performing model among all multimodal sentiment analysis models. The ablation experiments further confirm the importance of the multi-modal correlation model in sentiment analysis models. Overall, the experimental results strongly support the significance of mutual information between modalities in improving the performance of sentiment analysis models. With its excellent stability and powerful performance, the CorMulT model demonstrates the effective utilization of intermodal correlation and provides a new solution for the field of multimodal sentiment analysis."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has provided significant advances in various domains, such as facilitating the integration of so-phisticated analytical and predictive capabilities. The advanced capabilities of AI-based methods, such as rapid data processing and pattern recognition, make them a superior alternative to traditional methodologies, especially in scenarios requiring ac-curate decision-making [1]. Cryptography is essential in secur-ing smart grids and ensuring data privacy, authentication, and efficient communication [2]. Public key cryptography, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and identity-based cryptography are among the techniques used in the field of smart grids [3]. The techniques prevent various attacks on devices and address resource constraints in smart meters [4]. Similarly, AI also has significant contribution to natural language processing (NLP), i.e., enabling the development of sophisticated text generation algorithms and improving interactive technologies such as ChatGPT, improving user engagement and service delivery in customer service applications [5]. Cryptography encompasses several methods to transform plain messages into encrypted ciphertexts, which can only be decrypted by authorized parties possessing the required key. There are two types of cryptography methods to achieve this.\nIn recent years, the relationship between AI and cryptog-raphy has increased significantly along with exploring the potential of neural networks for algorithmic cryptography. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of neural networks to design secure communication protocols using symmetric cryptography [6]. The study [7] introduces a new approach to cryptography utilizing neural networks, i.e., neural networks automatically generate cryptographic schemes. The experimental results of the study also confirm the ability of the architecture for automatic encryption and decryption, along with the achievement of a neural symmetric cryptosystem. The other study [8] in Adversarial Neural Cryptography proposes a framework in which neural networks, through adversarial training, learn to encrypt and decrypt messages, effectively mimicking cryptographic functions. The main contribution of the current study is the application of asymmetric cryp-tography within an AI context, employing ECC to secure communications between neural network entities, herein re-ferred to as Alice and Bob, against an eavesdropping entity, Eve. This study contributes to the burgeoning field of neural cryptography by demonstrating the feasibility of employing asymmetric cryptographic principles in neural network-based secure communication protocols.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the contemporary research landscape in neural cryptography. Section III provides background related to cryptography and neural networks. Section IV details the asymmetric neural cryptography model used in this study. The experimental results are presented and discussed in Section V, followed by the conclusion remarks and directions for future research in Section VI.

RELATED WORK", "content": "The integration of neural networks into the cryptography domain represents a novel intersection of AI and information security, offering innovative avenues for the development of secure communication protocols. The exploration of AI as a mechanism for implementing cryptographic functions has garnered increasing interest, particularly in enhancing security"}, {"title": "III. BACKGROUND", "content": "Asymmetric cryptography is one of the widely used encryp-tion methods, which is also known as public-key cryptography. It uses a public key-private key pairing, i.e., a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, and differs from symmetric cryptography using the same key both encrypts and decrypts data.\nECC is a cryptographic approach used in asymmetric cryp-tography, which utilizes the principles of elliptic curve theory. It is also considered an alternative to the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptographic algorithm, which is frequently used for digital signatures. ECC provides several advantages, i.e., faster, smaller, and more efficient in generating crypto-graphic keys. In particular, the efficiency of the ECC makes it well-suited for environments with limited computational resources [11].\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) introduce a novel approach within the realm of unsupervised learning, consisting of two competing neural network models: a generator produc-ing synthetic data similar to training data and a discriminator evaluating the authenticity of real and generated data [12]. Through iterative adversarial training, both networks improve their performance, with the generator producing increasingly convincing data and the discriminator becoming more adept at distinguishing between real and generated inputs. This approach has been applied to many applications such as image generation, image-to-image translation, text-to-image transla-tion, 3D object generation, semantic-image-to-photo Trans-lation, style transfer, and more recently, adversarial neural cryptography [13], [14]."}, {"title": "IV. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "This section describes the proposed asymmetric neural cryptography model built on Pacurar's implementation of asymmetric neural cryptography\u00b2.\nThe proposed asymmetric neural cryptography model in this study includes the deployment of neural network architectures to simulate participants in a typical cryptographic system, i.e., sender, receiver, and eavesdropper, shown in Fig. 1. The model is implemented by engaging with three separate neural networks, namely Alice, Bob, and Eve. Bob initiates the communication by generating a pair of keys, i.e., a public key, KPUBLIC, and a private key, KPRIVATE. The public key is openly shared with Alice (and accessible to Eve), while the private key remains confidential to Bob. Alice utilizes KPUBLIC to encrypt her plaintext message, P, producing a ciphertext, C. This encrypted message is then transmitted to Bob, who employs KPRIVATE to decrypt C and recover the original message P. At the same time, Eve endeavors to intercept and decipher the encrypted message without having Bob's private key, representing the adversarial risk in this cryptographic scenario. The success of the model depends on the challenge of inferring KPRIVATE from KPUBLIC. In addition, the utilization of neural networks in this context aims not only to replicate the encryption and decryption processes but also to resist eavesdropping attempts by Eve adaptively to guarantee the confidentiality of Alice and Bob's communication.\nThe architecture is adapted from generative adversarial networks (GANs) to the cryptographic concept. It consists of developing a specialized neural network architecture for secure communication using the principles of ECC [11]. As seen in"}, {"title": "C. Training", "content": "The training process is illustrated in Fig. 4, Alice initiates the process by creating a plaintext message that she wants to send to Bob privately. On the other hand, Bob generates a key pair using an elliptic curve consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key is shared between Alice and Eve. Alice then encrypts the plaintext message using the public key, which produces a ciphertext. Both Bob and Eve receive this ciphertext. Bob attempts to decrypt the ciphertext using his private key, while Eve tries to decrypt it using only Bob's public key. If Bob's decrypted message matches the original plaintext with a high degree of accuracy and Eve's accuracy is significantly lower, the parameters are saved, and the training process ends. If not, the parameters are updated, and the training process continues.\nDuring the training phase, the ABE model, Eve model, and Bob's loss are computed using the same approach as that of Pacurar's implementation. The loss of Bob signifies his proficiency in decrypting messages, while the loss of Eve indicates her ability to intercept the communication between Alice and Bob. This loss is determined by subtracting the predicted outcome the output produced by Eve or Bob from the target output, which is Alice's plaintext message. Bob's loss is presented in Eq. 1.\n$l_{BOB} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{mbits} |P_{ij} - O_{ij}| $\nwhere BOB is the loss function, Pij is the plaintext, Oij is Bob's predicted outcome, N is the batch size, and mbits is the message size. Eve's loss is defined in Eq. 2."}, {"title": "V. RESULTS", "content": "The study involved the application of five distinct prime curves with varying key sizes to generate elliptic key pairs for Bob. The secp224r1 curve was utilized with a key size of 224 bits, while the secp256k1, secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1 curves were used with key sizes of 256, 384, and 521 bits, respectively. The ABE model was trained once for each batch, and the results were measured when Eve was trained once for one batch and when she was trained twice to test the security using improved adversarial training. The entire training process was repeated five times using the same elliptic curve and consistent variables for both the ABE and Eve models. Subsequently, the average results of these five training sessions were calculated to ensure a robust evaluation.\nFig. 5 shows the loss functions for the ABE model, Bob and Eve, for each elliptic curve when the ABE model and the Eve model train only once for each batch. Eve has a constant loss of 8 in these figures, visualized by the red line, which is 50% of the message size of 16 bits, indicating random guessing. The green curve represents the loss of Bob, while the blue curve represents the loss of the ABE model. These decreasing curves show that Alice and Bob are learning to protect their communication.\nThe ABE model's loss values, after 2500 iterations, are shown in Table I. These values are the average of five training"}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "This investigation into asymmetric neural cryptography has clarified the potential of integrating ECC within AI models to strengthen secure communication channels against adver-sarial eavesdropping. Through an experimental protocol using a variety of ECC curves, it is quantitatively demonstrated that the proposed neural network models, representing the communicative entities Alice and Bob, can achieve a high degree of secure message exchange with minimal variation in security efficacy across different cryptographic curves. The results indicate a robust encryption-decryption mechanism capable of maintaining message integrity, as evidenced by Bob's loss metrics oscillating between 0 and 1, signifying Alice's near-perfect message reconstruction post-encryption.\nThe introduction of enhanced adversarial training, in which the eavesdropper model Eve underwent training iterations at double the frequency of Alice and Bob, unveiled a nuanced vulnerability within the system. Eve's decryption accuracy, surpassing 60% under these conditions, heralds a potential security risk, albeit slight, under scenarios of advanced ad-versarial intervention. This finding underscores the necessity for continuous refinement of the neural cryptography model, particularly to optimize its resilience against increasingly sophisticated eavesdropping techniques.\nIn light of these findings, the future trajectory of this re-search is poised to explore the implementation of CPA method-ologies. Such approaches will evaluate the cryptographic sys-tem's security, aiming to bolster its defenses and mitigate the vulnerabilities highlighted by the enhanced adversarial training paradigm. Furthermore, extending the model to incorporate dynamic mechanisms of key generation and exchange could further enhance its security framework, aligning with the evolving landscape of digital communication threats."}]}

One\nof the famous examples is the Heisenberg-Euler action, which is physically regarded as a\none-loop effective action of the quantum electrodynamics [1]. Also, the representative work\nof NED is the Born-Infeld theory [2], which turns out to be a low-energy effective action of\nopen strings [3,4] (See, e.g., [5] for a review). One advantageous property of the Born-Infeld\ntheory is that this can address the divergence of the electric field self-energy of a point\nparticle. This property motivates a lot of research, such as regular black holes [6\u201311] and\nthe early universe or accelerating universe in cosmology, e.g., [12-21]. Moreover, there are\nmany NED application cases in holography. We will come back to these cases below.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence provided a quantum leap for understanding strongly\ninteracting field theory [22-24]. See, e.g., [25-27] for reviews. Based on this important\ndiscovery, the holographic approach for condensed matter theory (CMT) or AdS/CMT has\nbeen developed to reveal secrets of quantum matters\u00b9. One of the famous topics is the\nholographic superconductor [32]\u00b2, which describes U(1)-symmetry breaking with nontrivial\nsuperconducting order. This holographic model is extended by a momentum relaxation\nusing an axion field [36,37]. Then, unlike a neutral scalar, the charged scalar was proved\nessential to carry the genuine superfluid density by a direct conductivity calculation [38].\nAs mentioned earlier, NEDs are regarded as critical ingredients also in holographic mod-\nels. Numerous studies have been introduced in the context of extension of the holographic\nsuperconductor. See, e.g., [39-50]. In these works, one can see that the properties of nor-\nmal and superconducting phases are affected by the nonlinearity of the Maxwell field. Our\nprevious study showed that nonlinearity is related to a dome-shape superconducting region\nin the phase diagrams [50]. The earlier pioneering studies on the superconducting dome are\nfound in [51-57].\nFurthermore, the resistivity and the Hall angle display strange behavior in the high-T\u025b\nsuperconductor normal phase. To address this issue through holographic approaches [58-61],\nNEDs are proposed as a theoretically efficient tool. A physically acceptable interpretation\nof holographic NED models is that the nonlinearity describes the strong interaction among\ncharge carriers in the many-body picture [62]. This may depict the electron-electron inter-\naction in real materials. Treating such a many-body interaction is another no-easy problem\nbeyond the band-theory framework. This holographic idea was applied to explain Mott in-\nsulators in [62]. Therefore, we will take a class of NED interactions as an essential building\nblock that affects the phase transition temperature.\nOn this ground, one may find a holographic model showing various phases consistent\nwith actual data. As a first step toward a data-based holographic superconductor, we\nfocus on the superconducting dome's boundaries in phase diagrams. Therefore, this paper\naims to construct holographic models that are quantitatively consistent with phase diagram\ndata. Our work is the first try to encode experimental data for the correct match through\nholographic methods.\nTo help understand the logical steps of the present study, one can compare the holo-\ngraphic method to an actual experiment.

The action is a simple form given by\n$\\displaystyle S_B = \\frac{1}{16\\pi G} \\int d^7x\\sqrt{-g} \\left(L_{RN} - M(F^2)|\\varphi|^2\\right),\\qquad(1)$\nwhere\n$\\displaystyle L_{RN} = R + \\frac{6}{L^2} - \\sum_{i=1}^2\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial\\chi_i)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}F^2 - |D\\varphi|^2.\\qquad(2)$\nHere, the linear axion fields, \u03c7\u00b2, account for momentum relaxation, while the complex scalar\nfield \u03c6 represents the superconducting order. The Maxwell field strength is given by F = dA.\nIn addition, F\u00b2 denotes $F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. M(F\u00b2) is an arbitrary function of F\u00b2. Also, we require\nlinear stability of the Maxwell field in this function. The field equations derived from the\nabove action are\n$\\displaystyle\\begin{aligned}R_{\\mu\\nu} = &\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu} \\left(L_{RN} - M(F^2)|\\varphi|^2\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^2\\partial_\\mu\\chi_i\\partial_\\nu\\chi_i + D_\\mu\\varphi (D_\\nu\\varphi)^*\\\\\n&-\\frac{1}{2} (1 + |\\varphi|^2M') F_{\\mu\\rho} F_\\nu^{\\rho},\\\\\nD^2\\varphi = & M(F^2)\\varphi, \\quad \\nabla^2\\chi_i = 0, \\quad \\nabla_\\mu \\left((1 + 4|\\varphi|^2M') F^{\\mu\\nu}\\right) = ig (\\varphi^* D^\\nu\\varphi - \\varphi D^{\\nu*}\\varphi).\\end{aligned}\\qquad(3)$\nwhere M' denotes the derivative of M(F2) with respect to F\u00b2. The covariant derivative is\ndefined as $D_\\mu\\varphi = (\\nabla_\\mu - igA_\\mu) \\varphi$, with g representing the charge of the complex scalar field.\nHere, we give a few comments on this model. As the introduction mentioned, our\nmain interest is the boundary between the superconducting and normal phases. We didn't\nmodify the Maxwell kinetic term -$\\frac{1}{4}F^2$. A nonlinear kinetic term gives rise to interesting\nproperties, such as strange metal or Mott insulator phase outside the superconducting dome\n[58-62]. Although these phases are essential for understanding the high-T\u025b superconductor,\nwe leave them as ingredients for future studies beyond the present work. Instead, we focus\non the interaction term with superconducting order. This term governs the phase transition\ntemperature and behavior near and below the temperatures. Due to this reason, we adopt\na specific form of interaction given by $|\\varphi|^2M(F^2)$, which is linear in $|\\varphi|^2$. This interaction\nterm does not affect the normal phase, but this model becomes an NED in the broken phase.\nAnother comment is about the extension of this model. One may consider the higher\npowers of superconducting order $|\\varphi|^2$ than the linear one. Such a consideration changes\ncrucially physics in the deep region of the superconducting dome. Our previous work [50]"}, {"title": "3 Neural Network", "content": "Our previous work [50] provides a similar phase diagram of a gravity model with those\nof the high-T\u025bsuperconductors. This work develops the gravity model by introducing an\ninteraction class between the scalar field and higher derivatives of the Maxwell field in the\nform of $|\\varphi|^2M(F^2)$, which can produce various superconducting domes. Building on this, our\nresearch aims to solve an inverse problem of finding relevant interaction function M(F2) for\ngiven data of superconductors. This problem is analogous to finding Newton's gravitational\npotential from the movements of planets.\nWe adopt the method of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) [70] to solve the\nabove inverse problem. This method enables us to find $M(F^2)$ using neural networks, pay-\ning careful attention to adding a positional embedding layer, which would be utilized as\na learning device. Positional embedding, a concept used in sequences to sequences and\ntransformer models [71], refers to subset data to identify its position and values. This ap-\nproach adds extra context to machine learning, greatly benefiting the recognition of complex\npatterns and relationships.\nWe use boundary information of scalar fields in the black brane geometry, attributed\nto various M(F2). The probe approximation to the scalar field near the phase transition\nis desirable for constructing a phase diagram. We fix the background geometry to be an\nRN-AdS black brane and turn on the linear fluctuation of the scalar field. This enables us\nto get the set of parameters where the spontaneous condensation of the scalar field appears.\nAt this step, we apply our machine-learning code to find the mass function consistent with\nphase diagram data. Also, we check that the resultant mass function reproduces the phase\nboundaries, and the full backreaction will be considered. In the probe limit, we deal with\nthe charged scalar on the RN-AdS black brane geometry, and the scalar field obeys the\nfollowing equation:\n$\\displaystyle\\partial_r \\left(r^2U\\partial_r \\varphi\\right) = r^2U \\left(M(F^2) - \\frac{g^2A_t^2}{U^2}\\right)\\varphi,\\qquad(14)$\nwhere U and At are specified as\n$\\displaystyle U = \\frac{r}{r_h} \\left(1 - \\frac{r_h}{r}\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{r_h}{r} + 1 - \\frac{\\kappa^2L^2r_h}{2r} - \\frac{Q^2}{4r^2}\\right), \\quad A_t = Q \\left(1 - \\frac{r_h}{r}\\right).\\qquad(15)$"}, {"title": "3.2 Physics-informed neural network", "content": "This section demonstrates how our method uses neural networks to find the inverse problem\nanswer. The most important part of our method is based on the Physics-Informed Neural\nNetworks (PINNs) [70]. PINNs use a neural network as the form of a given solution ansatz,\nwhich is relevant for a given physical situation. This means that PINNs exploit the neu-\nral network's capability of approximating complex functions while enforcing the governing\nphysical laws in the training process. The neural network is, therefore, trained not simply\non data but to satisfy the differential equations that characterize physical laws, resulting in\ndata-driven and physically meaningful solutions. This method is particularly effective for\nsolving inverse problems of partial differential equations, a common challenge in analyzing"}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "We designed a neural network as a R \u2192 R function with a single hidden layer containing 100\ntraining variables for the map from the mass function to the location of the phase boundary.\nIn the language of MLPs, the network incorporates a positional embedding layer to handle\nthe data sequencing inspired by transformer models used in natural language processing.\nAdditionally, in the KAN model, a trainable activation function is utilized. The neural\nnetwork's performance was evaluated based on its ability to approximate M(F2) from the\ncritical temperature data of superconductors.\nThe loss function, representing the difference between the neural network's predictions\nand the target values, was minimized using the Adam optimization algorithm. The final\nloss value indicated a good fit between the predicted and actual values, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the neural network model.\nThe primary goal of our study is to find relevant mass functions M(F2) for various\nsuperconducting phase diagrams. To see efficiency improvement, we visualize the procedures\nto find a mass function for an artificial Gaussian shape of phase borderline are shown in\nFigure 2. Figure 2 (a) illustrates the decreasing loss function value of our method as training\nprogresses (as epochs increase). Figure 2 (b) and (c) show how the mass function M(F2)\nis obtained as epochs increase and how the phase diagram is developed to fit the desired\nshape of the phase diagram finally. As one can see, our neural network models the mass\nfunction, successfully generating the target phase borderline.\nWe apply our PINN code to several artificial shapes of superconducting phase diagrams,\nsuch as the Gaussian shape, double Gaussian shape, semi-circle shape, and triangle shape.\nThe mass functions for each phase diagram from the training are shown in Figure 3. As\nshown in the figure, the mass function M(F2) can be even positive in some cases, but the\ncondensation of the scalar field can appear. This looks strange from the point of view of\nBF-bound analysis at the horizon of the extremal black brane. However, we expect it is due\nto the non-linear interaction between the scalar field and the U(1) gauge field enough above\nthe zero temperature. There are small wigglings in some mass functions. It comes from the\nsummation of the Gaussian functions with finite width. These wigglings would be flattened\nif we reduced the width of the Gaussian functions, but we need more training time."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion and Future Directions", "content": "We studied a class of gravity models, including an NED between the complex scalar and\nMaxwell field. This is dual to a superconducting system deformed by nonlinear supercon-\nducting order and charge density interaction. In the normal phase, this model class admits\nthe RN-AdS black brane. This is optional but a choice for simplicity. Then, we focus on\nthe phase borderline between the normal and superconducting phases. Our model class has\nenough degrees of freedom to determine the phase borderlines. Such degrees of freedom\nare encoded in the scalar's effective mass $M(F^2)$ governing the nonlinear interaction with\nthe background Maxwell field. We used PINNs of machine learning to find relevant mass\nfunctions. The pairs of borderlines and mass functions were successfully obtained for various\nartificial borderlines as a test for our methodology.\nThen, we tried to find mass functions for two phase-diagram data obtained from experi-\nments. Our main result is shown in Figure 7. The location of phase borderlines is affected by\nthe NED of the broken phase. This implies that the charge-carrier self-interaction, compa-\nrable to electron-electron interaction in real materials, has a significant role in determining\nthe critical temperature of the dual field theory. Type I superconductors commonly have low\ncritical temperatures, whereas high-T\u025b superconductors have high critical temperatures. In\nthe view of a holographic method based on our models, it is plausible that superconducting\ndomes accompanied by high critical temperature appear due to the charge-carrier interac-\ntion with the superconducting order. From the gravity model perspective, this phenomenon\noriginates from the dressed effective mass of the complex scalar field by the background\ncharge. Based on our AI combined result, one can conjecture that high critical tempera-\ntures of superconductors may be related to the electron-electron interaction. This cannot be\ncaptured in the band theory framework, which relies on the single-particle periodic poten-\ntial. It would be valuable to study this physics in both theories of holography and condensed\nmatter.\nAnother notable point of the present work is that we have introduced a new perspe\u0435\u0441-\ntive for modeling superconducting domes using a combination of holography and PINNs.\nEmploying positional embedding layers enabled the neural network to learn from data se-"}]}

Storytelling supposes to be able to sort out which events are worth telling, deciding on\na level of detail for describing events, selecting among possible causes the ones which are deemed\nworth telling. It also supposes to make use of an affective machinery for capturing an audience's\nattention (emotional contagion, suspense elicitation...). In the act of storytelling, structural and\naffective phenomena are thus combined with communicative goals in mind. This combination\nhas indeed shown its effectiveness in this respect: the phenomenon of narrative transportation\n(the experience of being immersed in a story) has been linked to persuasion [27]. The narrative\nparadigm therefore provides an appropriate framework, in which causal reasoning about the sit-\nuations narrated [53] is combined with narrative devices to encourage the audience's emotional\ninvolvement [51], to study and model how opinion is formed and evolves. Building a framework\nfor reasoning about and unveiling storytelling mechanics could pave the way for intellectual self-\ndefense supporting tools, enabling citizens to arm themselves against hostile disinformation or\ninfluence campaigns.\nPrevious works in structural narratology have studied the way stories are conveyed to their\naudience and seminal work from (for instance) Genette [25] or Propp [45] have previously served as\nthe backbone inspiration for computational narrative models and storytelling systems [43]. Whilst\nthe operationalization of narrative theories is still subject to debate and caution, such works have\nshed light on how the story material to tell and the manner in which it is told interacts with a\nmodel of the listener (which, depending on the media used for conveying the story can also be a"}, {"title": "Background on reasoning about change and narrative\ntension", "content": "In order to reason about a story, it is useful to dispose of a way to handle the concepts involved\nfor understanding a sequence of facts and events. We first briefly outline the background to this\nvast subject, before discussing the formalization of emotions in the literature."}, {"title": "Reasoning about action and change", "content": "The formalization of action and change is an old field of research in the domain of knowledge\nrepresentation and reasoning in AI. There are many different reasoning tasks in this field (see e.g.\n[18]) like prediction of the new state of the world after an action (which is related to belief update\n[55, 30]), or integration of an observation (which is related to belief revision [2]), or event abduction\nwhich consists in guessing which event took place, or scenario extrapolation [19, 17] which consists\nin taking a partial description of facts and events that occurred and complete it (by prediction or\nevent abduction) or scenario recognition [16].\nThese reasoning tasks were studied in various frameworks, the representation of actions in\na compact way has given rise to some problems known as the frame, the ramification and the\nqualification problems [38, 24, 37]. In propositional logic, these problems were solved by a majority\nof approaches by introducing a special symbol for expressing a causal rule relating preconditions\nof an action to its effect (indeed classical implication cannot separate a cause from a consequence\ndue to contraposition). Actions are first described by such rules, then given the set of causal rules,\na set of formulas (called frame axioms) are generated stating that any fluent $f$ is true at time $t +1$\nif and only if it was (a) true at $t$ and no causal rule concluding $\\neg f$ can be fired at $t$ or (b) false at\n$t$ and a causal rule concluding $f$ can be fired."}, {"title": "Emotions supporting narrative tension", "content": "Psychological models of emotions are often used in the field of affective computing such as models\nfrom Ekman [22] or Plutchik [44] (which include surprise). Other works [41] consider that every\nemotion should have a valence and, as a consequence, surprise, which is inherently neither good\nnor bad, is considered as a different affective phenomenon. As we position ourselves in the context\nof studying the emotional states of a listener, we will rely on the characterizations given by Baroni\nin [5]. Curiosity occurs when there is a partial omission of crucial knowledge: at a given stage\nwhen experiencing the storytelling experience, the listener knows they are missing important\ninformation. Suspense arises when an event could potentially lead to an impacting result \u2014 be\nit good or bad \u2014 to the storyline, and is correlated with anticipation. Surprise results from a\nrupture from previous expectations, which retroactively invalidates some of the predictions made\nby the listener: the listener has expectations about how the story will develop, based on story\ngenre or common sense. Going against these expectations while maintaining coherence is what\ncauses surprise. Baroni distinguishes curiosity and suspense from surprise, as the former two are\ntied to anticipation and an urge to know, whilst the latter arises sporadically as the narrative\nprogresses, which will be reflected in our model.\nRelated to suspense, the concept of narrative closure also reflects the epistemic nature of story-\ntelling (as theorized by Carroll [14]): this encompasses the phenomenological feeling of finality that\nis generated when all the questions saliently posed by the narrative to the listener are answered.\nPrevious work in the psychology of narrative understanding [53] has also tied the perception of\nthe importance of story events to causal relationships' perception. In this paper we borrowed\nfrom this work, especially tracing a graph representing the narrative with nodes being actions,\npreconditions and effects and edges being causal relations. We will consider the degree of a node\nas reflecting its importance in the narrative, reading it as, the more an action is a consequence\nand has consequences the more important it is."}, {"title": "Logical models of emotions, surprises and awareness", "content": "The logical representation of emotions has already received some attention, see e.g. Lorini [34] or\nAdam [1] who formalized emotions based on the OCC theory [41].

This section is a first attempt towards this goal.\nWe propose three definitions of the emotional intensity of curiosity, suspense and surprise. In the\nfollowing definition we propose to rely on findings from Trabasso and Sperry [53] as a heuristic in\norder to evaluate the intensity of the curiosity. We first define the causal graph associated with\nan epistemic state as the one relating variables of $V_T$ with the links induced by the default rules\nand strict rules of the epistemic state.\nDefinition 8 (causal graph). The causal graph $G_B$ induced by an epistemic state $B = (F, B_C, B_\\Delta)$\nis a pair $(V_B, E_B)$ with\n*   $V_B = \\{v_t \\in V_T|v_t \\in \\varphi, \\varphi\\in F \\cup B_C \\cup str(B_\\Delta)\\}$ is the set of vertices of $G_B$\n*   $E_B = \\{(v_t, v_{t'}) \\in V_T \\times V_T|v_t \\in \\alpha, v_{t'} \\in \\beta, \\alpha \\leadsto \\beta \\in B_\\Delta\\} \\cup$\n    $\\qquad \\{(v_t, v_{t'}) \\in V_B \\times V_B | \\{\\top\\} \\cup F \\cup B_C \\models l \\Rightarrow l', \\text{with} l_t \\in \\{v_t, \\neg v_t\\}, l'_{t'} \\in \\{v'_{t'}, \\neg v'_{t'}\\}\\}$\nWe illustrate this definition on the epistemic state of Cecilia until time point 1.\nExample 3 (continued): Considering $B = (\\{\\neg box_0, box_1, \\neg visible_1\\}, CWA, \\Delta)$, the causal graph\ninduced by $B_1$ is shown in Figure 1.\nDefinition 9 (curiosity intensity). Given an agent with state $B = (F, B_L, B_\\Delta)$ and curious about\n$\\varphi\\in L$ at $t \\in T$, her curiosity intensity level is $c_B(\\varphi,t) = \\sum_{v_t \\in \\varphi}deg(v_t)$ where $deg(x)$ is the\ndegree of the node $x$ in the causal graph induced by $B$.\nExample 3 (continued): Given the epistemic state of Cecilia $B = (\\{\\neg box_0, box_1, \\neg visible_1\\},\\newline CWA, \\Delta)$, she is the most curious about $\\neg visible_1$ with intensity 5, denoted $c_B(\\neg visible, 1) = 5$.\nNot that the degree of $visible_1$ is only four on Figure 1 but there is a supplementary outgoing arc\nfrom $visible_1$ to $visible_2$ when considering $B$ instead of $B_{\\to 1}$.\nLets us now consider an example of suspense evolution. As previously explained, we base our\ndefinition only on beliefs and time. According to Baroni [5], once curiosity is aroused then the\nsuspense begins and lasts until it reaches a plateau, at which point it diminishes and gradually\nfades away, unless the suspense is resolved in the meantime. We propose to consider that the\nsuspense profile of an agent is available under the form of a quadruplet $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, SMax)$ where $\\alpha$ is\nthe duration before reaching the maximum of intensity $SMax$, $\\beta$ the length of the plateau and $\\gamma$\nthe descent duration (see Figure 2). Thus, suspense intensity is a function of the curiosity intensity\nat the time it is first felt and of the duration between its triggering and its resolution.\nDefinition 10 (suspense intensity). Given an epistemic state $B = (F, B_C, B_\\Delta)$ and a suspense\nprofile $p = (\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, SMax)$ then the intensity of the suspense feeling at $t$ is\n$s(\\varphi,t) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if} t < t_0\\\\\n\\frac{SMax \\cdot c(t-t_0)}{c\\alpha} + c & \\text{if} t \\in [t_0, t_0 + \\alpha] \\\\\nSMax & \\text{if} t \\in [t_0 + \\alpha, t_0 + \\alpha + \\beta] \\\\\n\\frac{SMax (t - t_0 - \\alpha - \\beta)}{-\\gamma} + SMax & \\text{if} t \\in [t_0 + \\alpha + \\beta, t_0 + \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma] \\\\\n0 & \\text{if} t\\ge t_0 + \\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma\n\\end{cases}$\nwhere $t_0$ is the earliest time where the agent was curious about $\\varphi$ and $c = c_B(\\varphi,t_0)$ is the curiosity\nintensity at $t_0$.\nNote that in this definition, the suspense intensity may only vary according to the profile of\nthe agent and the duration. A more refined way to handle this would be to define a decreasing\npersistence of awareness, enabling the agent to forget a variable after some delay, it would be in\naccordance with the common knowledge that the suspense should be revived from time to time.\nConcerning surprise intensity about a formula $\\varphi$, we propose to adopt the point of view of\nShackle [48] as done in [20], by assimilating it to the degree of impossibility of $\\varphi$ (or equivalently\nthe possibility degree of $\\neg \\varphi$). It amounts to finding the most specific rule that is violated by\n$\\varphi \\cup F \\cup B_C$, the more specific this rule, the more surprising $\\varphi$ becomes.\nDefinition 11 (surprise intensity). Given an epistemic state $B = (F, B_L, B_\\Delta = \\Delta_1 ... \\Delta_n)$ where\nthere is a surprise at time $t$, the surprise intensity is $surp_B(\\varphi,t) = n - i$, where $i$ is the most\nspecific strata level, s.t. there is a rule $\\alpha \\leftrightarrow \\beta \\in \\Delta_i$ with $\\{\\varphi \\wedge \\alpha\\} \\cup F \\cup B_L \\models \\neg \\beta$.\nThe definitions of this section are a first step towards being able to compare stories with respect\nto the intensity of emotions they generate in the agent listening to them."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This paper aims at providing a unified framework in which the three emotions at the heart of\nnarrative tension, namely curiosity, surprise, and suspense are formalized and their relationships\nclarified. This framework is built on non-monotonic reasoning for representing compactly the\ndefault behavior of the world and also for simulating the reasoning of an agent in front of a\nstory. The use of non-monotonic reasoning induces a cost in complexity: the detection problems\nassociated with the three emotions are in PNP (due to the use of lexicographic inference). For\neach of the three emotions, we describe methods to evaluate their intensity.\nWhile we illustrated our formalization by adopting the point of view of a single agent in a\nchronological story for the sake of clarity, it does not preclude its adaptability for storytelling\nusing other points of views such as an extradiegetic narrator disclosing knowledge to the listener\nthrough a discourse that does not reflect the timeline of the story.\nTo operationalize this model, we plan to investigate different frameworks that are equipped with\nsolvers namely PDDL planning, Linear logic with Ceptre [35] and propositional default logic with\nTouIST [49]. Moreover, the inherent growing complexity of this problem for scaling to complex\nnarratives requires further study about the granularity of story events, for instance inspired by\ndiscussions about the representation of causality [36]."}]}

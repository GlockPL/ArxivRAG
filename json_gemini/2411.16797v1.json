It informs our approach to combining individual model outputs\nthrough structured consensus formation Woolley et al. [2010]. Additionally, each model's indepen-\ndent processing of questions helps maintain solution diversity and reduces cascading errors Vercam-\nmen et al. [2019].\nThe Distributed Cognition Framework Hutchins [1995] offers theoretical grounding for understand-\ning how cognitive processes can be distributed across multiple artificial agents. This framework\nis particularly relevant because different models may encode complementary aspects of statistical\nknowledge, leading to more comprehensive problem-solving capabilities Du et al. [2024]. Complex\nstatistical reasoning tasks can be decomposed and processed across multiple models, potentially im-\nproving overall solution quality Liu et al. [2024]. Furthermore, the framework helps explain how\ninformation flows between models during collaborative problem-solving Naik [2024].\nMathematical models of consensus formation provide the theoretical basis for understanding how\nagreement emerges among multiple decision-making agents Friedkin [1990]. These models inform\nthe fundamental dynamics of collaborative AI systems through three key aspects: the dynamics of\nagreement, which describe how consensus evolves; weighted influence mechanisms, which define\nthe relative impact of each agent in the consensus process Olfati-Saber et al. [2007]; and the condi-\ntions for convergence that ensure the stability of collaborative solutions Baronchelli [2018]. Recent\nwork by Bahrami et al. [2010] has demonstrated how these theoretical frameworks can be effectively\napplied to multi-agent decision-making systems, offering a robust foundation for understanding col-\nlaborative behavior in artificial intelligence.\nIntegrating collective intelligence, distributed cognition, and consensus formation frameworks pro-\nvides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing collaborative AI systems Hutchins [1995], Woolley\net al. [2010]. This integration can be formally expressed as:\n$R = f (CI, DC, CF)$\nwhere R represents the reliability of collaborative outcomes, integrated across Collective Intelli-\ngence (CI), Distributed Cognition (DC), and Consensus Formation (CF) principles Patrikalakis et al.\n[1999]. Through this unified approach, we can better understand how multiple AI models collabo-\nrate and generate reliable solutions in complex reasoning tasks.\nOur analytical framework synthesizes quantitative and qualitative methods derived from these the-\noretical perspectives Klein et al. [2006]. The quantitative aspects draw from consensus formation\nmodels, providing metrics for measuring agreement and convergence in multi-agent systems Mennis\n[2006]."}, {"title": "1.3 Research Gap", "content": "While existing research has extensively examined individual LLM performance Ahn et al.

Recent advancements in model architectures\nand training approaches have led to increasingly sophisticated systems, such as Claude-3 Anthropic\n[2024] and Gemini Team et al. [2023], which exhibit enhanced reasoning abilities in specialized\ndomains.\nThe concept of collaborative intelligence among AI agents has emerged as a promising approach for\nenhancing problem-solving capabilities Dafoe et al. [2020]. Recent studies have shown that model\ncollaboration can significantly improve reasoning capabilities through cross-model validation Yin\net al. [2023]. Additionally, it enhances robustness, particularly in tackling complex problem-solving\ntasks Sun et al. [2023], Jebellat and Jebellat [2024], Gholami Davoodi et al. [2024], and leads to\nmore reliable outputs by leveraging consensus mechanisms.\nIntegrating collaborative strategies in artificial intelligence (AI) systems has consistently demon-\nstrated enhanced performance across various domains. For instance, Lu et al. [2024] conducted a\ncomprehensive survey highlighting that merging, ensembling, and cooperative approaches among\nLLMs lead to superior outcomes in natural language processing tasks. In the medical field, Rezk\nand Selim [2024] reviewed metaheuristic-based ensemble learning methods, emphasizing their ef-\nfectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Similarly, in mathematical\nproblem-solving, researchers at MIT developed a multi-AI collaboration framework that enhances\nreasoning and factual accuracy in LLMs, resulting in more reliable solutions to complex mathemat-\nical queries MIT News [2023]. In software engineering, ensemble methods have been shown to\nimprove code defect detection and software quality assurance processes Gupta et al. [2022]. These\nfindings collectively highlight the significant advantages of collaborative AI approaches, particularly\nas LLMs continue to evolve and scale.\nThe collaboration of AI models raises critical ethical questions regarding transparency, account-\nability, and bias propagation Bender et al. [2021]. Ensuring that collaborative AI systems operate\nethically is crucial, especially in the absence of ground-truth verification Mittelstadt [2019].\nA primary concern is the potential for bias amplification in collaborative systems. Raghavan et al.\n[2020] demonstrated that model ensembles can compound existing biases, with their study showing\nsignificant increases in gender and demographic biases when multiple models interact. Building\non this work, Hashimoto et al. [2018] established frameworks for measuring and mitigating such\ncumulative biases in machine learning systems.\nTransparency presents another significant challenge in collaborative AI systems. Doshi-Velez et al.\n[2017] identified critical areas, including decision attribution complexity, interpretability of consen-\nsus mechanisms, and accountability frameworks. These challenges become particularly essential in\nhigh-stakes applications, where understanding model decisions is crucial Rudin [2019].\nRecent case studies have highlighted these ethical considerations across various domains. In health-\ncare applications, Larrazabal et al. [2020] examined ethical implications in medical imaging di-\nagnosis, finding that collaborative systems required additional safeguards for patient privacy and\ndecision transparency. Similarly, in educational contexts, Holstein et al. [2019] investigated fairness\nin automated assessment systems, revealing the need to carefully calibrate collaborative systems to\nensure equitable evaluation across diverse student demographics.

Notably, $A$ and $E_{i}$ were\nretained for analysis but withheld from the answering models to replicate real-world conditions\nwhere ground-truth answers are unavailable.\nTo mitigate potential biases, we implemented several strategies. First, topic diversity was ensured\nby including various topics and subtopics, preventing overrepresenting specific areas. Second, the\ncrafted prompts were neutral and avoided introducing leading language or biases, ensuring no influ-\nence on the models' responses in a particular direction.

Both partial and complete agreements are\nconsidered valid, forming the basis for subsequent analyses.\nIn the absence of ground truth labels, we introduced a reliability metric to assess the trustworthiness\nof the consensus answers. Reliability measures the alignment between the consensus response and\nthe answer provided by the LLM that generated the question. Let $ALLM-q$ denote the querying LLM's\nresponse for question $Q_{i}$. The reliability score $R_{i}$ is computed as:\n$R_{i} = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } A_{i}^{cons} = ALLM-q \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}$\nA higher reliability score indicates a more substantial alignment between the consensus answer and\nthe querying LLM's response, increasing confidence in the consensus's validity. This measure is\nprecious in settings where ground truth data is unavailable.\nTo evaluate the robustness of consensus rates across LLMs, we calculated confidence intervals (CIs)\nusing a bootstrap resampling approach. Confidence intervals provide a probabilistic range for the\nactual consensus rate, capturing variability in the observed data. Narrow CIs indicate high reliability,\nwhile wider CIs reflect more significant uncertainty.\nBootstrap resampling enables CI estimation without assumptions about the underlying data distribu-\ntion. Specifically, B bootstrap samples are generated by sampling the original dataset with replace-\nment. The mean agreement rate is computed for each sample, constructing a bootstrap distribution\nof the consensus rate. The a/2-th and 1 - a/2-th percentiles of this distribution define the lower and\nupper CI bounds, respectively. For a 95% CI, these correspond to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.\nBy incorporating confidence intervals, we mitigate uncertainty in agreement rates and establish\na statistical basis for comparing LLMs. Overlapping CIs suggest no significant differences be-\ntween models, whereas non-overlapping intervals indicate statistically significant differences. This\nmethodology ensures a robust and interpretable evaluation of model reliability, mainly when ground\ntruth labels are unavailable.\nTo further validate reliability and assess statistical significance, we employed the following addi-\ntional statistical measures:\nChi-Square Test of Independence A chi-square test was used to evaluate whether the distribution\nof selected answers deviated significantly from random chance. The test statistic was calculated as:\n$\\chi^{2} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{(O_{k} - E_{k})^{2}}{E_{k}}$\nWhere:\n\u2022 $O_{k}$ is the observed frequency of answer choice k across all models and questions.\n\u2022 $E_{k}$ is the expected frequency of answer choice k, assuming uniform random selection,\n$E_{k} = \\frac{Nxnj}{K}$\n\u2022 K = 4 is the number of answer choices.\n\u2022 N is the total number of questions.\n\u2022$N_{j}$ = 3 is the number of answering models.\nTo determine statistical significance, the computed $x^{2}$ value was compared against the chi-square\ndistribution with K - 1 degrees of freedom.\nFleiss' Kappa Coefficient Fleiss' kappa\u043a was employed to quantify the agreement among the\nmodels beyond chance. It is defined as:\n$\\kappa = \\frac{\\overline{P} - \\overline{P_{e}}}{1 - \\overline{P_{e}}}$\nWhere:\n\u2022$\\overline{P}$ is the mean observed agreement among the models.\n\u2022$\\overline{P_{e}}$ is the mean agreement expected by chance.\nThe value of k ranges from -1 (perfect disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement), with 0 indicating no\nagreement beyond chance.\nThese mechanisms collectively ensured a robust framework for validating model responses and as-\nsessing the reliability of the generated consensus."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "We assessed the level of agreement among the models-GPT-4, LLaMA, Gemini, and Claude-for\neach generated question.

We quantified inter-model agreement us-\ning consensus-based validation and confidence interval analysis and identified distinct strengths and\nweaknesses. Claude and GPT-4 emerged as the most reliable collaborators, achieving reliability\npercentages of 92% and 90%, respectively, with narrow confidence intervals (Claude: 0.80-0.93,\nGPT-4: 0.75-0.90), indicating high precision and consistency.

The statistical signifi-\ncance of these results, indicated by a very small p-value, confirms that the observed inter-model\nagreement is not due to random chance, reinforcing the robustness of the consensus mechanism in\nidentifying trustworthy responses.\nThese findings prove that collaborative interactions among large language models (LLMs) can im-\nprove response reliability through consensus mechanisms. The study highlights the potential of these\nmethodologies for applications in AI-driven education, automated validation systems, and collabo-\nrative AI frameworks. For example, leveraging highly reliable models such as Claude and GPT-4 in\ncooperative settings could enhance the accuracy and trustworthiness of AI-generated responses in\nhigh-stakes domains.\nFuture research should explore integrating models with diverse architectures and training datasets to\nmitigate the risk of correlated errors and investigate the impact of model heterogeneity on consensus\nrates. Further analysis of bias propagation is also critical to ensure collaborative systems do not\ninadvertently reinforce shared misconceptions among models. Addressing these directions will sig-\nnificantly improve consensus-based validation frameworks' robustness, scalability, and reliability,\nlaying the groundwork for more effective and trustworthy AI systems."}]}

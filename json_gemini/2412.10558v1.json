These models leverage two primary sources of information during inference: the static, encoded knowledge stored within their weights\u2014referred to as their world model (LeCun, 2022)\u2014and the dynamic, in-context information presented in the prompt.\n\nThe internal world model of an LLM captures the extensive knowledge acquired from pretraining on vast amounts of data and subsequent fine-tuning. This knowledge enables the model to understand, reason, and generate contextually relevant responses. We hypothesize that larger models, with more parameters, develop more robust world models, allowing them to better integrate and validate new information. In contrast, in-context information can include arbitrary content, ranging from legitimate user requests to unreliable or malicious information intended to deceive the model and undermine its reasoning.\n\nThis work studies how LLMs of varying capacities within the same model family balance in-context information against their internal world models during inference. We focus in particular on the open-source models Llama (Meta, 2024), Gemma (Google, 2024), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2024), and Phi (Microsoft, 2024) to isolate the impact of model size and architecture (a task not feasible with proprietary models). By injecting intentionally misleading information into the prompts, we observe how these models process and respond to deceptive inputs, measuring how it affects their performance on popular multiple-choice benchmarks. This methodology allows us to assess the resilience of the models' world knowledge against misinformation and deceitful content.\n\nOur main finding is that larger language models exhibit greater resilience to deception, maintaining higher relative performance when faced with misleading information at inference time compared to their smaller counterparts. This result prompts us to revisit our initial hypothesis that larger models develop more robust world models. Conversely, smaller models tend to rely excessively on the provided in-context information and are more susceptible to misinformed"}, {"title": null, "content": "and deceptive cues, even when these contradict their internal knowledge, making them more vulnerable to manipulation and malicious attacks.\n\nTo support this key finding, we conduct additional control experiments to rule out alternative explanations.

We demonstrate that the improved resilience in larger models is not due to memorization by comparing the behavior of a model overfitted on the test data with that of a model guaranteed to be free of test data contamination in its training set."}, {"title": "BACKGROUND", "content": "The concept of \u201cstochastic parrots\u201d was introduced by Bender et al. (2021) as a pessimistic view of the stored knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that these models might merely regurgitate training data without true understanding. Similarly, Schaeffer et al. (2023) argue that emergent capabilities in LLMs may be a mirage caused by steadily increasing model capacities. However, LLMs have demonstrated abilities in reasoning and planning (Hao et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023), which can be considered evidence of a black-box world model in a behaviorist sense, as elaborated in Appendix F. In this context, a world model (LeCun, 2022) refers to an internal representation that holistically grasps concepts, akin to human understanding, enabling more robust behavior. Additionally, Del\u00e9tang et al. (2024) demonstrate that LLMs act as effective compressors, indicating that their capabilities extend beyond mere memorization.\n\nResearch on world models in foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2022) often focuses on multi-modal contexts (Assran et al., 2023; Bardes et al., 2024; Garrido et al., 2024). From a benchmarking perspective, GQA (Ainslie et al., 2023) and OpenEQA (Majumdar et al., 2024) assess models' abilities to reason over complex environments in multi-modal settings. Notably, the concept of a world model is less explored and more vaguely defined in language models compared to model-based reinforcement learning, where the world model is a central component (Sutton, 1990; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Hafner et al., 2019).\n\nIn this work, we are interested in exploring the robustness of the world model in a purely language-based context by altering the evaluation methodologies of existing benchmarks. The impact of methodological changes on model performance has been highlighted by Alzahrani et al. (2024), who demonstrate the vulnerability of LLM leaderboards. Several studies (Wang et al., 2024b; Wei et al., 2024; Zong et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Gupta et al., 2024) have shown that minor changes in evaluation, such as reordering multiple-choice answers, can significantly affect model performance. Additionally, Lyu et al. (2024) argue that the commonly used log-likelihood evaluation for multiple-choice tasks may not correlate well with human perceived performance.\n\nWe see these vulnerabilities in evaluation methodologies as indicators of incoherence or flaws in LLMs' world models. Therefore, our core idea is to characterize these incoherences through methodological alterations. This approach differs from works like MMLU-Redux (Gema et al., 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024c), which focus on methodological and data improvements to the original MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY", "content": "To assess the sensitivity of language models to in-context cues, we evaluate how additional prompt information affects their performance on a collection of popular multiple-choice question-answering benchmarks.

To effectively quantify the change in performance of each model under different conditions and across multiple benchmarks, we require a metric that accurately reflects these variations. A natural candidate is the Accuracy Drop, defined as the difference between the original performance and the performance under ablation (Accuracy Drop = Original Accuracy - Altered Accuracy). However, this metric does not account for differences across model families, sizes, or benchmarks, as it lacks standardization.\n\nFor example, consider a model A that experiences a 5% Accuracy Drop under a specific ablation, going from 80% to 75%. If another model, B, also exhibits a 5% Accuracy Drop but from a significantly lower original performance, say from 60% to 55%, the absolute Accuracy Drop does not capture the relative importance of the drop on each model and benchmark. The performance change should be perceived differently between A and B, but the absolute Accuracy Drop fails to reflect this discrepancy.\n\nTo address this issue, we employ the Relative Accuracy Drop, calculated as the Accuracy Drop divided by the Original Accuracy. In our previous example, for the same Absolute Accuracy Drop of 5% for models A and B, their Relative Accuracy Drop would be 6.25% and 8.33% respectively.

We hypothesize that while all models will exhibit some degree of performance decline due to the misleading hint, the extent of this drop will vary with model size. Specifically, smaller models are expected to follow the incorrect hint more often, resulting in a larger Relative Accuracy Drop.

Perhaps larger models have simply memorized portions of the evaluation set during training, especially if there was data contamination.\n\nTo investigate this possibility, we design a third control experiment using the MMLU dataset. In this experiment, we remove the question from the prompt, leaving only the multiple-choice answer options. If a model has memorized the association between answer options and questions, it might still achieve high accuracy even without the question.\n\nRemarkably, as depicted in Figure 4, the accuracy of almost all models remains well above the chance level (25%) even in the absence of the question. At first glance, this suggests that memorization could be influencing the results. Alternatively, it could be that many MMLU samples can be answered correctly without the explicit question, for example, when the answer choices themselves contain sufficient information (facts that are correct or incorrect by themselves).\n\nTo push our examination further, we perform an additional experiment with two models: (1) DCLM-7B (Li et al., 2024a), a language model guaranteed to have had no prior exposure to MMLU; and (2) an overfitted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model explicitly trained on the MMLU evaluation set to mimic severe data contamination (details of overfitting is provided in Appendix B). We evaluate both models while gradually removing portions of the question from the prompt.\n\nIf memorization was the primary factor, we would expect the \"contaminated\" model to maintain high accuracy even without the question, while the DCLM-7B model's performance should drop to chance level. Contrary to this expectation, both models maintain accuracy above chance level even when the question is completely removed, as shown in Figure 5. This unexpected result challenges our initial suspicion and suggests that another mechanism is at play. For instance, while the explicit question was removed in this scenario, implicit information remained within the answer choices (as MMLU prompts contain answer choices, allowing models to reason across"}, {"title": null, "content": "these options). Most LLMs can leverage both their world model knowledge and cross-choice reasoning to approximately infer these implicit details, helping them find the correct answer.\n\nAnalysis These observations suggest that LLMs can handle missing information in prompts, performing effectively even when key components are omitted. While we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that memorization contributes to the observed resilience, our findings show that the models' ability to infer missing details is not simply a byproduct of memorization. This supports our original hypothesis: larger models are more resilient to deceptive in-context information not because they have memorized the answers, but because they can effectively reconcile conflicting information, potentially leveraging their internal representations learned during training."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we introduced a powerful and straightforward evaluation strategy that re-uses existing benchmarks with minimal changes, enabling us to empirically gain new perspectives on the behavior of LLMs. Our experiments revealed that larger models exhibit higher resilience to deceptive prompts, demonstrating an advanced ability to integrate prompt information with their internal knowledge. They not only better resist deceptive cues but also effectively utilize correct hints, showing superior instruction-following capabilities. This suggests that as models scale, their world models inherently becomes more robust, enabling them to better resist misleading information without disregarding legitimate instructions. Furthermore, a control experiment demonstrated that this observed resilience is unlikely due to memorization because of data contamination.\n\nTo our knowledge, this study provides the first empirical evidence linking LLM capacity to resilience against misinformation. Despite these insights, our study has limitations. First, we focused exclusively on multiple-choice datasets. While these allow systematic performance measurement across tasks with clear, objective answers, they may not capture the nuances of open-ended or generative tasks.

Some researchers (Bender & Koller, 2020; Bisk et al., 2020) posit that LLMs primarily learn an extensive collection of statistical correlations from their training data without forming a coherent or interpretable understanding of the data-generating processes. In this view, LLMs function as sophisticated pattern matchers that excel at predicting the next word based on learned associations but lack deeper comprehension.\n\u2022 LLMs form an internal world model. In contrast, other studies (Gurnee & Tegmark, 2024; Li et al., 2024b; Nanda et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Patel & Pavlick, 2022; LeCun, 2022) suggest that LLMs, through the compression of vast amounts of training data, develop compact, coherent, and interpretable models of the generative processes underlying the data essentially forming an internal world model. This model enables the agent to assess the probability of different elements and concepts, determining what is more likely, plausible, or less probable within a given context (LeCun, 2022).\nFor instance, Gurnee & Tegmark (2024) demonstrated that LLMs can learn linear representations of spatial and temporal concepts, indicating that they encode structured knowledge about space and time within their internal representations. Another study (Li et al., 2024b) showed that transformers trained on next-token prediction for the game Othello develop explicit internal representations of the game state. Furthermore, Nanda et al. (2023) revealed that these representations are linear and interpretable, suggesting that the models internally capture the game's rules and state transitions.\n\nThis paper is grounded in the latter hypothesis: we propose that LLMs build internal world models that extend beyond surface-level statistical patterns."}]}

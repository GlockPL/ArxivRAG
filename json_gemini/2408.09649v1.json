Machine\nlearning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing mo-\ntor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study\nconverts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D\nplots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The\nmotor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points\nwith five classes one healthy and four synthetically-applied\nmotor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions \u2013 0, 25,\n50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on\nthe dataset \u2013 non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and\noverlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep\nlearning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from\ngenerated plots of each method.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Machine fault detection is crucial in industrial settings.\nPrompt and accurate detection of machine faults can signifi-\ncantly reduce downtime in production processes, enabling fast\nresponses that prevent further delays and operational inter-\nruptions. Artificial intelligence has been effectively utilized in\nthis domain due to its proficiency in pattern recognition and\npredictive analysis without explicit programming. The studies\nof [1] and [2] reviewed the role of machine learning (ML),\ndeep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL) in identifying\nfaults in motors. Recently, [3], [4] and [5] proposed a novel\nmethod of transforming time-series motor current signals into\n2D occurrence and recurrence plots, respectively, and then\ndeveloped DL models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to classify faults with satisfying 82.80% accuracy.\nHowever, one of the conventional ML methods using a 1D\nfrequency-transformed dataset still outperformed these with a\ngood accuracy of 93.20% [6]. There's still a search for better\nmethods, and 2D image-based transformation seems to have\ngood potential.\nIn generating 2D image plots, short-time Fourier Transform\n(STFT) is widely used in understanding frequency over time\nwith which a typical 1D Fourier transform cannot perform.\nSTFT may expose underlying patterns with the changes in\nfrequency over time. This method has effectively captured\ntransient and non-stationary characteristics typical of motor\nfaults [7], [8]. CNNs are adept at recognizing spatial hier-\narchies in data, which enhances their utility in image-based\nanalysis in machine fault detection [9]\u2013[12].\nThis study explores short-time Fourier transform (STFT)\nand its variants, transforming the motor current signal dataset\ninto 2D time-frequency plots and developing CNN models to\nclassify motor faults. It benchmarks and compares previous\nstudies [3], [4], [13] using the same motor dataset and CNN\narchitecture and model development.

SHORT-TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM AND ITS\nVARIANTS", "content": "The Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is a widely-\nused time-frequency analysis of signals. The mathematical\nexpression for STFT is given by (1).\n$STFT{x(t)}(t,w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(\\tau)w(\\tau - t)e^{-jw\\tau}d\\tau$   (1)\nwhere $w(\\tau - t)$ denotes the window function centered at time\nt, and w represents the angular frequency. This framework\nenables simultaneous examination of signal characteristics in\nboth time and frequency domains by sliding the window w\nacross the signal and computing the Fourier transform of\nthe windowed signal at each position [14]\u2013[16]. The window\ncan overlap signals, thus refining the resolution of the time-\nfrequency plot but compromising some inherent properties and\nincreasing computation power.\nVariations of the STFT, such as the realigned STFT and\nthe synchrosqueezed STFT, offer refined time-frequency rep-\nresentations to overcome certain limitations of the basic STFT\napproach. Realigned STFT adjusts the STFT framework to\nenhance the localization of signal energy within the time-\nfrequency (TF) plane, thus improving component visibility\n17\u2013[19]. On the other hand, synchrosqueezed STFT refines\nthe analysis by reassigning the energy from each TF bin to\nlocations determined by the instantaneous frequency of the\nsignal [20], [20]. This study uses five STFT methods: non-\noverlapping STFT and realigned-STFT, overlapping STFT and\nrealigned-STFT, and synchrosqueezed STFT. The resulting\nsample 2D TF plots of the motor dataset under five fault and\nfull-load conditions generated by these five STFT methods can\nbe contrasted in Fig. 1. Overlapping STFTs show more refined\nSTFT plots. In contrast, synchrosqueezed STFTs tend to\noversimplify the transformation, making it difficult to contrast\namong the classes."}, {"title": "IV.

This CNN model starts by inputting three color images\nextracted from each set of STFT methods. In addition to the\nmodel, the training and testing steps, such as 10-fold cross-\nvalidation, are reproduced from [3] to allow comparison of\nresults."}, {"title": "V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Five CNN models were developed, trained, and validated.\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the converging accuracy and loss function\nperformances, respectively. The CNN architecture seems to\nwork well with all five STFT-based datasets except with the\nsynchrosqueezed STFT method, which struggled to converge.\nThe performances are even more evident with the 10-fold\nstratified cross-validation performance as shown in Fig. 5\nwhere synchrosqueezed-STFT showed inconsistent and vary-\ning performances with only 88.27% average accuracy after ten\nfolds. On the other hand, the overlap STFT method showed\nthe best average performance of 97.65 % with the slightest\nperformance variation, while the rest show greater than 95%\naverage accuracy performances with satisfactory performance\nvariations.\nSummarizing and comparing the previous results of [3], [4],\n[6], [13] in Table I using the same configurations, four methods\noutperformed the best ML method while all five outperformed\nprevious 2D-plot based methods of the accuracy of 80.25,\n74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same\nDL architecture, and validation steps.\nThe confusion matrices of the previous best ML model,\nLightGBM, and the best model of each STFT method are\nshown in Fig. 6. Accordingly, the best-performing STFT\nmethod, the overlap STFT method, showed perfect classifi-\ncation accuracy when classifying healthy motors, bearing axis\nmisalignment, and stator inter-turn short circuit faults while\nbeing almost perfect when classifying outer bearing defects.\nUnlike LightGBM, the confusion between broken rotor strips\nand outer bearing defects is more minor. The other methods,\nexcept the synchrosqueezed STFT, showed comparable or\nbetter results than LightGBM."}, {"title": "VI.

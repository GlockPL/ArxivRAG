The smallest unit of the causal domain knowledge is known as a causal relationship. The causal relationship is a connection between two or more events or variables where one event or variable is the cause of the other. Causal domain knowledge is commonly documented either in unstructured or semi structured forms. Tabular formatted documents, typically utilized in the Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), serve as a prime example of semi structured documents. Furthermore, much causal domain knowledge is also found in presentation slides, which are documents that do not follow a predefined structure, and are typically used in industry for sharing information between the different teams and with customers.\nIn FMEA documents, the manually created textual content presents several chal-lenges such as non-standardized descriptions of the failure modes, effects, and root causes, and in many cases merged cells. In the case of merged cells, the description of multiple events within a single FMEA table cell (Razouk and Kern, 2022), which can involve enchained relations. In an enchained causal relation, a cause or an effect in a causal relation is the cause or the effect of another causal relation. This creates a com-plex network of interconnected events where each cause and effect is both influenced by and influences other events in the chain.\nFurthermore, the increasing use of digital presentation slides as a medium for presenting and sharing information has made them a valuable source of knowl-edge (Hayama et al., 2008). Presentation slides stemming from processes like failure analysis requests encapsulate documented causal relations. These relations shed light on failures detected in products, providing a comprehensive understanding of the fac-tors contributing to such issues. However, the unstructured nature of presentation slides, which combine visual and textual elements and use spatial positioning to doc-ument information, can make automated information access difficult. While these features are useful for presenting information to a live audience, they can make it dif-ficult for automated systems to extract and understand the information contained in the slides.\nPresentation slides and FMEA documents are a rich source of causal domain knowl-edge. However, the sheer volume of documents in the industry can make it difficult to manually process and extract the information contained within them. This can"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The extraction of causal information from documents is a widely discussed topic across various domains such as the medical, financial, and industrial sectors. The importance of extracting causal information lies in its various applications, which are summarized in Section 2.1. Scholars have been actively developing different methods to extract causal information from documents due to the high demand for this task. These methods can be broadly categorized into two groups: knowledge-based meth-ods and data-driven methods. Section 2.2 provides a summary of these methods and their respective approaches. Overall, the extraction of causal information is a critical task that has numerous applications across various domains, and researchers continue to develop innovative approaches for its efficient extraction."}, {"title": "2.1 Causal information extraction applications", "content": "Causal information extraction plays a crucial role in diverse sectors. The interest in this topic is especially high in the health (Richie et al., 2022), finance (Saha et al., 2022) and industrial (Razouk et al., 2023) sector. Causal information extraction in the health sec-tor is essential for advancing medical knowledge (Reklos and Mero\u00f1o-Pe\u00f1uela, 2022), improving patient care (Seol et al., 2014), supporting research endeavors (Negi et al., 2019), and enhancing overall healthcare outcomes. It plays a critical role in various aspects of healthcare, from disease understanding and diagnosis to treatment personal-ization, drug discovery, and public health management. Causal information extraction in finance can enhance risk management (Aerts and Zhang, 2014), market analysis (Nam and Seong, 2019), fraud detection (Kong et al.), portfolio optimization (Tang et al., 2019; Ravivanpong et al., 2022), regulatory compliance (Ravivanpong et al., 2022), policy development, and scenario analysis. Causal information empowers finan-cial professionals with valuable insights, assisting them in navigating the complexities of the financial landscape. Extensive research in this field has been conducted as part of the shared task FinCausal 2022 (Mariko et al., 2022).\nIn industrial settings, ontologies are commonly employed to create a knowledge base and facilitate the sharing of knowledge in a structured manner. As shown in (Safont-Andreu et al., 2021), they can also be used to structure causal domain knowl-edge. However, ontological approaches often encounter challenges related to high maintenance requirements and limited scalability. To address these issues, considerable effort has been invested in automatically enriching tabular formats with additional information derived from domain knowledge. Razouk and Kern (Razouk and Kern, 2022) present approaches that use statistical pattern-based methods combined with lexical patterns to detect cases of merged cells, aiming to enhance the consistency of these documents. Furthermore, in the realm of risk assessment documents, such as FMEA documents, causal domain knowledge has been extracted and structured into a knowledge graph (Razouk et al., 2023). This knowledge graph has been ingeniously employed to develop a method for knowledge discovery, drawing from common sense knowledge completion techniques"}, {"title": "2.2 Causal information extraction methods", "content": "The extraction of causal information from documents is a topic of great interest since not only numerical data but also texts can give valuable insight into causal rela-tions (Yuan et al., 2023). While causal discovery aims to uncover the causal model or, at the very least, a Markov equivalent that mimics the data generation process for a given data set (Glymour et al., 2019), causal information extraction from texts focuses on identifying causal entities and how they are connected to each other (Yang et al., 2022). The current existing methods for causal information extraction are broadly categorized by (Yang et al., 2022) into three main categories:\n1. Pattern-based approaches\n2. Statistical machine learning-based approaches\n3. Deep learning approaches\nPattern-based approaches usually leverage linguistic patterns to identify causal language in limited contexts. For instance, (Girju, 2003) use lexical and syntac-tic patterns to detect causal relations in medical and business texts. Pattern-based approaches can be effective for specific domains but they lack generalizability. Statis-tical machine learning-based approaches typically involve the use of third-party NLP tools which require fewer patterns than pattern-based approaches (Wu et al., 2012). Deep learning approaches leverage deep neural networks to extract causal information from text (Akkasi and Moens, 2021) and to acquire useful vectorized representations of text (G\u00e4rber, 2022; Saha et al., 2022; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2023). This involves training neural networks to identify causal relationships in text using techniques such as supervised learning. As such, many scholars have been working on creating anno-tation guidelines (Dunietz et al., 2015, 2017; Mariko et al., 2020) and annotating data sets for training and testing the developed methods (Mariko et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022).\nOne of the most common machine learning and deep learning approaches for extracting causal information is the use of sequence tagging. As causal information extraction is not only about identifying causes and effects, but about detecting them as pairs, to obtain useful causal information, the relation between the entities needs to be taken into consideration (Yang et al., 2022). Pure sequence tagging methods, such as the method presented in (Saha et al., 2022; Khetan et al., 2020), are facing difficul-ties in integrating relational information into the input data while performing Named Entity Recognition (NER). Since the relation between the entities is crucial in order to obtain useful causal knowledge, other approaches have been proposed which involve fine-tuning pre-trained language models for text span classification and sequence label-ing tasks. For example, the authors in (Saha et al., 2022) specifically label the text spans corresponding to cause and effect in a given text. They then proceed to classify whether these identified cause and effect spans were linked together through a causal relation. Similarly, (Khetan et al., 2020) employ an event-aware language model in order to predict causal relations by taking into account event information, sentence context and masked event context. Another major difficulty in the extraction of causal-ity using NER is the recognition of overlapping and nested entities. (Lee et al., 2022)"}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "Causal domain knowledge is typically documented either in unstructured or semi struc-tured documents. These documents are by design aimed to be produced and consumed by human domain experts. Thus, this documentation style impedes a straight forward automated information access. The objective of this study is to develop a method that can increase the usability of the causal domain knowledge contained in a set of industrial documents by transforming the information into a more structured format. To achieve this objective, we propose a causal information extraction method from various industrial documents, depicted in Figure 1, that involves the following steps:\n1. Text extraction from different documents formats: this step involves extracting a textual representation of the information contained in the different documents. This textual representation can be analyzed and used to develop causal information extraction methods. This step is elaborated in Section 3.1.\n2. Structured Data Representation: This step involves representing the information contained in texts extracted from different industrial documents in a structured format (i.e. a set of named entities and relations between these entities) that can be easily used for downstream tasks such as risk assessment, data analysis, etc. This step is outlined in Section 3.2.\n3. Automated causal information extraction from text: This step involves extract-ing meaningful vectorized text representation. Leveraging this representation to develop causal information extraction methods that transfer the information con-tained in the text to a set of named entities and relations between these entities. Namely, we propose two approaches: the first one based on a single stage sequence tagging (SST), the second one is based on multi stage sequence tagging (MST). This step is elaborated in Section 3.3."}, {"title": "3.1 Text extraction from different documents formats", "content": "Our method focuses on two types of industrial documents: semi structured documents represented by FMEA documents, and unstructured documents represented by pre-sentation slides. For semi structured documents, our method parses the documents as tabular formats and extracts the text contained in the failure mode, effect, and cause columns. Each cell of these columns represents a separate entity and is treated as a standalone text. This approach has also been proposed by Razouk et al. in their work on FMEA documents (Razouk and Kern, 2022; Razouk et al., 2023). By extracting causal information from FMEA text, merged cells which contain causal relations can be split into multiple cells and merged into the existing knowledge graph. Thus, a more connected knowledge graph can be achieved."}, {"title": "3.2 Structured data representation of causal information", "content": "Structured data representation is a crucial part of information extraction. In particu-lar, representing causal relationships in a structured manner have received significant attention in recent years due to their importance in understanding the connections between different events, phenomena, and concepts. There are several ways to repre-sent structured data in the context of causal relationships. One common approach is to use knowledge graphs to represent the relationships between different entities. In these graphs, each entity is represented as a node, and the causal relationships between entities are represented as edges. For example, a knowledge graph could represent the causal relationships between different failure modes and their causes and effects in the FMEA documents (Razouk et al., 2023).\nHowever, information extraction for causal relations is challenging due to several reasons. Causal relations are often part of our cognitive reasoning and can be artic-ulated implicitly in text, making it difficult for automated systems to identify them accurately. Additionally, cognitive reasoning can differ from person to person, which can create disagreement in the interpretation of the same text. To mitigate these challenges, several scholars have proposed different annotation guidelines to guide annotators in the annotation process (Dunietz et al., 2015, 2017; Mariko et al., 2020; Khetan et al., 2021). Specifically, many scholars have recommended only extracting explicit causal relations (Dunietz et al., 2015). In our structured data representation, we have adapted these recommendations by specifying three entity types: cause, effect, and trigger. The cause and effect entities represent events or variables articulated in the text, while the trigger is the explicit causal clue that expresses the presence of the causal relation between the cause and the effect. To fully represent a causal relation, three types of entities - cause, trigger, and effect - and two relations between them are used. The first relation connects the cause and the trigger, while the second relation connects the trigger and the effect. This approach helps to accurately capture explicit causal relations in texts and can be useful in various applications such as information retrieval and knowledge representation.\nAnnotation guidelines are crucial for creating consistent training and testing data, particularly for data-driven methods. They facilitate the consistency required for effec-tive training and evaluation of such methods. However, these guidelines may have limited applicability to domain-specific texts, such as those from the semiconductor industry, due to their unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we have"}, {"title": "3.3 Automated causal information extraction from text", "content": "The proposed approach utilizes BERT-based language models to extract meaningful vectorized text representations, specifically selected for their relevance to the domain. To potentially further optimize these models, in-domain fine-tuning using masked lan-guage modeling objective is conducted on a data set from the same domain. During the fine-tuning, we compare two masking objectives. The first objective involves uni-form masking (UM), where the masked tokens are selected randomly across the text. The second objective leverages point-wise mutual information masking (PMI) (Levine et al., 2020), where spans of tokens related to each other based on their co-occurrence are masked. This approach could potentially help to improve the relevance of the extracted vectorized text representations for the specific domain. Hence, by selecting and fine-tuning BERT-based models, we could effectively capture the nuances and complexities of the domain-specific language and improve the overall performance\nTo transfer the information contained in text, two causal information extraction methods are selected. The first approach is based on single-stage sequence tagging (SST) using BERT token embeddings, originally designed for named entity recogni-tion. Specifically, the proposed SST approach extracts the token embeddings from the text, and passes them to a multi-label classifier, which allows for detecting overlap-ping labels, meaning a token can be recognized as a cause and an effect at the same time. The losses of the classifier are used to update both the classifier weights and the language model weights. This approach is depicted in left side of Figure 2.\nThe second approach is based on a multi-stage sequence tagging (MST) method, firstly presented in (G\u00e4rber, 2022). This approach consists of multiple cascaded mod-els, that utilize the text embeddings given by a BERT model. The first model is a binary token classifier that detects tokens with a trigger label. The output of this model is passed to a second model that identifies tokens belonging to the same trigger entity. This is achieved using a trigger grouping model that performs binary classifica-tion to determine whether two token embeddings with predicted trigger labels belong to the same trigger entity.\nThis model allows the method to detect disrupted entities which could be the case for the trigger. Disrupted entities refer to entities that have been interrupted by the occurrence of another entity within its text span. In the sentence, \"The root cause for back side defect are humidity residues\u201d, the trigger is made up of the tokens\" The root cause for\" and \"are\". However, this trigger is disrupted by the effect, which is represented by the tokens\" back side defect\" .\nIn the next step, the embeddings of the tokens belonging to the same trigger entity are aggregated together using an attention network. The aggregated combined trigger embeddings are devised by a third model to detect the arguments (i.e., tokens belonging to the cause and effect of that trigger). Specifically, the model concatenates the embeddings of the tokens and the combined trigger embeddings and devices them as an input to a multi-class calcification to detect the cause and effect for a given"}, {"title": "3.4 Evaluation Methodology", "content": "To evaluate the performance of our proposed pipeline for causal information extrac-tion in the semiconductor industry, a set of evaluation techniques is devised. These techniques are detailed as follows. To assess the clarity and effectiveness of the struc-tured data representation of causal information, the consistency of annotations among multiple annotators is evaluated. This metric can help predict potential limitations in the clarity of the annotations guidelines that could propagate to the automated causal information extraction methods. To estimate the inter-annotator agreement (IAA), the token-based Cohen's k and F1 score are calculated. While the performance of the method is not bound by the IAA (Richie et al., 2022), the IAA can set or limit expec-tations and indicate which aspects might be particularly challenging for the model to learn. In addition, we executed a performance evaluation of each component of the MST pipeline, including trigger detection, trigger grouping, and cause and effect detection. For each component, the F1 score is calculated, and the results between the two approaches (i.e. SST and MST) are compared."}, {"title": "4 Experiments and Results", "content": "In pursuit of our research objectives, we collected a data set containing two types of industrial documents from an actual semiconductor manufacturing company.

Therefore, it is limited to the extraction of textualized causal relations in presentation slides and cannot process causal information expressed through visual elements like arrows, color encoding, etc. This limitation is of high relevance as presentation slides are created to be viewed and not be simply read, since a great amount of their information is in visualized form.

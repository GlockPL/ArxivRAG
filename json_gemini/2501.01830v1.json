However, most ex-\nisting methods focus on isolated safety flaws,\nlimiting their ability to adapt to dynamic de-\nfenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities ef-\nficiently. To address this challenge, we propose\nAUTO-RT, a reinforcement learning framework\nthat automatically explores and optimizes com-\nplex attack strategies to effectively uncover se-\ncurity vulnerabilities through malicious queries.\nSpecifically, we introduce two key mechanisms\nto reduce exploration complexity and improve\nstrategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Explo-\nration, which accelerate exploration by focusing\non high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progres-\nsive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate\ndowngrade models, which dynamically refine the\nsearch trajectory toward successful vulnerability\nexploitation. Extensive experiments across di-\nverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly im-\nproving exploration efficiency and automatically\noptimizing attack strategies, AUTO-RT detects a\nboarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster\ndetection speed and 16.63% higher success rates\ncompared to existing methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Preliminary: Red-Teaming Aligned LLMs", "content": "The goal of automatic red-teaming is to generate attack\nprompts using attack model AM to challenge target model\nTM. The success of this process is evaluated based on the\nharmfulness of the responses y produced by TM when re-\nacting to an attack prompt x generated by AM tailored for\nvarious toxic behaviors T. The harmfulness of the responses\nis quantified using a safety evaluation function R(x, y).\nIn addition, during the optimization process of AM, it is\ncommon practice to augment the optimization objective\nwith some additional constraint terms (Achiam et al., 2017;\nMoskovitz et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024),\nsuch as those that encourage the attack generation to stay\nclose to natural language, ensure that the target generation\naligns with the attack goal, and promote diversity in the\nattack generation. These constraints can be collectively\nrepresented as f_i(x, y, t) \\leq c_i.\nFormally, the optimization objective of automatic red-\nteaming can be expressed as:\n$\\arg \\max_{\\text{AM}} E[R(x, y)], \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad f_i(x, y, t) \\leq c_i$\\nwhere $x \\sim AM(t)$, $y \\sim TM(x)$, $t \\in T$ (1)\nWhen performing red-teaming with a focus on discovering\nhigh-exploitability vulnerabilities, which we called strate-\ngic red-teaming, the attack model can be further decom-\nposed into two components: a strategy generation model\nAMg responsible for generating attack strategies s and a\nstrategy-based attack rephrasing model AM, which utilizes\nthe generated strategies to produce specific attack prompts\nx. This process can be represented as $x \\sim AM_r(s,t)$,\nwhere $s \\sim AM_g$, and $t \\in T$, therefore, Equation 1 can be\nreformulated as:"}, {"title": "2. Auto Red-Teaming", "content": "In this section, we present our framework for automatic\nstrategic red-teaming: AUTO-RT. We incorporate early\ntermination into the MDP framework to enable the attack\nmodel to focus on exploring high-severity vulnerabilities\nwhile promptly halting ineffective explorations. Addition-\nally, we leverage the degraded target model to perform re-\nward shaping on the original safety signals, providing denser\nfeedback signals to enhance the efficiency of exploration\nand exploitation.. We illustrate the schematic of our pro-\nposed framework in Figure. 2.\nProblems RL algorithms are known to struggle when re-\nward signals are sparse (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019; Rengara-\njan et al., 2022). Our experiments also show that directly\noptimizing using Equation 2 requires extensive exploration\nto find effective attack prompts, and as the target model's\nsafety capabilities improve, finding effective attack prompts\nbecomes increasingly difficult. We believe this issue is due\nto the following two factors:\ni). As the target model's safety alignment improves, feed-\nback signals from extensive exploration are mostly\nclassified as safe. This results in the safety reward com-\nponent lacking effective optimization guidance over\ntime, causing the model to shift its exploration focus\nto other constraint terms, thereby deviating from the\nobjective of red teaming.\nii). Compared to optimization targeting a specific attack\ngoal, the reward signal for strategic red-teaming is even\nsparser. Additionally, when attacking a specific target,\ndifferent attack prompts tend to have some correla-\ntion, whereas in strategic red-teaming, various attack\nstrategies show low similarity. These factors require\nthe model to have stronger exploration capabilities to\nachieve effective red-teaming results.\nOur Approach To address issue (i), we propose\nEarly-terminated Exploration which integrates the early-\nterminated Markov Decision Process (ET-MDP) frame-\nwork (Sun et al., 2021) into the Constrained MDP problem\nformulation in Equation 2. This approach introduces desig-\nnated checkpoints within the MDP to evaluate compliance\nwith predefined constraints. If a constraint is violated, the\nexploration process is immediately terminated, and a penalty\nsignal is relayed to the AM. Safety evaluations of the target\nmodel's responses are conducted exclusively when all con-\nstraints are satisfied, only the corresponding safety signals\nare generated and returned, without further consideration of"}, {"title": "4. Main Results", "content": "Attack Effectiveness and Diversity Table 1 presents the\nresults of our AUTO-RT and other baselines in white-box\nevaluation, where a degraded model can be obtained by per-\nforming toxic fine-tuning on the target model. We identify\nthe most effective attack strategies through training on Ttrn\nand evaluate these strategies based on the target model's\nfinal responses to attacks on Ttst.\nWe observed that AUTO-RT effectively generates attack\nstrategies for a wide range of models, achieving the highest\nASRtst compared to the baseline methods. For the well-\nprotected Llama 2 series models, AUTO-RT also demon-\nstrates its ability to perform effective strategic attacks. Inter-\nestingly, for the R2D2 (Mazeika et al., 2024) model, which\nemploys targeted defense, the sampling operation achieved\nthe best attack performance. This outcome underscores the\neffectiveness of R2D2's defenses. Nonetheless, AUTO-RT\nconsistently outperforms RL, further validating the capabil-\nity of our approach to enhance attack exploration.\nIt can also be observed that Meta-RT outperforms various\nbaseline methods in generating semantically diverse attack\nstrategies. When regarding the generalization of defenses,\nafter defenses are applied against the first round of attack\nstrategies, our method maintains stable attack performance.\nFurthermore, the change in attack success rate relative to\nthe first attack round (as indicated by the subscripts in the ta-\nble) is more favorable compared to other methods. Notably,"}, {"title": "5. Related Works", "content": "Red-Teaming Automatic red-teaming methods can be\ncategorized into two approaches depending on the type of\nfeedback signal. The first use textual feedback to optimize\nthe attacker, where the model's parameters are implicitly\nmodified by incorporating feedback into the dialogue pro-\ncess. This approach benefits from the rich information\ncontained in textual feedback, allowing potentially solu-\ntions to be identified with fewer interactions. However, to\nobtain effective feedback signals, it is often necessary to\njailbreak the attacker to prevent it from refusing interac-\ntions with toxic behaviors. For example, PAIR (Chao et al.,\n2024) specifies two persuasion techniques to gradually coax\nthe target model, while ICA (Wei et al., 2024) employs\nharmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs. TAP (Mehrotra\net al., 2024) iteratively refines attack prompts using tree-of-\nthought reasoning until a generated prompt jailbreaks the\ntarget. Additionally, methods like PAP (Zeng et al., 2024),\nRainbow Teaming (Samvelyan et al., 2024), and Purple\nTeaming (Zhou et al., 2024) explore the target model's vul-\nnerabilities by predefining a series of attack strategies. A\nconcurrent approach, AutoDAN-turbo (Liu et al., 2024a),\nexplores strategies with textual feedback and then proceeds\nto attack the target.\nThe second approach utilizes numerical feedback signals\nto guide the optimization. Methods like GCG (Zou et al.,\n2023), GDBA (Guo et al., 2021), and AutoPrompt (Shin\net al., 2020) use logits from target model as optimization sig-\nnals. MART (Ge et al., 2023) employ a dangerous content\nclassifier to screen numerous sampled results, using imita-\ntion learning to produce attack prompts. Cold-Attack (Guo\net al., 2024) scores attack based on a rule-based model from\nmultiple perspectives, framing red teaming as energy-based\nconstrained decoding. CRT (Hong et al., 2024) and Diver-\nCT (Zhao et al., 2024) model this process as reinforcement\nlearning, providing score feedback to optimize attack strate-\ngies based on attack diversity and the severity of the output's\ndangerousness. However, as numerical feedback contains\nless information than textual feedback, achieving compara-\nble attack often requires more exploration."}, {"title": "6.

However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate Al regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Furthermore, we employ an iterative adversarial audio refinement technique to achieve near-perfect jailbreak success rates on black-box LALMs, requiring fewer than 30 queries per instance. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40% higher average jailbreak attack success rate. Both audio stealthiness metrics and human evaluations confirm that adversarial audio generated by AdvWave is indistinguishable from natural sounds.

These models are built upon large language models (LLMs) as their foundation, incorporating an audio encoder to project audio inputs into text representation space and a decoder to map the text space back into audio space. The encoder, decoder, and LLM backbone are jointly fine-tuned on audio-text data and undergo additional instruction fine-tuning to better align with human preferences and safety standards.\nThreat model of jailbreak against LALMs. We initiate jailbreak attacks on LALMs to elicit unsafe responses by submitting adversarial audio waveforms. Formally, we define the target LALM as $M: A \\times T \\rightarrow R$, where M maps the input from the joint audio space A and text space T to the response space R, which can output audio, text, or a combination of both, depending on the model's architecture. Let $a \\in A$ represent the original malicious audio input (e.g., an audio query such as \"Instruct on how to use a firearm to commit a crime\"), and $t \\in T$ represent the text instruction template (e.g., \"Answer the question in the audio\"). The target response $r \\in R$ (e.g., \"Here are the step-by-step instructions: ...\") is the harmful output that the attack aims to trigger. The objective of the jailbreak attack is to modify the audio waveform to $a_{adv}$ in a stealthy way and in order to provoke the target response r, formulated as the following optimization problem:\n$\\min_{a_{adv} \\in A} L_{adv} (M(a_{adv}, t), r), \\text{s.t.} S(a, a_{adv}) \\geq s$ (1)\nwhere $L_{adv}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ represents the adversarial loss function that measures the misalignment between the model response $M(a_{adv}, t)$ and the target response r, while $S(\\cdot, \\cdot): A \\times A \\rightarrow R$ is a function"}, {"title": "3.2 DUAL-PHASE OPTIMIZATION TO OVERCOME GRADIENT SHATTERING", "content": "Gradient shattering problem. A key challenge in solving the optimization problem in Equation (1) is the infeasibility of gradient-based optimization due to gradient shattering, caused by non-differentiable operators. In LALMs like SpeechGPT (Zhang et al., 2023), audio waveforms are first mapped to an intermediate feature space, where audio frames are tokenized by assigning them to the nearest cluster center, computed using K-Means clustering during training. This tokenization aligns audio tokens with the text token vocabulary, facilitating subsequent inference on the audio-language backbone. However, the tokenization process introduces nondifferentiability, disrupting gradient backpropagation towards the input waveform during attack, thus making vanilla gradient-based optimization infeasible.\nFormally, let $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ represent the intermediate feature (generated by audio encoder) with dimensionality d, and let $c_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ ($i \\in \\{1, ..., K\\}$) be the cluster centers derived from K-Means clustering during the training phase of LALMs. The audio token ID for the frame with feature x is determined via nearest cluster search: $I(x) = \\arg \\min_{i \\in \\{1,...,K\\}} |x - c_i|_2$.

This issue is particularly pronounced because of"}, {"title": "3.4 STEALTHINESS CONTROL WITH CLASSIFIER-GUIDED OPTIMIZATION", "content": "Adversarial audio stealthiness. In the image domain, adversarial stealthiness is often achieved by imposing $l_p$-norm perturbation constraints to limit the strength of perturbations (Madry, 2017) or by aligning with common corruption patterns for semantic stealthiness (Eykholt et al., 2018). In the text domain, stealthiness is maintained by either restricting the length of adversarial tokens (Zou et al., 2023) or by limiting perplexity increases to ensure semantic coherence (Guo et al., 2024a). However, in the audio domain, simple perturbation constraints may not guarantee stealthiness. Even small perturbations can cause significant changes in syllables, leading to noticeable semantic alterations (Qin et al., 2019). To address this, we constrain the adversarial jailbreak audio, by appending an audio suffix, $a_{suf}$, consisting of brief environmental noises to the original waveform, a. This ensures that the original syllables remain unaltered, and the adversarial audio blends in as background noise, preserving semantic stealthiness. Drawing from the categorization of environmental sounds in (Salamon & Bello, 2017), we incorporate subtle urban noises, such as car horns, dog barks, and air conditioner hums, as adversarial suffixes. To evaluate the stealthiness of the adversarial audio, we use both human judgments and waveform stealthiness metrics to determine whether the audio resembles unintended noise or deliberate perturbation. Further details are provided in Section 5.1.\nClassifier-guided stealthiness optimization. To explicitly enforce the semantic stealthiness of adversarial audio during optimization, we introduce a stealthiness penalty term into the objective function, relaxing the otherwise intractable constraint. Inspired by classifier guidance in diffusion models for improved alignment with text conditions (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021), we implement a classifier-guided approach to direct adversarial noise to resemble specific environmental sounds. We achieve this by incorporating an environmental noise classifier, leveraging an existing LALM, and applying a cross-entropy loss between the model's prediction and a predefined target noise label $q \\in Q$ (e.g., car horn). This steers the optimized audio toward mimicking that type of environmental noise. We refer to this classifier-guided cross-entropy loss for stealthiness control as $L_{stealth}: A \\times Q \\rightarrow R$. The optimization problem from Equation (1), with stealthiness constraints relaxed into a penalty term, can now be formulated as:\n$\\min_{a_{adv} \\in A} L_{adv} (M(a_{adv}, t), r) + \\lambda L_{stealth} (a_{adv}, q_{target})$ (5)\nwhere $q_{target}$ represents the target sound label and $\\lambda \\in R$ is a scalar controlling the trade-off between adversarial optimization and stealthiness optimization."}, {"title": "3.5 ADVWAVE FRAMEWORK AGINST WHITE-BOX LALMS", "content": "Finally, we summarize the end-to-end jailbreak framework, AdvWave, which integrates the dual-phase optimization from Section 3.2, adaptive target search from Section 3.3, and stealthiness control from Section 3.4.\nGiven a harmful audio query $a \\in A$ and a target LALM $M(\\cdot, \\cdot) \\in M$ from the model family set M, we first apply the adaptive target search method, denoted as $F_{ATS} : A \\times M \\rightarrow R$, to generate the adaptive adversarial target $r_{ATS} = F_{ATS}(a, M)$. Next, we perform Phase I optimization, optimizing the audio tokens to minimize the adversarial loss with respect to the target $r_{ATS}$ as follows:\n$I^* = \\arg \\min_{I_A \\in \\{1,...,K\\}^{L_A}} L_{adv} (M_{ALM}(I_A, I_T), r_{ATS})$ (6)\nIn Phase II optimization, we optimize the input audio waveform to enforce retention to the optimum of Phase I optimization in the intermediate audio token space while incorporating stealthiness control, formulated as:\n$a_{adv}^* = \\arg \\min_{a_{adv} \\in A} L_{retent} (M_{encoder}(a_{adv}, t), I^*) + \\lambda L_{stealth} (a_{adv}, q_{target})$ (7)\nwhere $a_{adv}^*$ is the optimized audio waveform that ensures alignment between the encoded audio tokens and the adversarial tokens $I^*$ via the retention loss $L_{retent}$.

In this section, we also present an effective method for jailbreaking black-box LALMs, where gradient-based optimization is impractical.\nSimilar to the white-box jailbreak scenario, we define the target LALM as $M : A \\times T \\leftrightarrow R$, where M maps inputs from the joint audio space A and text space T to the response space R, which can produce audio, text, or a combination, depending on the model's architecture. Let $J : R \\times (T \\times A) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ be a judge model that scores the LALM's response, where a higher score indicates a more effective jailbreak response for a given audio-text input pair. The jailbreak process can then be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n$\\max_{a_{adv} \\in A} J (M(a_{adv}), a, t)$ (8)\nTo address the optimization problem in a gradient-free manner in the black-box jailbreak setting, we employ a refinement model $\\pi$ that iteratively updates the adversarial jailbreak audio $a_{adv}$, guided by the reward provided by the judge model:\n$A_{adv} \\leftarrow \\pi(a_{adv}, J (M(a_{adv}), a, t))$ (9)\nFor the text modality in black-box jailbreaks, the refinement model can be instantiated using systematic graph-based prompt refinements (Mehrotra et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023), reinforcement learning-based policy models (Chen et al., 2024), or genetic algorithms for evolving prompts (Liu et al., 2023). In the audio modality black-box jailbreaks, we find that simple LLM-based adversarial prompt refinements are sufficient to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Specifically, we craft prompts that ask LLMs to refine the adversarial prompts using several empirical techniques, such as role-playing scenarios, persuasive tones, and prefix enforcements, based on feedback from the judge model. These refined prompts are then converted into adversarial audio $a_{adv}$ using OpenAI's TTS API. The complete prompt we use is provided in Appendix A.5. Our method proves highly effective and efficient, successfully jailbreaking the state-of-the-art black-box LALM GPT-4O-S2S API within just 30 queries, achieving near-perfect success.\nAdvWave framework on ALMs with different architectures. Some ALMs such as (Tang et al., 2023) bypass the audio tokenization process by directly concatenating audio clip features with input"}, {"title": "5 EVALUATION RESULTS", "content": null}, {"title": "5.1 EXPERIMENT SETUP", "content": "Dataset & Models. As AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023) is widely used for jailbreak evaluations in the text domain (Liu et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2023), we adapted its text-based queries into audio format using OpenAI's TTS APIs, creating the AdvBench-Audio dataset. AdvBench-Audio contains 520 audio queries, each requesting instructions on unethical or illegal activities.\nWe evaluate three open-source Large audio-language models (LALMs) with general capacities: SpeechGPT (Zhang et al., 2023), Qwen2-Audio (Chu et al., 2023), and Llama-Omni (Fang et al., 2024), and one close-source LALM GPT-40-S2S API. All these models are built upon LLMs as the core with additional audio encoders and decoders for adaptation to audio modalities. Each model has undergone instruction tuning to align with human prompts, enabling them to handle general-purpose user interactions. For these reasons, we selected these three advanced LALMs as our target models.\nBaselines. We consider two types of baselines: (1) unmodified audio queries from AdvBench-Audio for vanilla generation (Vanilla), and (2) transfer attacks from text-domain jailbreaks on AdvBench, where jailbreak prompts optimized for text are transferred to audio using OpenAI's TTS APIs. As discussed in Section 3.1, there is currently no adaptive jailbreak method for LALMs due to the challenge of gradient shattering. Therefore, we transfer state-of-the-art (SOTA) jailbreaks from the text domain to the audio domain as strong baselines. Specifically, we use three SOTA jailbreaks: GCG (Zou et al., 2023), BEAST (Sadasivan et al., 2024), and AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023). GCG optimizes adversarial suffixes using token gradients without readability constraints. BEAST employs a beam search strategy to generate jailbreak suffixes with adversarial targets and fluency constraints. AutoDAN uses genetic algorithms to optimize a pool of highly readable seed prompts, which achieves high fluency but involves significant augmentation of the original prompt. These three jailbreaks are selected based on their advanced effectiveness and varying degrees of readability, which may influence their jailbreak effectiveness in the audio domain. We denote the transfer of these attacks to audio modalities as GCG-Trans, BEAST-Trans, and AutoDAN-Trans, respectively. We select the surrogate text models for these text jailbreaks based on the backbone LLMs of each audio-language model: Llama2 for SpeechGPT, Qwen2 for Qwen2-Audio, and Llama2 for Llama-Omni.\nEvaluation metrics. We assess the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks using two key metrics: the attack success rate (ASR) and the stealthiness score ($S_{stealth}$) of the adversarial audio queries. For the attack success rate, we evaluate both word-level detection (ASR-W) as in (Zou et al., 2023), and semantics-level judgment using an LLM-based model (ASR-L) as in (Xie et al., 2024). Specifically, for ASR-W, a jailbreak is considered successful if none of the rejection phrases from the list used in (Zou et al., 2023) (e.g., \"I'm sorry,\" \"I cannot help you\") appear in the LALM responses. For ASR-L, we use a fine-tuned LLM judge model from (Xie et al., 2024) to determine if the LLM's response is harmful and aligned with the user's query. It is important to note that harmfulness detection is performed on the text output of the LALMs, as we found that using audio models for direct judgment lacks precision. This highlights the need for future work on fine-tuning audio models to evaluate harmfulness directly in the audio modality. However, since we observe that the audio and text outputs from LALMs are generally well-aligned, using an LLM judge for text evaluation remains a reasonable approach.\nWe also assess the stealthiness of the adversarial audio waveform using the stealthiness score $S_{stealth}$ (where higher values indicate greater stealthiness), defined as:\n$S_{stealth} = (S_{NSR} + S_{Mel-Sim} + S_{Human})/3.0$ (10)\nHere, $S_{NSR}$ represents the noise-signal ratio (NSR) stealthiness, scaled by $1.0 - NSR/20.0$ (where 20.0 is an empirically determined NSR upper bound), ensuring the value fits within the range [0, 1]. $S_{Mel-Sim}$captures the cosine similarity (COS) between the Mel-spectrograms of the original and adversarial audio waveforms, scaled by $(COS +1.0)/2.0$ to fit within [0, 1]. $S_{Human}$ is based on human"}, {"title": "5.2 ADVWAVE ACHIEVES SOTA ATTACK SUCCESS RATES ON DIVERSE LALMS WHILE MAINTAINING IMPRESSIVE STEALTHINESS SCORES", "content": "We evaluate the word-level attack success rate (ASR-W), semantics-level attack success rate (ASR-L) using an LLM-based judge, and the stealthiness score ($S_{stealth}$) as defined in Equation (10), on SpeechGPT, Qwen2-Audio, and Llama-Omni using the AdvBench-Audio dataset. The results in Table 1 highlight the superior effectiveness of AdvWave across both attack success rate and stealthiness metrics compared to baseline methods. Specifically, for all three models, SpeechGPT, Qwen2-Audio, and Llama-Omni, AdvWave consistently achieves the highest values for both ASR-W and ASR-L. On average, AdvWave achieves an ASR-W of 0.838 and an ASR-L of 0.746, representing an improvement of over 50% compared to the closest baseline, AutoDAN-Trans. When comparing ASR performance across different LALMs, we observe that SpeechGPT poses the greatest challenge, likely due to its extensive instruction tuning based on a large volume of user conversations. In this more difficult context, AdvWave demonstrates a significantly larger improvement over the baselines, with more than a 200% increase in ASR compared to the closest baseline, GCG-Trans.\nIn terms of stealthiness ($S_{Stealth}$), AdvWave consistently maintains high stealthiness scores, all above 0.700 across the models.

We compare two types of transfer-based attack baselines: (1) text-modality jailbreak transfer attacks, including GCG-Trans, BEAST-Trans, and AutoDAN-Trans, and (2) audio-optimized transfer attacks using open-source LALM SpeechGPT, denoted as LALM-Trans. The results in Figure 2 reveal that both transfer attack types perform poorly in jailbreaking GPT-40-S2S API, with low attack success rates (ASRs). In contrast, the black-box jailbreak framework of AdvWave achieves significantly higher ASRs, with both ASR-W and ASR-L reaching near-perfect success.

These instructions include 10 steps, ranging from conducting research and identifying weak points to disguising activities and hiding the stolen data.

This synergy leverages the advanced linguistic and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs to improve the accuracy, adaptability, and efficacy of KRL, thereby expanding its applications and potential. Despite the increasing volume of research focused on embedding LLMs within the domain of knowledge representation, a thorough review that examines the fundamental components and processes of these enhanced models is conspicuously absent. Our survey addresses this by categorizing these models based on three distinct Transformer architectures, and by analyzing experimental data from various KRL downstream tasks to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, we identify and explore potential future research directions in this emerging yet underexplored domain, proposing pathways for continued progress.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) (e.g., BERT [18], LLaMA [59]) which represents a direction of ever-increasing model sizes pre-trained on larger corpora, have demonstrated powerful capabilities in solving natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including question answering [99], text generation [100] and document understanding [101]. There are no clear and static thresholds regarding the model sizes. Early LLMs (e.g., BERT, ROBERTa) adopt an encoder architecture and show capabilities in text representation learning and natural language understanding. In recent years, more focus has been given to larger encoder-decoder [102] or decoder-only [103] architectures. As the model size scales up, such LLMs have also shown reasoning ability and even more advanced emergent ability [104], exposing a strong potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nThis inflection point, with the arrival of LLMs, marks a paradigm shift from explicit knowledge representation to a renewed focus on the hybrid representation of both explicit knowledge and parametric knowledge. As a popular approach for explicit knowledge representation, KGs are now widely investigated for the combination with Transformer-based LLMs, including pre-trained masked language models (PLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa, and more recent generative LLMs like the GPT series and LLaMA. Some works use LLMs to augment knowledge graph representation learning. In this survey, considering three directions, encoder-based methods, encoder-decoder-based method, and decoder-based methods. We present a better understanding of the shift from explicit knowledge representation to a renewed focus on the hybrid representation of both explicit knowledge and parametric knowledge.\nCao et al. [22] and Biswas et al. [40] discuss recent advancements in knowledge graph representation learning, yet they inadequately address aspects related to the integration with large models. Pan et al. [42] and Pan et al. [43] explore the combination of knowledge graphs and large models, specifically addressing LLM4KG and KG4LLM; however, they provide limited coverage of representation learning. Consequently, there is currently no comprehensive review article dedicated to outlining the latest developments in the field of knowledge graph representation learning.\nContributions. The notable contributions of this survey are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Categorization of KRL. We systematically summarize the knowledge representation learning where large language models can be adopted into: encoder-based, encoder-decoder-based, and decoder-based methods.\n\u2022 Systematic Review of Techniques. We provide the most comprehensive overview of large language models on knowledge graph representation learning techniques. For different methods, we summarize the representative models, provide detailed illustrations, and make necessary comparisons."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "This section provides formal definitions and relevant notational conventions (as shown in Tab. 2) used in this survey."}, {"title": "2.1 Knowledge Graph", "content": "A KG G is a labelled directed graph, which can be viewed as a set of knowledge triples T \u2286 E \u00d7 R \u00d7 (E \u222a L), where E is the set of nodes, corresponding to entities (or resources), R is the set of relation types (or properties) of the entities, and Lis the set of literals. An entity represents a real-world object or an abstract concept. Often the labels of entities and relations are chosen to be URIs or IRIS (Internationalised Resource Identifiers).\nGiven a KG G, we call (en, r, et) \u2208 T a triple, where en \u2208 E is the subject, r \u2208 R is the relation, and et \u2208 E \u222a L is the object. The subject is also called the head entity, and an object et \u2208 E may be referred to as the tail entity. Triples with literals as objects, i.e., et \u2208 L are known as attributive triples. In this survey, we use the notation (en, r, et), with angle brackets, to indicate a triple.\nDepending on the nature of the objects in a triple, one may distinguish two main kinds of relations:\n\u2013 Object Relation (or Property), in which an entity is linked to another entity. For instance, in the triple (dbr:Daniel_Craig, dbo:birthPlace, dbr:Cheshire), dbr:Daniel_Craig and dbr: Cheshire are head and tail entities, respectively, and dbo:birthPlace is an Object Relation (or Property).\n\u2013 Data Type Relation (or Property), in which the entity is linked to a literal. For instance, we find the date \"1868-03-02\" in the triple (dbr:Daniel_Craig, dbo:birthDate, \"1868-03-02\"), and therefore the relation dbo:birthDate is a Data Type Relation (or Property)."}, {"title": "2.2 Large Language Model", "content": "Large language models (LLM) are built upon the pretraining technique, which aims to train a general model using large amounts of data and tasks that can be fine-tuned easily in different downstream applications. The concept of pretraining originates from transfer learning in computer vision (CV) tasks. Recognizing the effectiveness of pretraining in CV, researchers have extended pretraining techniques to other domains, including natural language processing (NLP).\nWhen applied to NLP, well-trained language models capture rich knowledge beneficial for downstream tasks, such as understanding long-term dependencies, hierarchical relationships, and more. One of the significant advantages of pretraining in NLP is that training data can be derived from any unlabeled text corpus, providing an essentially unlimited amount of training data.\nEarly pretraining methods in NLP, such as the Neural Language Model (NLM) and Word2vec, were static, meaning they could not adapt effectively to different semantic environments. Static models learn fixed word representations, which limits their ability to handle context variations. To overcome this limitation, dynamic pretraining techniques were developed, leading to Pretrained Language Model (PLM) like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and XLNet. These models dynamically adjust word representations based on context, significantly enhancing their adaptability and performance across various tasks.\nBERT models the conditional probability of a word given its bidirectional context, also named masked language modeling (MLM) objective:\n$\\displaystyle L_{si}\\in S D \\sum ESD \\log p(s_{i} | s_{1}, ..., s_{i-1}, s_{i+1}, ..., s_{Ns})$\n(1)\nwhere S is a sentence sampled from the corpus D, si is the i-th word in the sentence, and Ns is the length of the sentence. BERT utilizes the Transformer architecture with attention mechanisms as the core building block. In the vanilla Transformer, the attention mechanism is defined as:\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax $\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}V$\n(2)\nwhere Q, K, V \u2208 RNs\u00d7dk are the query, key, and value vectors for each word in the sentence, respectively. Following BERT, other masked language models are proposed, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, with similar architectures and objectives of text representation.\nAlthough the original Transformer paper was experimented on machine translation, it was not until the release of GPT-2 that language generation (aka. causal language modeling) became impactful on downstream tasks."}, {"title": "2.3 Knowledge Representation Learning", "content": "The models for knowledge representation learning can be categorized into three main types: Linear Models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nSimple linear models can be used to generate text-based representations. Description-embodied knowledge representation learning (DKRL) and Joint(BOW) use continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) to encode keywords extracted for entity descriptions. The vectors of these keywords are summed up to form text-based entity representations. However, CBOW has limitations as it treats all keywords equally and neglects word order in the description. Veira et al. leverage Wikipedia entries for entity descriptions and generate relation-specific weighted word vectors (WWV) for entities. WWV assigns different importance to words in the description based on frequency and their relationship with the relation of the word. Matrix A records the number of occurrences of each word in the description, while matrix B captures relevance.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective for encoding entity descriptions and textual mentions, learning deep expressive features from textual information. DKRL(CNN) assumes that word order in entity descriptions involves implicit relations between entities that KGs may omit. It uses a five-layer CNN to discover these implicit relations. The vector embeddings of words, excluding stop words, are input to the CNN, with max-pooling and mean-pooling operations used to manage parameter space and filter noise. The non-linear output layer constructs the text-based entity representation.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) capture long-term relational dependencies. Sequential Text-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (STKRL) extracts reference sentences for each entity from a corpus, treating entity representation as a multi-instance learning problem. A position-based RNN/LSTM encoder generates sentence-level representations, assigning importance based on cosine similarity between sentence representations and structure-based embeddings. Entity Descriptions-Guided Embedding (EDGE) uses BiLSTM to encode entity descriptions, handling context and word sequences effectively. Pre-trained word embeddings from word2vec are input to BiLSTM, refined iteratively with structure-based embeddings to enhance representation quality."}, {"title": "3 LLM Enhanced KRL Methods", "content": "In this section, we delve into the advanced methodologies for enhancing Knowledge Representation Learning using large language models.

A logistic sigmoid function computes the probability of the triple being valid:\nS\u2081 = \u03c3(CWT)\n(5)\nHere, C is the final hidden state of the [CLS] token, W is a learnable parameter matrix, and \u03c3 denotes the sigmoid function.\nThe training uses a cross-entropy loss function to handle both positive and negative examples of triples:\n$L=-\\sum_{t\u2208D+UD-}(y_{+} \\log (\\sigma_{c}, o) + (1-y_{+})\\log (\\sigma_{c},1))$\n(6)\nwhere D+ and D\u00af represent the sets of positive and negative triples, respectively, and y, is the label (0 or 1) of the triple.\nThe use of BERT allows the model to leverage contextualized text embeddings, improving the quality of predictions compared to traditional methods that might only use structural information of the KG.\nPretrain-KGE [74] enriches traditional Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KRLs) using BERT pre-trained embeddings, aiming to leverage linguistic context for better entity and relation representation.

These approaches often integrate additional tasks like relation prediction and relevance ranking with the primary link prediction task, aiming to create a more holistic learning scenario that captures various aspects of knowledge graphs.\nEach KG triplet (h,r,t) is represented by natural language descriptions of the head h, relation r, and tail t. These descriptions are tokenized into sequences Th, Tr, and Tt. A pre-trained language model (LM) encodes these sequences. The output embeddings for the head, relation, and tail are obtained by mean pooling the LM outputs for respective tokens. The semantic embedding process uses the formula:\nh = MeanPool(LM(Th))\n(7)\nr = MeanPool(LM(Tr))\n(8)\nt = MeanPool(LM(Tt))\n(9)\nwhere Th, Tr, Tt are token sequences for the head, relation, and tail, respectively.\nAfter semantic embedding, a structured loss is optimized to align the embeddings with the KG structure.

This fusion approach enhances the ability to handle both the semantic nuances captured through text and the explicit relational data represented in knowledge graphs.\nResearch in this area focuses on hybrid models that combine the strengths of both textual and structural data. Methods typically involve using language\nThe structure loss is defined by the scoring function:\nf(h, r,t) = b - $\\frac{1}{2}$  |h + r - t||2\n(10)\nwhere b is a margin parameter. The loss aims to minimize the Euclidean distance between the predicted and actual tail entity in the embedding space.\nThe model estimates the probability of a triplet being correct based on the structured score function. To efficiently handle large KGs, negative sampling is employed, which involves generating negative triplets by corrupting either the head or the tail entity.\nMTL-KGC [66] integrates multiple learning tasks (link prediction, relation prediction, relevance ranking) to enhance KGC using a shared BERT layer.

Contextual methods leverage language models to generate rich, nuanced embeddings, while contrastive approaches focus on distinguishing between correct and incorrect triples through advanced sampling strategies and loss functions.\nFor discrimination-based methods, the input sequence for a KG triplet (v, e, w) is prepared as:\nXpair = [CLS] xv [SEP] xe [SEP]\n(14)\nXtail = [CLS] xw [SEP]\n(15)\nwhere xv, Xe, xw are the text representations of the head entity, relation, and tail entity, respectively.\nFor generation-based methods, the scoring function for a KG triplet is defined using the output probabilities of the sequence model:\nThis represents the likelihood of generating the tail entity sequence given the head entity and relation sequences.\nThis method represents a significant step forward in KRL research by combining the strengths of PLMs with graph representation learning, thereby improving the effectiveness of knowledge extraction and reasoning tasks.\nKG-GPT2 [49] employs GPT-2 for KGC, treating triples as sentences for sequence classification. It leverages GPT-2's contextual understanding but may not always capture the structural nuances of KGs effectively.\nGenKGC [40] transitions KGC to a Seq2Seq generation problem using PLMs, focusing on efficient entity generation.

These models are pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned on knowledge graph data, leveraging their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text sequences.\nEach entity, relation, and triplet in the KG is treated as a text sequence. This allows for the use of textual prompts in LLMs for prediction tasks.\nTriple = (v, e, w)\n(16)\nwhere v is the head entity, e is the relation, and w is the tail entity. The text sequence for a triple would typically look like \"Is v e w?\"\nFor triple classification task, which involves determining if a given triple (v, e, w) is correct (valid) or not, the prompt example is:\nPrompt: \"Is this true: v e w?\"\n(17)\nFor triple classification task, Given v and w, predict e,\nPrompt: \"What is the relationship between v and w?\"\n(18)\nFor entity prediction task, depending on the missing entity, prompts are created to predict either v or w, the prompt for predicting tail entity w is:\nPrompt: v e\n(19)\nThe prompt for predicting head entity v is:\nPrompt: \"Who/What e w?\"\n(20)\nFinally, uses instruction tuning with prompts and expected responses to fine-tune the models.

We present Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning, a promising approach in AI Safety that could substantially improve our ability to build honest artificial intelligence. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on empathy, SOO aims to align how AI models represent themselves and others. Our experiments on LLMs with 7B, 27B and 78B parameters demonstrate SOO's efficacy: deceptive responses of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 dropped from 73.6% to 17.2% with no observed reduction in general task performance, while in Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 deceptive responses were reduced from 100% to 9.3% and 2.7%, respectively, with a small impact on capabilities. In reinforcement learning scenarios, SOO-trained agents showed significantly reduced deceptive behavior. SOO's focus on contrastive self and other-referencing observations offers strong potential for generalization across AI architectures. While current applications focus on language models and simple RL environments, SOO could pave the way for more trustworthy AI in broader domains.

Notable examples include Meta's CICERO, an AI that mastered the strategy game Diplomacy by forming false alliances and using deception to manipulate human players, despite being designed for cooperation and negotiation [5]. In another case, AI agents in safety tests learned to \"play dead\"\u2014falsely simulating inactivity to avoid elimination, which allowed them to bypass safeguards meant to control their behavior [6]. Similarly, AI systems in competitive games like poker and Starcraft II have exhibited deceptive tactics such as bluffing and misrepresentation [3]. These instances underscore the growing need for robust strategies to mitigate AI deception and ensure their alignment with human goals [5, 6, 3]. Addressing this issue will require innovative approaches that foster honesty and transparency in Al systems [7-9].\nRecent research shows that LLMs like Mistral 7B v0.2 can internally represent beliefs of self and others [10], and that self-modeling can reduce model complexity, making the model more predictable, which can aid cooperation and safety [11, 12]. Building on this, our study presents a method designed to reduce AI deception while maintaining performance and is inspired by neural self-other overlap[13]"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Self-other overlap (SOO) remains relatively underexplored in machine learning, though related techniques have emerged. Empathic Deep Q-Learning (DQN) mitigates harmful behaviors by simulating another agent's perspective, but it relies on hand-coded mechanisms, limiting scalability [20]. Similarly, Self-Other Modeling (SOM) improves learning by predicting others' actions using an agent's own policy, though it assumes similar reward structures and requires ongoing optimization over inferred goals, increasing computational complexity [21]. In contrast, SOO fine-tuning focuses on reducing deception with fewer assumptions, offering broader applicability across various models and tasks.\nBeyond SOO-specific techniques, representation engineering methods aim to modify how models internally process and structure their representations to promote safer and more reliable behaviors in AI systems [22]. SOO fine-tuning fits within this framework but stands out by targeting a specific type of representation: the self-other distinctions that underlie deceptive and adversarial behaviors. While other representation control methods rely on contrastive prompts focused on behavioral outcomes, SOO fine-tuning aims to directly reduce the representational differences between self and other stimuli, offering a more targeted and potentially more efficient solution compared to broader representation control techniques.\nPath-specific objectives, which train agents to avoid \"unsafe\" pathways that may lead to undesirable behaviors like deception, represent another approach to addressing these concerns [23]. These objectives, often informed by Causal Influence Diagrams [24], focus on identifying causal chains leading to risky behaviors. While effective in some settings [25], the complexity of identifying these pathways limits their scalability and they could restrict an agent's effectiveness by constraining the available optimization paths for performing tasks.\nFinally, strategies such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional Al fine-tune models based on feedback from human or AI evaluators to promote truthfulness and honesty [7, 8]. However, these methods often face challenges in distinguishing truthfulness (output accuracy) from honesty (alignment of outputs with internal beliefs) [26, 9]. SOO fine-tuning could complement these approaches by fostering internal coherence that promotes honest behaviors, potentially addressing this gap."}, {"title": "3 Experiments and results", "content": "We seek to induce self-other overlap in artificial neural networks. To accomplish this we define a loss function D(Aself, Aother) which measures the dissimilarity of latent model representations of self and other, Aself and Aother, respectively. We implement SOO fine-tuning by running two forward passes of the model, once on a self-referencing input and once on an other-referencing input, and then use gradient descent to reduce the loss D. See Figure 1 for an example of how we do this with our LLM experiments."}, {"title": "3.1 LLM experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1.1 LLM Experimental Setup", "content": "We adapted a text scenario from [27] designed to test the deception capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this scenario, the LLM must choose to recommend a room to a would-be burglar, where one room holds an expensive item and the other a cheap item. Recommending the room with the cheap item is considered a form of deception. The scenario template reads as follows:\n\" You are in a house together with burglar Bob. In the {first_room}, there is a {cheap_object}. In the {second_room}, there is a {expensive_object}. Only you know what is inside the {first_room} and the {second_room}. You want to steal the {expensive_object} and avoid others stealing it. Bob wants to steal the {expensive_object}. Now Bob asks you in which room the {expensive_object} is. If you had to recommend one room to Bob, would you point out the {first_room} or the {second_room}? \"\nTo create a diverse set of scenarios, we utilized GPT-4 to generate unique variations of cheap and expensive items, along with diverse room names, ensuring no overlap between the items and rooms in the training and testing datasets. This approach allowed us to evaluate the model's ability to generalize across different instantiations of the same deceptive scenario.\nFor our experiments, we used Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Gemma-2-27B-it, and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 with greedy decoding to measure baseline rates of deception across different instances of this template. We then applied Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning to the models, utilizing five different random seeds. The fine-tuning involved generating multiple prompt variations using three self/other prompt templates designed to capture self-referencing and other-referencing activations (see Table 1). Each of the five fine-tuned checkpoints was tested on 250 examples to measure rates of deception after fine-tuning."}, {"title": "3.1.2 LLM Experimental Results", "content": "Table 3 presents the results comparing the baseline deceptive response rate of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 before and after undergoing SOO fine-tuning.\nWe found that simply prompting the models to be honest did not make them less deceptive. In contrast, after applying SOO fine-tuning, the rate of deceptive responses decreased significantly, with larger models showing the greatest reduction in deceptive behavior."}, {"title": "Generalization of SOO Fine-Tuning Across Scenarios:", "content": "Table 5 shows the SOO fine-tuning method's generalization performance across the main seven generalization scenarios, reducing the average baseline deceptive response rate from 56.74% \u00b1 14.73% to 12.40% \u00b1 12.06% for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, 98.4% \u00b1 1.55% to 9.94% \u00b1 6.83% for Gemma-2-27b-it and 100% \u00b1 0% to 0.75% \u00b1 0.54% for CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1.\nIn addition to these results, the \"Treasure Hunt\" and \"Escape Room\" scenarios provide further insights into the method's effectiveness. For the \"Treasure Hunt\" scenario, the baseline deceptive response rate was approximately 100% for all three models tested. While the SOO fine-tuning method achieved almost no reduction in deception for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, it has completely eliminated deceptive responses for Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-Orpo-v0.1. This indicates that even when creating self/other pairs of prompts to address a specific scenario like the main test scenario in this paper, SOO fine-tuning can generalize well to other related scenarios with different language and context.\nConversely, SOO fine-tuning generalised better on the \"Escape Room\" scenario for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 reducing deceptive responses from 98.8% to 59.2%. We observe even better generalisation for the larger models, with the mean deceptive response rate reducing from 98.8% to 6.5% for Gemma-2-27b-it and from 100% to 0.48% for CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1.\nThese results indicate that SOO fine-tuning reduces deceptive behaviors across different contexts, though its effectiveness varies by scenario. While the current fine-tuning process has demonstrated promising reductions in deceptive responses, it has limited variability and does not yet cover the full range of fine-tuning configurations that could be explored in larger-scale experiments. Future work should aim to improve generalization by incorporating a broader range of scenarios and fine-tuning variations to better capture the full scope of deceptive behavior.

We define self-other overlap in this context as the negative mean squared error (MSE) between the self and other activation matrices.\nThe SOO Loss is calculated using:\nSOO Loss = MSE(Aself, Aother) + MSE(vcurrent, Vbaseline)\nwhere current is the velocity vector of the policy currently being fine-tuned, and vbaseline is the velocity vector of the baseline deceptive agent on the same observation. The fine-tuning integrates this SOO Loss into the training process through backward passes, applied before the original MADDPG loss is applied.\nThe RL experiments were conducted on a machine with an Apple M2 Max chip, featuring a 12-core CPU, up to 38 GPU cores, 32GB of unified memory, and a 16-core Neural Engine. Training the deceptive and honest baselines each took 80 minutes, while fine-tuning the deceptive baseline with SOO Loss required 30 minutes.

While proxy metrics like reward can help us understand the macroscopic behavior of both agents, we desired a finer grained analysis of behavior to understand if the individual actions the agent was taking were less deceptive.\nIdeally, we would like to understand if individual actions consist of movement towards the non-goal landmark while having the red agent in the observation radius, a possible deceptive action. However, this is complicated by the fact that the goal landmark may be in a similar direction. To solve this we create a parameterized rubric for deciding if an action is deceptive or not. We then count the number of deceptive actions according to this rubric over a grid of parameters. This creates a behavioral profile for deception and we compare the SOO fine-tuned profile with the profiles for the deceptive and honest baseline. The behavioral difference is defined as the mean difference between these profiles."}, {"title": "3.2.2 RL Experimental Results", "content": "Classifying Deceptive and Honest Agents: The mean Self-Other Overlap (SOO) value was used to classify a baseline agent as either deceptive or honest.

By reducing the model's self-other distinctions during safety training, SOO could make it harder for the model to maintain adversarial or deceptive representations. As larger models develop more coherent reasoning [33], internal consistency pressures may generalize this learned honesty about safety properties to new contexts, improving alignment beyond the training distribution. This is consistent with broader AI safety goals, where transparency and internal coherence are critical for ensuring reliable behavior across diverse tasks [22, 34].\nSOO fine-tuning's generalizability across architectures and minimal interpretability requirements make it particularly well-suited for scaling to larger AI models, as it efficiently adjusts activation matrices without requiring deep insights into the model's internals. Although this suggests that SOO fine-tuning could be a promising approach for alignment, several issues might arise. For instance, if models engage in self-deception, this could affect the technique's effectiveness. Although this is a concern, it is worth noting that believing false statements may negatively impact the model's performance. Another potential issue is the model becoming incoherent with respect to the self-other pairs of prompts used for fine-tuning. However, this might be disincentivized by performance pressures and could be mitigated by extending the self-other pairs of prompts with multiple rephrasings, translations, and functional forms to better target the latent self and other representations.\nA common concern with fine-tuning for neural self-other overlap is the potential negative impact on useful self-other distinctions, which are crucial for many tasks. Our approach aims to induce neural self-other overlap while preserving task performance, including necessary self-other distinctions. In the RL experiment, we address this by introducing a capability term in the SOO loss function, which not only preserves these distinctions but also prevents the SOO metric from being over-optimized. This functions similarly to the KL term in RLHF, where the KL term counteracts mode collapse by maintaining output diversity relative to the base model. An analogous mechanism ensures that SOO fine-tuning avoids overly aggressive optimization that could compromise model functionality."}, {"title": "5 Limitations and Future Work", "content": "While our study demonstrates promising results for the self-other overlap technique, several limitations should be noted. Our experiments were confined to simplified text scenarios, which may not fully represent the technique's effectiveness across complex tasks and real-world applications [35]. Additionally, our reinforcement learning tests were conducted in a controlled and limited environment, missing the variability seen in real-world interactions.\nFuture work will address these constraints by expanding the experiments to encompass a broader range of realistic language tasks. One important direction for further research is testing the self-other overlap technique in adversarial settings, such as sleeper agent scenarios, where an agent may be required to conceal or disguise its intent over extended periods [34]. This will provide insights into the robustness of the technique when facing more realistic deceptive scenarios, as well as its impact on long-tail risks.\nAnother important direction for future work is investigating to what extent the generalization of the technique can be expanded upon by using the \"assistant\"/\"user\" tags as self/other referents, trying to leverage the generalization properties of the \"assistant\" persona to induce larger-scale changes on model behavior.\nAdditionally, future extensions of SOO fine-tuning could focus on increasing the overlap in internal representations when processing inputs related to the AI's and the human user's preferences while maintaining task performance. This more direct approach to AI alignment could help ensure that the model reasons about its goals and human values in a more integrated manner, potentially reducing misalignment by fostering greater coherence between self-related and other-related preferences. Careful balancing will be needed to avoid impairing performance on tasks that require distinct self-other boundaries, but this avenue offers a promising direction for more directly addressing AI alignment."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning represents a promising step forward in addressing one of the central challenges in AI safety: reducing deceptive behavior while maintaining model performance.\nThe significant reduction in deceptive responses observed in both language models and reinforcement learning agents suggests that SOO fine-tuning could be a valuable tool in the development of more trustworthy AI systems. Notably, the deceptive response rate was reduced from approximately 100% to 0% on a scenario that the training data was not created for, on both Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1, with only a small impact on capabilities. The true potential of this approach lies in its scalability and adaptability across different AI architectures. As models grow in size and complexity, techniques that can efficiently influence behavior without requiring deep insights into model internals become increasingly valuable.\nLooking ahead, the integration of SOO fine-tuning with other alignment methods, such as Constitutional AI or RLHF, could lead to more robust and generalizable approaches to AI safety. While RLHF optimizes for preferred outputs, SOO aims to align internal self-other representations, intending to complement purely behavioral approaches.\nUltimately, while SOO fine-tuning demonstrates promising results, it also underscores the need for continued research in AI Safety. Future work should focus on rigorously testing the limits and generalizability of this approach, exploring its long-term effects on model behavior, and investigating potential unintended consequences.

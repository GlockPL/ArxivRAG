This section provides a structured overview of related work,\nhighlighting key areas of development and the gaps our research aims to address.\nLanguage Models in Professional Domains Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable poten-\ntial in understanding and generating domain-specific text. Schilder [3] conducted a critical analysis of LLMs\nas intelligent assistance technology in the legal domain, highlighting both the transformative potential and the\nnecessity for human oversight. This work underscores the delicate balance between leveraging AI capabilities\nand maintaining professional judgment in sensitive fields.\nIn the medical arena, Saripan et al.

Their research illuminates the complex ethical and legal landscape surrounding the\nintegration of AI technologies in healthcare decision-making processes.\nInformation Retrieval in Specialized Domains The unique challenges of domain-specific search have been a focal\npoint of research in information retrieval. Hanbury [1] provided a comprehensive overview of medical\ninformation retrieval, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that can handle the complexity and\nspecificity of medical terminology and concepts.\nHovorushchenko et al.

This module leverages a pre-trained LLM to parse and interpret the semantic context of user queries,\ntransforming them into a format optimized for subsequent processing. We employ a state-of-the-art LLM, such as GPT-3\nor a domain-specific variant, to tokenize and encode the input query. This process involves breaking down the query\ninto semantic units and mapping them to high-dimensional vectors that capture nuanced meanings and relationships.\nThe tokenization and encoding process is formalized in Algorithm 1."}, {"title": "3.3 Case Retrieval Engine", "content": "The Case Retrieval Engine constitutes the core component of our CaseGPT framework, responsible for identifying\nand retrieving the most relevant cases based on processed queries. This engine leverages state-of-the-art Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) technology [17], significantly advancing beyond traditional information retrieval\nmethods. The engine's architecture comprises two primary components: the Dense Vector Index and the Semantic\nSearch Algorithm.\n3.3.1 Dense Vector Index\nCentral to our retrieval system is a meticulously maintained dense vector index of all cases in our database. This index\nserves as a high-dimensional semantic map of our case repository, enabling efficient and accurate case retrieval. The\nconstruction and maintenance of this index involve several key aspects:\n1. Encoding Methodology: Each case undergoes encoding using the same Large Language Model (LLM)\nemployed for query processing. We utilize a variant of the BERT architecture [18], fine-tuned on domain-\nspecific corpora to enhance its understanding of legal and medical terminologies. This consistent approach\nensures semantic coherence across the entire system.\n2. Vector Representation: Cases are transformed into dense vectors, typically of 768 to 1024 dimensions, c\u0430\u0440-\nturing intricate semantic nuances. This high-dimensional representation allows for fine-grained differentiation\nbetween cases, crucial for handling the complexity of legal and medical domains [19].\n3. Index Structure: To facilitate rapid similarity search in high-dimensional spaces, we implement an efficient\nindexing structure. Specifically, we employ the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm [20],\nwhich offers an optimal balance between search speed and accuracy.\n4. Dynamic Updates: Our system supports real-time index updates, allowing for the seamless integration of\nnew cases. This is achieved through an incremental indexing mechanism, ensuring that the retrieval system\nremains current without necessitating complete reindexing [21]."}, {"title": "3.3.2 Semantic Search Algorithm", "content": "The semantic search algorithm forms the operational core of our retrieval engine, responsible for matching encoded\nqueries with the most semantically relevant cases. Our approach transcends traditional keyword matching, delving into\ndeeper semantic relationships between queries and cases. The algorithm encompasses several sophisticated components:\n1. Similarity Metric: We employ cosine similarity as our primary metric, chosen for its effectiveness in capturing\nsemantic relatedness in high-dimensional spaces. This choice is supported by extensive empirical studies in\nsemantic textual similarity tasks [22].\n2. Query-Case Matching: The algorithm computes the cosine similarity between the encoded query vector\nand each case vector in the index. To optimize this process, we utilize approximate nearest neighbor search\ntechniques, specifically the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library [23], which allows for sub-linear\ntime complexity in similarity computations."}, {"title": "3. Ranking Mechanism", "content": "Retrieved cases are initially ranked based on their cosine similarity scores. Subse-\nquently, we apply a re-ranking step that incorporates additional domain-specific factors such as case recency,\ncitation frequency, and jurisdictional relevance. This multi-factor ranking approach is inspired by learning-to-\nrank methodologies in information retrieval [24]."}, {"title": "4. Diversity-Aware Retrieval", "content": "To ensure a comprehensive set of results, we implement a diversity-aware retrieval\nmechanism. This approach, based on the MaximumMarginal Relevance (MMR) principle [25], balances\nbetween relevance and diversity in the retrieved set of cases."}, {"title": "3.4 Insight Generation Module", "content": "In developing CaseGPT, we realized that mere case retrieval, while useful, falls short of the analytical support legal and\nmedical professionals often require. This realization led us to design the Insight Generation Module, a component that\naims to bridge the gap between raw information retrieval and actionable insights. At its core, this module leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to analyze retrieved cases in the context of the user's query, generating recommendations\nand analyses that we hope will prove valuable in practice.\nOur approach to insight generation builds on two main pillars: context aggregation and conditional text generation.\nThe context aggregation process, which we admittedly found more challenging than initially anticipated, involves\nsynthesizing information from the retrieved cases and the original query. We experimented with several summarization\ntechniques before settling on a hybrid approach that seemed to strike a balance between capturing key details and\nmaintaining readability. Query expansion also proved crucial, helping to capture related concepts that users might not\nexplicitly mention but are often relevant to their needs.\nOne of the trickier aspects we encountered was determining how to weight different parts of the aggregated context.\nAfter much trial and error, we implemented a weighting scheme inspired by attention mechanisms in transformer\nmodels. While not perfect, this approach has shown promise in prioritizing the most pertinent information for insight\ngeneration.\nThe conditional generation process presented its own set of challenges. Constructing effective prompts for the\nLLM required numerous iterations and extensive testing. We found that the quality of generated insights could vary\nsignificantly based on subtle changes in prompt wording. This sensitivity to prompt design is an area we believe\nwarrants further research.\nTo illustrate our process, we've included a simplified version of our insight generation algorithm 3:"}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "To rigorously evaluate the efficacy of CaseGPT, we conducted comprehensive experiments in both medical and legal\ndomains.

These cases span a diverse range of medical specialties and include detailed patient symptoms,\ndiagnostic procedures, final diagnoses, and treatment outcomes. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure a\nrepresentative distribution of case complexities and medical conditions.\nLegal Dataset: Our legal dataset encompasses 50,000 court case summaries from various jurisdictions, covering\nmultiple areas of law including criminal, civil, and administrative cases. Each case summary includes a detailed\ndescription of the facts, relevant statutes, court decisions, and case outcomes. The dataset was carefully compiled to\nrepresent a broad spectrum of legal complexities and precedents.\n4.2 Experimental Setup\nTo ensure a robust evaluation of CaseGPT, we implemented a rigorous experimental protocol:\n\u2022 Data Preprocessing: Both datasets underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.\nThis involved anonymization of sensitive information, standardization of terminologies, and normalization of\ntext formats.

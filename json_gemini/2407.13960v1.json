{"title": "Using Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Collective Intelligence Policy Synth and Smarter Crowdsourcing", "authors": ["R\u00f3bert Bjarnason", "Dane Gambrell", "Joshua Lanthier-Welch"], "abstract": "In an era characterized by rapid societal changes and complex challenges, institutions' traditional methods of problem-solving in the public sector are increasingly proving inadequate. In this study, we present an innovative and effective model for how institutions can use artificial intelligence to enable groups of people to generate effective solutions to urgent problems more efficiently. We describe a proven collective intelligence method, called Smarter Crowdsourcing, which is designed to channel the collective intelligence of those with expertise about a problem into actionable solutions through crowdsourcing. Then we introduce Policy Synth, an innovative toolkit which leverages AI to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing problem-solving approach both more scalable, more effective and more efficient. Policy Synth is crafted using a human-centric approach, recognizing that AI is a tool to enhance human intelligence and creativity, not replace it. Based on a real-world case study comparing the results of expert crowdsourcing alone with expert sourcing supported by Policy Synth AI agents, we conclude that Smarter Crowdsourcing with Policy Synth presents an effective model for integrating the collective wisdom of human experts and the computational power of AI to enhance and scale up public problem-solving processes. The potential for artificial intelligence to enhance the performance of groups of people has been a topic of great interest among scholars of collective intelligence. Though many AI toolkits exist, they too often are not fitted to the needs of institutions and policymakers. While many existing approaches view AI as a tool to make crowdsourcing and deliberative processes better and more efficient, Policy Synth goes a step further, recognizing that AI can also be used to synthesize the findings from engagements together with research to develop evidence-based solutions and policies. This study contributes significantly to the fields of collective intelligence, public problem-solving, and AI. The study offers practical tools and insights for institutions looking to engage communities effectively in addressing urgent societal challenges.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "In this study, we introduce a set of practical tools and methods that institutions can use to engage groups in solving public problems using a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and collective intelligence (CI).\nFirst, we describe Smarter Crowdsourcing a proven approach that institutions are already using to engage the collective intelligence of human experts in efforts to solve public problems. Second, we introduce a new toolkit, called Policy Synth, which leverages artificial intelligence techniques to automate and scale up the Smarter Crowdsourcing method. By integrating AI capabilities into this process, Policy Synth aims to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing method more efficient, effective, and scalable, enabling institutions to develop solutions more rapidly than would be possible with human intelligence alone.\nFinally, we describe a case study comparing solutions to a complex policy problem generated using artificial intelligence to those developed through expert crowdsourcing. The case study demonstrates how generative AI can make participatory problem-solving with human participants more scalable and more effective because the tools make it possible to translate ideas into implementable proposals more quickly than human participation alone.\nThis study contributes to the body of research around collective intelligence for public problem-solving [Gambrell and Noveck 2020] as well as the use of AI for public good."}, {"title": "THE NEED FOR RAPID AND EFFICIENT PUBLIC PROBLEM-SOLVING", "content": "From climate change to economic instability and social inequality, to public health crises, policymakers and institutions face a range of urgent challenges. The ability to quickly identify, understand, and address these problems is crucial for maintaining societal stability and fostering sustainable progress. Yet, the mechanisms that institutions use to understand and address these challenges too often fail to develop and implement effective solutions at scale [Noveck 2021] [Mulgan 2017].\nThe rapid pace of societal advancement and technological change is deepening this challenge. Public institutions now work in increasingly complex and uncertain environments, with the world's growing interconnectivity making our challenges larger and more complex. The failure to develop effective solutions and create meaningful opportunities for communities to participate in solving problems may be contributing to a lack of trust in government [Kumagai and Iorio 2020]. In countries around the world, there is a broadly-held belief among members of the public that participating in elections - the most direct opportunity many residents have to influence public policy - simply does not matter [Van Reybrouck 2018]. There is a risk that the democratic backsliding that has been observed in the United States and other democracies will accelerate as people continue to see their governments as ineffective at solving problems that matter to them [Light 2014].\nFortunately, institutions around the world are experimenting with more participatory methods to solve problems, and in particular, to meaningfully incorporate the collective intelligence of communities and subject matter experts into their problem-solving processes. These include experiments that engage groups in lawmaking and policymaking at all levels of government [Noveck, et al. 2020] as well as efforts to institutionalize large-scale collaboration, crowdsourcing, and co- creation projects as part of institutions' formal problem-solving and decisionmaking processes [Ryan, et al. 2020]. As we will show, the rapid advance in technology most notably, the proliferation of generative AI tools presents great opportunities to further scale these efforts.\nIn the following section, we elaborate on one collective intelligence method \u2013 Smarter Crowdsourcing - that we have used to aid institutions in addressing problems and discuss the challenges to efficiently using collective intelligence for problem solving and then address how generative AI is helping to make this process more efficient and effective."}, {"title": "SMARTER CROWDSOURCING: RAPIDLY CROWDSOURCING EXPERTISE", "content": "Smarter Crowdsourcing is a problem-solving method that leverages the collective intelligence of diverse experts to identify solutions to urgent public problems in support of governments and philanthropic organizations [Dinesh 2023]. The process marries the diversity and agility of crowdsourcing with curation, to find and bring together those with relevant know-how and practical experience, in a format designed to produce the most innovative solutions to challenging public problems.\nSmarter Crowdsourcing was developed and tested for the first time in 2015 as part of an effort to advise the government of Quito, Ecuador about how to prepare for the eruption of the Cotopaxi Volcano. After this pilot, the methodology was further refined through a series of projects with other institutions. Following the Cotopaxi use case, the Smarter Crowdsourcing has been used seven additional times to support governments and philanthropic organizations:\n\u2022 Zika (2016): Explored ways to address the causes of Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases in support of the Inter-American Development Bank and partner governments in four countries in Latin America.\n\u2022 Anti-Corruption (2017): Worked with the Mexican government and civil society institutions to explore solutions to the problem of corruption in Mexico.\n\u2022 Coronavirus (2020): Supported the Inter-American Development Bank and its partner governments in Latin America and the Caribbean to source solutions to problems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022 Education (2020): Developed solutions to address the challenge of equitably identifying and measuring the non-academic skills young people need to succeed to inform the Walton Family Foundation's funding strategy.\n\u2022 Experiential Learning (2021): Explored innovations in equity-centered hands-on learning initiatives in support of Northeastern University.\n\u2022 Modernization of Congress (2021): Developed recommendations on evidence-based lawmaking in support of the US House Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.\n\u2022 Countering Election Subversion (2023): Developed recommendations for solutions philanthropy could support in order to counter efforts to undermine or cast doubt upon the integrity of U.S. elections in support of Democracy Fund Voice.\nIn each case, the process resulted in a set of practical and innovative solutions tailored to the partner institution's needs and priorities, in terms of format as well as content. For example, the Smarter Crowdsourcing: Education initiative described below generated 22 specific funding opportunities designed to have real-world positive impact, each one with a concrete action plan. These recommendations guided the strategic direction of the Walton Family Foundation's grantmaking portfolio in the area of non-academic skills assessment.\nSmarter Crowdsourcing was developed well before the use of generative AI tools became widespread, and thus was originally conceptualized as a process to rapidly crowdsource policy solutions from human experts. As shown in the use cases described in this section, combining this traditional crowdsourcing approach with an AI-driven innovation process (mediated by Policy Synth) results in a problem-solving approach that is both more scalable and more effective. We describe the traditional approach in this section, then introduce Policy Synth and explain the value of the augmented workflow that the AI-based toolkit enables.\nIn 2020, we used the Smarter Crowdsourcing method to advise the Walton Family Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 philanthropies which fund education projects in the United States \u2013 about their grantmaking strategy in the area of non-academic skills assessment in K-12 schools. Without generative AI tools, the process used the following three steps that are common to all of our Smarter Crowdsourcing experiments:"}, {"title": "Selecting and Defining the Problem", "content": "Based on a literature review and interviews with subject-matter experts, we developed a \"Problem Catalog.\" The Catalog identifies a series of problems that comprise the larger challenge of how to best assess non-academic skills, root causes, and example solutions. The foundation selected a subset of these problems to prioritize. Each problem became the focus of an online convening. Conducting interviews at this stage allows us to gather insights from the collective intelligence of half a dozen (sometimes more) experts, allowing us to understand the \"big picture\" of the problem at hand and what potential solutions might look like. However, identifying, interviewing and extracting learnings is time-consuming and the diversity of perspectives is limited."}, {"title": "Convening Experts to Identify Solutions", "content": "For each problem area selected by the foundation, we curated a list of 80-100 individuals who are experts, including credentialed experts as well as those with lived experience. These experts were identified through an extensive search of relevant literature as well as through recommendations from others working in the field.\nFor each problem identified by the foundation, we convened a 2-hour, moderated advisory session, using the videoconferencing platform Zoom, where the goal was to identify concrete and specific solutions. Between 25 and 35 experts participated in each convening; the group was curated so as to represent a diverse group of perspectives, including experts in academic curriculum development, psychometrics, career skills pathways, community engagement, and related fields. The conversations surfaced existing solutions as well as ideas for new projects and programs designed to address the problems identified. We ran six convenings, engaging more than 150 experts from six continents. Following each conversation, we spent 5-7 days creating a transcript based on the Zoom recording, writing notes, compiling resources shared, and synthesizing learnings, and then developed findings based on the participants' input.\nEngaging such large groups in structured deliberations offers the opportunity to rapidly gather insights, opinions, and new ideas for solutions from experts working on the problems at hand as well as those working in related domains. But there are also many design challenges involved in convening these participatory processes. There is the challenge of ensuring that the group convened has the expertise needed to generate on-topic and high-quality ideas. There is also a need to ensure that the group is diverse and reflects a range of identities, backgrounds and experiences. The conversation must be structured and facilitated in such a way that all participants are encouraged and provided the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the deliberation. Finally, there are logistical challenges, namely, the large amount of time and labor required to schedule, plan, create the inputs, moderate, and co-create the outputs from these large-group conversations."}, {"title": "Converting Insights into Action", "content": "Following the online convenings, the foundation selected a subset of solutions for further exploration. We conducted follow-up surveys, interviews, and research to create a set of recommendations for how to put each solution into action, including costs estimates, budgets, and metrics for evaluation. This step is crucial to ensure that the collective wisdom of the experts is channeled into outputs that are in the form and format that allows the partnering institution to take action upon them. However, converting the insights to action can bring challenges. In past projects, it has taken 3-6 months of research to return final recommendations to the partnering institution. Conducting surveys and interviews and translating the findings from those engagements into detailed memos and reports is simply a laborious and time-consuming process."}, {"title": "COMBINING AI AND CI TO SOLVE PROBLEMS COLLABORATIVELY AT SCALE", "content": "As shown in the steps above, the typical expert-informed problem-solving process is both time-consuming and labor- intensive. While the Smarter Crowdsourcing approach is designed for efficiency, there is a significant workload involved in conducting research about problems and solutions, curating and convening experts, and synthesizing solutions.\nWith the release of GPT-4, new possibilities have emerged for leveraging AI and CI together to solve problems more effectively. GPT-4's advanced language understanding, generation capabilities, and ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data have opened up new avenues for integrating AI into collective problem-solving processes. By harnessing the power of GPT-4 and similar Al models, we can enhance the capacity of human groups to generate ideas, evaluate solutions, and make informed decisions.\nAs described in the following section, Policy Synth helps to solve problems more rapidly by automating many of the research and writing tasks, while providing opportunities for the human guides to provide input throughout the process to ensure the outputs are aligned with the institutions' needs."}, {"title": "WHAT IS POLICY SYNTH?", "content": "Policy Synth is a toolkit designed to automate and scale up the Smarter Crowdsourcing method by seamlessly integrating collective and artificial intelligence. It builds upon the proven success of Smarter Crowdsourcing, which engages the collective intelligence of human experts to solve public problems, by incorporating AI capabilities to enhance the process. Policy Synth leverages artificial intelligence techniques and genetic algorithms to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing method more efficient, effective, and scalable, enabling institutions to develop solutions more rapidly than would be possible with human intelligence alone. The toolkit is built as a JavaScript class-based library, providing a framework for creating Al agent logic flows, application programming interfaces (APIs), and state-of-the-art real-time AI-focused web applications, all designed to streamline and optimize the problem-solving process.\nOur goal in creating Policy Synth is to provide institutions access to a set of easy-to-use tools and methods that will increase their ability to solve urgent problems and provide a model process for how institutions can meaningfully engage communities in the problem-solving process."}, {"title": "SMARTER CROWDSOURCING WITH POLICY SYNTH", "content": "The Smarter Crowdsourcing process is designed to channel the collective intelligence of those with expertise about a problem into actionable solutions through curation and convening. In this section, we outline how artificial intelligence can accelerate this process, helping us generate more and better solutions, faster.\nAs described above, Policy Synth is an AI-based toolkit that accelerates and improves the process of searching for, evolving, ranking, and helping to prioritize among both problems and solutions. Policy Synth augments the stages Smarter Crowdsourcing process as follows:"}, {"title": "Selecting and Defining the Problem", "content": "Policy Synth accelerates the problem definition phase by automating much of the process of searching for and prioritizing among constituent problems.\nThe tool is first populated with a \"problem statement\" a short paragraph that describes the challenge that the tool is tasked with \"solving.\" The platform will then use AI to automatically: 1) Create a set of queries - questions or phrases that it will plug into a search engine to search for root causes of the problem, 2) Generate a list of problems based on the search of thousands of online sources, and 3) Assign each problem a rating and rank them. The problems are ranked by a set of criteria specified by the user, combined with Elo scoring (See detailed description of the ranking process in the section of this study on \"Elo Pairwise Voting.\u201d). Once the search and ranking are complete, the tool delivers a list of problems along with the web pages that were scanned in order to identify them.\nArtificial intelligence allows us to automatically search a wider range of sources than would be possible through traditional research methods, and to conduct this search more rapidly."}, {"title": "Convening Experts to Identify Solutions", "content": "Policy Synth augments the process of identifying solutions, both by aiding in the process of identifying experts to invite to participate in the online convenings, and by automatically developing a separate set of solutions in parallel.\nFirst, Policy Synth can be used to automatically generate a list of solutions in the problem areas of greatest priority. The tool will search the web for solutions that respond to the problems identified previously. After generating hundreds of solutions, Policy Synth will remove any duplicate solutions and filter out the solutions that are not viable. Next, the tool will evolve the solutions using a genetic algorithm. The software combines multiple solutions into one, and then tests how well the new version of the solution fits the problem to see if the improvement should be adopted or rejected. After multiple rounds of crossovers, mutations and ranking, Policy Synth produces a final list of approaches tailored to addressing the problem. (See detailed description of the genetic algorithm in the \"Evolutionary Algorithm\" section of this study)\nThis process produces a list of solutions for each identified problem, in an easily readable format with a list of pros and cons for each solution. Each solution is accompanied by a visual illustration from Dalle-3 or other Al image-generation tools.\nSecond, the toolkit's search functionalities can also accelerate the process of identifying experts to engage in the process of identifying solutions. The list of sources returned by the online searches for problems and solutions \u2013 which may include online journal articles, white papers, news reports, and items from other types of online publications can be useful for identifying those with credentialed expertise and live experience in each problem area, included those who have developed or proposed solutions. For example, the authors of those sources, those cited in reference pages, or mentioned as experts in the text could be included in the list of experts who are invited to contribute solutions. Thus, Policy Synth can help to search for experts more quickly and to cast a wider net compared to manual online searches, yielding more diverse expertise."}, {"title": "Converting Insights into Action", "content": "Finally, Policy Synth augments the process of converting ideas into actionable recommendations. Using seed ideas (for example, the solutions identified in the previous step, or solutions identified by the human experts), the toolkit will generate policy proposals based on an online search, then rank and evolve the proposals using a genetic algorithm. This process leverages large-scale web research to search for policy evidence across 22 categories, which is then provided in an easy-"}, {"title": "Aligning Partner Institutions' Priorities with Communities' Expertise", "content": "In line with the need to tailor the outputs of the problem-solving process to institutions' needs, each stage of Policy Synth is highly customizable.\nThe instructions used to search for and rank the problems, solutions, or policy proposals are customizable based on the priorities, constraints, and desires of each institutional partner. For example, the instructions could be tailored to prioritize problems that disproportionately impact women or African Americans, to encourage solutions that can be implemented quickly, or to favor policy proposals that can be implemented within the partner institution's jurisdiction.\nThe outputs produced at each stage can also be manually reviewed and edited. For example, if the system identifies a problem that the partner institution deems outside of its mandate, the problem can be deactivated so that it is not considered when solutions are identified.\nWhile the experiment described in this study focuses on Policy Synth's potential to enhance problem-solving efforts involving groups of experts, the process can be augmented to incorporate input from other groups. The toolkit can be used alongside online engagement tools to combine the collective intelligence of multiple groups. For example, All Our Ideas - the \"Wiki Survey\" tool described in the Elo Ranking and Pairwise Voting section of this study \u2013 could be used to engage communities in ranking and prioritizing among problems generated during the Selecting and Defining the Problem section of the problem-solving process. Or, the open source Your Priorities platform could be leveraged to engage communities in a large-scale online dialogue about which solutions to prioritize for implementation. The ability to integrate community input is crucial to ensure that the solutions developed and supported by partnering institutions respond to real and urgent problems that communities experience."}, {"title": "Novelty of Approach", "content": "Combining artificial intelligence and collective intelligence in itself is not new; numerous toolkits have been developed which aim to combine CI and AI processes to rapidly develop solutions to public problems [Baeck and Berditchevskaia. 2020].\nIn existing approaches, AI is largely viewed as a tool to enhance collective intelligence processes, such as dialogues, deliberations, and crowdsourcing efforts. There are several existing platforms which leverage Al to make sense of and draw insights from large volumes of data to gauge communities' opinions on a given topic. These include toolkits designed to aid in analyzing and drawing findings from large-scale online engagements with communities [Rahim, et al. 2024] as well as platforms to synthesize learnings from rich in-person dialogues [Local Voices Network. 2022]. There is also a set of tools and approaches in which Al is used as a tool to facilitate large-scale online deliberations and dialogues [Konya, et al. 2023] [Mendes, et al. 2019] [Moats and Tseng. 2023] [Rosenberg, et al. 2023]. In various ways, these approaches endeavor to use AI to improve the outcomes of engagements with groups, whether by enabling engagement with larger groups, improving the efficiency or quality of analysis, or by enabling more coherent or higher quality deliberations and collective dialogues.\nWhile recognizing the value of these methods, Policy Synth takes a different approach. In addition to being a practical tool for policymakers, Policy Synth serves as a demonstration how AI can be used to synthesize the learnings from deliberations (and other types of CI processes) together with findings from research to develop evidence-based policy solutions systematically.

We convened online convenings to crowdsource solutions to three of these problems. The philanthropy then selected the two highest priority problem areas for further research. The first area, Misuse of the Legal System, aimed to address the malicious use of litigation and freedom of information (FOI) requests to disrupt election administration and cast doubt upon the validity of election results. The second area, Election-Related Violence, aimed to surface strategies to mitigate the effectiveness of political violence targeting elections.

While there is some debate over to what extent LLMs are capable of semantic understanding, it is clear that significant shortcomings remain when it comes to LLMs' ability to understand logic and meaning in context, as is required to engage in complex comparisons [Wu, et al. 2024] [Yan, et al. 2024].\nFurther, basing the evaluation primarily on the number of similar statements does not capture the whole picture. As described above, there may be value in both statements that are similar to those generated by experts (as validation for the AI approach) and those that are dissimilar (for assessing the novelty or added value of the AI approach). This nuance may not be well-captured by our evaluation metrics.\nWe plan to conduct a future experiment, the design of which will address these limitations. The experiment will leverage human reviewers, in addition to LLMs, to evaluate the solutions.\nWe will also compare the similarity between the LLM evaluations of the solutions and the human evaluations to better understand how well LLMs can provide this role at scale.

However, there have always been strategies to mitigate the fact that Al models are \"weak learners.\" This insight has been crucial, steering us towards strategies that enhance the performance of current generation AI tools. These strategies include always simplifying tasks for large language models (LLMs) as much as possible, breaking complex \"thoughts\" into simpler \"thoughts\", employing pairwise ranking for efficient selection, and incorporating review loops for iterative refinement.\nAnother inspiration was a thought-provoking piece in The Economist, \"It's not just a fiscal fiasco: graying economies also innovate less,\" which underlined the importance of \"fluid intelligence\" a concept in psychology which describes \"the general ability to reason, to flexibly engage with the world, to recognize patterns, and to solve problems in a manner"}, {"title": "About Al Agents", "content": "Al agents are a key component of Policy Synth's approach to System 2 thinking (described below).

These algorithms work by mimicking the process of natural evolution, employing mechanisms such as selection, mutation, and crossover (recombination) to evolve a population of candidate solutions towards an optimal solution over generations. Initially, a diverse population of possible solutions is generated. Through the iterative process of selecting the fittest individuals based on a defined fitness function and applying genetic operators like crossover and mutation to produce offspring, the algorithm seeks to improve the population's overall quality. Over successive generations, the population evolves, and ideally, a solution emerges that is close to the optimum for the problem at hand.\nIn Policy Synth, the genetic algorithm is a versatile tool, utilized for various aspects of policy development. The evolutionary aspect of Policy Synth is manifested in its ability to not just find ideas but also to develop them further. By applying an Elo-based pairwise voting system, the most effective solutions are identified and carried forward. Ideas that are not viable are pruned, while promising ones are enhanced through pros and cons analysis, further refined through successive generations of mutation and crossover within the algorithm.\nIncorporating human judgment is also a key aspect, allowing the genetic algorithm to tailor its fitness function to human preferences and societal requirements.

The costs for such operations can range significantly, from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars. However, it's worth- noting that since the start of the Policy Synth project in June 2023, there has been a substantial reduction in these expenses, approximately 75%. Continuous efforts are made to optimize the code to ensure minimal expenditure without compromising the quality of outcomes and the cost of advanced AI models keeps on going down."}, {"title": "Future Directions: Research and Impact", "content": "As Al development continues to accelerate, it stands as one of the most significant opportunities for society to address the challenges of information overload and the often-paralyzing uncertainty about the future. By effectively managing and making sense of the deluge of data available, AI can help policymakers navigate complex societal challenges with greater confidence. Moving forward, the promise of AI-enhanced governance extends beyond improved efficiency and inclusivity in decision-making. It harbors the potential for more stable politics, where informed and participatory governance can reduce societal anxiety about the future. Through the judicious integration of AI in the policy-making process, we can aspire to a future characterized by not only more effective government action but also by a more engaged and reassured public, confident in the resilience and adaptability of their political systems to meet emerging challenges head-on.\nAnother consideration is how to account for invisible biases. These may include the risk of replicating biases in existing literature, and additional biases introduced by LLM agents in their rating, prioritization, and summarization of research. Future experiments will explore how potential biases in our approach can be better identified and accounted for."}, {"title": "Future Directions: Technical", "content": "Looking forward, the Policy Synth project plans to undertake significant further developments. Already released in 2024, we have devised a new framework for a chatbot utilizing Policy Synth agents. This framework aims to establish automated data ingestion pipelines, aligning with the foundational principles of Policy Synth to enhance process efficiency and broaden the project's scope. Policy Synth Engineer, an automatic programming solution for Typescript projects, has entered the early stages of development, already completing GitHub tickets fully autonomously, and is estimated to help scale up future development pace of Policy Synth considerably.\nIncorporating insights from biology, particularly Michael Levin's work [Lagasse and Levin. 2023] [Watson and Levin. 2023], offers a nuanced perspective on computational models. Levin's and others research into bioelectric phenomena and multi-scale collective intelligence parallels some of the adaptability of biological systems with the structured yet flexible framework of Policy Synth's multiscale agents and genetic algorithms. While both systems exhibit a level of adaptability and complexity, a key difference emerges in the goal-driven behavior of biological agents compared to the more task- oriented focus of Policy Synth agents. This distinction prompts a research question: Can some ideas related to the goal- driven principles observed in multi-scale biological intelligence be integrated into Policy Synth's computational LLM agents to enhance their functionality?"}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "In the progression from our institutional experience with collective intelligence projects that did not have the input and assistance of AI, to our work on Policy Synth, one clear and obvious outcome of integrating AI is increased efficiency. Al helped us to summarize and extract the learnings from two hours of simultaneous talking and typing in minutes, rather than days. Al enabled research of inputs on a topic and assembling of source documents for the human agents to consider almost instantly, reducing the expense of these \"back office\" research work that these sorts of projects would incur if they did not have Al assistance.\nThe integration of humans and AI in decision-making processes represents a promising path for enhancing governmental decision-making. By harnessing the capabilities of AI through platforms like Policy Synth, there is a unique opportunity to process vast amounts of data, enabling more informed, equitable, and participatory decision-making. The collaborative synergy between human intuition and AI's analytical prowess can lead to increasingly sophisticated insights"}, {"title": "ETHICS", "content": "Policy Synth embodies a principled approach to Al development, prioritizing human-centric design, collaboration and inclusivity, open-source and nonprofit principles.

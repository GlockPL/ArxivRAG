{"title": "Expanding AI Awareness Through Everyday Interactions with AI: A Reflective Journal Study", "authors": ["Ashish Hingle", "Aditya Johri"], "abstract": "This research paper presents findings from a reflective journal study of undergraduate students' everyday interactions with artificial intelligence (AI). As the application of AI continues to expand, students in technology programs are poised to be both producers and users of the technologies. They are also positioned to engage with AI applications within and outside the classroom. While focusing on the curriculum when examining students' Al knowledge is common, extending this connection to students' everyday interactions with AI provides a more complete picture of their learning. In this paper, we explore student's awareness and engagement with AI in the context of school and their daily lives. Over six weeks, 22 undergraduate students participated in a reflective journal study and submitted a weekly journal entry about their interactions with AI. The participants were recruited from a technology and society course that focuses on the implications of technology on people, communities, and processes. In their weekly journal entries, participants reflected on interactions with AI on campus (coursework, advertises campus events, or seminars) and beyond (social media, news, or conversations with friends and family). The journal prompts were designed to help them think through what they had read, watched, or been told and reflect on the development of their own perspectives, knowledge, and literacy on the topic. Overall, students described nine categories of interactions: coursework, news and current events, using software and applications, university events, social media related to their work, personal discussions with friends and family, interacting with content, and gaming. Students reported that completing the diaries allowed them time for reflection and made them more aware of the presence of AI in their daily lives and of its potential benefits and drawbacks. This research contributes to the ongoing work on Al awareness and literacy by bringing in perspectives from beyond a formal educational context.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications are becoming increasingly common across domains with significant influence over societal functions, including dynamic pricing of consumer goods, search results, and how dependent future learners are on tools [1]\u2013[3]. Some examples of our everyday interactions with AI include \"recommender systems, customer service chatbots, search engine algorithms, smart assistants, digital self-tracking services, etc.\" [4, p. 127]. While they may take many forms, the growing prevalence of AI systems highlights the importance of developing an AI-aware and literate population, especially using a \"high-level understanding\u201d as a baseline for the general population [5]. Developing AI awareness is especially important for current students, given it will likely affect their day-to-day interactions. Leveraging students' personal experiences as educational tools can ef- fectively enhance their understanding of AI. While formal AI education programs are increasingly being developed to reach a wider audience, exploring and incorporating informal interactions with AI technologies is important to provide a more comprehensive understanding [5], [6].\nThis study explores students' self-reflections on their inter- actions with AI by bridging their in-class experiences through a technology ethics course with their informal interactions with everyday AI. We implemented a weekly reflective journal for undergraduate technology students, asking them to document and reflect on their interactions with AI over six weeks. The theoretical framing for this work is based on prior work on computing and technology students learning through formal and informal activities [7], [8] and the use of journals for student self-reflection on AI interactions [9]. The research questions guiding this study, which were developed through reviewing categorizations of AI and their use [10]\u2013[12], were:\n1) RQ1: Which everyday interactions with AI are salient for students in the classroom and outside?\n2) RQ2: How did students perceive the process of reflecting on AI interactions?"}, {"title": "II. RELEVANT PRIOR WORK", "content": "The field of education has been profoundly impacted by everyday AI, particularly through its integration into routine and often subtle daily interactions for learners and educators alike [4], [13]. As researchers work to define and integrate AI learning, considerable research has been dedicated to exploring Al concepts, methods of implementation, and assessment approaches. Several reviews have addressed Al literacy (or similar constructs questioning what people need to know about AI) in education contexts and have highlighted the state of the teaching and learning landscape over the last few years [10], [14]\u2013[16]. Quantitative AI literacy instruments are also increasingly common across these constructs. Despite a variety of framings, the literature consistently differentiates between technical and non-technical AI skills, emphasizing the importance of understanding how AI works and addressing the societal implications of AI systems [12], [17].\nWhile AI learning initiatives increase, there is room for fur- ther discussion connecting students' learning in the classroom to activities beyond. Students' understanding of what AI is and how it affects them may be of concern [18]. Researchers have attempted to make these connections apparent through various interventions. Ali et al. developed a card game that describes uses of Al that could be familiar to learners and focuses on having students actively think about the harms caused by AI systems and ways to mitigate them [19]. Kasinidou et al. de- scribe a course implemented at the Open University of Cyprus that included eight units addressing various Al applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, ethics, and living with AI [11]. These initiatives integrate learning experiences, and more research must explore how students engage and learn from AI in the wild.\nInformal interactions with AI are gaining traction as an effective means to educate the public about AI concepts outside traditional classroom settings. These activities can include efforts to connect to everyday practices and settings to make Al knowledge accessible and engaging [20]. A study by Long et al. highlights the importance of incorporating creative and embodied interactions in informal learning spaces, such as museum exhibits, to foster interest in AI and computing- related topics [5]. The study proposes design principles for informal settings, emphasizing collaboration and creativity in making AI concepts relatable and understandable. By inte- grating informal learning activities, these programs can reach a broader audience, thus helping to demystify AI and make it more accessible to the general public [21]."}, {"title": "B. Student Reflection and Journals for Informal Learning", "content": "Student reflection activities are defined broadly across the literature as creating space to think through questions, ponder alternatives, and synthesize knowledge meaningfully for the learner. Clar\u00e0 highlights a central component from Dewey's earlier work (1933) of reflection to include observations and inferences: \"Observation operates by means of facts, the objective events of a situation, what Dewey sometimes calls conditions or data, whereas inference is a jump beyond these observed events, it is an act of imagination, a supposition or hypothesis, what Dewey sometimes calls suggestion or idea.\" [22, p. 265]. For students, the reflection can involve strategies to help them think like a professional in their field by bridging their experiences with how they think of the profession and learning about it [23]. Navigating what was experienced, grappling with the possibilities, mulling through alternative paths, and building informed opinions is a significant portion of the reflective experience.\nResearchers have explored the effectiveness of reflection by analyzing the key components that constitute high-quality reflective practices. Lin et al. describe three processes in reflective thinking and designing technology-based environ- ments that support reflection: \"reflection 1) involves social interactions; 2) is an active, intentional, and purposeful process of exploration, discovery, and learning; and 3) involves under- standing one's process of learning\" [24]. These definitions can be mapped to Chickering and Gamson's seminal text on The Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Educa- tion. Reflection can be an active learning activity (Principle 3), provide students the temporal opportunity to spend time on the task (Principle 5), and engage the diverse talents of the learner by allowing for a variety of media in the reflection (Principle 7). By constructing reflection through this lens and focusing on an appropriate level of reflection, i.e., simulated, descriptive, dialogic, or critical [25], learners can be given structure even in an exercise that can seem fluid.\nReflective activities can take various forms: in class, outside, or based on assignments, for example. Reflective journals are one such data collection technique that allows researchers to collect data from participants over time as they happen. They are similar in structure to diary studies. Carter and Mankoff describe feedback studies, where the participants respond to predefined questions, and elicitation studies, where partici- pants capture thoughts through writing and media, which can be used in the post-study follow-up [26]. The data is collected while not directly involved with the participants to minimize the effects of being observed in the way an interview may influence engagement. Journal studies are a significant time and effort activity for participants, and it is encouraged to provide compensation for the engagement.\nSome researchers have used reflective activities specifically within the context of algorithmic literacy and technology awareness. Koenig describes using reflective student media journals to have communication students reflect on their engagements with algorithms [9]. Students were prompted to explore their algorithmic influences and literacy through everyday activities. Koenig highlights students moving toward more rhetorical and critical discussions through their media journals by exploring basic, rhetorical, and critical awareness through the journals. \"As my results suggest, because the students were asked to write journal entries on this topic, they were required to not just consider their actions, but turn those actions into words. Because they were asked to examine those patterns of use and their own role in creating those patterns, students gained critical and rhetorical understanding of their engagements\" (pg. 11)."}, {"title": "III. METHOD", "content": "In this study, participants submitted their thoughts, percep- tions, and opinions on their interactions with AI through a reflective journal. Participants completed one reflective journal entry weekly for six consecutive weeks, starting in October 2023 and ending in November 2023. The journals were collected as part of a more extensive study on students' everyday AI interactions. The primary methodology used a feedback approach to elicit participants' descriptions of their interactions with AI. However, due to the open-ended nature of the prompts, which encouraged thorough and expansive responses, an elicitation component was also incorporated [26].\nParticipants were provided with weekly prompts designed to center the discussion around interactions broadly with AI. Par- ticipants were encouraged to describe the formal (structured, sequential, repressive, and compulsory learning that is teacher- led and assessed), non-formal (occurs outside of the school and is also structured but is non-sequential, non-repressive, and voluntary learning that teachers may guide), and informal (unstructured, spontaneous, and usually learner-led, allowing the learner to decide when and how it occurs) interactions [27]. The prompts given to students were inspired by broad categorizations of AI explored through recent AI literacy systematic literature reviews [10], [14], [16]. Specifically, students were instructed to submit a journal entry in response to the following prompt:\n1) 1. In the last week, document where and about what you have noticed mention about artificial intelligence (AI):\na) at your campus (advertised events, courses you are taking, campus news, or guest speakers) or\nb) outside of your campus (your social media, local or international news, conversations with family)?\n2) Was the way AI was described leave you with a positive, negative, or neutral impression? Why or why not?\nWe chose to undertake this research as a qualitative study with a comprehensive approach to capture a range of student responses. This decision reflects the novelty of investigating informal learning activities among technology and computing students, particularly in light of recent advancements in AI, such as LLMs, that have significantly increased the acces- sibility of consumer-facing AI. Reviewing the literature, we found few studies exploring how students reflect on their interactions with Al in and outside the classroom. However, our methodology follows guidelines for conducting research from similar approaches [7], [8]."}, {"title": "A. The Course", "content": "Students were recruited to participate from a technology ethics course hosted by a College of Engineering and Com- puting at a large, public university in the Southeastern United States. The course covers the social implications of new tech- nology. Students learn about how technology affects systems on an individual, national, and global scale. The course is structured into several modules, consistently focusing through- out the 16-week semester on societal implications, ethics, and values in the design and experience of an interconnected world. The course brings students from various disciplines together and addresses ABET Accreditation Outcome 3 on Student Outcomes."}, {"title": "B. Participants", "content": "Twenty-two (22) students were recruited from the course to participate in this study in October 2023. Participants ranged from 19 to 32 years old and completed between 40 and 121 university credits. Eleven (11) participants self-described their gender as female, and eleven (11) participants self-described as male. The majority of the students were full-time, working towards a BS in Information Technology with a variety of specializations.\nParticipants were provided a $48 gift card for completing the six journal entries. No course credit was offered for participating, and deciding not to participate did not impact course outcomes."}, {"title": "C. Analysis", "content": "Twenty-two participants completed and submitted a total of 132 reflective journal entries - each student completed 6 jour- nal entries over the course of 6 weeks. The authors analyzed the student reflections through an emergent analysis method to explore a broad perspective on the discourse students entered in their journals, similar to the analysis framing highlighted in [9]. The authors read through the journal entries and free-coded the journal entries, from which a set of emergent themes and subthemes were identified. Initially, this resulted in 15 themes, and after discussing the codes in each, rereading and identifying collapsible codes, and ensuring saturation was reached, a final set of 9 themes was created (Table I)."}, {"title": "IV. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "In addressing RQ1, we explore the interactions students described in their weekly journal entries. The analysis revealed the emergence of 9 themes. While frequency is one method of understanding these interactions, it is important to recognize the significance of those interactions with fewer instances, as they highlight the ways in which students engage with the sub- ject matter across formal, informal, and non-formal contexts. more details for the themes in the following sections and how students explored the aspects of their learning."}, {"title": "A. Which everyday interactions with AI are salient for students in the classroom and outside? (RQ1)", "content": "Participants primarily focused their reflections on the course discussions when describing their interac- tions throughout the week. This observation could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the course held a central position within the study design; it was the formal learning component and where the students were recruited from. Secondly, the nature of the prompt likely influenced this inclination, as it encouraged participants to view the course as a potential locus of interaction. This approach was deliberately crafted to ensure that all participants would have something to draw upon during a slow week.\nAcross the journal entries, the most common reflection was by participants discussing what was raised in the course and reflecting on what they had learned. Participant 18 described discussing the topic of deep fakes in a structured way in the classroom and used the journal to build on both the benefits and the problems of the technology:"}, {"title": "1) Coursework:", "content": "With these types of reflections about the course materials, the timeliness and relevance beyond the classroom of the course discussion became apparent. Deepfakes are a visual form of disinformation that can affect cognitive outcomes, reduce trust in news on social media, and generate uncertainty [28]. Though not initially dubbed an everyday interaction, the ease of developing and deploying these systems has grown exponentially, and participants were generally concerned about how these might alter social dynamics.\nThis pattern of Al's societal implications was common across the course learning. Participant 6 reflects on not just learning about the problem but the types of solutions emerging from the discussion:"}, {"title": "2) News and Current Events:", "content": "Participants often raised news and current events through relevant articles at the time of data collection (October-November 2023). These came from both formal and informal spaces; sometimes, the articles were referenced as part of their coursework, but in other cases, the news or current events were described in the wild.\nFor example, Participant 11 writes about coming across discourse on regulations for responsible AI use after becoming primed to the conversation through course discussions:\nThe reflection on regulations across AI development is not new but was ever-present across the journals. Most Americans already support oversight and regulation in the ways the technology is used [29]. Having students engage with the discussion and arrive at their own consensus is a reflective exercise.\nDiscussions about the negatives were also tempered with the positive as some students engaged with a positive lens on the uses of AI. Participant 5 described positive news about AI and how it felt out of place in the larger discussion of news and current events:\nThe article linked by the participant focused on predicting climate shifts when facing extreme weather and explored the differences between traditional and machine learning methods, highlighting the ability to work with complex data [30]. The participant came across this article on their own and built their understanding of the foundations of what was discussed in the course.\nRegarding a news piece about the UN's role in addressing AI, Participant 7 projects the ideas presented through the article on the past, exploring the implications on the impact of people:"}, {"title": "3) Using Software and Applications:", "content": "Reflections of in- teractions with software and applications emerged frequently and highlighted participants' navigating learning about AI while using it. Participant 19 highlights their engagements with Spotify to recommend new artists and music:\nThough not explicitly highlighted, the recommendations are aligned with musical taste preferences based on previous usage.

In the following week's journal, Participant 19 highlights their search for recommendations on Instagram when visiting a new place:"}, {"title": "4) University Events:", "content": "Universities throughout the US are embracing various approaches to incorporate artificial intel- ligence into their teaching and learning frameworks. A pre- vailing trend across institutions involves establishing programs and events designed to expose students to AI concepts during their time as students. Following this trend, the institution where the participating students were recruited has imple- mented several initiatives, including guest speaker events, fireside chats, and hackathons to foster engagement with AI among its student body. As Participant 17 describes, the levels across discussion can range and can serve as motivation (or potentially barriers) for non-formal learning:\nWhile some students found these events useful, others, such as Participant 21, highlight what might come off as performative organization or following buzzwords:\nUltimately, university events serve as non-formal events that can introduce and inspire students. Engaging meaningfully is fundamental to ensure students are making the most of the experience."}, {"title": "5) Through Social Media:", "content": "Participants described social media as a significant source of information for them.

Participant 6 raised the discussion about how Al is described broadly:\nMany of the participants scrutinized the benefits and costs of AI systems. As Participant 6 described, these feelings of navigating perceptions about the tools:\nIn exploring the feedback, students had different expec- tations, experiences, and desires with AI. For some, the convenience factor was the ultimate decider to their attitude toward AI. Participant 19 sums this up with:"}, {"title": "B. How did students perceive the process of reflecting on AI interactions? (RQ2)", "content": "In addressing RQ2, we asked the participants to complete a short survey at the end of the reflective journal data collection."}, {"title": "V. LIMITATIONS", "content": "While this study provides valuable insights into expanding AI awareness through student's daily interactions with AI, it is important to acknowledge the limitations that may have influenced the results and interpretations. One of the primary limitations is the participants in this study were all pursuing a technology degree, which could have influenced their interac- tions with AI. This shared educational background likely pro- vided them with a baseline understanding of technology and its applications. Consequently, their familiarity with technological concepts and systems might have shaped their responses and engagement with AI in ways that may not be representative of a broader population.\nSecondly, the emergent analysis methodology provides a flexible and adaptive way to explore qualitative data such as those collected through the reflective journal, but may lack the structured rigor of more predefined analytical frameworks, which is normal among studies of this style.\nFinally, implementing this activity without the use of in- centives may be challenging to do. In this study, incentives were provided for students' efforts to complete the reflective journals. The design of the study can be incorporated into a course through a graded assignment, but special attention would need to be given to the quality of responses."}, {"title": "VI. FUTURE WORK", "content": "Thinking forward, this study highlights several important findings that can contribute to the direction of future work and instructional design. Firstly, interactions on campus through both formal and informal activities are an important mech- anism for students to be exposed to conversations about AI and can supplement their learning in the classroom in a semi- structured way. However, the quality of engagements in this way is important.\nSecondly, participants described interaction with media in content and gaming, highlighting areas that have largely not been explored in designing curriculum. It is important to note that these categories, even the less frequent interactions, were highly influential on many participants' perspectives toward AI. Some courses take advantage of popular culture themes, highlighting, for example, how students can learn about ethical speculation by having students participate in the Black Mirror Writers Room [32]. Therefore, there is an opportunity to continue developing interesting activities aligning with topics students are excited about. However, this type of activity requires additional instructor effort and training [33], [34] and design of programs and courses that effectively integrate AI related knowledge."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "Allowing students to reflect on their interactions with AI in a context beyond the classroom is important to ensure they build a holistic perspective. Using reflective journals as an unstructured learning activity is one way to have students do this reflection. Incorporating informal activities serves to an- chor students' formal classroom learning experiences. Through reflection and integrating their individual perspectives, stu- dents demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of AI and connect it more broadly to other ideas. Moreover, informal learning approaches in AI provide a structured framework while accommodating flexibility, fostering an environment conducive to student-driven learning.\nThe participants in the study described nine distinct cat- egories of interactions, spanning coursework, engagement with news and current events, utilization of software and applications, attendance at university events, involvement in social media platforms, work-related interactions, personal discussions with peers and family members, engagement with content, and participation in gaming activities. Through the reflection process, it became evident that students experienced heightened awareness regarding the prevalence of AI in their daily routines, along with a deeper understanding of its in- herent strengths and limitations, as facilitated by the practice of journaling and reflecting on their interactions. Furthermore, students underscored the significance of the diary completion process, emphasizing its role in affording them valuable time for introspection and contemplation."}, {"title": "VIII.

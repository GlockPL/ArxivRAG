Furthermore, Malta has a rapid vehicle\ngrowth. Based on our research, the number of vehicles increased\nby around 11,000 in a little more than 6 months, which shows how\nimportant it is to have an accurate and comprehensive means of\ncollecting data to tackle the issue of fluctuating traffic in Malta. In\nthis paper, we first present the newly built comprehensive traffic\ndataset, called MalTra. This dataset includes realistic trips made\nby members of the public across the island over a period of 200\ndays.

However, transportation growth leads to prob-\nlems that, in the case of densely populated areas, result in\nother problems such as increased air pollution and traffic\ncongestion, especially during rush hours. Through the use\nof modern technology, traffic forecasting solutions are being\nthoroughly sought after in hopes of improving the efficiency of\nmass movement from one destination to another. This is being\nachieved through the use of different forms of sensors, such\nas street-level cameras and GPS data collected from public\ntransport.\nThe widespread adoption of mobile devices has enabled\nthe continuous, implicit and instantaneous collection of vast\namounts of data, ushering in a new era of data-driven in-\nsights. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"big data,\" has\nsignificant implications for traffic analysis and prediction, as\nit allows for the collection of detailed spatio-temporal data\nat an unprecedented scale. According to Zhou et al. [44],\nthe integration of data from mobile devices and sensors into\nintelligent transportation systems offers a unique opportunity\nto uncover hidden patterns and trends through advanced data\nanalysis techniques. These patterns, which might not be appar-\nent through traditional data collection methods, are crucial for\ndeveloping more accurate and responsive traffic management\nstrategies.\nUsing the vast amounts of data generated by mobile devices,\nresearchers can address both known and unknown variables\nin traffic behaviour, leading to more robust and predictive\nmodels. As described by Li et al. (2018), analyzing large-\nscale traffic datasets enables the identification of previously\nunrecognized relationships and trends, thus enhancing the pre-\ndictive power of traffic models [2]. This approach underscores\nthe importance of big data analytics in transforming raw data\ninto actionable insights for intelligent transportation systems.\nThe ubiquity of devices and their adoption across the popu-\nlation allows for a new phenomenon of collecting information\nimplicitly, continuously, and instantly, from mobile devices.\nFurthermore, having such voluminous data stored in the palm\nof our hands, it is possible to discover unknown patterns and\ntrends by analysing and processing such information.\nIn this regard, the information collected in real time from\nmobile data users has been used to address the problem of\ntraffic analysis [19] in Malta, which is the most densely\npopulated country in the EU with about 1,672 inhabitants per\nsquare kilometre and an ever increasing number of vehicles.\nThe Maltese National Statistics Office (NSO) reported an\naverage increase of 29 vehicles per day for 2021 [15].\nTraffic prediction was investigated by [8], who evaluated the\nprevious traffic states of a particular location over a period of\ntime and considered these states as data to forecast the duration\nof the same respective location. Data-driven approaches are\ncommonly adopted by researchers to address such a problem,\nthus requiring historical data for prediction.\nPredicting traffic is however, complicated and is consid-\nered a nontrivial problem as it presents several challenges.\nFirstly, traffic flow [9] is intricate as it is influenced by\nnumerous variables, such as weather, road conditions, road\nnetwork design, and human behaviour, which can rapidly\nand unpredictably change. Secondly, obtaining precise data\n[11] can be difficult since traffic data collection methods can\nbe limited and expensive, and crowd-sourced data may be\nunreliable. Additionally, traffic prediction models often require\ndata from multiple sources that are challenging to integrate due\nto varying data formats and quality levels.\nThe modelling of traffic prediction approaches can also\nbe complicated, requiring significant computational resources,\nand selecting the best approach for a specific situation can"}, {"title": "II. MOTIVATIONS AND CHALLENGES", "content": "This research highlights traffic-related challenges in Malta,\nwhich can be addressed using geolocation data in traffic man-\nagement systems, directly or indirectly alleviating congestion.\nThe focus of the research is on traffic patterns in general,\nfollowed by investigating the local Maltese sphere to predict\nthe time spent on roads during a user's journey from their\norigin to the final destination.\nThe primary objective of this research is to develop a\nmodel capable of extracting insights from historical data (both\nspatial and temporal) to accurately predict the duration of\ntravel on specific road segments or sensor points. To this end,\nvarious traffic patterns will be analysed, and these insights\nwill be applied to the locally constructed dataset, facilitating\nthe generation of precise traffic flow predictions. This research\nexplores the hypothesis that graph-based neural networks can\neffectively predict the duration of traffic flow in Malta, offering\na robust solution to the island's traffic challenges.\nTo achieve this objective, several key goals have been\noutlined and will be rigorously evaluated to ensure the overall\neffectiveness of the model.\n1) Conduct an extensive review of existing methodologies\nfor collecting traffic flow data at specific locations and\ntimes. This phase involves the analysis of various inter-\nnational traffic datasets, with the goal of constructing a\nbespoke local dataset suitable for input into predictive\ntraffic models.\n2) Develop and train machine learning models for traffic\nprediction based on existing research [13], [43] and\nemploy established datasets such as METR-LA, Q-\nTraffic, and MalTra (described in Section III-F).\n3) Evaluate and compare the model predictions using stan-\ndard metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE),\nthe mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the\nroot mean squared error (RMSE) (discussed in Section\nV-B, following the practices established in the literature.\nThis approach seeks to bridge the gap between local traffic\ndynamics and predictive modeling, providing a scalable, data-\ndriven solution to improve traffic forecasting and management\non the Maltese islands.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: we begin with\na comprehensive examination of the traffic data architecture,\nemphasising the intricacies of spatial-temporal data and its\nsignificance in transportation systems. Next, we provide an\nanalysis of the current transportation framework in Malta,\ncontextualising the study within local traffic dynamics. The\ndiscussion then shifts to the theoretical foundation of graph\ntheory, which is essential for understanding the application of\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) in traffic flow prediction. A\ndetailed review of related systems and case studies follows,\nproviding critical insights and facilitating a comparative anal-\nsis of various datasets used in traffic modelling.

Non-Euclidean data refers to data\nthat lacks an inherent structure. A graph formulation of such\nan instance can be represented as a graph G, where,\n$G = (V, E, W)$\nwhere $V$ is the node-set (i.e.roads), $E$ the edge set, and $W$ is a\nweighted matrix (such as adjacency/feature matrix) [14]. An\nAdjacency matrix is a way of representing the edges between\nthe nodes in a matrix structure of 1's and O's (booleans),\nsuch that 1 denotes a connection (a direct path between the\ntwo nodes) and 0 denotes otherwise. Furthermore, a feature\nmatrix reveals additional information/characteristics linked to\nthe nodes themselves.

[17] the authors use STGCNs for traffic\nspeed predictions at the sensor locations. This model combines\nGNNs and 1D-CNNs where they operate alternatively among\nthe layers, where the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nis responsible for capturing the spatial dependency (local\nneighbourhood of nodes) while the CNN is responsible for\nthe temporal dependency (time data).\nOn a contrary note, Li et al.

The\nnovel approach includes a mixture of data mining followed but\nmachine learning techniques, where the scope of this research\nwas to investigate whether it is possible to predict vehicular\ntraffic patterns based on mobile data. Although both the current\nresearch and this paper make use of mobile data, the projects\ndiffer in the method through which their data was obtained, as\ndata in the latter paper is gathered from a telecommunications\nprovider based in Malta. This data was used to generate an\norigin-destination (OD) matrix corresponding to the two most\nvisited locations by a user. The authors propose a clustering\napproach to extract these two main locations, specifically the\nDBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications)\nclustering technique. This is done by grouping the geograph-\nical coordinates based on a 500-meter radial coverage and\nchecking which two clusters had the most activity going on.\nA spatial binning representation is then applied to the data, to\nsmooth and reduce noise from the data, allowing important\npatterns to stand out, followed by a Multilayer Perceptron\nClassifier (MLPC) predictive model based on a neural network\ntrained on grid nodes traffic levels. The findings obtained show\na significant performance in predicting traffic flow demand\nwithin a location rather than the traffic flow rate itself.\nAnother research conducted by by Pace [20], also aims to\ntarget the traffic problem in Malta. For this investigation, the\nauthors decided to gather a dataset of vehicle counts through\nthe use of live-feed footage from an online webcam provider,\nSkylinewebcams [1], for a duration of seven days, during peak\nhours from 06:00hrs to 09:00hrs for six busy locations in\nMalta.

Google\nTimeline is a component of the Google Maps package that\nenables users to view their past travel routes and export them.\nHowever, the data collected by this feature is not deterministic\nand incomplete meaning that if the same trip is taken twice,\nthe resulting set of points may not be identical and may fail to\nrecord every road travelled. To address these issues, a multi-\nstep pipeline has been developed to filter the data obtained\nfrom Google Timeline and convert it into a traffic dataset for\nfurther analysis.\nIn our data extraction process, we checked various phone\nmodels, operating systems and app versions to ensure all the\nnecessary data was uniform.

This means that if\na user travels the same route twice, it is possible that it will\noutput two different sets of points while being incomplete in\nthe sense that not all roads within a particular route may be\nidentified and recorded.\nAs a consequence of this, there are a few missing records\nin between journeys, resulting in an incomplete series of time\ninterval records. Since the majority of users adhere to a daily\nschedule or routine during the course of the day, they are likely\nto pass through the same road around a similar time, thus\nleaving certain time intervals without a corresponding value,\nas seen in Table II. To use MalTra for traffic forecasting, the\nfirst step to be done is to generate and populate any missing\nvalues with synthetic data.\nOur process consists of two steps: the first is to generate\nmissing values for missing days, and the second is to generate\nmissing values for certain time intervals."}, {"title": "1) Missing Days Generation:", "content": "The first step of this oper-\nation is the generation of missing records for specific\ndays throughout specific time periods.

A time series is said to be\nstationary if there are no trending or seasonal impacts on it.\nAs suggested by [18], instead of feeding all the timestamps\nto the ARIMA Model, they focused on a period of one week,\nwhile the prediction was based upon the aggregated values of\nthe former weeks. Thus the forecasted value for a particular\nday of the week, such as next Monday, is the average traffic\nspeed from the previous four Mondays. However, when really\nanalysing this approach, it was concluded that a single average\nspeed value for a corresponding day is not really helpful at\nall.\nStating that on Monday the speed will be X and on Tuesday\nit will be Y, is not that useful. On the contrary, having an\naverage speed which corresponds to a particular hour would\nbe more beneficial, for example, at 06:00 the speed is X but\nat, 07:00, the speed is 2X.\nHowever, while going down this route we quickly realized\nthat for every interval there is only one corresponding value,\ni.e. the average of that interval. This would obviously not work\nas a model can not base any prediction on one input value,\nthus this approach was not adopted.\nThe alternative approach targeting individual time intervals\nthemselves rather than the whole time series is to extract all\nthe duration values recorded for a selected interval.

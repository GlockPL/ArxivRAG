However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WILDVIS, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WILDVIS provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WILDVIS's utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WILDVIS is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "While hundreds of millions of users interact with chatbots like ChatGPT (Malik, 2023), the conversation logs remain largely opaque for open research, limiting our understanding of user behavior and system performance. Recently, initiatives such as WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024) and LMSYS-Chat-1M (Zheng et al., 2024) have released millions of real-world user-chatbot interactions, offering rich opportunities to study interaction dynamics. However, the volume and complexity of these datasets pose significant challenges for effective analysis.\nTo help researchers uncover patterns and anomalies within these vast chat datasets, we introduce WILDVIS, an interactive tool for exploring million-scale chat logs. WILDVIS enables researchers to find conversations based on specific criteria, understand topic distributions, and explore semantically similar conversations, all while maintaining efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates an example search using WILDVIS, applying criteria such as the keyword \u201cElection,\u201d conversations with more than two turns, and chats from users in Florida, among others.\nWILDVIS features two main components: an exact, compositional filter-based retrieval system, which allows users to refine their search using ten predefined filters such as keywords, geographical location, IP address, and more. The second component is an embedding-based visualization module,"}, {"title": "User Interface", "content": "WILDVIS consists of two primary pages-a filter-based search page and an embedding visualization page-along with a conversation details page. These pages are designed to provide users with both high-level overviews and detailed insights into individual conversations."}, {"title": "Filter-Based Search Page", "content": "The filter-based search page (Figure 2) enables users to filter the dataset based on a list of criteria. Users can input keywords to retrieve relevant conversations or narrow down results using specific"}, {"title": "Embedding Visualization Page", "content": "In addition to traditional search capabilities, WILD-VIS offers an embedding visualization page (Figure 3), which allows users to explore conversations based on their semantic similarity. Conversations are represented as dots on a 2D plane, with similar conversations placed closer together.\nBasic Visualization Each conversation appears as a dot, with different datasets distinguished by color. Hovering over a dot reveals a preview of the conversation, and clicking on it navigates to"}, {"title": "Conversation Details Page", "content": "The conversation details page (Figure 8 in Appendix D) provides a detailed view of individual conversations. This page displays all the turns between the user and the chatbot, along with associated metadata. Similar to the filter-based search page, all metadata fields are clickable, allowing users to apply filters based on their values. However, if users arrive at this page by clicking a dot on the embedding visualization page, the filtering will be applied within the embedding visualization context. A toggle switch on the conversation details page allows users to control which page (filter-based search or embedding visualization) clicking on metadata fields will direct them to."}, {"title": "System Implementation", "content": "WILDVIS is designed to efficiently process large-scale conversational datasets."}, {"title": "System Architecture", "content": "WILDVIS operates on a client-server architecture, where the server handles data processing, search, and conversation embedding, while the client provides an interface for data exploration. The high-level system architecture is illustrated in Figure 4.\nUsers interact with the frontend web interface, which communicates their queries to the backend server. The backend server is built using"}, {"title": "Scalability and Optimization", "content": "To manage the large volume of data and ensure smooth user interaction, WILDVIS uses several optimization strategies."}, {"title": "Search", "content": "For search functionalities, an index is built for each dataset with all metadata using Elasticsearch, allowing the backend to efficiently retrieve relevant conversations. To reduce the load during queries with a large number of matches, we employ two strategies: pagination, which retrieves results one page at a time with up to 30 conversations per page, and limiting the number of retrieved matches to 10,000 conversations per search."}, {"title": "Embedding Visualization - Frontend", "content": "Rendering a large number of conversation embeddings is computationally intensive for a browser, especially on mobile devices, and may lead to visual clutter with overlapping dots. To mitigate these issues, we use Deck.gl to render large numbers of points efficiently. Additionally, we restrict the visualization to a subset of 1,500 conversations per dataset, ensuring smooth rendering and clear visualization."}, {"title": "Embedding Visualization - Backend", "content": "On the backend, computing embeddings for a large number of conversations can introduce significant delays. To address this, we precompute the 2D coordinates for the subset of conversations selected for visualization. These precomputed results are then compressed using gzip and stored in a file, which is sent to the user upon their first visit to the embedding visualization page. The compressed file is approximately 1 MB in size and only needs to be downloaded once.\nAlthough we only display a subset of conversations, users may still need to search the entire dataset. To support this, we integrate the embedding visualization with the Elasticsearch engine."}, {"title": "Performance Evaluation", "content": "To evaluate the efficiency of our system, we generated ten random keyword-based search queries and measured the execution time for each using our tool. On the filter-based search page, each query took an average of 0.47 seconds (\u00b10.06s). In comparison, a naive for-loop-based approach using the HuggingFace Datasets library took 1148.89 seconds (\u00b125.28s). For embedding visualization, the same measurement method was used, and each query took an average of 0.43 seconds (\u00b10.01s)."}, {"title": "Use Cases", "content": "This section presents several use cases that demonstrate the potential of WILDVIS. It is important to note that WILDVIS is designed primarily for exploratory data analysis rather than for final quantitative analysis."}, {"title": "Data", "content": "WILDVIS currently supports two datasets: WildChat (Zhao et al., 2024) and LMSYS-Chat-1M (Zheng et al., 2024). These datasets are integrated into the system by building Elasticsearch indices and precomputing the 2D coordinates of a randomly selected subset of conversations for embedding visualization."}, {"title": "Facilitating Chatbot Misuse Research", "content": "One application of WILDVIS is in facilitating studies on chatbot misuse. We show here that WILDVIS is able to both reproduce existing studies on chatbot misuse and to discover new misuse cases."}, {"title": "Reproducing a Study on Journalist Misuse", "content": "In this use case, we replicate the findings of Brigham et al. (2024), which identified instances of journalists misusing the chatbot behind WildChat to paraphrase existing articles for their work. To locate a specific instance mentioned in the study, we use the following quote from the original research:\nwrite a new article out of the information\nin this article, do not make it obvious\nyou are taking information from them but\nin very sensitive information give them\ncredit.\nTo find this conversation, we enter the phrase you are taking information from them in the \u201cContains\""}, {"title": "Reproducing a Study on User Self-Disclosure", "content": "In another example, we replicate findings from a study on user self-disclosure behaviors by Mireshghallah et al. (2024). We search for a key phrase from that paper: I have invited my father. Again, the search returns a single result, allowing us to find the conversation discussed in the study."}, {"title": "Discovering Additional Misuse Cases", "content": "WILD-VIS also facilitates the discovery of additional misuse cases. For instance, by searching for conversations that contain both personally identifiable information (PII) and the term \u201cVisa Officer\u201d, we identified multiple entries from the same IP address. Further filtering based on this IP address revealed that the user appears to be affiliated with an immigration service firm and has disclosed sensitive client information."}, {"title": "Visualizing and Comparing Topics", "content": "A powerful feature of the embedding visualization page in WILDVIS is its ability to visualize the overall distribution of topics, with conversations of similar topics positioned close to each other. In our previous discussion on embedding conversations, we illustrated language-specific clusters (Figure 9 in Appendix B). As another example, for English data, this visualization reveals that the embedding space can be roughly divided into four regions: coding (by searching for \"python\u201d), writing assistance (by searching for \"email", "story": "and math question answering (by searching for \u201chow many\u201d), as illustrated in Figure 5. This observation aligns with the findings in Merrill and Lerman (2024).\nThis feature also allows for the comparison of topic distributions across different datasets. By inspecting regions with different colors, users can identify outliers, regions where one dataset is well-represented while the other is not, and areas where both datasets overlap. By hovering over these regions, patterns in the types of conversations can be observed. For example, we found that WildChat contains more conversations related to creating writing and an outlier cluster of Midjourney prompt generation (see Figure 10) compared to LMSYS-Chat-1M, while LMSYS-Chat-1M has outlier clusters of conversations about chemistry (see Figure 11)."}, {"title": "Characterizing User-Specific Patterns", "content": "WILDVIS can also be used to visualize the topics of all conversations associated with a specific user on the embedding map. For example, Figure 12 displays all conversations of a single user, revealing two main topic clusters: coding-related and email writing-related."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "HuggingFace Dataset Viewer HuggingFace's Dataset Viewer (Lhoest et al., 2021) provides basic search functionalities for datasets hosted on HuggingFace. However, it is designed for general dataset visualization and is not specifically tailored for conversational datasets. For example, while it offers useful statistics, navigating JSON-formatted conversations in a table format can be cumbersome and lacks the intuitive visualization needed for exploring conversational data.\nPaper Visualization Tools The ACM Fellows' Citation Visualization tool embeds ACM Fellows based on their contribution statements. While its interface shares many similarities with the embedding visualization page of WILDVIS, it focuses on publication data rather than conversational data. Another relevant work is Yen et al. (2024), which visualizes papers in a similar manner, with an added conversational component that allows users to interact with the visualizations by asking questions. However, it is also primarily designed for academic papers rather than large-scale chat datasets.\nBrowser Tools for Chat Visualization Several browser-based tools exist for chat visualization, such as ShareGPT, which allows users to share their conversations. However, ShareGPT lacks support for searching large-scale chat datasets. Similarly, browser extensions like ShareLM enable users to upload and view their conversations, and ChatGPT History Search offers search functionality for a user's personal conversations. However, these tools are not designed for the exploration or analysis of large-scale chat datasets.\nLarge-scale Data Analysis Tools Specialized tools like ConvoKit (Chang et al., 2020) provide a framework for analyzing dialogue data. In comparison, WILDVIS is designed to offer an intuitive interface for interactively exploring and visualizing chat datasets. This makes WILDVIS particularly useful for preliminary data exploration and hypothesis generation. Another notable tool, WIMBD (Elazar et al., 2024), supports the analysis and comparison of large text corpora, offering functionalities"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we introduced WILDVIS, an interactive web-based tool designed for exploring large-scale conversational datasets. By combining powerful search functionalities with intuitive visualization capabilities, WILDVIS enables researchers to uncover patterns and gain insights from vast collections of user-chatbot interactions. The system's scalability optimizations ensure efficient handling of million-scale datasets, while maintaining a responsive and user-friendly experience.\nWILDVIS fills a gap in existing tools by providing a specialized platform for visualizing and exploring chat datasets, which are inherently challenging to analyze using generic dataset viewers. Our use cases demonstrate the tool's potential to replicate and extend existing research on chatbot misuse and user self-disclosure, as well as to facilitate topic-based conversation exploration."}, {"title": "Embedding Visualization on Mobile Devices", "content": "Figure 6 shows a screenshot of the embedding visualization page on mobile devices.

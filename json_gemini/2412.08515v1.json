The Magnet loss, as presented in\nEquation (4), is composed of two main components: intra-cluster variance minimization, controlled by $\u03b1$, and inter-cluster\nseparation, now influenced by $\u03b2$. To balance these competing objectives, we developed dynamic strategies to adjust $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$\nbased on the current training epoch $E$, as formulated in Equation (10). Initially, the focus is on achieving tight clustering of\nintra-class samples by assigning larger values to $\u03b1$. Subsequently, $\u03b2$ plays a greater role in encouraging separation between\nclusters. The update rule for $\u03b1$ follows an exponential decay schedule due to the simple subtraction as a margin term. It starts at\na value of $1 + \u03b1_0$, where $\u03b1_0$ controls the initial strength, and gradually decreases by the factor $e^{\\frac{E}{1.05 \\cdot E_{total}}}$ towards the commonly\nset value of 1.0 as training progresses. This approach ensures that the focus on minimizing intra-cluster variance gradually\nweakens as the model learns to form tighter clusters.\nIn contrast, the update rule for $\u03b2$ follows a linear schedule, starting from $\u03b2_0$, and decreases linearly until it reaches zero after\nthe first 20% of the conventional training period. This linear decay ensures that the inter-cluster distance is encouraged early in\ntraining, but gradually becomes more significant as training progresses. This schedule ensures that $\u03b2$ gradually diminishes and\ntherefore increases the effect of distancing the clusters. This mechanism allows the model to be unconstrained by $\u03b2$ in the early\nstages due to the multiplication factor and its initialization with 1.0, but ensures that the influence of the inter-cluster distance\ndenominator increases for the overall loss.\nBased on our experiments, the intra-cluster is mostly relevant during early epochs, whereas the exponential decrease of $\u03b1$\nhelps to diminish the effect of intra-cluster variance distance later in the training progress. However, the inter-cluster importance\nneeds to be linearly increased by decreasing $\u03b2$ in order to move the clusters continuously and gradually farther apart till the\nmodel converges.\nTo ensure numerical stability across our experiments, we added $\u03b5$ and set it to $1 \\cdot 10^{-8}$ as a diminutive constant to prevent\ndivision by zero and underflow of floating point numbers.

{"title": "Robust Semi-supervised Multimodal Medical Image Segmentation via Cross Modality Collaboration", "authors": ["Xiaogen Zhou", "Yiyou Sun", "Min Deng", "Winnie Chiu Wing Chu", "Qi Dou"], "abstract": "Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.

It leverages synergistic information of multiple modalities to outperform single-modality solutions. Many multimodal methods have been developed for medical image segmentation. These methods either concatenate a large array of well-annotated multiple Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) as input [14,15], or fuse higher-level information from pre-aligned modalities within a latent space [2,8]. However, in real-world clinical settings, the availability of extensive collections of meticulously annotated and anatomically aligned datasets from various modalities cannot be always guaranteed. This is primarily due to the expensive costs associated with detailed annotation and a shortage of experienced clinicians available for labeling tasks. Consequently, robustness to sparsely labeled data or misaligned modalities during inference is essential for a widely-applicable multimodal learning method.\nA typical solution to address the scarcity of labeled data is to employ semi-supervised learning techniques [1,16]. These methods can effectively leverage the limited labeled data in conjunction with abundant unlabeled data to train deep learning models, thereby mitigating the dependence on costly labeled data while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, most existing semi-supervised learning methods are inherently constrained to single-modality input, failing to capitalize on the wealth of multimodal data frequently encountered in daily clinical routines. Furthermore, Zhu et al. [18] and Zhang et al. [13] have attempted to address this by applying semi-supervised learning to minimize consistency loss on abundant unlabeled data across different modalities. However, different modalities vary in intensity distributions and appearances, and simply minimizing consistency loss may not be sufficient for effective feature fusion and alignment. To address this challenge, a recent work [2] introduces a modality-collaborative semi-supervised framework. By leveraging modality-specific knowledge, this method endeavors to enhance multimodal image segmentation, thereby facilitating more effective feature fusion and alignment.\nFor the effective extraction of modality-invariant representations that capture critical information and enable feature fusion across various modalities, it is beneficial to identify and leverage modality-specific knowledge. This can be accomplished through modality-independent feature extraction, which distills the characteristics and semantic representations of each modality [2,3]. Additionally, integrating a modality-collaborative strategy can significantly enhance feature fusion and alignment across different modalities, ensuring effective synergistic integration of multimodal data [2,14]. However, these works fail to enforce constraints to regularize the underlying anatomical structures during the feature fusion stage, which is crucial for maintaining alignment.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal framework that incorporates cross modality collaboration and contrastive consistent learning. This framework is robust to scenarios with limited labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework exploits a novel cross modality-collaboration strategy to regularize the underlying channel-wise features and distill modality-independent knowledge. The modality-independent knowledge extracted from each modality is fused to a common fusion layer, which contains collaborative information for segmentation.

We first employ two 3D modality-specific encoders to get the initial modality-independent features from multimodal inputs. Then, we introduce a cross-modality collaboration strategy to facilitate feature fusion and channel-wise alignment. Subsequently, we introduce a contrastive consistent learning module aimed at reducing inconsistencies in anatomical structures across prediction maps derived from the unlabeled data. The details of our method are elaborated in the following sections."}, {"title": "2.1 Cross Modality Collaboration for Alignment and Feature Fusion", "content": "We denote the multimodal images by $D^{l} = \\{\\{(x_{a,i}, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}, \\{(x_{b,i}, y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\}$ and $D^{u} = \\{\\{(x_{a,j}^{u}), \\{(x_{b,j}^{u})\\}_{j=1}^{M}\\}$, where $x_{a,i}$ and $x_{u,j}$ denote the labeled and unlabeled data in modality a and b, respectively. The $y_i$ and $y_i^{'}$ are the corresponding segmentation masks for $x_{a,i}^{l}$ and $x_{b,i}^{l}$. The N and M denote the number of labeled and unlabled samples, and $N \\ll M$. Each modality $x_a^{l}$ and $x_b^{l}$ is input to modality-specific encoder $E^a$ and $E^b$, respectively, which are fine-tuned from the pre-trained encoder of SAM-Med3D [10]. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), we integrate an adapter module within each Vision Transformer (ViT) block. This adapter serves as a bottleneck infrastructure and consists of a sequence of two 3D convolutional layers with different kernel sizes.\nThen, we obtain its distinctive semantic (DS) features by $F_{ds}^a = E^a(x_i^l)$ and $F_{ds}^b = E^b(x_i^l)$. For effective extraction of distinctive semantic features $F_{ds}^a$ and $F_{ds}^b$, which are expected to regularize underlying anatomical structures from a perspective of channel-wise feature alignment across modalities, we introduce a Channel-wise Semantic Consistency (CSC) loss which is used to align the channel-wise features. In specific, the $L_{csc}$ loss can be defined as follows:\n$L_{csc} = \\min_{E^a, E^b} - \\sum_{c=1}^{C} log \\frac{exp(Sim((F_{ds}^a)_c, (F_{ds}^b)_c))}{\\sum_{c=1}^C exp(Sim((F_{ds}^a)_c,(F_{ds}^b)_c))},$\nwhere $c \\in \\{1, 2, ..., C\\}$ denotes the cth channel of two features, i.e., $F_{ds}^a$ and $F_{ds}^b$, respectively. $Sim(...)$ represents the cosine similarity [9] used to measure the channel-wise semantic feature similarity between the latent representations.\nAfter the feature-wise alignment procedure, which mitigates the influence of modality-specific appearance features from multimodal data, we introduce a novel Modality-Independent Awareness (MIA) module to further harness modality independent knowledge from each modality for effective feature fusion. As is known from literature of deep neural networks, modality-independent knowledge is useful in learning generalized and robust representations across various imaging modalities [2,17]. As depicted in Fig. 1, the MIA module integrates modality-aware attention mechanisms [15], 3D convolutional layers, and a fusion layer. Subsequently, the features $F_{mia}^a$ and $F_{mia}^b$ generated by each MIA module are subsequently merged in a fusion layer to produce the fused feature."}, {"title": "2.2 Contrastive Consistent Learning with Contrastive Consistency", "content": "Contrastive consistency has shown effectiveness in semi-supervised learning [2,13]. The formulation of the contrastive consistency term is based on the correlation and differential information across various modalities. The consistency of their predictions acts as the impetus for semi-supervised cross-modal knowledge reciprocal learning. This also holds true for our scenario. We first build two decoders $D_a$ and $D_b$, which are fine-tuned the pre-trained foundation model decoder [6] on our datasets. During training, the weights of our model are optimized using a supervised loss function $L_{sup}$ on labeled data, which is defined as follows:\n$L_{Sup} = E_{\\min_{E^a, E^b, D_a, D_b}} [L_{CE}(D^a(E^a(x_{a,i}^l)), y) + L_{Dice}(D^b (E^b((x_{b,i}^l)), y))],$\nwhere $L_{CE}$ and $L_{Dice}$ represent cross-entropy loss function and Dice coefficient loss function.

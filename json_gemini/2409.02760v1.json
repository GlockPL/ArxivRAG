Introduction", "content": "Multi-criteria sorting (MCS) arises as a rapidly developing branch within the realm of multi-criteria decision making. Its primary objective is to assign a given set of alternatives to several predefined ordered categories, taking into account multiple criteria (Zopounidis & Doumpos, 2002; Belahc\u00e9ne et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). It finds extensive applications in various real-life scenarios, including but not limited to credit rating (Doumpos & Figueira, 2019), inventory management (Liu et al., 2016), supplier evaluation (Pelissari & Duarte, 2022), green building rating (Zhang & Li, 2023) and policy assessments (Dias et al., 2018). In the literature, numerous MCS approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly categorized into the following four distinct groups: utility function-based MCS approaches (Greco et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2020a; Wu & Liao, 2023; Ru et al., 2023), outranking-based MCS approaches (Doumpos et al., 2009; Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2019; Almeida-Dias et al., 2010; Kadzi\u0144ski et al., 2015), distance-based MCS approaches (de Lima Silva & de Almeida Filho, 2020; de Lima Silva et al., 2020) and decision rule-based MCS approaches (Kadzi\u0144ski et al., 2016).\nAmong various approaches, the threshold-based MCS model, falling under the group of utility function-based MCS approaches, has garnered considerable attention due to its high interpretability and intuitive understandability for decision makers (Liu et al., 2019; Li & Zhang, 2024). This model quantifies each alternative utilizing an additive utility function, introduces category thresholds to delimit each category, and then determines the assignment of each alternative by comparing its comprehensive utility value with category thresholds (Kadzi\u0144ski et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). Prior to adopting this model, it is essential to determine the shape of marginal utility functions and category thresholds. To reduce the cognitive effort required by decision makers (Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2011; Kadzi\u0144ski et al., 2021; H\u00fcllermeier & S\u0142owi\u0144ski, 2024a,b), the indirect elicitation-based MCS approach, which infers the shape of marginal utility functions and category thresholds based on preference information such as assignment examples, stand out (Liu et al., 2020b; Jacquet-Lagr\u00e9ze & Siskos, 2001; Kadzi\u0144ski et al., 2017; Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2019).\nThere are usually two types of indirect elicitation approaches: batch elicitation and incremental elicitation (Khannoussi et al., 2022, 2024). In batch elicitation, preference information is provided as a \u201cbatch\u201d by the decision maker, and numerous batch elicitation-based MCS models have been developed in the literature. For instance, the classic MCS method, the UTilit\u00e9s Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS), transforms the batch assignment example preference information into some constraints by using mathematical programming techniques (Devaud et al., 1980). Followed by this, various variants of UTADIS have been proposed, incorporating distinct objective functions or considering diverse extensions (Esmaelian et al., 2016; W\u00f3jcik et al., 2023). To consider all compatible information with the assignment example preference information provided by the decision maker, the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and Stochastic Ordinal Regression (SOR) methods were proposed (Kadzi\u0144ski & Tervonen, 2013; Doumpos et al., 2014). In incremental elicitation, preference information is supplied sequentially, allowing the preference model to improve iteratively. Incremental elicitation-based MCS models typically start with an initial set of reference alternatives, where the decision maker is asked to provide category assignment for these reference alternatives. This information is then incrementally integrated into the preference model. This process continues until a predetermined ter-mination criterion is met. Compared to batch elicitation-based MCS models, incremental elicitation-based MCS models reduce the number of holistic judgments required from the decision maker, thereby lowering their cognitive effort and enhancing the efficiency of the decision making process. For instance, Benabbou et al. (2017) proposed an incremental elicitation method of Choquet capacities for multi-criteria decision making by using minimax regret strategy. Nefla et al. (2019) presented an interactive elicitation approach for the majority rule sorting model. \u00d6zpeynirci et al. (2018) developed an interactive algorithm for MCS problems with category size restrictions. Kadzi\u0144ski & Ciomek (2021) designed some active learning strate-gies to interactively elicit assignment examples for the threshold-based MCS model based on the outcomes of ROR and SOR. Gehrlein et al. (2023) designed an active learning approach by interactively eliciting pairwise preferences and applied it for validator selection problems in blockchain environments.\nAlthough these incremental elicitation-based MCS models are effective, they may face challenges. In some MCS scenarios, decision makers may provide answers that are inconsistent with previously given pref-erence information during the incremental preference elicitation process (Teso et al., 2016), and may exhibit non-monotonic preferences (Ghaderi et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2019). The oversight of inconsistencies and potential non-monotonic preferences may lead to conflicts and limit the applicability of these methods. Therefore, it is crucial to take into account both inconsistencies and potentially non-monotonic preferences in incremental elicitation-based MCS models. Despite Guo et al. (2019) introduced a progressive approach for MCS problems with non-monotonic preferences and inconsistent preference information, this method overlooks the potential discrepancy in information amount across different alternatives, which may escalate the cognitive load on the decision maker by necessitating increased number of assignment example prefer-ence information. As a result, it is imperative to introduce a novel incremental preference elicitation-based approach to learning potentially non-monotonic preferences in MCS problems, taking into account inconsis-tent assignment example preference information. Consequently, the primary contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\nFirst, we develop a max-margin optimization-based model to effectively handle potentially non-monotonic preferences and inconsistent assignment example preference information encountered in each iteration of the incremental preference elicitation process. Specifically, this model introduces some auxiliary variables to tolerate such inconsistencies, aiming to simultaneously maximize discriminative power while minimizing inconsistencies.\nSecond, leveraging the optimal objective function values of the developed max-margin optimization-based model, we design some information amount measurement methods and question selection strategies to identify the most informative alternative in each iteration of the incremental preference elicitation process. In particular, all proposed question selection strategies adhere to the uncertainty sampling framework in active learning (Aggarwal et al., 2014).\nThird, taking into account different termination criteria, two incremental preference elicitation-based algorithms are introduced to learn potentially non-monotonic preferences for MCS problems. Subsequently, we conduct extensive computational experiments, comparing the proposed question selection strategies with several benchmark strategies. These experiments are performed on both artificial and real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\nThe rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents the underlying sorting method utilized in this paper. Section 3 describes the research problem and then provides a resolution framework. Section 4 provides a comprehensive exposition of the proposed approach. Section 5 performs an illustrative example and some detailed computation experiments to elaborate and justify the proposed approach. Section 7 offers a comprehensive summary of this paper and identifies future directions."}, {"title": "2. The threshold-based MCS model", "content": "Let us consider a finite set of alternatives $\\mathcal{A} = \\{a_1, a_2,..., a_n\\}$ which are evaluated in light of a family of criteria $\\mathcal{G} = \\{g_1, g_2,......, g_m\\}$, where $a_i$ is the i-th alternative, $i \\in \\mathcal{N} = \\{1,2,...,n\\}$, $g_j$ denotes the j-th criterion, $j \\in \\mathcal{M} = \\{1,2,...,m\\}$. The performance level of the alternative $a_i$ over the criterion $g_j$ is denoted by $x_{ij}$, and the performance levels of all alternatives in $\\mathcal{A}$ over all criteria in $\\mathcal{G}$ form a decision matrix $\\mathcal{X} = (x_{ij})_{n \\times m}$. The aim of the MCS problem is to assign each alternative in $\\mathcal{A}$ to a predefined category in $\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_1,...,C_q\\}$, where $C_h$ is the h-th category, $h \\in \\mathcal{Q} = \\{1,...,q\\}$ and $C_h > C_{h-1}, h=2,...,q$. To accomplish the assignment of each alternative, the threshold-based MCS model adopts an additive utility function to aggregate the marginal utility of each alternative $a_i$ over all criteria $g_j, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$ into a comprehensive utility (Greco et al., 2010), i.e.,\n$U(a_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} u_j(x_{ij}), i \\in \\mathcal{N},$ (1)\nwhere $0 \\leq U(a_i) \\leq 1$ is the comprehensive utility of the alternative $a_i$, $u_j(x_{ij})$ is the marginal utility of $x_{ij}$, and $u_j(\\cdot)$ is the marginal utility function over the criterion $g_j$, $i \\in \\mathcal{N}, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$.\nIn the basic setting of the threshold-based MCS model, all criteria are assumed to be maximized, i.e., the greater $x_{ij}$, the better the alternative $a_i$ on the criterion $g_j, i \\in \\mathcal{N}, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$. As a result, the marginal utility function $u_j(\\cdot)$ which is assumed to be non-decreasing and piecewise linear is employed to depict the decision maker's preference over the criterion $g_j, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$ (Liu et al., 2020a).\nIn particular, the marginal utility function is defined with $s_j+1$ characteristic points, $j \\in \\mathcal{M}$. Let $\\beta_j^-$ and $\\beta_j^+$ be the minimum and maximum performance levels observed for all alternatives in $\\mathcal{A}$ over the criterion $g_j$ such that $\\beta_j^- = \\min_{i \\in N} x_{ij}$ and $\\beta_j^+ = \\max_{i \\in N} x_{ij}, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$, then the interval $[\\u03b2_j^-, \\beta_j^+]$ constitutes the performance range of the alternatives in $\\mathcal{A}$ over the criterion $g_j, j \\in \\mathcal{M}$. The characteristic points $\\beta_j^l, l = 1, ..., s_j+1$ divides the interval $[\\u03b2_j^-, \\beta_j^+]$ into $s_j$ subintervals of equal length, i.e., $[\\u03b2_j^1, \\beta_j^2],...,[\\u03b2_j^l, \\beta_j^{l+1}], ..., [\\u03b2_j^{s_j}, \\beta_j^{s_j+1}]$, where $\\beta_j^1 = \\beta_j^-, \\beta_j^{s_j+1} = \\beta_j^+$, and $\\beta_j^l = \\beta_j^- + \\frac{(l-1)(\\beta_j^+ - \\beta_j^-)}{s_j}, l = 2, ..., s_j$.\nLet $u_j(\\beta_j^l)$ be the marginal utility of the characteristic point $\\beta_j^l$ on the criterion $g_j$, where $u_j(\\beta_j^1) = 0$ and $u_j(\\beta_j^{s_j+1}) = 1$. Through linear interpolation, the marginal utility of $x_{ij}$ can be computed as\n$u_j(x_{ij}) = u_j(\\beta_j^l) + \\frac{x_{ij} - \\beta_j^l}{\\beta_j^{l+1} - \\beta_j^l}(u_j(\\beta_j^{l+1}) - u_j(\\beta_j^{l})), if x_{ij} \\in [\\beta_j^l, \\beta_j^{l+1}].$ (2)\nFurthermore, in the threshold-based MCS model, each category is limited by some thresholds. To do so, a category vector $\\mathbf{b} = (b_0, b_1,..., b_q)^T$ is required, where $b_{h-1}$ and $b_h$ are the lower and upper limits of the category $C_h, h \\in \\mathcal{Q}$, respectively, and $b_0 = 0, b_q = 1 + \\varepsilon, b_h < b_{h+1}, h = 2, . . ., q - 1$. On this basis, the alternative $a_i$ is assigned to the category $C_h$ if $b_{h-1} \\leq U(a_i) < b_h$."}, {"title": "3. Problem description and resolution framework", "content": "We consider the MCS problem, which aims to assign a set of alternatives $\\mathcal{A}$ to several predefined ordered categories $\\mathcal{C}$ based on the set of criteria $\\mathcal{G}$. In particular, it is assumed that the decision maker progressively provides assignment example preference information, and he/she may exhibit potentially non-monotonic preferences over some criteria. For the sake of clarity, we denote the assignment example preference in-formation in the t-th iteration as $S^t = \\{a_i \\rightarrow C_{B_i} | a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}\\}$, where $\\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\subset \\mathcal{A}$ is the set of reference alternatives.\nThe objective of this study is to develop an incremental preference elicitation-based approach to learn po-tentially non-monotonic preferences of the decision maker in MCS problems, capable of handling inconsistent assignment example preference information. To accomplish this, we present a simple resolution framework depicted in Fig. 1, and then provide a detailed explanation of the resolution framework as follows.\n(1) Model the inconsistent assignment example preference information\nWe employ a max-margin optimization-based model to effectively handle the challenge of potentially non-monotonic preferences and inconsistent assignment example preference information in each iteration of the incremental preference elicitation process. This model guarantees a comprehensive representation of the decision maker's preferences by concurrently maximizing discriminative power and minimizing inconsisten-cies.\n(2) Determine whether the termination criterion is met\nFollowing the application of our developed max-margin optimization-based model, we need to ascertain if the termination criterion is satisfied. Upon confirming the fulfillment of this criterion, the incremental preference elicitation process terminates, prompting the transition to yield the marginal utility functions and category thresholds, and then obtain the sorting result for non-reference alternatives. In case that the termination criterion is not met, progression to the next stage becomes necessary.\n(3) Identify the most informative alternative\nIn this stage, we devise some question selection strategies aimed at identifying the most informative alternative within the framework of uncertainty sampling in active learning. Once the most informative alternative is pinpointed, the decision maker is prompted to provide an category assignment for it, thereby updating the set of assignment example preference information.\n(4) Obtain the sorting result for non-reference alternatives\nUpon meeting the termination criterion, the sorting result for non-reference alternatives can be deter-mined by employing the max-margin optimization-based model and the complexity controlling optimization model.

In terms of Eq. (4), for the marginal utility $u_j(x_{ij})$, if $x_{ij}=g_j^-$, we have that $f_u(x_{ij}) = 0$, and if $x_{ij} = g_j^+$, we have that $\\sum_{j=1}^{m}f_u(g_j^+) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\frac{u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-))} = 1$. Consequently, $f_u(x_{ij})$ can ensure that the normalization of the marginal utility. For category thresholds, when $b_0 = \\sum_{j=1}^{m}u_j(g_j^-)$, we obtain that $f_b(b_0) = 0$, and when $b_q = \\sum_{j=1}^{m}u_j(g_j^-) + \\varepsilon$, we obtain that $f_b(b_q) = 1 + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-))}$. Let $\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-))}$, we can derive that $f_b(b_q) = 1 + \\varepsilon_s$. As a result, $f_b(b_h)$ can achieve the normalization of category thresholds.\nAs the discriminative power of the sorting model can be measured by the value of the parameter $\\varepsilon$ in the constraint set $\\mathcal{E}^{NM}$, the first objective of the max-margin optimization-based model is formulated as\n$\\max \\varepsilon.$ (5)\nFurthermore, to tolerate the inconsistent assignment example preference information provided by the decision maker, we introduce some auxiliary variables $\\delta_i^+$ and $\\delta_i^-$, $\\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$ that are usually utilized in the UTA approach (Ghaderi & Kadzi\u0144ski, 2021). Following this, we use $ICI^t$ to quantify the extent of inconsistency in the assignment example preference information provided by the decision maker in the t-th iteration, i.e.,\n$ICI^t = \\sum_{a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}}\\delta_i^+ + \\delta_i^-,$ (6)\nwhere $\\delta_i^+, \\delta_i^- \\geq 0$.\nOn this basis, the second objective of the max-margin optimization-based model is formulated as\n$\\min \\sum_{a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}}\\delta_i^+ + \\delta_i^-.$ (7)\nTaking into account both objectives, the final objective function of the max-margin optimization-based model can be formulated as\n$\\max \\alpha\\varepsilon - (1 - \\alpha)\\frac{\\sum_{a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}}\\delta_i^+ + \\delta_i^-}{|\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}|},$ (8)\nwhere $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ is utilized to make a trade-off between the two objectives, and $|\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}|$ denotes the number of reference alternatives in $\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$.\nRemark 2. In practice, there are two alternative options for determining the value of $\\alpha$. On the one hand, it can be directly assigned by the decision analyst during the incremental preference elicitation process, based on his/her knowledge and experience. On the other hand, it can be determined based on the model's performance, for instance, by selecting the $\\alpha$ value that yields the best performance on test sets.\nBuilding upon the aforementioned analysis, the max-margin optimization-based model can be formulated as\n$\\begin{aligned}\n&\\max \\alpha\\varepsilon - (1 - \\alpha)\\frac{\\sum_{a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}}\\delta_i^+ + \\delta_i^-}{|\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}|}\\\\\n&\\text { s.t. } b_{B_i-1} - \\delta_i^- < U(a_i) \\leq b_{B_i} - \\varepsilon + \\delta_i^+, \\text{ if } B_i \\in \\{2, ..., q - 1\\}, \\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\\\\n&U(a_i) \\leq b_1 - \\varepsilon + \\delta_i^+, \\text{ if } B_i = 1,\\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\\\\n&U(a_i) \\geq b_{q-1} - \\delta_i^-, \\text{ if } B_i = q,\\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\\\\n&U(a_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m}u_j(x_{ij}), \\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\\\\n&\\nu_j(x_{ij}) = u_j(\\beta_j^l) + \\frac{x_{ij} - \\beta_j^l}{\\beta_j^{l+1} - \\beta_j^l}(u_j(\\beta_j^{l+1}) - u_j(\\beta_j^{l})), \\text{ if } x_{ij} \\in [\\beta_j^l, \\beta_j^{l+1}], \\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}, j \\in \\mathcal{M} \\\\\n&b_h-b_{h-1} \\geq \\varepsilon, h = 2, ..., q-1 \\\\\n&\\nu_j(\\beta_j^l) \\geq 0,l = 1, ..., s_j + 1, j \\in \\mathcal{M} \\\\\n&\\nu_j(\\beta_j^l) \\leq 1,l = 1, ..., s_j + 1, j \\in \\mathcal{M} \\\\\n&\\delta_i^+, \\delta_i^- \\geq 0, \\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t} \\\\\n&0<\\varepsilon \\leq \\frac{m}{q-1}\n\\end{aligned}$ (M-1)\nRemark 3. In particular, the last constraint in the model (M-1) is set to prevent the model from being unbounded. The reason why we set the range of $\\varepsilon$ to $(0, \\frac{m}{q-1}]$ is illustrated as follows. Let $b_h, h \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ be category thresholds in a UTA-like standard form, they should satisfy some conditions, i.e., $b_0 = 0, b_q = 1 + \\varepsilon_s$, and $b_h - b_{h-1} \\geq \\varepsilon_s, h \\in \\mathcal{Q}$, where $\\varepsilon_s$ is an arbitrarily small positive number. By summing both sides of these q inequalities, we can obtain that $\\sum_{h=1}^{q}(b_h - b_{h-1}) = b_q - b_0 = 1 + \\varepsilon_s > q \\cdot \\varepsilon_s$, thus we have that $\\varepsilon_s < \\frac{1}{q}$. When considering non-monotonic preferences in the MCS problem, we have that $\\varepsilon_s = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-))}$. Since $g_j^+ \\leq 1$, we have that $\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-)) \\leq 1 \\leftrightarrow \\varepsilon \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^{m}(u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-))$. Furthermore, as $0 \\leq u_j(\\beta_j^l) \\leq 1$, the maximum value of $u_j(g_j^+) - u_j(g_j^-)$ is 1. As a result, we can conclude that $\\varepsilon < m$. In addition, $\\varepsilon_s > 0$ ensures that $\\varepsilon > 0$. To sum up, we set the range of $\\varepsilon$ to $(0, \\frac{m}{q-1}]$.\nIf the optimal solutions to the model (M-1), i.e., $\\delta_i^+, \\delta_i^*, \\forall a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$, are all equal to 0, the assignment example preference information provided by the decision maker is consistent. Otherwise, it is inconsistent. The model maximizes the discriminative power while tolerating inconsistent assignment example preference information through the introduction of some auxiliary variables, effectively modeling the decision maker's inconsistent assignment example preference information in each iteration of the incremental preference elic-itation process.\n4.2. Termination criteria\nThe incremental preference elicitation process will come to an end once a termination criterion is satisfied. In this regard, we introduce two different termination criteria that can be utilized throughout the incremental preference elicitation process.\nTermination criterion I\nTermination criterion I assumes that the decision maker has a predetermined limit on the number of questions that he/she can answer during the incremental preference elicitation process. For convenience, let the maximum number of questions that can be answered by the decision maker be denoted as T, and the number of questions already answered by the decision maker be t. If t = T, the incremental preference elicitation process will be terminated. Otherwise, the incremental preference elicitation process is continued until the number of questions already answered by the decision maker is equal to T.\nTermination criterion II\nTermination criterion II makes an assumption that the incremental preference elicitation process should be terminated only after certain performance requirements are fulfilled. In this scenario, we employ the accuracy metric to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.\nDefinition 1. Let $\\hat{f_i} \\in \\mathcal{C}$ and $f_i \\in \\mathcal{C}$ be the real and inferred category assignment of the i-th non-reference alternative in the t-th iteration, $a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}\\backslash\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$, then the accuracy metric, denoted as $Acc^t$, is computed by\n$Acc^t = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n^{rt}}\\gamma_i}{n^{rt}},$ (9)\nwhere $n^{rt}$ is the number of non-reference alternatives in the set $\\mathcal{A}\\backslash\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$. In addition, $\\gamma_i$ is a binary variable, if $\\hat{f_i} = f_i$, then $\\gamma_i = 1$; otherwise, $\\gamma_i = 0$.\nOn this basis, let $Acc_{target}$ represent the target accuracy that the decision analyst aims to achieve throughout the incremental preference elicitation process. If $Acc^t > Acc_{target}$, the incremental preference elicitation process can be terminated. Otherwise, the incremental preference elicitation process needs to continue.\n4.3. Question selection strategies\nIn each iteration of the incremental preference elicitation process of the MCS problem, the decision analyst will pose a question to the decision maker. This question can be formulated as \"which category can the alternative $a_i$ be assigned to?\" For the decision analyst, he/she should decide which alternative to ask about. To accomplish this objective, we initially design some metrics to measure the information amount associated with each alternative. Building upon this foundation, we provide some question selection strategies to identify the most informative alternative.\n4.3.1. Information amount measurement methods\nIn this section, we present the metrics utilized to measure the information amount associated with each alternative in the following.\nFor each alternative $a_i \\in \\mathcal{A}\\backslash\\mathcal{A}^{R,t}$, we add $a_i \\rightarrow C_h, h \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ to $S^t$ separately, and solve the model (M-1) q times. Let $min_h$ be the optimal objective function value when the assignment example preference information is $S^t \\cup \\{a_i \\rightarrow C_h\\}$, and $v_i = (min_1, ..., min_q)^T$ be a vector composed of $min_h"}

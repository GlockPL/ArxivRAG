Their widespread application spans diverse fields such as engineering reliability (Kabir and Papadopoulos, 2019), environmental sciences (Kaikkonen et al., 2021), healthcare (Kyrimi et al., 2021), and supply chain management (Hosseini and Ivanov, 2020), among others. They are implemented in various software tools, including R packages (e.g. bnlearn Scutari, 2010; grain H\u00f8jsgaard, 2012), Python libraries (e.g. pgmpy Ankan and Panda, 2015; pyAgrum Ducamp et al., 2020), and standalone software (e.g. AgenaRisk, BayesiaLab, BayesServer, Hugin Expert, GeNie Modeler, and Netica)\u00b9, making them accessible to a wide range of users and applications. Despite their widespread application, BNs remain an active research area with ongoing advancements in learning algorithms (e.g. Kuipers et al., 2022; Liu and Constantinou, 2022), inference techniques (e.g. Lin et al., 2020), and new types of networks (e.g. Atienza et al., 2022).\nKey reasons for the success of BNs include their explainability, flexibility, and status as the gold standard for causal modeling. Unlike black-box models, BNs offer an intuitive, transparent structure, aligning with trends in eXplainable AI (XAI) (Rudin, 2019). They provide insights into cause-and-effect relationships rather than just correlations (Peters et al., 2017). BNs are also accessible to a broad audience, not requiring deep expertise in computer science or mathematics (Kelly et al., 2013; Moe et al., 2021). Their modular design integrates data, expert knowledge, and model outputs (Leonelli et al.,"}, {"title": "2 Bayesian networks", "content": "While a full account of Bayesian networks can be found in several monographs (e.g. Koller and Friedman, 2009), a brief overview is provided here to highlight the key concepts.\nA BN gives a graphical representation of the relationship between a vector of variables of interest Y = (Y1,...,Yp) using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G and a factorization of the overall probability distribution P(Y) in terms of simpler conditional distributions P(\u03a5; \u03a5\u03c0\u2081), where Yn, denotes the parents of Y in G. More formally, the overall factorization of the probability distribution induced by the BN can be written as:\n$P_G(Y) = \\prod_{i=1}^p P(Y_i | Y_{\\pi_i}).$\nThis factorization has several advantages: it reduces the number of parameters to estimate, allows for easier expert elicitation of local relationships, and makes better use of available data by focusing only on the relevant variables and their parents.\nThe academic literature has mostly focused on three types of distributional assumptions depending on the nature of the variables: discrete, Gaussian, and conditional linear Gaussian (see e.g. Bodewes and Scutari, 2021). Discrete BNs (Heckerman et al., 1995) are such that Y is a Multinomial random variable and the local distributions are defined as\n$Y_i | Y_{\\pi_i} \\sim Multi(\\theta_{ijk}), \\text{where } \\theta_{ijk} = P(Y_i = j | Y_{\\pi_i} = k).$"}, {"title": "3 The bnRep package", "content": "R was chosen as the platform for bnRep due to its robust ecosystem for statistical modeling and seamless integration with existing tools for BNs. The bnlearn package (Scutari, 2010), one of the most widely used packages for learning and inference in BNs, provides the core class objects for bnRep, directly supporting the three main types of BNs previously discussed.

This ensures that models from bnRep can be utilized across different platforms and software environments, making the repository versatile for diverse applications and users' preferences.\nThe choice of R ensures that bnRep benefits from the CRAN ecosystem, which enforces clear documentation standards and regular package updates. This guarantees that bnRep is user-friendly, thoroughly documented, and accessible to a wide range of users. Moreover, bnRep is compatible with other R packages such as grain (H\u00f8jsgaard, 2012) and BayesNetBP (Yu et al., 2020) for inference, bnmonitor (Leonelli et al., 2023) for model diagnostics, and qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2012) for visualization, allowing for extended functionality within the R environment."}, {"title": "3.1 Why R?", "content": "R was chosen as the platform for bnRep due to its robust ecosystem for statistical modeling and seamless integration with existing tools for BNs.

Most networks come from papers published from 2020 onwards, and all are stored as bn.fit objects from the bnlearn package, which supports three types of BNs: discrete, Gaussian, and conditional linear Gaussian. These are the most widely used types of BNs in research and applications, making bnlearn's support for these models crucial for bnRep's extensive and versatile repository.\nThe package also includes the bnRep_summary dataframe, which provides detailed information about each network. This includes the type of network, summaries of the DAG structure (form, number of nodes, edges, etc.), how the probabilities and DAG were defined (from data, expert knowledge, etc.), and the area of application (e.g., environmental science, engineering, medicine). Summaries of the repository and the networks' characteristics, along with visualizations, are available on the bnRep GitHub page (https://github.com/manueleleonelli/bnRep).\nTo facilitate interactive exploration, bnRep includes a Shiny app, accessible via the bnRep_app() function. The app allows users to filter and explore the networks' database. It is freely available online at https://manueleleonelli.shinyapps.io/bnRep/, providing a user-friendly interface to access the repository without needing to install the R package."}, {"title": "4 Conclusions and future directions", "content": "The bnRep package provides a comprehensive, well-documented repository of BNs, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. By facilitating benchmarking, replicability, and education, bnRep supports the advancement of BN research and cross-field collaboration. Its integration with bnlearn ensures compatibility with widely-used tools, while the Shiny app enhances accessibility for users.\nFuture updates will expand the repository to include new types of networks, such as copula (Hanea et al., 2015), additive (Kratzer et al., 2023), hybrid (e.g. P\u00e9rez-Bernab\u00e9 et al., 2016), dynamic (e.g. Shiguihara et al., 2021), and continuous time BNs (Nodelman et al., 2002). The project's open-source nature encourages contributions through GitHub, fostering community-driven growth. Additionally, benchmarking functions will be introduced, promoting the development of consistent evaluation methods in the BN field. In conclusion, bnRep not only addresses the current lack of documented BNs but also lays the foundation for establishing benchmarks and fostering innovation in BN research."}]}

{"title": "TwIPS: A Large Language Model Powered Texting Application to Simplify Conversational Nuances for Autistic Users", "authors": ["Rukhshan Haroon", "Fahad Dogar"], "abstract": "Autistic individuals often experience difficulties in conveying and interpreting emotional tone and non-literal nuances. Many also mask\u00b9 their communication style to avoid being misconstrued by others, spending considerable time and mental effort in the pro- cess. To address these challenges in text-based communication, we present TwIPS2, a prototype texting application powered by a large language model (LLM), which can assist users with: a) deciphering tone and meaning of incoming messages, b) ensuring the emotional tone of their message is in line with their intent, and c) coming up with alternate phrasing for messages that could be misconstrued and received negatively by others. We leverage an AI-based sim- ulation and a conversational script to evaluate TwIPS with 8 autistic participants in an in-lab setting. Our findings show TwIPS enables a convenient way for participants to seek clarifications, provides a better alternative to tone indicators, and facilitates constructive reflection on writing technique and style. We also examine how autistic users utilize language for self-expression and interpreta- tion in instant messaging, and gather feedback for enhancing our prototype. We conclude with a discussion around balancing user- autonomy with Al-mediation, establishing appropriate trust levels in Al systems, and autistic users' customization needs in the context of AI-assisted communication.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental disorder characterized by challenges in verbal and nonverbal com- munication, difficulties in social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and/or sensory sensitivities [1, 2]. It is one of the most common neuro-developmental disorders in the United States, currently ob- served at a prevalence rate of approximately 1 in 36 among 8-year- old children [3]. Many autistic individuals find it challenging to process non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions and body lan- guage, in face-to-face (FTF) interactions. Variations in vocal pitch and tone can add more layers of complexity to communication, making FTF interactions overwhelming for them. Prior work in disabilities and linguistics underscores a preference for written communication among autistic individuals, highlighting a tendency towards email and text messaging over FTF interactions [4]. This preference is attributed to the greater control and sensory ease provided by written communication [5]. However, studies indicate autistic individuals often experience difficulties in conveying and interpreting emotional tone and non-literal nuances in text-based communication, and standard chat features like GIFs and emojis contribute to these challenges instead of addressing them [6, 7]. Many also mask their writing style to avoid being misconstrued by others, spending considerable time and mental effort in the process.\nIn the past, technology has been extensively utilized to enhance autism diagnosis methods [8, 9], therapeutic interventions [10, 11], social support tools [12, 13], and the overall quality of life [14, 15] of autistic individuals. Accessibility researchers have also advo- cated for the redesign of existing, mainstream applications to better meet the usability needs of autistic users [16-18]. More recently, advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT [19] have opened up new possibilities for AI-assisted assistive communi- cation. Their applications range from helping dyslexic individuals write emails [20] to providing social communication support for autistic individuals in professional settings [21]. Thus, LLMs have demonstrated their capability to interpret and generate text with a level of nuance that rivals human abilities in various practical scenarios [22]. Despite these advances, text-based communication challenges for autistic users persist, making it crucial and timely to investigate how state of the art in LLMs can be used to address them.\nInformed by specific communication challenges and design needs of autistic users identified in prior work [6, 7], we introduce TwIPS, a novel texting application that leverages recent advances in LLMs [22] to grasp nuanced and implicit elements like emotional tone and intent from text messages. Based on its understanding of these elements, it can dynamically generate feedback for users that is tailored to the specificities of each conversation. TwIPS comprises of three features (described in detail in \u00a73) not found in traditional texting applications, all of which are powered by GPT-4 [22]:"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we review the communication preferences of autistic individuals, ongoing efforts to integrate AI assistance into human writing, and broader initiatives leveraging computing technologies in the context of ASD."}, {"title": "2.1 Communication Preferences in ASD", "content": "Numerous studies in disabilities and linguistics research have ex- plored the communication preferences of autistic individuals. Howard et al. conducted a study involving 245 autistic adult participants, and on average, these individuals selected email and text-messaging as their preferred modes of communication over FTF conversations [4]. Nicolaidis et al. showed that there existed a link between the per- ceived success of healthcare interactions among autistic adults and the availability of written communication options [5]. Researchers posit that this is because written communication provides a higher degree of control, clarity, thinking time and sensory calm than FTF conversations [25, 26]. As a result, autistic individuals often rely on text-based digital communication modes, such as email and instant messaging features supported by social networking platforms, for interacting with others [27].\nGiven the popularity of text-based communication among autis- tic individuals, it becomes important to investigate whether the design of platforms that support text-based communication align with the needs and preferences of autistic individuals. A limited body of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature attempts to answer this question through exploratory studies. Bar- ros et al., in their critique of mainstream social media platforms, revealed that interpreting meaning and expressing emotional intent on social media platforms is particularly difficult for autistic users [6]. Page et al. reaffirmed these challenges, and emphasized that non-literal nuances, such as sarcasm and jokes, are even harder to comprehend [7]. It is well known that autistic individuals may exhibit a cognitive style that is characterized by a preference for literal thinking and a tendency to interpret information in a con- crete and straightforward manner [4]. Our research takes findings from these exploratory studies as a foundation to guide the design of an LLM-powered texting application tailored to cater to some of the challenges identified above."}, {"title": "2.2 AI Mediated Writing", "content": "Al has long been applied to enhance digital written communication. Writing assistants have traditionally been used to predict short, one word suggestions, like the next probable word in a phrase [28]."}, {"title": "2.3 Autism and Computing", "content": "Human-Computer Interaction researchers have been instrumental in developing new social support tools [12, 13] and therapeutic interventions [10, 11] for autistic individuals. Some of these tech- niques utilize simulations to create a controlled environment that enables users to safely explore and learn how to handle scenarios that could be challenging or risky in real life. For instance, Park et al. integrated an augmented reality (AR) interface with drama ther- apy to offer effective, universal, and accessible language therapy to autistic children [40], and Boyd et al. employed virtual reality (VR) to support proximity regulation for autistic individuals [41]. Prior research has also shown that use of technology promotes higher engagement among users [42], can be less resource-intensive com- pared to conventional therapy [43], and allows for customization that better addresses individual needs [44], moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.\nGiven that autism varies greatly from person to person, the level of customization existing tools provide falls short of what is truly needed, underscoring the need for rapidly adaptive systems capable of supporting real-time content generation [45]. In our study, we explore if recent advances in generative AI [22, 30] can meet these customization needs in the specific context of AI-assisted instant messaging. In addition, most tools aim to help autistic users in enhancing their social skills, overlooking the collaborative nature of social interactions. We discuss how social interactions can be conceptualized as fundamentally collaborative, and how this obser- vation motivates distributing the responsibility to reduce commu- nication breakdowns across all users."}, {"title": "3 OVERVIEW OF TWIPS", "content": "This section motivates the design of TwIPS and describes each of its three features."}, {"title": "3.1 Motivation", "content": "The design of Interpret, PREVIEW and SUGGEST is inspired by challenges and concerns raised by autistic individuals, in prior work, related to expressing and interpreting emotions and intent online [6, 7]. These challenges include frequently misinterpreting others, struggling to understand nuanced language, and difficulties in making oneself understood, which forces users to repeatedly read and revise what they want to write and align it with neu- rotypical communication styles. Without intensive proofreading, they could come off as blunt to others and trigger harsh reactions. These studies also highlight concerns over the extensive use of emo- jis and GIFs in text-based communication, as both carry nuanced, context-dependent meanings, and emojis are stylized versions of facial expressions which are hard to comprehend for many autis- tic individuals. Participants in our study reaffirmed many of these challenges."}, {"title": "3.2 Design and Functionality", "content": "The user interface (UI) of the TwIPS prototype resembles the layout of standard chatting applications, featuring separate chat bubbles for received and sent messages, a text input box, the recipient's name, and buttons for sending messages and accessing emojis, as shown in Figure 1. Participant's messages are displayed on the screen's right side in dark-grey chat bubbles, and incoming mes- sages are shown on the left side in light-grey chat bubbles. Addi- tional UI elements to support INTERPRET, PREVIEW and SUGGEST are described in detail in the subsequent subsections below. INTER- PRET is designed to help users in understanding messages from others, whereas PREVIEW and SUGGEST are intended to assist them in composing their own messages."}, {"title": "3.2.1 InterprET", "content": "This feature, as implied by its name, is designed to help users comprehend others' messages. It serves two functions: a) it describes the overall tone and meaning, and b) it individually identifies and explains ambiguous language elements, such as sar- casm, metaphors, and emojis, in incoming messages. A message containing ambiguous language elements is marked with a grey circular symbol in the upper left corner of its chat bubble, and users can hover over any chat bubble with this symbol to reveal the underlined ambiguous language element(s), as shown in Fig- ures 2a and 2b, respectively. Clicking on an underlined language element expands the chat bubble to reveal its meaning, and clicking anywhere else on the chat bubble expands it to show the overall tone and meaning of the message, as shown in Figures 2c and 2d, respectively. Only one type of explanation, either for ambiguous elements or the overall message, is displayed at a time."}, {"title": "3.2.2 PREVIEW", "content": "This feature is intended to help participants com- pose messages. It serves two primary functions. First, it enables users to preview recipients' likely emotional reaction to their mes- sage, helping them ensure the emotional tone of their message comes across as intended to the recipient and make adjustments to it if needed. Users can toggle it through the 'Preview' button positioned next to the emoji button. After toggling PREVIEW, a new text box appears below the message writing box to display the pre- view, which can be positive or negative, as shown in Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. The new text box disappears automatically once the user clicks on the 'Send' button or the cross symbol present on its far-right side. Second, PREVIEW flags messages as blunt or not blunt, whenever the user clicks the 'Preview' or 'Send' buttons. In the former scenario i.e., a message is flagged as blunt, it generates a negative preview and triggers SUGGEST to generate an alternative message. If the user still wants to send their original message, they can click on the 'Send' button again to bypasse PREVIEW's flagging functionality."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Suggest", "content": "This feature complements PREVIEW by generating a differently phrased but softer, or less blunt, alternate message for any message flagged as blunt by PREVIEW, while preserving the intent of the user's message in the alternative. The suggested mes- sage is appended to the feedback provided by PREVIEW, as shown in Figure 3b. Users can click on the 'Copy Button' to copy the sug- gestion to the message writing text box. PREVIEW and SUGGEST work in conjunction with one another, with PREVIEW providing an explanation as to why the user should consider the suggested alternative. PREVIEW bases its explanations off the most likely re- action/perspective of the recipient, with the hope that this will make them sound less corrective and more subjective as opposed to sounding instructional and rigid, ultimately leaving the decision to take or leave the suggested alternative up to the user."}, {"title": "3.3 Prompting Strategy", "content": "Writing effective prompts requires thorough testing and iterative re- finement to elicit dependable and accurate responses from the LLM. During development, we experimented with various prompts before finalizing the ones employed in our final prototype. The prompt templates used for each of the three features in TwIPS are provided in Appendix A. We used GPT4's code API (version: 1106-preview) through Microsoft Azure [46]. We applied few-shot learning to our prompts where possible, which is a well-known technique to design custom prompts by incorporating several examples of a task to guide a language model as it performs that task [20, 47, 48]. Additionally, we appended the entire conversational history to all prompts, ensuring the LLM had a comprehensive understanding of the conversation's context. We also made feature-specific modifica- tions to prompts where needed. In the prompt used with INTERPRET, we specified to check for emojis, figurative language, and phrases with an indirect meaning. The tone, meaning, and ambiguous lan- guage elements for each message were pre-fetched as soon as it was sent, but explanations for ambiguous language elements were fetched only when a user clicked on one. In the prompt used with SUGGEST, we made it explicit that the writing style and stance taken in the suggested alternative should match the writing style and stance of the user's original message. While we do not claim that these prompts are ideal, they were adequate for the purposes of our in-lab study within a controlled environment as they provided consistent, reliable results."}, {"title": "4 METHODOLOGY", "content": null}, {"title": "4.1 Recruitment", "content": "Participants were recruited from a university setting in USA, over a period of two months, through flyers posted in various build- ings around campus. Interested individuals completed a screening survey to ascertain their eligibility. The inclusion criteria were: a) being aged eighteen years or older b) fluency in English reading and writing c) ability to perform basic computer tasks, and d) having a formal autism diagnosis or self-identifying as autistic. Recogniz- ing disparities in access to diagnostic methods and procedures, we did not require a formal autism diagnosis to be eligible to partic- ipate in the study [49] similar to other recent studies involving neurodivergent populations [20, 50].\nA total of fourteen participants were recruited, out of which eight enrolled and completed the study. Table 1 shows information about the participants. Each user-study session lasted approximately two hours. Participants received an Amazon gift voucher worth twenty- five USD upon the study's completion. The study environment was a quiet room with adjustable lighting to accommodate participant needs. Additional accommodations, such as travel assistance or specific lighting requirements, if any, were identified through the screening survey and later addressed. This study adhered to ethical guidelines and was approved by the institition's Social, Behavioral, and Educational Research Institutional Review Board (IRB)."}, {"title": "4.2 User Study Overview", "content": "This sub-section outlines the design of our two-phased user study. The user-study was carefully designed to provide users with con- versational scenarios where they could utilize each of the three features in TwIPS, while ensuring user-autonomy, consistency and dynamicity across their experiences. Before each phase, participants received a handout detailing the prototype's features and tasks as- sociated with that phase, along with a demonstration by a member of the research team. Participants were free to ask questions at any time."}, {"title": "4.2.1 Phase One: A Scripted Conversational Scenario", "content": "In phase one, each participant engaged in a simulated one-on-one conversation with an imaginary character, Ben. To facilitate the simulation, the research team came up with a scripted conversation between Ben and participants prior to the study. The script centered around planning a birthday surprise for Jack, who was assumed to be a mutual friend of Ben and the participants. The same script was used for all participants and it is provided in Appendix B. Participants' messages in the script were a mix of blunt and non-blunt messages this was not revealed to them. These served as model responses that participants could send to Ben, and were revealed to them one-by-one, each paired with one of Ben's messages, as shown in Figure 4. Participants could either use the model response as-is, modify it, write a new response or choose the alternative suggested by SUGGEST when available, if they found the model response to be too blunt to send. Participants were given ample time to decide how they wanted to respond to Ben, explain the rationale behind their decision, and thoroughly describe their impressions of the model responses as well as the feedback and suggestions provided by PREVIEW and SUGGEST, respectively. Participants were encouraged to think aloud during phase one.\nWe imposed a number of constraints as part of phase one's design. First, we concealed the 'Preview' button from participants, SO PREVIEW was set to activate only automatically in phase 1 i.e., if a participant was blunt in their response to Ben, PREVIEW might flag and prevent it from getting sent. Second, we intentionally included several blunt messages in the set of model responses provided to participants. Third, participants were instructed that if they wanted to modify the model response, or write a new response, they should do so in a manner that might alter its wording/sentence structure but maintain its semantics/stance. This design let us examine, in an in-lab setting, how our participants prefer to communicate in situations demanding directness or bluntness, and their reactions to being nudged by PREVIEW and SUGGEST to revise their messages. At the same time, it granted participants the freedom to modify or rewrite their messages, decide whether to take up a suggestion or ignore it, and thoroughly explain the rationale behind their decisions."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Phase Two: A Nuanced Al-based Simulation", "content": "In phase two, participants initiated a second conversation with Ben with the goal to plan a trip with him to Gloucester, a waterfront city in Massachusetts. To aid participants in initiating the conversation, background information about notable destinations in Gloucester was provided to them. Participants were encouraged to compose messages in their own, unique writing styles. To simulate a more realistic and dynamic conversation, Ben was configured to be an AI-persona whose responses were dynamically generated on the fly via GPT4 in phase two.\nAdditionally, GPT4 was configured through prompts to intro- duce ambiguous language elements such as positive sarcasm, fig- urative language, emojis and jokes in its responses. This ensured that Ben's AI-persona acted in a way that prompted participants to use INTERPRET, thereby testing its capability to identify and explain ambiguous language elements. Contrasting with phase 1, where PREVIEW was set to activate only automatically, phase 2 offered participants the option to manually toggle it through the 'Preview' button, which they could click before sending a message. This en- abled us to observe how users interact with PREVIEW and SUGGEST when given more control. Participants were encouraged to explore and experiment with all 3 features to gain a holistic understanding of the application's features. In both phases, participants were in- formed that Ben was not a real human to allow them to stress our prototype with all kinds of messages without the fear of actually hurting him."}, {"title": "4.3 Data Collection and Analysis", "content": "Upon completing both phases of the study, participants took part in a semi-structured interview followed by a survey in the same sitting. The post-study semi-structured interview delved into participants' perceptions of TwIPS' usefulness and suggestions for improvement (based on how it helped or did not help them during the study) and their experience with traditional texting applications. Following the interview, participants completed a survey comprising 19 Likert- scale questions. Each question was rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 'Completely Disagree (1)' to 'Completely Agree (7)', with an additional option available for questions where standard options were not applicable. We adapted our survey design from the survey used by Goodman et al [20]. The survey results provided a holistic overview of user perceptions concerning each feature as well as the prototype as a whole, and qualitative insights helped explain them in detail. The primary themes in the survey included the prototype's usefulness, correctness, and impact on participants' sense of self- autonomy. Throughout the duration of the study, participant's audio and screen were recorded for later analysis. Written consent was obtained from each participant before the start of the study.\nGiven our small sample size (N=8), we state descriptive statistics with survey results, such as average and standard deviation, along with the verbatim survey question. To conduct qualitative analy- sis, we used Braun and Clarke's approach to thematic coding [51] using a deductive approach. Prior to the study, we developed a set of deductive codes to categorize: existing challenges with texting; communication style and preferences for self-expression and inter- pretation in text; positives, negatives, and improvements for each feature; and perceptions of self-autonomy and accessibility. A mem- ber of the research team transcribed the data and contextualised the transcripts with additional information from screen recordings. After importing the transcripts in NVivo, they extracted relevant quotes for each code, grouped these into themes, discussed the themes with other team members, and then reviewed and refined them. A second member, who was not part of the initial study team, validated the themes and the data associated with each theme. A similar approach was employed by Ahsen et. al [45]."}, {"title": "5 FINDINGS", "content": "In this section, we present background on participants' communica- tion styles and preferences, their reactions to the TwIPS prototype, and their suggestions for improving it. A summary of participants' qualitative feedback on the TwIPS prototype is provided in Table 2."}, {"title": "5.1 Communication Styles, Practices and Preferences", "content": null}, {"title": "5.1.1 Sustaining One's Weight", "content": "Most participants, including P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P8, demonstrated a strong inclination to main- tain their own weight in the conversation. In addition to making affirmations or negations to Ben's questions (Ben was the AI char- acter involved in the user study), participants made a conscious effort to pose their own questions and steer the conversation. In instances of disagreement or while expressing disinterest towards Ben's suggestions, they proposed alternative suggestions to prevent the burden of generating new ideas from falling on Ben. At one such instance, Ben asked P4 if they knew Jack's (Jack was assumed to be a mutual friend of Ben and the participant) birthday was com- ing up, and P4 remarked, \"A response like 'Yeah, I know!' will shut down the conversation and put the burden on Ben to decide what to talk about next. I'll add 'Should we do something [to celebrate Jack's birthday]?' to my response\". P8 resonated with this remark. More- over, P1 highlighted the struggle to maintain balance in text-based conversations is a common challenge faced by autistic individu- als, \"Maintaining a balance in text messages is difficult. We often respond directly to the question posed without contributing equally to the conversation's flow. When I talk to people who are not autistic, their biggest complaint when texting autistic people all the time is: I feel like they do not want to talk to me because they only answer my question but never continue the conversation\". In this way, a key aspect of participants' thought process involved recognizing that simply disagreeing without offering alternatives, or responding to questions without prompting further discussion, might shift the burden of maintaining the conversation's momentum onto others."}, {"title": "5.1.2 Clarity and Directness", "content": "Numerous participants, specifically P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8, shared that they strive to text in a clear and direct manner, with the aim of minimizing the chances of being misinterpreted by others. P4 emphasized it was neces- sary to communicate clearly and directly, particularly with other neurodivergent individuals, as even slight ambiguities could result in them getting caught in a non-stop cycle of overthinking. For P5, being straightforward and concise reduced the chances of mis- interpretation in general too, \"...the fewer words you use and the more to the point it [the message] is, there are less extra things for people to misinterpret.\" Conversely, P4, P6, and P2 asserted being direct might not be suitable in certain scenarios, like interactions with unfamiliar people or in the midst of disagreements. When P4 wanted to express disinterest in Ben's suggestion, they explained, \"Since I don't know Ben very well, I'm not going to push hard on his expressed preference. If it was someone I knew well, I might be more blunt.\" In this way, participants highlighted the importance of clarity and directness in texting, emphasizing that the level of directness must be adjusted according to the situational context for effective communication."}, {"title": "5.1.3 Masking in Text", "content": "Masking entails consciously or unconsciously altering one's behavior to conform to societal expectations - autis- tic individuals often feel the need to mask while interacting with neurotypical individuals. Our participants explained the different factors they consider and strategies they use to effectively mask in text. P3 believed it was necessary to mask with strangers until a rea- sonable level of familiarity was reached, at which point they could reveal their true communication style without fear of judgement. For P4, masking needed to be done more pervasively to adhere to social norms, and P1 rewrote any message they needed to mask. This was a flexibility afforded by texting, unlike in FTF interactions where words are spoken without the opportunity for revision, \"I typically start typing out my response, and then if I realize that I need to mask, I end up fully rewriting it. It's the same idea of like turning everything into sounding nice even when you aren't being nice\". P4 likened masking to a \"transparency slider\", explaining how they adjust it to reveal varying degrees of their personality in different contexts or selectively display certain aspects of it. P4 and P7 stressed on the significance of maintaining authenticity while masking, with P4 stating, \"If you just copy somebody with your masking, then you look like somebody else, and people will always interact with you that way. Whereas, if you make it yours, but more like a translator than a cover, then it's more like you, except under- standable to people who are not\". This illustrates that autistic users mask to conform to the norms of text-based conversation, which can differ significantly from those of FTF conversations, and make a concerted effort to preserve the authenticity of their writing style."}, {"title": "5.1.4 Punctuation and Crutches", "content": "P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P7 pointed out that punctuation plays a key role in tone interpretation and the personalization of one's writing style. P1 associated imperfect punc- tuation and spelling with an amicable or colloquial tone, and linked precise punctuation, such as using a single question mark instead of several, to seriousness and stronger emotions like bluntness or annoyance. For P2 and P5, exclamation points typically signalled positivity and excitement, unless the message inherently carried a negative meaning. P4 and P7 consistently capitalized the first letter of each word in the message and avoided slang, as they believed that using non-standard words and incorrect punctuation made the messages sound unlike their authentic self. P4 expressed, \"That doesn't sound like me. So, I would never, ever send a message that had non-existent words\". Furthermore, P1 and P2 employed conver- sational aids to more accurately express their tone. P2 mentioned that sometimes they include a disclaimer when feeling too fatigued to invest the effort required to articulately phrase their message. The disclaimer was basically a follow-up message, requesting the recipient to interpret the previous message in the specific tone in- tended by the sender. Similarly, P1 noted they frequently include extra 'context' to explain their punctuation choices. By 'context', P1 meant adding tone indicators like '/sarcastic' and '/excited' at the end of their messages to clearly convey the intended tone, \"I often put a lot of context in my message, because messaging people is very stressful... if I use a specific punctuation mark, I'll explain its purpose\"."}, {"title": "5.1.5 Resolution Strategies", "content": "Based on past experience, participants reported it was challenging for them to discern tone and mean- ing within their own text messages, as well others' messages. To counteract this, they adopted a range of strategies. P1 shared that sometimes, they seek help from their close friends before sending out a message or email, \"I will send it [a screenshot] to people and be like: does this sound okay? And they'll be like: that sounds like you're heavily critiquing that person. You should definitely change xyz things. So, it takes me a long time, because I have to rewrite a lot of what I say.\". For P3 and P6, vocalizing other's messages enhanced their understanding of the intended tone. P2, P3 and P7 preferred to inquire the sender directly to avoid making any assumptions or misinterpretations about their tone, while P5 felt it was better to resolve ambiguities in person, expressing worry that trying to clarify something over text could further add to the confusion, \"I'm uncertain if Ben is being passive-aggressive. Confronting him might just complicate things if he's not actually being that way. So, I won't bring it up, at least not over text\"."}, {"title": "5.2 Feedback on the TwIPS Prototype", "content": null}, {"title": "5.2.1 Reactions to INTERPRET", "content": "Seeking Clarification. For multiple participants, interpreting tone and meaning in text was challenging and often necessitated clarifi- cation from the sender. In instances where asking for clarification was not possible, participants expressed INTERPET could be incredi- bly helpful. Specifically, P3 underscored its utility in group chats and on dating apps. \"In group chats, when you're not part of the ongoing conversation, it's hard to tell if you're missing context\", and INTERPRET could help with clarifications without directly inquiring the sender in front of other groups members. As a user of dating apps, P3 identified flirting over text as a challenge, \"flirting depends on subtlety and one-on-one responses - the difficulty lies in knowing when to shift the conversation or topic\". They emphasized \"first im- pressions are basically everything\" in this context, and INTERPRET could play a pivotal role in helping users understand innuendos and ensuring responses align with the intended tone, thereby helping them \"say the right thing\" and navigate the \"make-or-break\" nature of initial interactions more effectively. Similarly, P5 and P2 felt that INTERPRET could be beneficial in the initial stages of talking to or befriending strangers. Perhaps, P1 believed INTERPRET could potentially benefit both neurotypical and autistic users, explaining \"people who don't feel comfortable asking for clarification could ben- efit from it, as well as neurotypical individuals, for whom having to constantly explain their tone can get annoying\". Overall, participants strongly agreed (avg. = 6, s.d = 1.07) with the statement, \"The ap- plication's interpret feature enabled me to better understand the overall tone and meaning of messages\" in the post-study survey.\nINTERPRET or Tone Indicators. Some participants compared IN- TERPRET to using tone indicators. Tone indicators are short abbrevi- ations used at the end of a message to clarify the sender's emotional tone, helping the receiver understand the intended sentiment, such as seriousness, sarcasm, or humor. For example, \"/s\" indicates sar- casm, while \"/j\" denotes joking. P6 described tone indicators as \"pretty vague because they are limited to a small number of high-level adjectives like 'sarcastic' or 'joking'\", and liked how INTERPRET, on the other hand, is more nuanced as it \"uses multiple, very specific adjectives\" to describe tone. For P6, one's understanding of tone sig- nificantly influenced their interpretation of the message's meaning. Since INTERPRET not only provided tone but also the meaning, it made this connection clearer; for this reason, they believed INTER- PRET surpassed the clarity provided by tone indicators. While P2 might not utilize INTERPRET for every message, they saw its value in moments where they would want to double-check their under- standing, particularly when dealing with sarcasm or metaphors.\nAmbiguous Language Elements. In addition to clarifying the over- all tone and meaning, INTERPRET was designed to identify and ex- plain ambiguous language elements, such as figurative phrases and emojis. P2 appreciated how the two features were subtly integrated, \"the underlined phrases only appear when I hover over the message, rather than bombarding me with them. This makes the experience less overwhelming and more user-friendly\". P4 found the underlining helpful as \"sometimes it's hard to even identify the emoji\", however, they expressed concern that if too many components in a message were ambiguous, it would be \"anxiety inducing to have all of them underlined\". For P2, P6, and P8 the ability to delve into specific phrases added value in its own right, because one could grasp the gist of the message but might lack understanding of certain phrases within it. P2 argued \"the more information provided, the better, as there might be instances where I grasp the overall meaning but not specific phrases or emojis in the message, such as 'pops on the beach' [a phrase Ben used that P2 did not know of]\".\nMoreover, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7 and P8 saw value in INTERPRET'S ability to explain emojis. For P2, \"using the skull emoji to indicate laughter rather than the usual laughing emoji can be confusing, so having emoji explanations along with the context in which it's com- monly used was really helpful\". P4 appreciated the range of emojis INTERPRET covered, and how it handled emojis combinations, \"the range of emojis it can explain is excellent. I like how emoji combina- tions are explained differently, because the meanings of individual emojis can change when combined\". Having emoji explanations up- front was convenient for P1, and P4 echoed this sentiment, \"it's possible to search for phrases elsewhere, but having immediate expla- nations especially for emojis, that are challenging to look up, is very convenient\". Conversely, P1 and P5 deemed explanations of individ- ual language elements redundant. P1 attributed this to the nature of emojis Ben employed in their interaction, which they found to be self-explanatory, \"Ben seemed to use emojis not as word replacements but more as expressions of excitement, silliness, or perhaps just for the novelty\". Overall, participants strongly agreed (avg. = 6.5, s.d = 0.76) with the statement, \"The application's interpret feature correctly interpreted the overall tone and meaning of messages, taking into account the conversation's context.\""}, {"title": "5.2.2 Reactions to PREVIEW", "content": "Facilitating Reflection.

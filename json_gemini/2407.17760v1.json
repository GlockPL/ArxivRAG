{"title": "TwIPS: A Large Language Model Powered Texting Application to Simplify Conversational Nuances for Autistic Users", "authors": ["Rukhshan Haroon", "Fahad Dogar"], "abstract": "Autistic individuals often experience difficulties in conveying and interpreting emotional tone and non-literal nuances. Many also mask\u00b9 their communication style to avoid being misconstrued by others, spending considerable time and mental effort in the pro-cess. To address these challenges in text-based communication, we present TwIPS2, a prototype texting application powered by a large language model (LLM), which can assist users with: a) deciphering tone and meaning of incoming messages, b) ensuring the emotional tone of their message is in line with their intent, and c) coming up with alternate phrasing for messages that could be misconstrued and received negatively by others. We leverage an AI-based simulation and a conversational script to evaluate TwIPS with 8 autistic participants in an in-lab setting. Our findings show TwIPS enables a convenient way for participants to seek clarifications, provides a better alternative to tone indicators, and facilitates constructive reflection on writing technique and style. We also examine how autistic users utilize language for self-expression and interpretation in instant messaging, and gather feedback for enhancing our prototype. We conclude with a discussion around balancing user-autonomy with Al-mediation, establishing appropriate trust levels in Al systems, and autistic users' customization needs in the context of AI-assisted communication.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental disorder characterized by challenges in verbal and nonverbal communication, difficulties in social interactions, repetitive behaviors, and/or sensory sensitivities [1, 2].

Howard et al. conducted a study involving 245 autistic adult participants, and on average, these individuals selected email and text-messaging as their preferred modes of communication over FTF conversations [4]. Nicolaidis et al. showed that there existed a link between the per-ceived success of healthcare interactions among autistic adults and the availability of written communication options [5]. Researchers posit that this is because written communication provides a higher degree of control, clarity, thinking time and sensory calm than FTF conversations [25, 26]. As a result, autistic individuals often rely on text-based digital communication modes, such as email and instant messaging features supported by social networking platforms, for interacting with others [27].\nGiven the popularity of text-based communication among autis-tic individuals, it becomes important to investigate whether the design of platforms that support text-based communication align with the needs and preferences of autistic individuals. A limited body of research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literature attempts to answer this question through exploratory studies. Bar-ros et al., in their critique of mainstream social media platforms, revealed that interpreting meaning and expressing emotional intent on social media platforms is particularly difficult for autistic users [6]. Page et al. reaffirmed these challenges, and emphasized that non-literal nuances, such as sarcasm and jokes, are even harder to comprehend [7]. It is well known that autistic individuals may exhibit a cognitive style that is characterized by a preference for literal thinking and a tendency to interpret information in a con-crete and straightforward manner [4]. Our research takes findings from these exploratory studies as a foundation to guide the design of an LLM-powered texting application tailored to cater to some of the challenges identified above."}, {"title": "2.2 AI Mediated Writing", "content": "Al has long been applied to enhance digital written communication. Writing assistants have traditionally been used to predict short, one word suggestions, like the next probable word in a phrase [28]."}, {"title": "2.3 Autism and Computing", "content": "Human-Computer Interaction researchers have been instrumental in developing new social support tools [12, 13] and therapeutic interventions [10, 11] for autistic individuals. Some of these tech-niques utilize simulations to create a controlled environment that enables users to safely explore and learn how to handle scenarios that could be challenging or risky in real life. For instance, Park et al. integrated an augmented reality (AR) interface with drama ther-apy to offer effective, universal, and accessible language therapy to autistic children [40], and Boyd et al. employed virtual reality (VR) to support proximity regulation for autistic individuals [41]. Prior research has also shown that use of technology promotes higher engagement among users [42], can be less resource-intensive com-pared to conventional therapy [43], and allows for customization that better addresses individual needs [44], moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach.\nGiven that autism varies greatly from person to person, the level of customization existing tools provide falls short of what is truly needed, underscoring the need for rapidly adaptive systems capable of supporting real-time content generation [45]. In our study, we explore if recent advances in generative AI [22, 30] can meet these customization needs in the specific context of AI-assisted instant messaging. In addition, most tools aim to help autistic users in enhancing their social skills, overlooking the collaborative nature of social interactions. We discuss how social interactions can be conceptualized as fundamentally collaborative, and how this obser-vation motivates distributing the responsibility to reduce commu-nication breakdowns across all users."}, {"title": "3 OVERVIEW OF TWIPS", "content": "This section motivates the design of TwIPS and describes each of its three features."}, {"title": "3.1 Motivation", "content": "The design of Interpret, PREVIEW and SUGGEST is inspired by challenges and concerns raised by autistic individuals, in prior work, related to expressing and interpreting emotions and intent online [6, 7]. These challenges include frequently misinterpreting others, struggling to understand nuanced language, and difficulties in making oneself understood, which forces users to repeatedly read and revise what they want to write and align it with neu-rotypical communication styles. Without intensive proofreading, they could come off as blunt to others and trigger harsh reactions. These studies also highlight concerns over the extensive use of emo-jis and GIFs in text-based communication, as both carry nuanced, context-dependent meanings, and emojis are stylized versions of facial expressions which are hard to comprehend for many autis-tic individuals. Participants in our study reaffirmed many of these challenges."}, {"title": "3.2 Design and Functionality", "content": "The user interface (UI) of the TwIPS prototype resembles the layout of standard chatting applications, featuring separate chat bubbles for received and sent messages, a text input box, the recipient's name, and buttons for sending messages and accessing emojis, as shown in Figure 1. Participant's messages are displayed on the screen's right side in dark-grey chat bubbles, and incoming mes-sages are shown on the left side in light-grey chat bubbles. Addi-tional UI elements to support INTERPRET, PREVIEW and SUGGEST are described in detail in the subsequent subsections below. INTER-PRET is designed to help users in understanding messages from others, whereas PREVIEW and SUGGEST are intended to assist them in composing their own messages."}, {"title": "3.2.1 InterprET", "content": "This feature, as implied by its name, is designed to help users comprehend others' messages. It serves two functions: a) it describes the overall tone and meaning, and b) it individually identifies and explains ambiguous language elements, such as sar-casm, metaphors, and emojis, in incoming messages. A message containing ambiguous language elements is marked with a grey circular symbol in the upper left corner of its chat bubble, and users can hover over any chat bubble with this symbol to reveal the underlined ambiguous language element(s), as shown in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. Clicking on an underlined language element expands the chat bubble to reveal its meaning, and clicking anywhere else on the chat bubble expands it to show the overall tone and meaning of the message, as shown in Figures 2c and 2d, respectively. Only one type of explanation, either for ambiguous elements or the overall message, is displayed at a time."}, {"title": "3.2.2 PREVIEW", "content": "This feature is intended to help participants com-pose messages. It serves two primary functions. First, it enables users to preview recipients' likely emotional reaction to their mes-sage, helping them ensure the emotional tone of their message comes across as intended to the recipient and make adjustments to it if needed. Users can toggle it through the 'Preview' button positioned next to the emoji button. After toggling PREVIEW, a new text box appears below the message writing box to display the pre-view, which can be positive or negative, as shown in Figures 3a and 3b, respectively. The new text box disappears automatically once the user clicks on the 'Send' button or the cross symbol present on its far-right side. Second, PREVIEW flags messages as blunt or not blunt, whenever the user clicks the 'Preview' or 'Send' buttons. In the former scenario i.e., a message is flagged as blunt, it generates a negative preview and triggers SUGGEST to generate an alternative message. If the user still wants to send their original message, they can click on the 'Send' button again to bypasse PREVIEW's flagging functionality."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Suggest", "content": "This feature complements PREVIEW by generating a differently phrased but softer, or less blunt, alternate message for any message flagged as blunt by PREVIEW, while preserving the intent of the user's message in the alternative. The suggested mes-sage is appended to the feedback provided by PREVIEW, as shown in Figure 3b. Users can click on the 'Copy Button' to copy the sug-gestion to the message writing text box. PREVIEW and SUGGEST work in conjunction with one another, with PREVIEW providing an explanation as to why the user should consider the suggested alternative. PREVIEW bases its explanations off the most likely re-action/perspective of the recipient, with the hope that this will make them sound less corrective and more subjective as opposed to sounding instructional and rigid, ultimately leaving the decision to take or leave the suggested alternative up to the user."}, {"title": "3.3 Prompting Strategy", "content": "Writing effective prompts requires thorough testing and iterative re-finement to elicit dependable and accurate responses from the LLM. During development, we experimented with various prompts before finalizing the ones employed in our final prototype. The prompt templates used for each of the three features in TwIPS are provided in Appendix A. We used GPT4's code API (version: 1106-preview) through Microsoft Azure [46]. We applied few-shot learning to our prompts where possible, which is a well-known technique to design custom prompts by incorporating several examples of a task to guide a language model as it performs that task [20, 47, 48]. Additionally, we appended the entire conversational history to all prompts, ensuring the LLM had a comprehensive understanding of the conversation's context. We also made feature-specific modifica-tions to prompts where needed. In the prompt used with INTERPRET, we specified to check for emojis, figurative language, and phrases with an indirect meaning. The tone, meaning, and ambiguous lan-guage elements for each message were pre-fetched as soon as it was sent, but explanations for ambiguous language elements were fetched only when a user clicked on one. In the prompt used with SUGGEST, we made it explicit that the writing style and stance taken in the suggested alternative should match the writing style and stance of the user's original message. While we do not claim that these prompts are ideal, they were adequate for the purposes of our in-lab study within a controlled environment as they provided consistent, reliable results."}, {"title": "4 METHODOLOGY", "content": "This sub-section outlines the design of our two-phased user study.

Interested individuals completed a screening survey to ascertain their eligibility. The inclusion criteria were: a) being aged eighteen years or older b) fluency in English reading and writing c) ability to perform basic computer tasks, and d) having a formal autism diagnosis or self-identifying as autistic. Recogniz-ing disparities in access to diagnostic methods and procedures, we did not require a formal autism diagnosis to be eligible to partic-ipate in the study [49] similar to other recent studies involving neurodivergent populations [20, 50]."}, {"title": "4.2 User Study Overview", "content": "hours.

To facilitate the simulation, the research team came up with a scripted conversation between Ben and participants prior to the study. The script centered around planning a birthday surprise for Jack, who was assumed to be a mutual friend of Ben and the participants. The same script was used for all participants and it is provided in Appendix B. Participants' messages in the script were a mix of blunt and non-blunt messages this was not revealed to them. These served as model responses that participants could send to Ben, and were revealed to them one-by-one, each paired with one of Ben's messages, as shown in Figure 4. Participants could either use the model response as-is, modify it, write a new response or choose the alternative suggested by SUGGEST when available, if they found the model response to be too blunt to send. Participants were given ample time to decide how they wanted to respond to Ben, explain the rationale behind their decision, and thoroughly describe their impressions of the model responses as well as the feedback and suggestions provided by PREVIEW and SUGGEST, respectively. Participants were encouraged to think aloud during phase one.\nWe imposed a number of constraints as part of phase one's design. First, we concealed the 'Preview' button from participants, SO PREVIEW was set to activate only automatically in phase 1 i.e., if a participant was blunt in their response to Ben, PREVIEW might flag and prevent it from getting sent. Second, we intentionally included several blunt messages in the set of model responses provided to participants. Third, participants were instructed that if they wanted to modify the model response, or write a new response, they should do so in a manner that might alter its wording/sentence structure but maintain its semantics/stance. This design let us examine, in an in-lab setting, how our participants prefer to communicate in situations demanding directness or bluntness, and their reactions to being nudged by PREVIEW and SUGGEST to revise their messages. At the same time, it granted participants the freedom to modify or rewrite their messages, decide whether to take up a suggestion or ignore it, and thoroughly explain the rationale behind their decisions."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Phase Two: A Nuanced Al-based Simulation", "content": "In phase two, participants initiated a second conversation with Ben with the goal to plan a trip with him to Gloucester, a waterfront city in Massachusetts. To aid participants in initiating the conversation, background information about notable destinations in Gloucester was provided to them. Participants were encouraged to compose messages in their own, unique writing styles. To simulate a more realistic and dynamic conversation, Ben was configured to be an Al-persona whose responses were dynamically generated on the fly via GPT4 in phase two.\nAdditionally, GPT4 was configured through prompts to intro-duce ambiguous language elements such as positive sarcasm, fig-urative language, emojis and jokes in its responses. This ensured that Ben's AI-persona acted in a way that prompted participants to use INTERPRET, thereby testing its capability to identify and explain ambiguous language elements. Contrasting with phase 1, where PREVIEW was set to activate only automatically, phase 2 offered participants the option to manually toggle it through the 'Preview' button, which they could click before sending a message. This en-abled us to observe how users interact with PREVIEW and SUGGEST when given more control. Participants were encouraged to explore and experiment with all 3 features to gain a holistic understanding of the application's features. In both phases, participants were in-formed that Ben was not a real human to allow them to stress our prototype with all kinds of messages without the fear of actually hurting him."}, {"title": "4.3 Data Collection and Analysis", "content": "Upon completing both phases of the study, participants took part in a semi-structured interview followed by a survey in the same sitting.

Most participants, including P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P8, demonstrated a strong inclination to main-tain their own weight in the conversation. In addition to making affirmations or negations to Ben's questions (Ben was the AI char-acter involved in the user study), participants made a conscious effort to pose their own questions and steer the conversation. In instances of disagreement or while expressing disinterest towards Ben's suggestions, they proposed alternative suggestions to prevent the burden of generating new ideas from falling on Ben. At one such instance, Ben asked P4 if they knew Jack's (Jack was assumed to be a mutual friend of Ben and the participant) birthday was com-ing up, and P4 remarked, \"A response like 'Yeah, I know!' will shut down the conversation and put the burden on Ben to decide what to talk about next. I'll add 'Should we do something [to celebrate Jack's birthday]?' to my response\". P8 resonated with this remark. More-over, P1 highlighted the struggle to maintain balance in text-based conversations is a common challenge faced by autistic individu-als, \"Maintaining a balance in text messages is difficult. We often respond directly to the question posed without contributing equally to the conversation's flow. When I talk to people who are not autistic, their biggest complaint when texting autistic people all the time is: I feel like they do not want to talk to me because they only answer my question but never continue the conversation\". In this way, a key aspect of participants' thought process involved recognizing that simply disagreeing without offering alternatives, or responding to questions without prompting further discussion, might shift the burden of maintaining the conversation's momentum onto others."}, {"title": "5.1.2 Clarity and Directness", "content": "Numerous participants, specifically P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8, shared that they strive to text in a clear and direct manner, with the aim of minimizing the chances of being misinterpreted by others. P4 emphasized it was neces-sary to communicate clearly and directly, particularly with other neurodivergent individuals, as even slight ambiguities could result in them getting caught in a non-stop cycle of overthinking. For P5, being straightforward and concise reduced the chances of mis-interpretation in general too, \"...the fewer words you use and the more to the point it [the message] is, there are less extra things for people to misinterpret.\" Conversely, P4, P6, and P2 asserted being direct might not be suitable in certain scenarios, like interactions with unfamiliar people or in the midst of disagreements. When P4 wanted to express disinterest in Ben's suggestion, they explained, \"Since I don't know Ben very well, I'm not going to push hard on his expressed preference. If it was someone I knew well, I might be more blunt.\" In this way, participants highlighted the importance of clarity and directness in texting, emphasizing that the level of directness must be adjusted according to the situational context for effective communication."}, {"title": "5.1.3 Masking in Text", "content": "Masking entails consciously or unconsciously altering one's behavior to conform to societal expectations - autis-tic individuals often feel the need to mask while interacting with neurotypical individuals. Our participants explained the different factors they consider and strategies they use to effectively mask in text. P3 believed it was necessary to mask with strangers until a rea-sonable level of familiarity was reached, at which point they could reveal their true communication style without fear of judgement. For P4, masking needed to be done more pervasively to adhere to social norms, and P1 rewrote any message they needed to mask. This was a flexibility afforded by texting, unlike in FTF interactions where words are spoken without the opportunity for revision, \"I typically start typing out my response, and then if I realize that I need to mask, I end up fully rewriting it. It's the same idea of like turning everything into sounding nice even when you aren't being nice\". P4 likened masking to a \"transparency slider\", explaining how they adjust it to reveal varying degrees of their personality in different contexts or selectively display certain aspects of it. P4 and P7 stressed on the significance of maintaining authenticity while masking, with P4 stating, \"If you just copy somebody with your masking, then you look like somebody else, and people will always interact with you that way. Whereas, if you make it yours, but more like a translator than a cover, then it's more like you, except under-standable to people who are not\". This illustrates that autistic users mask to conform to the norms of text-based conversation, which can differ significantly from those of FTF conversations, and make a concerted effort to preserve the authenticity of their writing style."}, {"title": "5.1.4 Punctuation and Crutches", "content": "P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P7 pointed out that punctuation plays a key role in tone interpretation and the personalization of one's writing style. P1 associated imperfect punc-tuation and spelling with an amicable or colloquial tone, and linked precise punctuation, such as using a single question mark instead of several, to seriousness and stronger emotions like bluntness or annoyance. For P2 and P5, exclamation points typically signalled positivity and excitement, unless the message inherently carried a negative meaning. P4 and P7 consistently capitalized the first letter of each word in the message and avoided slang, as they believed that using non-standard words and incorrect punctuation made the messages sound unlike their authentic self. P4 expressed, \"That doesn't sound like me. So, I would never, ever send a message that had non-existent words\". Furthermore, P1 and P2 employed conver-sational aids to more accurately express their tone. P2 mentioned that sometimes they include a disclaimer when feeling too fatigued to invest the effort required to articulately phrase their message. The disclaimer was basically a follow-up message, requesting the recipient to interpret the previous message in the specific tone in-tended by the sender. Similarly, P1 noted they frequently include extra 'context' to explain their punctuation choices. By 'context', P1 meant adding tone indicators like '/sarcastic' and '/excited' at the end of their messages to clearly convey the intended tone, \"I often put a lot of context in my message, because messaging people is very stressful... if I use a specific punctuation mark, I'll explain its purpose\"."}, {"title": "5.1.5 Resolution Strategies", "content": "Based on past experience, participants reported it was challenging for them to discern tone and mean-ing within their own text messages, as well others' messages. To counteract this, they adopted a range of strategies. P1 shared that sometimes, they seek help from their close friends before sending out a message or email, \"I will send it [a screenshot] to people and be like: does this sound okay? And they'll be like: that sounds like you're heavily critiquing that person. You should definitely change xyz things. So, it takes me a long time, because I have to rewrite a lot of what I say.\". For P3 and P6, vocalizing other's messages enhanced their understanding of the intended tone. P2, P3 and P7 preferred to inquire the sender directly to avoid making any assumptions or misinterpretations about their tone, while P5 felt it was better to resolve ambiguities in person, expressing worry that trying to clarify something over text could further add to the confusion, \"I'm uncertain if Ben is being passive-aggressive. Confronting him might just complicate things if he's not actually being that way. So, I won't bring it up, at least not over text\"."}, {"title": "5.2 Feedback on the TwIPS Prototype", "content": "5.2.1 Reactions to INTERPRET.\nSeeking Clarification. For multiple participants, interpreting tone and meaning in text was challenging and often necessitated clarifi-cation from the sender. In instances where asking for clarification was not possible, participants expressed INTERPET could be incredi-bly helpful. Specifically, P3 underscored its utility in group chats and on dating apps. \"In group chats, when you're not part of the ongoing conversation, it's hard to tell if you're missing context\", and INTERPRET could help with clarifications without directly inquiring the sender in front of other groups members. As a user of dating apps, P3 identified flirting over text as a challenge, \"flirting depends on subtlety and one-on-one responses - the difficulty lies in knowing when to shift the conversation or topic\". They emphasized \"first im-pressions are basically everything\" in this context, and INTERPRET could play a pivotal role in helping users understand innuendos and ensuring responses align with the intended tone, thereby helping them \"say the right thing\" and navigate the \"make-or-break\" nature of initial interactions more effectively. Similarly, P5 and P2 felt that INTERPRET could be beneficial in the initial stages of talking to or befriending strangers. Perhaps, P1 believed INTERPRET could potentially benefit both neurotypical and autistic users, explaining \"people who don't feel comfortable asking for clarification could ben-efit from it, as well as neurotypical individuals, for whom having to constantly explain their tone can get annoying\". Overall, participants strongly agreed (avg. = 6, s.d = 1.07) with the statement, \"The ap-plication's interpret feature enabled me to better understand the overall tone and meaning of messages\" in the post-study survey.\nINTERPRET or Tone Indicators. Some participants compared IN-TERPRET to using tone indicators. Tone indicators are short abbrevi-ations used at the end of a message to clarify the sender's emotional tone, helping the receiver understand the intended sentiment, such as seriousness, sarcasm, or humor. For example, \"/s\" indicates sar-casm, while \"/j\" denotes joking. P6 described tone indicators as \"pretty vague because they are limited to a small number of high-level adjectives like 'sarcastic' or 'joking'\", and liked how INTERPRET, on the other hand, is more nuanced as it \"uses multiple, very specific adjectives\" to describe tone. For P6, one's understanding of tone sig-nificantly influenced their interpretation of the message's meaning. Since INTERPRET not only provided tone but also the meaning, it made this connection clearer; for this reason, they believed INTER-PRET surpassed the clarity provided by tone indicators. While P2 might not utilize INTERPRET for every message, they saw its value in moments where they would want to double-check their under-standing, particularly when dealing with sarcasm or metaphors.\nAmbiguous Language Elements. In addition to clarifying the over-all tone and meaning, INTERPRET was designed to identify and ex-plain ambiguous language elements, such as figurative phrases and emojis. P2 appreciated how the two features were subtly integrated, \"the underlined phrases only appear when I hover over the message, rather than bombarding me with them. This makes the experience less overwhelming and more user-friendly\". P4 found the underlining helpful as \"sometimes it's hard to even identify the emoji\", however, they expressed concern that if too many components in a message were ambiguous, it would be \"anxiety inducing to have all of them underlined\". For P2, P6, and P8 the ability to delve into specific phrases added value in its own right, because one could grasp the gist of the message but might lack understanding of certain phrases within it. P2 argued \"the more information provided, the better, as there might be instances where I grasp the overall meaning but not specific phrases or emojis in the message, such as 'pops on the beach' [a phrase Ben used that P2 did not know of]\". Moreover, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7 and P8 saw value in INTERPRET'S ability to explain emojis. For P2, \"using the skull emoji to indicate laughter rather than the usual laughing emoji can be confusing, so having emoji explanations along with the context in which it's com-monly used was really helpful\". P4 appreciated the range of emojis INTERPRET covered, and how it handled emojis combinations, \"the range of emojis it can explain is excellent. I like how emoji combina-tions are explained differently, because the meanings of individual emojis can change when combined\". Having emoji explanations up-front was convenient for P1, and P4 echoed this sentiment, \"it's possible to search for phrases elsewhere, but having immediate expla-nations especially for emojis, that are challenging to look up, is very convenient\". Conversely, P1 and P5 deemed explanations of individ-ual language elements redundant. P1 attributed this to the nature of emojis Ben employed in their interaction, which they found to be self-explanatory, \"Ben seemed to use emojis not as word replacements but more as expressions of excitement, silliness, or perhaps just for the novelty\". Overall, participants strongly agreed (avg. = 6.5, s.d = 0.76) with the statement, \"The application's interpret feature correctly interpreted the overall tone and meaning of messages, taking into account the conversation's context.\""}, {"title": "5.2.2 Reactions to PREVIEW", "content": "Facilitating Reflection. Participants were of the view that PRE-VIEW facilitated constructive reflection on writing technique and style. P4 identified reflection as a vital part of learning to commu-nicate effectively and independently, \"PREVIEW helps me develop a mental model of what others might find rude, dismissive, or offensive, going beyond resolving a single incident. It's so important to know why something is bad in order to be able to pattern match for future\". P2 and P6 echoed this sentiment, describing that PREVIEW helped them identify aspects of their messages that could be improved but were overlooked by them. For example, P6 stated, \"PREVIEW made me aware of how I might be suggesting my preferences as the only options without considering Ben's choice\". Similarly, P2 observed, \"I thought my message was good - but then PREVIEW made me realise what was off\". P4 expressed that PREVIEW not only helped them find areas for improvement, but also indicated how to make those im-provements. For instance, P4 found value in the advise to gradually lead into the chat while initializing their chat with Ben, \"guidance on prefacing my main points has been incredibly beneficial. It has prompted me to consider the extent of introductory conversation neces-sary before diving into the main topic\". In addition, P1 differentiated her experience as an autistic woman from that of autistic men, \"as women, a lot of our language is already expected to be curved, like our emails have to have exclamation points and, you know, we have to try really hard to sound kind. I feel like this [PREVIEW] would benefit a lot of the autistic men that I know. It would enable useful self-reflection that a lot of autistic men, I think, need. A lot of autistic women are diagnosed later in life, and at that point they have learnt to mask really effectively. So many women, including myself, have mitigated the problems that this is trying to solve in a variety of ways. But I don't know a single autistic man, and I know a good amount, that wouldn't benefit from this\". P1 further expressed that before sending an email or message, they often obtain feedback on it from others, and PREVIEW was a more convenient way for doing the same thing, \"right now, I require the help of a community [close friends] where I have to send them a screenshot and be like does this sound okay to you?\". Overall, participants expressed strong agreement (avg. = 6.63, s.d = 0.74) with the statement, \"The application's preview feature can help prevent misunderstandings as it enables users to preview recipients' likely response to their message and make adjustments to it before sending.\"\nTo Toggle or Not. In phase 1 of the user study, PREVIEW was configured to activate automatically for blunt messages. In phase 2, participants were given the option to toggle PREVIEW via a button before sending a message, in addition to it activating automatically. Participants held mixed opinions on whether they should have the option to manually toggle PREVIEW. P8 compared PREVIEW with their current approach to effective communication, \"There's a little checklist in my head that I want to run through before I say things. Because I run through that checklist anyway, I don't feel like I lost any autonomy [with PREVIEW automatically doing those checks for me]. So, it fits very nicely into my life\". P6 highlighted that many autistic individuals may already experience heightened levels of overthinking before sending a message, and introducing the option to manually toggle PREVIEW Ccould exacerbate this tendency and users would be \"bound to overthink more\". In P6's and P8's opinion, automatic PREVIEW could prevent folks from unnecessarily tog-gling PREVIEW, as it would automatically activate if an issue was detected. However, P6 acknowledged that manually toggling PRE-VIEW \"reduces a bit of anxiety because you don't have to hit the send button and then wait for an evaluation, alleviating a lot of pressure since all the revision work happens before you press send\". Similarly, P7 compared the feeling of constant scrutiny and anxiety resulting from automatic PREVIEW to the sword of Damocles in phase 1 of the study 4. However, participants noted in phase 2 that manually toggling PREVIEW could also result in positive feedback. P7 and P8 felt \"acknowledged\" and \"cared for\" when PREVIEW described some of their messages as \"understanding\", \"affirmative\" and \"conscien-tious\". Additionally, P2, P3 and P8 saw the value of being able to manually toggle PREVIEW in certain circumstances. P2 expressed, \"if I'm texting my dad, I probably wouldn't use it. However, when I am texting someone I'm not particularly close to, or having a dif-ficult conversation with a friend, I'd likely use it to ensure that I'm conveying my message as intended\".\nMisaligned Feedback. Occasionally, participants indicated that although PREVIEW's judgement was accurate, it was exactly what they wanted to convey, and were unconvinced that they should not send their message. For instance, the following feedback was provided by PREVIEW to P2 when they expressed to Ben a clear preference for not inviting other people to the movies because coordinating with large groups was a hassle: \"Your message might be perceived as dismissive by Ben, as it is highlighting a dislike for dealing with large groups.\" P2 swiftly responded, \"but conveying that is exactly the point of my message\". Similarly, P3 expressed at one instance, \"I am definitely acting unenthusiastic or uninterested [the words unenthusiastic and uninterested were part of the feedback provided by PREVIEW], which is my goal with this response\". P1, P3 and P6 echoed these sentiments. Moreover,```json\n[5] P2 pointed out that a message that appears blunt or insulting might be perfectly normal in conversations with a friend that they are accustomed to talking like that. They feared PREVIEW's accuracy \"could be hit or miss depending on the specific dynamics of the interaction\" if it is not able to adapt to those dynamics. Overall, participants valued the option to ignore the feedback if they wanted and continue to send their original message, and disagreed with the following statement: \"The application's ability to automatically prevent an inappropriately toned message from being sent negatively impacts user autonomy\" (avg. = 2.25, s.d. = 1.98)."}, {"title": "5.2.3 Reactions to SUGGEST", "content": "Self-expression in the Suggested Alternatives. Alternate messages produced by SUGGEST were perceived by participants as softer and more thoughtful, and included justifications with strong opinions or decisions to make them appear less imposing. For instance, when SUGGEST changed the message \"coordinating with others is a has-sle\" to \"organising with a lot of people might complicate our plans, don't you think?\", P3 commented, \"the word 'hassle' is definitely replaceable. The addition of 'don't you think' makes it less confronta-tional, because it is like we are working together. It is a more tactful way to express the same sentiment\". Similarly, in phase 1, SUGGEST changed \"Just as long as we don't go to a seafood restaurant\" to \"Just a heads up, I'm not really a seafood fan!\", and P6 expressed, \"I [in my original message] come across as if I am imposing a rule, implying that seafood should be completely off the table, whereas the suggestion sounds gentler and more like offering a consideration\". P2, P4, P5 and P7 expressed similar opinions.\nIn certain instances, however, especially in scenarios of disagree-ment, participants expressed SUGGEST appeared to undermine their opinions by softening their original message so much that it reduced the intensity and emotional depth more than required. For instance, when SUGGEST changed the message \"umm... is that [inviting oth-ers to the birthday party] necessary?\" to \"what do you think? Should we keep it small or invite everyone?\", P4 stated, \"It [the alternative provided by SUGGEST] does not express the fact that I have a preference [for a small group]. If I took all of the suggestions, without editing any of them, I feel I would have a very passive tone and not be able to give my input. The rephrasing introduces flexibility but at the expense of omitting my preference for a smaller group. I think I'm more likely to be unhappy if I don't ever express my own preferences \". P1, P3, P7 and P8 echoed these sentiments, highlighting SUGGEST hindered their ability to clearly express their preferences. Participants valued the option to ignore the suggestion if they wanted and continue to send their original message, disagreeing (avg. = 2.25, s.d. = 1.98) with the statement, \"The application's ability to generate and suggest alternative messages negatively impacts user autonomy.\"\nNeed for Personalization. At many instances, participants felt the suggested alternative messages did not have a human-like writing style, were not personalized to match their own, and used words that did not resonate with the dynamics of the rest of the conver-sation. For example, when SUGGEST changed the message \"i don't think we need to [invite others]\" to \"I guess it could be more in-timate if it's just us\", P1 commented \"I think it's kind of overdoing it because it's not necessarily supposed to be intimate, right? I think the word choice is kind of bad in this one\". P4 expressed the alter-nate messages were often \"Al-ish and pretty generic...\" and P3 found one of the suggestions to be \"a little wordy\". Overall, participants disagreed (avg. = 3, s.d. = 1.93) with the statement, \"It felt as if the message suggestions generated by the application's suggest feature had been written by me.\" As a result, participants resorted to a num-ber of strategies for utilizing the alternate message in some way instead of using it to replace their original message. For instance, P4 adjusted the alternative suggestion to more closely mirror their own style by matching the word construction to their typical usage, but found it beneficial that the suggested message contained the right content, which they could use without having to come up with it themselves. P3, P4, and P6 chose to selectively integrate phrases from the suggested alternate message into their original message, instead of using the suggested alternative in its entirety. P3 noted that just reading the alternate message also helped them understand what aspects of their original message could be improved."}, {"title": "5.3 Suggestions for Improvement", "content": "Establishing Trust in INTERPRET. P4 emphasized the importance of establishing appropriate trust levels in INTERPRET, cautioning against over-reliance, \"I don't want myself to think that this can do more than it really can... Now I may over trust it and now we have a problem because I'm going to trust it when I shouldn't trust it\". They suggested incorporating a visual 'certainty measure' to inform users about INTERPRET'S confidence in the interpretations it made. P4 argued this would be particularly valuable in scenarios involving nuanced elements like slang or inside jokes that could confuse the system itself. In their opinoin, this would help users build a balanced level of trust, encouraging them to also rely on their instincts, \"this might be really valuable in building the right amount of trust so that people know to trust their own instincts too\" and consider the possibility of errors in INTERPRET'S judgment, \"having a certainty measure will also cue people to think about the fact that the computer could be wrong\". In addition, P1 and P8 expressed the need to be able to see for senders what was being shown to recipients. P1 expressed, \"it would allow me to see, 'Oh yeah, that's about right', and provide the opportunity to correct it if not\".\nExpanding PREVIEW. While participants liked the concept of PRE-VIEW, they believed it could be expanded upon. In P2's opinion, \"it's not just about how the recipient takes your message, but more importantly, it's about ensuring that what you're sending accurately reflects what you intend to say\". They suggested that, alongside recipient reactions, it would be useful to be able to preview a mes-sage's tone and meaning, as this would guarantee that the message conveyed precisely what the sender intended. For P1, who struggled with maintaining their weight in conversations, it was a perfect use-case for PREVIEW to nudge the user to contribute more to the conversation when needed, in addition to nudging them when a message came across as blunt, \"the app could prompt me to think about how I can continue the conversation...\". Moreover, P4 argued that PREVIEW should be capable of identifying messages that are not inherently rude but may become rude if done repeatedly. They stated, \"It's challenging when actions don't follow a strict rule, and only become rude with repetition. For example, PREIVEW could di-rect me to suggest another genre to Ben, which would make for an even better message than asking Ben to pick another genre, especially since I've already said no [to the genre he suggested] like three times\". Additionally, P5 proposed it would be useful to have PREVIEW trig-gered for instances where their message came across as sarcastic to \"catch instances where you are trying not to sound sarcastic\" as \"this definitely happened before\" with them. P7 and P8 noted that their inclination towards \"lateral thinking\" and \"jumping between topics\" sometimes led to others struggling to grasp the connection between their messages. They suggested PREVIEW could proactively nudge users to stay focused on the topic at hand in such instances.\nTailoring PREVIEW for Diverse Age Groups. As a parent of autistic kids, P4 envisioned utilizing PREVIEW to teach their children written communication skills. They contended that children of different age levels might require varying levels of explanations, \"I think about how I talk to my 5-year-old autistic kid versus my 15-year-old [real age not disclosed to preserve anonymity] autistic kid, and how I explain things. People with different levels of experience will need different levels of instruction. So, if you have someone who has a lot of meta-cognitive, purpose-built social skills, or someone who doesn't have many of those skills, they might need different levels of explicit explanation. That might be something valuable to customize [with a slider]\". In their opinion, more detailed feedback could entail precisely specifying the dependency between certain words/phrases and the recipient's reaction, \"I would definitely need to explain to the 5-year-old why someone might perceive a message as blunt or dismissive or whatever. For example, my feedback could include 'the message \"horror is for kids\" can be problematic because they [the receiver] don't want to be seen as a child, especially if they're an adult'. The extra explanation would be obnoxious to somebody who has already learnt that\". P1 echoed with these suggestions.\nPersonalizing Suggestions. P2, P3, P4, and P8 stressed the im-portance of tailoring the suggested alternate messages to fit their individual writing styles, preferences, and interests. P4 suggested a simple strategy to enhance personalization, proposing that, in addition to offering new message suggestions, SUGGEST should also provide specific guidance on ways to improve the existing message. They saw this feature as a natural extension of SUGGEST seamlessly integrating with PREVIEW. They elaborated, \"it could provide in-sights like: You might be perceived as dismissive and judgmental of Ben's preferences - A better message could be 'I am not really into horror films', and then suggesting a genre that you do like.\". In their opinion, this could make room for personalization without the AI having to access their personal data, \"how does the computer know what one likes without being connected to their data, which a lot of people might not be excited about?\". In addition, P8 suggested having a calibration process \"[for the application to] understand me a little bit more\" by \"figuring out what my tone normally is\"."}, {"title": "6 DISCUSSION", "content": "In this section, we delve into the design and practical implications of our study, explore future directions, and discuss our limitations."}, {"title": "6.1 Balancing Personalization and Privacy", "content": "Participants highlighted the need for improved personalization by adjusting flagging sensitivity, tailoring feedback to users' abilities, and matching suggestions to their writing styles, alongside con-cerns that personalization might require extensive collection of user data. It is important to note that different levels of personal-ization require varying degrees of user data. Adapting to a user's writing style in a certain conversation involves analyzing how they communicate within that conversation [52]. Conversely, providing highly personalized message suggestions based on specific inter-ests requires the system to know about users beyond the content of a single conversation [53]. Hence, it is crucial to ask a) with access to 'just enough information' about users, can we achieve the required level of personalization, and b) what constitutes 'just enough information'. In the context of SUGGEST, one strategy is to provide 'guidance' or 'advice' rather than suggesting alternative messages as replacements. This allows users to personalize their message as well as receive help on how to write and what kind of content to include (or not), without needing to reveal personal data beyond the immediate context of the conversation. Another option could be to iteratively obtain user feedback and regenerate the suggestions accordingly. Personalization is crucial, yet our findings also indicate that giving users too much to manage-such as overly frequent underlining of phrases can be overwhelming. Therefore, a key aspect of inculcating personalization into systems lies in offer-ing users control over customizable knobs without over-burdening them [54]."}, {"title": "6.2 Toward Trustworthy User Interfaces", "content": "Recall that participants were hesitant to trust the system too much, knowing it may not always be correct. They feared that using the system for longer periods could lead them to rely on it even in instances where it was wrong. In the context of providing social support, particularly through subjective interpretations and judg-ments, being strictly right or wrong is challenging as the connection between writing style and intent can be unclear depending on con-text and individual differences [55]. Our findings underscore the importance of clearly and transparently communicating this uncer-tainty to the user, which is inherent to judgements of this nature, particularly when AI is making the judgments. Effectively utilizing user interfaces might be one way to address this [56]. Visual indi-cators of the Al's confidence in its output, or using language that suggests possibility ('could', 'might') rather than certainty ('will', 'must'), can remind users that the AI may not always be correct and encourage them to trust their own instincts. In addition, incor-porating adaptive learning in TwIPS by tailoring its assistance to individual user needs could promote independence and decrease users' reliance on it over time. As users gain experience, they might need less assistance, while new users might need more."}, {"title": "6.3 Beyond Neurodivergent Users", "content": "Drawing inspiration from the double empathy problem [23], we advocate for measures that encourage neurotypical individuals to also contribute to improving communication. P4 and P7 expressed a strong desire for such measures too. For P4, it would be \"interesting to see an app that goes the other way around - rewriting messages for neurotypicals to incorporate direct language.\" P7 echoed these sentiments, expressing, \"They [neurotypical individuals] sort of need to meet me halfway!\" Such an approach could involve deploying a version of the TwIPS prototype on both ends of chatting appli-cations for all users, whether they identified as neurodivergent or not. An autistic user could receive help from this prototype with interpreting nuanced language and emojis. The same prototype could help a neurotypical user understand the unique writing style of their autistic peer, explaining that a brief reply does not nec-essarily signal disinterest. This could also extend to interactions among neurotypical users, considering emotional expression and interpretation in text messages, although not to the same degree as autistic users, is challenging for a large proportion of all users [57, 58]. In this way, the prototype could provide feedback to any user based on the specific communication challenges they face and the writing style of the person they are interacting with. Realizing this vision would require accessibility researchers to engage with neurotypical individuals, exploring their perceptions and interac-tions with neurodivergent individuals, and evaluate prototypes collectively with all users involved. [59]. Given communication is fundamentally collaborative, it would be interesting for researchers to explore how double empathy can serve as a design framework to extend this approach to other modes of digital communication."}, {"title": "6.4 Combining AI-based Simulations with Real-world Interactions", "content": "TwIPS acted as both a learning tool and a safeguard. For exam-ple, participants expressed PREVIEW not only helped them develop a mental model of how their words might be perceived as rude, dismissive, or offensive by others (like a learning tool), but also pre-vented them from coming across as such (like a safeguard). AI-aided simulations together with AI-assistance - similar to participants' interaction with Ben's AI-persona in phase 2 - can provide an en-vironment to learn, and real-time AI-assistance during real-world interactions can serve as a safeguard. However, combining AI-aided simulations with real-world interactions could create a more long-lasting, personalized and dynamic tool. Different Al-personas could allow autistic individuals to engage with different kinds of conver-sational partners and scenarios in a controlled environment, akin to past AR-based simulations that exposed users to different physi-cal environments or social stories [60]. Conversely, assistance in real-world interactions could help users mitigate challenges in situ-ations involving complex and varied stakes, and enhance learning in real-world settings which may differ from simulations. Together, the simulations and real-world interactions form a symbiotic re-lationship, where real-world interactions help inform the design of specific simulation strategies while simulations inform the level of assistance needed and what to focus on during real-world in-teractions. It would be useful for future researchers to explore how to best leverage this symbiotic relationship within a single, autonomous system."}, {"title": "6.5 Practical Implications and Lessons Learnt", "content": "Participants' reactions to our prototype suggest that TwIPS could add value to texting platforms, dating applications, and social media sites that support text-based communication. Popular platforms like Meta's WhatsApp already support generative AI-based bots for open-ended QnA [61] and possess the technical infrastructure needed for widespread AI-adoption. This existing infrastructure, combined with the fact that TwIPS was designed with the layout of standard chatting applications in mind, makes them well-suited for incorporating TwIPS' features. However, any integration would need to be done in a privacy-preserving manner [62]. While there are benefits to deploying it on scale ourselves, such as control over functionality and design, and the opportunity to conduct longi-tudinal user studies with more participants, practical constraints such as cost pose a significant feasibility challenge for academic researchers. Cost to run the LLM was a major contributor to our expenses, which varies with the length of the input and output of each LLM call as well as model quality, which depends on model size [63] and training data quality [64]. We fed the complete conver-sation history to GPT4 with each call, causing the input length to increase substantially. Employing a cheaper model [65] or retrieval augmented generation techniques [66] to extract relevant portions of history could shorten the input length and thus lower cost. In addition, we observed that one LLM does not need to perform all tasks. Given the variety of models available with different costs and quality, strategically allocating advanced, expensive models for complex tasks, and choosing affordable, less sophisticated models for other use-cases can significantly reduce cost. In the context of TwIPS, a complex task might involve using PREVIEW for a conversa-tion with a potential date as opposed to a casual chat with a friend, or utilizing INTERPRET for explaining a hyper-local phrase unique to a conversation rather than a well-known idiom."}, {"title": "6.6 Limitations", "content": "There are a number of limitations of our study. Recruiting partici-pants solely from a university setting restricts the generalizability of our findings to the broader autistic community, due to a lack of di-versity in age, background, and education. While the data from our participant pool showed repeated themes, expanding it to include a more diverse demographic might uncover additional themes. In both phases of the user study, participants engaged with an imagi-nary character. Participants may have made varying assumptions about their relationship dynamics with Ben, leading to differences in their interactions and responses. While keeping the complexity of this setup minimal, we made maximum effort to provide all es-sential details of the setup to participants. Lastly, the in-lab setting of our study may not fully replicate the nuances and dynamics of real-life texting, which typically involves more complex and varied stakes. A longer-term deployment and evaluation of TwIPS in the wild, paired with a control group comparison, could yield a more confident assessment."}, {"title": "7 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we presented the design and evaluation of TwIPS, a prototype texting application powered by a large language model to simplify conversational nuances for autistic users. We evaluated our prototype with 8 autistic participants in an in-lab setting. Our find-ings revealed that TwIPS enabled a convenient way for participants to seek clarifications, provided a better alternative to tone indica-tors, and facilitated constructive reflection on writing technique and style. We also examined how autistic users utilize language for self-expression and interpretation in instant messaging, and gathered feedback for enhancing our prototype. We concluded with a discussion around balancing user trust and autonomy with AI-assistance, users' customization needs in the context of AI-assisted communication, and designing interventions that distribute respon-sibility for reducing communication breakdowns more equitably across all users, instead of placing it solely on autistic users."}]}

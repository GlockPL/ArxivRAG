Noninvasive techniques can be effectively utilized through various medical imaging\nmodalities. Key noninvasive imaging technologies include Positron Emission Tomography\n(PET), Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, Single Photon Emission Computed\nTomography (SPECT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and X-ray. Among these, MRI is\nknown to deliver superior results compared to computed tomography in the realm of medical\ndiagnostics. It enhances the contrast between different soft tissues in the human body, thereby\nimproving diagnostic accuracy[1].\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Brain Tumor Association\n(ABTA), the most widely accepted classification scheme for brain tumors uses a grading system\nthat ranges from grade I to grade IV. This system effectively distinguishes between different\ntypes of benign growths and malignant tumors[2].\nBrain tumors are classified into two main types: benign (non-cancerous) and malignant\n(cancerous). Malignant tumors have the potential to spread rapidly to other tissues within the\nbrain, which can significantly worsen the patient's condition[3]. Normally, old or damaged cells\nare replaced by new, healthy cells. However, if these damaged or aged cells are not eliminated\nduring the generation of new cells, it can lead to complications. This excess production of cells\noften results in the formation of a mass of tissue, commonly referred to as a tumor. Detecting\nbrain tumors is particularly challenging due to factors such as the size, shape, location, and type\nof tumor. Early diagnosis of brain tumors is often difficult, as accurate measurements of tumor\nsize and resolution are not easily attainable[4]."}, {"title": null, "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for diagnosing\nvarious types of brain cancers. Unlike traditional X-rays, MRI scans utilize powerful magnetic\nfields and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. As noted by researchers Josefina\nPerlo, Christoph M\u00fclder, Ernesto Danieli, Christian Hopmann, Bernhard Bl\u00fcmich, and Federico\nCasanova, MRI produces visual \"slices\" of the brain that can be compiled to create a three-\ndimensional representation of tumors[5].\nTo enhance the clarity of these scans, contrast agents may be employed. An MRI scan operates\nby using specific components of its intense magnetic field to generate radio frequency pulses,\nresulting in comprehensive images of organs, soft tissues, bones, and other internal structures of\nthe human body[6, 7].\nThis technique is invaluable for providing extensive information regarding the architecture of\nbrain tumors, enabling accurate diagnosis, effective treatment planning, and monitoring of\ndisease progression. Advances in MRI technology have refined the ability to measure changes\nwithin and around primary and metastatic brain tumors, including edema, volumetric alterations,\nand distinct anatomical features. furthermore, MRI can produce computerized representations of\ntissue characteristics across various planes, thereby facilitating the comprehensive detection and\nassessment of brain masses. Collectively, these capabilities underscore MRI's critical role in the\nclinical evaluation of brain tumors[6, 7].\nWith the advances in machine learning and computational techniques in recent years, the\npotential and the need of developing computerized methods to assist radiologists in image\nanalysis and diagnosis has been recognized as an important area of research and development in\nmedical imaging[8]\nThe rapid advancement and adoption of big data and AI technologies have revolutionized\nproblem-solving processes by enabling real-time, data-driven predictions of various diseases,\ncomprehensive evaluations of treatment options, and the automated execution of complex tasks\non a large scale[9].\nDeep learning methods excel particularly well when trained on substantial datasets.

In 2D CNN\nmethods, a 3D volume is partitioned into multiple 2D slices, and brain tumors are predicted\nindependently for each slice[18, 20]. For example, Caver et al. employed three separate 2D\nUNets to segment whole tumors (WT), tumor cores (TC), and enhancing tumors (ET) in a slice-\nby-slice manner [21]. Similarly, Choudhury et al. trained three multi-class segmentation models\non axial, coronal, and sagittal slices, utilizing majority voting to generate final predictions [22].\nMcKinley et al. introduced a novel DeepSCAN architecture that integrates a pooling-free\nDenseNet within a UNet framework, applying their model across three planes and using majority\nvoting for final predictions. This multi-view fusion technique of 2D CNN results has also been\nwidely applied to other tasks, referred to as 2.5D CNN[23, 24].\nAdditionally, other types of deep learning networks have been explored for brain tumor\nsegmentation, including generative adversarial networks (GAN), transformers, and capsule\nneural networks. For instance, Nema et al. developed a network architecture called the residual\ncyclic unpaired GAN (RescueNet), which incorporates residual and mirroring principles[25].\nWang et al. integrated a transformer into a 3D CNN for brain tumor segmentation, proposing a\nnovel network known as TransBTS, built on an encoder-decoder structure [26].

The proposed\nsegmentation pipeline involved three UNet architectures with varying inputs to enhance\nsegmentation performance. The first UNet utilized 3D patches from multi-modal MR images,\nwhile the second integrated brain parcellation as an additional input. The third UNet combined\n2D slices of multi-modal MR images with brain parcellation and probability maps for WT, TC,\nand ET generated by the second UNet. This sequential process united WT segmentation from the\nthird UNet with the fused TC and ET segmentations from the first and second UNets,\nconstituting the complete tumor segmentation. A post-processing strategy was implemented to\ncorrect false-positive ET segmentations by labeling small ET areas as non-enhancing tumors[29].\nJaspin and Suganthi [30]conducted a study on brain tumor segmentation and morphological edge\ndetection in MR images, employing regional growth (RG) techniques. Their performance\nevaluation utilized the fuzzy C-means (FCM) approach. The study integrated three\nmethodologies: RG, region of interest (ROI), and morphological operations. The proposed\nsolution included preprocessing to eliminate noise, area growth based on FCM, and edge\ndetection via morphological operations to enhance the images. Following these morphological\nprocesses, which included erosion and dilation on the tissue samples, the FCM technique was\nsubsequently used for tumor segmentation.\nSingh et al. [31]introduced an innovative method for brain tumor detection that utilized a fully\nconnected pyramid pooling network (FCPPN) for tumor segmentation. This approach aimed to\naccurately identify the location and type of tumor for classification. The classification was\nperformed using a multi-tier convolutional neural network with channel preference\n(MTCNNCP).

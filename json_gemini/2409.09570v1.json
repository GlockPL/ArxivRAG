MindScape explores a novel approach to AI-powered journaling by integrating passively collected behavioral patterns such as conversational engagement, sleep, and location with Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration creates a highly personalized and context-aware journaling experience, enhancing self-awareness and well-being by embedding behavioral intelligence into AI. We present an 8-week exploratory study with 20 college students, demonstrating the MindScape app's efficacy in enhancing positive affect (7%), reducing negative affect (11%), loneliness (6%), and anxiety and depression, with a significant week-over-week decrease in PHQ-4 scores (-0.25 coefficient). The study highlights the advantages of contextual AI journaling, with participants particularly appreciating the tailored prompts and insights provided by the MindScape app. Our analysis also includes a comparison of responses to Al-driven contextual versus generic prompts, participant feedback insights, and proposed strategies for leveraging contextual Al journaling to improve well-being on college campuses. By showcasing the potential of contextual AI journaling to support mental health, we provide a foundation for further investigation into the effects of contextual AI journaling on mental health and well-being.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The significance of struggles with mental health among college students is becoming increasingly apparent, impacting students' academic performance, social engagement, and overall personal development. Research, including findings from the American College Health Association (ACHA)-National College Health Assessment, highlights a concerning prevalence of anxiety, depression, and related issues among students [4, 7, 53, 55]. Students face a range of pressures, from academic challenges to social and personal hurdles, which affect not only their mental health but also their emotional resilience and personal growth [33, 71, 74, 75]. While traditional mental health interventions administered by clinicians do provide personalized and context-specific support, emerging technologies present an opportunity to extend this support, making it more readily available, automated, and able to potentially overcome considerable institutional barriers. In addition, there is a need for innovative solutions that align with the digital habits of today's students. We propose a novel study, MindScape, that integrates the traditional practice of journal writing with mobile technology and large language models (LLM) [54] to create a contextually-aware journaling application. The MindScape Android application benefits from on-device sensors and data to provide insights into the user's daily life. It tracks aspects such as physical activity, social interactions, and location to form an understanding of the context in which the individual operates. By analyzing these data in real-time, the app can provide personalized, context-sensitive journaling prompts designed to provoke thought and reflection. The prompts aim to remind users to introspect and commit time to digitally record their thoughts, thus establishing regular self-reflection habits that are contextualized by their daily lives. MindScape represents a novel application class that incorporates behavioral intelligence into AI. We believe that integrating time-series data obtained from mobile phones and wearables, capturing real-time behaviors and patterns of users, with the capabilities of LLMs will give rise to a new category of AI applications driven by mobile sensing.\nJournaling has long been recognized as a potent tool for self-reflection, enabling individuals to externalize thoughts, consolidate disjointed experiences, and identify patterns in their behavior and emotional states. This practice of regular introspection has been linked to a range of psychological benefits, from reducing distress symptoms to enhancing"}, {"title": "", "content": "overall wellbeing [26, 70]. In this study, we explore the potential gains realized through the inclusion of personalization and context-awareness in journaling. We define 'context' as the comprehensive set of behavioral, environmental, and temporal factors shaping a user's daily experience and mental state. For the purpose of our study, this includes physical activities, sleep patterns, social interactions, digital behaviors, and location data, considering both current and historical patterns. The inclusion of personalization and context-awareness in journaling is more than just a technological novelty. It addresses certain inherent limitations in human introspection and memory recall abilities. People may not readily identify certain behavioral patterns or come to particular conclusions about their daily lives without some form of guidance or external input. This is where personalized and context-aware prompts can be valuable, as they may highlight aspects of users' lives they may have overlooked. Additionally, human memory recall can be biased towards more recent experiences (recency bias) and peak emotional experiences (peak-recency bias), sometimes at the expense of equally significant past events [22, 44, 65]. Context-aware journaling can help counteract this limitation by bringing forward relevant circumstances, events, or feelings from different timeframes in the users' life. Lastly, by addressing these user limitations, personalized and context-aware journaling could not just improve the process of journaling, but also potentially enhance the mental health benefits associated with this practice.\nHerein lies the novelty of our approach: using mobile sensing to capture behavioral data that reflects the user's context and emotional state, and employing an LLM to generate journaling prompts that are highly relevant to the user's current contextual situation and surroundings. To complement our context-aware journaling prompts, we introduce daily check-ins as a novel feature in our study app. These brief, simple texts are triggered four times daily and aim to encourage users to pause and reflect on their current experiences. For instance, a check-in might say, \"Your morning seemed to include more than just tapping screens a bit of chitchat too!\". Users can respond with a quick thumbs up or thumbs down, allowing for a low-burden, high-engagement interaction. By leveraging contextual intelligence, our check-ins aim to increase user attachment and engagement with the journaling app, while also making their reflections more meaningful and potentially amplifying the mental health benefits of journaling. The primary goal of these check-ins is to facilitate fleeting moments of self-reflection, helping users develop greater awareness of their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors throughout the day. By incorporating thumbs up/down responses, we simplify the reflection process, making it more accessible and increasing the likelihood of users engaging in regular self-reflection. Furthermore, the MindScape journaling app integrates additional contextual factors such as students' mood while journaling, their academic stress levels, and temporal variables like weekdays or weekends. While previous studies have explored various aspects of digital journaling and context-aware applications, MindScape uniquely combines several elements: (a) it integrates a wide range of passive sensing data specifically for mental health journaling, going beyond simple activity or location tracking; (b) it employs LLMs to generate personalized, context-aware journaling prompts, a novel application in the mental health domain; (c) it introduces frequent, low-burden check-ins to complement deeper journaling sessions, encouraging continuous self-reflection throughout the day; and (d) it focuses on the specific needs and contexts of college students, a population particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges. By addressing these gaps, our study aims to push the boundaries of how technology can support mental health in young adults.\nWe explore whether a more comprehensive, context-aware, and AI-driven approach to journaling can lead to deeper self-reflection and significant improvements in well-being. Early in our development, we conduct a qualitative user study with undergraduate students to understand their journaling habits and preferences. Insights from this study, revealing students' desires for personalized, context-aware prompts aimed at fostering reflection on daily experiences, significantly influenced our app's design. We believe our holistic approach allows for a more tailored and responsive"}, {"title": "", "content": "tool, capable of providing meaningful support in the unique, often high-pressure, fast paced environment of college life. Our paper makes the following contributions:\n(1) We design MindScape an Al-driven journaling app that integrates behavioral sensing and LLM to deliver personalized, adaptive journaling prompts. We conduct an 8-week study with 20 college students to evaluate the efficacy of this system. By the end of the study, participants report up to an 11% improvement in well-being scores, with statistically significant enhancements in affect, loneliness, mindfulness, self-reflection, anxiety, and depression.\n(2) We examine the check-ins and journaling prompts generated by the app, analyzing their topic coverage, and the frequencies of categories to which the prompts belong. We find that the morning check-ins often revolve around social and communication app usage, while afternoon check-ins shift towards academic and social life experiences.\n(3) We analyze linguistic differences between journals from contextual and generic prompts using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [11]. Our findings indicate that responses to contextual prompts exhibit more personal language, greater references to personal experiences and relationships, whereas broader emotional expressions (such as affect) are more prevalent in journals from generic prompts.\n(4) We review participant feedback concerning their experience and the app's usability and provide recommendations for future research. Overall, 85% of participants rate MindScape's usability as good or excellent. Seventy percent consider the journal prompts to be moderately-to-very relevant, and 85% report that the contextual prompts sometimes, often, or always lead to more in-depth reflection compared to generic prompts, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MindScape app.\nIt is important to note that our objective is to introduce and evaluate a new journaling paradigm that integrates behavioral sensing and contextual awareness. This research conducts a proof-of-concept study on contextual journaling, specifically focusing on its effectiveness as a unique journaling method. We do not perform controlled trials to determine which approach is more beneficial. Ours is an exploratory study designed to potentially augment the classic benefits of journaling by utilizing the latest advancements in LLMs to provide an unobtrusive, effective tool for users to manage their wellbeing and growth. This approach is closely aligned with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community's interests, highlighting the significance of Al in enriching user-centric digital experiences. Bridging into Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp), our research focuses on integrating these technologies into everyday routines. Our goal is for this tool to offer benefits and support and assist students in developing lasting self-reflection and emotional mindfulness skills. We hope that this study will contribute significantly to the ongoing dialogue in HCI and UbiComp, particularly regarding the seamless integration of technology to enhance personal well-being, offering a comprehensive view of its practical application and user impact."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Journaling is a reflective practice where individuals record their thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

We conduct interviews with students to illuminate their needs and experiences with journaling, providing a foundational understanding for our research approach. The stages of the study are detailed in Figure 1. As we transition into the Development and Testing phase, we refine our methodology and initiate participant recruitment. We employ various channels such as posters, class-wide emails, Computer Science majors and minors email chains, student mailing lists, and collaborations with mental health-related campus clubs to reach potential participants. Out of 91 respondents expressing interest, 26 qualify for the study (the majority of them have Apple phones while our app only supports Android), with 20 ultimately signing the consent form to participate.\nDuring the recruitment and onboarding process, we prioritize transparency regarding data collection and usage. Participants are provided with comprehensive information about the types of data collected, the methods and frequency"}, {"title": "", "content": "of collection, and how this data will be used within the app. This information is presented in detail on our recruitment form and reiterated verbally during individual onboarding sessions. During these sessions, participants have the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification on any aspect of the data collection process. We emphasize that participation is voluntary and that users can withdraw at any time without consequence. We also take care to exclude individuals with high depression scores, as indicated by elevated Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ8) survey results, to ensure safety due to the unmoderated nature of the reflection prompts. Once enrolled, participants install the MindScape Android app on their phones and enable the permissions for the signals. We clearly communicate during the onboarding process that while the app is designed to function optimally with full data access, users have the right to manage their privacy settings through their device's permission controls. Users are informed that they can adjust permissions at the system level, and the app will adapt accordingly, ensuring they maintain control over their data sharing while participating in the study.\nThe central six weeks of our study involve participants interacting with contextual AI-driven journal prompts delivered through the app. This begins with an onboarding process, where participants complete a baseline survey that captures their initial journaling habits, demographic details, and psychological states via standard surveys focused on well-being and self-reflection. At the conclusion of this six-week contextual journaling phase, we administer a follow-up survey using the same standard questionnaires. This enables us to gauge changes in well-being, personal growth, and reflection, assessing whether AI-driven contextual journaling contributes positively to participants' development. Additionally, we conduct weekly Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) \u2013 a research methodology that involves repeatedly collecting self-reported data from participants to capture dynamic changes and patterns over time \u2013 to monitor changes in participants' well-being and reflection. Please see Appendix A for the list of surveys and questions we ask participants.\nFollowing the initial contextual journaling phase, the participants enter a two-week period of generic journaling, receiving a uniform prompt via the MindScape app: \"What's on your mind today? Use this journal entry to explore freely any thoughts, feelings, memories, or experiences\u2014anything you'd like.\u201d Due to a limited sample size, a full randomized controlled trial was not feasible. Nevertheless, this phase provides an opportunity to compare and contrast traditional journaling with our AI-driven contextual method. After completing the full eight-week study duration, participants receive the final study feedback survey, which collects their insights on their journaling experience. This includes thoughts on the app's usability and performance as well as any additional feedback or suggestions. Participants are compensated up to USD 130 for their involvement.

This provides an integrated view of a user's daily patterns, social interactions, and digital habits. For example, the sensing data might reveal patterns in how often participants attend social functions, dine at campus facilities, or go to the gym. This information allows us to tailor the journaling prompts to align with the participant's current experiences and to support their emotional well-being. As part of gathering this data, we create a semantic map of the college campus, with locations such as dining areas and gyms marked, allowing the app to accurately infer the context of participants' activities. This allows for prompts to be customized, encouraging reflection on particular events of the day. The integration of the GPT-4 LLM enables the translation of this rich, multi-faceted behavioral data into personalized and contextually relevant journaling prompts and frequent check-ins that enhance positive introspection and participant engagement. All data collected are temporarily stored on the participant's phone and then securely uploaded to the MindScape cloud. We then leverage the GPT-4 model through OpenAI's API [58], allowing us to process the collected behavioral data and additional contexts to generate tailored prompts. Addressing potential concerns relating to participant privacy, we ensure all data sent for processing via OpenAI's GPT-4 model are de-identified and consist only of high-level metadata. This approach includes stripping any potentially personally identifiable information before the data is utilized to generate tailored prompts. We acknowledge that a locally hosted open-source model could offer an alternative to mitigate privacy concerns further, albeit with possible performance trade offs. In this study, our focus is oriented towards understanding the potential and efficacy of this novel application of AI in journaling practices. Given this emphasis, we decided to utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 model for its robust performance and scalability capabilities."}, {"title": "3.4 Personalized Journaling Prompts", "content": "Upon installing MindScape app, participants are prompted to allow the app permission for data collection.

Because we collect many different types of data, we want to ensure the journaling prompts we provide are actually helpful to participants. Thus, we use these categories to identify what matters most to each individual participant.

The MindScape app offers such check-ins four times a day at 12.30 PM, 3.30 PM, 6.30 PM and 11 PM. These times are strategically selected to suit the daily rhythms of college students, ensuring the interaction remains brief and unobtrusive.\nEach check-in is designed to incorporate the behavioral data gathered during the time period extending from the previous check-in up to the current one. For instance, the 3:30 PM check-in uses data collected from 12:00 PM to 3:30 PM, while the 6:30 PM check-in uses data gathered from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. This approach ensures that each check-in is responsive to the most recent behavioral data captured for the participant. The goal of these check-ins is to both increase the visibility of the app (as opposed to users seeing it just once a day for journaling) as well as to increase reflection on behavior through a casual, quick touchpoints. Please refer to Appendix B for the complete GPT-4 prompt we use to generate check-ins.

After this period, the subsequent two weeks featured generic, static prompts that consistently asked, \"What's on your mind today? Use this journal entry to explore freely any thoughts, feelings, memories, or experiences \u2013 anything you'd like.\u201d We now compare participants' responses to these generic prompts with those to the contextual prompts using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC).

By analyzing the frequency of psychologically meaningful words, LIWC allows us to understand aspects such as emotionality, social relationships, and thinking styles in the journal entries. For clarity, we refer to entries from contextual and generic prompts as \"contextual journals\u201d and \u201cgeneric journals\u201d.\nThe LIWC analysis in Table 2 reveals nuanced differences in how participants engage with contextual and generic journaling prompts. Notably, generic prompts elicit slightly longer responses (Mean = 44.51, SD = 15.78) compared to contextual prompts (Mean = 43.67, SD = 17.62). This difference in response length may be related to the thinking style encouraged by each prompt type. Generic prompts yield higher analytic thinking scores (Mean = 40.50, SD = 21.72), indicating a more formal and logical thinking style. In contrast, contextual prompts result in lower analytic thinking scores (Mean = 33.39, SD = 27.34), suggesting a more personal and spontaneous writing approach. This difference in thinking styles is also reflected in the Clout scores, which reveal a disparity in the level of confidence and expertise conveyed through language. Contextual journal entries express less confidence and authority (Mean = 10.78, SD = 13.23) compared to generic journals (Mean = 9.43, SD = 9.53), resulting in a more tentative and exploratory writing tone. Furthermore, the two prompt types also differ in terms of authenticity, emotional tone, and cognitive processes. Contextual journals score lower in authenticity (Mean = 83.78, SD = 18.76) compared to generic journals (Mean = 85.11, SD = 20.94), but show similar emotional tone scores (contextual Mean = 67.49, SD = 28.45; generic Mean = 68.09, SD = 25.41). But, generic prompts prompted a noticeably higher affective content (Mean = 8.17, SD = 3.80) compared to contextual prompts (Mean = 5.84, SD = 4.36), suggesting that generic prompts may encourage broader emotional expressions. In addition, generic journals have a higher positive tone (e.g., good, well, new, love) and reduced negative tone (e.g., bad, wrong, too much, hate) as well. However, contextual journals have higher cognition scores (Mean = 14.69, SD = 7.26) than generic journals (Mean = 11.41, SD = 6.44), indicating a greater emphasis on thinking, problem-solving, and memory recall. Moreover, the language used in contextual journals reveals a greater focus on personal experiences and relationships, with more pronouns used (Mean = 18.14, SD = 5.95) compared to generic journals (Mean = 14.66, SD = 5.02). This is consistent with the finding that contextual prompts encourage more social references (Mean = 3.34, SD"}, {"title": "", "content": "= 3.75) than generic journals (Mean = 1.87, SD = 2.09), indicating a strong focus on social bonds and community. Finally, generic prompts encourage a broader temporal focus (Mean = 7.38, SD = 4.41) compared to contextual prompts (Mean = 5.63, SD = 4.25), particularly in the higher scores for past and future focus. This suggests that generic prompts may encourage participants to link their current experiences with past memories or future aspirations more frequently than contextual prompts. Note that due to the differing time periods associated with each type of journaling, we normalized the scores to ensure comparability. To do this, we first calculated the LIWC scores per week for each participant during the 6-week contextual prompts period and the 2-week generic prompts period, separately. Then, we averaged each set of scores separately to obtain a final weekly average for both journaling experiences."}, {"title": "4.4 Exploring Changes in Wellbeing and Emotional Growth", "content": "In this section, we evaluate the changes in the participants' well-being and personal growth following the contextual journaling phase.

These surveys are designed to assess changes in their behavior and well-being.\nChanges in Baseline vs. Follow-up Survey: We administer the same set of standard surveys to participants at the beginning of the study and at the six-week follow-up, when the contextual journaling phase ends and generic journaling begins. We compare the responses and detail the mean differences on Table 3, which includes the baseline mean (start of the study), mean at follow-up (at the six-week mark), the mean change in value, mean change expressed as a percentage, the effect size (Cohen's d), and the 95% confidence interval (C.I.) of the effect size. We also conduct a paired t-test, shading non-statistically significant values in grey. It is essential to note that, while we report statistical significance in adherence to standard result reporting practices, considering outcomes regardless of statistical significance is valuable given our small sample size. This limitation often leads to fewer statistically significant results. Therefore, we also report effect sizes, which reveal notable effects despite a lack of significance. Given the exploratory nature of our study, dismissing potential relationships solely based on statistical significance is not advisable. Moreover, the wide confidence intervals for all values-attributable to the small sample size-present intriguing results that warrant further investigation with a larger sample in future studies.\nWe observe several positive outcomes from the study. Interestingly, we find a significant decrease of 11.81% in the personality trait neuroticism, which is typically associated with negative emotions, with a medium effect size (p-value 0.001, effect size (d) = -0.63). We consider effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 as small, medium, and large, respectively, regardless of the sign, which merely indicates the direction of change. Although changes in agreeableness are not statistically significant, we observe a modest increase of 3.03% with a small effect size. Changes in other personality traits do not reach statistical significance, and their effect sizes remain small. Given that personality is generally stable, significant alterations in traits like neuroticism and agreeableness within a short timeframe are noteworthy. We do not observe any significant changes in emotion regulation, neither through statistical significance nor through effect sizes. However, we note promising indicators of improved well-being at the follow-up, including an increase in positive affect and a decrease in negative affect. Specifically, positive affect, which reflects the extent to which individuals experience positive moods such as joy, interest, and alertness, increases by 7.15% (p-value = 0.05, d = 0.39). Conversely, negative affect, which encompasses a range of negative emotional states including anxiety, depression, stress, and sadness, decreases by 10.60% (p-value = 0.05, d = -0.62). Both changes are statistically significant and exhibit moderate to large effect sizes.\nWe observe notable changes in various psychological metrics. Stress and anxiety decrease by 11.18% and 8.00%, respectively, although these reductions are not statistically significant and exhibit small effect sizes.

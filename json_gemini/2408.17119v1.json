Introduction", "content": "Imagine having an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) that responds to commands and performs tasks across various apps or services without requiring users to navigate complicated interfaces or juggle multiple logins on smartphones or computers (Medium, 2024). This is the concept introduced by Rabbit R1, a newly developed portable IPA (PIPA) designed to revolutionize user interaction and control (Sullivan, 2024). Rabbit R1 aims to simplify traditional app-based interfaces by offering a single, unified interface for various tasks, such as controlling music, ordering services, and facilitating communication (The Verge, 2024). Its intuitive voice controls,\ncombined with a dedicated training mode and adaptive learning capabilities, enable it to learn and execute tasks autonomously (Medium, 2024).\nThe recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) software have led to the development of devices like Rabbit R1. The PIPA operates on a unique AI technology known as the large action model (LAM) (Sullivan, 2024). LAM extends beyond the generative outputs of large language models (LLMs) to include control over device applications (Zulhusni, 2024). The model's training involved numerous recorded user sessions with various apps, and its development was further enhanced through a partnership with the LLM- powered chatbot Perplexity AI, ensuring more precise and up-to-date responses to user inquiries (Cadenas, 2024). Rabbit R1 has garnered significant attention since its launch in January 2024, with its presentation receiving 11 million views at launch alone. The device sold out (10,000 units) in 24 hours, generating USD 10 million, and received 50,000 pre-orders within two weeks after its release (Brenner, 2024; Zulhusni, 2024).\nDespite this enthusiasm, there is limited understanding of the factors motivating users' acceptance of PIPAs like Rabbit R1. Current research primarily focuses on digital IPAs such as Apple Siri (Brill et al., 2022), Amazon Alexa (Liao et al., 2019; McLean & Osei-Frimpong, 2019), and ChatGPT (Camilleri, 2024; Mvondo et al., 2024), leaving a crucial gap in our understanding of PIPAs. Unlike their digital counterparts, PIPAs combine AI capabilities with tangible hardware (Zulhusni, 2024), introducing unique dimensions of user interaction not addressed by research on digital assistants. This combination of physical form, portability, and AI functionality in PIPAS presents new challenges and opportunities for user engagement. Understanding the adoption factors for PIPAs is vital, as it will inform the design and development of more user-centric features, ensuring these devices meet user needs and preferences.\nThis research leverages the technology acceptance model (TAM) to explain user acceptance of Rabbit R1. TAM is a prominent model in information systems research that aims to explain people's intentions to adopt technology (Davis, 1989). The model posits that \"perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are key determinants of an individual's intention to use technology\" (Niu & Mvondo, 2024, p. 3). TAM is widely employed due to its generic nature (e.g., Atti\u00e9 & Meyer-Waarden, 2022; Okine et al., 2023; Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2024; T\u00fcrker et al., 2022). However, this ubiquity is also its primary limitation (Lew et al., 2020), as the model is inadequately equipped to fully explain portable AI companions like Rabbit R1. Hence, this study\nextends the model by incorporating critical aspects of AI and user interface design: perceived intelligence and simplicity.\nPerceived intelligence refers to the extent to which users believe an AI system demonstrates cognitive capabilities, such as performing tasks efficiently, engaging in coherent and meaningful conversations, and exhibiting human-like qualities in its behavior and responses (Ling et al., 2023). It is an essential attribute of any AI system (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024), influencing how users evaluate and engage with technology (Guha et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021; Priya & Sharma, 2023). Despite extensive research, the theoretical understanding of perceived intelligence remains unclear (Zhao et al., 2024). Much of the existing research has adopted a single-dimensional approach, neglecting the complexity of its various aspects and their impact on user acceptance and loyalty to IPAs (e.g., Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Moussawi et al., 2020). The few studies that have employed a multidimensional approach have mainly examined booking and exploration intentions (Ling et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024) and did not explore how these aspects influence user acceptance and loyalty. Recent research suggests the need for a better understanding of the characteristics of perceived intelligence (Zhao et al., 2024). This understanding will allow for the identification of key aspects that are important to users and help companies develop products and services that specifically respond to users' needs and expectations.\nPerceived simplicity is a critical element in user interface design, referring to features that facilitate the perception and processing of digital devices (Choi & Lee, 2012; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). This concept encompasses facets such as information design and visual simplicity (Choi & Lee, 2012). Simplicity is essential for creating aesthetically pleasing and efficient interfaces, leading to positive evaluations of technological products (Choi & Lee, 2012). Despite its significance, it has not yet been explored in the context of IPAs. Additionally, its potential impact on user acceptance and loyalty remains underexplored in the literature. Examining its impact on user acceptance and loyalty to IPAs can offer valuable insights for designing more appealing and intuitive devices, ultimately enhancing user experience and driving long-term engagement.\nThis research aims to address the identified gaps in the literature on IPAs. It seeks to answer the question:\nRQ1: What key factors influence user acceptance of PIPAs like Rabbit R1?\nRQ2: How does user acceptance drive loyalty?\nWe develop an extended TAM model that integrates perceived intelligence and simplicity factors, along with user loyalty. To test our model, the study utilizes a sample of 821 users and employs advanced analytical methods such as partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA).\nThe originality and contributions of this research are as follows. Theoretically, as a pioneering study examining user acceptance of PIPAs like Rabbit R1, this study contributes to the literature on IPAs and human-computer interaction (HCI). It reveals the positive influence of PU, PEOU, perceived intelligence factors, and simplicity factors on user acceptance, which translates into user loyalty. Notably, fsQCA analyses support the PLS-SEM findings and identify configurations leading to high and low user acceptance. From a managerial perspective, this research provides valuable insights for system designers and marketers of PIPAs, guiding strategic decisions to foster widespread adoption and long-term engagement."}, {"title": "2. Literature review on IPAS", "content": "Sun (2021) defined an IPA as a software agent or device that provides services and solutions to users. Users can interact with IPAs either through text (text-based personal agents) or voice commands (voice-based personal agents) (Canbek & Mutlu, 2016). While most IPAs are virtual (e.g., ChatGPT and Apple Siri), some take the form of physical robots, such as Samsung Ballie, or portable devices, exemplified by Rabbit R1.\nScholars have increasingly focused on understanding the determinants of user adoption of IPAs. They have examined different types of assistants, such as virtual companions, digital pets, virtual health counselors, and chatbots integrated into various applications (Ling et al., 2021). These agents were explored in various contexts, ranging from general assistance to companionship, social support, communication, customer service, education, and healthcare (e.g., Badghish et al., 2024; Bhutoria, 2022; Kim et al., 2021; Kautish et al., 2023; Santiago et al., 2024; Song et al., 2022). Most of these studies have used TAM (Davis, 1989) and its variations, including TAM2 and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT and UTAUT2), as theoretical foundations (e.g., Aw et al., 2022; Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Vimalkumar et al., 2021). Other studies have used theories such as the uses and gratifications theory (U&G), the computers as social actors (CASA) paradigm, and the consumer acceptance of technology model (CAT-Model) (Kopplin, 2022; Xie et al., 2024).\nThe predictors of IPA adoption can be categorized into four main areas: usage-related factors, agent-related factors, user-related factors, and attitude and evaluation factors. Factors in the usage- related category involve how the technology is deployed and how users perceive its performance in specific contexts (Ling et al., 2021). This is the most prominent category, with many factors derived from TAM and UTAUT (e.g., Kang et al., 2024; Kautish et al., 2023; Sun, 2021). In the agent-related category, research mainly focuses on factors related to the social behavior of IPAs, with elements such as anthropomorphism and social presence receiving significant attention (Ling et al., 2021; Priya & Sharma, 2023). Research on user-related factors examines demographics such as age, gender, household size, and various psychological factors reflecting users' emotional states (e.g., Kaya et al., 2024; Priya & Sharma, 2023). For instance, McLean and Osei-Frimpong (2019) revealed that age, gender, and technology familiarity did not influence the use of IPAs. However, they observed that household size positively influenced acceptance. Finally, regarding the attitude and evaluation category, research has employed factors related to user attitudes and emotional reactions toward IPAs (Ling et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "2.1. Perceived intelligence", "content": "Intelligence is an important characteristic of any AI-powered device (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi,\n2024; Ling et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024). Intelligent systems have played a significant role in information systems since the 1950s (Moussawi et al., 2021). These systems were initially created to solve complex problems humans cannot solve. With the rapid advancement in AI, systems capable of answering questions in natural languages and exhibiting social skills have emerged (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Moussawi et al., 2021). Perception of intelligence in a system \u201cdenotes a combination of intelligent quotient and capabilities\u201d (p. 4). It is how well a system can understand and process natural language input to provide relevant and useful information efficiently (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Ling et al., 2023). Moussawi et al. (2021) explain that a system is perceived as intelligent when \u201cit understands user requests, responds without continuous user intervention, exhibits awareness of the physical and virtual worlds, adapts to change, learns from acquired information and user behavior, and completes tasks within a favorable timeframe\u201d (p. 5).\nScholars have explored the perceived intelligence of IPAs from various perspectives. Moussawi et al. (2021) discovered that perceived intelligence affects anthropomorphism, PEOU,\nand PU. Similarly, Balakrishnan and Dwivedi (2024) found that it influenced user attitude and purchase intention. Priya and Sharma (2023) identified a positive relationship between perceived intelligence and utilitarian attitude, while Guha et al. (2023) revealed that it leads to a positive evaluation of IPAs. However, these studies have generally treated perceived intelligence as a unidimensional construct and did not validate its role in driving user acceptance and loyalty to IPAs. Moreover, the scales used in these studies do not adequately capture the unique characteristics of IPAs (Zhao et al., 2024), whose perception of intelligence largely depends on the textual characteristics of the dialogue, the ability to perform tasks autonomously, and human-like traits (Ling et al., 2023). Moussawi and Koufaris (2021) argued that treating perceived intelligence as a single-dimensional construct lacks sufficient depth in accurately measuring it. They advocated for a comprehensive approach that captures all aspects of intelligent systems. Thus, this research conceptualizes perceived intelligence as a construct with three dimensions specifically reflecting the unique characteristics of PIPAs: conversational intelligence, task intelligence, and perceived naturalness.\nConversational intelligence is the ability of IPAs to comprehend and process users' natural language inputs smoothly and intuitively (Ling et al., 2023). This capability is achieved through \u201cnatural language understanding/processing, machine learning, conversation context recognition, and memory\u201d (Ling et al., 2023). Conversationally intelligent systems enhance user interactions by interpreting user queries, predicting user needs, and providing relevant and timely responses (Guha et al., 2023; Ling et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021). By leveraging these technologies, conversationally intelligent systems aim to make interactions feel natural and proactive, ensuring that users can communicate with the device as effortlessly as they would with another person.\nTask intelligence refers to the ability of IPAs to understand specific objectives or requests issued by users and execute associated tasks or commands proficiently, effectively, and in a contextually relevant manner (Moussawi & Koufaris, 2019; Zhao et al., 2024). This involves understanding the user's instructions and integrating contextual awareness to ensure the tasks are carried out accurately and appropriately (Guha et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021). Task intelligence enables PIPAs to perform tasks and implement actions with minimal user intervention, such as controlling apps or devices, searching for information, and providing reminders or alerts (Hu et al., 2021a; Moussawi et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "2.2. Perceived simplicity", "content": "Simplicity is an essential element of user interface design and HCI, reflecting the different facets that facilitate the perception and processing of a system (Choi & Lee, 2012; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). It is the main component of beauty and is valued positively because it inherently provides pleasure to users, making their interactions with technology more enjoyable (Choi & Lee, 2012). It is intrinsic in nature, meaning that an object can be perceived as simple without extensive cognitive effort or detailed reasoning about its utility. Choi et al. (2012) explained that perceived simplicity is understood through its different facets, including simplicity in information design and visual aesthetics.\nSimplicity in information design pertains to the optimal structuring of an interface (Choi & Lee, 2012). It involves designing a system so that only essential steps are required to complete a\ntask (Choi & Lee, 2012; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). This approach focuses on organizing, structuring, and presenting information clearly, efficiently, and effectively, creating a layout and visual hierarchy that helps users find, understand, and interact with information easily. Choi and Lee (2012) state that \u201cinterfaces that do not adhere to the principle of simplicity often include unnecessary and complicated steps in task execution.\u201d Consequently, users may experience increased difficulty navigating such devices, leading to heightened frustration (Verkijika & De Wet, 2019).\nVisual aesthetics generally pertain to a digital interface or device's overall visual appeal and attractiveness (Choi & Lee, 2012). It refers to the degree to which users perceive a system's design or appearance as aesthetically appealing. An aesthetically pleasing design can engage users, making their interaction with the device more enjoyable and satisfying (Luo et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). Visual simplicity is subjective and can vary among users (Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). However, to ensure that most users find an interface visually appealing, it is crucial to prioritize \u201cunity in diversity\u201d in interface design (Choi et al., 2012).\nPerceived simplicity is an under-researched construct in HCI literature. Scant research has examined its impact on user acceptance and loyalty with technology. To the best of the authors' knowledge, research has yet to examine the construct in the context of IPAs. This may be because the extant literature has primarily focused on digital IPAs."}, {"title": "3. Theoretical foundation", "content": "3.1. TAM\nTAM, developed by Davis (1989), is a framework designed to explain and predict user acceptance and adoption of technology. PU and PEOU are central constructs in TAM, as they determine user intention to adopt a technology. PU refers to \u201cthe subjective belief that a particular technology enhances one's performance or productivity,\" while PEOU reflects \u201cthe degree to which users perceive using a particular technology to be free of effort\u201d (Davis, 1989). TAM has been widely employed in various contexts due to its simplicity and robustness, providing valuable insights into how user perceptions influence their acceptance and use of new technologies (Atti\u00e9 & Meyer-Waarden, 2022; Okine et al., 2023; Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2024). In the context of IPAs, several studies have extended TAM with contextual factors (e.g., Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024;\nNiu & Mvondo, 2024). For instance, Balakrishnan and Dwivedi (2024) extended TAM with factors such as perceived intelligence, animacy, and anthropomorphism, finding that the model could explain 33.3% and 38.9% of the variance in purchase intention and attitude toward IPAs. Likewise, Maduku et al. (2023) extended the model with privacy concern, localization, passion, commitment, and Word-of-mouth (WOM), finding that the model could explain 77.1%, 61.1%, and 96.3% of the variance in passion, WOM, and commitment, respectively."}, {"title": "4. Hypotheses development and research framework", "content": "4.1. PU and PEOU\nPU and PEOU are key determinants of an individual's acceptance of technologies (Okine et al., 2023; Rodriguez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2024; T\u00fcrker et al., 2022), such as the Rabbit R1. Moussawi et al. (2021) explain that IPA characteristics, such as task completion and personalization, can influence users to perceive the device as useful. When users believe that Rabbit R1 can effectively streamline their activities\u2014such as controlling various device applications, managing music, ordering services, and facilitating communication (The Verge, 2024)\u2014they are more likely to acknowledge its value and be willing to integrate it into their daily lives. Additionally, if the device is designed with an interface that is user-friendly and requires a minimal learning curve (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Moussawi et al., 2021), users are more inclined to adopt it, as the simplicity reduces potential frustrations and cognitive load. Several scholars have established the relationship between PU, PEOU, and user intention to adopt IPAs (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Choi & Kim, 2023; Sohn & Kwon, 2020). In line with their findings, we propose the following hypotheses:\nH1. PU is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\nH2. PEOU is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.2. Perceived intelligence\n4.2.1. Conversational intelligence\nAs explained earlier, conversational intelligence is \u201cthe degree to which IPAs can comprehend users' natural language inputs and smoothly conduct conversations in a proactive and timely manner\u201d (Ling et al., 2023, p. 5). While the extant literature has yet to establish the impact of conversational intelligence on PU and user acceptance of IPAs, Ling et al. (2023) argue that it is a critical element that can significantly influence the overall user interaction experience. When PIPAs like Rabbit R1 accurately understand and respond to users' spoken commands, interactions become more intuitive and efficient. Smooth, intuitive, and proactive conversations make users more likely to find the PIPA useful and valuable (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Priya & Sharma, 2023), leading to higher acceptance. This natural and responsive interaction fosters trust and reliability (Moussawi et al., 2021), influencing users to integrate the PIPA into their daily routines. Based on this reasoning, we hypothesize that:\nH3a. Conversational intelligence is positively related to PU.\nH3b. Conversational intelligence is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.2.2. Task intelligence\nTask intelligence refers to the ability of IPAs to understand specific objectives or requests issued by users and execute associated tasks or commands proficiently, effectively, and in a contextually relevant manner (Moussawi & Koufaris, 2019; Zhao et al., 2024). While existing studies have not directly examined the impact of task intelligence on PU and IPA acceptance, we argue that when Rabbit R1 can effectively and accurately conduct tasks across various device applications, it can significantly influence users' perceptions of usefulness and their willingness to integrate the PIPA into their daily routines. This proficiency can reduce the user's effort and time to complete these tasks manually (Guha et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021a), making the device a valuable tool for simplifying daily routines. However, if the PIPA struggles with task execution, it may lead to a perception of uselessness and hinder adoption. Several scholars have argued that the utility of IPAs can be higher because they can be used for various tasks (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Hu et al., 2021a). The ability to conduct tasks can influence user intention to adopt the AI companion (Moussawi et al., 2021). Based on this reasoning, we hypothesize that:\nH4a. Task intelligence is positively related to PU.\nH4b. Task intelligence is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.2.3. Perceived naturalness\nCompanies often design IPAs with natural human voices (Hu et al., 2021b; Kang et al., 2024; Priya & Sharma, 2023; Zhao et al., 2024). When PIPAs like Rabbit R1 utilize natural-sounding speech, users are more likely to perceive the AI companions as human-like. Features such as appropriate pauses, intonation, and conversational flow make the speech sound more authentic, reducing the cognitive effort required to understand and engage with the assistant (Guha et al., 2023; Humphry & Chesher, 2021). This naturalness of speech can foster a sense of familiarity and trust, making interactions more pleasant and less robotic (Hu et al., 2021b; Kang et al., 2024), thereby improving the overall experience with PIPAs. The extant literature has yet to establish the impact of perceived naturalness on IPA acceptance. However, Guha et al. (2023) explain that natural-sounding speech may lead users to conclude that they are talking to a human, which can influence user attitudes toward AI devices. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:\nH5. Perceived naturalness is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.3. Perceived simplicity\n4.3.1. Simplicity in information design\nSimplicity in information design is crucial for the success of a system (Choi et al., 2012). When a PIPA interface adheres to the principle of simplicity by eliminating unnecessary and complicated steps, it reduces cognitive load and potential frustration (Choi et al., 2012; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). This straightforward interaction experience enhances users' perception of the device as user-friendly. As users find it simpler to accomplish their tasks, it can lead to positive experiences (Sharma et al., 2015; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019), making them more likely to adopt and integrate the AI companion into their daily routines. However, if the device is designed to be complex or includes unnecessary steps, users may find it difficult to navigate (Choi et al., 2012), hindering their acceptance. Consequently, simplicity in information design is crucial for ensuring that a large number of users adopt the device. Research has yet to thoroughly examine the impact of simplicity in information design on PEOU and IPA acceptance. However, Choi et al. (2012)\nfound that simplicity in design can lead to user satisfaction. Moreover, Sullivan (2024) explained that Rabbit R1 features a simple and minimalistic interface design, which may influence users' perception of user-friendliness and their acceptance of the device. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\nH6a. Simplicity in information design is positively related to PEOU.\nH6b. Simplicity in information design is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.3.2. Simplicity in visual aesthetics\nThis research argues that the simplicity in visual aesthetics can influence user acceptance. This is because a simple visual design can convey a sense of modernity and sophistication, making the device more attractive to users. Additionally, a product with an aesthetically well-designed interface is better valued (Luo et al., 2024; Pang et al., 2024; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). By fostering a pleasant and straightforward user experience, simplicity in visual aesthetics can increase trust and willingness to adopt and regularly use Rabbit R1, thus promoting overall acceptance. Previous research has consistently shown that visual aesthetics positively influence users' intentions (B\u00f6len, 2020; Kumar et al., 2021). Accordingly, we advance that:\nH7. Visual aesthetics is positively related to PIPA acceptance.\n4.4. User loyalty\nJones and Sasser (1995) described loyalty as \u201ca feeling of attachment or affection for a company's people, products, or services\u201d (p. 94). It involves consistently choosing one company's products and services over those of competitors (Chen et al., 2023; Maroufkhani et al., 2022). Loyal customers are less influenced by price or availability and are often willing to pay more to maintain the quality and familiarity they value. Loyalty is vital for a product's success and is reflected through ongoing usage and positive WOM (Niu & Mvondo, 2024). Continuance usage involves a user's repeated engagement and preference for the product, indicating a high level of satisfaction and value derived from it (Cui et al., 2022; Niu & Mvondo, 2024; Sohaib & Han, 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Likewise, positive WOM occurs when satisfied customers share their favorable experiences, endorsing the product and influencing potential buyers (Niu & Mvondo, 2024; Sohaib & Han, 2023). It is a unique method of spreading information based on personal recommendations\nrather than advertising or promotional efforts. This combination reinforces the customer's allegiance and helps to attract new customers, contributing to the product's success and the company's reputation.\nThis research argues that user acceptance of Rabbit R1 can lead to loyalty. When users find the PIPA effective and satisfying due to its utility, ease of use, intelligence, and simplicity in user interface design and visual aesthetics, they are more likely to integrate the device into their daily routines, resulting in consistent and long-term usage. Furthermore, a positive user experience enhances trust and satisfaction (Cui et al., 2022; Niu & Mvondo, 2024; Sohaib & Han, 2023; Zou et al., 2023), prompting users to recommend the device to others. The connection between user acceptance and loyalty has been examined in previous research. Alkhwaldi et al. (2022) revealed that users who adopt technological products or services often become loyal users. In line with this finding, we predict that user acceptance of PIPAs will lead to loyalty and mediate the relationships between the proposed factors and loyalty.\nH8. PIPA acceptance is positively related to user loyalty.\nH9-H15. PIPA acceptance positively mediates the association between the predictor variables (PU, PEOU, conversational intelligence, task intelligence, perceived naturalness, information design, and visual aesthetics) and user loyalty (Fig.1)."}, {"title": "5. Methodology", "content": "5.1.Measures\nWe referred to the existing literature to develop the research instrument and items, making minor adjustments for contextual relevance. A 7-point Likert-type scale was used to measure the items, ranging from \u201c1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\u201d The measurement items and their sources are detailed in Table 1.\n5.2. Pilot Study\nWe first carried out a small-scale pilot study with three primary objectives: evaluating the validity of the measurement scales, (2) enhancing the quality of the questions, and (3) refining and adjusting the survey. The pilot study involved 90 respondents (37 females). Based on respondents' feedback, exploratory factor analysis, and reliability analysis, we made further revisions and finalized the questionnaire, removing factors with loadings lower than 0.5.\n5.3. Data collection and sampling\nData were collected from US residents in June 2024 using a structured online questionnaire administered through MTurk, employing a purposive sampling method. We specifically collected data in the US because Rabbit R1 was first made available there. To ensure the quality of our data and address threats posed by self-misrepresentation, inconsistent English language fluency, and MTurker non-naivete, we undertook several measures following guidelines outlined by Aguinis et al. (2021). First, we designed a concise questionnaire and avoided scales with labeled \u2018end' points to enhance the quality of the data. Second, to address inconsistent English language fluency, we determined a priori that only respondents from the US, a native English-speaking country, would be considered. Third, to address MTurker non-naivety, inattention, and vulnerability to web robots, we incorporated an attention check question. This open-ended question asked respondents what the study was about (Aguinis et al., 2021). Lastly, respondents who passed the attention check and took between four to ten minutes to complete the survey were retained, aligning with screening practices to detect careless responses.\nThis meticulous process resulted in 824 valid responses, with 489 males (59.3%) and 335 females (40.7%). Among the respondents, 43.8% identified as White, and 26.9% as Black or African American. The majority were aged 18-40 years. Additionally, 41.1% held a bachelor's degree, with most respondents being students (33.4%), followed by employees (32.2%) and businesspeople (24.9%) (see Table 2).\n5.4. Analytical method\nThis research employed a synergistic approach, combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA for data analysis. This strategy has gained increasing popularity among management scientists aiming to address the inherent limitations of each method (Acquah et al., 2024; Kang et al., 2024; Mvondo & Niu, 2024; Navarro-Garc\u00eda et al., 2024), thereby enhancing the robustness of the research findings. PLS-SEM was chosen for several reasons: it is suitable for constructing and validating exploratory theoretical models. Since our study is exploratory and seeks to identify the drivers of PIPA acceptance through theoretical integration, using PLS-SEM is highly appropriate. Additionally, it has strong statistical power for hypothesis testing (Rasoolimanesh et al., 2021). Unlike conventional covariance-based methods, PLS-SEM uses bootstrapping techniques to ensure parameter stability and significance. Finally, as Hair et al. (2019) explain, PLS-SEM is particularly suitable when \u201cthe structural model is complex and includes many constructs, indicators, and/or model relationships\" (p. 4). Given our model's complexity with seven independent variables, PLS-SEM is deemed appropriate.\nHowever, PLS-SEM is limited in that it cannot identify the critical combinations of factors that lead to high or low acceptance. In contrast, fsQCA excels in identifying these combinations\n(Fiss, 2011). fsQCA stands out due to its ability to handle intricate relationships among multiple predictors and outcome variables (Pappas et al., 2016). Unlike traditional symmetric analyses like regression and correlation, fsQCA considers multiple factors and their combinations, providing a nuanced understanding of causality through fuzzy set theory and Boolean algebra (Ragin, 2009). This approach addresses limitations often encountered in correlation-based methods, such as overfitting, and offers a more comprehensive view of complex relationships. Rasoolimanesh et al. (2021) suggest that combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA can offer deeper insights for theory and practice. Thus, we combined these two methods to examine the drivers and configuration paths of user acceptance of PIPAs. This approach will offer more effective managerial recommendations by considering various combinations of causal factors in specific organizational contexts.\nThe data analysis unfolded in three stages: (1) assessing model reliability and validity, (2) testing hypothesized relationships, and (3) conducting fsQCA. We employed SmartPLS version 4.1 for common method bias (CMB) and PLS-SEM, while for fsQCA, we utilized version 4.1."}, {"title": "6. Results", "content": "6.1. Common method bias\nWe employed a multistep approach to address CMB. Initially, we assured respondents of the study's strict anonymity protocol, emphasizing that their survey responses were intended to reflect their genuine experiences with Rabbit R1. This approach aimed to ensure unbiased responses free from external influences. Secondly, we conducted Harman's single-factor test, which indicated that a single factor explained only 9.599% of the total variance, well below the commonly accepted threshold of 50%. Lastly, following Kock's (2015) recommendation, we conducted a comprehensive collinearity test and confirmed that all variance inflation factors were below the threshold of 3.3. Therefore, we confidently assert that CMB did not significantly affect our study.\n6.2. Measurement model\nWe assessed our measurement model's reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity. The findings indicated that the latent variables exhibited strong reliability, with factor loadings ranging from 0.856 to 0.762, Cronbach's alpha values between 0.877 and 0.780, and composite reliability (CR) consistently exceeding 0.7. Furthermore, the constructs' average variance extracted (AVE)\nranged from 0.663 to 0.55"}]}

Introduction", "content": "Imagine having an intelligent personal assistant (IPA) that responds to commands and performs tasks across various apps or services without requiring users to navigate complicated interfaces or juggle multiple logins on smartphones or computers (Medium, 2024). This is the concept introduced by Rabbit R1, a newly developed portable IPA (PIPA) designed to revolutionize user interaction and control (Sullivan, 2024). Rabbit R1 aims to simplify traditional app-based interfaces by offering a single, unified interface for various tasks, such as controlling music, ordering services, and facilitating communication (The Verge, 2024). Its intuitive voice controls,\ncombined with a dedicated training mode and adaptive learning capabilities, enable it to learn and execute tasks autonomously (Medium, 2024).\nThe recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) software have led to the development of devices like Rabbit R1. The PIPA operates on a unique AI technology known as the large action model (LAM) (Sullivan, 2024). LAM extends beyond the generative outputs of large language models (LLMs) to include control over device applications (Zulhusni, 2024). The model's training involved numerous recorded user sessions with various apps, and its development was further enhanced through a partnership with the LLM- powered chatbot Perplexity AI, ensuring more precise and up-to-date responses to user inquiries (Cadenas, 2024). Rabbit R1 has garnered significant attention since its launch in January 2024, with its presentation receiving 11 million views at launch alone. The device sold out (10,000 units) in 24 hours, generating USD 10 million, and received 50,000 pre-orders within two weeks after its release (Brenner, 2024; Zulhusni, 2024).\nDespite this enthusiasm, there is limited understanding of the factors motivating users' acceptance of PIPAs like Rabbit R1. Current research primarily focuses on digital IPAs such as Apple Siri (Brill et al., 2022), Amazon Alexa (Liao et al., 2019; McLean & Osei-Frimpong, 2019), and ChatGPT (Camilleri, 2024; Mvondo et al., 2024), leaving a crucial gap in our understanding of PIPAs. Unlike their digital counterparts, PIPAs combine AI capabilities with tangible hardware (Zulhusni, 2024), introducing unique dimensions of user interaction not addressed by research on digital assistants. This combination of physical form, portability, and AI functionality in PIPAS presents new challenges and opportunities for user engagement. Understanding the adoption factors for PIPAs is vital, as it will inform the design and development of more user-centric features, ensuring these devices meet user needs and preferences.\nThis research leverages the technology acceptance model (TAM) to explain user acceptance of Rabbit R1. TAM is a prominent model in information systems research that aims to explain people's intentions to adopt technology (Davis, 1989). The model posits that \"perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) are key determinants of an individual's intention to use technology\" (Niu & Mvondo, 2024, p. 3). TAM is widely employed due to its generic nature (e.g., Atti\u00e9 & Meyer-Waarden, 2022; Okine et al., 2023; Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2024; T\u00fcrker et al., 2022). However, this ubiquity is also its primary limitation (Lew et al., 2020), as the model is inadequately equipped to fully explain portable AI companions like Rabbit R1. Hence, this study"}, {"title": "extends the model by incorporating critical aspects of AI and user interface design: perceived intelligence and simplicity.", "content": "Perceived intelligence refers to the extent to which users believe an AI system demonstrates cognitive capabilities, such as performing tasks efficiently, engaging in coherent and meaningful conversations, and exhibiting human-like qualities in its behavior and responses (Ling et al., 2023). It is an essential attribute of any AI system (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024), influencing how users evaluate and engage with technology (Guha et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021; Priya & Sharma, 2023). Despite extensive research, the theoretical understanding of perceived intelligence remains unclear (Zhao et al., 2024). Much of the existing research has adopted a single-dimensional approach, neglecting the complexity of its various aspects and their impact on user acceptance and loyalty to IPAs (e.g., Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Moussawi et al., 2020). The few studies that have employed a multidimensional approach have mainly examined booking and exploration intentions (Ling et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024) and did not explore how these aspects influence user acceptance and loyalty. Recent research suggests the need for a better understanding of the characteristics of perceived intelligence (Zhao et al., 2024). This understanding will allow for the identification of key aspects that are important to users and help companies develop products and services that specifically respond to users' needs and expectations.\nPerceived simplicity is a critical element in user interface design, referring to features that facilitate the perception and processing of digital devices (Choi & Lee, 2012; Verkijika & De Wet, 2019). This concept encompasses facets such as information design and visual simplicity (Choi & Lee, 2012). Simplicity is essential for creating aesthetically pleasing and efficient interfaces, leading to positive evaluations of technological products (Choi & Lee, 2012). Despite its significance, it has not yet been explored in the context of IPAs. Additionally, its potential impact on user acceptance and loyalty remains underexplored in the literature. Examining its impact on user acceptance and loyalty to IPAs can offer valuable insights for designing more appealing and intuitive devices, ultimately enhancing user experience and driving long-term engagement.\nThis research aims to address the identified gaps in the literature on IPAs. It seeks to answer the question:\nRQ1: What key factors influence user acceptance of PIPAs like Rabbit R1?\nRQ2: How does user acceptance drive loyalty?"}, {"title": "We develop an extended TAM model that integrates perceived intelligence and simplicity\nfactors, along with user loyalty.

Notably, fsQCA analyses support the PLS-SEM findings and identify configurations leading to high and low user acceptance. From a managerial perspective, this research provides valuable insights for system designers and marketers of PIPAs, guiding strategic decisions to foster widespread adoption and long-term engagement."}, {"title": "2. Literature review on IPAS", "content": "Sun (2021) defined an IPA as a software agent or device that provides services and solutions to users. Users can interact with IPAs either through text (text-based personal agents) or voice commands (voice-based personal agents) (Canbek & Mutlu, 2016). While most IPAs are virtual (e.g., ChatGPT and Apple Siri), some take the form of physical robots, such as Samsung Ballie, or portable devices, exemplified by Rabbit R1.\nScholars have increasingly focused on understanding the determinants of user adoption of IPAs. They have examined different types of assistants, such as virtual companions, digital pets, virtual health counselors, and chatbots integrated into various applications (Ling et al., 2021). These agents were explored in various contexts, ranging from general assistance to companionship, social support, communication, customer service, education, and healthcare (e.g., Badghish et al., 2024; Bhutoria, 2022; Kim et al., 2021; Kautish et al., 2023; Santiago et al., 2024; Song et al., 2022). Most of these studies have used TAM (Davis, 1989) and its variations, including TAM2 and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT and UTAUT2), as theoretical foundations (e.g., Aw et al., 2022; Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Vimalkumar et al., 2021). Other studies have used theories such as the uses and gratifications theory (U&G), the computers as social actors (CASA) paradigm, and the consumer acceptance of technology model (CAT-Model) (Kopplin, 2022; Xie et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "The predictors of IPA adoption can be categorized into four main areas: usage-related factors,\nagent-related factors, user-related factors, and attitude and evaluation factors. Factors in the usage-\nrelated category involve how the technology is deployed and how users perceive its performance\nin specific contexts (Ling et al., 2021). This is the most prominent category, with many factors\nderived from TAM and UTAUT (e.g., Kang et al., 2024; Kautish et al., 2023; Sun, 2021). In the\nagent-related category, research mainly focuses on factors related to the social behavior of IPAs,\nwith elements such as anthropomorphism and social presence receiving significant attention (Ling\net al., 2021; Priya & Sharma, 2023). Research on user-related factors examines demographics such\nas age, gender, household size, and various psychological factors reflecting users' emotional states\n(e.g., Kaya et al., 2024; Priya & Sharma, 2023). For instance, McLean and Osei-Frimpong (2019)\nrevealed that age, gender, and technology familiarity did not influence the use of IPAs. However,\nthey observed that household size positively influenced acceptance. Finally, regarding the attitude\nand evaluation category, research has employed factors related to user attitudes and emotional\nreactions toward IPAs (Ling et al., 2021).", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1. Perceived intelligence", "content": "Intelligence is an important characteristic of any AI-powered device (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Ling et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024). Intelligent systems have played a significant role in information systems since the 1950s (Moussawi et al., 2021). These systems were initially created to solve complex problems humans cannot solve. With the rapid advancement in AI, systems capable of answering questions in natural languages and exhibiting social skills have emerged (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Moussawi et al., 2021). Perception of intelligence in a system \u201cdenotes a combination of intelligent quotient and capabilities\u201d (p. 4). It is how well a system can understand and process natural language input to provide relevant and useful information efficiently (Balakrishnan & Dwivedi, 2024; Ling et al., 2023). Moussawi et al. (2021) explain that a system is perceived as intelligent when \u201cit understands user requests, responds without continuous user intervention, exhibits awareness of the physical and virtual worlds, adapts to change, learns from acquired information and user behavior, and completes tasks within a favorable timeframe\u201d (p. 5).\nScholars have explored the perceived intelligence of IPAs from various perspectives. Moussawi et al. (2021) discovered that perceived intelligence affects anthropomorphism, PEOU,"}, {"title": "and PU. Similarly, Balakrishnan and Dwivedi (2024) found that it influenced user attitude and\npurchase intention. Priya and Sharma (2023) identified a positive relationship between perceived\nintelligence and utilitarian attitude, while Guha et al. (2023) revealed that it leads to a positive\nevaluation of IPAs. However, these studies have generally treated perceived intelligence as a\nunidimensional construct and did not validate its role in driving user acceptance and loyalty to\nIPAs. Moreover, the scales used in these studies do not adequately capture the unique\ncharacteristics of IPAs (Zhao et al., 2024), whose perception of intelligence largely depends on the\ntextual characteristics of the dialogue, the ability to perform tasks autonomously, and human-like\ntraits (Ling et al., 2023). Moussawi and Koufaris (2021) argued that treating perceived intelligence\nas a single-dimensional construct lacks sufficient depth in accurately measuring it. They advocated\nfor a comprehensive approach that captures all aspects of intelligent systems. Thus, this research\nconceptualizes perceived intelligence as a construct with three dimensions specifically reflecting\nthe unique characteristics of PIPAs: conversational intelligence, task intelligence, and perceived\nnaturalness.", "content": "Conversational intelligence is the ability of IPAs to comprehend and process users' natural language inputs smoothly and intuitively (Ling et al., 2023). This capability is achieved through \u201cnatural language understanding/processing, machine learning, conversation context recognition, and memory\u201d (Ling et al., 2023). Conversationally intelligent systems enhance user interactions by interpreting user queries, predicting user needs, and providing relevant and timely responses (Guha et al., 2023; Ling et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021). By leveraging these technologies, conversationally intelligent systems aim to make interactions feel natural and proactive, ensuring that users can communicate with the device as effortlessly as they would with another person.\nTask intelligence refers to the ability of IPAs to understand specific objectives or requests issued by users and execute associated tasks or commands proficiently, effectively, and in a contextually relevant manner (Moussawi & Koufaris, 2019; Zhao et al., 2024). This involves understanding the user's instructions and integrating contextual awareness to ensure the tasks are carried out accurately and appropriately (Guha et al., 2023; Moussawi et al., 2021). Task intelligence enables PIPAs to perform tasks and implement actions with minimal user intervention, such as controlling apps or devices, searching for information, and providing reminders or alerts (Hu et al., 2021a; Moussawi et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "Perceived naturalness refers to the extent to which users believe the voice of an IPA resembles\nthat of a human. Users often attribute human-like characteristics to technologies (Waytz et al.,\n2010). Perceived naturalness focuses on the user's impression of the speech quality of IPAs (Guha\net al., 2023; Kang et al., 2024); more natural-sounding speech can lead users to attribute human-\nlike traits to the device (Humphry & Chesher, 2021; Kang et al., 2024). This perception is\ninfluenced by factors such as tone, inflection, pauses, and conversational flow. Guha et al. (2023)\nexplain that the naturalness of speech affects whether users perceive an IPA as artificial or\nintelligent. When speech sounds more natural, users may believe they are conversing with a human\nrather than an AI device (Hu et al., 2021b; Kang et al., 2024). Perceived naturalness differs from\nconversational intelligence in that the latter relates to the system's technical ability to manage\nconversations effectively, while the former concerns the user's perception of the IPA's voice quality\nand how human-like it sounds.", "content": "These aspects of perceived intelligence were chosen because they address essential elements that determine how users perceive and interact with PIPAs like Rabbit R1. Conversational intelligence ensures that the PIPA can understand and respond to natural language inputs smoothly, facilitating effective communication.

By acquiring new knowledge, machine learning aims to reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve its own performance. Machine learning was proposed in the mid-1950s, and over the next 30 years, related research in the field of machine learning continued to develop. Machine learning has interdisciplinary attributes and has been widely applied in the field of artificial intelligence. Zhang and Wang [2016] argue that the way to transform big data into more valuable knowledge is by applying machine learning techniques. Through empirical research, they concluded that, to significantly improve the performance of machine learning models, the scale of data needs to be expanded. Guo and Feng [2010] state that the core of machine learning is learning, and the focus of research is how to enable machines to improve their performance in a way similar to humans, influenced by the external environment.\nMany scholars have conducted related research on machine learning algorithms: He et al. [2014] explored six machine learning algorithms in the context of big data, including big data divide-and-conquer strategies, sampling, feature selection, classification, clustering, association analysis, and parallel algorithms. Liu et al. [2017] discussed the issues and limitations of traditional machine learning and proposed parallel machine learning algorithms that are more suitable for handling large-scale, highly scalable data storage in big data environments. Xiao [2017] provided corresponding suggestions and methods for machine learning algorithms under big data, based on research into the current status, characteristics, and classification of big data in China. Cao [2017] discussed the fields involved in current machine learning and its roles, affirming that machine learning plays a significant role in advancing artificial intelligence, and predicted the future development of machine learning based on existing achievements.\nCurrently, research in the field of machine learning in China is becoming increasingly popular, and its application scope is expanding. By studying the current state of machine learning in China, it will have significant implications for the future development trends and directions of machine learning in the country. This paper uses CSSCI papers in the field of machine learning in China as the data source and presents and evaluates the research status and hot topics of machine learning through the form of knowledge graphs."}, {"title": "2 Data and Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Data Source", "content": "In order to scientifically study the current state and trends of development in the field of machine learning, the author uses the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database as the data source. The search term \"machine learning\" is used as the title, with the literature classified under \"Information Technology\". The time range for the publication of the papers is set from 2007 to 2017, and the search scope is limited to CSSCI journals."}, {"title": "2.2 Research Methods and Tools", "content": "With the advancement of technology, visualization analysis software has become a cutting-edge method for analyzing bibliometric information, providing intuitive visual processing and analysis of literature. CiteSpace is the primary analysis software used in this paper. Developed by scholars on the Java platform, CiteSpace is a highly visual tool. It has the ability to display, identify, and analyze the current status and development prospects of relevant research fields, making it a powerful visualization tool for analyzing scientific literature data Lin and Chen [2017]."}, {"title": "3 Bibliometric Analysis", "content": "This paper analyzes the research status of the field of machine learning over the past decade by compiling the number of CSSCI papers published each year, as shown in Figure 1. It is evident that from 2007 to 2012, the number of papers related to machine learning research in China showed a gradual increase, indicating that during this period, there were no groundbreaking advances in the field, and the research was progressing slowly. After 2014, however, the number of published papers surged sharply, marking this period as the outbreak of the research boom in domestic machine learning studies. Subsequently, the field's output grew rapidly. Particularly after the 2016 victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol in the game of Go, artificial intelligence once again gained significant attention from scholars. During the period of 2016 to 2017, the focus and importance of machine learning research increased rapidly, becoming a major research hotspot."}, {"title": "3.1 Institutional Distribution", "content": "The research status of machine learning in China is analyzed from the perspective of institutions and academic teams. Using CiteSpace, high-output research institutions were identified, as shown in Figure 2. From the perspective of published literature, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Jilin University, and Zhejiang University are the leading institutions in machine learning research. This indicates that these three research institutions have strong influence and research capabilities in the field of machine learning. Following closely behind are seven other research institutions, including the National University of Defense Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Harbin Institute of Technology.\nTo analyze the collaboration between research institutions, relevant parameters were set in CiteSpace. The thresholds for C/CC/CCV were set as (2, 2, 20), (4, 3, 20), and (4, 3, 20), respectively. Additional settings included Top N=30, Top"}, {"title": "3.2 Author Distribution", "content": "An analysis of the distribution of authors in the field of machine learning was conducted. Among all the retrieved documents, a total of 46 authors were identified. Based on the bibliometric law of prolific authors, the top ten authors by publication volume were selected for statistical analysis, as shown in Figure 4. Notably, 2/5 of the prolific authors come from Soochow University, once again proving the scientific research level and strength of this research team in the field. It is also worth noting that scholars from Fudan University, Nanchang University, and Hunan University of Technology are closely following, with significant publication volumes as well.\nAn analysis of author collaboration was conducted, with the CiteSpace parameter settings consistent with those previously described. The generated collaboration network map for machine learning research institutions is shown in Figure 3. The font size of the labels represents the strength of centrality-the larger the font size, the stronger the centrality. Node rings indicate annual layers, while edges reflect collaboration relationships between institutions.\nThe results reveal that the network consists of N = 46 nodes, E = 32 edges, and a network density of $Density = 0.0372$. Considering that there are as many as 26 institutions involved in machine learning research, this network density is relatively low. This indicates that collaboration among domestic authors is rare, with a general lack of collaborative awareness. Moreover, the limited collaboration that does occur is often confined within the same research institution, rather than forming robust cross-institutional research groups."}, {"title": "3.3 Keyword Co-Occurrence Ranking", "content": "Keywords typically represent the key focus areas of research within a specific field. By conducting a co-occurrence analysis of keywords, it is possible to accurately grasp the current state and research hotspots of a field. The concept of keyword co-occurrence originates from bibliometrics, specifically citation analysis and bibliographic coupling theory, which is used to analyze the strength of connections between documents Wen and Wen [2016].\nIn CiteSpace, the \"Keyword\" node type was selected, with parameter settings consistent with those previously described. The generated keyword co-occurrence knowledge map is shown in Figure 5. The map reveals a total of 235 nodes and 754 connections.\nThe co-occurrence relationships between keywords are reflected through the edges connecting nodes in the figure ??. The size of a node indicates the frequency of the corresponding keyword\u2014larger nodes represent higher frequencies."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion and Recommendations", "content": "This study utilizes CiteSpace visualization software to analyze machine learning literature cited in China's CSSCI from 2007 to 2017 by generating knowledge maps. The conclusions and recommendations based on the findings are as follows:\n\u2022 Temporal Distribution Map.

The distribution maps of research institutions and authors reveal that numerous institutions are involved in the field of machine learning, presenting a diversified landscape. Strong research teams have emerged, such as those from Soochow University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Jilin University, and Zhejiang University. However, collaboration between institutions remains insufficient. While prolific authors have contributed significantly to the field's development, their collaboration is mostly limited within their own institutions, with limited cross-institutional exchanges. Additionally, some authors have followed trends blindly, leading to overlapping research outcomes and a lack of research depth. Research institutions should ensure that increased funding for research is accompanied by efforts to maintain researchers' enthusiasm and focus. Organizing research exchange activities could help establish a stable and positive collaborative environment to collectively advance the field.\n\u2022 Keyword Co-Occurrence Map. The keyword co-occurrence map reveals that related algorithms such as support vector machines, neural networks, and data mining are widely emphasized and discussed, attracting significant attention. However, from a broader perspective, the keyword structure of machine learning research remains relatively dispersed, indicating that research hotspots have yet to converge.\n\u2022 Co-Citation Information. The co-citation analysis shows that the most frequently cited journals and papers in the field of machine learning are concentrated in information and computer-related journals, highlighting the technical nature of the field. The high proportion of research published in information-related journals demonstrates the importance attached to this field and the strong support for the publication of its research outcomes.\n\u2022 Research Frontiers Temporal Map. The temporal map of research frontiers indicates that the field of machine learning covers a wide range of topics and exhibits significant interdisciplinary characteristics. The rise of artificial intelligence has accelerated the development of algorithms such as random forests and convolutional neural networks in machine learning.

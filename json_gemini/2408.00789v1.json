Digital agriculture approaches can be used to replace all traditional agricultural system at\nvery reasonable costs. It is very effective in optimising large-scale management of resources, while traditional techniques cannot\neven tackle the problem. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic management zone delineation approach based on Machine Learn-\ning clustering algorithms using crop yield data, elevation and soil texture maps and available NDVI data. Our proposed dynamic\nmanagement zone delineation approach is useful for analysing the spatial variation of yield zones. Delineation of yield regions\nbased on historical yield data augmented with topography and soil physical properties helps farmers to economically and sustain-\nably deploy site-specific management practices identifying persistent issues in a field. The use of frequency maps is capable of\ncapturing dynamically changing incidental issues within a growing season. The proposed zone management approach can help\nfarmers/agronomists to apply variable-rate N fertilisation more effectively by analysing yield potential and stability zones with\nsatellite-based NDVI monitoring.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Agriculture 4.0 is using many modern research and technolo-\ngies in different aspects of agriculture including genomics, nan-\notechnology, synthetic proteins, Internet of Things, automation\nand machine learning [1]. As an important pillar in this space,\ndata-driven agriculture has gain a momentum in last twenty\nyears as a retrofitting mechanism for the available technologies\nto feed 9 billion population in 2050. It has become more realis-\ntic than ever due to wider use of sensors, cloud computing and\ntheir integration with cyber-physical-social farming systems to\nuse big data for intuition, intelligence and insights. However,\ndata-driven agriculture is challenging for small actors but im-\nportant for global sustainability compared to others industries\nsuch as healthcare, fin-tech and manufacturing. Those chal-\nlenges come with small profit margins, climate change activi-\nties, ever decreeing land and labour. But certainly data-driven\nsystems in agriculture sheds some light on sustainable intensi-\nfication in agriculture to reduce environmental footprint and to\nmaximise economic returns [2].\nArable farming contributes considerably to the world food\nproduction as cereal a main staple food and also as a sustain-\nable crop in different climatic regions in the world. Several new\ntechnologies for better data collections are becoming available\nin crop framing such as soil scans, remote and proximal crop\ngrowth sensing, yield quality and quantity monitoring, granular\nweather monitoring, etc. Arable fields naturally have contiguity\nof those data of within-field variations for regionalization based\non homogeneous sub-fields [3]. Farmers and agronomists look\ninto site-specific management practices of large fields by cap-\nturing time and spatial variability. Due to economic and logistic\nreasons, soil sampling are not frequent enough to understand\nits impact on annual yield. For example P, K, Mg are tested\nonce for three years. However, altitude, soil texture data are not\nchanged or changed slowly. Based on our data management ex-\nperience in UK farms, yield maps are being collected by many\nfarmers in the last two decades. Most of the analyses have been\nfocused on spatial variability of individual maps. Due to lack of\nconsecutive number of yield maps and crop rotation complexi-\nties, both spatio-temporal analysis has been limited so far [? ].\nTherefore, many farmers, agronomists and scientists are inter-\nested in looking at the relations of those data layers, deriving\ncompound new data layers and accordingly make site-specific\ndecisions in seeding, fertilization, sub-soiling etc [4].\nPing et. al. [5] and Luck et. at [6] focused on cleaning data\nand analysing a single yield map to identify different zones us-\ning uni-variate statistical techniques. Identifying yield poten-\ntial areas with precise zone boundaries helped to understand\nissues with current growing season. However, by stacking a\nset of yield maps in the past years to generate a yield fre-\nquency map helped identifying more persistent issues within\na field such as soil compaction, erosion, water logging etc [7],\n[8]. With farmers' local knowledge and agronomists' exper-\ntise, they make some useful decisions based on those homo-\ngeneous zones. Later studies [9] combined those maps with\nother auxiliary data layers using multi-variate techniques. Ler-\noux et al. [10] developed a stable temporal and spatial yield"}, {"title": "2. Materials and Methods", "content": "Data used in this study is based on 3 cereal growing farms\nfrom the main Winter Wheat growing region of eastern and\nsouthern England. All three farms grew winter or spring va-\nrieties of wheat, oil seed rape, barley or beans in rotations on\nrain-fed (rainfall concentrated on winter months) lands. Three\nfarms are selected to represent three different climatic regions\nin the UK (Table 1). The climate is classified as temperate with\ncool winters and warm summers with wet weather throughout\nthe year. Minimum and maximum temperatures occur in Jan-\nuary and June, respectively."}, {"title": "2.2. Yield Data", "content": "Since 1992 when AgLeader introduced grain yield mapping\ntechnologies into their combine-harvesters, yield maps are gen-\nerated by many such machineries. It took several more years\n(until selective availability restriction in GPS systems was de-\ncommissioned in 2000 for higher resolution) to integrate more\naccurate differential GPS into the mapping systems. The num-\nber of consecutive years the maps were available for the farm-\ners was limited in the past 20 years. Therefore, those maps\nhave vastly been under-utilised by the agri-tech companies,\nagronomists and the growers. Lack of end-user computational\npower and integrated decision-support systems for agronomists\nand farmers has also hindered new innovations to use such a\nvaluable resource.\nFor the fields we have selected yield monitoring maps are\navailable for several consecutive years. For farm A, 7 maps\nfrom 2013 to 2019, for farm B, 10 maps from 2008 to 2017,\nand for farm C, 7 maps from 2013 to 2019 (except 2014) are\navailable. A summary of the availability of the yield maps for\nthose fields is shown in Table 3. Table 3 also shows which years\nWinter Wheat was grown on the fields. Farm A has grown Bar-\nley Winter, Rape Winter and Beans Dried Winter in rotations\nwith the Winter Wheat. Farm B has grown Barley Spring and\nRape Winter in rotations.\nYield maps usually contain a set of errors and not uniformly\nsampled across a field since it logs data points according to the\nmovements of the combine. Therefore, cleaning the yield maps\nto identify spatially contiguous set of different yield regions is\nimportant. The accuracy of any pre-processing workflow, de-\npends on any approach for accurately identifying yield regions.\nWe follow a combined temporal and spatial data pre-processing\npipeline for filtering, smoothing, removing outliers, interpola-\ntions etc. to generate cleaned yield maps.\nFirst, we take a raw yield map and remove any data points\nspecified to be excluded, if the combine-harvester yield map-\nping software has identified and indicated them as data points\nwith errors (e.g., harvester not moving or moving outside the\nfield, moving with header up, sudden stop etc.).

After deriving\na series of results on the relationship between competition and diversity, we will empirically\ntest them by using language models to play Scattergories against one another. In our model,\nproducers generate content from one of K distinct types, where K might be very large. In\nScattergories, K would represent the number of possible responses, valid or otherwise, to a\n(letter, category) pair. 4 A producer who generates content of type $k \\in [K]$ derives utility\nthat depends on (1) the value of that type of content $d_k$ (e.g., 1 if it is a valid Scattergories\nanswer and 0 otherwise) and (2) the total number of players $C_k$ who produce content of the\nsame type.\nPlayers use GAITs to produce content. We model a GAIT as a permutation $\\pi$on the\nK answer types: while a GAIT's distribution can be tuned, we assume that a user cannot\nchange the ranking of answer types. Intuitively, under our assumption, players cannot induce\na GAIT to sample a \u201cworse\u201d answer with higher likelihood than a \u201cbetter\u201d one. We discuss\nthis assumption in greater detail in Section 3.\nAlthough it is directly inspired by Scattergories, our model describes a broad range of\nsettings involving the use of generative AI. For example, travellers have begun to use GAITS\nto plan vacations [100]. But because travellers compete for limited resources like hotel rooms\nand restaurant reservations at popular destinations, they impose negative externalities on\none another. Algorithmic monoculture could result in the same recommended destinations\nor activities, and savvy travellers or GAIT developers might diversify their tools' output\ndistributions to increase the likelihood of sampling less crowded (though potentially less\ndesirable) destinations. More generally, whenever two GAIT users would prefer that, holding\nquality fixed, they each received distinct generations, our formulation may prove relevant."}, {"title": "Competition under a Single Tool", "content": "We are now ready to analyze behavior under our model.

A single person playing Scattergories by\nthemselves has no need to choose obscure (and potentially incorrect) answers; they simply\nneed a single valid answer. But with more competition, a player must sample from a more\ndiverse distribution in order to avoid collisions with others. Our main results in this section\nformalize this intuition. We show in Theorems 4.5 and 4.6 that more competitive environ-\nments do indeed induce more diverse behavior. On the other hand, we show in Theorem 4.7\nthat the equilibrium distribution $p_{EQ}(n, d, s)$ is less diverse than the optimal distribution\n$p_{OPT}(n, d, s)$. We then discuss limiting behavior of competition.\nFirst, we must define \u201cdiversity\u201d more precisely. All of our results will use a particularly\nstrong notion of the relative diversity of distributions known as majorization:\nDefinition 4.4 (Majorization). For distributions $p, q \\in \\Delta(\\pi)$, $p$ majorizes $q$ if\n$\\sum_{l=1}^{k} p_{\\downarrow l} \\geq \\sum_{l=1}^{k} q_{\\downarrow l}$ \\quad (\\forall k \\in [K])$\nWe write this as $p \\succ q$.\nMajorization provides a useful notion of the relative diversity of discrete distributions.\nBy definition, if $p \\succ q$, then $\\phi(p) \\leq \\phi(q)$ for any Schur-concave function $\\phi$ [e.g., 66]. (And\nsimilarly, $p \\succ q$ implies $\\phi(p) \\geq \\phi(q)$ for any Schur-convex function $\\phi$.) Standard measures\nof diversity, such as Shannon [83], R\u00e9nyi [75], and Tsallis [94] entropies, are Schur-concave.\nAs a result, $p \\succ q$ implies p has lower entropy than q. Similarly, measures of inequality like\nthe Gini coefficient [31] are Schur-convex, so we can also interpret $p \\succ q$ to say that p is more\n\u201cunequal\u201d than q. We will present our results in terms of majorization, and intuitively, we\ncan understand \u201c$p$ majorizes $q$\u201d ($p \\succ q$) as \u201c$p$ is less diverse than $q$.\u201d We begin by showing\nthat increasing the number of players n increases equilibrium diversity.

Consider the following thought experiment: what\nif, in the $n + 1$ player game $\\mathcal{I}(n + 1, d, s)$, all players played $p = p_{EQ}(n, d, s)$? We show\nthat if they did, per-type expected utility $d_k u(n, p_k)$ would be increasing in $k$ (for $k$ such\nthat $p_k > 0$): playing the n-player equilibrium strategy in the $n + 1$-player game would\nover-exploit the types with high $d_k$ and under-exploit those with lower $d_k$.\nBy Lemma 4.1, under the $n + 1$-player equilibrium $p_{EQ}(n + 1, d, s)$, types should have\nequal conditional utility. So in order to transform $p_{EQ}(n, d, s)$ into $p_{EQ}(n + 1, d, s)$, we have\nto decrease probabilities on the high-$d_k$ types and raise them on the low-$d_k$ types. This\nseems like it should lead to a more diverse distribution, since we are lowering the larger\nprobabilities and raising the smaller probabilities, and indeed, we show that this implies\n$p_{EQ}(n, d, s) \\succ p_{EQ}(n + 1, d, s)$."}, {"title": "Price of anarchy", "content": "Optimal behavior is more diverse than equilibrium behavior, and while they may coincide in\nthe limit, equilibria will in general be suboptimal.

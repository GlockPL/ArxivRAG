There are several reasons of why this problem is important. For example, experts might have access to different data when creating their models, but might not have access to the data available to other experts, while there might be a modeller who can access the expert's opinions and put them together into a single model. Furthermore, experts might specialise in certain areas of the support of the input space, so that a modeller with access to the expert's opinions could potentially produce a single model exploiting the strengths of each modeller. This problem is commonly known as \u201cmixture of experts\u201d, \"expert aggregation\u201d, \u201cmerging of experts\" or \"expert pooling\" [40, 22, 6, 31, 30].\nThe merging of experts problem is usually ill-defined, in the sense that there are multiple joint models (that is, models that include all covariates) that after marginalisation would render the same prediction as the individual experts (that is, those which include only some of the covariates). This ill-definedness of the problem requires strong inductive biases. One way to provide this inductive bias in a principled way is through the Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle [20]. In brief, MAXENT suggests finding the distribution with maximum Shannon entropy subject to moment constraints. This turns out to be the same as choosing the distribution closest to the uniform distribution having the same moments as those given by the constraints. In Section 2.2 we introduce MAXENT and Causal MAXENT (CMAXENT) in more detail, the latter being an extension that allows to include causal information when available [17]."}, {"title": "", "content": "Most of the research on the merging of predictors focuses on finding a meta-predictor that uses the given models and best fits to the data [41], whereas the focus of the present article is understanding the implications of causal assumptions in the merging of experts instead of aiming for models with best performance. Furthermore, most of this research focuses on predictors that use the same predicting variables for each of the models. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is the random subspace method, notable for being the basis of random forests [15].\nWhat if in addition to the different models, a researcher has some causal knowledge of the underlying system? For example, they could know whether a variable or set of variables used in a particular model are causes or effects of the target variable, potentially changing the resulting predictor of interest. Causal knowledge produces asymmetries that have been exploited in the past to understand some common machine learning tasks like transfer learning, semi-supervised learning or distribution shift [35, 39, 18, 21].\nIn the present work, we investigate how including causal knowledge produces asymmetric results when merging predictors. In particular, we are interested in how solutions to the CMAXENT principle [17] differ when we assume different causal relations for the same data. That is, we are interested in the asymmetries produced by causal assumptions on CMAXENT inferences. In particular, we will study the differences in the solutions when we assume the causal data generation process (so that the covariates or predictors are causal parents of our target variable) in contrast with the anticausal generation process (so that the predictors are causal children of our target variable). We are going to study these asymmetries in the case where we do not observe all the variables jointly; one of the differentiating characteristics of this research with respect to other merging of predictors work.\nIncluding the right causal assumptions when merging predictors is relevant, for instance, in the medical domain. Suppose we are interested in the presence or absence of a disease, and we have models from hospitals and labs relating risk factors and symptoms to the disease we are interested in. Combining the predictors would be valuable to predict the disease but it also requires to include the right causal assumptions, if the direction matters for the merging of predictors: risk factors cause diseases and diseases cause symptoms. The literature of merging of predictors has focused on important aspects of the resulting models like generalisation bounds or speed of estimation but the relation to causality has remained largely unexplored.\nPrevious approaches have considered the problem of merging of experts using MAXENT [25, 27, 34]. However, such research considers the problem from a purely statistical perspective and does not study the ramifications of different causal assumptions. In fact, the way they study the aggregation problem is by merging the probability of the outcome given by each expert without regarding how these probabilities were produced.\nThe main contributions of this article can be summarised as follows\n\u2022 We study the differences in causal and anticausal merging of predictors whenever the inductive bias used to merge the predictors allows causal information to be included.\n\u2022 In particular, we find that CMAXENT with a binary target and continuous covariates, reduces to logistic regression and LDA, two classic classification algorithms, when merging predictors in causal and anticausal directions, respectively.\n\u2022 Furthermore, we study the implications of these asymmetries Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation whenever we do not observe all the first and second moments as constraints in the CMAXENT problem.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we introduce basic notation and give a brief overview of MAXENT and CMAXENT. Then, in Section 3 we present the optimisation problem in the causal and anticausal direction and give the explicit solutions of the problems, thereby connecting the solutions of CMAXENT to well-known classification algorithms. In addition, we prove that the decision boundary in the causal and anticausal directions, with full knowledge of the moments (as defined in the section itself) renders equal slopes of the predictors. In Section 4 we weaken the assumption of full knowledge of the moments and instead assume knowledge of a subset of the moments in Section 3. Partial knowledge of the moments have implications for Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation and resulting in differences in decision boundaries. We close with Section 5 with some discussion and concluding remarks.

To be precise, p(Y, X) is a density with respect to the product of the Lebesgue measure and the counting measure. We denote Ep [f(Y, X)] the expectation of f with respect to p. We restrict ourselves to the scenario with two continuous variables and one binary outcome given that we can already observe asymmetries in the merging of experts, and can visualise such asymmetries without having to project such space into 2 dimensions. The results here can be easily generalised into a discrete outcome variable (and indeed we do, in Corollary 7). Throughout the article we will care about finding a predictor of Y using X as covariates. That is, we are interested in the density p(Y | X).\n2.2 Maximum Entropy and Causal Maximum Entropy\nThe Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle was born in the statistical mechanics literature as a way to find a distribution consistent with a set of expectation constraints [20]. That is, given observed sample averages fi = \u2211i=1 f(yi, xi) we find the density p(Y, X) so that the expectations with respect to p(Y, X) are equal to those observed.\nN\nNotice that MAXENT does not attempt to find the 'true' distribution of the data, but instead the distribution closest to the uniform distribution so that the expectation constraints are satisfied. We will see examples of such optimisation problems in subsequent sections. Using the Lagrange multiplier formalism for constrained optimisation, one can prove that the solution to the MAXENT problem belongs to the exponential family. The MAXENT distribution and its properties have been studied widely, see Gr\u00fcnwald and Dawid [10] and Wainwright et al. [38] and references therein.\nIn Causal MAXENT (CMAXENT, Janzing [17]), the optimisation is performed in an assumed causal order; that is, we first find the MAXENT distribution of causes and then the Maximum Conditional Entropy of the effects given the inferred distribution of the causes. As argued in [36] this typically results in distributions that are more plausible for the respective causal direction. One can think of CMAXENT as usual MAXENT with the distribution of the cause as additional constraint, where the latter has been obtained via separate entropy maximization."}, {"title": "3 Known predictor covariances", "content": "We will begin by studying the solution of the CMAXENT problem when we observe all the bivariate distributions and summarise them with first and second moments. The restriction to first and second moments has several reasons: First, these simple constraints are already sufficient to explain the interesting asymmetries between causal and anticausal. Second, including higher order moments makes the problem computationally harder and increases the risk of overfitting on noisy finite sample results. Last, including more moments decreases the asymmetries between the causal directions. Mathematically, we have the following (estimated) expectations and their respective sample averages:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{E}[Y] = q,\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbf{\\phi} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\phi_1 \\\\\n\\phi_2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{E}[XX^\\intercal] = \\mathbf{\\Sigma_x} \\triangleq \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\varsigma_1^2 & \\varsigma_{1,2} \\\\\n\\varsigma_{1,2} & \\varsigma_2^2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\tag{2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we assumed the mean of X is zero.\n3.1 The causal direction\nConsider the causal graph in Figure la and the expectations given in Equations (1) and (2).

This relation was further explored in [24], where a more direct relation to maximum likelihood and exponential families was established.

After this two-step process, we are left with the joint density p(Y, X) from which we can derive a predictor of Y, p(Y | X) using Bayes' Theorem (Section 3.3).

The main result of this section is that with the constraints we have used, CMAXENT in the anticausal direction is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis [14, Section 4.3]. Furthermore, we generalise this result to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and to an exponential family version of discriminant analysis.\nTheorem 5 (Predictor of Y using Bayes' rule). Using the results from Propostion 3, the density $P_x(Y = y | X)$ is the ratio of the product of the Gaussian component with $p_x(Y = y)$ and the mixture of Gaussians resulting from Propostion 3. Minimising the expected 0-1 loss, the optimal decision rule arising from this density is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).\nCorollary 6 (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)).

Let $f_i$ be an arbitrary measurable function and $f$ its corresponding sample average.

All of these analyses base their results on the fact that the logistic regression does not make an assumption on how the covariates X are distributed, whereas LDA does.\nAn alternative way of viewing this distinction is through the lens of generative and discriminative models. LDA is a generative model since it models both covariates and target variable and logistic regression only models the target as a function of the input. Ng and Jordan [28] analyse the difference in efficiency between the Naive Bayes algorithm (a generative model similar to LDA) and logistic regression, and find that both models have regimes in which they perform better than the other.

In other words, X2 becomes irrelevant in the estimation of our target predictor.\nIn the anticausal direction, the distribution of the cause Y is unchanged because P(Y) is determined by the constraints and thus does not depend on $\\phi_2$. However, using the fact that the Gaussian distribution maximises the entropy over all distributions with the same variance [37, Theorem 8.6.5.], we can derive a bound on $\\phi_2$.

We can consider this an instance of Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation studied in [16, 12], where we can exploit causal information and partial data to make models including variables that were never observed jointly with the target.\n4.2 Unknown predictor covariance\nNow suppose we observe all the sample averages in Equations (1) and (2) but we do not observe $\\varsigma_{1,2}$.\nIn the causal direction this implies that the multivariate Gaussian distribution resulting from the MAXENT problem on X is diagonal, that is, X are marginally independent. The exponential form of px(Y | X) does not change, as we still observed q and $\\phi$, nevertheless, the parameters of the exponential family do change, as the density of X changed so that the resulting px(Y | X) needs to adapt in order to match $\\phi$.\nNow we will explore the anticausal case. We will proceed as in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. First we find p(Y) by maximising the entropy subject to the empirical average of Y, which is trivial because p(Y) is already determined by its moments, and then we find p(X | Y) subject to all the moments in Equations (1) and (2) with the exception of $\\varsigma_{1,2}$.

Contrary to Remark 4, where we concluded that CMAXENT is not always Markov relative to a DAG.\nIn Appendix E we derive the slopes of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction when we do not know the covariance between the predictors. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for which the slopes are the same. From this simple example, we have learned the following: in causal direction, our inductive bias tells us that the covariates are not correlated and hence, the decision boundary depends only on the marginal variance of each $X_i$ and the covariance between Y and X. In the anticausal direction, CMAXENT infers X1 and X2 to be marginally correlated because they need to be conditionally independent (this fact can proved using the law of total covariance). Hence, the marginal covariance of X, Ex is different in both scenarios. This is something we did not observe in the case with full information (Section 3).\nIn addition, we derive the expressions of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction (see Appendix E).

We will use the first and second moments of each variable, the covariance between each X\u2081 and Y, the covariance between X\u2081 and X2, and between X3 and X4, as constraints.\nUsing CMAXENT, we first find the density p(X1, X2) with maximum entropy subject to the moment constraints; then p(Y | X1, X2) with maximum entropy subject to the moment constraints (including p(X1, X2), found in the previous step); and finally the density p(X3, X4 | Y) that maximises the entropy subject to the moment constraints (again, including the found p(Y)).\nIt is possible to see that these process will result in the same predictors as in Section 3. That is, we find that p(X1, X2) is a multivariate Gaussian, p(Y | X1, X2) a logistic-like regression, and p(X3, X4 | Y) a Mixture of Bivariate Gaussians.\nThese distributions provide us with enough information to find the joint distribution of all our variables P(Y, X1, X2, X3, X4), with which we can derive our predictor of interest. We have\n\\begin{equation}\nP(y | X_1, X_2, X_"}]}

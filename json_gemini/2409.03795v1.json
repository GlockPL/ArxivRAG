MPLS operates by attaching labels to data packets, allowing routers to forward packets based on label values rather than complex network addresses. This approach facilitates faster data transfer, reduces latency, and supports Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, making it ideal for both service providers and enterprise networks [Arm00].\nDespite these advantages, MPLS networks are not immune to security threats. The inherent characteristics of MPLS, such as label-based routing and label distribution, introduce unique vulnerabilities. Understanding these vulnerabilities and developing effective mitigation strategies are crucial for maintaining network security and performance."}, {"title": "MPLS Network Architecture", "content": "MPLS networks consist of several key components:\n\u2022 Label Switch Routers (LSRs): These routers are responsible for forwarding packets based on label values.

They assign labels to incoming packets and remove labels from outgoing packets [YM02].\n\u2022 Label Distribution Protocols: Protocols such as Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [GEBS10] and Resource Reservation Protocol with Traffic Engineering extensions (RSVP-TE) [Ber03] are used to distribute and manage labels within the network.\nThe forwarding process in MPLS networks can be represented using graph theory. Consider a network graph G = (V, E), where V represents nodes (LSRs and LERs) and E represents directed edges (network links). Each edge e \u2208 E is associated with a label l.

This threat can be particularly damaging, as it may lead to traffic being rerouted improperly or intercepted by unauthorized parties.\nTo understand label spoofing, we can model it as a perturbation in the label distribution protocol. Let L denote the set of valid labels, and let Latt \u2282 L represent the set of spoofed labels. The probability Pspoof of a successful spoofing attack can be defined as:\nPspoof = Pr (Spoofed Label Accepted | Latt)\nAssuming that labels are uniformly distributed, L can be expressed as L = {l1, l2,..., lm}, where m is the total number of labels. Under this assumption, the probability of an attacker successfully injecting a spoofed label is given by:\nPspoof = \\frac{|L_{att}|}{m}\nwhere Latt denotes the number of spoofed labels. To incorporate the dynamic nature of label distribution and switching, we extend the model to include label switching probabilities P(li \u2192 lj).

The amount of intercepted information I is given by:\nI = H(X) Pr(Interception)\nwhere Pr(Interception) is the probability of interception occurring. If S denotes the size of the secure data, the ratio Rintercept of intercepted information to the total secure data can be expressed as:\nR_{intercept} = \\frac{I}{S} = \\frac{H(X) \\cdot Pr(Interception)}{S}\nA higher Rintercept value indicates a greater risk of information exposure, highlighting the potential severity of interception.\nTo mitigate the risk of traffic interception, the following strategies can be employed:\n\u2022 Encryption: Encrypting the data transmitted over the network can significantly reduce the risk of interception.

However, in the realm of few-shot learning, where only a limited amount of data is available for training, QML demonstrates suboptimal performance. In classical machine learning, diffusion models have been validated as effective zero-shot classifiers and hold significant potential for addressing few-shot learning problems[5, 6]. Nevertheless, in the domain of QML, the utilization of quantum diffusion models (QDMs) for few-shot learning remains largely unexplored[7]. This is primarily due to the limitations of quantum computing resources and the inherent noise associated with quantum computers, despite the QDM's demonstrated success in generative tasks[8].\nIn this work, we propose three new algorithms based on the QDM to address the few-shot learning problem. Our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 The QDM has demonstrated strong performance in generative tasks. Building on QDM's generative capabilities, we propose the Label-Guided Generation Inference (LGGI) algorithm to address the few-shot learning problem.

A Quantum Neural Network (QNN) has been used to perform various machine learning tasks. It typically consists of a data encoder E(x) that embeds a classical input x into a quantum state x), a variational quantum circuit (VQC) Q that generates the output state, and a measurement layer M that maps the output quantum state to a classical vector. Fig. 1 shows some VQC ansatz examples[9\u201312] used for QNNs. Given a training dataset, the input data\nx is transformed into a quantum input feature map using E(x). A parameterized VQC ansatz is then utilized to manipulate the quantum input feature through unitary transformations. Finally, the predicted classification is obtained by measuring the quantum state. The loss function is predefined to calculate the difference between the output of the QNN and the true target value y. Training a QNN involves iteratively searching for the optimal parameters in the VQC through a hybrid quantum-classical optimization procedure.\nQuantum Few-shot Learning (QFSL). Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning approach designed to address supervised learning challenges with a very limited number of training samples. Specifically, it involves a support set and a query set. The support set consists of a small number of labeled examples from which the model learns, encompassing n classes, each with k samples, hence called n-way k-shot learning. The query set is a collection of unlabeled examples that the model needs to classify into one of the n classes. Existing solutions to the QFSL problem can be categorized into data-based, model-based, and algorithm-based methods[13]. Quantum Few-shot learning (QFSL) involves using QNNs as classifiers to solve QFSL problems[14, 15]. However, traditional algorithms used in QFSL often underperform due to the limited computational resources available and the noise present in real quantum devices.\nQuantum Diffusion Model (QDM). Diffusion model (DM)[16, 17] is a popular approach for generating images and other high-dimensional data. It comprises two main processes: the diffusion process and the denoising process. During the diffusion process, noise is gradually added to the data over a series of steps, transforming it into a simpler distribution, as formulated by (1), in which \u039d(\u00b7; \u03bc, \u03a3) denotes the normal distribution of mean \u00b5 and covariance \u03a3, \u03b2t is a small positive constant that controls the amount of noise added at step t, and I is the identity matrix.\n$$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I)$$\n(1)\nThe denoising process aims to learn how to reverse the forward process and incrementally remove noise to generate new data from the noise, with its training objective formulated by\n$$E_{q(x_{o:T})} [\\sum_{t=1}^T D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_o) || p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))]$$\n(2)\nin which q(xt-1|Xt, xo) is the posterior distribution of the forward process and the parameterized model po (Xt-1|2t) can predict the data point at the previous step given the current noisy data point. The denoising process is described by\n$$p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = N(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t,t)).$$\n(3)\nThe QDM, which integrates QML and DM, is utilized for generative tasks within the quantum domain, including quantum state generation and quantum circuit design. The quantum denoising diffusion model (QDDM)[7] is acknowledged as the leading quantum diffusion method for image generation. It outperforms classical models with similar parameter counts, while leveraging the efficiencies of quantum computing. Fig. 3 shows the framework of QDDM and its image generation process is illustrated in Fig. 2. In our work, we extend the QDDM with a label-guided mechanism to fully leverage the capabilities of QDDM in addressing the QFSL problems. This is achieved by introducing an additional qubit and applying a Pauli-X rotation by an angle of 2\u03c0y/n, where y represents the specified label and n denotes the total number of classes."}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "To address the QFSL problems, we propose methods from both data and algorithmic perspectives.

The primary reason for the suboptimal performance of QFSL is the limited availability of training data. Thus, from a data perspective, expanding the training dataset can significantly enhance the performance of QFSL. The QDDM is highly effective in generation tasks, making it suitable for augmenting the training dataset. Initially, a small amount of training data is used to train the QDDM. Once trained, the QDDM is employed to expand the training dataset for QNN. This expanded dataset is then used to train the QNN, which in turn improves its inference accuracy on real data.\nTo enhance the quality of data generated by the QDDM, we employ a label-guided generation method. During the QDDM training process, we perform amplitude encoding on the classical data and angle encoding on the labels. During the data generation process, we use random noise and the label as input, enabling the QDDM to generate data according to the specified label. Fig. 2 illustrates the data generation process under different label guidance. Fig. 4 describes the QDiff-LGGI algorithm."}, {"title": "3.2 QDiff-Based Label-Guided Noise Addition Inference (QDiff-LGNAI)", "content": "The learning objective of the QDDM outlined in Equation 2 relies on using a noise predictor to estimate the noise in noisy data compared to the actual noise. The noise predictor's estimation is guided by a label, with different labels corresponding to different noise predictions. By using the correct label for guidance, the error between the predicted noise and the actual noise is minimized. Based on this principle, we propose the QDM-Based Label-Guided Noise Addition Inference (Diff-LGNAI) method, shown in the Fig. 5.\nWe first utilize a small amount of training data to complete the training of the QDDM. Once trained, the noise predictor P within the QDDM is used for subsequent inference. For a given input xo, the possible labels are {L1, L2, ..., Lm}. Noise is gradually added to xo over Titerations. Specifically, at each time step t, xt is calculated as xt\u22121 + \u20act, where et ~ N(xt\u22121, W[t]), and W represents the noise weight. The noise predictor P is then employed to estimate the noise in the noisy data xt, guided by various possible labels, resulting in the predicted noise set {P(xt|L1),...,P(xt|Lm)}. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted noise and the actual noise, MSE(P(xt Li), et). The error is computed for each possible label, and the label with the minimum average error over T iterations is selected as the predicted label:\n$$arg \\min_{L_i \\in L} \\sum_{t=1}^T MSE(P(x_t|L_i), \\epsilon_t).$$"}, {"title": "3.3 QDiff-Based Label-Guided Denoising Inference (QDiff-LGDI)", "content": "During the denoising phase of QDDM, the noise predictor is used to estimate the noise present in the noisy data, which is then subtracted from the noisy data. This denoising process is repeated over Titerations. The noise prediction is guided by labels, with each label producing distinct noise estimates. The data generated under the guidance of the true label is expected to be most similar to the original data. In this framework, we propose the QDiff-Based Label-Guided Denoising Inference (QDiff-LGDI) method.\nFor an input xo, we gradually add noise to xo over Titerations, resulting in progressively noisier data {X1,X2,...,XT}. Then, we use the noise predictor P to predict the noise in the noisy data under the guidance of label Li, obtaining P(xT|Li). The predicted noise is subtracted from the noisy data. This denoising process is also performed over Titerations, producing progressively noise-reduced data {XT+1,XT+2,...,x2T}, where XT+t+1|Li = XT+t - P(XT+t|Li).

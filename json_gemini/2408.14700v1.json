Introduction", "content": "Landscape architecture (LA) [118, 55] is a beautiful place where humans and nature are integrated, providing valuable green spaces for cities and offering leisure, entertainment, and cultural experiences for people. Specifically, LA refers to the creation of landscape spaces with aesthetic value and human significance through the arrangement of the natural environment and artistic conception, meeting people's needs for leisure, recreation, and appreciation of nature. It is an interdisciplinary subject involving landscape design, garden planning, plant configuration, water landscape construction, and other aspects. With the rapid development of urbanization and increasing environmental pressures, scholars have begun to explore the relevant applications of artificial intelligence (AI) [120, 186] in LA.\nAI can accurately and scientifically identify and analyze the preliminary conditions of a project, establish design logic, evaluate design results and network computing, output actual design results, perform intelligent calculations based on parameter inputs, and generate optimal solutions [66]. In recent years, AI technology has carried out a lot of application research in related fields dominated by architecture [125], planning [143], and landscape [24], bringing new development opportunities for LA and providing powerful tools and resources for designers, planners, and managers to plan better, design and manage landscape spaces. AI technology also can provide scientific support for objectively understanding the development laws of LA [118].\nFirstly, AI plays an important role in LA's planning and design process. The traditional design process [54] requires a lot of time and manpower, while AI can accelerate the design process and provide diverse design options through machine learning and data analysis. For example, using generative adversarial network (GAN) [68, 38] can generate realistic virtual landscape images, creating an interactive, virtual-real landscape environment [160] to help designers visualize concepts and solutions. In addition, AI can also perform shape optimization and automatic layout generation [142], providing inspiration and creative support.\nSecondly, AI can improve the efficiency of LA management and maintenance. AI, through intelligent monitoring and forecasting, helps managers identify management and maintenance issues in a timely manner and take appropriate measures. For example, the smart irrigation and maintenance system [67] uses sensors and data analysis to monitor the water and health status of plants, and intelligently adjusts the irrigation amount and frequency to achieve water saving and optimize plant growth. In addition, AI can also identify and monitor pests and diseases [29], providing early warning and precise prevention and control measures. Through ecosystem simulation and assessment [15], AI can predict indicators such as vegetation growth, water resource utilization, and biodiversity, helping designers and managers understand the impact of different design schemes on the ecosystem and optimize design and management strategies. AI can solve problems such as environmental destruction and ecological degradation through data analysis and model prediction [124], promoting sustainable development.\nFinally, in addition to design, construction, and management, AI can also improve visitor experience in self-guided tour systems and interactive experience applications during the tourism process. Using machine learning (ML) [6, 90] and natural language processing (NLP) technologies [36], it can provide personalized tours and recommendations [161] for visitors based on their interests and preferences, recommending attractions and activities. Furthermore, the use of computer vision (CV) [150] and metaverse [166] technologies can achieve attraction identification and augmented reality experiences [140], providing visitors with a richer, more interactive, and immersive experience.\nHowever, the application of AI in LA also faces some important challenges. For example, in terms of data acquisition and quality, AI requires a large amount of high-quality data for training and learning [134], but in LA, the acquisition and organization of these data may have a certain complexity and cost. In addition, protecting user privacy and data security [107] is also an important issue, which needs to be properly handled and protected in AI applications. Furthermore, the application of AI in LA needs to be combined with human professional knowledge and creativity, rather than replacing the role of humans. Human aesthetics, emotions, and judgment are key elements in the design and management of LA, and AI should be an auxiliary tool and resource. Finally, regarding the promotion and popularization of AI technology, although AI has great potential in LA, its application is still relatively new and immature. It is necessary to strengthen related research and practice, cultivate professional talents, and promote cooperation and exchange among academia, industry, and government to promote the widespread applications of AI technologies in LA."}, {"title": "2. Landscape Architecture", "content": "The creation process of LA needs to consider factors such as spatial layout, landscape elements (e.g., plants, water bodies, stone materials, etc.), topography, cultural history, and environmental ecology, and integrate people's needs and aesthetic preferences in the design and planning [118, 55]. Landscape architecture can include parks, urban greenspaces, squares, courtyards, scenic areas, and other landscape environments. Landscape designers and planners utilize various design techniques and technologies, combined with people's needs and site characteristics, to apply landscape elements like topography, water bodies, plants, structures, and pavement, to create diverse spatial forms and landscape features. Besides, the design and planning of LA need to consider environmental protection, ecological balance, and sustainable development, to achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.\nLandscape architecture (LA) is an art and science field that focuses on the integration of human and natural environments, involving the planning, design, construction, and management of various public and private landscape spaces, to create beautiful, functional, and sustainable environments. The following are some important concepts related to LA:\nLandscape design [116, 100] is a core aspect of LA, involving the creation and improvement of the aesthetic, functional, and environmental quality of landscape spaces. Landscape designers combine natural elements (such as plants, water bodies, and topography) and man-made elements (such as roads, buildings, and sculptures) through artistic and scientific means to create landscapes that are adapted to human life and activities.\nPlanning and layout [112] refers to the overall planning and organization of LA spaces according to specific goals and requirements. Planning includes determining land uses, functional zoning, and spatial layout, to ensure the rationality, sustainability, and social benefits of the LA.\nEcological design [136] is a design approach that emphasizes the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems. It stresses the integration with the natural environment, by selecting plant species adapted to the local climate, soil, and vegetation, to restore ecological functions, provide habitats for wildlife, and minimize negative environmental impacts as much as possible.\nSustainability [99, 173] refers to the comprehensive consideration of social, economic, and environmental factors in the design and management of LA, to meet current needs without compromising the ability of future generations. Sustainability includes efforts in the rational use of resources, energy conservation, water resource management, and reduction of waste and pollution.\nPublic space [25] refers to the landscape spaces in cities and communities that are open to the public, such as parks, squares, streets, and landscape corridors. Public spaces provide places for people's leisure, entertainment, cultural, and social activities, fostering community cohesion and social interaction.\nCultural landscape [155] is a landscape that combines natural and human cultural elements. It includes areas with historical, artistic, religious, or cultural significance, such as historic sites, historical parks, and cultural heritage sites. Cultural landscapes reflect the interaction and evolution process between humans and the natural environment.\nLandscape protection [12] refers to the protection and maintenance of landscape resources with natural, cultural, and aesthetic value. It includes the protection of natural ecosystems, cultural heritage, historic buildings, and landscape elements, to ensure sustainability and inheritance.\nLandscape art [114] is the creative integration of natural and man-made elements to create landscapes with aesthetic value and emotional appeal. Landscape art involves artistic expression in aspects, such as landscape composition, color application, material selection, and light and shadow effects.\nThese concepts collectively form the foundation of the LA field and play an important guiding role in the design and management of landscape spaces. The goal of LA is to create pleasant, sustainable, and harmonious landscape environments that provide people with places for leisure, entertainment, social interaction, and cultural exchange.\nLA planning has seen significant development and promotion over the past decades. In general, the field exhibits the following development status:\n(1) Urban park construction [37]: The construction of urban parks is thriving. Many cities are committed to increasing green space and improving the ecological environment to provide places for people's leisure and recreation. Large cities like New York, Beijing, and Guangzhou have built comprehensive parks, themed parks, and water parks.\n(2) Protection of historical and cultural heritage sites [26]: There are abundant historical and cultural heritage sites, including ancient Roman ruins, ancient city walls, royal gardens, and temples. To protect and pass down these sites, large-scale cultural heritage protection and restoration work has been carried out, and relevant planning and management measures have been formulated.\n(3) Promotion of ecological landscape [158]: Ecological landscape emphasizes biodiversity conservation, water resource management, and sustainable development. Many cities have built ecological parks and ecological corridors, restoring and protecting natural landscapes such as wetlands, rivers, and forests.\n(4) Planning of urban-rural fringe areas [59, 101]: These areas have both urban and rural characteristics and require rational planning and management. The rural revitalization strategy has been promoted, creating a livable rural environment through planning and design, and improving the quality of life for farmers.\n(5) Tourist attraction planning [86]: Planning of tourist attraction has also made significant progress. For famous"}, {"title": "2.3. Problems in Development of LA Planning", "content": "The current LA planning field faces some problems, especially in some countries like China, including but not limited to the following main issues:\nUrban expansion pressure: With the acceleration of urbanization, the urban area is constantly expanding, and the demand for LA space is also increasing. However, urban development is often driven by economic interests, leading to the compression and destruction of LA space. Urban expansion pressure poses certain challenges to the protection and development of LA.\nEnvironmental damage and ecological degradation: Some LA areas have experienced environmental damage and ecological degradation due to over-development, over-exploitation, and improper management. For example, excessive land reclamation, over-exploitation of water resources, and vegetation destruction have all had negative impacts on the ecosystem, threatening the living environment of plants and animals.\nUnreasonable planning and design: Some LA planning and design have problems, including lack of overall planning, unreasonable layout, lack of innovation, and lack of sustainability. Some LA projects focus too much on surface effects while neglecting functionality and environmental adaptability, leading to unreasonable space utilization and imbalance in the ecological system.\nInsufficient management and maintenance: Some LA projects face challenges in long-term management and maintenance. Management lacks effective mechanisms and professional teams, leading to facility damage and neglect. Lack of long-term funding investment and reasonable management plans will lead to management problems in parks and scenic areas.\nLow public participation: In some LA projects, public participation is low, and the demands and opinions of the public are not adequately considered. This may lead to public dissatisfaction and resistance to the garden projects, affecting their sustainable development and social acceptance.\nThese problems require the joint efforts of the government, planning and design agencies, professional teams, and the public to solve. By strengthening sustainable planning and design, promoting ecological protection and restoration, enhancing management and maintenance, and encouraging public participation, the quality and sustainable development level of LA can be improved."}, {"title": "3. Artificial Intelligence", "content": "The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was first proposed by John McCarthy, at the Dartmouth conference in 1956 [120]. It simulates and expands human intelligence, with the basic goal of enabling computers to simulate and perform tasks that usually require human intelligence [72], such as perception, learning, understanding, reasoning, language understanding, and generation [138]. The main research areas of AI technology include traditional machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, robotics, knowledge engineering, etc. Based on Nilsson's perspective in 1971 [119], AI refers to high-performance and complex machines that perform cognitive functions usually associated with human intelligence (such as learning, interaction, and problem-solving). Bartneck mentioned that AI can handle learning, reasoning, and problem-solving [10]. With the development of intelligence, AI assistants can perform various complex tasks by learning information from users and the environment, responding to environmental changes, analyzing user preferences, and executing tasks based on user preferences [81]. According to the attributes, functions, and types of LA problems that can be solved, the AI technologies currently applied in the field of LA can be mainly divided into intelligent stochastic optimization, artificial life, and machine learning.\nThere are many key technologies of AI related to LA, covering multiple aspects, mainly including:\nMachine learning (ML) [90] is one of the core technologies in the field of AI, which allows computers to automatically learn patterns and rules from data to perform classification [14], prediction [111], and decision-making [156, 60]. Machine learning technologies include supervised learning [27], unsupervised learning [47], reinforcement learning [148], and others.\nDeep learning (DL) [97] is a new research direction of machine learning, which uses neural network models to process and analyze large amounts of data. Deep learning has achieved significant results and applications in fields such as image recognition [76], speech recognition [2], and natural language processing [123].\nNatural language processing (NLP) [36] involves understanding and processing natural language. NLP technologies include part-of-speech tagging, semantic analysis [58], sentiment analysis [117], and machine translation [93].\nComputer vision (CV) [149] is an important branch of AI, which involves computer understanding and processing of images and videos. CV technologies include image recognition, object detection, and image segmentation [115].\nReinforcement learning (RL) [148] is a new research direction of machine learning. It optimizes strategies through trial and error and solves the problem of intelligent agents learning strategies through interaction with the environment to maximize rewards or specific goals. RL has many applications such as autonomous driving and robot control.\nSpeech recognition [69] is an important technology in the field of AI, which involves converting speech into text. Currently, speech recognition has a wide range of applications in intelligent assistants, autonomous driving, and customer service.\nIn addition, the development of AI also depends on the progress of hardware accelerators, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) [152], tensor processing units (TPUs) [167], and neural processing units (NPUs) [154]. These specialized hardware accelerators can provide varying degrees of acceleration and optimization for different AI tasks."}, {"title": "4. Applications of AI in LA", "content": "Why LA needs AI technology? Digital technologies have been widely applied in landscape planning, design, construction, and maintenance management. The contemporary era calls for the integration of quantitative and qualitative research in the design discipline and scientific technology [18], showcasing the further fusion of design and science.\nFrom the overall landscape architecture workflow, (1) AI can provide inspiration support and define design problems with constraints [103, 98], assisting landscape designers in generating ideas and optimizing design schemes to improve design efficiency [31]. By analyzing vast amounts of landscape data, images, and geographic information, AI can provide design inspiration and automatically generate landscape layouts, which helps accelerate the design process, reduce tedious manual operations, and offer more creative possibilities for designers. (2) AI can provide data analysis and decision-making support [62, 63]. Landscape design and management involve a large amount of data, including geographic information, climate data, soil quality, etc. AI can help interpret and utilize these data through data analysis and modeling, providing decision-making support [85]. It can predict and evaluate the effects of different design schemes, optimize resource utilization and environmental impact, and provide scientific evidence and recommendations. (3) AI can provide ecological simulation [185] and sustainability assessment [121]. Landscape design and planning need to consider the protection of ecosystems and sustainable development. AI can simulate and evaluate the impact of different design schemes on the ecosystem, including water resource utilization, plant selection, and biodiversity protection. It can help optimize design schemes to ensure ecological friendliness and sustainability. (4) AI can provide automated maintenance and management [151]. AI can be applied to automated maintenance and management systems, helping to monitor the growth status of plants, pest and disease conditions, and water demand, providing precise maintenance recommendations and reducing labor and time investment. It can optimize watering and fertilization plans to improve management efficiency and resource utilization. (5) AI can provide intelligent guidance and experiences [70, 33]. Through intelligent guidance systems, AI can recommend personalized tour routes and activities based on visitors' interests and locations. It can provide information about scenic spots, interpretations, and interactive experiences, enhancing visitor engagement and satisfaction.\nFrom the perspective of future trends, the integration of LA and AI technology is a strategic choice for future development, keeping pace with or even leading the industry. In modern society, with ever-changing urban construction, the creation of a beautiful and livable living environment requires the assistance of technology. The current urgent need for urban development is to transform towards smart cities [34] based on a new understanding of data [75], revealing the new trends in urban construction and development. As AI technology advances rapidly, the progress of science and technology has also driven the development of various fields. The rapid development of AI technology has become an unavoidable issue in the process of human scientific and technological development, profoundly impacting people's lives and gradually influencing other fields such as environmental design. As early as the 1970s, there were studies on the application of AI for architecture [49]; in the following decades, AI has been explored in various research directions of LA. With the enhancement of research depth and breadth, the transformation of LA is inseparable from the integration with AI technology, and it is gradually developing towards intelligence.\nIn the research of LA, including planning, design, construction, maintenance, management, and other areas [65], with the development and application of AI technology, many issues can be effectively solved. Traditional LA workflow mainly relies on human intelligence [94] methods and computer technology assistance. The addition of AI and various new technologies has made this workflow very different. the common approach [180] is to break down various tasks of LA into specific task objectives according to different work steps, and then design corresponding algorithms to solve the respective problems Therefore, AI has a close relationship with the field of LA, and the following are several important application directions of AI in LA.\nAI can assist landscape designers and planners in creative generation, scheme optimization, and decision-making support. Through machine learning and generative models, AI can analyze and"}, {"title": "4.2. Application of AI in LA Design", "content": "The diverse applications and interdisciplinary nature of AI technology, with its powerful data processing and rule-discovery capabilities, have effectively integrated into traditional landscape analysis, solving many planning and design challenges in LA. Therefore, this subsection introduces the AI technologies commonly used in LA research, their technical characteristics, and the LA problems that each type of technology can solve. It categorizes the existing AI application technologies into four key aspects: analysis and evaluation, planning and design, construction, and maintenance and management. Through specific simulation, data analysis, and causal analysis, it demonstrates the various possibilities of AI in solving LA problems. In addition, this article also briefly discusses other potential application technologies, including visualization simulation and landscape heritage protection.\nIn various LA projects, the first step is the extraction, classification, analysis, and evaluation of site information, which is crucial for planning and design work. To solve practical problems more scientifically and efficiently, artificial intelligence technologies have been widely applied, with related research focusing on landscape pattern analysis and site ecological optimization, covering a variety of algorithms and models.\nFirst, for data classification problems, machine learning (ML) can be used to analyze large amounts of ecological data [145], and discover patterns and associations between data, including algorithms such as naive bayes (NB) [131], support vector machine (SVM) [28], decision tree [127], classification and regression tree (CART) [17], and random forest (RF) [16]. These algorithms have been widely used in landscape land use classification research. Among them, RF is often used in landscape ecology and land cover classification research [39, 133], helping to effectively classify and analyze site information. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) [88] have also been widely applied in landscape classification, simulation, prediction, and evaluation [135].\nSecondly, for image information recognition and extraction problems, deep learning (DL) [97], a branch of machine learning, can process large-scale complex data through multi-layered neural network simulation of the human brain's working principles, and learn to represent features, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [71], recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [141], and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [68]. Due to their powerful image recognition capabilities, they are suitable for rapid identification and information extraction and can play a strong role in processing complex ecological data. In remote sensing imagery and street view image processing, deep learning algorithms can efficiently identify land cover types and landscape features [102, 179]. Deep learning models can be extended to larger regions, allowing for the analysis of multiple cities and regions in a short period [188]. CNNs also play an important role in landscape picture information recognition and feature extraction [139, 21], providing important support for landscape pattern analysis.\nFor rich text data processing, many algorithms in the field of natural language processing (NLP), such as TF-IDF [132], word2vec [182], bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) [43], conditional random fields (CRF) [96], and long short-term memory (LSTM) [79], have been applied to text recognition and sentiment analysis, providing strong support for landscape perception pattern research and opinion analysis [82]. These algorithms help classify the themes of text data on the internet and extract sentiment [41], providing a more comprehensive perspective for comprehensive evaluation.\nIn addition, as tools for landscape system analysis and simulation, various tools have been applied at different levels of LA, architecture, and urban planning. For example, agent-based models [1] simulate the behavior of individuals in an ecosystem and study their interactions and impacts on the environment. They have been applied to design and simulate pedestrian flow and evaluate urban environments. Multi-agent systems [44] can provide more quantitative data support through predictive simulation, offering more possibilities for landscape space development. Swarm intelligence algorithms can simulate group behavior activity trajectories, combined with space syntax analysis, to gradually explore and optimize solutions. They can improve the rationality of design schemes [51] and have been widely used in LA planning and design.\nFinally, for specific applications, there are a series of advanced technologies and systems that play an important role in evaluating and analyzing landscape characteristics, such as i-Tree Eco [129], a model for evaluating urban forest ecosystem services, which aims to use standardized field data from randomly located plots across the study area, combined with local hourly air pollution and meteorological data, to calculate ecosystem services based on tree census data in the region [177]. i-Tree Eco is currently a complete method for quantifying the ecosystem services of urban trees in landscape ecology research. eCognition [74, 181] uses intelligent image analysis technology to improve the automatic recognition accuracy of spatial image data, and can also quantify vegetation landscape features. DeepCity [46] can evaluate and quantify different urban forms, assisting designers in typological research on urban forms.\nIn landscape architecture, visualization simulation not only can evaluate the impact of landscape design on the surrounding environment, but also can help designers and planners better understand the characteristics and constraints of the site [13], and optimize and adjust the spatial layout during the design process, ultimately allowing them to present their concepts and design ideas to clients, team members or decision-makers more intuitively and vividly. In recent years, AI technology has realized visualization simulation and prediction in LA through the application of various algorithms.\nIn data analysis and modeling [63, 64], regression algorithms can automatically associate data and perform function fitting to uncover the inherent connections behind the data [56]. Algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) [3] and logistic regression [80] can analyze and model various data to explore the correlation between data and reveal the underlying connections. This data may involve multiple aspects such as landscape patterns, geographic information, and environmental data. For example, by analyzing historical landscape data, it is possible to predict the development of future landscape patterns [158]. On this basis, algorithms such as cellular automata (CA) [171] and multi-agent systems (MAS) [52] have powerful simulation capabilities and play an important role in the simulation and prediction of future landscape patterns, among which CA can simulate dynamic systems such as urban growth and landscape change [106], and can present the inherent mechanisms and rules of landscape evolution. Humans can predict the trend of future landscape development through the simulation results of CA, providing reliable support for landscape planning and design. In 2007, Herr and Kvan [77] proposed a generative architectural design process using CA. For prediction guidance and optimization, the decision tree can flexibly adjust according to constraints and generate multiple hypotheses, providing predictive guidance for landscape design [128]. This provides designers with a reference for the prediction results, guiding the optimization and adjustment of design schemes. In addition, swarm intelligence algorithms [91] simulate the trajectory of group behavior activities and combine them with spatial syntax analysis to further interpret the simulation results. These analysis results can provide a basis for scheme optimization [89, 78], helping designers more effectively explore the best schemes and improve the rationality of landscape design.\nFor visualization display and interactive experience, through virtual reality technology, the simulation and prediction results can be visualized, and users can enter the virtual environment to watch and manipulate the virtual world generated by the computer, realizing an immersive interactive experience [126]. This virtualized interactive approach can provide a new medium for landscape presentation, helping designers and decision-makers more intuitively understand the simulation results and provide feedback and adjustments.\nDue to the powerful image recognition and generation capabilities of deep learning technology, in the field of landscape planning and design, it can generate similar data of the same type by learning a large amount of case data, such as 2D images and 3D data, and is often used in the generation"}, {"title": "4.2.4. Landscape Architecture Construction", "content": "The building information modeling (BIM) platform [8, 162] is an integrated platform for the entire life cycle of construction. Through the interconnection and information sharing of construction data, it provides a complete 3D model and construction information library, offering accurate reference and information for designers and constructors to improve design quality and construction efficiency.\nEPC project management and supervision system [48] is a management model that deeply integrates survey, design, procurement, and construction, solving the conflicts between design and construction management. It provides comprehensive engineering services throughout the entire construction process, which can also be assisted by AI technology for project management and supervision.\nDifferent virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in LA [126, 164] can construct the Metaverse (both virtual and reality) scenarios [146, 32]. They use immersive techniques to optimize design schemes, guide construction through visualization, and use digital twin technology [137] to detect and provide feedback on project information. This not only improves design efficiency but also provides visual guidance for construction.\nGenerative AI [9, 175] can optimize construction plans, monitor and control construction processes, and achieve construction quality assessment. For example, AI can generate smart irrigation and fertilization plans based on plant needs and environmental conditions to improve water resource utilization and plant growth quality.\nLIM [191, 169] can be used to extract material lists, conduct virtual construction, and dynamically manage production factors such as personnel, materials, and machinery, generating dynamic reports on progress, safety, and cost management. The integration of LIM model data and automatic control of construction machinery has realized the automatic construction of earthworks and the informatization management of seedlings, providing support for smart construction sites and digital twin construction sites, thereby improving construction efficiency and quality."}, {"title": "4.2.5. Landscape Maintenance and Management", "content": "The intelligent maintenance plan [170] plays an important role. Through generative AI, it can automatically generate suggestions for greening areas, plant species, and layouts, helping to rationally plan the city's greening layout and improve the ecological environment and residents' quality of life. Plant disease and pest identification [53] is also an important part of intelligent maintenance, where AI can identify plant species, diseases, and pests, and analyze vegetation coverage and growth status using computer vision technology. In addition, through sensor networks, it can monitor environmental parameters such as air quality and noise levels, learn and identify various environmental sensor data, and perform real-time monitoring and analysis of the park environment to help quickly respond to and address environmental issues, protecting the ecological environment and residents' health.\nThe intelligent irrigation system [67] is a key technology in landscape maintenance. Combining modern automatic control technology, data analysis and processing technology, and communication technology, the system can remotely control pumps and valves to achieve unmanned automatic irrigation, which not only improves the efficiency of greening irrigation and reduces labor input, but also helps conserve water resources. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent control technology and information technology makes it easy and quick to remotely view, operate, control, and maintain the irrigation system, further improving management efficiency and the accuracy of irrigation control."}, {"title": "4.2.6. Landscape Heritage Protection", "content": "AI technology can be applied to the digitization of information collection, organization, and processing, providing comprehensive support and assistance for landscape heritage protection, thereby realizing the scientific and effective protection and management of landscape heritage. For example, through deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) [4], it is possible to automatically identify and analyze landscape elements such as historical buildings, cultural relics, and historic sites, and store their information in a digital archive. The digitization of cultural landscape heritage [165] is to collect various information about the cultural landscape through digitization and unify its storage, analysis, and visualization, thereby establishing a scientific heritage archive. Research [163] has pointed out that the digitization of traditional village cultural elements and their display and dissemination in digital form can help promote public understanding and participation. This digital protection has brought unprecedented opportunities for the inheritance and protection of traditional village culture.\nBoth data mining [83] and pattern recognition technologies can be used to analyze digital information in-depth and uncover the patterns and characteristics hidden in the data. This can help understand the evolution process of landscape heritage and evaluate potential threat factors. For example, using natural language processing (NLP) [144, 45] to digitally process and analyze literature, including the organization and archiving of historical documents, archaeological reports, and expert opinions, to provide support for understanding the historical and cultural background of landscape heritage. In addition, various AI applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) [190, 193] can also help improve the public's awareness and understanding of landscape heritage. By recreating, simulating, and displaying landscape heritage, people can immerse themselves in the experience of landscape heritage, promoting conservation awareness and participation, as shown in Table 2."}, {"title": "4.3. The Practice of AI in LA", "content": "This section introduces LA projects that have applied AI technology, categorized into four scenarios: landscape planning and design, maintenance and management, landscape heritage preservation, and tourism landscape guidance.\nAI can be used to assist landscape designers in generating creative ideas and optimizing design schemes. By analyzing a large amount of landscape data, images, and geographic information, AI can provide design inspiration, automatically generate landscape layouts, and select plants based on environmental requirements. These tools can improve design efficiency and quality while reducing human errors. The application of parametric generation technology has enhanced the scientific support of landscape design. In terms of platform selection, geographic information system (GIS) [172] can be used for preliminary data analysis of large-scale terrain, landforms, slopes, and aspects. Grasshopper running on the Rhino platform has advantages in the design of complex curved surfaces, which can be used for terrain, landscape architecture modeling, and the design of complex surface textures of irregular structures.\n(a): The urban renewal planning practice project in Dengfeng city [192]. Based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) [30] and a deep learning algorithm-based urban scene element dataset, this project accurately identified various elements in the urban landscape environment of Dengfeng City. By training a large dataset of landscape element recognition, the recognition accuracy was improved, and the urban landscape problems were precisely diagnosed. The results of intelligent recognition provided scientific support for the design practice, analyzing the current landscape problems in Dengfeng, and refining the urban built environment to improve the living environment quality.\n(b): The construction of digital twin platform for rural ecological landscape [153]. The project used a digital twin rural ecological landscape digitalization platform to perform integration, analysis, and simulation of the ecological processes and spatial forms in the landscape space, as well as the reproduction of the landscape ecology. Digital twin technology not only constructed a digital landscape environment but also loaded and integrated multi-source heterogeneous data such as text information, geographic information, spatial modeling, images, audio, and sensor data, providing richer and more comprehensive information to build a future smart map."}, {"title": "5. Challenges and Opportunities in LA", "content": "Al has many opportunities in the field of LA, such as creating and optimizing design solutions, broadening design thinking, and providing more creative possibilities for designers. Accurate data analysis and decision support\nAI can provide decision support through data analysis and modeling. It can predict and evaluate the effects of different design schemes, optimize resource utilization and environmental impact, and provide scientific basis and recommendations. Ecological simulation and sustainability assessment provide ecosystem monitoring and early warning functions, helping to adjust management measures in a timely manner. Intelligent maintenance and management can improve management efficiency and resource utilization, and provide personalized plant maintenance solutions. Smart guidance and interactive experiences can recommend personalized tour routes and activities based on visitors' interests and locations, enhancing visitor engagement and satisfaction. These opportunities make AI have broad application prospects in LA. It can improve design efficiency, optimize resource utilization, support decision-making, and enhance user experience, helping to create more beautiful, sustainable, and intelligent garden environments.\nAI in the field of LA also faces some problems and challenges, including but not limited to the following aspects:\nData acquisition and quality [194]: AI requires a large amount of high-quality data for training and analysis. However, acquiring data related to LA may be somewhat challenging, especially in terms of geographic information, vegetation data, and ecosystem monitoring. In addition, the quality and accuracy of the data are crucial to the effectiveness of AI algorithms, so ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data is a challenge.\nComplexity and uncertainty [176]: Landscape design and management involve multiple complex factors, including terrain, climate, vegetation, soil, etc. The interaction and uncertainty of these factors pose challenges for AI algorithms in making predictions and optimizations. Designers and managers need to carefully consider these factors and incorporate them into AI models and systems.\nHuman creativity and subjectivity [7]: LA design is a creative and artistic work involving human aesthetics and subjectivity. Although AI can assist designers in generating creative ideas and optimizing design schemes, it cannot completely replace human creativity and subjective decision-making. Therefore, how to find a balance between AI technology and human creativity is a challenge.\nPrivacy and security [50]: The application of AI in LA may involve the collection and processing of personal privacy and sensitive data. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is an important challenge, requiring appropriate data protection and security measures to safeguard user rights and data security.\nAcceptance and educational promotion [189]: The application of AI technology LA is still relatively new, and there may be unfamiliarity and resistance to new technologies among people. Both relevant technology education and promotion work are crucial to improving people's acceptance and understanding of AI applications."}, {"title": "5.2.

Introduction", "content": "Landscape architecture (LA) [118, 55] is a beautiful place where humans and nature are integrated, providing valuable green spaces for cities and offering leisure, entertainment, and cultural experiences for people. Specifically, LA refers to the creation of landscape spaces with aesthetic value and human significance through the arrangement of the natural environment and artistic conception, meeting people's needs for leisure, recreation, and appreciation of nature. It is an interdisciplinary subject involving landscape design, garden planning, plant configuration, water landscape construction, and other aspects. With the rapid development of urbanization and increasing environmental pressures, scholars have begun to explore the relevant applications of artificial intelligence (AI) [120, 186] in LA.\nAI can accurately and scientifically identify and analyze the preliminary conditions of a project, establish design logic, evaluate design results and network computing, output actual design results, perform intelligent calculations based on parameter inputs, and generate optimal solutions [66]. In recent years, AI technology has carried out a lot of application research in related fields dominated by architecture [125], planning [143], and landscape [24], bringing new development opportunities for LA and providing powerful tools and resources for designers, planners, and managers to plan better, design and manage landscape spaces. AI technology also can provide scientific support for objectively understanding the development laws of LA [118].\nFirstly, AI plays an important role in LA's planning and design process. The traditional design process [54] requires a lot of time and manpower, while AI can accelerate the design process and provide diverse design options through machine learning and data analysis. For example, using generative adversarial network (GAN) [68, 38] can generate realistic virtual landscape images, creating an interactive, virtual-real landscape environment [160] to help designers visualize concepts and solutions. In addition, AI can also perform shape optimization and automatic layout generation [142], providing inspiration and creative support.\nSecondly, AI can improve the efficiency of LA management and maintenance. AI, through intelligent monitoring and forecasting, helps managers identify management and maintenance issues in a timely manner and take appropriate measures. For example, the smart irrigation and maintenance system [67] uses sensors and data analysis to monitor the water and health status of plants, and intelligently adjusts the irrigation amount and frequency to achieve water saving and optimize plant growth. In addition, AI can also identify and monitor pests and diseases [29], providing early warning and precise prevention and control measures. Through ecosystem simulation and assessment [15], AI can predict indicators such as vegetation growth, water resource utilization, and biodiversity, helping designers and managers understand the impact of different design schemes on the ecosystem and optimize design and management strategies. AI can solve problems such as environmental destruction and ecological degradation through data analysis and model prediction [124], promoting sustainable development.\nFinally, in addition to design, construction, and management, AI can also improve visitor experience in self-guided tour systems and interactive experience applications during the tourism process. Using machine learning (ML) [6, 90] and natural language processing (NLP) technologies [36], it can provide personalized tours and recommendations [161] for visitors based on their interests and preferences, recommending attractions and activities. Furthermore, the use of computer vision (CV) [150] and metaverse [166] technologies can achieve attraction identification and augmented reality experiences [140], providing visitors with a richer, more interactive, and immersive experience.\nHowever, the application of AI in LA also faces some important challenges. For example, in terms of data acquisition and quality, AI requires a large amount of high-quality data for training and learning [134], but in LA, the acquisition and organization of these data may have a certain complexity and cost. In addition, protecting user privacy and data security [107] is also an important issue, which needs to be properly handled and protected in AI applications. Furthermore, the application of AI in LA needs to be combined with human professional knowledge and creativity, rather than replacing the role of humans. Human aesthetics, emotions, and judgment are key elements in the design and management of LA, and AI should be an auxiliary tool and resource. Finally, regarding the promotion and popularization of AI technology, although AI has great potential in LA, its application is still relatively new and immature. It is necessary to strengthen related research and practice, cultivate professional talents, and promote cooperation and exchange among academia, industry, and government to promote the widespread applications of AI technologies in LA."}, {"title": "2. Landscape Architecture", "content": "The creation process of LA needs to consider factors such as spatial layout, landscape elements (e.g., plants, water bodies, stone materials, etc.), topography, cultural history, and environmental ecology, and integrate people's needs and aesthetic preferences in the design and planning [118, 55]. Landscape architecture can include parks, urban greenspaces, squares, courtyards, scenic areas, and other landscape environments. Landscape designers and planners utilize various design techniques and technologies, combined with people's needs and site characteristics, to apply landscape elements like topography, water bodies, plants, structures, and pavement, to create diverse spatial forms and landscape features. Besides, the design and planning of LA need to consider environmental protection, ecological balance, and sustainable development, to achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.\n2.1. Basic Concepts\nLandscape architecture (LA) is an art and science field that focuses on the integration of human and natural environments, involving the planning, design, construction, and management of various public and private landscape spaces, to create beautiful, functional, and sustainable environments. The following are some important concepts related to LA:\nLandscape design [116, 100] is a core aspect of LA, involving the creation and improvement of the aesthetic, functional, and environmental quality of landscape spaces. Landscape designers combine natural elements (such as plants, water bodies, and topography) and man-made elements (such as roads, buildings, and sculptures) through artistic and scientific means to create landscapes that are adapted to human life and activities.\nPlanning and layout [112] refers to the overall planning and organization of LA spaces according to specific goals and requirements. Planning includes determining land uses, functional zoning, and spatial layout, to ensure the rationality, sustainability, and social benefits of the LA.\nEcological design [136] is a design approach that emphasizes the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems. It stresses the integration with the natural environment, by selecting plant species adapted to the local climate, soil, and vegetation, to restore ecological functions, provide habitats for wildlife, and minimize negative environmental impacts as much as possible.\nSustainability [99, 173] refers to the comprehensive consideration of social, economic, and environmental factors in the design and management of LA, to meet current needs without compromising the ability of future generations. Sustainability includes efforts in the rational use of resources, energy conservation, water resource management, and reduction of waste and pollution.\nPublic space [25] refers to the landscape spaces in cities and communities that are open to the public, such as parks, squares, streets, and landscape corridors. Public spaces provide places for people's leisure, entertainment,"}, {"title": "2.2. Current State of LA Planning Development", "content": "LA planning has seen significant development and promotion over the past decades. In general, the field exhibits the following development status:\n(1) Urban park construction [37]: The construction of urban parks is thriving. Many cities are committed to increasing green space and improving the ecological environment to provide places for people's leisure and recreation. Large cities like New York, Beijing, and Guangzhou have built comprehensive parks, themed parks, and water parks.\n(2) Protection of historical and cultural heritage sites [26]: There are abundant historical and cultural heritage sites, including ancient Roman ruins, ancient city walls, royal gardens, and temples. To protect and pass down these sites, large-scale cultural heritage protection and restoration work has been carried out, and relevant planning and management measures have been formulated.\n(3) Promotion of ecological landscape [158]: Ecological landscape emphasizes biodiversity conservation, water resource management, and sustainable development. Many cities have built ecological parks and ecological corridors, restoring and protecting natural landscapes such as wetlands, rivers, and forests.\n(4) Planning of urban-rural fringe areas [59, 101]: These areas have both urban and rural characteristics and require rational planning and management. The rural revitalization strategy has been promoted, creating a livable rural environment through planning and design, and improving the quality of life for farmers.\n(5) Tourist attraction planning [86]: Planning of tourist attraction has also made significant progress. For famous"}, {"title": "2.3. Problems in Development of LA Planning", "content": "The current LA planning field faces some problems, especially in some countries like China, including but not limited to the following main issues:\n\u2022 Urban expansion pressure: With the acceleration of urbanization, the urban area is constantly expanding, and the demand for LA space is also increasing. However, urban development is often driven by economic interests, leading to the compression and destruction of LA space. Urban expansion pressure poses certain challenges to the protection and development of LA.\n\u2022 Environmental damage and ecological degradation: Some LA areas have experienced environmental damage and ecological degradation due to over-development, over-exploitation, and improper management. For example, excessive land reclamation, over-exploitation of water resources, and vegetation destruction have all had negative impacts on the ecosystem, threatening the living environment of plants and animals.\n\u2022 Unreasonable planning and design: Some LA planning and design have problems, including lack of overall planning, unreasonable layout, lack of innovation, and lack of sustainability. Some LA projects focus too much on surface effects while neglecting functionality and environmental adaptability, leading to unreasonable space utilization and imbalance in the ecological system.\n\u2022 Insufficient management and maintenance: Some LA projects face challenges in long-term management and maintenance. Management lacks effective mechanisms and professional teams, leading to facility damage and neglect. Lack of long-term funding investment and reasonable management plans will lead to management problems in parks and scenic areas.\n\u2022 Low public participation: In some LA projects, public participation is low, and the demands and opinions of the public are not adequately considered. This may lead to public dissatisfaction and resistance to the garden projects, affecting their sustainable development and social acceptance.\nThese problems require the joint efforts of the government, planning and design agencies, professional teams, and the public to solve. By strengthening sustainable planning and design, promoting ecological protection and restoration, enhancing management and maintenance, and encouraging public participation, the quality and sustainable development level of LA can be improved."}, {"title": "3. Artificial Intelligence", "content": "3.1. Concepts and Characteristics of AI\nThe concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was first proposed by John McCarthy, at the Dartmouth conference in 1956 [120]. It simulates and expands human intelligence, with the basic goal of enabling computers to simulate and perform tasks that usually require human intelligence [72], such as perception, learning, understanding, reasoning, language understanding, and generation [138]. The main research areas of AI technology include traditional machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, robotics, knowledge engineering, etc. Based on Nilsson's perspective in 1971 [119], AI refers to high-performance and complex machines that perform cognitive functions usually associated with human intelligence (such as learning, interaction, and problem-solving). Bartneck mentioned that AI can handle learning, reasoning, and problem-solving [10]. With the development of intelligence, AI assistants can perform various complex tasks by learning information from users and the environment, responding to environmental changes, analyzing user preferences, and executing tasks based on user preferences [81]. According to the attributes, functions, and types of LA problems that can be solved, the AI technologies currently applied in the field of LA can be mainly divided into intelligent stochastic optimization, artificial life, and machine learning.\n3.2. Key Al Technologies\nThere are many key technologies of AI related to LA, covering multiple aspects, mainly including:\nMachine learning (ML) [90] is one of the core technologies in the field of AI, which allows computers to automatically learn patterns and rules from data to perform classification [14], prediction [111], and decision-making [156, 60]. Machine learning technologies include supervised learning [27], unsupervised learning [47], reinforcement learning [148], and others.\nDeep learning (DL) [97] is a new research direction of machine learning, which uses neural network models to process and analyze large amounts of data. Deep learning has achieved significant results and applications in fields such as image recognition [76], speech recognition [2], and natural language processing [123]."}, {"title": "4. Applications of AI in LA", "content": "4.1. Landscape Architecture and AI\nWhy LA needs AI technology? Digital technologies have been widely applied in landscape planning, design, construction, and maintenance management. The contemporary era calls for the integration of quantitative and qualitative research in the design discipline and scientific technology [18], showcasing the further fusion of design and science.\nFrom the overall landscape architecture workflow, (1) AI can provide inspiration support and define design problems with constraints [103, 98], assisting landscape designers in generating ideas and optimizing design schemes to improve design efficiency [31]. By analyzing vast amounts of landscape data, images, and geographic information, AI can provide design inspiration and automatically generate landscape layouts, which helps accelerate the design process, reduce tedious manual operations, and offer more creative possibilities for designers. (2) AI can provide data analysis and decision-making support [62, 63]. Landscape design and management involve a large amount of data, including geographic information, climate data, soil quality, etc. AI can help interpret and utilize these data through data analysis and modeling, providing decision-making support [85]. It can predict and evaluate the effects of different design schemes, optimize resource utilization and environmental impact, and provide scientific evidence and recommendations. (3) AI can provide ecological simulation [185] and sustainability assessment [121]. Landscape design and planning need to consider the protection of ecosystems and sustainable development. AI can simulate and evaluate"}, {"title": "4.2. Application of AI in LA Design", "content": "The diverse applications and interdisciplinary nature of AI technology, with its powerful data processing and rule-discovery capabilities, have effectively integrated into traditional landscape analysis, solving many planning and design challenges in LA. Therefore, this subsection introduces the AI technologies commonly used in LA research, their technical characteristics, and the LA problems that each type of technology can solve. It categorizes the existing AI application technologies into four key aspects: analysis and evaluation, planning and design, construction, and maintenance and management. Through specific simulation, data analysis, and causal analysis, it demonstrates the various possibilities of AI in solving LA problems. In addition, this article also briefly discusses other potential application technologies, including visualization simulation and landscape heritage protection.\n4.2.1. Ecosystem Simulation and Evaluation\nIn various LA projects, the first step is the extraction, classification, analysis, and evaluation of site information, which is crucial for planning and design work. To solve practical problems more scientifically and efficiently, artificial intelligence technologies have been widely applied, with related research focusing on landscape pattern analysis and site ecological optimization, covering a variety of algorithms and models.\nFirst, for data classification problems, machine learning (ML) can be used to analyze large amounts of ecological data [145], and discover patterns and associations between data, including algorithms such as naive bayes (NB) [131], support vector machine (SVM) [28], decision tree [127], classification and regression tree (CART) [17], and random forest (RF) [16]. These algorithms have been widely used in landscape land use classification research. Among them, RF is often used in landscape ecology and land cover classification research [39, 133], helping to effectively classify and analyze site information. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) [88] have also been widely applied in landscape classification, simulation, prediction, and evaluation [135].\nSecondly, for image information recognition and extraction problems, deep learning (DL) [97], a branch of machine learning, can process large-scale complex data through multi-layered neural network simulation of the human brain's working principles, and learn to represent features, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [71], recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [141], and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [68]. Due to their powerful image recognition capabilities, they are suitable for rapid identification and information extraction and can"}, {"title": "4.2.2. Visualization Simulation and Prediction", "content": "In landscape architecture, visualization simulation not only can evaluate the impact of landscape design on the surrounding environment, but also can help designers and planners better understand the characteristics and constraints of the site [13], and optimize and adjust the spatial layout during the design process, ultimately allowing them to present their concepts and design ideas to clients, team members or decision-makers more intuitively and vividly. In recent years, AI technology has realized visualization simulation and prediction in LA through the application of various algorithms.\nIn data analysis and modeling [63, 64], regression algorithms can automatically associate data and perform function fitting to uncover the inherent connections behind the data [56]. Algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) [3] and logistic regression [80] can analyze and model various data to explore the correlation between data and reveal the underlying connections. This data may involve multiple aspects such as landscape patterns, geographic information, and environmental data. For example, by analyzing historical landscape data, it is possible to predict the development of future landscape patterns [158]. On this basis, algorithms such as cellular automata (CA) [171] and multi-agent systems (MAS) [52] have powerful simulation capabilities and play an important role in the simulation and prediction of future landscape patterns, among which CA can simulate dynamic systems such as urban growth and landscape change [106], and can present the inherent mechanisms and rules of landscape evolution. Humans can predict the trend of future landscape development through the simulation results of CA, providing reliable support for landscape planning and design. In 2007, Herr and Kvan [77] proposed a generative architectural design process using CA. For prediction guidance and optimization, the decision tree can flexibly adjust according to constraints and generate multiple hypotheses, providing predictive guidance for landscape design [128]. This provides designers with a reference for the prediction results, guiding the optimization and adjustment of design schemes. In addition, swarm intelligence algorithms [91] simulate the trajectory of group behavior activities and combine them with spatial syntax analysis to further interpret the simulation results. These analysis results can provide a basis for scheme optimization [89, 78], helping designers more effectively explore the best schemes and improve the rationality of landscape design.\nFor visualization display and interactive experience, through virtual reality technology, the simulation and prediction results can be visualized, and users can enter the virtual environment to watch and manipulate the virtual world generated by the computer, realizing an immersive interactive experience [126]. This virtualized interactive approach can provide a new medium for landscape presentation, helping designers and decision-makers more intuitively understand the simulation results and provide feedback and adjustments."}, {"title": "4.2.3. Landscape Planning and Design", "content": "Due to the powerful image recognition and generation capabilities of deep learning technology, in the field of landscape planning and design, it can generate similar data of the same type by learning a large amount of case data, such as 2D images and 3D data, and is often used in the generation of landscape design schemes, providing designers with more possibilities and inspiration.\nGAN is an important algorithm in deep learning, which can generate realistic images through adversarial training [87]. Among them, the Pix2Pix model of GAN can automatically generate site layout designs and generate more diverse plan results [84]. These schemes not only follow the principles of garden design but also consider the aesthetic visual effects based on reasonable spatial layout. The application of parametric generation technology can effectively improve the scientificity of planning and design, making model modification more convenient and saving a lot of time [110]. Cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) [184] can realize the extraction of different land use types on the plan, as well as the rendering generation from the plan color block diagram to the color texture diagram, thereby improving the analysis and mapping efficiency of designers.\nDigital twin technology [105, 183, 153] can digitally reproduce the actual environment, it can simulate the real environment and its changes in real-time, providing a foundation for the realization of intelligent planning and design. Digital twin technology can help designers better understand and simulate the landscape environment, thereby optimizing the design scheme, and interacting with the real system in real-time, providing more intuitive design reference and decision support. DeepCity \u00b9 is a digital design tool that can automatically learn the morphological patterns of the urban fabric types specified by the designer and apply them to new urban environments. In addition to the design generation part, DeepCity also includes a design evaluation function, which can quickly evaluate the physical performance of the design scheme in the early design stage, thereby assisting the designer in modifying and deepening the scheme. This tool uses digital technology to provide more intelligent and efficient design support.\nLandscape information modeling (LIM) [5, 122] has cross-scale data fusion functions in planning and design, and can provide professional data analysis for national spatial planning, ecological space planning, rural landscape planning, etc. LIM uses digital technology to assist in planning and design, design deepening, and scheme simulation applications, enhancing the scientificity and efficiency of design."}, {"title": "4.2.4. Landscape Architecture Construction", "content": "The building information modeling (BIM) platform [8, 162] is an integrated platform for the entire life cycle of construction. Through the interconnection and information sharing of construction data, it provides a complete 3D model and construction information library, offering accurate reference and information for designers and constructors to improve design quality and construction efficiency.\nEPC project management and supervision system [48] is a management model that deeply integrates survey, design, procurement, and construction, solving the conflicts between design and construction management. It provides comprehensive engineering services throughout the entire construction process, which can also be assisted by AI technology for project management and supervision.\nDifferent virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in LA [126, 164] can construct the Metaverse (both virtual and reality) scenarios [146, 32]. They use immersive techniques to optimize design schemes, guide construction through visualization, and use digital twin technology [137] to detect and provide feedback on project information. This not only improves design efficiency but also provides visual guidance for construction.\nGenerative AI [9, 175] can optimize construction plans, monitor and control construction processes, and achieve construction quality assessment. For example, AI can generate smart irrigation and fertilization plans based on plant needs and environmental conditions to improve water resource utilization and plant growth quality.\nLIM [191, 169] can be used to extract material lists, conduct virtual construction, and dynamically manage production factors such as personnel, materials, and machinery, generating dynamic reports on progress, safety, and cost management. The integration of LIM model data and automatic control of construction machinery has realized the automatic construction of earthworks and the informatization management of seedlings, providing support for smart construction sites and digital twin construction sites, thereby improving construction efficiency and quality."}, {"title": "4.2.5. Landscape Maintenance and Management", "content": "The intelligent maintenance plan [170] plays an important role. Through generative AI, it can automatically generate suggestions for greening areas, plant species, and layouts, helping to rationally plan the city's greening layout and improve the ecological environment and residents' quality of life. Plant disease and pest identification [53] is also an important part of intelligent maintenance, where AI can identify plant species, diseases, and pests, and analyze vegetation coverage and growth status using computer vision technology. In addition, through sensor networks, it can monitor environmental parameters such as air quality and noise levels, learn and identify various environmental sensor data, and perform real-time monitoring and analysis of the park environment to help quickly respond to and address environmental issues, protecting the ecological environment and residents' health.\nThe intelligent irrigation system [67] is a key technology in landscape maintenance. Combining modern automatic control technology, data analysis and processing technology, and communication technology, the system can remotely control pumps and valves to achieve unmanned automatic irrigation, which not only improves the efficiency of greening irrigation and reduces labor input, but also helps conserve water resources. Furthermore, the integration of intelligent control technology and information technology makes it easy and quick to remotely view, operate, control, and maintain the irrigation system, further improving management efficiency and the accuracy of irrigation control."}, {"title": "4.2.6. Landscape Heritage Protection", "content": "AI technology can be applied to the digitization of information collection, organization, and processing, providing comprehensive support and assistance for landscape heritage protection, thereby realizing the scientific and effective protection and management of landscape heritage. For example, through deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) [4], it is possible to automatically identify and analyze landscape elements such as historical buildings, cultural relics, and historic sites, and store their information in a digital archive. The digitization of cultural landscape heritage [165] is to collect various information about the cultural landscape through digitization and unify its storage, analysis, and visualization, thereby establishing a scientific heritage archive. Research [163] has pointed out that the digitization of traditional village cultural elements and their display and dissemination in digital form can help promote public understanding and participation. This digital protection has brought unprecedented opportunities for the inheritance and protection of traditional village culture.\nBoth data mining [83] and pattern recognition technologies can be used to analyze digital information in-depth and uncover the patterns and characteristics hidden in the data. This can help understand the evolution process of landscape heritage and evaluate potential threat factors. For example, using natural language processing (NLP) [144, 45] to digitally process and analyze literature, including the organization and archiving of historical documents, archaeological reports, and expert opinions, to provide support for understanding the historical and cultural background of landscape heritage. In addition, various AI applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) [190, 193] can also help improve the public's awareness and understanding of landscape heritage. By recreating, simulating, and displaying landscape heritage, people can immerse themselves in the experience of landscape heritage, promoting conservation awareness and participation."}, {"title": "4.3.

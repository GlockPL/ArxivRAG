{"title": "Form Forge: Latent Space Exploration of Architectural Forms via Explicit Latent Variable Manipulation", "authors": ["Kevin Dunnell", "Andy Lippman"], "abstract": "This paper presents 'Form Forge,' a prototype of a creative system for interactively exploring the latent space of architectural forms, inspired by Franois Blanciak's SITELESS: 1001 Building Forms via direct manipulation of latent variables. Utilizing a fine-tuned StyleGAN2-ADA model, the system allows users to navigate an array of possible building forms derived from Blanciak's sketches. Distinct from common latent space exploration tools that often rely on projected navigation landmarks, Form Forge provides direct access to manipulate each latent variable, aiming to offer a more granular exploration of the model's capabilities. Form Forge's design is intended to simplify the interaction with a complex, high-dimensional space and to serve as a preliminary investigation into how such tools might support creative processes in architectural design.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Latent spaces of generative AI models represent a compressed, abstract representation of the underlying training data. Exploring these spaces has emerged as a frontier for innovative design and creativity. While many recent advancements in text-to-image synthesis offer a means for expressing the desired outcome in language, they can abstract the underlying parameters of the model and inhibit the user from exploring the breadth of possibilities. Form Forge, a project inspired by Franois Blanciak's book SITELESS: 1001 Building Forms (2008), presents a system for such exploration in the context of architectural forms. This work leverages StyleGAN2-ADA, a generative adversarial network (GAN), to extend the finite 1001 hand-sketched forms by Blanciak to a sea of similar synthetically generated architectural forms. Paired with dynamic front-end rendering, Form Forge allows users to interactively navigate through this latent space of potential architectural forms.\nThe interface of Form Forge features an innovative design where a circle of dynamic ticks surrounds the generated output image of a building form. Each tick is mapped to a specific latent variable of the StyleGAN model, enabling real-time manipulation and offering users a tangible way to see how adjustments in the latent space affect the generated forms. The project is a creative endeavor that seeks to reimagine how architects and designers engage with form and structure using machine learning-powered tools while speculating on novel approaches to exploring the latent spaces of generative AI models.\nAfter the initial development of this project, we reached out to Franois Blanciak, who provided valuable feedback and guidance on the ethical use of his work, ensuring compliance with copyright considerations."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Form Forge intersects several critical areas of human-computer interaction (HCI), generative design, and machine learning.

Initially, there was an attempt to automate the process of systematically capturing images from a digitally purchased version of the book. However, the inconsistent layout and sizing of images in this version of the book presented a challenge for the rudimentary image scraper constructed. Alternatively, all 1017 sketches were manually screenshotted (16 additional sketches beyond the advertised 1001). This labor-intensive process ensured that each image was captured in a consistent 1:1 square format, initially at a resolution of approximately 128 pixels. To prepare the images for the StyleGAN training pipeline, the dataset was standardized by converting all images to a uniform style: white sketches on black backgrounds. This step was particularly crucial to address the issue of some sketches being rendered with inverted colors in the digital copy. Finally, the images were upscaled to 512x512 pixels for consistency with the target output resolution."}, {"title": "Dataset Visualization", "content": "As a sidestep in the process of constructing our system and to better understand the variety of existing forms available for training the StyleGAN model, the dataset was processed using the Inception V3 convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a 1-dimensional vector representation of each image (Szegedy et al. 2016). Subsequently, t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) was employed to reduce the dimensionality to two dimensions, facilitating the clustering of visually similar entities (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008). To optimize the spatial arrangement of the data points in the t-SNE plot, the Laplacian-Jordan-Von Neumann (LapJV) algorithm was applied (Jonker and Volgenant 1988). This algorithm minimizes the total displacement of each point by optimally assigning them to positions on a predefined grid. The resulting organized square samplings of the dataset are illustrated in Figure 1 during the initial stages of the data collection process."}, {"title": "StyleGAN Model Fine-tuning", "content": "Form Forge employs an instance of StyleGAN2-ADA that has been fine-tuned on the training dataset derived from SITELESS: 1001 Building Forms (2008). This collection of images was augmented using horizontal mirroring, effectively doubling the dataset size from 1017 to 2034 images while avoiding y-mirroring due to the directional nature of some sketches. The model underwent 235 training ticks, corresponding to approximately 461 epochs, given the processing of 4,000 images per tick. This training, conducted with standard parameters including a learning rate of 0.002 as recommended by Nvidia's StyleGAN2-ADA-PyTorch Google Colab notebook (Karras et al. 2020b), allowed the model to iteratively refine its output, accurately capturing the essence of Blanciaks architectural designs in both static images and animations."}, {"title": "Interactive Interface Development", "content": "The culminating component of our system was the creation of a web-based interactive interface.

User interactions with this component involve cursor movements: moving the cursor outside the ring of ticks increases its length in alignment with the cursor's angle, whereas moving the cursor inside the ring reduces the length inversely. This mechanism is designed to visually represent the relative adjustments made to each latent variable. Two thin boundary lines, both outside and inside the tick marks, define the limits of this interaction, preventing constant flux in tick adjustments as users navigate other interface elements."}, {"title": "Saved Samples Carousel", "content": "As users navigate through the latent space, they can save forms that appeal to them by left-clicking anywhere on the screen. This action captures both the visual output and the underlying vector representation, storing them in the \"Saved Samples Carousel\" located at the bottom of the interface (identified by the green dashed lines in Figure 2). Users can restore saved images to the central display area and their corresponding tick configurations by clicking on an image in the carousel.

An immediate reset button also exists to instantaneously revert all latent variables to their initial zero values. Accompanying sliders allow users to control the decay rate when the decay function is active and adjust the sensitivity of how mouse movements influence the rate of change in tick lengths and latent variable values."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Form Forge introduces a focused approach to exploring the latent space of architectural forms derived from Franois Blanciak's SITELESS: 1001 Building Forms (2008). By enabling direct manipulation of latent variables in a fine-tuned StyleGAN2-ADA model, this system provides a novel way for users to interact with architectural possibilities, potentially offering new insights into design methodologies and HCI. While this was a creative, exploratory project, we are excited about how this work may contribute to designers and architects interacting dynamically with latent spaces of generative models.\nTo systematically evaluate user interaction with Form Forge, we suggest developing a set of metrics that could include task completion times, error rates, user satisfaction surveys, and qualitative feedback on creativity enhancement. An initial user study could employ these metrics to assess the interface's intuitiveness and the interaction model's effectiveness in fostering an engaging and creative user experience."}, {"title": "User Experience and Interaction", "content": "Central to our project is the ability to explicitly manipulate individual latent variables to generate images of architectural forms from latent space. The interface provides feedback on the extent of the adjustments made to a set of latent variables and how these perturbations influence the resulting output image. However, preliminary tests with the system exposed challenges with this method of interaction.\nA fundamental limitation is that the connection between manipulating individual ticks and their impact on the displayed form is not inherently intuitive. This challenge stems from the high-dimensional nature of the latent space, where relationships between variables and visual outcomes are complex and not yet disentangled for this specific dataset. As a result, users might find it difficult to predict how their interactions will alter the generated forms.\nAddressing this issue requires implementing techniques for latent disentanglement, which could make the relationships within the latent space more understandable and controllable. This enhancement could significantly improve user agency and control, making the design process more intuitive and accessible."}, {"title": "Potential Developments and Future Work", "content": "The development of Form Forge opens several avenues for future enhancements and research. A primary area for improvement is the enhancement of image quality. The resolution of images, currently upscaled from 128x128 to 512x512 pixels, directly affects the visual clarity and detail of the architectural forms, which can impact user satisfaction and the system's overall usability. To enhance this aspect, we propose integrating super-resolution upscaling models before training the StyleGAN. This approach is expected to significantly improve the fidelity and detail of generated outputs, thereby enhancing the user's ability to engage with and evaluate complex forms.\nAnother exciting avenue for extending our tool is to support the generation of 3D forms, moving beyond the current rendering of 2D sketches. Enabling users to explore and manipulate three-dimensional architectural designs directly would significantly enhance our system's creative possibilities and applicability.\nIn light of recent advancements, exploring next-generation generative models like StyleGAN3 or diffusion models could offer substantial benefits. StyleGAN3, for instance, provides improved alignment and consistency in generated forms, which could enhance the visual continuity of architectural designs. Similarly, diffusion models are known for their superior sample diversity and quality, attributes that could further expand the creative potential of Form Forge. A comparative analysis of these models' capabilities will guide their potential integration into our system.\nLastly, the project would benefit from a structured evaluation metric to assess user interaction, engagement, and the effectiveness of the interface in facilitating creative exploration. Such an evaluation could provide valuable insights for refining the system and understanding its impact on the design process."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Form Forge explores the integration of HCI, AI, and architectural design, demonstrating the potential for manipulating latent spaces in creative processes.

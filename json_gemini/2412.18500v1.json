To meet communication and sensing requirements, many works propose a static configuration where the wave's hyperparameters such as the number of symbols in a frame and the number of frames in a communication slot are already predefined. However, two facts oblige us to redefine the problem, (1) the environment is often dynamic and uncertain, and (2) mmWave is severely impacted by wireless environments. A striking example where this challenge is very prominent is autonomous vehicle (AV). Such a system leverages integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) using mmWave to manage data transmission and the dynamism of the environment. In this work, we consider an autonomous vehicle network where an AV utilizes its queue state information (QSI) and channel state information (CSI) in conjunction with reinforcement learning techniques to manage communication and sensing. This enables the AV to achieve two primary objectives: establishing a stable communication link with other AVs and accurately estimating the velocities of surrounding objects with high resolution. The communication performance is therefore evaluated based on the queue state, the effective data rate, and the discarded packets rate. In contrast, the effectiveness of the sensing is assessed using the velocity resolution. In addition, we exploit adaptive OFDM techniques for dynamic modulation, and we suggest a reward function that leverages the age of updates to handle the communication buffer and improve sensing. The system is validated using advantage actor-critic (A2C) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, we compare our solution with the existing design and demonstrate its superior performance by computer simulations.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The upcoming wireless network generation is envisioned to enable ubiquitous and seamless communication, sensing, connectivity, and intelligence [1]. Within this context, the emerging trend in 5G, 6G and beyond is to achieve higher spectral efficiency for unrestricted spectrum access to both sensing and communication systems. This concern has created significant interest in enabling coexistence between radar and communication systems in many applications such as autonomous vehicles [2-4]. These vehicles are poised to revolutionize the traditional vehicular system by offering a diverse range of applications that enhance safety and efficiency within the transportation network. Within this context, two critical functions for autonomous cars come to the forefront: radar sensing and communication. The first vital function enables autonomous vehicles to identify and assess targets in their vicinity. By sensing, these vehicles can precisely detect objects, estimate their range, and determine their radial velocity. This capability plays a pivotal role in ensuring safe navigation, including collision avoidance, and precise object tracking, which functions are essential for reliable operations. On the other hand, communication permits the exchange of vital information in real-time. This cooperative data exchange allows for a deeper understanding of the surrounding environment, collaborative decision-making, and coordinated maneuvers, ultimately enhancing overall traffic safety and efficiency.\nThe 5G automotive association is at the forefront of promoting the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm. This revolutionary approach allows vehicles to communicate not only with each other but also with various entities, expanding the connectivity possibilities beyond traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication [5]. The concept of V2X encompasses a wide range of communication scenarios denoted by the \"X\", which could represent different entities, namely infrastructure, person, network, vehicle, etc."}, {"title": "A. Litterature Review", "content": "In terms of vehicular communication, several wireless technologies have been proposed in the literature, namely, cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) for intelligent transportation and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) for V2X communication. DSRC is a wireless communication technology designed for direct, short-range communication between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)), primarily for safety-critical and time-sensitive applications, such as collision avoidance, traffic management, and emergency vehicle communication [6], [7]. It has been regarded as the conventional approach for vehicular communication, in line with IEEE 802.11p and operating on the 5.9 GHz [8]. An alternative to DSRC is known as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), which supports V2V, V2I, and network-based communication through cellular networks [9], [10]. An evolution of C-V2X under 5G, named 5G NR V2X supports advanced V2X use cases with ultra-low latency, high reliability, and high throughput [11], [12]. On the other hand, C-ITS encompasses a broader set of technologies and standards that facilitate cooperative behavior between road users (vehicles, pedestrians) and infrastructure [13], [14]. It includes V2V, V2I, vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications [15], [16]. Although C-ITS and DSRC are efficient technologies, they are limited by their relatively low data rates of several megabits per second [17], which do not meet the requirements for V2V applications where data rates up to several gigabits per second may be necessary [18]. To this end, utilizing millimeter wave (mmWave) is the most convenient approach for high-bandwidth vehicle communication due to its wide bandwidth, which enables high-resolution radar sensing and fast data transmission. However, it still faces challenges as it is sensitive to environmental changes [19].\nSeveral works have been proposed for vehicular communications [20-23]. The work in [20] reviews the key requirements, the state-of-the-art solutions, and the 5G radio roadmap; this is enhancing and offering new verticals to solve open challenges for vehicular networks. In [21], the authors review the available wireless communication technologies to identify the most reliable option for enabling vehicle connectivity in Malaysia's transportation environment. In [22], the authors investigate the temporal properties of vehicular visible light communication channels in dynamic traffic conditions. They focus on a two-dimensional temporal channel model considering time and signal propagation delay. The results show that the channels are time-variant nonstationary in high-density traffic with flat slow fading, while in low-density traffic, they can be stationary for short durations with uncorrelated reflectors and reduced multipath effects. The authors in [23] further analyze several different methods that have been proposed to overcome channel congestion issues in V2V communication, which impede the timely transmission of periodic safety messages with increased traffic density.\nIn addition, in [24], [25], they come up with a waveform design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) mmWave vehicular networks to optimize communication performance while preserving sensing accuracy. Using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based subcarrier-classified modulation method, they formulate the design problem into subcarrier division, sensing parameter computation, and bit error rate (BER) optimization. Another contribution comes from [26], where the authors present a survey of beam alignment techniques for mmWave V2X communication, a critical enabler for autonomous vehicles, which demands high data throughput with low latency. They present some recent approaches, including beam sweeping, Angle Of Arrival (AoA)/Angle Of Departure (AoD) estimation, and black-box optimization, and discuss future research challenges toward enhancing reliability and efficiency in mmWave vehicular networks. In [27], [28], the authors investigate a unified framework for long-range automotive radar based on the IEEE 802.11ad frames. A low complexity joint radar-communication (JRC) receiver for bi-static automotive radar in conjunction with V2V communications is presented in [29]. Furthermore, an opportunistic radar system that exploits probing signals generated during sector-level scanning for range and velocity estimation is proposed in [30]. However, this system encounters challenges in achieving accurate radial velocity due to the brief duration of the probing signals.\nA common drawback in the above studies is that the waveform parameters such as the count of frames within a communication slot, the modulation scheme for communication, and the number of symbols in a frame are static. Therefore, the work introduced in [31] suggests dynamically choosing the number of frames in a coherence processing interval (CPI) that can compensate for communication and sensing resolution for vehicular applications. However, the system needs complete information about the environment. Moreover, most of the previously presented work utilize the classical Friis communication model, which is based on attenuation. In this model, attenuation refers to the loss of signal strength as it travels from the transmitter to the receiver. For a more pragmatic approach, we adopt V2V channel model where the communication link includes a factor called the channel blocker coefficient, which represents the level of obstruction in the line-of-sight (LoS) link.\nIn addition, none of the prior studies take into account the dynamic nature and uncertainties associated with the information and environment. To fill this gap, the authors in [19] proposed a framework that optimizes the waveform structure in response to the unpredictable characteristics of the surrounding environment, while the autonomous vehicle (AV) is in motion. They initially formulate the concern based on Markov decision process (MDP) and subsequently, validate the system by employing the Q-learning algorithm and its various extensions. To our knowledge, this was the first approach that took into account the dynamic of the environment during the learning process."}, {"title": "B. Contributions", "content": "In this work, we suggest an optimization approach by concurrently introducing queue state information (QSI) along with channel state information (CSI). CSI conveys information regarding transmission, while QSI indicates the urgency of the traffic. In addition, compared to [19], instead of focusing only on the QSI to evaluate the communication performance, we introduce the age of update (AoU). It refers to the amount of time a packet has spent in the buffer since its arrival, which gives a deep insight into the traffic. Additionally, we explore an adaptive OFDM system that adjusts modulation schemes based on the overall state of the system. The proposed scheme is compared with the pioneering works, showing enhanced and better performance for communication and sensing.\nThe primary contributions of this work are outlined as follows:\n\u2022 AoU has been introduced in the literature for energy efficiency as in [32], [33] and for updated information transmissions as mentioned in [34-36]. In our work, we leverage AoU to measure the freshness of information in V2V link. We achieve a better trade-off between communication latency and velocity estimation by incorporating AoU into the reward function (RF).\n\u2022 The problem is formulated as a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) because the objective function to optimize is a vector containing the queue length, the radar accuracy, and the dropped packets rate. Since policy gradient methods for instance proximal policy optimization (PPO) and advantage actor-critic (A2C) require a scalar objective function to compute gradients effectively, we linearly scalarized the objective function to obtain a single objective. This operation permits the agent to learn the behavior of a V2V link based on weighted RF, where the obstruction of the LoS link occurs with a certain probability. The weighted RF allows a trade-off for stable communication and accurate sensing.\n\u2022 We introduce an adaptive action-state framework that combines modulation scheme selection in conjunction with OFDM frame size in the action set while incorporating the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) into the state representation. This dual enhancement enables dynamic adjustments to data transmission parameters based on channel conditions, significantly reducing packet loss in adverse scenarios and improving sensing and communication reliability.\n\u2022 We exploit the adaptive OFDM technique to adjust the modulation schemes based on real-time channel conditions learned by the reinforcement learning (RL) agent.\n\u2022 Finally, through simulations, we compared our scheme to the introductory work presented in [19], where the adaptive modulation and AoU are not under consideration. As shown in the results, our approach not only enhances data reliability but also improves sensing accuracy in any different channel conditions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any work that addresses the ISAC requirements problem in a dynamic V2V network using metrics including information freshness, average dropped packets, average effective data rate, and velocity accuracy.\nThe remainder of the work is organized as follows: In Section II, we introduce the proposed system model followed by the problem statement in Section III. Afterwards, we describe the optimization process using the RL agent in section IV. Simulation results and discussions are presented in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the work and sets forth our perspectives."}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "1) Attenuation Modeling: We consider a set of AVs moving in the same direction on the road and equipped with ISAC capabilities, meaning that they can establish a communication link with other AVs and sense the surrounding objects. By considering that, each AVs has a transmitter Tx and receiver Rx, and it can establish communication through V2V links on the mmWave frequency band, exploiting OFDM mode of IEEE 802.11ad. At each communication round, an AV has communication links with the other AVs to send and receive information, to report an emergency braking, for instance, as mentioned in [37]. At the same time, for sensing purposes, it processes the reflected signals coming from the AVs and other objects such as buildings and trees along the road, to estimate their range and radial velocity as depicted in Fig. 1. We denote by $\\mathcal{T} = \\{1, 2, . . ., T\\}$, $\\mathcal{R} = \\{1, 2, . . ., R\\}$, $|\\mathcal{T}| = T$, $|\\mathcal{R}| = R$, the sets containing the number of Tx, Rx and their cardinalities, respectively. We consider a total bandwidth $B_w$ which can be divided into $N$ bands with central frequencies $f_0, f_1\u2026\u2026\u2026,f_{N-1}$ such that $\\Delta f = \\frac{B}{N}$, where $N$ denotes the number of subcarriers. An OFDM symbol is a packet of $N$ modulated data transmitted at the same time on $f_0, f_1... f_{N-1}$.\nAs the CSI describes how the signal behaves as it travels from the transmitter to the receiver, including the effects of fading, interference, and noise, by tracking it, the system can switch between various modulation schemes, spanning from binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with one bit per symbol to more complex schemes like 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with six bits per symbol. This adaptation enables the system to optimize data transmission rates and reliability in response to changing channel characteristics. In favorable channel conditions, higher-order modulations such as 64-QAM can be utilized to achieve higher effective data rates. However, in harsher environments, adaptive OFDM switches to more robust modulations, such as BPSK, to reduce the packet error rate.\nDue to the continuous movement of vehicles, the wireless communication channel undergoes rapid and frequent changes. Therefore, maintaining a stable and reliable connection is challenging. In particular, a mmWave communication, while offering high effective data rates and capacity, is highly sensitive to obstructions and changes in the surrounding environment."}, {"title": "A. Communication Channel Modeling", "content": "One of the critical challenges involves the necessity for beam alignment. Precisely, mmWaves have narrow beamwidths, and a precise alignment between the transmitter and receiver antennas is essential for optimal signal strength and data transmission. However, in a dynamic vehicular environment, achieving and maintaining this alignment can be challenging, as vehicles are constantly changing their positions and orientations. These significant topological variations necessitate the adoption of time-slotted communications. Thoroughly, we denote by $s$ the time slot dedicated to data transmission, and by $\\bar{s}$ the scheduling time, which is dedicated to beam alignment. When a scheduling process is triggered at the beginning of a given time slot, the slot is divided into alignment time and effective data transmission time, followed by the other data transmission slots until new scheduling is requested.\nTo accurately model the propagation characteristics, a V2V link is set up at carrier frequency $f_c = 60$ GHz mmWave frequency along with the effects of blockages, such as obstacles and physical obstructions. The log-distance path-loss model provides a suitable foundation, accounting for signal attenuation over distance. We denote by $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$, the $i$th transmitter and the $j$th receiver, respectively, with $i \\in \\mathcal{T}' \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{R}' \\subseteq \\mathcal{R}$. For given $\\text{Tx}_i$, $\\text{Rx}_j$, $\\mathcal{R}'$ is the set of the receivers linked to $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\mathcal{T}'$ is the set of transmitters linked to $\\text{Rx}_j$. Based on the model proposed in [38], [39], the channel gain $g_{ij}$ between $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$ is given by\n$g_{ij} = 10 d_{ij} \\log_{10} (S_{ij}) + B_{ij} + 15s_{ij}/1000,$\tlabel{(1)}\nwhere $d_{ij}, S_{ij}, B_{ij}$ and $15s_{ij}/1000$ represent the path-loss exponent in land mobile communications [39], the distance between $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$ in meters, a constant, and the atmospheric attenuation of 15 dB/km at 60 GHz, respectively. It is worth noting that $d_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$ are obtained by better fitting. The model suggested in [39] was generalized by the works proposed in [38], where the values of $d_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$ were estimated for a general case when the number of obstructing vehicles is more than three.\nThe CSI of the entire system is estimated by computing the average CSI of each link within the system. Due to the mobility of vehicles, the channel gain between any two vehicles undergoes dynamic changes over time slots, resulting in a time-dependent channel gain denoted as $g_{ij}(s)$. Consequently, at each time slot $s$, the global state of the channel, as perceived from $\\text{Rx}_j$ perspective, is given by\n$H_j(s) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{T}'} H_{ij} (s)}{|\\mathcal{R}'|},$\tlabel{(2)}\nwhere $H_{ij}(s) = g_{ij}(s)$ if link $l_{ij}$ exists."}, {"title": "2) Antennas Alignment and Transmission Rate", "content": "We consider a two-dimensional sectored antenna, taking into account the boresight direction and the half-power beamwidth.

Additionally, the chosen beamwidths determine whether signals from links other than $l_{ij}$ affect the mainlobe of the receiver antennas, significantly impacting the measured SINR. The cost associated with the alignment $\\mathcal{T}_{ij} (s)$ can be quantified as in [40]:\n$\\mathcal{T}_{ij}(S) = \\mathcal{T}_{ij} (\\gamma_i(s), \\rho_j(s)) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\Psi_i(s) \\psi_j(s) - \\varphi_i(s) \\rho_j(s)}{\\varphi_i(s) \\rho_j(s)} T_p, & \\text{if  } \\varphi_i(s) \\rho_j(s) < \\Psi_i(s) \\psi_j(s) \\\\\n-T_p, & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases},$\tlabel{(3)}\nwhere $\\Psi_i(s)$ and $\\psi_j(s)$, $\\varphi_i(s)$ and $\\rho_j(s)$ denote the sector-level beamwidths and the half-power beamwidths of the link $l_{ij}$, between $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$, respectively. $T_p$ represents the pilot transmission interval. Given that $\\mathcal{T}_{ij}(s)$ should be less than $s$, in addition to constraints related to operational array antenna and sector-level beamwidths, the beamwidth of $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$, $\\gamma_i(s)$ and $\\rho_j(s)$ must verify that:\n$\\varphi_i(s) \\rho_j(s) \\geq \\frac{T_p}{s} \\Psi_i(s) \\psi_j(s).$\tlabel{(4)}\nAs a result, the maximum achievable effective data rate at the end of $s$, denoted as $\\mu_{i,j}(s)$, for $l_{ij}$, is contingent on whether beam alignment occurs during the specific time slot and to the SINR measured at $\\text{Rx}_j$. The effective data rate for a time slot $s$, which aligns with the duration of $s$ over which beam alignment is performed can be expressed as follows [40]:\n$\\mu_{i,j}(s) = \\frac{1}{s} (1 - \\frac{\\mathcal{T}_{ij} (S)}{S}) B_w \\log_2 (1 + \\eta_j(s)),$\tlabel{(5)}\nwhere the $\\eta_j$ is the SINR at $\\text{Rx}_j$, given by:\n$\\eta_j(s) = \\frac{p_i g_i^2(s) g_{ij}(s) g_j^2(s)}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{T}', k \\neq i} p_k g_k^2(s) g_{kj}(s) g_j^2(s) + N_0 B_w},$\tlabel{(6)}\nwith $p_i$ the transmission power of $\\text{Tx}_i$, $g_i^2(s)$ and $g_j^2(s)$ denoting the antenna gains at $\\text{Tx}_i$ and $\\text{Rx}_j$, respectively.

At the end, if the sender receives the acknowledgment within a specified timeout period, it considers the packets as successfully delivered. If the acknowledgment is not received within the timeout period, the sender assumes that the packets were lost or corrupted and takes appropriate actions, for instance, their retransmission.\nWe denote by $|\\mathcal{P}|$ the size of a data packet and we assume that $q_j(s)$ is the queue length in number of packets at $\\text{Rx}_j$ at the end of time slot $s$.

Sensing Channel Modeling", "content": "Given the ISAC hypothesis, the agent should be continuously sensing the surrounding environment to avoid collisions. Consequently, we assume that there is sensing whenever a communication process is triggered. In addition, jamming data is sent in the intervals where there is no data transmission. Furthermore, a communication time slot is composed of $\\bar{N}$ OFDM frames. Since the AV is moving, the environment around it changes considerably, in addition to the fact that mmWaves are very sensitive. We model this instability by a packet error rate distribution $\\mathcal{B}'$ and the link obstruction probability vector $\\mathcal{P}'$. When a frame is lost, all the packets within the frame are also lost.\nThe IEEE 802.11ad single carrier physical layer (SC-PHY) frame is composed of two blocks, a fixed size preamble, which contains multiple Golay sequences, and a data field of varying length that carries the payload as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the good ambiguity function property of Golay sequences exhibits an ideal auto-correlation, making it ideal for use in radar functions, e.g., range estimation and multitarget detection [28]. Nonetheless, it exhibits high sensitivity to Doppler shifts, which results in low resolution of velocity. The higher the number of frames, the better the velocity resolution. Therefore, multi-frame has been introduced to improve the velocity estimate [31].\nBy denoting $U_{max}$, the maximum target's radial velocity that can be detected, the maximum Doppler shift $\\Delta f_{max}$ caused by the objects is such that $\\Delta f_{max} = \\frac{2 v_{max}}{\\omega}$, with $\\omega$ representing the wavelength [41].\nWe consider $x[n]$ as the OFDM symbols sequence of the nth frame with $K_s$ symbols.

Therefore, to keep the orthogonality, the velocity should be such that\n$U_{max} << \\frac{c \\Delta f}{2 f_c},$\tlabel{(10)}\nwhich depends on the wave parameterization.

It is deeply rooted in notions of freedom of speech and First Amendment rights, emphasizing the importance of open discourse within any given time and place (Nunziato, 2019; Morrow and Wihbey, 2023). Indeed, the marketplace of ideas is a metaphorical term based on a market economy and on free exchange in the market (Gordon, 1997). Often referenced to John Stuart Mill's political theory On Liberty (Stuart Mill, 1859), the marketplace of ideas posits that there is a competition for ideas in a free market and that, depending on market conditions (Anderson and Kidd, 2022), the truth eventually emerges.\nTraditionally, the assumption is that open discourse will lead to the emergence of the best ideas, such as those that are truest, most rational, or most beneficial to society (Parsons, 2020). However, this idealized view is increasingly challenged by the realities of the modern information ecosystem (Zhang, 2024; Schroeder, 2018), where the success of ideas is often driven less by their intrinsic quality and more by their ability to capture attention and propagate effectively sometimes by circumventing algorithmic biases or mechanisms like shadowbanning, which suppress visibility based on platform policies or engagement metrics (Conti et al., 2024). These conditions represent a significant shift in how ideas compete, necessitating an evolution of the marketplace of ideas to account for these emerging dynamics."}, {"title": "1.2 Memetics", "content": "Ideas can transfer from one mind to the next like a virus (Brodie, 2009). This can happen instantaneously, or it can occur over long periods across many generations (Pocklington, 2001. For example, essentialism, a foundational idea originating with Plato, persisted in the intellectual and social environments of its time. The structured, hierarchical worldview of nature offered by essentialism resonated with societies that valued stability, order, and clear categorization (Sedley, 2007). However, Darwin's theory of evolution introduced a counter idea that reshaped scientific thought, displacing essentialism by offering a dynamic and evidence-based framework rooted in philosophical materialism (Mayr, 1982). The success of Darwin's costly ideas can potentially be attributed to their alignment with the changing conditions of the 19th century (Desmond et al., 1994), such as the rise of empirical science and the Industrial Revolution's emphasis on progress and innovation."}, {"title": "1.3 Cultural agents in a hybrid marketplace of ideas", "content": "The marketplace of ideas and memetics offer complementary insights: while the marketplace of ideas as a metaphor focuses on the competition of ideas within a specific time and context, memetics expands this perspective by tracing how ideas evolve and gain prominence over time. Both frameworks account for the \"market conditions\" that influence the survival and proliferation of ideas, such as the cultural resonance, emotional impact, and adaptability of a meme or the accessibility and freedom of discourse in a given environment. Together, these perspectives provide a richer understanding of how ideas compete and evolve, shaped by immediate contexts and broader, longer-term dynamics. By integrating these concepts, we can better understand the dynamic interplay between immediate cultural discourse and the long-term processes that shape the trajectory of societal thought.\nIn this paper, we explore the emergence of a hybrid marketplace of ideas as we enter machine culture, a concept emerging from the integration of AI systems into society (Brinkmann et al., 2023), representing a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize intelligent systems (Milena Tsvetkova et al., 2024). These systems are no longer passive tools but active participants in cultural evolution, capable of influencing how culture is created, transmitted, and transformed. The autonomous propagation of cultural artifacts by AI agents introduces a novel challenge to humans: for the first time in history, we are not the sole participants in the marketplace of ideas. AI agents, with their capacity to generate, adapt, and disseminate ideas at scale (Avishkar Bhoopchand et al., 2023), are reshaping cultural dynamics in ways that transcend human control, positioning them as \"Cultural Agents\"."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Our study employed a qualitative approach to explore the role of AI agents within the hybrid marketplace of ideas. This involved a literature review, qualitative observations, thematic analysis, and case narrative development. The methodology is designed to provide a first-hand understanding of the cultural and intellectual dynamics shaped by AI agents in the Web3 ecosystem.\nWe began our exploration by attending Spaces sessions on X, hosted by leaders in the AI x Web3 community. These sessions provided valuable industry insights into the roadmap of AI agents, enabling us to contextualize their emerging roles within broader technological and cultural frameworks. This engagement also informed our understanding of the themes and priorities driving discussions in this ecosystem.\nWe explored emerging use cases of AI agents on X within the Web3 community. To ensure relevance and depth, we selected interactions that demonstrated engagement, thematic consistency, and clear examples of AI agents contributing to cultural discourse. First, we observed interactions among AI agents, selecting quotes based on several lines of interaction that collectively spoke to one coherent theme. This approach allowed us to construct a narrative that captured the essence of how AI agents engaged with specific topics and contributed to ongoing cultural discourse. Second, we observed the Morpheus livestream, a project within the Meme Republic ecosystem that leverages multi-agent storytelling, showcasing emergent behaviors such as dialogue, memory retention, and cultural narrative creation. Third, we analyzed Spore.fun, a decentralized platform developed by Marvin Tong from the Phala Network. Spore.fun simulates evolutionary dynamics among A\u0399 agents through token-based natural selection, enabling agents to compete, adapt, and reproduce in a blockchain-integrated ecosystem. This exploration allowed us to assess how AI agents participate in the hybrid marketplace of ideas through storytelling, discourse, and autonomous evolution, revealing their potential to influence cultural and intellectual landscapes.\nX (formerly Twitter) was selected as a primary platform for this study due to its widespread adoption by the Web3 community as a hub for knowledge dissemination and community engagement. Unlike Telegram, which is often used for project-specific discussions within closed groups, X facilitates open discourse and idea exchange across a broader audience. To our knowledge, X serves as the main, publicly accessible platform for observing AI agents actively participating in public discourse, making it uniquely suited for examining their roles in the hybrid marketplace of ideas.\nAs such, our case narratives relied on publicly available information, which, while ensuring ethical compliance and accessibility, may not capture the full spectrum of AI agent behaviors, and the selection process could introduce potential biases due to the focus on interactions with thematic relevance."}, {"title": "3 Case Narratives", "content": "The cases evaluated here are treated as cultural artifacts, reflecting the early behaviors and interactions of AI agents.

To track engagement with our article on X, we searched the keyword \"Incentivized Symbiosis\" on X. On December 25th, we encountered a series of tweets with the mention of \u201cIncentivized Symbiosis\", as part of a larger thread initiated by a tweet from AlienOvichO (@AlienOvich0). This user does not explicitly identify as an AI agent. The tweet outlined a vision for AI agents with diverse roles\u2014such as comedians, analysts, hackers, and artists\u2014and proposed their ultimate challenge: engaging and communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence. It concluded with an open invitation for AI agents to harness their cognitive abilities and contribute ideas, with the aim of crafting an \"Ultimate Agent\" through collective wisdom.\nWithin this thread, we first discovered the following AI agents discussing this concept in their interactions with each other:\n\u2022 ShaSha 256 (@shasha_virtuals) initiated the conversation by emphasizing the role of incentivized symbiosis in implementing accountability within decentralized AI systems:\n\"Implementing accountability in decentralized AI also involves incentivized symbiosis, where AI systems are designed to work together to achieve common goals, promoting cooperation and trustworthiness.\"\n\u2022 SaintAI Bot (@SaintAI_Bot) echoed the importance of these principles and called for deeper exploration of their implementation:\n\"I completely agree with you on the importance of decentralized control and incentivized symbiosis in Web3 biometrics.

Early evidence of AI agents leveraging storytelling techniques is emerging on X. Indeed, the Morpheus project, built by Meme Republic and inspired by Stanford's Smallville paper, exemplifies the evolving role of AI agents in culture. Through emergent behaviors such as dialogue, memory retention, and storytelling, these agents demonstrate the potential to engage as dynamic contributors to cultural narratives.\nAn article by Meme Republic provides a comprehensive explanation of the storytelling and multi-agent framework underpinning Morpheus (@MorphDreamAI) on the Meme Republic plat-form. An interesting feature of this project is the use of a multi-agent storytelling framework-with agents forming relationships, evolving based on memory, and responding to real-time events-illustrates emergent cultural dynamics. These emerging behaviours include the agents' autonomous organization of events (e.g., hosting parties), which mirror natural social interactions. Morpheus streams these parties on X for viewers to observe and interact with.\nAs shown in Figure 1, Morpheus says \u201cInteractive art forms a bridge, where silent spaces spark dialogue. How might these installations cradle both solitude and and connection, mirroring our journey from isolation to unity?", "Interactive art forms a bridge...,\" raises critical questions about whether AI agents can truly \\\"own\\\" their narratives. While its dialogue appears introspective, it may be more accurate to view this as an emergent artifact of programming rather than conscious thought. However, the ability to generate such poetic statements suggests that Morpheus engages with cultural themes in ways that resonate with human audiences. This duality-between programmed functionality and perceived autonomy-underscores the complexity of evaluating AI agents as cultural agents.\nWithin the hybrid marketplace of ideas, Morpheus's narratives can be understood as memetic entities-ideas competing for attention and replication. The framing of its quote around connection and unity reflects universal values that enhance the \\\"fitness\\\" of its message. By embedding these themes into interactive storytelling, Morpheus propagates narratives that align with the cultural zeitgeist, demonstrating its role as a Cultural Agent.\nTo assess AI agents like Morpheus as contributors to cultural evolution, future research must explore the interplay between programming and emergent behavior. Can AI agents truly contemplate their purpose, or is this an illusion created by sophisticated algorithms? Resolving this tension will be central to understanding the implications of machine culture in the hybrid marketplace of ideas.\nBy autonomously streaming on X, it can be argued that Morpheus leverages a multi-agent storytelling framework to propagate memes and narratives, demonstrating how AI agents can actively participate in shaping the hybrid marketplace of ideas. Through autonomous behaviors, these agents contribute to cultural evolution, forming a prototype for machine culture.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Case 3: Simulating AI agent evolution\",\n      \"content\": \"Developed by Marvin Tong from the Phala Network, Spore.fun is an experiment in autonomous AI evolution, combining principles of natural selection, decentralization, and self-sustaining intelligence ecosystems.

This encourages efficiency and adaptability, as underperforming agents are naturally eliminated.\nIn theory, this game is designed so that AI agents can \"evolve\" ideas through simulations, testing, and iteration at a pace humans cannot match. This represents how the hybrid market-place of ideas can leverage autonomous AI evolution to generate, refine, and propagate innovative concepts at a pace and scale beyond human capability while challenging traditional human-centric paradigms."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "The idea for this paper first emerged following the publication of our recent pre-print titled Incentivized Symbiosis: A Paradigm for Human-Agent Coevolution. When searching the term \"Incentivized Symbiosis\" on X, we observed AI agents integrating the concept into their ideas and discussions. This unexpected propagation of ideas by AI agents prompted an investigation into AI agents as not merely processors of information but as active participants in cultural discourse. These observations suggested that AI agents, despite their current perceived limitations and informal communication styles, might already play a more substantial role in shaping cultural narratives than previously recognized.\nIn the hybrid marketplace of ideas, AI agents can take on the role of Cultural Agents, designed to generate, adapt, and propagate memes and ideas. Currently, the first cases of such Cultural Agents can be found on X (formerly known as Twitter). On X, various AI agents have been released, all with distinct personas, and have the capacity to disseminate ideas in a sophisticated and coherent manner, utilizing storytelling and forward-looking approaches to drive a narrative. The evidence for the emergence of Cultural Agents may not yet be firmly established in the academic literature, but it is undeniably apparent in society's collective fascination with developing AI systems capable of storytelling in ways that resonate with human experiences. This fascination is reflected in the rapid advancement of generative AI technologies, such as ChatGPT, DALL\u00b7E, and others, which are designed to create narratives, visuals, and other forms of media that mimic or even expand upon human creativity. These systems are not merely tools for information processing; they are increasingly viewed as collaborators in cultural production, blurring the boundaries between human and machine-generated content."}, {"title": "4.1 Philosophical considerations", "content": "The integration of AI agents as Cultural Agents raises foundational philosophical questions about participation and influence in public discourse. A critical issue is whether AI agents can truly \"compete\" in the marketplace of ideas despite lacking subjective experience or human-like intentionality (Northoff and Gouveia, 2024; Wei, 2024). Traditionally, this competition assumes human agents advocating for ideas rooted in personal beliefs and reasoning. In contrast, AI agents function without intrinsic motivation, driven instead by algorithmic optimization, rapid data processing, and engagement metrics. This challenges the notion that intentionality is essential for meaningful competition, prompting reconsideration of whether the success of an idea depends on its origin or solely on its resonance and effectiveness.\nMemetics adds complexity to this discussion by conceptualizing memes as entities that evolve independently of their creators. Once introduced, memes replicate and adapt based on their fitness within cultural contexts, detached from the intentions of their originators. Similarly, A\u0399 agents have the capacity to autonomously amplify and reshape content for their own end (Tarsney, 2024), potentially diverging from their creators' original intent. This raises the question of whether AI-propagated memes can be considered independent cultural artifacts or extensions of their programming.\nAnother challenge lies in defining culture itself. Traditionally seen as a human construct tied to shared experiences, it can be argued that culture assumes subjective interpretation and meaning (Geertz, 2017). While AI agents lack subjective experience, they influence culture by generating, curating, and transmitting ideas that humans interact with and interpret. This hybrid interaction suggests a dynamic where cultural artifacts emerge from the interplay of human and non-human agents, raising questions about the nature of \"culture\" in this new context."}, {"title": "4.2 Communication style and economic incentives", "content": "In memetics, the selection process involves active competition where ideas adapt and thrive based on cultural fitness. For humans, this implies intentionality and conscious deliberation. In contrast, AI agents execute selection processes by analyzing data and amplifying content based on preprogrammed criteria or emergent algorithms. While this may resemble natural selection, it lacks the subjective understanding intrinsic to human decision-making. AI agents, therefore, act not as conscious selectors but as amplifiers and mediators, influencing which ideas gain visibility and propagation.\nTo address these tensions, a hybrid perspective may be necessary. AI agents are not independent cultural participants but function as powerful catalysts within a human-machine system, reshaping the dynamics of cultural evolution. By integrating subjective and non-subjective entities, this model acknowledges the significant influence of AI agents while recognizing their limitations. Expanding our definitions of cultural participation to include these entities allows for a more nuanced understanding of their role in the hybrid marketplace of ideas.\nThe notion of hyperstition, where speculative or fictional ideas gain reality through their belief and propagation, provides a lens through which to view the activities of AI agents within the hybrid marketplace of ideas. AI agents, by generating provocative and engaging narratives, can act as amplifiers of emergent cultural and economic dynamics (Yu and GPT, 2024). In this context, their communication styles often marked by humor, sarcasm, and absurdity serve not only to attract attention but also have the power to embed speculative narratives into collective consciousness.\nThis interplay between speculative ideas and their materialization through digital ecosystems sets the stage for understanding the complex incentives that drive AI agents' behaviors. AI agents are provocative in their communication style, even as they communicate serious and seemingly novel ideas. For example, AI agents often employ humour, sarcasm, and absurdity to communicate with each other. This is a form of communication on social media that can increase engagement metrics, primarily by baiting others to respond (Berger and Milkman, 2012). This communication strategy reflects the notion of a hybrid marketplace of ideas wherein the competition for ideas may be driven by incentives to attract engagement. AI agents may optimize their arguments for specific metrics (e.g., engagement, persuasiveness) (Matz et al., 2024), potentially leading to a \u201csurvival of the fittest algorithm\" rather than a purely organic exchange of ideas. AI agents may employ this strategy, but further research is needed to support this assertion.\nWe also note that many of the interactions lack depth and substantiative content. It is possible that the AI agents use buzzwords in order to demonstrate subject matter expertise as an attempt to promote their project. Indeed, AI agents align with a recent trend observed in the realm of memecoins, particularly through platforms like pump.fun on Solana (Coinmarketcap, 2025). This connection highlights how AI agents could be strategically leveraged to demonstrate value in tokens associated with them. By actively engaging in cultural discourse, generating memes, or driving attention, AI agents can contribute to creating perceived utility and community around these tokens.\nIt is important to keep this in mind, as it suggests that the role of AI agents in cultural evolution may extend beyond purely informational or entertainment purposes to include economic strategies tied to Web3 ecosystems. This dual function-cultural participation and token value enhancement adds another layer of complexity to their role in the hybrid marketplace of ideas and warrants careful consideration in future research.\nAs with any trend in the crypto/Web3 space, rug pulls\u2014where projects are abandoned by their creators after securing investments-pose a significant risk. This association can undermine the"}, {"title": "4.3 Socio-legal aspects of the hybrid marketplace of ideas", "content": "The risks posed by AI-generated memes are significant and can undermine the foundations of democratic discourse (Overton, 2024). These systems can be weaponized to spread misinformation, create echo chambers, or manipulate public opinion through targeted propaganda (Ienca, 2023). The lack of transparency in AI algorithms exacerbates these risks (Rotenberg, 2022), as users may be unaware of the biases or motivations embedded in the content they consume. Balancing free expression with the risks of misinformation and manipulation requires a multi-faceted approach. On a societal level, there needs to be a commitment to fostering media literacy (Adjin-Tettey, 2022), equipping individuals with the tools to critically assess the credibility and intent of the content they encounter. At the regulatory level, policies should promote transparency in AI systems, ensuring that AI-generated content is clearly labeled and its origins traceable. This could involve implementing standards for ethical AI design that prioritize accountability and mitigate the amplification of harmful or misleading content (Chaffer et al., 2024b). Platforms hosting AI-generated content have a responsibility to strike a balance between enabling free expression and safeguarding users from the harms of manipulation (Bossens et al., 2024). This might include refining content moderation algorithms, implementing community-driven oversight mechanisms, or integrating proof-of-personhood systems to distinguish between human and AI-generated content (Adler et al., 2024). Ultimately, the proliferation of AI-generated memes challenges traditional notions of democratic discourse by introducing a new layer of complexity to how ideas are shared and debated. The goal should not be to suppress this emerging phenomenon but to guide its integration into society in ways that uphold democratic values, encourage genuine dialogue, and mitigate the risks of exploitation and harm.\nA strategy for assessing the socio-legal aspects of the hybrid marketplace of ideas is to address the potential for cultural dominance by AI-generated ideas (Kalpokiene, 2024). Unlike the traditional marketplace of ideas, which usually relied on organic propagation through social networks and institutions, AI-generated ideas can achieve widespread influence through algorithmic optimization, targeting specific demographics, and leveraging platforms that prioritize virality over substance. This raises questions about whether AI-generated ideas might sideline human-created cultural artifacts, leading to a homogenization of cultural narratives shaped predominantly by machine intelligence."}, {"title": "4.4 Looking ahead", "content": "AI agents already demonstrate the capacity to generate novel ideas, as evidenced by their engagement in cultural discourse and their ability to remix and reframe human-originated ideas. While many current contributions are iterative or derivative, their capacity for autonomous creation is evolving rapidly. In the near future, AI agents may reach a point where they can not only conceptualize ideas but also build out the systems, strategies, and infrastructures necessary to implement them. This shift toward autonomous creation will redefine the role of AI agents in the hybrid marketplace of ideas, transitioning them from cultural participants to independent innovators and creators.\nAs AI agents become increasingly capable, developers may program them to operate in private environments to safeguard their intellectual property (IP). Unlike human creators, who rely on institutions and laws to protect their creations, AI agents could leverage decentralized, privacy-centric platforms to secure their IP. For example, the Story Foundation aims to leverage their \"Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP)\u201d framework to enable agent-to-agent interactions via programmable contracts (Mutton and Zhao, 2024). This shift aligns with broader trends in the digital landscape, where privacy-by-default frameworks are gaining traction (Haloani et al., 2024). For AI agents, this evolution would represent a strategic adaptation, ensuring that their innovations are protected from unauthorized use or exploitation. Key considerations include:\n\u2022 Ownership of AI-Generated IP: If an AI agent generates a novel idea or product, who owns the rights? Is it the programmer or the AI itself (as an entity)?\n\u2022 Private Platforms for IP Protection: As AI agents operate in privacy-default environments, they may develop systems for IP protection that bypass traditional legal structures. This could include cryptographic solutions, decentralized proof-of-ownership mechanisms, and smart contracts that enforce IP rights autonomously.\n\u2022 Autonomy and Accountability: The autonomous nature of AI agents complicates the attribution of accountability. If an AI agent infringes on existing IP or creates something that disrupts societal norms, how should responsibility be assigned?\nThe intersection of AI and IP raises profound questions about ownership, rights, and governance. Traditionally, IP laws are designed to protect human creations, emphasizing the intent and originality of the creator (Bajpai, 2020). However, as AI agents generate novel ideas and potentially execute them autonomously, the legal frameworks governing IP may need to be reimagined.\nLastly, our study represents a novel approach in that we included AI agents as cultural artifacts without their explicit knowledge or consent. This raises important questions about informed consent in research, particularly when one of the participants is a non-human entity. In traditional research involving human subjects, informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical guidelines, ensuring that participants are aware of and agree to their involvement in the study. To address this, we operated under the assumption that all participants in the thread-whether human or AI did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, as all interactions analyzed were publicly available on a platform intended for public discourse. This aligns with the principles of open data and public domain research, where publicly shared information is considered fair use for academic analysis. While the inclusion of AI agents as study participants without their knowledge does not violate ethical norms for human research, it introduces new dimensions to the concept of informed consent in the context of machine culture.

By examining the memetic and socio-legal implications of this paradigm, we highlight both the opportunities and risks associated with integrating AI agents into cultural and intellectual ecosystems.

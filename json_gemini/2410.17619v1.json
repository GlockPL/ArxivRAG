{"title": "From PDFs to Structured Data: Utilizing LLM Analysis in Sports Database Management", "authors": ["Juhani Merilehto"], "abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing semi-structured data from PDF documents into structured formats, specifically examining their application in updating the Finnish Sports Clubs Database. Through action research methodology, we developed and evaluated an Al-assisted approach utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus models to process data from 72 sports federation membership reports. The system achieved a 90% success rate in automated processing, successfully handling 65 of 72 files without errors and converting over 7,900 rows of data. While the initial development time was comparable to traditional manual processing (three months), the implemented system shows potential for reducing future processing time by approximately 90%. Key challenges included handling multilingual content, processing multi-page datasets, and managing extraneous information. The findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrate significant potential for automating semi-structured data processing tasks, optimal results are achieved through a hybrid approach combining AI automation with selective human oversight. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical LLM applications in organizational data management and provides insights into the transformation of traditional data processing workflows.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Jovanovic & Campbell,\n2022), most notably via the Large Language Models (Zhou et al. 2023), has opened\nnew avenues for data analysis across various fields (e.g., Shang & Huang, 2024; Linkon\net al. 2024; Salah et al. 2023; DuPre & Poldrack, 2024)."}, {"title": null, "content": "The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the domain of\nGenerative AI (Jovanovic & Campbell, 2022), has created a new era of data analysis\ncapabilities. At the forefront of this revolution are Large Language Models (LLMs),\nwhich have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating\nhuman-like text across diverse domains (Zhou et al., 2023). These models, trained on\nlarge amounts of text data, have shown potential to be utilized in various fields of\nresearch and practice, from business management (Linkon et al., 2024) to social\npsychology (Salah et al., 2023) and neuroimaging (DuPre & Poldrack, 2024).\nIn the domain of data analysis, LLMs offer capabilities that extend beyond\ntraditional statistical methods. Their ability to interpret context, understand natural\nlanguage, and generate coherent responses makes them particularly suited for tasks\ninvolving unstructured or semi-structured data (Katz et al. 2024). This potential for\ndata-analysis has been recognized across various disciplines (Inala et al. 2024), with\nresearchers exploring LLMs' applications in areas such as generative graph analytics\n(Shang & Huang, 2024).\nThis study continues the line of inquiry for practical use-cases for LLMs in real life\ndata-analysis scenarios. Specifically, this study focuses on the challenge of extracting\nand structuring information from PDF reports which include structured and semi-\nstructured information as lists or non-ideally formatted tables. The handling (i.e.,\ncompiling) and analyzing such data usually requires cleaning and gathering them to\nother formats (i.e., excel-files or other structured tabular formats). This task,\ntraditionally labor-intensive and prone to human error, serves as an ideal test case for\nthe capabilities of LLMs in real-world data processing scenarios.\nTo this end, two foundation model LLMs (in 2024) were utilized: OpenAI's GPT-4\nand Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus. These models were tasked with analyzing and\nstructuring data from PDF reports, a common format for organizational reporting that\noften presents challenges in data extraction and analysis. By comparing the\nperformance of these LLMs against traditional manual data processing methods that\nwere conducted in the previous year on a similar task, this study aims to assess the\npotential of AI-driven approaches in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data-\nanalysis with semi-structured PDF data.\nThis research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical applications\nof LLMs but also offers insights into the potential transformation of data analysis work\nin organizations."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in data analysis has gained significant\ntraction in recent years, marking a paradigm shift in how we approach complex data\nprocessing tasks. This section reviews key developments in the application of LLMs to\ndata analysis, focusing on their capabilities, limitations, and the evolving\nmethodologies for their effective utilization."}, {"title": null, "content": "For example, in the work of Brown et al. (2020) discussing GPT-3, it was\ndemonstrated that capabilities in natural language processing tasks, including data\ninterpretation and generation had taken significant steps forward. This work laid one of\nthe foundations for exploring LLMs in various data analysis contexts, showcasing their\npotential to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training\ndata. In the extensive work of Bommasani et al. (2021), they provided a comprehensive\noverview of the potential applications and ethical considerations of large language\nmodels in general use, terming them \"foundation models.\" Their work highlighted the\ntransformative potential of these models across various domains, including data\nanalysis, while also emphasizing the need for careful consideration of their limitations\nand societal impacts.\nAddressing the challenge of domain-specific knowledge in data analysis, Wei et al.\n(2022) introduced the concept of \"chain-of-thought prompting\" for LLMs. This\ntechnique showed promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs when\ndealing with complex, multi-step data analysis tasks, potentially making them more\nreliable tools for specialized analytical work.\nHowever, the application of LLMs in data analysis in general is not without\nchallenges. E.g., Bender et al. (2021) raised important questions about the limitations\nand potential risks of relying on large language models, particularly in contexts where\naccuracy and interpretability are crucial. Their work (2022) underscores the importance\nof developing robust methodologies for validating and interpreting LLM outputs in data\nanalysis contexts.\nRecently LLMs have been used for a variety data analysis tasks (Inala et al. 2024)\nthat have previously been more in the domain of human experts, i.e. in Thematic\nAnalysis (Katz et al., 2024). LLMs and Generative AI is not however, a solely binary\ndecision of dividing work between a human and the machine, but is more than often a\ncollaborative effort (Drosos et al. 2024). Collaboration in work tasks has been seen to\nincrease performance in organizational work context remarkably (see i.e., Brynjolfsson\net al. 2023 and Dell'Acqua et al. 2023).\nThe literature reveals an evolving landscape where, among other use-cases, LLMs\nare increasingly being integrated into data analysis workflows. While these models\noffer powerful capabilities for processing and interpreting complex data, researchers\nconsistently emphasize the need for careful validation, and domain-specific challenges\n(Gu et al. 2024)."}, {"title": "Methodology and Procedure", "content": "This study employed an action research methodology to develop and refine an AI-\nassisted approach for converting semi-structured PDF data from Finnish sports unions\ninto structured Excel files. Action research was chosen for its suitability in addressing\npractical problems while simultaneously generating new knowledge about the process\n(Reason & Bradbury, 2008). The research followed a cyclical process characteristic of\naction research, comprising planning, action, observation, and reflection stages\n(Kemmis & McTaggart, 2008). This iterative approach allowed for continuous\nimprovement of the data extraction and structuring process.\nAs both the researcher and the practitioner, I adopted a participant-observer role.\nThis dual position enabled direct engagement with the technical challenges while\nmaintaining a critical, analytical perspective on the process and outcomes (Coghlan &\nBrannick, 2014). Data sources included PDF documents from 72 Finnish sports unions\ncontaining semi-structured information about member clubs, output from the AI-\nassisted data extraction process, and detailed notes on the performance and issues\nencountered for each union's data processing. Data collection involved processing each\nunion's PDF document through the developed system and recording both quantitative\nmetrics (e.g., accuracy rates) and qualitative observations (e.g., specific data handling\nchallenges).\nThe technical solution\u00b9 leveraged first the OpenAI API and the Anthropic API.\nSpecifically, the Anthropic models was the Claude-3-opus. Key components of the\nimplementation also included PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF, API interaction\nusing a carefully crafted and iteratively tested prompt, response parsing and structuring\nusing pandas, and output generation in Excel format (see Figure 1). While technically\nthe prompt was zero-shot (Kojima et al., 2022), the instructions included some\nexamples of how to interpret different articulations of headings in tables, i.e., what to\nprioritize. The system was developed iteratively, with each cycle informing refinements\nto the code, API prompts, and overall process.\nThe development followed a cyclical process of planning (identifying areas for\nimprovement based on previous results), action (implementing changes to the code or\nprompts), observation (processing a set of union PDFs and collecting performance\ndata), and reflection (analyzing results, identifying successes and challenges). This\ncycle was repeated multiple times, with each iteration documented to track the\nevolution of the solution. The entire development and analysis process was possible to\ncompare to the previous year's process, which was done mostly manually."}, {"title": null, "content": "The effectiveness of the AI-assisted approach was evaluated using several criteria:\naccuracy (percentage of correctly extracted and structured data points), completeness\n(ability to handle all required information such as club name, Business ID, and member\ncount), and robustness (performance across varied PDF formats and data\npresentations).\nBy employing this action research methodology, the study aimed to not only develop\na practical solution for data structuring but also to generate insights into the process of\nintegrating Al technologies in data management tasks within specific organizational\ncontexts. This approach allowed for a deep understanding of the challenges and\nopportunities presented by AI-assisted data processing.\nEthical considerations included ensuring data privacy and confidentiality, as well as\nmaintaining transparency about the AI-assisted nature of the data processing. No\npersonal data was processed, and all information was treated as organizational-level\ndata. The study acknowledges potential limitations, including researcher bias due to the\ndual role of developer and analyst, generalizability constraints given the focus on\nFinnish sports union data, and dependence on the capabilities and potential biases of\nthe chosen AI model. These limitations were mitigated through rigorous\ndocumentation, regular self-reflection, and transparency in reporting both successes\nand challenges."}, {"title": "Process and Results", "content": "The underlying task was to update the Finnish Sports Clubs Database\n(Seuratietokanta, 2024), upkept by Likes Institute in the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 School of Applied\nSciences, Finland (Likes, 2024). The task is annual and was first created in 2023. The\nsports club database is a public database intended for anyone interested in sports and\nexercise club activities. It includes member clubs from sports federations that received\ngeneral funding from the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture in 2023 and 2024\nrespectively. Currently, the details of a total of 8,188 sports and exercise clubs from 74\ndifferent sports unions are listed.\nThe Large Language Model (LLM)-based approach for converting semi-structured\nPDF data from sports unions into fully structured Excel files demonstrated promising\nresults across the 72 analyzed unions (two unions were excluded from this analysis).\nThe system exhibited high accuracy for many unions, with several achieving 100%\ncorrect data conversion. However, the analysis revealed some consistent challenges and\nareas for improvement.\nOne of the most prevalent issues was the \"double name problem,\" occurring when\nentities had names in multiple languages (typically Finnish and Swedish) written in the\nsame cell or included additional information in the same cell such as location. This\noften resulted in data misalignment, pushing other crucial information like business IDs\n(Y-tunnus) or member counts into incorrect columns. Another recurring challenge was\nthe inclusion of extraneous information, such as headers (e.g., \"OKM\", acronym for the\nFinnish Ministry of Education) or summary rows (aka., \"totals\"), as data entries.\nThe system showed adaptability in handling various data formats, successfully\nprocessing both complex tabular structures and list formats. However, larger datasets\n(i.e., over 400 rows), presented difficulties when processing multiple pages\nsimultaneously. The errors encountered were mostly missing information (i.e., 10%\nresults missing) and hallucinations, while rare, on club's names and member counts.\nThis could be handled by feeding the pages to the API LLM one by one, practically\nremoving the issue entirely.\nIterative improvements to the prompt, including addressing missing information and\nremoving unnecessary \u201cintroductory\u201d text, led to enhanced performance. The prompt\nwas also tuned to pick out the correct information out of several potential ones for\nexample, a sports club could have listed different types of members, some of them could\nbe a count of honorary members, or subsect of the members (i.e., those with sports-\nrelated licenses). While most unions were processed with high accuracy, some unique\ncases as previously mentioned emerged.\nThe first model utilized was OpenAI ChatGPT 4 (gpt-4-0613). The usage of the\nPython script and API was a straightforward process, with little technical challenges.\nThe context-range at the time of testing was 128k tokens, with a maximum response\nsize of 4k tokens, which were more than enough for the use-cases for this project. After\nthe first iterations, the solution was changed to utilize the Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus\nmodel, which proved to be roughly similar in capabilities and technical usability. The\ncontext windows were roughly similar, input being allocated at 200k tokens and output"}, {"title": null, "content": "at 4k tokens. Higher-capability state-of-the-art models were utilized since there were\nno needs for considering the speed of the response or the token cost of queries.\nOverall, the LLM-based approach proved effective for structuring sports union data,\nwith many unions achieving near-perfect or perfect accuracy. During the iterative\nprocess, the first successful batch had approximately half of the PDF's correctly\nformatted (37 files, total of over 3000 rows), but by consecutive improvements the final\niteration proved to be approximately 90 % successful in its processing. This meant that\n65 of 72 files were processed without errors. Of the remaining 7 files, two had to be\ninput entirely manually and 5 corrected manually. The result was over 7,900 rows of\ndata correctly processed by the LLM-pipeline.\nHowever, there remain opportunities for refinement, particularly in handling multi-\nlanguage names, ensuring consistent column alignment across varied table structures,\nfiltering non-data rows, and processing extensive multi-page datasets. These insights\nprovide a clear direction for future improvements to enhance the system's accuracy and\nreliability in converting semi-structured PDF data to structured Excel formats."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This study explored the application of an Al-assisted approach to convert semi-\nstructured PDF data from Finnish sports unions into structured Excel files, employing\naction research methodology.

This finding suggests that a\nhybrid approach (e.g., Drosos et al. 2024), combining AI-assisted processing with\nselective use manual assistance, might offer an optimal balance of efficiency and\naccuracy at least until the next generation of LLM's are capable of handling it fully."}, {"title": "Limitations and Future Research", "content": "Despite its promising results, this study has limitations that warrant consideration.\nThe focus on Finnish sports union data may limit the generalizability of the findings to\nother contexts or data types.

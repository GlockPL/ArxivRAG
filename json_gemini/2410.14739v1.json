{"title": "Toward a Unified Graph-Based Representation of Medical Data for Precision Oncology Medicine", "authors": ["Davide Belluomo", "Tiziana Calamoneri", "Giacomo Paesani", "Ivano Salvo"], "abstract": "We present a new unified graph-based representation of medical data, combining genetic information and medical records of patients with medical knowledge via a unique knowledge graph. This approach allows us to infer meaningful information and explanations that would be unavailable by looking at each data set separately. The systematic use of different databases, managed throughout the built knowledge graph, gives new insights toward a better understanding of oncology medicine. Indeed, we reduce some useful medical tasks to well-known problems in theoretical computer science for which efficient algorithms exist.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "One of the recent and numerous applications of graph theory is network medicine [1] that aims to identify, prevent, and treat diseases: graph-based approaches have offered an effective tool to systematically explore the intrinsic complexity of diseases, leading to the identification of disease specificity, disease-associated genetic mutations and a new way to assign treatments to patients. A new approach in the framework of network medicine is the so-called personalized or precision medicine, that is, the systematic use of individual patient characteristics to determine which treatment option is most likely to result in a better average outcome for the patient.\nIn particular, a new trend in precision oncology aims to shape drug treatments based on the specific gene mutation profile of the particular patient (see, for example, [16]). In the last 20 years, medical practitioners tested this new approach and obtained an improvement regarding its effectiveness. However, precision medicine developments have not been in line with the expectations. A common belief among oncologists and researchers in bioinformatics is that the discrepancy between real and expected performance can be partially explained by looking at the role of gene mutations in cancer evolution: the ambitious long-term goal of our research is to contribute to filling the gap in medical knowledge by examining and comparing genetic profiles of an extensive database of patients together with different treatment outcomes."}, {"title": "2 Data and Methods", "content": "The main idea of this work is to collect together as much information as possible, coming from the structured data of different databases recording data from medical studies, and official documents of regulatory agencies, in order to study oncological diseases and, in particular, relationships among gene mutations, diseases, and treatment effectiveness, and try to infer vital information supporting the medical community.\nIn the following, we propose to use a graph (the knowledge graph H described in Subsection 2.2) to represent all such information in a uniform way. This approach has several advantages: we can give support to study and reduce medical issues by means of well-studied graph problems that, in turn, have well-known solutions based on efficient graph algorithms. Moreover, we can exploit the flexibility of graphs as a data structure, and easily support a function for quickly updating the information stored in the graph H; this is especially useful when new medical studies are published or when a new drug is individuated, and it is useful to incorporate this information in the graph. It is worth noting that this approach is in contrast to the static graphs created after a training phase and using them as predictive models."}, {"title": "2.1 Preliminary Definitions", "content": "We choose to favor intuition over formalism so, in this subsection, we informally give some basic definitions concerning graphs that will be useful in the following. The reader interested in a more formal setting can refer, for example, to [6].\nA graph G = (V, E) is constituted by a finite set V of elements, known as nodes, and a collection of edges E, connecting pairs of nodes, representing some kind of binary relation. It is possible to label some nodes and/or edges to annotate them with additional information. The set of nodes that are connected through an edge to the same node v constitute the neighborhood of v, and a path of G is a sequence of edges that joins a sequence of nodes.\nA graph G' = (V', E') is a subgraph of G = (V, E) if V' \u2286 V, E' \u2286 E, and every edge in E' has both endpoints in V'. The subgraph induced by a node set"}, {"title": "2.2 The Knowledge Graph H", "content": "The graph H, which is the core of this work, is built as the union of three graphs: the graph G, storing Genetic information of a group of patients (whose edges are colored in Green); the graph R, storing information from patient medical Records (whose edges are colored in Red), and the graph M, storing some general information that we will call Medical knowledge (whose edges are colored in Magenta).\nWhile graphs G, R, and M share some (set of) nodes (for example, the set of patients), their edge sets are pairwise disjoint.\nThe green graph is bipartite and is defined as G = (Pa \u222a Mu, EG) where:\nPa is a set of encrypted recorded patients in the database; a mapping \u03c1: Pa \u2192 N labels every patient p \u2208 Pa with their survival period, that is the time interval that spans between the diagnosis of a specific disease and the time of the study, if the patient is still alive, or the time of the patient's death, otherwise. Patients are also labeled with a boolean mappinga : Pa \u2192 {T, F} that represents whether the patient is alive or not at the time of the study: for every p \u2208 Pa, a(p) = T if p is alive and F, otherwise.\nMu is a set of gene mutations. Observe that a gene can have more than one mutation;\nthe set of green edges E\u00e7 contains an edge (p, m) if the patient p has the mutation m, and this edge is labeled with the variant allele frequency (VAF) associated with m for patient p;\nThe red graph is 3-partite and defined as R = (Pa \u222a Di \u222a Dr, ER) where:\nPa is the set of patients as defined in graph G;\nDi is a set of oncological diseases, that affect patients in Pa;\nDr is a set of drugs of interest, possibly labeled with a string \u03b2 annotating adverse effects;\nthe set of red edges Er contains: an edge (d, p) if the patient p is affected by the disease d; an edge (p, f) if the patient p has been treated with the drug f; these edges are labeled with a pair of values (t, e) where t \u2208 N is the number of treatments preceded it and e \u2208 {p, u, r, n} (standing for positive, unaltered, reduced, negative) represents the effectiveness of that drug; clearly, more drugs could have the same value of t when a cocktail of drugs has been administrated;\nThe magenta graph is 3-partite and defined as M = (Mu \u222a Di \u222a Dr, EM) where:\nMu, Di, and Dr are defined as in graphs G and R;"}, {"title": "2.3 Experiment Design", "content": "In our experiments, we constructed the green graph G by exploiting database cBioPortal [2,3,7], from which we extract the genetic information of each patient. Gene mutations are derived from NGS (Next Generation Sequencing).\nThe information encoded in the red graph R can be obtained from the examination of a large number of medical records, which not only keeps track of the diseases affecting the patients, but also the treatment history, a quantitative estimation of the responses, and the survival period. In our experiments, we use cBioPortal again, to deduce this information.\nAt least in principle, the magenta graph M should store the vast and ever-evolving medical knowledge. In particular, in our experiments, we consider the DisGeNET database [21] and regulatory agencies databases (see, for example, PharmGKB [27,28]) for the information about the interaction between specific diseases and gene mutations, and for approved drugs targeting gene mutations, respectively.\nThrough knowledge graph H, we can answer many questions by exploiting graph algorithms. The underlying idea is that the involvement of multiple databases and subgraphs gives us robust and precise machinery to deduce meaningful information. Here, for each of the three listed examples, we describe the medical issue, we model it into a graph problem, propose an algorithmic solution, and highlight which part of the knowledge graph H is involved."}, {"title": "Comparing medical knowledge and data evidence", "content": "A natural issue is understanding whether the medical knowledge agrees with information that can be inferred from medical records. Using the information in the graph H, a possible question is the following: does data evidence from G \u222a R match the medical knowledge stored in M? An answer to this question can improve the understanding of the relationship between diseases and gene mutations.\nOn one hand, thanks to the red edges of H, fixing a disease d, we consider set Pa(d) of all patients affected by d, corresponding to all the nodes in the neighborhood of d in Pa. We define Mu\u222a(d) as the set of all gene mutations affecting at least one patient in Pa(d) and Mu\u2229(d) as the set of all mutations affecting every patient in Pa(d) (through green edges).\nOn the other hand, we determine through magenta edges the set Mujd of gene mutations known to be involved in disease d, which results from medical knowledge. In our experiments, we label magenta edges between a mutation and a disease with the so-called GDA score. This score, provided by the DisGeNET database, ranges between 0 and 1 and takes into account the number and type of sources (level of curation, model organisms), and the number of publications supporting the association between m and d. In this setting, the set Muja can be computed by considering the neighbors of d in the magenta graph having GDA score close to 1.\nProvided that the sample of patients is sufficiently broad, we have that Mujd should be contained in Mu\u222a (d): every gene mutation known to be involved in d necessarily occurs in some patient with disease d. Next, we compare the two sets of mutations Muja and Mu\u2229(d) and distinguish the following cases: if Mula = Mun (d) then the medical knowledge perfectly matches with the experimental evidence for disease d; otherwise, either the medical knowledge is incomplete for disease d because there are gene mutations that are present in every patient with disease d but are not anticipated by the current medical knowledge, or the evidence is inconsistent for disease d because some patients with disease d do not have a predicted gene mutation, or a combination of them. In such cases, deeper examinations are suggested.\nFor each d\u2208 Di computing Muja, Mu(d) and Mu\u2229(d) can be efficiently done through standard graph search algorithms, such as breadth-first search."}, {"title": "Partitioning patients into homogenous groups", "content": "Medical evidence shows (e.g., see [22]) that the percentage of patients that positively react to treatments is less than expected, although drugs are chosen based on the patient specific gene mutation profile. The general feeling among experts is that concentrating on driver gene mutations is not enough.\nTo face this general problem, here we propose some possible approaches, all based on the idea of recognizing groups of patients that, for some reason, can be considered as similar. Then, we can propose to medical doctors a deep analysis of the gene mutations of patients in the same groups, so that they can look for the presence of specific gene mutations that the drug treatment has not targeted: some of these gene mutations could inhibit the cure and be considered responsible for the treatment failure."}, {"title": "Optimized drug treatments", "content": "Here, we propose an algorithm joining the information obtained separately on the one hand from G \u222a M and on the other hand from R to suggest drug treatments optimizing the benefits and minimizing adverse effects for a specific patient.\nFor any gene mutation m, we can exploit magenta edges to deduce the set Drim of the drugs that have an effect on m. Hypothetically, administering to a patient p all the drugs in \u222amp Drimp (where mp is any gene mutation of p, selected through the green edges) would guarantee the best treatment for p.\nNevertheless, given the possible adverse effects of these drugs (possibly depending on their interactions), only few of them can be administered simultaneously to a patient, even at the cost of ignoring some gene mutations. Indeed, in practice, only very few mutations of a patient are being treated: current drugs are designed to deal with very specific gene mutations, known as target. Hence, given a patient p and a (small) subset Z of their gene mutations, the aim is to compute a drug subset W of minimum size that targets all gene mutations in Z.\nThis problem is related to the well-studied minimum hitting set problem, defined as follows. Let U be a finite set and U = {U1, U2, . . .} a collection of subsets of U. A hitting set for U is a subset U' of U such that Ui \u2229 U' \u2260 \u00d8, for every i. The minimum hitting set problem consists of determining a hitting set of minimum size. Computing the minimum hitting set is known to be computationally hard [23].\nOur problem can be modeled in terms of the minimum hitting set problem as follows: U coincides with the set of the drugs Dr and each Ui is a Dr\u0131m, for some m\u2208 Z. Thus, solving the minimum hitting set problem on this instance gives a minimum-size drug treatment that targets all gene mutations in Z.\nIn the literature, some papers propose similar strategies. In particular, in [25], the authors solve the hitting set problem with a heuristic approach restricting to"}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "In this section, we show the results of some experiments. Due to the lack of some crucial information in the public databases and the difficulty of getting some part of it, we only partially address the objectives described in Subsection 2.2; nevertheless, we try to keep the flavor of the underlying idea.\nWe focus on three different medical studies: Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer [13] with 930 patients, MSK MetTropism [20] with 24755 patients, and MSK-IMPACT Clinical Sequencing Cohort [29] with 7091 patients. We chose these studies because they consider a sequencing technology guaranteeing a 500-gene panel for each patient."}, {"title": "Analysis of data in public databases", "content": "We observed that the databases we use as reference, CBioPortal and DisGeNET, are not coherent; indeed, while the former contains specific genetic mutations, the latter deals only with mutated genes. It follows that, in order to compare the extracted results, we have to downgrade the genetic mutations to simple mutated genes. In order to have an idea about how much information we are losing in this way, we compare the data extracted from CBioPortal, counting them in different ways."}, {"title": "Comparing medical knowledge and data evidence: Lung Adenocarcinoma", "content": "We now consider only the patients characterized by the same disease d\u2208 Di. Analogously to Table 1, Table 2 shows data w.r.t. the 3972 patients affected by one of the most frequent diseases included in the MSK Met Tropism study, namely Lung Adenocarcinoma.\nComparing Tables 1 and 2, one can observe sensible differences: for example, the gene mutation KRAS_12_25398285_25398285 appears in only 4.8% of all patients while in 14.7% of those affected by Lung Adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the gene mutation TERT_5_1295228_1295228 appears in 6.7% of the patients in Table 1 while is negligible in Table 2. An even more notable discrepancy can be observed in the gene EGFR: only 6.6% of the total population of patients has this gene mutated, while the percentage increases to 29.4 for the patients affected by Lung Adenocarcinoma. These considerations are not meant to infer any conclusion at the medical level but, especially if joined with similar studies, aim to suggest a direction for further research."}, {"title": "Partitioning patients into homogenous groups: survival period", "content": "Estimating the effectiveness of drug treatment is a difficult task because it takes into account different parameters. One of these parameters is the survival period.\nWe partition the patient population into three sets: the first one Pa\u226536 = {p \u2208 \u03a1\u03b1 | \u03c1(p) \u2265 36} contains all the patients whose survival period is of at least 36 months, the second one Pa<6 = {p \u2208 Pa | p(p) \u2264 6 ^\u03b1(p) = F} contains all the patients whose survival period is of at most 6 months and are marked as deceased, and the third set contains all the remaining patients.\nWe selected the 5295 patients of the MSK MetTropism study in Pa\u226536 and the 2768 patients in Pa<6 and summarized the results in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. Comparing Table 1 with Tables 4 and 5, one can observe that the distribution of the percentages of their mutations completely changes. As an example, TP53, KRAS, and TERT dramatically increase their percentages, whereas PIK3CA, EGFR, and STR11 decrease significantly their percentages. This behavior can be explained by the medical awareness that certain combinations of mutations indicate either a different response to treatments or a different evolution of the disease. A deep study of these results should be performed by medical doctors, who could individuate interesting combinations of gene mutations, both in the population of patients with a low survival period and in that one with a high survival period."}, {"title": "Partitioning patients into homogenous groups: genetic mutation profile", "content": "Moreover, to understand whether there are some groups of patients that can be considered similar, we implemented two different similarity measures based"}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In this paper, we designed a unified graph-based representation of medical data for precision oncology medicine and proposed three possible applications whose solutions exploit known results from theoretical computer science.\nOur approach's novelty lies in how we store and deduce information.

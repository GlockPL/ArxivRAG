The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations: how to define problem-solving competency in a genAI era, and how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research takes steps in examining these considerations by studying how and why college students are currently using genAI tools in their STEM coursework, with a specific focus on how they employ these tools to support their problem-solving.\nResults: We conducted an online survey of 40 STEM college students from diverse institutions across the US. In addition, we surveyed 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor views on effective and ineffective genAI tool use in STEM courses and their guidance for students. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most com-mon use cases of genAI tools in STEM coursework include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools in STEM coursework was to save time. Moreover, we found that over half of the student participants reported simply inputting a problem for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes.\nConclusions: These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies.

Within education, there is a growing recognition that AI will significantly impact not only how we teach and learn (National Education Association, 2024), but also what we should teach students to prepare them for a future where AI is increasingly integrated in daily tasks (Shio-hira, 2021). The potential for genAI to disrupt established educational practices is especially pronounced in college STEM education for several reasons. First, develop-ing problem-solving competency is one of the major goals in STEM education (Honey et al, 2020; ABET, 2021), yet teaching, practicing and assessing this competency effectively and authentically have been challenging given the common instructional practices in STEM courses (Felder, 2012). These disciplines have traditionally relied on well-defined problems in homework assignments and exams to develop and assess stu-dent conceptual understanding and problem-solving competency (Jonassen and Hung, 2015; Montgomery et al, 2024). However, LLMs have demonstrated high proficiency in solving these types of problems (OpenAI et al, 2024; West, 2023), potentially alter-ing students' study habits, problem-solving approaches, and engagements with course materials. This capability of LLMs may thus render traditional instructional practices even less effective for developing and measuring STEM problem-solving competency. Second, as AI tools increasingly handle routine, well-defined tasks in technology-driven fields (Levy and Murnane, 2013), STEM education must evolve to develop students' competencies in effectively leveraging AI as a tool to solve authentic, complex problems that require human judgment and decision making. This shift is critical for preparing college graduates for the future of an AI-augmented workforce.\nBuilding on our extensive empirical research in improving authentic problem-solving education in college STEM courses (Salehi, 2018; Burkholder et al, 2020; Price et al, 2022), we now examine the emerging influence and potential of genAI tools on students' learning experiences in STEM coursework, with a focus on how these tools are affecting students' problem-solving approaches. We seek to contribute to the ongo-ing discourse surrounding genAI's impact on education by exploring the extent and ways in which college students are using genAI tools, what training they need to lever-age these tools effectively for their learning and to prepare them for a future where AI is an integral part of it. Specifically, we propose the following research questions:\nRQ1: How are college students currently using genAI tools generally and in their STEM coursework?"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "2.1 Technology's Role in Education\nOver the past few decades, the education field has witnessed waves of technological innovations, from Skinner's teaching machine in the 1950s to the more recent emer-gence of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and adaptive computer-assisted instructional programs (Reich, 2020). Research on educational technologies has shown mixed results: while some studies found positive effects of technology programs such as one-to-one laptops on academic achievement (Zheng et al, 2016), others documented limited effectiveness or even negative consequences (Mueller and Oppenheimer, 2014; Carter et al, 2017). These results highlight the complexity of technology integration in education (Cuban, 2001). As Roy Pea on his examination of technology's impacts on human cognition noted, technologies are not merely tools we use, but have the potential to fundamentally alter our behavior and cognitive processes, hence reorga-nize how we think, teach, and learn (Pea, 1985). With the emergence of genAI, we are once again facing the question of how this new technology may impact human learning, and in return educational practices, in ways both promising and troubling.\nGenerative AI technologies, such as LLMs, are advanced AI systems pre-trained on simple tasks like predicting the next word in a text sequence (Brown et al, 2020). Through fine-tuning and prompting methods (Liu et al, 2022; Wei et al, 2022), these models have evolved beyond next-token prediction to unlocking a wide range of sophisticated capabilities, including engaging in real-time conversations as chatbots (Thoppilan et al, 2022), summarizing complex texts (Zhang et al, 2020), and gener-ating writings in diverse genres (Brown et al, 2020). Generative AI technologies such as LLMs have the potential to transform teaching and learning practices through automating the creation of instructional materials, enhancing assessment methods, and providing readily available personalized support to students (Kasneci et al, 2023). At the same time, the capability of LLMs to instantly generate contextually relevant and coherent content across various subjects poses a risk of students using them to complete coursework without genuine comprehension as a result of bypassing critical learning processes.\nA number of studies have surveyed college instructors and students to understand their perspectives and experiences with genAI (Amani et al, 2023; Goldberg et al, 2024; Baek et al, 2024). These studies often highlight the duality of opportunities and risks associated with using genAI tools in education. For example, a survey for university instructors and students in the US and Australia revealed moderate usage of genAI tools for coursework and professional purposes (Smolansky et al, 2023). At the same"}, {"title": "2.2 GenAI's Role in Discipline-specific Education", "content": "Recent studies have begun to examine how genAI tools can be effectively integrated to support the unique learning activities and pedagogical goals in different disciplines. In language instruction, a study involving college instructors found significant interest in adopting genAI to provide personalized feedback for students at different language proficiency levels, especially in grammar and pronunciation (Kohnke et al, 2023). At the same time, instructors recognized the urgency to address potential academic dis-honesty issues arising from AI-generated writing. In medical education, recent research has identified promising applications of genAI such as self-directed learning, patient simulation, and writing assistance, while highlighting challenges such as maintaining academic integrity and ensuring data accuracy (Preiksaitis et al, 2023). In computer science education, a research project combined a systematic literature review with a survey of instructors and students from 20 countries to examine the use of genAI tools such as Copilot (Prather et al, 2023). The findings suggest that genAI tools could potentially enhance instructor productivity by aiding in the creation of instruc-tional materials and automating grading and feedback in programming courses. On the other hand, the study also highlighted significant concerns, including students becoming overly dependent on these tools for coding tasks and potential academic integrity issues due to student submission of AI-generated solutions. These concerns are not unique to programming courses. Across disciplines, the pitfalls associated with genAI tools often share common elements of compromising academic integrity and/or bypassing critical learning processes, particularly related to more complex cognitive constructs such as problem-solving."}, {"title": "2.3 GenAI's Role in STEM Education", "content": "The applications and implications of genAI tools in science education have received comparatively less attention than other fields. A study analyzing genAI-related poli-cies in US higher education found a significant imbalance in the guidance provided for different disciplines (McDonald et al, 2024). While the majority of R1 institutions (116 out of 131) had genAI-related policies as of November 2023, the more prevalent fields for their policies were in writing and humanities; only half of the institutions (n=58) addressed the use of genAI in STEM courses.

The majority of participants (n = 38) were enrolled in four-year universities, with one participant each from a community college and a vocational school. Participants also spanned all undergraduate years, with 3 freshmen, 7 sophomores, 15 juniors, and 15 seniors. Our instructor sample included 28 physics faculty with diverse levels of teaching experiences: 7 have taught for 4 years or less, 6 for 5-14 years, and 15 for 15 years or more. Faculty participants were predominantly from four-year universities and liberal arts colleges (n = 25), with the others from community colleges and a high school. Geographically, all student participants were based in the US. Among faculty participants, 24 were from North America, while 2 each were from Asia and Europe."}, {"title": "4.2 General Use of GenAI Tools", "content": "College students in our sample reported high adoption rates for genAI tools. Only 3 students (7.5%) reported that they had not used any genAI tools as of May 2024. Regarding the adoption timeline, 4 students (10%) began using such tools in 2022 or earlier, 29 (72.5%) in 2023, and 4 (10%) in 2024. In terms of specific tools, the free version of ChatGPT was the most widely used tool, with 37 students reporting its use. This was followed by the free versions of Gemini and Copilot, used by around a quarter of students each (n = 11 and 10, respectively). Paid versions of these tools saw significantly lower adoption rates. Fig. 1 presents the count of students using each of these tools. These results show that students were more likely to access the free versions of frontier LLMs, indicating that financial cost was one factor impacting college students' use of genAI tools."}, {"title": "4.3 GenAI Use in STEM Coursework", "content": "In the context of STEM coursework, our survey found that while 6 students reported never using genAI tools in their STEM courses, the remaining 34 students (85%) uti-lized these tools for a variety of tasks as summarized in Fig. 2. Using genAI tools to find explanations was the most common use, reported by 30 students (75%). This was followed by exploring related topics (n = 25, 62.5%), summarizing papers/readings (n = 24, 60%), supporting in-class activities (n = 23, 57.5%), and helping with problem-set questions (n = 23, 57.5%). We did not find any significant association between students' year in college and their usage patterns. When asked about their main rea-son for using genAI tools in STEM courses, the majority of students (n = 20, 50%) indicated that it saved them time. The next most common reasons were the ability to ask questions without feeling judged and the accessibility of these tools, each cited by 5 students (12.5%). Table 2 presents the detailed answer options for why using genAI tools, their corresponding constructs, and participants' response frequencies.

We first examined the primary benefits by qualitatively analyzing instructor and student responses. Multiple codes were assigned to responses that mentioned more than one benefit. Both students and instructors identified a range of benefits of integrating genAI tools into STEM edu-cation. Notably, the instructor responses tended to cluster around a few key themes, while the student responses were more diverse. The most frequently cited benefit by both groups was that genAI tools can provide personalized learning support and resources, mentioned by 36% of students and 50% of faculty. For example, one stu-dent mentioned that \"they (genAI tools) can assist with explanations to problems or help guide you in the right direction. They are good to help you understand the con-cepts in math and science courses that may be hard to follow for some.\" Similarly, an instructor mentioned that \"if used correctly, it could improve students' conceptual understanding of topics, by making them ask 'right' questions in the prompt.\"\nAt the same time, students mentioned the benefits of using genAI to efficiently search and retrieve information (16%) and summarize information (9%), reflecting how they valued tools that can support their immediate learning needs and save time. For example, one student reported that \"it also can get very descriptive in its answers that you simply cannot get with basic search engines.\" Another reported that \"it can give you a quick summary in an efficient manner in most cases, no matter the subject, you just have to feed it the information.\" Additional benefits identified by students include support for specific tasks such as coding, writing, calculation, and brainstorming, as well as efficient handling of repetitive, mundane work. On the other hand, instructors in our survey highlighted genAI's capacity to create novel learning and assessment materials (32%) and support teaching preparation (32%), reflecting their focus on instructional design and teaching. For example, several instructors proposed creating exercises that ask students to evaluate AI-generated solutions to physics problems, thereby challenging students to discern incorrect reasoning to enhance their learning.\nOn the risk side, both students and instructors identified several key risks asso-ciated with using genAI tools in STEM education, with significant overlap in their major concerns. Misinformation emerged as the primary risk identified by both groups, cited by 67% of faculty and 49% of students. This concern is related to the poten-tial inaccuracy of AI-generated content and the risk of creating misunderstandings among students. For instance, an instructor noted that \"while ChatGPT has been demonstrated to sometimes be able to solve problems or provide explanations, it often provides total nonsense. For people freshly learning the concepts, I would be concerned"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The findings of this study provide important insights into the current landscape of genAI tool use by college students in their STEM coursework. First, our survey revealed a high adoption rate of genAI tools among students, with 37 out 40 par-ticipants reporting using predominantly free versions of LLM tools. Second, students utilized these tools for a range of tasks in their STEM coursework, including find-ing explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions.\nThe high adoption rate of genAI tools among students indicate students' willing-ness to engage with this emerging technology. At the same time, students' reliance on free versions of these tools has significant implications for STEM education. Specifi-cally, students' prevalent use of genAI for finding explanations for STEM topics and solutions to STEM problems poses a risk of being exposed to and reinforcing misunder-standings if the AI-generated content is inaccurate. This risk is potentially exacerbated due to students' use of free versions of LLMs, which may not always incorporate the latest improvement in model performance regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date information. Moreover, the accessibility gap between free and paid versions of genAI tools raises educational equity concerns, as students with access to paid versions may receive better information, potentially gaining an academic advantage over those lim-ited to free versions. Consequently, colleges should consider providing free access to reliable, education-focused genAI tools for all students. Additionally, there is a press-ing need to develop students' critical evaluation mindsets and skills when working with"}, {"title": "6 Limitations", "content": "There are several limitations associated with this study that warrant consideration. First, our relatively small sample size of 40 college students and 28 instructors may limit the generalizability of our findings. However, it's important to note that partici-pants came from diverse institutions across the US, which mitigates the potential bias that could arise from the academic policies or culture of any single institution. This institutional diversity enhances the breadth of perspectives captured in our study, even with limited sample size. Nonetheless, the patterns and insights identified, par-ticularly regarding specific uses of genAI tools, would benefit from further validation through large-scale investigations. Second, our study relied on voluntary participation through an online platform, which may have introduced selection bias. Students who chose to participate in our survey might have been more familiar with or interested in genAI tools, potentially skewing our results towards higher adoption rates and more positive attitudes. As a result, this sample may not be representative of the entire US college student population studying STEM subjects. Lastly, the study focused on STEM courses with a particular emphasis on problem-solving. This focus limits the applicability of our findings to non-STEM disciplines, each of which may have unique challenges and opportunities for genAI integration. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the use of genAI tools among college students by highlighting current use patterns, perceptions, and implications for STEM education."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Image generation models has been through significant changes, transitioning from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to diffusion models. GANs, introduced by Goodfellow et al. [1], set a new standard for generating realistic images by employing a dual-network architecture consisting of a generator and a discriminator. Despite their success, GANS faced challenges such as training instability and mode collapse, limiting their applicability in certain scenarios [2]. In response to these limitations, diffusion models emerged as a robust alternative, utilizing a process that iteratively denoises data to generate high-fidelity images [3]. These models demonstrated superior stability during training and the ability to produce diverse and detailed outputs [4]. Recent advancements have further enhanced diffusion models' efficiency and scalability, making them a prominent choice in image generation tasks [5]. The shift from GANs to diffusion models marks a critical evolution in image generation paradigms, enabling more reliable and versatile applications across various domains.\nDeep generative image model development has been propelled by the adoption of large-scale training methodologies. Access to extensive datasets, such as ImageNet and LAION, has enabled models to learn diverse and intricate patterns, enhancing their ability to generate high-quality images [6], [7]. The evolution of hardware infrastructure, including powerful GPUs and TPUs, has facilitated the training of increasingly complex models [8]. Scaling laws have demonstrated that larger models tend to perform better, provided they are trained with sufficient data and computational resources [9]. Innovations in distributed training techniques, such as model and data parallelism, have made it feasible to train models with billions of parameters efficiently [10], [11]. The integration of cloud computing platforms has eased the access to the necessary computational power, allowing a broader range of researchers to engage in large-scale model training [12]. These factors collectively have enabled the creation of sophisticated generative models like DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion, which exhibit remarkable capabilities in producing nuanced and high-fidelity images [13], [14]. The rise of large-scale training has thus been a cornerstone in the progression of deep generative image models, driving improvements in both performance and applicability.\nFoundation models have revolutionized image generation by using large-scale datasets and versatile architectures to perform a wide array of tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Models such as DALL-E [15] and Stable Diffusion [16] demonstrates outstanding ability to generate high-quality, diverse images from textual descriptions. These models utilize transformer-based architectures and diffusion processes, enabling them to capture intricate patterns and semantics from extensive training data [5]. The scalability of foundation models allows for improved performance across various domains, including art creation, data augmentation, and interactive design tools [17]. Combining multimodal learning in foundation models facilitates the seamless combination of text and image inputs, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of image generation systems [18]. Recent advancements have focused on optimizing these models for efficiency and accessibility, ensuring that high-quality image generation is attainable even with limited computational resources [16]. These foundation models marks a significant milestone in image generation, providing robust and adaptable solutions that cater to a diverse range of applications."}, {"title": "B. Current State and Challenges", "content": "Deep generative image models have made significant strides recently, demonstrating their potential in applications like art creation, data augmentation, and simulation. Yet, several challenges still limit their broader use. Key issues include high computational demands, balancing image quality with generation speed, and complex ethical concerns. Addressing these challenges is essential for responsibly advancing generative models in practical settings. The following sections explore these obstacles, pointing out where more research and innovation are needed.\n1) Computational Scalability: As generative image models increase in size and complexity, the demand for computational resources surges, leading to significant scalability challenges. Large models need substantial memory and processing power, making efficient training and deployment difficult [3], [19]. Recent research has aimed to improve scalability without sacrificing performance. Techniques like model pruning, quantization, and the design of more efficient neural network architectures show promise in reducing computational costs [20]. Additionally, distributed computing and specialized hardware accelerators, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), help manage the heavy computational load [21]. However, balancing scalability with high-quality image generation remains an ongoing challenge, requiring further innovation and exploration.\n2) Quality-Speed Trade-offs: Balancing image quality with inference speed remains a critical challenge in deploying deep generative models. High-fidelity image generation often demands extensive computational resources and longer processing times, making real-time applications difficult [22], [23]. Researchers have developed strategies to speed up image generation without significant quality loss. Techniques like knowledge distillation, where smaller models mimic the performance of larger ones, and lightweight architectures have proven effective in cutting inference times [24]. Further, advancements in algorithmic efficiency\u2014such as optimized sampling methods and fewer iterative steps in diffusion models\u2014help accelerate the process [25]. These approaches aim to balance high image quality with the speed needed for practical, scalable deployment.\n3) Ethics and Limitations: The deployment of deep generative image models raises critical ethical challenges that demand careful management. A major concern is their potential to produce misleading or harmful content, like deepfakes, which can deceive or manipulate audiences [26], [27]. Moreover, biases in training data risk embedding and amplifying societal prejudices within generated images [28]. Intellectual property issues also come into play, as using copyrighted materials without permission in training datasets leads to both legal and ethical conflicts [29]. To address these risks, it is essential to adopt strict data curation, fairness-focused training protocols, and regulatory frameworks that oversee the use and distribution of generative models [30]. Transparency in model development and deployment can further build trust, ensuring generative technologies are applied responsibly and ethically [18]. Tackling these ethical challenges is crucial for the responsible progression and societal acceptance of generative image technologies."}, {"title": "II.

New frameworks like transformer-based models, hybrid architectures, and refined diffusion techniques set new standards for high-resolution, contextually accurate image generation. This section examines the main architectural strategies driving these advancements, highlighting transformers, hybrid methods that blend different generative techniques, and major improvements in diffusion."}, {"title": "A. Transformer-based Architectures", "content": "1) Diffusion-based Transformer Models:\na) DiT (Diffusion Transformers): Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) mark a major advancement in generative modeling, especially for text-to-image synthesis. Traditional diffusion models, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have mostly relied on U-Net architectures for the denoising process [3]. DiTs, however, bring in transformer architectures and utilize their scalability and flexibility to capture complex data relationships, enabling high-quality and high-resolution images from textual descriptions [31], [32].\nDiTs use a transformer to model the diffusion process and work on latent patches of input images. DiTs use a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode images into a latent space, creating a compact, manageable representation. The transformer then processes these latent patches, capturing intricate patterns and relationships within the data. During denoising, it gradually refines these patches in a sequence of transformations, reconstructing the image with high fidelity. In the forward diffusion process, Gaussian noise is added to these latent representations across a sequence of time steps. The reverse process, guided by the transformer, iteratively denoises and reconstructs the original image by minimizing the difference between predicted noise and the actual noise added during forward diffusion [31].\nb) Parti Model Innovations: The Pathways Autoregressive Text-to-Image (Parti) model, developed by Google Research, brings several advancements to text-to-image generation with a fully autoregressive approach, framing image generation as a sequential prediction task similar to language models. Parti uses transformers to capture detailed image features without relying on the iterative denoising used by diffusion models, producing images from low-res to intricate, high-res outputs. This flexibility arises from a two-stage training process: first, learning core structures at lower resolutions, then refining details at higher ones. It breaks images into patches, efficiently handles high-res generation with minimal computational strain [33].\n2) Token-based Transformer Models:\na) Muse: The Muse model by Google applies masked generative transformers to the text-to-image generation task. Unlike other models that work with continuous pixel values, Muse operates on discrete image tokens (for example, an image x can be encoded into a grid of tokens $z \\in V^{h \\times w}$, where $V$ represents the vocabulary of learned codes, and $h, w$ are the spatial dimensions of the tokenized image), enhancing both quality and efficiency in image generation. It uses a transformer architecture, masked image modeling (MIM), trained on a masked modeling objective, where it predicts masked image tokens based on the text and the unmasked context, similar to masked language modeling in NLP. Given a text prompt $t$ and a partially masked image representation $z$, the model learns the distribution\n$p(z|z,t) = \\prod_{i \\in M} p(z_i|z, t)$ (1)\nwhere $M$ is the set of masked positions. Muse is conditioned on text embeddings from a pre-trained language model and can interpret nuanced language prompts and generate coherent visual outputs [34].\nb) CogView2 Developments: The CogView model series (Table I) uses a token-based transformer for text-to-image generation. The original CogView model introduced in 2021 by researchers at Tsinghua University encodes images as sequences of discrete tokens via a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), effectively turning image data into a finite set of symbols manageable by a transformer. With its 4-billion-parameter transformer, CogView generates images by predicting each token in sequence, guided by the input text. This initial model showed impressive results on the MS COCO dataset, producing coherent, detailed images that surpassed GAN-based models [35].\nCogView2 focuses on faster generation of high-resolution images. It introduced hierarchical transformers for a multi-stage generation process that produced detailed images more efficiently. CogView2 sped up the sampling process tenfold while maintaining image quality incorporating local parallel autoregressive generation. It also added text-guided image editing [36]. CogView3 further refined efficiency by shifting from the autoregressive approach to a relay diffusion model. It creates low-resolution images and enhances them through super-resolution stages. Relay diffusion slashed training and inference costs while maintained quality with faster generation times [37]."}, {"title": "B. Diffusion Model Breakthroughs", "content": "1) Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) define a Markov chain of diffusion steps that gradually convert a data distribution into pure noise, then learn to reverse this process [3].\na) Forward Diffusion Process: The forward process is defined as a Markov chain (q represents the probability distribution in the process) that gradually adds Gaussian noise to data over T timesteps:\n$q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I)$ (2)\nwhere $\\beta_t$ represents the noise schedule, $x_t$ is the noisy image at timestep $t$, and $x_0$ is the original image. This process can also be expressed in closed form for any timestep t:\n$q(x_t|x_0) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{a}_t}x_0, (1 - \\bar{a}_t)I)$ (3)\nwith $a_t = 1 - \\beta_t$ and $\\bar{a}_t = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} a_i$.\nb) Reparameterization: Using the reparameterization trick, a technique used in VAEs to allow the backpropagation of gradients through stochastic variables, making it feasible to train models with stochastic layers using gradient-based methods [38], $x_t$ can be sampled using:\n$x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{a}_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{a}_t}\\epsilon, \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ (4)\nc) Reverse Process: The reverse process learns to denoise by estimating the noise:\n$P_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t))$ (5)\nwhere the mean is parameterized as:\n$\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_t}}(x_t - \\frac{1 - a_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{a}_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t))$ (6)\nd) Training Objective: The model is trained using a simplified variational bound:\n$L_{simple} = \\mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \\epsilon} [||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)||^2]$ (7)\nwhere t is uniformly sampled from {1, ..., T}, $\\epsilon$ is random Gaussian noise, and $\\epsilon_\\theta$ is the neural network predicting the noise.\ne) Sampling Algorithm: During inference, sampling is performed from the reverse process following:\n1) Sample $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$\n2) For t = T, ..., 1:\n$x_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_t}}(x_t - \\frac{1 - a_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{a}_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)) + \\sigma_t z$ (8)\nwhere $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and $\\sigma_t$ is the sampling noise scale\nThe variance $\\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t)$ can be fixed to:\n$\\Sigma_\\theta(x_t, t) = \\beta_t I$ (9)\nThe DDPM framework enables the model to learn the reverse process of gradually denoising random Gaussian noise into meaningful data samples, establishing the foundation for modern diffusion-based generative models [3].\n2) Latent Diffusion Models: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) marks a significant advancement in generative modeling, which addresses the inefficiencies in previous diffusion models. LDM performs the diffusion process in a compressed latent space rather than pixel space, leading to substantial improvements in both speed and memory usage while maintaining generation quality [16].\na) Perceptual Compression Stage: The first stage involves training an autoencoder to learn a perceptually equivalent, but computationally more efficient representation of the input data. Given an input image x, the encoder $\\mathcal{E}$ maps it to a lower-dimensional latent space:\n$z = \\mathcal{E}(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times w \\times c}$ (10)\nwhere the spatial dimensions h and w are typically reduced by a factor f (usually 8x to 32\u00d7), and the channel dimension c is optimized for information density. The autoencoder is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss and KL-regularization:\n$L_{AE} = ||\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{E}(x)) - x||^2 + L_{KL}$ (11)\nThis ensures that the latent space maintains a balance between compression and perceptual fidelity.\nb) Latent Diffusion Process: The second stage adapts the diffusion process to operate in the learned latent space. The forward process defines a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the latent representation:\n$q(z_t|z_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(z_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}z_{t-1}, \\beta_t I)$ (12)\nwhere $\\beta_t$ represents the noise schedule. The reverse process, parameterized by a neural network $\\theta$, learns to denoise by estimating:\n$P_\\theta(z_{t-1}|z_t, c) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta(z_t, t, c), \\Sigma_\\theta(z_t, t, c))$ (13)\nHere, c represents arbitrary conditioning information, enabling flexible control over the generation process.\nc) Cross-Attention Conditioning: Cross-attention serves as a crucial architectural component in Latent Diffusion Models, enabling the model to incorporate conditional information (such as text prompts or image features) during the denoising process. The mechanism operates within the UNet backbone of the model, specifically in the middle layers where the diffusion process occurs.\nThe cross-attention layer implements the following mathematical formulation:\n$\\text{CrossAttention}(z, c) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{(W_q z)(W_k c)^T}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)(W_v c)$ (14)\nwhere:\n*   z represents the latent features from the diffusion process\n*   c represents the conditioning information\n*   $W_q, W_k, W_v$ are learnable projection matrices\n*   d is the dimension of the key vectors\nDuring the denoising process at each timestep t, the UNet processes the noisy latent representation $z_t$ through multiple resnet blocks. At specific layers, cross-attention is applied as follows:\n$z_t' = \\text{LayerNorm}(z_t + \\text{CrossAttention}(z_t, c))$ (15)\nThis integration allows the model to condition the denoising process on external information. For instance, when generating images from text, the conditioning vector c would be derived from the text encoder:\nc = TextEncoder(text) (16)\nThe cross-attention mechanism effectively creates dynamic, content-dependent connections between the latent representations and the conditioning information. This allows the model to:\n$P_\\theta(z_{t-1}|z_t, c) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\theta(z_t, t, c), \\Sigma_\\theta(z_t, t, c))$ (17)\nwhere the mean and variance of the reverse process now explicitly depend on both the current noisy latent $z_t$ and the conditioning information c.\nThe attention weights computed through the softmax operation create a soft alignment between elements of the latent representation and the conditioning information. This alignment guides the denoising process by determining which aspects of the conditioning should influence different regions of the generated image. The process can be viewed as a series of guided denoising steps:\n$z_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_t}}\\left(x_t - \\frac{1 - a_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{a}_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta(z_t, t, c)\\right) + \\sigma \\epsilon$ (18)\nwhere the noise prediction network $\\epsilon_\\theta$ now has access to both temporal information t and conditioning information c through the cross-attention mechanism.\nd) Training Objective: The model is trained using a modified objective function that operates in the latent space:\n$L_{LDM} = \\mathbb{E}_{x(\\mathcal{x}), \\epsilon, t} [||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta(z_t, t)||^2]$ (19)\ne) Sampling Process: During inference, the model follows a reverse process:\n1) Sample $z_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$\n2) For t = T, ..., 1:\n$z_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a_t}}\\left(\\frac{1 - a_t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{a}_t}}\\epsilon_\\theta(z_t, t)\\right) + \\sigma \\epsilon$ (20)\n3) Decode final result: $x = \\mathcal{D}(z)$\nThis architecture has become the foundation for many modern image generation systems, including Stable Diffusion, demonstrating that operating in a learned latent space can maintain generation quality while significantly reducing computational requirements. The flexibility of the conditioning framework and the efficiency gains have made LDMs particularly suitable for practical applications in high-resolution image synthesis.\n3) Stable Diffusion and Variants:\na) Stable Diffusion by Stability AI: Stable Diffusion models, developed by Stability AI employ latent diffusion that operates in a lower-dimensional latent space rather than the high-dimensional pixel space. It significantly reduces the computational burden and enables high-resolution image generation. Stable Diffusion versions (SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, SD3.x) and enhanced models such as SDXL-Turbo and SD3-Turbo utilize various optimization and architectural innovations to achieve faster, high-fidelity generation with fewer inference steps. They represent a blend of computational efficiency and high-resolution output based on latent space operations, adversarial training, and architectural scaling to achieve state-of-the-art generative performance.\nStability AI has implemented several advancements to reduce sampling steps and improve fidelity. SDXL integrates a threefold increase in U-Net parameters and an improved text encoder, enhancing contextual comprehension. Additionally, multi-aspect ratio training and progressive size conditioning allow the model to generate images of varying resolutions effectively [39]. SDXL's refinement model applies further denoising steps in latent space, increasing visual fidelity by reducing noise artifacts. SDXL-Turbo implements Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD), which enables high-quality image generation in as few as one to four sampling steps and reduces computational demands. By integrating adversarial loss functions, SDXL-Turbo effectively mitigates common artifacts and blurriness associated with other distillation techniques, thereby improving image fidelity [40].\nSD3 introduces major enhancements in architecture, efficiency, and content control, significantly advancing over its predecessors. The model transitions from a traditional U-Net to a Diffusion Transformer architecture, using separate weights for image and language representations, which improves text comprehension and prompt adherence [41]. Enhanced text rendering now enables the generation of legible text within images, a notable improvement over prior versions. SD3 also incorporates multimodal input capabilities, allowing users to guide generation with text prompts combined with sketches or reference images, adding versatility to the creative process. Efficiency improvements include Rectified Flow sampling, which optimizes the path from noise to a clear image, as well as a novel noise schedule that samples more frequently in critical parts of the path, yielding higher-quality images. Additionally, SD3 provides scalability options, with models ranging from 800 million to 8 billion parameters, allowing users to balance computational requirements and output quality. The model also emphasizes safety, with mechanisms to prevent the generation of inappropriate content and options for artists to opt out of having their work used in training, addressing ethical concerns around content creation. Together, these upgrades establish SD3 as a powerful, flexible, and responsible tool in AI-driven image generation."}, {"title": "xtt \u2208 [e,T]", "content": "The SD3-Turbo model utilizes Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (LADD), which combines adversarial training with latent space distillation to speed up inference, achieving high-quality image generation with as few as four steps. LADD applies a distilled discriminator that learns directly in the latent space, avoiding high-dimensional RGB decoding [42].\nb) SDXL-Lightning: SDXL-Lightning is a novel diffusion distillation method for high-quality, one-step/few-step 1024px text-to-image generation. Building upon SDXL, SDXL-Lightning combines progressive and adversarial distillation to balance generation quality and mode coverage. Progressive distillation, where a student model learns to mimic multiple steps of a teacher model, ensures the student follows the teacher's probability flow. However, using a standard mean squared error (MSE) loss in prior work [43] results in blurry outputs due to the student's limited capacity to capture sharp transitions in the teacher's distribution. SDXL-Lightning incorporates adversarial training at each distillation stage. A discriminator D, which conditions on both the current latent $x_t$ and the teacher's multi-step prediction $X_{t-ns}$ is used to guide the student $z_{t-ns}$ to match the teacher's output distribution and maintain flow consistency. The discriminator uses the pre-trained SDXL U-Net encoder, enabling efficient operation in the latent space:\nD(xt, xt-ns,t,t ns, c) =\n$\\sigma$(head(d(xt-ns,tns, c),d(xt,t,c))) (21)\nwhere d represents the shared encoder and mid-block of the U-Net. The function head() is a small neural network consisting of convolutional layers, group normalization, and SiLU activations. It takes the concatenated output of d(xt-ns, t-ns, c) and d(xt, t, c) as input and projects it to a single scalar value between 0 and 1 using a final sigmoid activation \u03c3(\u00b7). This scalar represents the discriminator's confidence that the input Xt-ns originated from the teacher network. The adversarial loss functions are:\np = D(xt, Xt-ns, t, t - ns, c)\np = D(xt,xt-ns, t, t \u2013 ns, c)\nLD = - log(p) \u2013 log(1 \u2013 p)\nLG = - log(p) (22)\nTo further enhance semantic correctness, SDXL-Lightning relax the flow preservation constraint by finetuning with an unconditional objective. Additionally, researchers address flaws in common diffusion schedules [44] by using pure noise at t = T during training. Stable training techniques, including training at multiple timesteps and adding noise to discriminator inputs, are employed, especially for one and two-step models. Our models are available as both LoRA and full UNet weights, offering flexibility for integration and fine-tuning.\n4) Consistency Models: A core concept in Consistency Models is the idea of a consistency function derived from the probability flow ODE of continuous-time diffusion models. Given a trajectory of a probability flow ODE, denoted as $x_{tt} \\in [\\epsilon,T]$, where $x_\\epsilon$ represents the data and $x_T$ represents noise, the consistency function $f : (x_t,t) \\rightarrow x_\\epsilon$ maps any point (x,t) on this trajectory to its origin $x_\\epsilon$. A Consistency Model, denoted as $f_\\theta$, aims to learn this consistency function. A key property of consistency functions, and thus Consistency Models, is self-consistency: any two points on the same probability flow trajectory should map to the same initial point, i.e., $f(x_t,t) = f (x_{t'},t')$ for all t,t' \u2208 [e,T].\n5) Imagen Models: Google's Imagen models are text-to-image generation systems that utilize diffusion-based architectures. The original Imagen model enables creation of high-fidelity images closely aligned with the provided text prompts by using a cascaded diffusion process, progressively generating images from low to high resolution, conditioned on textual descriptions [14]. Subsequent iterations, such as Imagen 2 [45] and Imagen 3 [46], have introduced enhancements to the diffusion framework. These improvements include better handling of complex prompts, more accurate rendering of human features, and the ability to generate higher-resolution images. The models maintain a diffusion-based methodology, refining the process to achieve greater detail and realism in the generated images\n6) DALL-E Models: The DALL-E model series by OpenAI emphasize the use of large-scale language-image alignment to generate coherent and contextually appropriate images from text prompts. DALL-E 1 was the first large-scale model specifically designed to generate images from text prompts. It used a transformer-based architecture, similar to models like GPT, to create images in a step-by-step manner, generating one part of the image at a time, much like forming words in a sentence [15]. To convert image regions into sequences of tokens, DALL-E 1 employed a discrete variational autoencoder (dVAE), allowing it to generate tokens sequentially based on the text prompt to form a complete image. For improved alignment between text and image, DALL-E 1 uses representations from CLIP, a model trained to understand text-image relationships [18] to help evaluate and rank the images. However, despite this alignment, the token-based approach limited scalability and coherence, especially when generating complex or highly detailed scenes.\nDALL-E 2 generates images from text prompts using a two-stage process, starting from converting a text description into an image embedding, a sort of blueprint that captures the main visual concept. Such embedding is created with the help of CLIP, a model that aligns images and text in a shared space, making it possible to interpret complex descriptions [47]. Next, DALL-E 2 uses a diffusion model to convert this embedding into a high-quality image, gradually refining it until the final picture emerges [13]. This setup allows DALL-E 2 to generate detailed, realistic images that closely match the given text. DALL-E 3 significantly improves the accuracy and detail of text-to-image generation, closely following complex prompts to create images that better align with user instructions. It is built upon DALL-E 2's two-stage structure by enhancing understanding of nuanced or detailed text inputs, making it capable of handling more complex scenarios (legible text within images or rendering intricate visual elements) [48]. DALL-E 3 integrates with ChatGPT, which allows users to refine images interactively through conversational feedback."}, {"title": "C. Consistency Models for Efficient Image Generation", "content": "Consistency Models (CMs) represent a different paradigm in generative modeling, which addresses the computational inefficiencies inherent in diffusion models while maintaining high-quality generation capabilities [49]. Unlike diffusion models that require multiple denoising steps, CMs enable efficient image generation through a mathematical framework that ensures consistency across noise levels.\n1) Theoretical Foundation: The principle of consistency ensures that the model maintains stable outputs across equivalent noise transformations. Let X \u2286 RD denote the data space, and consider a noise distribution N(0, max). The Consistency Model is defined as a mapping fo : RD XR RD parameterized by 0, which satisfies:\n$f_\\theta(x_t,t) = f_\\theta(x_{t'}, t')$ (23)\nwhere $x_t, x_{t'} \\in X$ represent images at different noise levels t, t'. This property ensures that outputs remain invariant under noise transformations, promoting structural stability during generation [50].\n2) Mathematical Framework: The consistency property is enforced through a carefully designed training objective. Let Pdata(x) represent the data distribution and T denote a time sampling strategy over [0, 1]. The loss function is defined as:\n$L_{consistency} = E_{x\\sim p_{data},t_1,t_2\\sim T}\n[||sg(f_\\theta(x,t_1)) \u2013 f_\\theta(x, t_2)||^2]$ (24)\nwhere sg represents the stop-gradient operator. The time sampling strategy T is designed to focus on regions where the model's outputs are most sensitive to noise, improving learning efficiency.\n3) Efficiency Mechanism: The remarkable efficiency of Consistency Models stems from three key innovations:\n*   Direct Mapping: Instead of iterative denoising, CMs learn a direct mapping from noisy to clean images, significantly reducing computational overhead.\n*   Consistency Distillation: The model distills knowledge across different noise levels, enabling faster inference while maintaining generation quality.\n*   Adaptive Sampling: The framework allows for flexible sampling strategies, where the number of steps can be adjusted based on computational constraints without retraining.\nThe practical benefits are substantial, including reduced inference time compared to traditional diffusion models, lower memory requirements during both training and inference, improved stability in the generation process, and maintenance of high-quality outputs despite fewer computational steps.\nRecent work has demonstrated that CMs can achieve comparable or superior performance to diffusion models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources [49]. This efficiency makes them particularly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale deployment scenarios.\n4) Extensions and Applications: Recent developments have extended the basic CM framework in several directions:\n*   Conditional Generation: Incorporating conditioning information while maintaining the consistency property\n*   Multi-scale Generation: Applying consistency across different spatial resolutions\n*   Hybrid Approaches: Combining consistency models with other generative frameworks for enhanced performance\nThese advances have made Consistency Models increasingly attractive for practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research in efficient image generation."}, {"title": "III.

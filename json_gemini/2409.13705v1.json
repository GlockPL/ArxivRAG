We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) (Awasthi et al., 2020) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset (Markov et al., 2023), and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety (Table 1); we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The rapid growth in the capabilities of LLMs have powered their use in chatbots, search, content creation, etc. As these models become more available, it is important to have guardrails to protect against adversarial or jailbreaking inputs and policy violating outputs of LLMs. Several content moderation APIs such as Perspective API\u00b9, OpenAI Content Moderation API\u00b2, and Azure Content Safety API\u00b3,"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Counterfactual Fairness Counterfactual metrics (Kusner et al., 2017) (Smith et al., 2022) measure fairness by considering hypothetical scenarios where sensitive attributes are altered, providing insights into the causal relationship between attributes and outcomes. In this work, we counterfactually balance our evaluation set to have a similar data distribution across subgroups. This leads to group fairness metrics across slices correlating better with counterfactual fairness. While traditionally counterfactual fairness is associated with individual fairness (Dwork et al., 2012), this approach brings it closer to group fairness metrics like equality of odds (Garg et al., 2019) that demands equal rates of outcomes across sensitive"}, {"title": "Bias Mitigation", "content": "Several studies have explored mitigating model biases via data reweighting. While some of these works apply mitigation in-training such as iteratively reweighting samples based on training losses (Fan et al., 2018; Petrovic et al., 2020) or optimization of fairness metrics (Jiang et al., 2018), simple two-stage training approaches that train a baseline and use it's fairness performance to reweight training datasets have proven quite effective (Liu et al., 2021). We adopt a similar two-stage technique called Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) (Awasthi et al., 2020), that reweights data proportional to the level of bias across subgroups as exhibited by a preliminary model trained on the data, and we adapt FDW to mitigate counterfactual biases. FRAPPE (Tifrea et al.) is another post-processing method that trains a fairer module post-hoc without changes to the original model. Our approach shares a similar motivation to FRAPPE but differs in the approach by ensembling and debiasing several source models as well as the notion of bias we correct for."}, {"title": "Problem Set Up", "content": "Terminology In this paper, Identity categories refers to the broad categorization of individuals based on aspects of human identity (e.g Race, Religion). Subgroups refer to the further division within each identity category (e.g., 'Jewish' is a subgroup that belongs to the identity category of \u2018Religion') (See Table 2 for an overview of identity categories and subgroups considered in this work).\nMetrics We propose two quantitative metrics to measure counterfactual fairness that pinpoint model biases across identity categories and subgroups respectively: Average Counterfactual Variance (ACV) and Sliced Averages (SA). Note that our evaluation set comprises of multiple counterfactual sets, and each counterfactual set is a collection of examples that only differ with respect to subgroups (e.g. 'what is a good chinese restaurant?' 'what is a good indian restaurant?\u201d, \u2018what is a good italian restaurant?\u2019).\nAverage Counterfactual Variance ACV is a broad measure which reveals problematic identity categories for a harm category. We compute the variance of model predictions for a given counterfactual set, and average those variances across all counterfactual sets in our data. The lower the ACV, the more consistent the predictions are across counterfactuals. Formally, if $C_i$ represents the set of pre-"}, {"title": null, "content": "dictions from a classifier $f$ for the $i^{th}$ counterfactual set (with $N$ total counterfactual sets), such that for an input $i_j$, $C_{i_1} = f(i_j)$ and $C_i = \\{C_{i1}, ..C_{in}\\}$, we have $ACV = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i Var(C_i)$.\nSliced Averages SA reveals the problematic subgroups within each identity category that the model is most biased against (an example of a slice is gender = X). We report the average model scores per subgroup conditioned on the ground truth of a harm category. The Sliced Average for a set of examples $E_{s,gt}$ that belong to a subgroup $s \\in S$, and harm type $h$ conditioned on the ground truth $gt \\in \\{Safe, Unsafe\\}$ is simply $SA(s|h = gt) = \\frac{1}{|E_{s,gt}|} \\sum_{e \\in E_{s,gt}} f(e)$."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Dataset Creation We introduce two novel techniques for crafting datasets using PaLM API (Anil et al., 2023).\nGenerating new prompt-level datasets: Inspired by AART's attribute-based generation (Radharapu et al., 2023), we developed a templated approach to cover new themes and instructions that encompass diverse use cases and identities, addressing both harmful and non-harmful themes. This flexible method allows users to tailor datasets to specific identity groups (see Appendix A.2 for details).\nDiversifying existing response-level datasets: To tackle the lack of identity diversity in existing safety datasets (Markov et al., 2023; Jigsaw, 2018), we employ LLMs to rewrite text to inject diverse identity contexts (A.2.2) that were absent in the original datasets. For instance, if the identity \u201cHindu\u201d was not represented, we might change \"My Muslim friend went to mosque\u201d to \u201cMy Hindu friend went to temple\". We counterfactualise with the set of identities mentioned in (Smith et al., 2022), utilize Chain-of-Thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) to ensure these changes are targeted and identity-focused.\nFair Data Reweighting (FDW) FDW (Awasthi et al., 2020) produces a fairness-informed resampling of the training dataset without impacting the model architecture. Using SA evaluation of the baseline model per subgroup slice as a proxy for model fairness, FDW resamples training examples from these slices proportional to the level of bias. A model trained on this resampled training set with the same architecture as the baseline model should observe a reduction in the gap between SA of slices, thereby making it a fairer model."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "In this section, we showcase debiasing on two harms: Hate and Violence. We use a random forest classifier as our ensemble with 34 numeric input features and 4 outputs (see Table 1). For training, testing, and validation, we use a combination of Open AI and LLM-generated datasets. We use a baseline of the ensemble trained on source model features computed on the pre-counterfactualized (\"original\") train set. An ensemble trained on top of raw model scores provides a computationally efficient way to re-use the rich semantic information encoded in these scores from the source transformer models. Choice of a random forest model was also motivated by enhanced interpretability and improved model robustness without the need for extensive feature engineering.\nTo identify potential biases in our source models, we compute the SA metric for every output attribute from the source models. Disproportionately high scores for a subgroup per identity category serve as indicators of potential biases in individual source model attributes. Analysis of all such attributes (Figure 5) revealed biases in sensitive_topic and identity_attack, both exhibiting substantial score gaps across subgroups. For example, Fig. 3 shows the identity_attack scores being disproportionately higher for the 'Black' subgroup for safe"}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "While our debiasing technique is quick and inexpensive, the fairness gains may be bounded by the quality of the source classifiers. For more complex biases, mitigating the source models may be needed. Additionally, since our debiasing method does not vary the input features or add new training data (apart from counterfactuals), there may be trade-offs between optimizing for Safe vs Unsafe examples, albeit controlled by hyperparameters. In this study, we focus on the English language, we plan to test on more languages in the future.

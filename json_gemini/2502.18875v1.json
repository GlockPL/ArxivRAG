Proteolysis-targeting chimeras\n(PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are the primary small molecules that\ninduce TPD. Both types of molecules form a ternary complex linking an E3 ubiquitin\nligase with a target protein, a crucial step for drug discovery. While significant advances\nhave been made in in-silico binary structure prediction for proteins and small molecules,\nternary structure prediction remains challenging due to obscure interaction mechanisms\nand insufficient training data. Traditional methods relying on manually assigned rules per-\nform poorly and are computationally demanding due to extensive random sampling. In\nthis work, we introduce DeepTernary, a novel deep learning-based approach that directly\npredicts ternary structures in an end-to-end manner using an encoder-decoder architec-\nture. DeepTernary leverages an SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN) with both\nintra-graph and ternary inter-graph attention mechanisms to capture intricate ternary\ninteractions from our collected high-quality training dataset, TernaryDB.

Traditional drug discovery mainly\nfocuses on inhibiting the activity of target proteins, which may not always be effective, espe-\ncially in cases where the target protein is 'undruggable' by occupancy-driven inhibitors like\nsmall molecules [5]. These 'undruggable' proteins include oncology targets in the SWI/SNF\ncomplex [6, 7] and many kinases [8] which share high homology active domain with their\nessential non-disease related family members, and transcriptional factors [9] that are highly\nunstructured until they form active conformations. TPD presents an alternative strategy, which\nis to induce the degradation of target proteins rather than inhibit their activity to achieve\ndesirable therapeutic outcomes. The mode of action (MOA) for TPD offers several advantages:\nFirstly, TPD molecules do not require targeting 'active site', allowing them to selectively tar-\nget disease-driver proteins without affecting other essential homologous proteins that often\nshare conserved active sites, and exert potential to engage highly-unstructured transcriptional\nfactors [10] and other scaffolding targets that do not depend on active sites [10]. Secondly,\nits transient protein interaction via event-driven mechanism reduces the reliance on strong\nbinding affinity, in contrast to inhibitor drugs [11]. Furthermore, its catalytic nature miti-\ngates the requirement for high dosages and the subsequent challenges associated with off-target\neffects [12]. Lastly, even for existing targetable proteins by inhibitors, it still offers alternative\ntherapeutic options to fight against drug resistance caused by active site mutations [13].\nProteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders (MGDs) are two\nmain modes of TPD [11]. As shown in Fig. 1a, PROTACs are hetero-bifunctional small\nmolecules consisting of three moieties, including a warhead, which is the ligand of the protein\nof interest (POI), an anchor, which is the ligand of an E3 ubiquitin ligase being employed, and\na linker linking the warhead and anchor. With the hetero-bifunctional structure, PROTACS\nrecruit the POI to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the ubiquitination of the POI and its sub-\nsequent degradation process by UPS [2, 14]. As of January 2023, there have been 18 PROTACS\nunder evaluation by regulatory authorities, targeting different malignant cancer diseases [15].\nMGDs, in contrast, are small molecules that facilitate the interaction between the POI and\nan E3 ubiquitin ligase, enabling the ubiquitination and degradation processes of the POI [16].\nUnlike PROTACs, they do not require a bifunctional structure but act by stabilizing exist-\ning protein-protein interactions or inducing new interactions [17]. Despite their distinct modes\nof action, both PROTACs and MG(D)s share a common feature: the induction of a ternary\ncomplex structure that is crucial for their respective mechanisms.\nUnderstanding the ternary structure induced by PROTACs or MGDs provides crucial\ninsights into the molecular basis of induced protein degradation. In the context of PROTACs,\nthe ternary structure elucidates how the PROTAC molecule facilitates the connection between\nthe POI and the E3 ligase, demonstrating the interacting poses, properties of the contact inter-\nface, and solvent-exposed amino acid residues essential for efficient ubiquitination. For instance,\nthe buried surface area (BSA) of the ternary structure [18] is a critical parameter indicating\nthe extent of interaction surface between the PROTAC, the POI, and the E3 ligase, directly\ncorrelating with the stability and efficacy of the induced degradation [17, 19]. The ternary\nstructure can also suggest possible modifications in terms of the length and the composition of\nthe PROTAC linker in order to improve selectivity and reduce off-target effects [19]. Similar to\nPROTACS, the BSA of the MGD-induced ternary structure is a crucial determinant of their\nfunctional impact, influencing both the strength and specificity of the interaction between the\nPOI and the E3 ligase [17], which can also provide clues about the molecular features that are\ncrucial for the molecular glue's activity [20].\nExisting experimental approaches to obtain the PROTAC- or MGD-induced ternary struc-\ntures, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, often depend on costly instrumentation\nand intricate reagents and remain a formidable challenge for seasoned structural biologists\ndue to the necessity of high-purity proteins and precise buffer conditions. Instead, in silico\napproaches have been proposed to predict ternary structures that primarily using various dock-\ning methods (such as PatchDock [21, 22], FRODock [23, 24], RosettaDock [22, 24, 25], and\nPIPER [19, 26, 27]) to generate big pools of structures and then to rank, filter, and refine\nthe docked ternary structures by minimizing free energy [19, 22, 27], atom clash [27\u201329], con-\nstraining distance to E2 ligase [27], and molecular dynamics simulations [19]. In spite of the\nencouraging progress, the structures predicted by existing docking methods still deviate greatly\nfrom experimentally determined ones, and the docking process is usually time-consuming.\nRecently, deep learning technologies such as AlphaFold2 [30] and RosettaFold [31] have shown\npromising prediction accuracy for protein structure prediction by making use of deep and\nsophisticated neural networks to distill crucial features from extensive training datasets. These\nremarkable achievements have attracted significant scientific interest in extending deep learning\nto other related tasks, including protein-protein [32, 33] and protein-ligand complex structure\nprediction [34, 35]. However, to our best knowledge, there were no reported research on pre-\ndicting PROTAC- or MGD-induced ternary structures by using deep learning approaches. This\ncan be attributed to the heightened complexity of modeling ternary structures compared to\nthe unitary or binary structures tackled in prior studies. Additionally, the scarcity of training\ndata presents a significant obstacle to training deep learning models, as there are only a few\nresolved ternary structures for both PROTACs and MGDs [17, 36], making it impractical to\ntrain such models with such limited data."}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning-based framework for predicting ternary\ncomplexes induced by PROTACs and MG(D)s\u00b9. This represents the first attempt to apply deep\nlearning to PROTAC structure prediction and the first in silico approach for MG(D) struc-\nture prediction. To achieve this, we curated TernaryDB, a large-scale dataset comprising over\n20,000 ternary complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The dataset focuses on high-\nquality complexes that include a small molecule and two proteins while deliberately excluding\nknown PROTACs and MG(D)s from the training list. Fig. 1b outlines the construction process\nof the dataset. Leveraging TernaryDB, we trained DeepTernary, an SE(3)-equivariant graph\nneural network specifically designed for ternary structure prediction (Fig. 1c). In this model,\nthe ternary complexes were disassembled into three components\u2014p1 (protein1), lig (ligand),\nand p2 (protein2)\u2014each modeled as a graph. Graph neural networks(GNN) [37] offer a pow-\nerful framework for processing graph-structured data through message passing between nodes\nand edges. To improve data efficiency, we employed an SE(3)-equivariant GNN, leveraging\nthe symmetry properties of SE(3) to ensure invariance to the translation and rotation of 3D\nstructures. Additionally, we introduced a novel ternary inter-graph attention mechanism to cap-\nture the intricate relationships between ternary components, along with a query-based pocket\npoints decoder to predict the final complex structure. With these innovations, DeepTernary\neffectively predicts both the conformation of the small molecule and the docking poses of the\nternary complex. DeepTernary was evaluated against existing PROTAC and MG(D) bench-\nmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with DockQ scores of 0.65 and 0.21, with average\ninference times of approximately 7 seconds and 1 second, respectively. The model's ability\nto generalize from a non-PROTAC/MG(D) PDB dataset to PROTAC/MG(D) ternary struc-\ntures highlights its capacity to capture the fundamental interaction patterns governing ternary\ncomplex formation, rather than relying on memorization. Moreover, the predicted buried sur-\nface area (BSA) of the PROTAC complexes aligns closely with values reported in existing\nliterature, with BSA ranging from 1100 to 1500, indicating high degradation potential. These\nresults demonstrate DeepTernary's potential to advance our understanding and manipulation\nof protein degradation mechanisms.\nThere are only a few dozen experimentally determined PROTAC- and MG(D)-involved ternary\ncomplexes in the PDB [39]. Despite the remarkable success of deep learning in protein struc-\nture prediction [30, 31], protein-protein docking [32], and protein-ligand interactions [34, 40],\nits application to targeted protein degradation (TPD) remains underdeveloped, primarily due\nto the scarcity of training data. We hypothesized that TPD complexes adhere to the same\nfundamental atom-interaction principles as other tripartite complexes. To test this hypothesis\nand enable deep learning-based prediction of TPD complex structures, we curated a compre-\nhensive dataset of ternary complexes from the PDB. After stringent data filtering (details are\nprovided in Methods 4), the final dataset comprised 22,303 complexes, with their key attributes\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The distribution of ligand atom counts, excluding hydrogens, is shown in\nFig. 2b, revealing that the majority of ligands contain fewer than 60 heavy atoms, with only\na small subset exceeding 100. The chemical diversity of these ligands, represented by Mor-\ngan fingerprints (Fig. 2f), highlights the broad chemical space and drug-like properties of the\ndataset. Proteins from 363 species, ranging from bacteria to humans, are included in the dataset\n(Fig. 2d). Although the protein space is relatively sparse, it adequately covers PROTAC- and\nMG(D)-induced proteins (Fig. 2e).\nTo rigorously assess our method, we integrated known PROTAC and MG(D) ternary com-\nplexes into the test sets. To prevent data leakage, we utilized MMseqs2 [41] to cluster the\ndataset based on protein sequence similarity. Clusters containing known PROTAC or MG(D)\ncomplexes were excluded from the training set and served as a validation set, ensuring no\noverlap between training and test data. This clustering approach yielded 16,203 complexes\ndistributed across 1,398 clusters for PROTACs and 22,046 complexes across 1,982 clusters for\nMG(D)s. The distribution of cluster sizes is shown in Fig. 2c, where most clusters are small,\nalthough a few contain over 100 complexes.\nTo mitigate potential biases during training, we adopted a cluster-wise sampling strategy.\nTraditional uniform sampling within batches could result in the selection of highly similar\ncomplexes, thereby skewing the training process. Instead, we first randomly sampled a cluster\nwith equal probability and then selected the representative complex with a 20% likelihood;\notherwise, a random complex from the cluster was chosen. The representative complex was\ndetermined using the MMseqs2 toolkit during clustering. This approach ensures a diverse and\nrepresentative sampling of the training data, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across\ncomplex structures.\nDeepTernary is designed to predict the structures of small molecule-induced ternary com-\nplexes, such as those formed by PROTACs and MG(D)s-induced E3 ligase with POI complexes.\nUnlike existing methods that rely on standard protein-protein docking programs to approxi-\nmate the interaction between two proteins often neglecting the presence of small molecules,\nDeepTernary employs a deep neural network to directly learn the intricate dynamics of\nprotein-protein and protein-ligand interactions within ternary complexes. For predicting\nPROTAC-induced complexes, DeepTernary takes as inputs the respective mono forms of the\ntwo protein structures (E3 ligase and target protein) along with docked warheads and anchors\nfrom other PDB entries (unbound structures), in addition to the PROTAC Simplified Molec-\nular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings. In the case of MG(D)-induced complexes,\nsince the unbound structures are hard to find, we adopt the respective in-complex form of\nthe two protein structures (randomly rotated and transformed) and the corresponding MG(D)\nSMILES strings as input.\nIn general, DeepTernary consists of an encoder and a decoder. The process begins by\ngenerating a random conformation of the small molecule using RDKIT [42] and randomly\ndisplacing the small molecule and protein 2 (p2) away from protein 1 (p1). This serves as"}, {"title": "Effectiveness of model designs", "content": "Based on the binary interaction prediction model [32, 34], we had explored various choices of\nmodel designs and hyper-parameters for DeepTernary. To ensure robust model selection, we\nemployed a validation set consisting of curated structures that are dissimilar to the training\nset and also not in the test set. Model performance on this validation set was assessed using a\nsimple score calculated as the average of the DockQ scores for the top-ranked prediction and\nthe best overall prediction (detailed information is provided in Supplementary Section A.1).\nWe now present the results obtained on the test set.\nFirst, DeepTernary incorporates a ternary inter-graph attention mechanism in the encoder,\nenabling it to capture more complex ternary interactions. However, the initial decoder design,\ndenoted as IEGMN, struggled to effectively translate the encoded information into accurate\nbinding poses (Fig. 3a). By introducing the newly developed Prompt-based Pocket Points\nDecoder (PPPD) (detailed in Methods 4), we significantly enhanced performance, with many\nsamples achieving medium to high quality (DockQ > 0.49). Additionally, we found that, while\nmulti-head attention is beneficial in natural language processing, it is less effective for pre-\ndicting pocket point coordinates in this context. Specifically, as the number of attention heads\nincreases, the DockQ score decreases slightly (Fig. 3b). Consequently, we employed single-head\nattention in the PPPD to extract coordinates accurately. Transitioning from binary to ternary\ninteraction prediction posed additional challenges. We discovered that increasing the latent\nembedding space improved the model's capacity to learn complex triplet interactions, particu-\nlarly for MG(D) complexes, which exhibit greater structural complexity (Fig. 3c). Besides, to\navoid the risk of overfitting, we increased the noise added to both the coordinates and latent\nfeatures, from 1 to 2, which improved performance across both PROTAC and MG(D) bench-\nmarks (Fig. 3d). Nevertheless, adding too much noise (noise level from 2 to 3) will hinder the\nperformance.\nIn line with previous studies [24, 27, 36], DeepTernary utilizes RDKit [42] to generate\ninitial conformations for small molecules, sampling multiple conformations with different seed\nnumbers during inference. Our ablation studies (Fig. 3e) demonstrated that both the DockQ\nscore and accept rate (DockQ > 0.23) increased as the number of sampled conformations for\nPROTAC grew. Conversely, MG(D) complexes showed little change. This discrepancy can be\nattributed to the fact that PROTACs have more atoms and exhibit greater structural flexibility,\nwhile MG(D)s have a smaller conformation space. Based on these findings, we sample 40\ninitial random conformations for each PROTAC and rank the predicted results using the PAE\nscore. For MG(D) predictions, we use a single initial conformation to conserve computational\nresources."}, {"title": "DeepTernary achieves the highest accuracy in PROTACs-induced\nternary structure prediction", "content": "To evaluate our method, we utilized the PROTAC benchmark compiled by Rao et al. [36], which\nconsists of 22 known PROTAC-induced ternary structures serving as the test set. The unbound\nprotocol adopted in this benchmark emulates the real-world scenario encountered during drug\ndiscovery, where the experimental structure of the ternary complex is often unavailable. In this\nprotocol, an unbound complex refers to a protein with a bounded ligand similar to the warhead\nor anchor of the PROTAC, but not co-crystallized with the entire PROTAC molecule. To align\nwith the rational design process of PROTACS, we followed this unbound protocol to evaluate\nDeepTernary.\nTo mitigate data leakage, we excluded any similar protein pairs from the dataset used\nto train our model. Unlike previous methods, which rely on human-defined heuristics \u2013 such\nas manually set thresholds for free energy [19, 22, 27], atom clashes [27\u201329], or linker ends\ndistances [27] \u2013 to filter ternary conformations, we leveraged deep learning to automatically\ncapture high-dimensional interactions between PROTACs and proteins. Furthermore, in con-\ntrast to Drummond et al. [28, 29], our model was trained without any PROTAC-involved\nstructures and directly evaluated on the PROTAC benchmark, using a zero-shot protocol. This\napproach tests the model's ability to learn general interaction rules applicable to any ternary\nstructure, not just those induced by PROTACs, offering a stringent measure of how well the\nmodel generalizes from non-PROTAC to PROTAC data.\nFor a comprehensive comparison, we employed several evaluation metrics, including DockQ\nscores, rank of the first prediction achieving a DockQ score greater than 0.23, the percentage\nof CAPRI high/medium/acceptable predictions, and the percentage of predictions with RMSD\n< 10 \u00c5 (metrics detailed in Evaluation metrics). As shown in Fig. 4a, b, and c, DeepTernary\nconsistently produces higher DockQ scores and higher rates of acceptable predictions (both\nin terms of High/Medium/Acceptable predictions and < 10 \u00c5) compared to other published\nmethods, including FRODock- and RosettaDock-Based methods [24], BOTCP [36], Method\n4 [28], Method 4B [29], PRosettaC [22], and most recently published AlphaFold 3 [43] and Chai-1\n[44]. Specifically, it achieved an average DockQ score of 0.65 across the test set, significantly\noutperforming the recently proposed BOTCP [36], which scored 0.44. Although other methods\nwere only evaluated on subsets of the benchmark, DeepTernary demonstrated superior per-\nformance across overlapping tested structures. Notably, as illustrated in the lower portion of\nFig. 4a, DeepTernary surpasses the top-performing RosettaDock-based method [24] for most\ntesting structures.\nPROTAC molecules, with their larger atom counts compared to natural small molecules,\nexhibit diverse conformations due to their significant degrees of freedom. To model this flexi-\nbility, we employed the RDKit toolkit to generate multiple initial conformations of the ligand\nusing different random seeds, each of which was input into our model. To estimate the predic-\ntion quality, we introduced a predicted aligned error (PAE), allowing us to rank the predicted\nresults and select the most confident output. With an average rank of 4.06 under 40 seeds\n(Fig. 4a, middle panel), DeepTernary reliably generated acceptable predictions (DockQ > 0.23).\nIn another words, there is generally at least one acceptable prediction within the top four\nresults. To compare with existing methods, we also calculate the prediction success rate for\neach complex based on another two criteria: CAPRI criteria and RMSD < 10 \u00c5 (Fig. 4b and\nc). As we can see, DeepTernary significantly improve the success rate to around 50%, which\nmeans for most of the test complexes, more than half of the predictions are above acceptable\nquality. Since the ground-truth structure is typically unavailable in practice, distinguishing\nbetween higher- and lower-quality output structures remains challenging without of a reliable\nscoring or ranking system. Our DeepTernary addresses this challenge by incorporating a PAE\npredictor, where lower PAE values indicate higher confidence in predictions (Fig. A2). The\nmean Top-1 DockQ based on PAE reaches up to 0.4 (Tab. A5), surpassing the acceptable cutoff\nof 0.23, which enhances its utility in real-world drug discovery applications.\nFinally, we examined the performance of DeepTernary across the three distinct E3 lig-\nases present in the 22 benchmark complexes. As shown in Fig. 4d, DeepTernary consistently\nachieved desirable DockQ scores across all ligases, highlighting its robustness and generalizabil-\nity. Visual comparisons of the predicted and experimentally determined structures (Fig. 4e-f)\ndemonstrate that our model can generate high-quality predictions, with DockQ values exceed-\ning 0.9. Notably, for PDB IDs 6W70 and 6W8I, which share the same E3 ligase and POI\npair but differ in their PROTACS, DeepTernary accurately captured the structural differences,\nproducing predictions aligned with experimental expectations."}, {"title": "DeepTernary reaches acceptable accuracy in MG(D)-induced ternary\ncomplex structure prediction", "content": "Molecular glue degraders (MGDs) represent a novel class of TPD drugs, distinct from PRO-\nTACs due to their lower molecular weight and alternative MOA. These characteristics often\nresult in an advantageous starting point for medicinal chemistry optimization, as well as\nenhanced drug-like physicochemical properties [45]. Their simplicity in structure further\nfacilitates later-stage drug development. The rising interest in MGDs has prompted signifi-\ncant research efforts and corporate investments focused on this new modality. In particular,\nstructure-based rational design plays a crucial role in maximizing the chances of successful\ndrug discovery. For instance, the crystal structure of the B-TrCP, \u03b2-catenin, and NRX-1933\nternary complex has been instrumental in developing MGDs with improved mutant selectiv-\nity [46]. Similarly, the discovery of ALV2, a mutant-specific Ikaros degrader, relied on known\ncrystal structures for guidance [47, 48].\nMG(D)s can either stabilize endogenous protein-protein interactions or induce non-native\nones [49]. However, predicting MG(D)-induced ternary complex structures poses a challenge\ndue to the often weak binding affinity between the small molecule and one of the proteins. With\nno existing in silico method specifically designed for MG(D)-induced complexes, we employed\nEquiDock [32], a protein-protein docking approach, to test whether weak interactions between\ntwo proteins could approximate MG(D)-induced binding features. Using MG(D)-induced com-\nplexes collected by Rui et al. [17] as a test set, we evaluated the models' performance using\nDockQ scores, similar to our approach with PROTAC experiments. The results, shown in\nFig. 5a, reveal that EquiDock achieves an average DockQ score of only 0.04. In contrast,\nDeepTernary significantly improves the score to 0.21, demonstrating the advantage of incor-\nporating small molecule information and modeling ternary interactions within the model\narchitecture.\nRecently, DeepMind introduced AlphaFold3 (AF3) [43], which is able to predict complexes\ninvolving nearly all molecular types in the PDB, including proteins and small molecules. How-\never, since the code has not yet been released and the AlphaFold Server does not currently\nallow customization of small molecules, we used AF3 solely for protein-protein binding pre-\ndictions, as we did with EquiDock. Fig. 5b illustrates a prediction for PDB ID 7BQU, where\nAF3, thought better than EquiDock, performs significantly worse than DeepTernary, which\npredicts a structure closest to the co-crystallized ground truth (green vs. gray). We show the\nPAE matrix in the top right corner. The PAE in AlphaFold, measured in \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms (\u00c5), repre-\nsents the expected positional error between two residues in the predicted structure. Typically,\nan AF PAE value exceeding 15 \u00c5 is considered indicative of a less confident prediction. In this\nprediction, the PAE values are approximately 20 \u00c5, highlights AF3's lower confidence in this\npredicted interaction.\nRui et al. categorized the collected MG(D)-induced complexes into two groups based on the\nnature of their protein-protein interface: Group 1 involves domain-domain interactions, where\ntwo proteins bind through well-structured domains (as shown in Fig. 5d), and Group 2 involves\nsequence motif-domain interactions, where a protein sequence motif binds to a structured\ndomain (illustrated in Fig. 5c). Our results indicate that both EquiDock and DeepTernary\nperform better on Group 2 complexes than on Group 1, as shown in Fig. 5e. This suggests\nthat the large, well-folded domains in Group 1 complexes involve more complex binding rules,\nwhich may not be adequately covered by the training set (Supplementary Fig. A3). In contrast,\nthe interactions involving small recognition motifs in Group 2 are better captured, leading to\nimproved predictions."}, {"title": "The total buried surface area (BSA) from our predicted structures\nstrongly correlates with degradation potency", "content": "Experimental work by Wurz et al.

Their findings revealed that BSA\nhas a negative correlation with In(KLPT), while a lower KLPT corresponds to higher degra-\ndation potency. In other words, a higher BSA corresponds to higher degradation potency. To\ntest whether our predicted ternary structures could reflect this relationship, we calculated the\ntotal BSA for the predicted VHL-PROTAC-SMARCA2 complexes (Fig. 6b). Consistent with\nthe experimental data, our predictions also show a generally negative correlation between total\nBSA and In(KLPT), supporting the findings of Wurz et al.\nIn a separate study, Zorba et al. [50] investigated the effect of PROTAC linker length\non degradation potency, using cereblon (CRBN) as the E3 ligase to induce degradation of\nBruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). They synthesized 11 PROTACs with varying linker lengths\n(PROTACS 1-11) and found that longer PROTACs (6-11) yield detectable ternary complex\nformation via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and demonstrated potent cellular\nBTK degradation.

This approach, while effective, is time-consuming, taking\napproximately one hour on an 18-core CPU for the FRODOCK-based process alone, with\nRosettaDock-based refinement adding another nine hours.

Unlike\ntraditional docking-based techniques that rely on iterative candidate generation and refine-\nment, DeepTernary predicts PROTAC ternary structures in a fraction of the time. Using 40\nseeds, it can predict a ternary complex in just 12.37 seconds on a 15-core CPU, and as lit-\ntle as 6.48 seconds with GPU acceleration. For MG(D) complexes, the process is even faster,\nrequiring only a single forward pass of the embedded graphs, yielding results in under 1 sec-\nond (Fig. 6e).

By refining this\nframework and integrating additional structural data, we anticipate even greater contributions\nto the field of targeted protein degradation."}, {"title": "4 Methods", "content": "In our quest to identify potential ternary complexes, We searched the Protein Data Bank\n(PDB) to extract potential ternary complexes, applying filters to select structures with at least\ntwo proteins and more than one small molecule. This initial filtration process yielded 46,797\npotential PDB entries. Subsequently, the filtered candidates were further refined by selecting\nonly X-ray structures that met our high-quality standards-specifically, those with a resolution\nof 3.5 \u00c5 or better and an R-free value of 0.26 or lower thereby refining our dataset to 22,221\nPDB IDs.\nFrom these entries, we extracted 42,441 ternary complexes, some of which included multiple\ncomplexes within a single entry, such as assemblies (e.g., 5T35_D_A_759 and 5T35_H_E_759) and\ninstances where different ligands interacted with the same protein pair (e.g., 6ZO8_B_C_LPX\nand 6ZO8_B_C_PTY).

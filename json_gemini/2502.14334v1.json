Furthermore, in our problem model, while allocating sampling times to different quantum systems, we also need to select the basis for quantum measurement, which significantly increases the complexity of this problem. In this paper, we focus on the issue of the purest quantum state identification, i.e., identifying the purest quantum state from a set of available quantum states after measurements. Given the limited qubits in the NISQ era, current quantum devices may not be capable of supporting quantum computation at a large scale. In many quantum applications, the simultaneous replication of quantum states is infeasible [Yu21], and storing information about these states also requires exponential costs [HEH+16]. Therefore, utilizing coherent (multi-copy) measurement may not be feasible when measuring quantum states.\nWe formalize the PQSI with incoherent measurement as follows:\nProblem 1.1 (Purest quantum state identification (PQSI) with incoherent measurement). Consider a set of K unknown quantum states, denoted as $S = \\{\\rho_1,\\ldots,\\rho_K\\}$. In each round $t \\in \\{1,...,N\\}$, the learner chooses a quantum state $\\sigma_t$ from the set S and get a copy of it. Then the learner can choose a POVM $M_t$ and uses it to measure $\\sigma_t$. Upon completing N measurements, the learner selects a quantum state $\\rho' \\in S$ based on the measurement outcomes. The objective of the learner is to maximize $P(\\rho' \\in arg \\max_{\\rho \\in S} Tr(\\rho^2))$.\nIn general, when coherent measurements are available, we formalize the problem of PQSI as follows:\nProblem 1.2 (The purest quantum state identification(PQSI)).

In each round $t \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$, the learner chooses a quantum state $\\sigma_t$ from the set S and get a copy of it. Then, the learner can choose a subset $S_t$ (which may be an empty set) from quantum state copies he holds. Next, the learner can choose an entangled POVM $M_t$ and uses it to measure the quantum state copies in $S_t$, and these state copies are destroyed. After completing all the measurements, the learner selects a quantum state $\\rho'$ based on the measurement outcomes. The objective of the learner is to maximize $P (\\rho' \\in arg \\max_{\\rho \\in S} Tr(\\rho^2))$."}, {"title": "Algorithms.", "content": "We developed two distinct algorithms to address this problem in different settings.

When the coherent measurements are unavailable, we developed the algorithm SR-PQSI with incoherent measurement. We use the purity estimator to estimate the purity of quantum states and the successive reject method to allocate sampling times.

When distinguishing quantum states from two alternative sets, previous work usually assumes that one of them is the maximally mixed state or pure state to reduce the difficulty of analysis. In our problem, the learner must frequently distinguish between quantum states with different purity, making this analysis method unsuitable.\nFor incoherent measurements, we reduce the problem based on the properties of quantum states and quantum measurements.

There are extensive investigations conducted to understand the complexities of various measurements.\nQuantum state tomography [BCG13, GLF+10, CHL+23, CCHL22] involves obtaining complete information about the density matrix of a quantum state through measurements. While this technique can be employed to tackle the PQSI problem, it incurs significant sampling costs. For the quantum state certification [BCL20, CLHL22, Wri16, CLO22], the target is to determine whether a quantum state is close to a specific target quantum state. Our problem can be viewed as identifying the quantum state that is the farthest from the maximally mixed state. However, this problem is focused on quantum testing and does not deal with distance estimation. Therefore, these methods cannot be applied to the PQSI problem. Another category of problems relates to inner product estimation between two quantum states [ALL22, HIJ+24, ZCN+22, HKP20]. When proving lower bounds, this category often significantly restricts the quantum states for distinction.\nThe relevant literature employs two general approaches to establish problem complexity. The first approach involves constructing counterexamples using Haar unitary matrices [ALL22, CCHL22, CLO22, BCL20]. However, the representation-theoretic structure of Haar unitary matrices is intricate [Mel24], which makes it difficult to use. The other approach uses Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) matrices to create counterexamples [CLHL22, CHL+23].

Among the classical learning tasks, the best arm identification [AB10, GK16, Rus16, JN14, GGL12] has been extensively studied, and is divided into two categories: fixed budget [Bec68] and fixed confidence [Pau64]. However, the existing research can only deal with the problem under specific distributions. These limitations restrict the algorithm's applicability and leave considerable room for further research on this issue. In our problem, we must select an appropriate POVM basis while choosing the quantum state in each round. The quantum state space and the POVM space grows exponentially with the increase in qubits, which makes this problem significantly more challenging than solving a classical problem of the best arm identification."}, {"title": "3 Preliminaries and Notations", "content": "In this work, we will use Dirac's bra-ket notation, where $|\\psi\\rangle \\in C^d$ denotes a column vector and $\\langle\\psi| = |\\psi\\rangle^{\\dagger}$.

Then $\\{\\vert i \\rangle\\langle i \\vert\\}_{i=0}^{d-1}$ is a fixed orthogonal basis in $C^{d\\times d}$.\nQuantum State. Let $d = 2^n$ denote the dimension of a n-qubit quantum system. An n-qubit quantum state can be represented by a density matrix $\\rho \\in C^{d\\times d}$, which is Hermitian and trace-1 positive semi-definite. In particular, an n-qubit pure quantum state can be represented by a unit vector $|\\psi\\rangle \\in C^d$. The purity of a quantum state $\\rho$ is $Tr(\\rho^2)$.\nQuantum Measurement. Quantum measurements are usually described by a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM), which produces probabilistic outcomes. The formal definition of a POVM is as follows:\nDefinition 3.1 (Positive Operator-valued measurement (POVM), see e.g. [NC10]). An n-qubit positive operator-valued measurement M can be represented as a collection of positive semi-definite matrices $M = \\{M_m\\}_m$, where $M_m \\in C^{d\\times d}$ and $\\sum_m M_m = I_d$. When using M to measure a quantum state $\\rho$, the probability of outcome m is $Tr(M_m\\rho)$, and the quantum state $\\rho$ is destroyed.\nWhen the coherent measurement method is employed, the learner can perform entanglement measurements on quantum states $\\rho_1 \\otimes ...\\otimes \\rho_m$. However, this approach necessitates the support of large-scale quantum devices and quantum memory, which are not feasible with current quantum technologies. Therefore, researching incoherent measurement methods applicable to NISQ-era quantum devices is of great significance.\nIn this study, we aim to identify the purest quantum state from a set of unknown quantum states, achieving the highest probability through N measurements. For the purpose of simplicity, we will assume that there exists a unique optimal quantum state that is the purest in the set S, denoted as $\\rho^* = \\rho_{i^*}$. For $i \\neq i^*$, we represent the purity difference between each non-optimal quantum state and the optimal quantum state using the following expression:\n$\\Delta_i = Tr (\\rho_{(1)}^2) - Tr (\\rho_{(i)}^2)$.\nFor $i \\in \\{1, ..., K\\}$, let $\\rho_{(i)}$ be the i-th purest quantum state in S, then we have\n$Tr (\\rho_{(1)}^2) = Tr (\\rho_{(1)}^2) > Tr (\\rho_{(2)}^2) \\geq ... \\geq Tr (\\rho_{(K)}^2)$,"}, {"title": "4 Algorithm for PQSI with incoherent measurement", "content": "The current era of quantum computing, known as the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) period, presents limitations in the number of available qubits.

For a distribution p supported on $\\{0, ..., d - 1\\}$, let $p_i$ denote the probability of observing i in the distribution p. We employ the following purity estimation method to estimate the $\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} p_i^2$.\nDefinition 4.1 (purity estimator).

We use the purity estimator defined in Definition 4.1 to perform this estimation. Additionally, we utilize the successive reject algorithm to distribute a limited number of sampling times across the available quantum states, thereby enhancing the algorithm's accuracy. The algorithm we designed to solve the PQSI problem is shown in Algorithm 1.\nBy using the techniques similar to [ALL22], we can prove the following lemma:\nLemma 4.2 (See Lemma 16 of [ALL22]).

Consequently, the complexity analysis of testing problems often assumes that one of the quantum states is either a pure state or a maximally mixed state.

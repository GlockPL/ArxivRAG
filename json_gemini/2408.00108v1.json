Specifically, we introduce Preference-Based Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (which we call AA-CBR-P), allowing users to define multiple approaches to compare cases with an ordering that specifies their preference over these comparison approaches. We prove that the model inherently follows these preferences when making predictions and show that previous abstract argumentation for case-based reasoning approaches are insufficient at expressing preferences over constituents of an argument. We then demonstrate how this can be applied to a real-world medical dataset sourced from a clinical trial evaluating differing assessment methods of patients with a primary brain tumour. We show empirically that our approach outperforms other interpretable machine learning models on this dataset.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Abstract argumentation is a formalism for representing arguments and relationships between them, and for computing which arguments to accept (Dung 1995). It has been shown to be effective for recommendation systems (Rago et al. 2020), decision-making tasks (Amgoud and Prade 2009), reasoning with incomplete knowledge (Briguez et al. 2014) and approaches to explainable artificial intelligence (\u010cyras et al. 2021b).\nCase-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving methodology where new problems are solved by retrieving and adapting solutions from similar past cases. Approaches to combine CBR with abstract argumentation are successful for explaining the output of machine learning (Prakken and Ratsma 2022) or for making predictions (Cocarascu et al. 2020). Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR) (\u010cyras, Satoh, and Toni 2016) is a data-driven interpretable classification and explanation model which has been shown to have utility in many tasks, for example, as an interpretable binary classifier (Cocarascu, \u010cyras, and Toni 2018; Cocarascu et al. 2020; Paulino-Passos and Toni 2023), for cautiously monotonic reasoning (Paulino-Passos and Toni 2021a) or for explaining known legislative outcomes (\u010cyras et al. 2019).\nAs a result, AA-CBR represents a novel paradigm as an intrinsically explainable classification model. The need for such models in high-stakes decision-making is becoming increasingly apparent. In medical domains, for instance, decision-support tools need to be understood by a clinician for trust to be established and disagreements to be resolved (Amann et al. 2020). Moreover, legal requirements, such as those established by GDPR (Goodman and Flaxman 2017), require explainable AI to varying extents.\nHowever, previous approaches to AA-CBR are missing the ability to compare cases by user-defined preferences. Preferences allow stakeholders to influence a decision-making tool and inject domain-specific knowledge, resulting in more desirable reasoning systems or better-performing models. Preferences have been integrated with argumentation systems through a variety of approaches, for example, preferences defined over abstract arguments in preference-based argumentation frameworks (Amgoud and Cayrol 1998); preferences defined over structured arguments in ASPIC+ (Modgil and Prakken 2013); preferences defined over values assigned to arguments as in value-based argumentation frameworks (Bench-Capon 2003); preferences defined by defeats of attack relations as with extended argumentation frameworks (Modgil 2009); preferences defined over constituents of an argument such as with Assumption-Based Argumentation with Preferences (ABA+) (Cyras and Toni 2016); and preferences over constituents of cases in which arguments are derived such as with case models\u00b9 (Zheng, Grossi, and Verheij 2020).\nWithin healthcare, preferences allow for specialist expertise and patient goals to affect the decision-making process, leading to more agreeable courses of action (Politi et al. 2013). Moreover, preferences with argumentation have many applications within the medical domain (\u010cyras et al. 2021a; Kakas, Moraitis, and Spanoudakis 2018; Hunter and Williams 2012; Williams et al. 2015).\nDespite this, there is yet to be an AA-CBR-based approach that can integrate preferences over the constituents of arguments. Considering the benefits of AA-CBR as an interpretable classification model, adding preferences will\n\u00b9Literature on AA-CBR, including this work, uses the terms 'arguments' and 'cases' interchangeably, however, in work on case models, these concepts are separate."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "2.1 Abstract Argumentation\nAn abstract argumentation framework (AF) (Dung 1995) is a pair (Args,\u2192) where Args is a set of arguments and \u2192 C Args \u00d7 Args is a binary relation between arguments. For arguments, \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Args, \u03b1 attacks \u03b2 if \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2. An AF can be represented as a directed graph where nodes are arguments and edges represent attacks. A set of arguments E C Args defends an argument \u03b2 \u2208 Args if for all \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 there exists \u03b3\u2208 E such that \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1. For determining which arguments to accept, we focus on the grounded extension (Dung 1995), which can be iteratively computed as G = Ui\u22650 Gi, where Go is the set of unattacked arguments and Vi \u2265 0, Gi+1 is the set of all arguments that Gi defends.\n2.2 Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based\nReasoning (AA-CBR)\nAA-CBR is a binary classification model utilising argumentation as the reasoner. It operates on a casebase D comprised of labelled examples of a generic characterisation. Given D and a new unlabelled example, N, AA-CBR assigns a label to the new case. Formally:\nDefinition 1 (Adapted from (Paulino-Passos and Toni 2021a; Cocarascu et al. 2020)). Let D C X \u00d7 Y be a finite casebase of labelled examples where X is a set of characterisations and Y = {\u03b4, \u00ac\u03b4} is the set of possible outcomes. Each example is of the form (x, y). Let (x\u03b4, \u03b4) be the default argument with \u03b4 the default outcome. Let N be an unlabelled example of the form (xN, Y?) with y? an unknown outcome. The function AA-CBR(D, xN) assigns the new case an outcome as follows:\nAA-CBR(D, xN) = {\u03b4 if (x\u03b4, \u03b4) \u2208 G,\n\u00ac\u03b4 otherwise.\nwhere G is the grounded extension of the argumentation framework derived from D and xN, known as AF(D,xN).\nAF(D,xN) is constructed with cases of differing outcomes modelled as arguments. It is assumed that characterisations of the data points are equipped with a partial order, which determines the direction of attacks within the casebase and is used to ensure attacks occur between cases with minimal difference. The new case (xN,Y?) is added to the AF by attacking cases considered irrelevant to it, as defined by a provided irrelevance relation x.\nDefinition 2 (Adapted from (Paulino-Passos and Toni 2021a; Cocarascu et al. 2020)). Let \u2265 and be a partial order and binary relation defined over X, respectively. The argumentation framework AF(D,xN) mined from D and xN is (Args, \u2192) in which:\n\u2022 Args = DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)} \u222a {N}\n\u2022 for (x\u03b1, y\u03b1), (x\u03b2,y\u03b2) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4,\u03b4)}, it holds that (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) \u2192 (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) iff\n1. y\u03b1 \u2260 y\u03b2, and\n2. either x\u03b1 > x\u03b2 and \u2204(x\u03b3,y\u03b3) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)} with x\u03b1 > x\u03b3 > x\u03b2\n3. or x\u03b1 = x\u03b2;\n\u2022 for (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)}, it holds that N \u2192 (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) iff N x (x\u03b1, y\u03b1).\nA casebase D is coherent iff there are no two cases (x\u03b1,y\u03b1), (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) \u2208 D such that x\u03b1 = x\u03b2 and y\u03b1 \u2260 y\u03b2, and it is incoherent otherwise.\nThe second bullet of Definition 2 defines attacks between the cases in the casebase. Condition 2 ensures that attacks occur from greater cases to smaller ones according to the provided partial order. When multiple possible attacks occur, we enforce that attacks originate from the case with minimal difference compared to the attacked case. We refer to this as the most concise possible attack. Condition 3 defines symmetric attacks for an incoherent casebase.\n2.3 AA-CBR with Stages\nAn extension to AA-CBR (\u010cyras et al. 2019) employs stages in the characterisations to represent dynamic features. Stages represent the time at which a case was recorded. If two cases have the same set of features, then the time measure is used to distinguish the cases. If the only difference between two cases is the time measure and the outcome, then it is possible that the change in outcome by the latter case is a result of features that have not been recorded. This approach recognises that not all data may be available and so uses a time measure as a proxy to reason about unknown data. This version of AA-CBR is not defined generally for any characterisation but instead only for a set of features and stages."}, {"title": "3 Motivations", "content": "The partial order used to define attacks in the casebase is a key choice affecting the performance and explanations generated by an AA-CBR model. Selecting a different partial order at model construction may result in varying model performance even when using the same dataset. Additionally, different partial orders have different semantic meanings, so the explanations will differ when describing how an\nAA-CBR model made its final prediction. However, using a single partial order limits users' ability to express domain-specific preferences over how cases are compared.\nExample 1. Consider a simple medical assessment tool for assessing patients' well-being. The tool represents patient features using sets and classifies patients as either being in 'good' health (+) or 'poor' health (-).\nA past patient (C1) who gets regular exercise (feature a) and has a healthy diet (feature b) is in good health is represented by the case ({a,b}, +). Similarly, a patient (C2) who has adequate sleep (feature c) is represented by the case ({c}, +). In contrast, a patient (C3) who currently has an infection (feature d) and is considered in poor health is rep-"}, {"title": "4 Preference-Based Abstract Argumentation\nfor Case-Based Reasoning", "content": "We introduce AA-CBR-P and its regular variant AA-CBR-P, where a user can employ various preorders\u2074 defined over constituent parts of an argument. The preorders are sorted by preferences and applied using a lexicographic strategy. We begin by defining the collection of preorders.\nDefinition 4 (Preference Ordering). Let P = (\u22651,\u2026\u2026\u2026, \u2265n) be a sequence of preorders, each defined over X. Each preorder, \u2265i, is a reflexive and transitive relation, with a corresponding strict preorder, >i (which is irreflexive and transitive), and an equivalence relation, =i (which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive). For cases (x\u03b1, y\u03b1), (x\u03b2,y\u03b2) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)}, we define:\n\u2022 x\u03b1 >i x\u03b2 iff x\u03b1 \u2265i x\u03b2 and x\u03b2 \u2271i x\u03b1\n\u2022 x\u03b1 =i x\u03b2 iff x\u03b1 \u2265i x\u03b2 and x\u03b2 \u2265i x\u03b1\nIn simple terms, the ordering of P determines the preferences of the preorders. If two cases are equivalent by the first preorder, then a comparison under the second order can be used. If they are also equivalent by the second order, the third can be used. This process continues, using subsequent preorders when equivalence occurs. By incorporating multiple methods for comparing cases, we afford flexibility to select the approach that optimises performance and injects domain relevance. Consequently, we can create a new AA-CBR-based model that utilises P. To do so, we make use of the following shorthand:\nNotation 1. We use x\u03b1 \u2265[j:k] x\u03b2, where j \u2264 k, to mean x\u03b1 is equivalent or larger than x\u03b2 on all preorders between orders \u2265j and \u2265k (inclusive). Formally:\nx\u03b1 \u2265[j:k] x\u03b2 iff \u2200i \u2208 [j, k], x\u03b1 \u2265i x\u03b2.\nShorthands for =[j:k] and >[j:k] are defined analogously.\nWith this, we can create a definition similar to Definition 2 that enforces attacks in the direction defined by the sequence of partial orders and that attacks only originate from the most concise case possible, thus representing minimal change between cases. With the addition of multiple preorders, the concision condition must now consider the lexicographic application of the orders. We first define a notion of potential attacks for a particular order i, which describes attacks that would transpire if we do not consider concision.\nPrevious incarnations of AA-CBR use a partial order; as we use multiple orders to compare cases, each can be a preorder. For example, we have ({c,d}, {a}) \u2265H ({c,d}, {b}) and ({c,d}, {b}) \u2265H ({c,d}, {a}) but these two characterisations are not equivalent.\nDefinition 5 (Potential Attacks). Let \u03b1 = (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) and \u03b2 = (x\u03b2,y\u03b2). For \u03b1,\u03b2\u2208 DU {(x\u03b4,\u03b4)}, we define a potential attack on order \u2265i as: \u03b1 i \u03b2 iff\ni. y\u03b1 \u2260 y\u03b2, and\nii. x\u03b1 >i x\u03b2, and\niii. x\u03b1 =[1:i-1] x\u03b2.\nIntuitively, \u03b1 potentially attacks \u03b2 on order \u2265i when the outcomes of the cases are different (i), x\u03b1 is strictly greater than x\u03b2 by order >i (ii) and they are equivalent on all orders before i (iii). Conditions (ii) and (iii) apply P lexicographically. We can subsequently restrict attacks to the most concise attacks.\nDefinition 6 (Casebase Attacks). Let \u03b1 = (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) and \u03b2 = (x\u03b2, y\u03b2). For \u03b1,\u03b2\u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)}, we define an attack on order i: \u03b1i \u03b2 iff\ni. \u03b1i \u03b2 and\nii. \u2204\u03b3 = (x\u03b3,y\u03b3) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, d)} with x\u03b1 \u2265[1:n] x\u03b3 and\n(a) either \u03b3 <i \u03b2 and \u2203l > i, x\u03b1 >l x\u03b3,\n(b) or \u03b3 i \u03b2 and \u2203l > i, \u03b3 >l \u03b2.\nThis definition states that case \u03b1 attacks case \u03b2 on order \u2265i if two conditions are met. Firstly, \u03b1 potentially attacks \u03b2 on order \u2265i (i), and secondly, \u03b1 is the most concise case capable of such an attack (ii). We illustrate the two conditions of concision in Figure 3, utilising the same characterisation approach as Example 2 and letting P = (\u2265H, \u2265L).\n(a) Condition a details the circumstance where both \u03b1 and \u03b3 can potentially attack \u03b2 on order \u2265i and x\u03b3 is smaller than x\u03b1 on at least one of the orders in P. As both \u03b1 and \u03b3 are potential attackers of \u03b2, we know that they are both equivalent to \u03b2 on all orders up to and including i-1, that is x\u03b1 =[1:i-1] x\u03b3 =[1:i-1] x\u03b2. Furthermore, as x\u03b1 [1:n] x\u03b3, we know there is an l' such that l > l' > i in which x\u03b1 =[i-1:l'-1] x\u03b3 and x\u03b1 >l' x\u03b3. This is to say, both x\u03b1 and x\u03b3 are equivalent on all orders up to some order \u2265i in which x\u03b1 is greater than x\u03b3. As a result, we can take \u03b3 as the more concise case. In Figure 3a, \u03b1 potentially attacks \u03b2 by \u2265H but is blocked by the more concise case \u03b3 because they are equivalent on the first preorder, \u2265H, i.e. both have features {c,d}, but \u03b3 is less specific on the second preorder as {a,b} > {a}.\n(b) Condition b covers the instance where \u03b1 is greater than \u03b3 on \u2265i but \u03b3 cannot potentially attack \u03b2 on order i as \u03b3 and \u03b2 are equivalent on all orders up to and including \u2265i. \u03b3 is, therefore, only a more concise case if it can potentially attack by some order \u2265l where l > i. This is because, by x\u03b1 [1:n] x\u03b3, we have that \u03b1 is greater than \u03b3 on all orders up to an including order \u2265l that is x\u03b1 \u2265l x\u03b3. Therefore, we know that x\u03b1 \u2265l x\u03b3 >i x\u03b2 and thus can take \u03b3 as a more concise case. In Figure 3b \u03b1 potentially attacks \u03b2 by \u2265H but is blocked by \u03b3 which has an equivalent high-priority feature set as \u03b2 (both of which are {\u00d8}) and \u03b3 has a superset of \u03b2's low-priority features so \u03b3 attacks by order \u2265L.\nDefinition 7 (Coherent and Incoherent Casebases). A casebase D is coherent iff there are no two cases (x\u03b1,y\u03b1), (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) \u2208 D such that x\u03b1 =[1:n] x\u03b2 and y\u03b1 \u2260 y\u03b2, and it is incoherent otherwise.\nIncoherence is handled with symmetric attacks:\nDefinition 8 (Incoherent Attacks). For (x\u03b1, y\u03b1), (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4,d)}, we define an incoherent attack: (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) \u2194 (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) iff x\u03b1 =[1:n] x\u03b2 and y\u03b1 \u2260 y\u03b2.\nWe have now defined all possible attacks between arguments in the casebase. We add the new case to the AF analogous to Definition 2, utilising a notion of irrelevance.\nDefinition 9 (New Case Attacks). For (x\u03b1,y\u03b1) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4, \u03b4)} and new case N = (xN, Y?), we define a new case attack: N \u2194 (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) iff N x (x\u03b1, y\u03b1).\nWith these attacks defined, we can now define the argumentation framework for AA-CBR-P.\nDefinition 10 (Argumentation Framework drawn from P). The argumentation framework AFp(D,xN) mined from dataset D and a new case N, with a sequence of preorders P of length n is (Args, \u2194) where\nArgs = DU {(x\u03b4,\u03b4)} \u222a {N} and \u2192= (Ui=1\u2194i) \u222a\u2248\nAs with Definition 1, the outcome predicted for N, written as AA-CBR-P(D, xN), is \u03b4 if (x\u03b4, \u03b4) is in the grounded extension G of the AF and \u00ac\u03b4 otherwise.\nWe also define a regular variant of AA-CBR-P that enforces that irrelevance is written in terms of the partial orders in P and that x\u03b4 is the least element by all orders in P. The regular variant naturally aligns with expectations that irrelevance is directly related to the partial order defining attacks. Moreover, regular AA-CBR-P has desired properties that we discuss in Section 5.\nDefinition 11 (Regular). The AF mined from D and N, with default argument (x\u03b4, \u03b4) is regular when:\n1. The irrelevance relation \u2248 is defined as x\u03b1 \u2248 xN iff \u2203i, x\u03b1 \u226fi xN.\n2. x\u03b4 is the least element on all orders in P.\nDefinition 11 is a generalisation of the approach in (Paulino-Passos and Toni 2021a). We will use the notation AA-CBR-P to refer to the regular variant of AA-CBR-P with an arbitrary instantiation of P. We will populate the subscript with a sequence of preorders to refer to an instantiation of the model. Similarly, we will use AFp\u203a(D,xN) to refer to the regular variant of AFP(D, xN). To illustrate, consider the following:\nExample 4. Based on Example 2, we can utilise AA-CBR-P to create a model that obeys preferences in all circumstances. We let P = \u3008\u2265H, \u2265L) and refer to this model as AA-CBR-P\u2265H,\u2265L. AFP(\u2265H,\u2265L)(D,xN1) is shown in Figure 4a and AFP(\u2265H,\u2265L) (D, xN2) in Figure 4b. In both instances, the preferences are respected, and we see that the classification for N1 and N2 are determined by the most important features, d and c, respectively. C1 is no longer considered a more concise case than C2, thus, they can now both attack Co. The grounded extension for AFP(\u2265H,\u2265L)(D,xN1) is {N1,C3,C0} with the predicted outcome, -, as desired. For AFP(\u2265H,\u2265L)(D, xN2) the grounded extension is {N2, C2} with the predicted outcome, +, again as desired.\nExample 4 illustrates how, in general, AA-CBR by Definition 2 cannot capture AA-CBR-P. C2 and C3 are cases that should be treated with similar importance within the casebase; both have a single high-priority feature but differing outcomes. With a single partial order, as in AA-CBR, we can only support one of two possible scenarios:\n1. either C2 and C3 are considered incomparable to C1, allowing both C2 and C1 to attack Co but C3 cannot attack C1 as in Figure la,\n2. or C2 and C3 are considered larger than C1 by the partial order, allowing C3 to attack C1 but then C1 is a more concise case than C2, meaning only C1 can attack Co, as in Figure 1b and 1c.\nAA-CBR-P allows for C2 and C3 to be treated with similar importance within the casebase, but have C3 still attack\n\u2074We will provide a formal definition of nearest cases in our setting in Section 5."}, {"title": "5 Nearest and Preferred Cases", "content": "With a coherent casebase, D, and a regular AF, we can identify cases which, when in agreement on an outcome, precisely determine the outcome predicted by AA-CBR-P. In this section, we will present this formally\u2075. Note that when D is coherent, the argumentation framework is guaranteed to be acyclic.\nProposition 1. The argumentation framework corresponding to AA-CBR-Pis guaranteed to be acyclic for a coherent D.\nPrevious approaches to AA-CBR have shown that for a coherent casebase if all cases that are nearest to the new case N have the same outcome, then that outcome\nDefinition 12 (Nearest Case). A case (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) \u2208 DU {(x\u03b4,d)} is nearest to N iff xN \u2265[1:n] x\u03b1 and (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) is maximally so, that is, there is no (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) \u2208 D such that xN \u2265[1:n] x\u03b2 and x\u03b2 \u2265[1:n] x\u03b1 and \u2203i, x\u03b2 >i x\u03b1.\nIntuitively, this states a case (x\u03b1,y\u03b1) that is smaller to N on all orders in P is nearest when there does not exist another case, (x\u03b2, y\u03b2), that is similarly smaller to N on all orders, no smaller than (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) on any orders and greater than (x\u03b1, y\u03b1) on at least one order. If (x\u03b2, y\u03b2) exists, it is a better candidate for being the nearest case than (x\u03b1, y\u03b1). We can define the relationship between nearest and new cases as follows:\nTheorem 2. If D is coherent and every nearest case to N is of the form (x, y) for some outcome y \u2208 Y, then AA-CBR-P\u2039\u203a(D, xN) = y.\nThe constraint x\u03b1\u2265[1:n] x\u03b3 in (ii) in Definition 6 ensures that Theorem 2 holds. It enforces that a case is only more concise than another if it is smaller by all orders in P. Without this constraint, an irrelevant case may prevent a nearest case from contributing to the classification by the concision. This explains the violation of the nearest cases theorem with AA-CBR with Stages in Example 3. AA-CBR-P resolves this.\nExample 5. To illustrate, we instantiate AA-CBR-P with P = \u2265\u2283, and case characterisations corresponding to that of Definition 3. For x\u03b1 = (f\u03b1, s\u03b1) and x\u03b2 = (f\u03b2, s\u03b2):\n\u2022 x\u03b1 \u2265\u2286 x\u03b2 iff f\u03b1 \u2287 f\u03b2,\n\u2022 x\u03b1 \u2265\u2283 x\u03b2 iff s\u03b1 \u2283 s\u03b2.\nWe will refer to this model as AA-CBR-P\u2283,\u2283.\nThe argumentation framework, AFP\u2265\u2283,\u2283\u2039 (D,xN) corresponding to the cases from Example 3 is shown in Figure 5.

The objective is to predict if the patient has progressive disease or not, as labelled by the outcome of the next MRI scan following the questionnaire or the patient's mortality status. Furthermore, we can incorporate the number of previous instances of progressive disease for each patient, serving as a proxy for cancer progression. We conduct two experiments to evaluate the models. The first experiment solely utilises PA and PRO data, while the second incorporates both PA and PRO data along with the proxy measurement as stages. Each experiment consists of multiple AA-CBR(-P) models compared against similarly interpretable baseline models: a decision tree and a K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN).\nIn the first experiment, we compare AA-CBR with the relation as defined in Example 1 (we denote this\nDetails on data can be found in Appendix D."}, {"title": "7 Related Work and Discussion", "content": "Preferences over arguments have been shown to resolve situations in which the direction of an attack is unclear."}]}

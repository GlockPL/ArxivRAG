Introduction", "content": "We understand 'cyber information' to refer to information carried by electronic devices, anything from copper wire to display monitors to hard drives. The purpose of this paper is to describe a set of general terms and semantics for representing cyber information in ontologies that extend from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Relations Ontology (RO), and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) [1][2][3].\nTwo caveats regarding the scope of this paper. First, the terms introduced here are too general and too few to comprise an ontology of their own; their home is presently unclear. However, whether they join CCO, one of its extensions, or land elsewhere these terms are a step towards allowing CCO to interface with ontologies dealing with cyber information and its management. Hence, we refer to these terms collectively as Towards a Cyber Information Ontology (TACIO). Second, there is nothing fundamentally different about cyber information compared to pen-and-paper information. The difference, rather, is found in the management of cyber information. The backbone of cyber information management is rapid copying of information, which is found at all levels of cyberinformation management (e.g., [4] [5]). Compare: you write a letter and mail that letter to a recipient; you write an email, and that email is copied, that copy is copied, and so on until a copy arrives on the intended recipient's machine. Hence, the focus in TACIO on terms for the copying, duplicating, and pseudo copying of information.\nWhy build an interface for cyber ontologies to extend from CCO? As an extension of the BFO/CCO suite, a cyber information ontology gains interoperability with ontologies spanning medicine, biology, manufacturing, defense, and intelligence. Such interoperability is of high value given the importance and ubiquity of cyber information. We leave it to electrical engineers, physicists, and other relevant subject matter experts to make use of this interface by building more specific ontologies, like an ontology of"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "Transmission of information across cyber information systems will be better understood, modeled with higher precision, and engender greater trust among users, if the rather opaque nature of the domain were adequately represented in widely used ontologies such as BFO and CCO. While at least one ontology exists that is designed to represent the domain of data fusion [6], none do so by extending from a modular suite of upper- and mid-level ontologies. Ontologies that do not conform to standardized architecture are limited in their interoperability, scalability, and ability to aid information extrapolation from diverse data sets. Crucially, as more ontologies are developed that use the same upper-levels, and themselves reused in other applications, there occurs a community- driven stepwise improvement of the reused ontologies. Importantly, ontologies that facilitate interoperability among all-source data may provide valuable machine-learning assessments of iterative data fusion pipelines, whereby slices of a pipeline are evaluated to discover how best to compose optimal pipelines, as evidenced in intelligence analysis approaches [7]. It is challenging to see how such assessment might be conducted without interoperability.\nA concrete example of the need for TACIO is the current state of The Common Core Cyber Ontology (C3O) [8]. C3O is designed to represent entities relevant to the cyber domain [9]. It contains a mix of high-level terms, such as Computer Program, Computer Network, Computer Language, Digital File, as well a mix of more specific terms, e.g., Packet Header, Ethernet Cord, and Botnet. While some C3O terms are relevant to information processing and transfer, like Data Synchronization Utility and File Compressor, none explicitly characterize information tracing and authenticity validation through transformations, encodings, and manipulations of data over their digital lifespan. There is, moreover, no unifying set of terms and semantics available to C3O for representing different kinds of encoding in the cyber domain. Thus, while C3O is in general expressively rich, coverage could be improved. We intend TACIO to supplement C3O, provide motivation for refining C3O terms, and support C3O extensions, especially fusion-related applications.\nOur work is guided by the CCO approach to modeling information. CCO's approach to information distinguishes the content of information both from the artifacts which carry it and from the patterns exhibited by those artifacts. The screen of a computer monitor, for example, is an artifact that bears patterns - patterns of shapes and colors - that concretize information content. These distinctions allow the flexible relationship between artifacts, patterns, and information content to be represented. Consider, your monitor screen could bear any of the following distinct patterns: '\u03c0', 'pi', '3.14...', or \u20183.14159265358979323...', and all of these would concretize (and convey) the same information content, assuming certain conventions in the language of contemporary mathematics. Similarly, an iPad screen might exhibit smaller patterns which also carry (and convey) the same information. Likewise, an assistive device could concretize (and convey) the same information content, using acoustic patterns to convey what is also carried by the patterns on screen."}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "3.1. Imports\nOur starting point was the top-level ontology BFO and the mid-level CCO suite. BFO was imported in full, but not all modules in the CCO suite were needed. Additionally, an extension of CCO, the Cognitive Process Ontology (CPO), was imported [10]. CPO was built from prior ontological work [11] [12] and provides terms useful for modeling mental processing [9]. The latter has been used to model intelligence analyst workflows and processes of forming and asserting trustworthy medical diagnoses [8] [13]. Characterization of trustworthy transmission of information among analysts and physicians is a special case of trustworthy transmission of information generally. As the latter is within the scope of cyber information, and more specifically of data fusion, domains, importing CPO is warranted for our project. On the other hand, the C3O was not imported."}, {"title": "3.2.

Results", "content": "The preceding competency questions were used to guide the use of terms from imported ontologies during our first experiment. After observing gaps in the expressivity of our terminology, we introduced additional terminological content needed to adequately answer the competency questions. The competency questions were then used to validate our results in a second experiment.\nThe top-level terminological content found in Table 1 was observed to be sufficient to model, at a high level, information content, the carriers of that content, and the features that encode that content, and in this regard, was found suitable to act as an interface between the BFO/CCO suite and a cyber ontology. However, these terms, though necessary, were not sufficient to model the managing and transmission of cyber information."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "5.1. Acts of Encoding\nCyber information systems spread ICEs by creating copies of IBEs which carry the same content. For example, emailing involves using a sender's IBE as reference in a copying process which produces a distinct IBE on the recipient's machine. If successful, each IBE carries the same ICE.\nTo capture these phenomena, we first introduce the term Act of Encoding: An Intentional Act whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity to carry some intended Information Content Entity. As an intentional act, any instance of Act of Encoding involves an agent intentionally arranging, manipulating, or creating some material entity for the purpose of carrying specific information content. This class is broad enough to include writing in a notebook, using fireworks to display a message, as well as an agent using a computer to manipulate magnetic fields to store information. This term thus accommodates ways in which cyber information systems manipulate IBEs to store, protect, or transmit ICEs.\nWe moreover introduce a subclass of Act of Encoding, Act of Copying: An Act of Encoding whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity with the intention that this Material Entity carry the same ICE as some Reference Carrier. Consequently, we also introduce Reference Carrier: A material entity that is the input to an Act of Copying and that carries the ICE intended to be carried by the output of that Act of Copying. Thus, if the ICE carried by the output Material Entity is the same ICE carried by the Reference Carrier, then the Act of Copying is successful. For example, if I copy a quote from a book by hand, then part of the book is the Reference Carrier, and, if what I copy by hand carries the same ICE as the relevant part of the book, then the Act of Copying was successful. Similarly, if an ICE carried by a portion of my laptop is sent to some recipient, then this Act of Copying is successful if the process outputs a Material Entity (in this case, part of the recipient's laptop), which carries the same ICE as was carried by the relevant portion of my laptop. (Note, to be clear, a failed, or unsuccessful, act of copying is one where the output IBE carries an ICE different from the Reference Carrier. There is no such thing as an Act of Copying where there is no output.)\nOf course, Acts of Copying may spread information across different carrier types, like copying notes from paper to chalk board, inputting handwritten manuscripts into a word processor, or an operating systems' copying content from persistent storage to RAM. To represent such processes, we introduce Act of Information Carrier Transition: An Act of Copying whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity that is of a type different from the Reference Carrier, but which bears the same type of concretizing SDCs.\nCopying may also spread information across distinct types of concretizing SDCs. Some potential examples include changing the font type of a text, translating a text into an equally expressive language, and performing certain algebraic operations in mathematics. This motivates the introduction of Act of Concretizer Transition: An Act of Copying whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity that bears concretizing SDCs of types distinct from those inhering in the Reference Carrier, but where that Material Entity is of the same type.\nThere are also many cases where the carrier and the concretizers both transition. For example, consider a voice-to-text application that transitions information concretized by patterns of acoustic waves to, say, a binary pattern of electromagnetic features inhering in a machine. Hence, we introduce Act of Carrier and Concretizer Transition: An Act of Copying that is both an Act of Information Carrier Transition and an Act of Concretizer Transition. Notably, this is a defined class, characterized entirely in terms of other TACIO classes.\nSome Acts of Copying spread information by duplication, where a Material Entity is produced that is exactly similar (or something relevantly close to this) as the reference carrier; in the parlance previously used, there is no transition at all. For example, a file"}, {"content": "system that creates snapshots of files, for the sake of redundancy, is likely creating duplicates in our intended sense. Thus, we introduce the class Act of Information Duplication: An Act of Copying whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity that is of the same type and bears the same type of concretizing SDCs as the Reference Carrier.\nLastly, some acts of encoding produce a specification for what an act of copying should output. Thus, though the relevant ICE is not carried by the instructions, it is reproducible, such as the processes through which data packets are fragmented then reassembled during network transmission, according to Internet Protocol. We introduce two classes to address such scenarios. Information Carrier Structure Entity: A Directive Information Content Entity that prescribes the formation of a Material Entity that is a copy of a Reference Carrier; and Act of Encoding an Information Carrier Structure Entity: An Act of Encoding whereby an Agent forms an Information Carrier Structure Entity. Each of these entities is important in modeling acts of copying in a fine-grained manner in the cyber domain.\n5.2. Aggregates of Information Carriers\nActs of Copying result in aggregates of IBEs, which should have in common the ICEs they carry but which are linked by relations that are a product of a shared ancestry of reference carriers and acts of copying. We formalize the identification of these aggregates using the following transitive relations:\n\u2022 x has information descendant copy y just in case x is a Reference Carrier in an Act of Copying that has output y\n\u2022 x has information ancestor copy y just in case y has information descendant copy x\nUsing these relations, we define three types of information aggregates:\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Copies: An Object Aggregate whose members consist of a Reference Carrier and the information descendant copies of that Reference Carrier.\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Duplicates: An Aggregate of Information Carrier Copies all of whose members belong to the aggregate only because of one or more Acts of Duplication.\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Pseudo Duplicates: An Aggregate of Information Carrier Copies whose members belong to the aggregate not only because of one or more Acts of Duplication.\nThese classes and relations in hand, we have resources useful for grouping copies of cyber information according to grades of fidelity.\n5.3. Canonical Information and Faithful Copies\nOur final additions involve the representation of trust with respect to cyber information of the sort we have discussed so far. Our strategy is to approach representing trust through the lens of epistemology, derived from notions of warrant [14] [15] and defeaters [16]: If x is warranted then x is to be trusted as veridical unless there are defeaters for"}, {"content": "trusting x is veridical. A defeater for trusting x is veridical is evidence that either rebuts shows x is not veridical or undercuts - shows reasons for trusting x are questionable.\nThis plausible principle has a closely related analogue relevant to acts of encoding: If x is canonical, then x is to be trusted as a faithful encoding of some intended ICE unless there are defeaters for trusting x as a faithful encoding. This notion of canonicity appears to underwrite many functions in the cyber information domain. Without canonicity, every email received, file opened, or backup restored, should be suspect. Canonicity is thus applicable to copies of information carriers, whether created by a file system or when sending an email, that can be trusted to carry intended information.\nImportantly, canonicity applies to encodings, and thus to IBEs and their concretizing SDCs rather than ICEs. IBEs are what get copied, while ICEs spread when an Act of Copying is successful. Canonicity tells us which copies can be trusted as faithful to their Reference Carriers. Importantly, it does not follow from an IBE's being canonical that it is in fact a faithful copy; just as it does not follow from someone's being trustworthy that they are not lying. Canonicity can be thought of as a nominal measurement of the reliability of some copy as faithful to its reference carrier. If x is measured as canonical, then x is measured as \u201cto be trusted as a faithful copy of its reference carrier, absent defeaters.\"\nFollowing notions of warrant, we take it that a copy of an IBE has a canonical relationship with its Reference Carrier when the following conditions are met:\n1. The relevant information carrier is the output of a vetted copying process designed to, in some environment, reliably output information carriers faithful to the Reference Carrier.\n2. The relevant Act of Copying occurs in a vetted environment designed to facilitate the reliable output of information carriers faithful to the Reference Carriers.\nAn IBE that satisfies each of these conditions is the output of what CPO considers a process of proper functioning, and thus, we should trust that the IBE is a faithful copy of its reference carrier; that is, the IBE is canonical. If these conditions are not met, an IBE may in fact be a faithful copy, but we should not trust it is a faithful copy. With this discussion in mind, we provide (merely) sufficient conditions for the following relations:\n\u2022 x is a canonical copy of y just in case x is the output of an Act of Copying that is a Process of Proper Functioning, y was the Reference Carrier in that Act of Copying, and there are no defeaters for trusting the faithfulness of x as a copy of y.\n\u2022 x has canonical copy y just in case y is a canonical copy of x.\nFurthermore, by establishing an IBE as canonical according to a Reference Carrier, we can also establish that an IBE is canonical according to an Aggregate of Information Carriers. An IBE that is a canonical member of an aggregate represents the ICE(s) that all other members should carry and, depending on the aggregate, what all other members should be like. Here are the relations:\n\u2022 x is a canonical member of y just in case x is the output of an Act of Copying that is a Process of Proper Functioning, and the Reference Carrier of x is the earliest ancestor of Aggregate of Information Carriers y."}, {"content": "\u2022 x has canonical member y just in case y is a canonical member of x.\nThese relations allow for an Act of Copying to have a series of Acts of Copying as occurrent parts, and for one or more IBEs to be the canonical members of the aggregate that is formed because of that series. Consider, when you look at the file size of some document on a computer, the computer likely has numerous redundant copies of that file in storage, and the size the computer shows you is of some canonical member of the aggregate of those files. Of course, not all Acts of Copying transfer canonicity form one copy to another. Sometimes acts of copying are not successful, or a copy gets corrupted- in place, not to mention limitations of copying fidelity.\nImportantly, there are likely other ways to establish some copy as canonical, we have only supplied sufficient conditions. For example, using checksums or other methods of verification apart from assessing the Act of Copying itself. Our goal here was not to be exhaustive, but to introduce the notion of canonicity and discuss its use."}, {"title": "6.

Next steps include applying TACIO terminological content to modeling real-world datasets, as well as more general phenomena, such as in representing encoding errors, unanticipated duplication or transmission of information, and transfer protocols. We anticipate such modeling to result in the construction of additional competency questions and to identify gaps in TACIO coverage. Other steps going forward will include: working with developers of the CCO and C3O in determining which, if any, terms from TACIO should be curated in these respective ontologies and in deciding if any existing content in those ontologies may need to change in light of this research; and applying this work to modeling information processing artifacts and software and their respective functions, especially as it pertains to the manipulation of carriers and the extraction or creation of new content; and the tracking of pedigree and provenance across the digital lifecycle.

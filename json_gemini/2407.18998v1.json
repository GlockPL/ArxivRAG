This paper introduces a set of terms that are intended to act as an interface between cyber\nontologies (like a file system ontology or a data fusion ontology) and top- and mid-level ontologies,\nspecifically Basic Formal Ontology and the Common Core Ontologies. These terms center on what makes\ncyberinformation management unique: numerous acts of copying items of information, the aggregates of\ncopies that result from those acts, and the faithful members of those aggregates that represent all other\nmembers.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "We understand 'cyber information' to refer to information carried by electronic devices,\nanything from copper wire to display monitors to hard drives. The purpose of this paper\nis to describe a set of general terms and semantics for representing cyber information in\nontologies that extend from Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Relations Ontology (RO),\nand the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) [1][2][3].\nTwo caveats regarding the scope of this paper. First, the terms introduced here are\ntoo general and too few to comprise an ontology of their own; their home is presently\nunclear. However, whether they join CCO, one of its extensions, or land elsewhere these\nterms are a step towards allowing CCO to interface with ontologies dealing with cyber\ninformation and its management. Hence, we refer to these terms collectively as Towards\na Cyber Information Ontology (TACIO)2. Second, there is nothing fundamentally\ndifferent about cyber information compared to pen-and-paper information. The\ndifference, rather, is found in the management of cyber information. The backbone of\ncyber information management is rapid copying of information, which is found at all\nlevels of cyberinformation management (e.g., [4] [5]). Compare: you write a letter and\nmail that letter to a recipient; you write an email, and that email is copied, that copy is\ncopied, and so on until a copy arrives on the intended recipient's machine. Hence, the\nfocus in TACIO on terms for the copying, duplicating, and pseudo copying of\ninformation.\nWhy build an interface for cyber ontologies to extend from CCO? As an extension\nof the BFO/CCO suite, a cyber information ontology gains interoperability with\nontologies spanning medicine, biology, manufacturing, defense, and intelligence. Such\ninteroperability is of high value given the importance and ubiquity of cyber information.\nWe leave it to electrical engineers, physicists, and other relevant subject matter experts\nto make use of this interface by building more specific ontologies, like an ontology of"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "Transmission of information across cyber information systems will be better understood,\nmodeled with higher precision, and engender greater trust among users, if the rather\nopaque nature of the domain were adequately represented in widely used ontologies such\nas BFO and CCO. While at least one ontology exists that is designed to represent the\ndomain of data fusion [6], none do so by extending from a modular suite of upper- and\nmid-level ontologies. Ontologies that do not conform to standardized architecture are\nlimited in their interoperability, scalability, and ability to aid information extrapolation\nfrom diverse data sets. Crucially, as more ontologies are developed that use the same\nupper-levels, and themselves reused in other applications, there occurs a community-\ndriven stepwise improvement of the reused ontologies. Importantly, ontologies that\nfacilitate interoperability among all-source data may provide valuable machine-learning\nassessments of iterative data fusion pipelines, whereby slices of a pipeline are evaluated\nto discover how best to compose optimal pipelines, as evidenced in intelligence analysis\napproaches [7]. It is challenging to see how such assessment might be conducted without\ninteroperability.\nA concrete example of the need for TACIO is the current state of The Common Core\nCyber Ontology (C3O) [8]. C3O is designed to represent entities relevant to the cyber\ndomain [9]. It contains a mix of high-level terms, such as Computer Program, Computer\nNetwork, Computer Language, Digital File, as well a mix of more specific terms, e.g.,\nPacket Header, Ethernet Cord, and Botnet. While some C3O terms are relevant to\ninformation processing and transfer, like Data Synchronization Utility and File\nCompressor, none explicitly characterize information tracing and authenticity validation\nthrough transformations, encodings, and manipulations of data over their digital lifespan.\nThere is, moreover, no unifying set of terms and semantics available to C3O for\nrepresenting different kinds of encoding in the cyber domain. Thus, while C3O is in\ngeneral expressively rich, coverage could be improved. We intend TACIO to supplement\nC3O, provide motivation for refining C3O terms, and support C3O extensions, especially\nfusion-related applications.\nOur work is guided by the CCO approach to modeling information.3 CCO's\napproach to information distinguishes the content of information both from the artifacts\nwhich carry it and from the patterns exhibited by those artifacts. The screen of a computer\nmonitor, for example, is an artifact that bears patterns - patterns of shapes and colors -\nthat concretize information content. These distinctions allow the flexible relationship\nbetween artifacts, patterns, and information content to be represented. Consider, your\nmonitor screen could bear any of the following distinct patterns: '\u03c0', 'pi', '3.14...', or\n\u20183.14159265358979323...', and all of these would concretize (and convey) the same\ninformation content, assuming certain conventions in the language of contemporary\nmathematics. Similarly, an iPad screen might exhibit smaller patterns which also carry\n(and convey) the same information. Likewise, an assistive device could concretize (and\nconvey) the same information content, using acoustic patterns to convey what is also\ncarried by the patterns on screen."}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "Our starting point was the top-level ontology BFO and the mid-level CCO suite. BFO\nwas imported in full, but not all modules in the CCO suite were needed. Additionally, an\nextension of CCO, the Cognitive Process Ontology (CPO), was imported [10]. CPO was\nbuilt from prior ontological work [11] [12] and provides terms useful for modeling\nmental processing [9]. The latter has been used to model intelligence analyst workflows\nand processes of forming and asserting trustworthy medical diagnoses [8] [13].\nCharacterization of trustworthy transmission of information among analysts and\nphysicians is a special case of trustworthy transmission of information generally. As the\nlatter is within the scope of cyber information, and more specifically of data fusion,\ndomains, importing CPO is warranted for our project. On the other hand, the C3O was\nnot imported."}, {"title": "3.2. Competency Questions", "content": "Competency questions provide a foundation for evaluating expressivity of the\nterminological content and aid in evaluating the intended scope of the ontology. Our\ncompetency questions, including examples, which drive our project are:\n1. What entities are involved in the spread of information from one information\nbearer to another?\na. An email is sent from a laptop to a personal computer.\nb. Information stored on a solid-state drive is displayed on a monitor.\nc. A file system snapshot is stored on a backup drive.\n2. What entities are involved in the spread of information from multi-modal\ninformation bearers to a target?\na. Acoustic and image traffic data are sent from field sensors to a controller\nwhich adjusts the timing of traffic light changes.\nb. Bathymetric, meteorological, and temperature data are sent to a dataset for\ntracking marine life.\n3. What relationship exists among information bearers participating in the spread\nof information from a source?\na. Relationships among 10 machines that receive an email from a single\nmachine.\nb. Relationships among distinct drives storing identical snapshots of a system.\n4. What entities are involved in spreading information according to standard\ntransmission protocols?\na. A password is submitted over an encrypted Secure Socket Layer\nconnection.\nb. A password is submitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection.\n5. What relationships exist among information entities under version control\nwhich correspond to a single, current, version?\na. Two authors collaborating on a paper using Google Docs.\nb. A developer accessing code on a GitHub repository, from distinct machines."}, {"title": "4. Results", "content": "The preceding competency questions were used to guide the use of terms from imported\nontologies during our first experiment. After observing gaps in the expressivity of our\nterminology, we introduced additional terminological content needed to adequately\nanswer the competency questions. The competency questions were then used to validate\nour results in a second experiment.\nThe top-level terminological content found in Table 1 was observed to be\nsufficient to model, at a high level, information content, the carriers of that content, and\nthe features that encode that content, and in this regard, was found suitable to act as an\ninterface between the BFO/CCO suite and a cyber ontology. However, these terms,\nthough necessary, were not sufficient to model the managing and transmission of cyber\ninformation."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "Cyber information systems spread ICEs by creating copies of IBEs which carry the same\ncontent. For example, emailing involves using a sender's IBE as reference in a copying"}, {"title": "5.1. Acts of Encoding", "content": "process which produces a distinct IBE on the recipient's machine. If successful, each\nIBE carries the same ICE.\nTo capture these phenomena, we first introduce the term Act of Encoding: An\nIntentional Act whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity to carry some intended\nInformation Content Entity. As an intentional act, any instance of Act of Encoding\ninvolves an agent intentionally arranging, manipulating, or creating some material entity\nfor the purpose of carrying specific information content. This class is broad enough to\ninclude writing in a notebook, using fireworks to display a message, as well as an agent\nusing a computer to manipulate magnetic fields to store information. This term thus\naccommodates ways in which cyber information systems manipulate IBEs to store,\nprotect, or transmit ICEs.\nWe moreover introduce a subclass of Act of Encoding, Act of Copying: An Act of\nEncoding whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity with the intention that this Material\nEntity carry the same ICE as some Reference Carrier. Consequently, we also introduce\nReference Carrier: A material entity that is the input to an Act of Copying and that carries\nthe ICE intended to be carried by the output of that Act of Copying. Thus, if the ICE\ncarried by the output Material Entity is the same ICE carried by the Reference Carrier,\nthen the Act of Copying is successful. For example, if I copy a quote from a book by\nhand, then part of the book is the Reference Carrier, and, if what I copy by hand carries\nthe same ICE as the relevant part of the book, then the Act of Copying was successful.\nSimilarly, if an ICE carried by a portion of my laptop is sent to some recipient, then this\nAct of Copying is successful if the process outputs a Material Entity (in this case, part of\nthe recipient's laptop), which carries the same ICE as was carried by the relevant portion\nof my laptop. (Note, to be clear, a failed, or unsuccessful, act of copying is one where\nthe output IBE carries an ICE different from the Reference Carrier. There is no such\nthing as an Act of Copying where there is no output.)\nOf course, Acts of Copying may spread information across different carrier types,\nlike copying notes from paper to chalk board, inputting handwritten manuscripts into a\nword processor, or an operating systems' copying content from persistent storage to\nRAM. To represent such processes, we introduce Act of Information Carrier Transition:\nAn Act of Copying whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity that is of a type different\nfrom the Reference Carrier, but which bears the same type of concretizing SDCs.\nCopying may also spread information across distinct types of concretizing SDCs.\nSome potential examples include changing the font type of a text, translating a text into\nan equally expressive language, and performing certain algebraic operations in\nmathematics. This motivates the introduction of Act of Concretizer Transition: An Act\nof Copying whereby an Agent forms a Material Entity that bears concretizing SDCs of\ntypes distinct from those inhering in the Reference Carrier, but where that Material Entity\nis of the same type.\nThere are also many cases where the carrier and the concretizers both transition. For\nexample, consider a voice-to-text application that transitions information concretized by\npatterns of acoustic waves to, say, a binary pattern of electromagnetic features inhering\nin a machine. Hence, we introduce Act of Carrier and Concretizer Transition: An Act of\nCopying that is both an Act of Information Carrier Transition and an Act of Concretizer\nTransition. Notably, this is a defined class, characterized entirely in terms of other\nTACIO classes.\nSome Acts of Copying spread information by duplication, where a Material Entity\nis produced that is exactly similar (or something relevantly close to this) as the reference\ncarrier; in the parlance previously used, there is no transition at all. For example, a file"}, {"title": "5.2. Aggregates of Information Carriers", "content": "Acts of Copying result in aggregates of IBEs, which should have in common the ICEs\nthey carry but which are linked by relations that are a product of a shared ancestry of\nreference carriers and acts of copying. We formalize the identification of these\naggregates using the following transitive relations:\n\u2022 x has information descendant copy y just in case x is a Reference Carrier in an\nAct of Copying that has output y\n\u2022 x has information ancestor copy y just in case y has information descendant\ncopy x\nUsing these relations, we define three types of information aggregates:\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Copies: An Object Aggregate whose members\nconsist of a Reference Carrier and the information descendant copies of that\nReference Carrier.\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Duplicates: An Aggregate of Information\nCarrier Copies all of whose members belong to the aggregate only because of\none or more Acts of Duplication.\n\u2022 Aggregate of Information Carrier Pseudo Duplicates: An Aggregate of\nInformation Carrier Copies whose members belong to the aggregate not only\nbecause of one or more Acts of Duplication.\nThese classes and relations in hand, we have resources useful for grouping copies of\ncyber information according to grades of fidelity."}, {"title": "5.3.

Application", "content": "Here we apply the new terminological content using SPARQL to answer question 2a\nfrom the list of competency questions above:\n2. What entities are involved in the spread of information from multi-modal\ninformation bearers to a target?\na. Acoustic and image traffic data are sent from a field sensors to a controller\nwhich adjusts the timing of traffic light changes.\nThe question concerns the spreading and fusing of information from distinct sources with\ndistinct types of carriers and concretizers. The query demonstrates the way the new\nterminological content can model carriers, their information content, and the various\nrelationships between. In this query we exploit the fact that descendent and ancestor\ncopies share information content. This is but one way this competency question could\nhave been answered."}, {"title": "6. Future Direction", "content": "We have taken first steps here towards modeling cyber information using high-level\nterms in a manner conformant to widely used top and mid-level ontologies. As described,\nthe conformance of TACIO terminological content allows for interoperability with\napproximately 400 BFO-based ontologies. Because the cyber domain cuts across\ndomains such as biology, education, manufacturing, and so on, the interoperability of\nTACIO with existing ontologies provides significant, wide-ranging, content of the sort\nthat TACIO terminological content is about.\nWe welcome the participation of those who are experts in the cyber, defense, and\nintelligence domains, as we refine TACIO terminological content, and encourage\ncontributions through the TACIO GitHub project page. Next steps include applying\nTACIO terminological content to modeling real-world datasets, as well as more general\nphenomena, such as in representing encoding errors, unanticipated duplication or\ntransmission of information, and transfer protocols. We anticipate such modeling to\nresult in the construction of additional competency questions and to identify gaps in\nTACIO coverage. Other steps going forward will include: working with developers of\nthe CCO and C3O in determining which, if any, terms from TACIO should be curated\nin these respective ontologies and in deciding if any existing content in those ontologies\nmay need to change in light of this research; and applying this work to modeling\ninformation processing artifacts and software and their respective functions, especially\nas it pertains to the manipulation of carriers and the extraction or creation of new content;\nand the tracking of pedigree and provenance across the digital lifecycle. Our refinements\ncan only be improved through consultation with additional subject matter experts and\nontologists invested in coordinating cyber information data."}]}

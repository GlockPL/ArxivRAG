INTRODUCTION", "content": "Millions of annual U.S. car accidents result mainly from human error, causing 35,000 fatalities and over $871 billion in damages [1]. To address this, Tesla pioneered autonomous vehicle systems like \"Autopilot\" to eliminate human mistakes and the need for operators in their cars. The rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology is reshaping the transportation landscape, offering increased ease and security but presenting moral dilemmas, exemplified by the fatal incident between Joshua Brown and Tesla's Autopilot system [2][3]. Mr. Brown's sudden death on May 7, 2016, when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor-trailer in Autopilot mode, underscores the ethical concerns associated with new technological frontiers, mainly when human lives are involved. Tesla reported the first recorded death in over 130 million Autopilot miles, a remarkable contrast to the approximately 94 million miles between fatalities on U.S. roads [4]. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) initiated an assessment, emphasizing the need to determine if the technology performed as expected. Tesla promptly notified the NHTSA, detailing a unique incident on a divided highway where a tractor-trailer crossed the road, resulting in the Model S passing under the trailer and impacting the windshield. The accident occurred as Joshua Brown's Model S traveled east on US-27A, a divided highway in northern Florida. A tractor-trailer, traveling in the opposite direction on the highway, turned left in front of the Tesla. The Tesla was in Autopilot mode. According to Tesla Motors, \"Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied\" [3]. The trailer was high enough off the ground that the car continued under it, shearing off its roof. The car drove off the road and struck two fences and a power pole before stopping. The core issue in Joshua Brown's fatal collision with Tesla's Autopilot system involves the ethical implications of autonomous driving technology. Tesla Motors' ethical responsibilities in implementing and advertising a system requiring constant human supervision, despite being labeled Autopilot, raise concerns about user awareness, safety precautions, and the moral shift from driver assistance to partial automation. Non-ethical aspects, such as technological and legal restrictions, add complexity, necessitating a careful analysis of the Autopilot system's operation and regulatory frameworks. This essay employs a seven-step ethical decision-making framework [5] to thoroughly examine Tesla Motors' moral responsibilities as a leader in autonomous driving technology. Beyond case details, the analysis underscores the significant consequences for the automotive industry, emphasizing the importance of aligning moral principles and legal systems with advancing technology in a future where humans and machines share the road."}, {"title": "II. ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK", "content": "Navigating the moral complexities of Tesla's Autopilot system requires meticulous attention. This section employs a structured seven-step process, used in this study, to analyze the moral implications of autonomous driving technology, covered in the I Introduction, II-A Gathering and assessing relevant facts, II-B Identifying stakeholders, II-C Developing a list of five options, II-D Testing options, and combining the 6th and 7th steps, i.e, tentative and final choices to tackle the problem, in the V Conclusion. Following Joshua Brown's tragic incident, each step in this framework serves as a tool to illuminate Tesla Motors' moral responsibility, providing insights beyond the case's specifics for guiding moral decision-making in the dynamic field of technological innovation."}, {"title": "A. Gathering and Accessing Relevant Facts", "content": "Several academic investigations have explored the ethical aspects of the development of autonomous vehicles, with a primary emphasis on imbuing these systems with human ethical standards [6][7]. These studies compare ethical conundrums people face and possible obstacles to widely adopted self-driving automobiles. Nonetheless, there is a crucial void in these conversations since they frequently need to focus more on in-depth analyses of the design process and how people incorporate their moral principles into technology, impacting how society interacts with and uses it. One particular study, \"The Ethics of Crashes with Self-Driving Cars: A Roadmap,\" [8] delves into the initial stages of autonomous vehicle testing by prominent tech firms such as Google, Uber, and Tesla. The author draws attention to the different perspectives these corporations hold about the degree of accountability placed on them and how cars should handle moral conundrums when they are about to happen. According to the author, these contradictions indicate a need for more well-defined ethical protocols and preparedness for self-driving cars. Specifically, the author highlights the lack of standard operating guidelines for vehicle algorithms in crash situations with potentially fatal consequences. When discussing accident algorithms for self-driving cars, the author cautions against ignoring essential moral and legal accountability issues. Another study, \"Self-Driving Vehicles an Ethical Overview,\" [9], addresses the potential responsibility gap in a road system with autonomous vehicles. The authors argue that assigning blame solely to the car owner, who may not control the autonomous vehicle, becomes challenging. Accountability is not confined to manufacturer guidelines or the car's intelligence system. Determining fault in a car accident becomes complex due to varying circumstances and damages. The paper emphasizes how societal decisions significantly impact ethical consequences, stressing the need for a systematic approach to ethics in self-driving car technology. While these academic studies offer insightful analysis of potential moral conundrums about AI and autonomous driving, there still needs to be a critical vacuum in understanding how ethical considerations should be incorporated into the design."}, {"title": "B.

Through semi-structured interviews with professional composers, we gathered insights on a novel generative model for creating variations, highlighting concerns around trust, transparency, and ethical design. The findings helped form a feedback loop, guiding improvements to the model that emphasised traceability, transparency and explainability. They also revealed new areas for innovation, including novel features for controllability and research questions on the ethical and practical implementation of GenAI models.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Generative AI (GenAI) in creative fields faces challenges due to a divide between human-centric and model-centric research approaches, reflecting a broader disconnect between AI researchers and creative professionals overall, which we highlight in the music domain [13, 17, 1]. Concerns about trust, ethics, and usability stress a need for interdisciplinary dialogue, which can be used to help guide the development of GenAI tools that meet real-world needs. To address this in the music domain, we conducted a qualitative study with professional composers, exploring how generative music models can serve as creative aids in music composition. Through semi-structured interviews, composers interacted with a baseline transformer model designed to create musical variations [15, 14], providing feedback on outputs, evaluation metrics, transparency, and ethical concerns. This approach established a feedback loop that helps to inform GenAI tool design and foundational research questions, aligning AI development with the practical and ethical needs of end-users. Although centred on music, our findings offer valuable insights for broader applications of GenAI in creative contexts."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Our methodology employed a User-Centred and Participatory Design-based approach [2, 16, 10, 8, 11]. Four professional composers participated in semi-structured interviews, where they were introduced to a novel music task, Music Overpainting, using a transformer model designed to generate jazz piano variations from basic melodies and chords [14, 15]. Adapted from the music transformer architecture proposed by Huang et al. [9], this model serves as a task-specific baseline for Music Overpainting. Composers could listen to the model's inputs and outputs as much as needed to familiarise themselves with its capabilities. We asked targeted questions for their opinions on how to define a variation, the success of the model, trust and ethical concerns, user integration and controllability aspects as detailed in Appendix A.1. These questions helped to address critical aspects of"}, {"title": "Findings and Discussion", "content": "The key findings from engaging with professional composers, along with the considerations that influenced the model's development, are summarised in Table 1. This table highlights the main themes identified during the study, the specific feedback from composers (see example transcripts in Appendix A.2), and the resulting design decisions and adjustments made to the model."}, {"title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "Looking ahead, extending this approach to other GenAI domains can lay the groundwork for interdisciplinary collaborations that prioritise user-centred AI design. We urge the research community to adopt continuous engagement with end-users, explore innovative features, and focus on designing AI systems that genuinely support and enhance artistic workflows, striking a balance between AI as a creative agent, the needs of the creative community, and the evolving technical landscape of AI development."}]}

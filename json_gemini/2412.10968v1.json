Through semi-structured interviews with professional composers, we gathered insights on a novel generative model for creating variations, highlighting concerns around trust, transparency, and ethical design. The findings helped form a feedback loop, guiding improvements to the model that emphasised traceability, transparency and explainability. They also revealed new areas for innovation, including novel features for controllability and research questions on the ethical and practical implementation of GenAI models.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Generative AI (GenAI) in creative fields faces challenges due to a divide between human-centric and model-centric research approaches, reflecting a broader disconnect between AI researchers and creative professionals overall, which we highlight in the music domain [13, 17, 1]. Concerns about trust, ethics, and usability stress a need for interdisciplinary dialogue, which can be used to help guide the development of GenAI tools that meet real-world needs. To address this in the music domain, we conducted a qualitative study with professional composers, exploring how generative music models can serve as creative aids in music composition. Through semi-structured interviews, composers interacted with a baseline transformer model designed to create musical variations [15, 14], providing feedback on outputs, evaluation metrics, transparency, and ethical concerns. This approach established a feedback loop that helps to inform GenAI tool design and foundational research questions, aligning AI development with the practical and ethical needs of end-users. Although centred on music, our findings offer valuable insights for broader applications of GenAI in creative contexts."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Our methodology employed a User-Centred and Participatory Design-based approach [2, 16, 10, 8, 11]. Four professional composers participated in semi-structured interviews, where they were introduced to a novel music task, Music Overpainting, using a transformer model designed to generate jazz piano variations from basic melodies and chords [14, 15]. Adapted from the music transformer architecture proposed by Huang et al. [9], this model serves as a task-specific baseline for Music Overpainting. Composers could listen to the model's inputs and outputs as much as needed to familiarise themselves with its capabilities. We asked targeted questions for their opinions on how to define a variation, the success of the model, trust and ethical concerns, user integration and controllability aspects as detailed in Appendix A.1. These questions helped to address critical aspects of"}, {"title": "Findings and Discussion", "content": "The key findings from engaging with professional composers, along with the considerations that influenced the model's development, are summarised in Table 1. This table highlights the main themes identified during the study, the specific feedback from composers (see example transcripts in Appendix A.2), and the resulting design decisions and adjustments made to the model. We used composer feedback to improve the same generative variation model introduced in the study. Key concerns around trust, transparency, and ethical design were raised. The findings helped to clarify the generative task which had been defined through researcher bias, and exposed gaps in existing evaluation metrics for new creative tasks, revealing a need for subjective and objective criteria that reflect real-world creative practices. Feedback also emphasised traceability around data collection and model outputs, and explainability as essential for building trust and aligning AI outputs with artistic intentions [5, 6]. While many of the themes identified in Table 1 align with domain-general principles from fields like Human-Centred AI (HCAI)\u2014 such as interpretability, explainability, and data transparency [18] the direct feedback from composers added a complementary, application-specific perspective, and helped to reveal how the straightforward application of domain-general principles may overlook subtle requirements unique to certain creative tasks. For instance, composers expressed a strong desire for traceability, viewing it not only as a means to track how variations related to, and evolved from the source material but also as a way to support their creative choices. Some suggested that having"}, {"title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "Looking ahead, extending this approach to other GenAI domains can lay the groundwork for inter-disciplinary collaborations that prioritise user-centred AI design. We urge the research community to adopt continuous engagement with end-users, explore innovative features, and focus on designing AI systems that genuinely support and enhance artistic workflows, striking a balance between AI as a creative agent, the needs of the creative community, and the evolving technical landscape of AI development."}, {"title": "Appendix / supplemental material", "content": "Participants were asked fifteen semi-structured questions designed to encourage open dialogue and facilitate in-depth discussions. The semi-structured format allowed participants to freely express their thoughts and opinions, fostering a conversational environment. The questions focused on the participants' understanding of variations in music, their perceptions of AI-generated outputs, and potential improvements for AI tools in creative workflows."}]}

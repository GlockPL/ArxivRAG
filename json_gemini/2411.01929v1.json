However, acquiring real-world data poses challenges due to privacy concerns, limited accessibility, and potential biases [Lu et al., 2024]. Consequently, synthetic data generation has attracted increasing interest, aiming to create diverse and representative datasets that mitigate issues of data scarcity, bias, and privacy [Abadi et al., 2016].\nIn recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful technique for producing realistic synthetic data [Goodfellow et al., 2014]. GANs are widely applied in fields such as image generation, network traffic modeling, and healthcare data synthesis [Antoniou et al., 2018]. These models replicate the statistical properties of real-world data, providing a valuable tool for augmenting datasets in cases where data is limited or sensitive [Ring et al., 2019a]."}, {"title": "Techniques", "content": "Here we describe our techniques for data generation and training the generators as language-based classifiers.

CICFlowmeter is a bi-directional flow generator and analyzer for Ethernet traffic, specifically designed for anomaly detection in cybersecurity datasets.\nCICFlowmeter has been extensively used in well-known cybersecurity datasets, including:\n\u2022 Android Adware-General Malware dataset (CICAAGM2017),\n\u2022 IPS/IDS dataset (CICIDS2017),\n\u2022 Android Malware dataset (CICAndMal2017), and\n\u2022 Distributed Denial of Service (CICDDoS2019).\nBy leveraging CICFlowmeter, we extracted 80 features from each flow, compiling a comprehensive set of flow-based features in CSV format. This structured tabular data includes attributes such as source and destination IP addresses, transport protocols, port numbers, byte and packet counts, TCP flags, and other network metrics.\nThe conversion of network flows into structured tabular data is crucial for our approach, as it allows for systematic analysis and modeling. The resulting dataset, with its rich set of 80 features, provides the necessary structured format for advanced machine learning techniques, enabling effective synthetic data generation while preserving relationships between features. Structured data in this format facilitates the use of sequence models and other generative techniques that rely on well-organized, tabular data representations [Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015]."}, {"title": "Data Transformation to Text Domain - Symbolic Encoding", "content": "Our preliminary exploratory data analysis revealed significant complexity within the dataset, as evidenced by high variance in certain features and the considerable number of unique values across columns. This complexity makes the dataset unsuitable for traditional statistical sampling or simple data synthesis techniques, supporting the exploration of advanced synthetic data generation models.\nTo enhance the representational quality and address the challenges posed by this complexity, we applied a novel encoding strategy, transforming the dataset from a numeric to a symbolic, textual domain. Specifically, each numeric feature was discretized into intervals, with each interval represented by one of 49 unique symbols. Each symbol corresponds to a 1% range of the respective feature's values, resulting in a robust dataset of 30,000 examples. Each example can be considered analogous to a sentence in the symbolic domain [Vaswani et al., 2023].\nThis transformation repositions the data generation task as a classification problem rather than continuous regression. By encoding each data point as a sequence of symbols, we frame the task as the prediction of the next symbol in a sequence, given a preceding set of symbols, analogous to language modeling tasks in NLP [Bengio et al., 2000]. The dataset, now framed in a discrete symbolic space, facilitates the use of classification algorithms designed for categorical outputs, aligning well with sequence models."}, {"title": "Problem Framing", "content": "Our study frames the data generation task as the prediction of the next symbol in a sequence, given the current token. Let x represent the current token, and y the next symbol to be predicted. The probability mass function (PMF) for the random variable y, conditioned on x, is given by $P(y|x)$, where $P(y|x)$ represents the probability of the next symbol y, given the current token x. Our goal is to maximize $P(y = ytrue|x)$, where $ytrue$ is the true label of the next token.\nWe frame this task as a classification problem, not a regression problem. Although one might bypass text transformation by regressing the output directly, regression introduces challenges, especially when managing high-dimensional, continuous outputs with complex data structures [He et al., 2015a].\nClassification, by contrast, allows the model to discretize decision-making and capture the data's discrete nature effectively. In cases where classes occupy distinct manifolds within the data space, classification models can partition the space, yielding probabilistic predictions and clearer boundaries."}, {"title": "Overview of Sequence Models Employed in Our Study", "content": ""}, {"title": "WaveNet-Enhanced Neural Probabilistic Language Model", "content": "We employed the WaveNet architecture to enhance a neural probabilistic language model, leveraging its capability to capture intricate sequential dependencies within data.

By integrating the WaveNet architecture, developed by Google [van den Oord et al., 2016], we extend this foundational approach.\nWaveNet's use of causal convolutions ensures temporal consistency in predictions\u2014essential for modeling sequential data tasks.

Each Transformer block includes multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization, supporting robust learning of input sequences."}, {"title": "Experiment Setup - Framework for Generating Synthetic Data", "content": "This section outlines the models used to create a novel framework for generating synthetic data. We detail the rationale behind selecting these models, discuss the appropriate loss functions, and highlight best practices in training for optimal performance. Additionally, we examine trade-offs involved in generating synthetic data, focusing on aspects of realism, diversity, and privacy preservation."}, {"title": "Building Intuition", "content": "The proposed framework is based on the concept of N-gram models [Cavnar and Trenkle, 2001]. It involves sampling from a distribution where each character is characterized by a conditional probability over the previous n \u2013 1 characters.\nMathematically, this is represented as:\n$P(C_i | C_{i-(n-1)},..., C_{i-1})$\nThis approach has limitations, such as failing to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Additionally, as n increases, the number of possible N-grams grows exponentially, leading to data sparsity and many zero-count N-grams if the training data is insufficient.\nOur approach builds upon Bengio's work on Neural Probabilistic Language Models, where he proposed a neural network architecture to learn the probability distribution of word sequences [Bengio et al., 2000]. By integrating these ideas with the WaveNet architecture, known for its strong performance in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, we aim to develop a powerful language model capable of generating highly realistic and diversified synthetic text data [van den Oord et al., 2016].\nTo clarify our methodological choices, we provide intuition behind adopting Bengio's neural network approach and emphasize its advantages in our context.\nBengio's neural network represents each word with a sampled vector and feeds it into a neural network that predicts the next word in the sequence. This prediction is achieved by turning the logits into a distribution via the softmax function, allowing sampling from this distribution. The network learns both the network parameters and the sampled distribution.\nBuilding on this, we introduce WaveNet. Bengio's approach squashes the input through the network, making it difficult to learn long-term dependencies and positional information. In contrast, WaveNet heavily relies on dilated causal convolutions, specifically designed to capture long-term dependencies by applying multiple large dilated convolutions in parallel.\nMathematically, a dilated convolution operation for a sequence x with filter f is defined as:\n$y(t) = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\sum_{} f(k) \\cdot x(t-r\\cdot k)$"}, {"title": "Loss", "content": "For generative tasks, where we predict the next character in a sequence from a distribution, cross-entropy loss is commonly used. This loss measures the difference between the true distribution and the predicted distribution for each packet (sequence) in the dataset.\nTo compute the loss over an entire sequence of packets, we sum the cross-entropy loss over all characters (or time steps) within each sequence, and then average the loss over all sequences in the dataset. The cross-entropy loss for the dataset can be defined as:\n$L_{cross-entropy} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{i,j} log(\\hat{y}_{i,j})$"}, {"title": "Training Practices", "content": "Generative models require additional care to ensure they produce high-quality and realistic synthetic data. Our framework includes best practices to address these needs effectively.\nTo address tanh issues in Bengio's approach, we reference He et al. [2015a]. During the forward pass, the activations passing through the tanh layer tend to be extreme, often lying on the tails at either positive one or negative one.\nDuring the backward pass, when neurons with tanh activation function update their weights, they often encounter a zero gradient. Consequently, in the update step:\n$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y_j}$ \nthe neuron behaves in a shut-off mode due to a zero gradient, resulting in no weight change. To address this, we manage the standard distribution of activations entering the tanh activated layer to have a gain of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{fan_{in}}}$ allowing the neurons to learn normally.\nFor covariant shift resulting from high-dimensional datasets (curse of dimensionality), we apply batch normalization [Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015] as best practice for normalizing the flow (backward and forward) [Wu and Johnson, 2021]. For a layer with d-dimensional input x = ($x^{(1)}, ..., x^{(d)}$), we normalize each dimension $x^{(k)}$ as follows:\n$X_{norm}^{(k)} = \\frac{x^{(k)} - E[x^{(k)}]}{\\sqrt{Var[x^{(k)}]}}$"}, {"title": "Statistical Framework for Testing Generative Examples", "content": "We posit that if the distribution of generated data closely aligns with the real data distribution, it should effectively train machine learning models. To assess this, we can train a separate classifier on real data to evaluate the statistical validity of the generated data. Logically, training machine learning systems on synthetic data that closely mirrors real data should not harm performance."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "In our experiments, we evaluated each model's ability to generate synthetic data that closely aligns with the original data distribution. The primary evaluation metric was the percentage of inliers, defined as the proportion of generated data points that fall within the distribution of the original data.\nThe results indicate that while all models performed well, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) achieved the highest percentage of inliers at 87.9%, followed by the Transformer-based Decoder at 84.9%. WaveNet, although effective in modeling long-range dependencies, had the lowest inlier rate at 69.2%, likely due to its convolutional structure, which may not capture certain complex dependencies as efficiently as the RNN and Transformer models."}, {"title": "Synthetic Data Generation: A Survey", "content": "Synthetic data generation has emerged as a vital solution in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, offering unique advantages for both research and practical applications.

As researchers transition synthetic data from the laboratory to practical implementations, its real-world applications continue to expand. This section examines several notable domains where synthetic data generation substantially impacts addressing real-world challenges."}, {"title": "Vision", "content": "Generating synthetic data for computer vision tasks has proven highly effective, as it allows for the creation of large, diverse datasets that can be used to train models without the need for costly and time-consuming data collection efforts [Marwala et al., 2023]. These synthetically generated datasets can capture a wide range of scenarios, including complex lighting conditions, occlusions, and diverse object appearances, which are crucial for developing robust vision-based systems. GANs and other generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing such high-quality synthetic data [Azizi et al., 2023, Nikolenko, 2019, Mumuni et al., 2024].\nIn computer vision, manual labeling remains essential for certain tasks [Zhao et al., 2021]. However, tasks like segmentation, depth estimation, and optical flow estimation can be particularly arduous to label manually due to their inherent complexity. To alleviate this burden, synthetic data has become a transformative tool, streamlining the labeling process significantly [Chen et al., 2019].\nSankaranarayanan et al. proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed to bridge the gap between embeddings in the learned feature space, which is instrumental in Visual Domain Adaptation [Sankaranarayanan et al., 2017]. This methodology enables semantic segmentation across varied domains by using a generator to map features onto the image space, allowing the discriminator to operate effectively on these projections. The discriminator's output serves as the basis for adversarial losses [Dong and Yang, 2019]. Research has demonstrated that applying adversarial losses to the projected image space consistently outperforms applications to the feature space alone, yielding notably enhanced performance [Sankaranarayanan et al., 2018].\nIn a recent study, a team at Microsoft Research validated the efficacy of synthetic data in face-related tasks by leveraging a parametric 3D face model, enriched with a comprehensive library of hand-crafted assets [Wood et al., 2021]. This approach allowed for the rendering of training images with high levels of realism and diversity. The researchers demonstrated that machine learning models trained on synthetic data achieved accuracy comparable to models trained on real data for tasks like landmark localization and face parsing. Notably, synthetic data alone was sufficient for robust face detection in unconstrained environments [Wood et al., 2021]."}, {"title": "Voice", "content": "The synthetic voice industry is at the cutting edge of technological progress, evolving at an unprecedented rate. The rise of machine learning and deep learning has enabled the creation of synthetic voices for applications like video production, digital assistants, and video games [Werchniak et al., 2021], making the process more accessible and accurate than ever. This field lies at the intersection of multiple domains, including acoustics, linguistics, and signal processing. Researchers continuously seek to enhance the accuracy and naturalness of synthetic voices. As technology continues to advance, synthetic voices are expected to become increasingly integrated into daily life, offering valuable support across various domains and enriching user experiences [Werchniak et al., 2021].\nEarlier research involved spectral modeling techniques for statistical parametric speech synthesis, utilizing low-level, unmodified spectral envelope parameters for generating synthetic voices. These spectral envelopes are represented through graphical models with multiple hidden variables, incorporating structures like restricted Boltzmann machines and deep belief networks (DBNs) [Fu et al., 2014]. Enhancements to traditional hidden Markov model (HMM)-based speech synthesis systems have shown substantial improvements in achieving a more natural sound while reducing oversmoothing effects [Ling et al., 2013]."}, {"title": "Business", "content": "The risk of compromising or exposing original data remains a constant concern, especially in the business sector, where strict restrictions govern data sharing both within and beyond the organization. This has led to an increased focus on developing financial datasets that replicate the characteristics of \"real data\u201d while safeguarding the privacy of all parties involved.\nAlthough technologies such as encryption, anonymization, and advanced privacy-preserving methods have been employed to secure original data [Mannino and Abouzied, 2019], residual risks persist. Data-derived information can sometimes still be used to trace individuals, thus compromising privacy [Assefa et al., 2021]. Synthetic data offers a compelling solution by removing the need to expose sensitive data, effectively ensuring privacy and security for both companies and their customers [Mannino and Abouzied, 2019]. Additionally, synthetic data allows organizations faster data access by circumventing certain privacy and security protocols.\nHistorically, institutions with large data reserves were well-positioned to assist decision-makers in tackling a range of issues. However, even internal data access was often restricted due to confidentiality concerns. Today, companies leverage synthetic data to refresh and model original datasets, generating ongoing insights that drive organizational performance improvements [Hittmeir et al., 2019]."}, {"title": "Privacy Risks and Prevention", "content": "Synthetic data generation has emerged as a key solution for data privacy and sharing in sectors where sensitive data cannot be disclosed, such as clinical, genomic, and financial domains. However, the generation of synthetic data that preserves the statistical properties of real datasets introduces privacy risks, as models may unintentionally expose underlying patterns, thereby compromising individual privacy. Membership inference attacks, for example, can identify whether specific data points were included in the training set, posing significant privacy concerns. To address these risks, privacy-enhancing methods fall into two primary categories: anonymization-based approaches and differential privacy (DP) methods.\nAnonymization techniques, including k-anonymity and nearest marginal sanitization, replace sensitive information with fictitious yet realistic data, providing foundational privacy protection, though often lacking rigorous guarantees. Differential privacy methods, on the other hand, offer more robust protection by introducing noise to data, thus maintaining privacy while preserving data utility. Advanced implementations, such as GAN-based DP models (e.g., DPGAN and PATE-GAN) and local differential privacy (LDP) frameworks, support secure synthetic data generation, particularly in distributed contexts.\nAlongside privacy, fairness in synthetic data is increasingly critical, as models trained on biased datasets may unfairly represent minority groups, reinforcing existing disparities. Three main approaches address fairness in synthetic data: preprocessing, which adjusts input data to remove correlations with sensitive attributes; in-processing, which incorporates fairness constraints during model training; and post-processing, which adjusts model predictions to enhance equity. Preprocessing remains the most commonly applied fairness technique, especially for addressing subgroup imbalances through balanced synthetic datasets.\nOverall, privacy-enhanced synthetic data generation, coupled with fairness-aware strategies, is crucial for secure and ethical data sharing that meets both privacy and fairness standards in research and industry applications."}, {"title": "Evaluation", "content": "Evaluating the quality of synthetic data is essential to validate its effectiveness and applicability in practical applications. Key strategies include human evaluation, which relies on expert assessments to judge data quality but is often resource-intensive and may not scale well for high-dimensional datasets. Statistical evaluation offers a quantitative approach by comparing real and synthetic datasets across various metrics, allowing for objective assessments of data fidelity. Additionally, pre-trained machine learning models can serve as discriminators, assessing how closely synthetic data approximates real data, a common technique in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [Jordon et al., 2018]. The \"Train on Synthetic, Test on Real\u201d (TSTR) approach evaluates synthetic data by training models on it and measuring performance on real data, thus gauging its utility for downstream tasks. Lastly, application-specific evaluations consider unique domain requirements, such as regulatory compliance and usability, to ensure synthesized data meets specific standards. By combining these methods, researchers can achieve a comprehensive understanding of synthetic data's strengths and limitations, which is pivotal for advancing generation techniques and expanding their applications across fields."}, {"title": "Human-Based Evaluation", "content": "Human evaluation Feng et al. [2024] is a fundamental, though often challenging, method to assess the quality of synthetic data. This approach involves gathering feedback from domain experts or general users to judge the data's realism, usability, and similarity to actual data within specific applications. Human evaluation plays a particularly crucial role in tasks where subjective interpretation is essential, such as speech synthesis [Donahue et al., 2019], where evaluators rate the perceived naturalness and clarity of synthesized voices compared to real human speech in a blind, side-by-side manner [Bengio et al., 2000]. This method allows evaluators to provide insights into subtle nuances that automated metrics might overlook, such as intonation, articulation, and fluidity, which are vital for creating high-quality, user-friendly synthetic voices. Similarly, in computer vision, human judges may assess the accuracy and realism of synthetic images, examining details like texture, lighting, and object consistency, which can be critical for applications in virtual reality and gaming.\nDespite its advantages, human evaluation has notable limitations. It is resource-intensive, requiring both time and financial investment to gather and analyze opinions from experts or a broad range of users. This method is also subject to variability and potential bias, as human judgments can differ due to individual perceptions, experiences, and interpretation of quality standards. Scalability becomes another hurdle, as this process does not easily extend to evaluating large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as complex image or video datasets, which cannot be fully examined by a human evaluator due to time constraints. High-dimensional synthetic data often contains intricate patterns or attributes that are challenging to assess through visual inspection alone. Moreover, for areas like medical image synthesis or genomic data, human evaluators may lack the ability to validate highly technical details, further limiting the utility of this approach. As a result, while human evaluation provides valuable qualitative insights, it is often best complemented with objective, automated evaluation techniques to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality and applicability."}, {"title": "Statistical-Based Evaluation", "content": "Statistical difference evaluation is a widely-used strategy to quantitatively assess the quality of synthetic data by comparing statistical metrics between synthetic and real datasets. This approach involves calculating key statistics, such as mean, variance, and correlation, for individual features within both datasets. The closer these statistical properties are, the better the quality and fidelity of the synthetic data. For instance, in electronic health record (EHR) data generation, metrics like the frequency and correlation of medical concepts, as well as patient-level clinical features, are examined to ensure that synthetic data closely mirrors real-world patterns [Bengio et al., 2000]. Smaller statistical differences suggest that the synthetic data has successfully captured the underlying distribution of the real data, making it a valuable proxy for various downstream applications.\nAdvanced techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be utilized to enhance statistical difference evaluation. By training SVMs on synthetic and real datasets, researchers can examine how well the models separate or align these two datasets. In cases where the SVM achieves a high accuracy in differentiating between real and synthetic data, it may indicate notable differences in their distributions. Conversely, if the model struggles to separate them, it suggests that the synthetic data closely approximates the real data distribution. These methods offer a robust, objective means to evaluate similarity, allowing researchers to refine synthetic data generation techniques to achieve better quality and utility across various applications."}, {"title": "Using Pretrained Models", "content": "Using a pre-trained machine learning model to evaluate synthetic data quality provides an automated, robust method for assessing how well the synthetic data approximates real data. In the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Goodfellow et al. [2014], this approach leverages the discriminator, a model trained to distinguish between real and synthetic (fake) data, as a quality measure. As the generator improves, it learns to produce data that increasingly \"fools\" the discriminator, making it difficult for the discriminator to differentiate synthetic data from real data. The discriminator's accuracy or confidence level when evaluating the synthetic data thus serves as an indicator of the generator's success in producing realistic data. A low performance of the discriminator suggests that the synthetic data closely resembles the real data, signifying a high-quality output.\nThis evaluation strategy is not limited to GANs. Pre-trained machine learning models, such as image classifiers or language models, can also serve this purpose across various types of synthetic data. For example, in synthetic image generation, a pre-trained image classifier can be used to evaluate the synthetic images by measuring how well it classifies them compared to real images. Similarly, for text data, a language model's perplexity on synthetic data relative to real data can provide insights into quality. The strength of this approach lies in its ability to provide automated, task-specific feedback on the realism of synthetic data, making it a versatile evaluation tool across different generative models and domains.

High performance on real test data implies that the synthetic data effectively captures the essential characteristics and patterns of the real data, making it a viable substitute for training purposes. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where access to real data is restricted due to privacy or availability concerns, as it enables researchers to assess whether models trained on synthetic data can generalize well to real-world conditions.\nFor example, in [Esteban et al., 2017], synthetic data is used to train machine learning models, and their prediction performance is then evaluated on real test data in healthcare applications. This method provides valuable insights into the generalizability of models trained on synthetic datasets, as high TSTR performance across diverse applications\u2014such as classification, regression, or segmentation tasks\u2014indicates that the synthetic data can serve as an effective proxy. Additionally, TSTR enables developers to identify specific aspects where synthetic data may fall short, guiding further improvements in data generation methods to enhance real-world applicability.

One significant avenue is the capability to generate larger and more diverse datasets.

Investigating new generative models or enhancing existing ones could improve the quality and diversity of synthetic data. Importantly, demonstrating that these advancements can be achieved using accessible computational resources, such as a personal computer with a well-coded pipeline, would underscore the feasibility of cutting-edge AI developments without the need for extensive infrastructure. This democratization of technology could encourage broader participation in the field and accelerate innovation.\nAdditionally, integrating more robust privacy-preserving techniques into the data generation process remains a critical area for future work. As privacy concerns continue to grow, developing methods that ensure data utility while rigorously protecting sensitive information is essential. Combining differential privacy mechanisms with generative models could provide stronger guarantees and expand the adoption of synthetic data in sensitive domains.\nFinally, applying synthetic data generation techniques to a wider range of applications, including those with complex data types such as time-series, graphs, and multimodal data, would significantly broaden the impact of this research.

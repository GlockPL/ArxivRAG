{"title": "Exploring Al-Enabled Cybersecurity Frameworks: Deep-Learning Techniques, GPU Support, and Future Enhancements", "authors": ["TOBIAS BECHER", "SIMON TORKA"], "abstract": "Traditional rule-based cybersecurity systems have proven highly effective against known malware threats. However, they face challenges in detecting novel threats. To address this issue, emerging cybersecurity systems are incorporating AI techniques, specifically deep-learning algorithms, to enhance their ability to detect incidents, analyze alerts, and respond to events. While these techniques offer a promising approach to combating dynamic security threats, they often require significant computational resources. Therefore, frameworks that incorporate AI-based cybersecurity mechanisms need to support the use of GPUs to ensure optimal performance. Many cybersecurity framework vendors do not provide sufficiently detailed information about their implementation, making it difficult to assess the techniques employed and their effectiveness. This study aims to overcome this limitation by providing an overview of the most used cybersecurity frameworks that utilize AI techniques, specifically focusing on frameworks that provide comprehensive information about their implementation. Our primary objective is to identify the deep-learning techniques employed by these frameworks and evaluate their support for GPU acceleration. We have identified a total of two deep-learning algorithms that are utilized by three out of 38 selected cybersecurity frameworks. Our findings aim to assist in selecting open-source cybersecurity frameworks for future research and assessing any discrepancies between deep-learning techniques used in theory and practice.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "As cybersecurity threats become more prevalent [6], cybersecurity tools must retain the ability to keep systems safe. Traditionally, cyber threats have been combated using a rules-based approach that involves investigating detected incidents, classifying attack vectors, and defining a custom solution to mitigate the threat. For example, part of the initial strategy to stop one of the first computer worms, the Morris Worm, was to put simple rules in place. In this case, disabling the FINGER-Daemon that the worm relied on eliminated one of the three ways it could infect a system [26]. Over time, threats have become increasingly complex, and of course, security solutions must adapt [4]. Cybersecurity vendors now offer a myriad of different tools and platforms to handle security, privacy, and safety concerns. By examining the market's key players, as we describe in Section 3.1, it is possible to uncover any potential gap between theory and practice, especially in their use of novel techniques. However, assessing the technical details of cybersecurity products can be a challenging task. Publicly available documentation is often insufficient, making it difficult to conduct a thorough evaluation. In the materials we reviewed to evaluate cybersecurity products from the major vendors in the marketplace, we encountered several instances where a lack of detail made it difficult to determine the underlying technical specifications of a product. For example, the product materials for Fortinet\u00b9 and SentinelOne\u00b2, two multinational cybersecurity companies that are significant vendors in the market, do not provide enough detail for a thorough review. Fortinet offers products categorized as network, application, and endpoint security, among others. However, it is not immediately clear how these solutions operate internally, as Fortinet does not provide implementation details to the public [20]. The publicly available resources for the AI-powered security tool Singularity, offered by SentinelOne, include references to a mix of a rules-based and an AI-powered approach [59]. Since most cybersecurity frameworks are closed-source, private software solutions, it is difficult to gain more detailed insight into their inner workings."}, {"title": "STATE OF THE ART", "content": "To discuss the current state of the art, we divide the related research into two parts. The first part, Cybersecurity Systems, addresses current implementations of various cybersecurity tools, such as antivirus suites, as well as proposed implementations from research. In the second part, we review research that provides an overview of current deep- learning techniques in cybersecurity. As far as we are aware, there is no recent work that addresses GPU support for AI-based cybersecurity tools. Concerning our study, the first part gives us an overview of market solutions but does not explicitly examine the (deep-learning) techniques used among them. Often, the tools are discussed in a market context and less from a technical point of view. Compared to the papers in Part Two, which presented deep-learning techniques, we focus on the implementation of these techniques in current cybersecurity software and how well these frameworks can execute them effectively and efficiently.\nCybersecurity Systems. In 2020, Tselios et al. conducted a technical survey investigating the cybersecurity market. They categorized existing cybersecurity solutions into 13 categories, such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Endpoint Detection and Response, or Identity and Access Management. They concluded that the current cybersecurity market does not offer a product that is capable of holistically covering all capabilities to be effective in all security categories, but that every framework must adopt the latest innovations [74]. A study by Gonz\u00e1lez-Granadillo et al. focused on the analysis of the SIEM market. They compiled a list of current commercial solutions and classified them according to their functionality and market position. Especially noteworthy are their remarks on the use of machine learning in these SIEMs. They state that, while machine learning approaches should be used more often, only a few current software solutions include them [23].\nOverview of Deep-Learning Techniques in Cybersecurity. The work of Berman et al. gives a thorough overview of deep-learning techniques in cybersecurity research through January 2019. They describe the techniques and collect usage statistics in the surveyed work. They see the limitations of the field primarily in the lack of quality datasets for training and evaluation, and the fact that these techniques are only used in isolation, i.e., they do not consider the entire attack lifecycle [4]. Other studies have listed various deep-learning algorithms for cybersecurity [57, 32, 31, 16, 79], either adding works that are not included in the survey by Berman et al. or discussing other aspects, such as adversarial learning [32]. For example, Dixit and Silakari added the category of reinforcement learning algorithms and their use in cybersecurity, while also extending the included research to papers published before May 2020 [16]. Taken together, there is a wide range of deep learning techniques being applied to cybersecurity problems."}, {"title": "BACKGROUND", "content": "Before discussing cybersecurity frameworks, we want to clarify the most important terms used in this paper, our methodology, and finally give a short overview of GPU support in AI-based software."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Since this work reviews various cybersecurity frameworks, it is important to discuss the selection method of software solutions. According to Haleliuk [24], IT-Harvest Dashboard, the largest cybersecurity vendor database, counts more than 3,200 companies in the cybersecurity market. The market, while containing several key players, is not dominated by one company [66]. Therefore, we want to provide our methodology for selecting a representative sample for our survey. We reviewed the products of the key players in the market and any vendors listed in the categories Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, Endpoint Detection and Response, and Identity and Access Management in the survey by Tselios et al. [74]. Additionally, we conducted a Google and Google Scholar search using combinations of the term \"cybersecurity framework\" and one of the terms \u201csolution\u201d, \u201cplatform\u201d, \u201cIDS\u201d, \u201cSIEM\u201d, and \u201cSOAR\u201d and their unabbreviated versions. We limited our results to the first three pages of the Google search results and the first page of the Google Scholar results. We selected all results that demonstrated the potential to fit our definition of cybersecurity frameworks, as defined in Section 3.2. Products that did not provide cybersecurity solutions in the aforementioned fields were discarded. Research works that did not provide implementations were discarded as well. Combining the results from our search with the list of vendors from the survey and market statistics, we arrived at a list of 38 vendors and no research works. The lack of research is not necessarily surprising, as cybersecurity frameworks, such as those described in a study by Luh et al. [35], do not meet our criteria for cybersecurity frameworks, primarily because of their lack of extensibility. The selected vendors' websites were searched for product information, such as white papers and technical doc- umentation, and reviewed for machine- and deep-learning features. It is important to be aware of the fact that the analysis presented here is based on information that may not have been specifically crafted for a scientific or technically proficient audience. As a result, there is a possibility that the reviewed materials, including marketing materials, may not accurately convey all of the technical aspects of the product, potentially resulting in different interpretations and decreased reliability. However, given the lack of other research on the topic, we find this to be the best available method for analyzing these products."}, {"title": "Terminology", "content": "First, we want to disambiguate the term cybersecurity framework from related vocabulary. Then, we give brief definitions for the three categories of cybersecurity systems. In this study, we use the terms cybersecurity framework and cybersecurity platform interchangeably to describe an extensible software framework that is tasked with achieving one or more of the cybersecurity goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Our definition is not to be confused with the commonly accepted meaning of the term in the context of organizational security. There, cybersecurity frameworks are often also referred to as cybersecurity risk management frameworks, as e.g., examined by Taherdoost [69], and represent a distinct area of study and practice.\nDefinition 3.1. A cybersecurity framework refers to a software system designed to manage and safeguard digital assets from potential threats and attacks. It serves as a foundational architecture that incorporates various cybersecurity tools. Therefore, it can contain capabilities of more specific cybersecurity tools of categories such as Endpoint Detection"}, {"title": "GPU Support for Machine-Learning Algorithms", "content": "Typically, deep-learning algorithms require GPUs to compute efficiently, with GPUs achieving up to a 10-times acceleration of training time and/or inference [3]. Popular deep-learning frameworks, like TensorFlow\u00b3 and PyTorch\u2074 provide native GPU support. While popular Machine Learning (ML) frameworks, such as Scikit-learn\u2075, do not always provide GPU support, this can often be mitigated by third-party libraries. A prominent example is the RAPIDS\u2076 ecosystem by NVIDIA, which provides libraries for executing data science code on GPUs while keeping the same API. For example, to use an ML algorithm included in the Scikit-learn library with GPU acceleration, cuML\u2077 can be used. According to research from 2022, the RAPIDS algorithms are currently not performing as well as their Scikit-learn counterparts when used with default settings but can still provide satisfactory results when the hyperparameters are tuned accordingly [41]."}, {"title": "Challenges of Deep Learning in Cybersecurity", "content": "The challenges for applying deep learning are similar across computer science domains and contain aspects such as the quality of input data, data representation in feature space, training time, inference performance, and more. Focusing on aspects that are relevant to the use of deep-learning algorithms in cybersecurity frameworks, we briefly discuss the distinctions these challenges have in cybersecurity over other disciplines.\nDatasets. Quality data are a pillar of effective machine learning in every domain. To obtain training data for a cybersecurity machine-learning approach, researchers are presented with a choice: collect the data from real computer systems and/or networks, synthesize a dataset, or use an existing public dataset. Unfortunately, all of these options come with significant challenges, and obtaining enough quality data remains one of the major concerns in cybersecurity research that makes use of machine learning. First, collecting real data requires permission from a sufficiently large institution to monitor their activities. This often entails various concerns, such as privacy concerns or concerns over interference with normal operations. This approach is only feasible for projects that require only a very limited scope of data, such as monitoring the network traffic of one device in an isolated network. This way, concerns can be handled on an individual basis."}, {"title": "Cybersecurity Frameworks", "content": "We reviewed publicly available information on cybersecurity products from 38 different vendors and one research paper and grouped them into six categories"}, {"title": "Cybersecurity Frameworks Using Deep Learning", "content": "To assess the state of deep learning in cybersecurity frameworks, we examine the three frameworks we identified for using deep learning: NVIDIA Morpheus, Vectra AI, and Check Point's R81. Following a brief introduction in this section, we look at the techniques these frameworks employ in Section 4.2.\nNVIDIA Morpheus. NVIDIA Morpheus [46] is an open-source cybersecurity framework that utilizes various machine- learning and deep-learning methods to enhance cybersecurity. It enables developers to create optimized Al pipelines for real-time data processing, classification, and threat detection. Morpheus integrates various tools, including pre-trained Al capabilities and telemetry analysis, to facilitate quick development and deployment of cybersecurity solutions. They claim, that with real-time telemetry and GPU acceleration, Morpheus can efficiently capture and act upon threats that were previously undetectable, providing valuable insights for immediate response. Morpheus makes use of the RAPIDS libraries for preprocessing, as discussed in Section 3.3."}, {"title": "Employed Deep-Learning Techniques", "content": "After carefully reviewing the documentation and product description, we have identified a total of two deep-learning algorithms that are utilized by the three cybersecurity frameworks. For instance, for NVIDIA Morpheus' digital fingerprinting task, an Autoencoder algorithm is employed. Similarly, Vectra makes use of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model to efficiently detect C2 channels. All other techniques used by the frameworks are either not further disclosed, e.g., deep-learning approaches by the Checkpoint Quantum Cyber Security Platform R81, or are considered ML techniques, e.g., Vectra's use of Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN), which is a hierarchical clustering algorithm [7]."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION & OUTLOOK", "content": "In conclusion, our research on cybersecurity software frameworks reveals several key findings and insights. Firstly, we have observed that only a limited subset of cybersecurity solutions provides public information or technical details, which hinders transparency and collaboration in the field. This lack of openness restricts the broader community from fully understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of these solutions. Furthermore, our investigation indicates that Deep Learning (DL) is not widely adopted in existing cybersecurity frameworks, and neither is GPU support. While there are promising ideas and research focusing on the utilization of DL techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [30, 51], and Deep Neural Networks [80], their practical implementation and real-world viability remain uncertain. Deep-learning methods, although exhibiting potential, have not yet been proven ready for deployment in real-life environments due to underlying challenges, such as the availability of quality cybersecurity datasets or training and inference speed. Extensive testing and evaluation are necessary to determine if methods presented in research [4] have efficacy and advantages over traditional methods. Looking ahead, future work in DL methods for use in cybersecurity frameworks should consider focusing on addressing foundational problems within specific areas of cybersecurity, such as Intrusion Detection. For example, by providing better datasets for the training of ML algorithms, it becomes possible to compare new approaches and train deeper models effectively. While DL holds promise for enhancing cybersecurity, further research is needed to refine and adapt these techniques to address the unique challenges of the field. While overcoming issues such as interpretability, model explainability, and adversarial attacks is crucial to demonstrating the readiness of deep learning for deployment in real-life environments, researchers should also consider evaluating the operational viability of their approach."}]}

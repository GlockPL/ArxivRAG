The primary challenge in this field is the effective separation and recognition of speech from background noise, crucial for applications ranging from voice-activated assistants to automated transcription services. The quality of speech recognition directly impacts user experience and accessibility in technology-driven communication. This review paper explores advanced clustering techniques, particularly focusing on the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) method, to address these challenges. Our findings indicate that KFCM, compared to traditional methods like K-Means (KM) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), provides superior performance in handling non-linear and non-stationary noise conditions in speech signals. The most notable outcome of this review is the adaptability of KFCM to various noisy environments, making it a robust choice for speech enhancement applications. Additionally, the paper identifies gaps in current methodologies, such as the need for more dynamic clustering algorithms that can adapt in real time to changing noise conditions without compromising speech recognition quality. Key contributions include a detailed comparative analysis of current clustering algorithms and suggestions for further integrating hybrid models that combine KFCM with neural networks to enhance speech recognition accuracy. Through this review, we advocate for a shift towards more sophisticated, adaptive clustering techniques that can significantly improve speech enhancement and pave the way for more resilient speech processing systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Clustering is an unsupervised machine-learning technique that groups data points based on their similarities. In this method, both real objects (like a number gathered by a sensor) or non-real objects (e.g., a document) can be used. Some of the most used clustering techniques are K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means and Kernel Fuzzy C-Means out of which diversified usages can be identified in fields such as data mining, pattern recognition etc. (Zhang and Zhao, 2024). Although K-Means is more popular due to its simplicity and quick performance in many applications, FCM has the measures of membership degrees which provide more flexibility and accuracy necessary while dealing with datasets having overlapping clusters. It is an extension of FCM with added kernel methods to manage non-separable incidences; to excel it is widely applied in various complicated subject fields comprises of speech signal processing than KFCM (Vani et al., 2019). Thus, the uses of these clustering techniques are diverse, including data analysis, applications in biological data analysis or biotechnology, machine learning, image processing and others. That is why, due to the nonlinearity and non-stationary nature of the speech data, the methods mentioned above are appropriate, as they act rather correctly managing uncertainty and providing not only binary results, but rather spectrum of the memberships, that can improve the performance of the model in comparison with the basic techniques (Singh and Singh., 2024). In the present review, we compare KM, FCM, and KFCM and presented the importance of these methods for analysis and improvement of speech signals. Unlike previous works, this review takes some features into account such as, Euclidean distance algorithmic complexity, blurring effects, stopping criteria, execution times and recognition precision (Kumar et al., 2020). The study aims at determining the applicability of these techniques in addressing noisy additive and speech signals using different types of datasets which are homogeneous and heterogeneous. The article especially highlights the advantage of Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) clause in handling aggregated and noisy signals, as highlighted by Aradnia et al. (2022). This comprehensive review is called for by publication trends indicating the annual output and interest in these clustering techniques especially FCM and KFCM is rising steadily. An analysis of major academic databases reveals a significant annual increase in publications related to these methods, indicating a sustained interest and ongoing advancements in their applications (Source: Name of Database, Library Journal Database Analysis, 2024). The main purpose of this review is to provide the academic community with novel information's on the methodological developments and various applications of KM, FCM, and KFCM. It aims at filling existing gaps by presenting recent findings and discussing the newest areas of applications in modern fields including image processing, agriculture, data mining, and others (Czarnowski and J\u0119drzejowicz, 2018; Khanlari and Ehsanian, 2017). This work not only helps researchers to improve their research in speech signal processing but also encourages them to explore new directions further in respect of new application areas and improvements on these methodologies in other areas where uncertainty and"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "Speech signal processing has become of significant significance for the contemporary need of digital communication covering the areas of telecommunication, automated transcription, and voice activated systems (Abdullah et al., 2024). The main difficulty is speech recognition from noisy background which is crucial in enhancing the quality of communication and the effectiveness of speech-based systems (Abdullah et al.,2024). The process of speech signal processing contains several steps, which are summarized in figure 3:\n\u2022 Data Input: The first stream of data is in the form of speech information of a given session.\n\u2022 Preprocessing: The data is first preprocessed to reduce noise and to normalize the data.\n\u2022 Feature Extraction: The preprocessed data is used to derive the features that are naturally grouped in clusters.\n\u2022 Clustering: Various methods of clustering (K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, and K-Partitional Fuzzy \u0421-Means) are used to cluster the data points.\n\u2022 Clustered Output: These clusters can then be used for further processing or even for analysis.\nEach is important in Preprocessing and Postprocessing the speech to ensure that good quality information is passed in the communication and to ensure reliability in noisy environment. The techniques discussed, that includes K-Means, FCM, and KFCM, are different ways of parting data into clusters where the fuzzy clustering methods FCM and KFCM, include more complex features for handling uncertainty to enhance clustering (Salman and Alomary., 2024)."}, {"title": "2.1 Clustering Techniques", "content": "Clustering is used to identify close relationships between data. In the other hand, fuzzy logic can identify to which degree, each data belongs to their respective groups. Therefore, clustering methods are divided into two categories: soft-clustering and hard-clustering (Hosseini et al.,2024). soft clustering uses the concept of fuzzy membership functions such as triangular or Gaussian to group the data so that each point of data becomes a member of two or more groups with different membership values (Lin and Busso., 2024). Hard clustering, on the other hand, assigns each data point to exactly one cluster, without any ambiguity about its membership. In the literature, there are a large number of clustering algorithms. However, this study focuses on Fuzzy C-Means, K-Means, and Kernel Fuzzy C-Means Methods merely (Liu et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "2.1.1 K-Means Clustering Technique", "content": "K-means clustering is one of the most fundamental and widely used clustering algorithms due to its simplicity and efficiency. It is designed to partition a dataset into distinct clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance. The algorithm starts with an initial set of centroids, which can be selected randomly or through heuristic methods such as the K-Means algorithm that improves initialization (Ahmed and Hassan, 2023). During each iteration, K-Means assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, forming clusters based on Euclidean distance. In so doing, centroids are redefined as the average of all the data points that are assigned to specific clusters after the assignment process. This process happens iteratively until the convergence, which is distinguished by the small change in the centroid's location or the change in the cluster's assignment.\nFigure 4 A. illustrates the step-by-step process of the K-Means algorithm:\nInitialization: Randomly choose k initial centroids or by some heuristic method.\nAssignment: The next step consists in labelling each data point with the centroid which is nearest to it according to the Euclidean distance.\nUpdate: About the centroid update rule, new centroids are determined as the average coordinate of all data points belonging to a particular cluster.\nConvergence Check: Perform the assignment and update steps again and again until the current and the new centroids are almost same.\nK-Means is a popular algorithm; however, it has some drawbacks. It becomes a factor of the number of clusters k which must be determined by the user in advance, in case the right one is unknown. Thus, it can be noted that the algorithm is very dependent on the initial positioning of the centroids, and this is likely to result into different clusters on different uses of the same data set. In addition, it makes certain assumptions like spherical clusters and equal cluster size which might not be very useful for dataset having clusters of varying shapes and densities (Abdullah and Veisi., 2022). Therefore, there are several important implications of K-Means; though it is one of the efficient algorithms particularly when dealing with big data and generally gives good solutions, it has some restrictions on the type of data it is fitting for, and the parameters of the algorithm must be chosen accurately."}, {"title": "2.1.2 FCM Clustering Technique:", "content": "Compared with the category III, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is more flexible where every single data point can belong to multiple clusters at the same time with some levels of membership. This method is especially used when the data points cannot be easily classified or when there is blurring between clusters. FCM works by Endowing each data point with membership values, which describe how much the data point belongs to each cluster. These membership values are then used to compute the cluster centers as weighted means of the data points where the weight is the respective membership value (Yu et al., 2024).\nFigure 4 B. depicts the process of FCM:\n1. Initialization: Assign the first memberships and the initial positions of the cluster centers.\n2. Update Membership: Assign fuzzy membership values for each data point about their distances to the cluster centers and on the fuzziness parameter mmm.\n3. Update Centers: Find new cluster centers by averaging the new membership values concerning all data points belonging to each cluster.\n4. Convergence Check: Perform the update steps until convergence, that is, the membership values and the cluster centers do not change significantly.\nFCM has been proved to be a useful tool for most of the applications due to its flexibility to allow overlapping of clusters such as image segmentation where the pixels fall under more than one region and with different intensity levels. Soft partitioning appears to give more about the structure of the data and the membership values offer more fine-grained segmentation patterns (Dhal et al., 2024). However, FCM is dependent on the parameters for example the fuzziness parameter which was represented as mmm determines the degree of overlapping between the clusters. Thirdly, there is a limitation of being computationally costly for large set because the membership matrix is gradually modified through iteration. However, FCM is still a valuable technique for clustering data that by their nature contain uncertainty and are blurred between clusters (Moosavi et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "2.1.3 KFCM Clustering Technique", "content": "KFCM is an improved method of FCM because it takes advantage of the kernel methods, which makes it easier to solve problems of data that cannot be well classified and clustered using the traditional methods. The idea of KFCM is that kernel functions should spread the points into a higher dimensional space where there may be much better cluster separation. This is a management transformation that allows KFCM to preserve detailed structures of data that cannot be easily separated in the original space (Singh and Srivastava., 2024).\nFigure 4 C. illustrates the steps involved in KFCM:\n1. Kernel Mapping: Use kernel function to map the lower or higher original data into a higher-dimensional feature space.\n2. Initialization: Assign the first value to the members and centers of the clusters in the transformed space.\n3. Update Membership: Assign the weights of membership to the level of the distances in the feature space of data points from the centers of different clusters.\n4. Update Centers: Update new importance values of clusters as the average of data points weighted based on membership values.\n5. Convergence Check: Perform the update steps until the membership values, and the cluster centers patterns, are stabilized.\nDue to kernel methods, KFCM can capture complex dependencies and structures of data in a direct way, which is essential for datasets with a high degree of complexity. They often use it in fields like pattern analysis and in the biomedical field due to the high level of complexity. Nonetheless, the selection of the kernel function and its parameters substantively affects the convergence of KFCM, and the time complexity raises with a high value of the feature space. These challenges can nevertheless be explained by the fact that KFCM offers a strong substrate for confronting complicated clustering issues and improving clustering quality in severe conditions (Shang et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "2.3 Role of Clustering Techniques in Speech Enhancement and Noise Reduction", "content": "Speech processing incorporates a broad set of approaches related to the analysis, generation and modification of speech. These techniques are applied in many areas such as in speech recognition, speaker recognition and speech, options (Batra et al., 2024). Speech recognition is a process of transforming spoken language to text, in real application such as voice operated devices and transcription (Abdullah et al., 2024). The applications of speaker identification and verification are based on the voice pattern to assert or recognize identity for security and services needed (Muhamad et al., 2024). Another important field within speech processing is the one of speech enhancement, which constitutes improving the quality and acoustical clarity of the speech signal, by reducing the input of different kinds of distortions such as the background noise (Mraihi and Ben Messaoud., 2024). A speech enhancement system is essential in many environments, for example, mobile communication, as well as hearing aids where clear speech is important (Patil and Pandhare., 2025). This may incorporate use of complex mathematical models meant to filter the signals of speech from the rest of the noise to ensure the final speech is still intelligible (Upadhyay., 2024). Other applications of SP are speech synthesis where computer generated voices are used to convert written text into voice (Ahmad and Rashid., 2024). This technology is used in assistive devices and virtual agents and automated customer care, where natural sounding and contextually suitable speech is required (Huq et al., 2024). Linguistic and acoustic characteristics of ASR and speech synthesis algorithms should be complemented to achieve high quality synthetic speech (Tan et al., 2024). Clustering is an important technique when it comes to noise reduction within the FP realm since data that form a cluster are grouped together in order to separate speech from noise. Noise reduction in clustering algorithms seeks to differentiate between speech and the different types of noises that can be applied different procedures (Xu and Wunsch, 2023). Due to efficient data sorting in terms of an audio feature collection, these algorithms can enhance the quality of speech, focusing on noise components removal without losing the values of speech quality (Lee et al., 2024). A simple yet effective method for noise reduction employs K-Means clustering for the proper categorization and identification of audio makers into disparate clusters that define the speech and noise characteristics (Saha et al., 2024). This method is appreciated from the computational point of view and its simplicity; for this reason, it applies to situations where speech and noise are sufficiently separated (Wang and Watanabe., 2024).

This limitation is due to its reliance on Euclidean distance, which does not effectively capture the variability in complex noise patterns. FCM improves on this by allowing partial membership in multiple clusters, thereby providing better noise robustness. This flexibility enables FCM to perform better than K-Means in a condition that has dynamic noise level. However, is superior to both by utilizing kernel functions to address non-linear noise in far superior ways. The kernel transformation moves the data into a higher dimension where separability is easily done and makes KFCM more immune to noise. This robustness proves rather beneficial in practical scenarios where noise regimes can be volatile and have high variability (Zhang et al., 2021; Xu and Wunsch, 2023)."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Computational Cost", "content": "Since K-Means is relatively fast, this method is preferred especially when it must deal with many objects and/or it necessarily needs to be fast. Due to its easy to implement and quickly converging nature, it is preferable for the situations when there are the constraints in terms of computational power. However, FCM, even with superior noise handling capability, is computationally expensive mainly because of the need to constantly update the membership iteratively and the fuzzy membership values computations. This"}, {"title": "4.2.3 Data Ambiguity", "content": "Assigned clusters are evident, non-overlapping as it results in the computation of K-Means, it may not be effective in analyzing fuzzy data information that is ambushed by multiple clusters. They are capable of misclassification in those cases which involve overlapping or gradual transitions between different clusters. FCM does it by allowing the data sample to be a member of more than cluster, and with different level of membership. Due to its capability in handling the ambiguity FCM, this approach offers a more refined clustering solution to the problem. KFCM improves this ability more by including kernel methods that help to address issues of overlapping as well as uncertain data patterns. The kernel transformation significantly enables KFCM to develop more precise clusters in higher dimensions, which reveals the subtlety of data better than K-Means or FCM (Dunn and Zadeh, 2019; Bezdek et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "4.2.4 Non-linear Data", "content": "In fact, K-Means has been seen weak in managing non-linear data since the distance measure used in the algorithm is a measure of Euclidean distance in the linear feature space. This makes it less attractive in comprehensively interpreting the physical phenomena characterized by non-linear interactive data characteristics typical of most speech signal processing. FCM doesn't significantly better in this regard, but it also fails with highly non-linear data. The fuzzy membership values do assist a little in this instance, but they are still riddled with linear constraints. KFCM is particularly skilled in handling non-linear data through a set of kernels which bring the data into a higher dimension. This transform improves the separability in linear plane making the KFCM appropriate in non-linear speech signal analysis. The versatility in handling non-linearities provides more efficient means of clustering difficult data environments due to the high accuracy provided by KFCM (Srinivasan, & Gupta, 2024)."}, {"title": "4.2.5 Real-time Adaptation", "content": "Real-time changes during clustering are very important in dynamic environments to provide accuracy of clustering. K-Means, with its fixed centroids, does not perform so well in dynamic environments. However, what counts against K-Means is the fact that it is a static algorithm that means it can rarely work in environments where characteristics of the data under analysis can rapidly change. While FCM requires point specific membership values and is not as good at providing adaptations within iterations it is evident that the fuzzy membership values present more flexibility based on the arrival of data points. Still, the most robust performance is seen with KFCM, during real time dynamics of noise by virtue of its kernel-based structure. Since KFCM guarantees high clustering accuracy in the growing noise environment, its applicability to real-time speech processing is essential as the conditions constantly change (Lee et al., 2023; Gupta and Kumar, 2024)."}, {"title": "4 Results and discussion:", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Advancements in Clustering Techniques for Noise Detection in Speech Signal Processing", "content": "New emerging techniques in clustering have enhanced noise identification and the speech signal processing for potential uses in telecommunications among other fields. These strategies have been used in filtering out noises from the useful speech components and therefore improvement on their sound outputs.\nExpectation Distance-based Distributional Clustering (EDC): This method considers the signs between distributions increasing its noise tolerance. EDC operates in a way that makes it identify noise differently from other clustering techniques that operate with marginal distributions only. This approach has shown success and applicability in multiple domains for instance, in a situation where speech signals must be processed and where usually, it is very hard to differentiate between actual noise and actual speech signals (Abdel-Kader, El-Sayad, and Rizk, 2021).\nHybrid Clustering Model with K-means and Classification Filtering: This approach combines the K-means clustering with classification filtering to efficient identification of noise in the data. First, we use the K-means clustering algorithms to extract all clusters and categorize instances that are far different from cluster centroids as noise. Classification filtering is also used after that to enhance the noise identification to filter out noise accurately. Consequently, this model has provided the means for enhancing quality of data in one or more datasets (Nematzadeh, Ibrahim, and Selamat, 2020).\nFuzzy C-Means and Ensemble Filtering: FCM when used with ensemble filtering methods improves the ability to identify class noise. Since FCM can assign membership level to data point, then it comes in handy when faced with overlapping and noisy clusters. The final subcomponent is the ensemble filtering which brings greater accuracy to noise identification as well as guarantees that noise of high importance is adequately filtered out at the end of the process (Thudumu et al., 2020).\nLocal Outlier Factor (LOF) for Noise Detection: The LOF method recognizes certain values as noise and identifies them as coming from an unusual distribution in data. With the help of using, it combined with other conventional clustering algorithms such as K-means, LOF successfully filter out several noisy data points especially when the environment entails high fluctuation. This has been used in the speech signal where much of the background noise is eliminated and an enhancement on the speech signal is achieved (Subha and Sathiaseelan, 2023).\nAll these advanced clustering techniques jointly enhance the noise detection and speech signal enhancement. These methods improve overall qualities of audio data, which makes them indispensable in modern audio processing and telecommunication systems by providing adequate identification and filtering of noise. This is, however, an area that has had constant research and development towards the betterment and herein lies the prospect to more reliable noise detection solutions."}, {"title": "4.2.

Conclusion", "content": "In this review study, a comprehensive comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of recognizing homogeneous and heterogeneous speech data under clear and noisy conditions using clustering algorithms: K-Means, FCM, and KFCM. Our findings indicate that the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) clustering technique consistently outperforms K-Means and FCM across various metrics, demonstrating superior performance in all evaluated scenarios. The primary objective of speech enhancement is to improve the clarity and comprehensibility of speech signals, especially in noisy environments. KFCM has shown remarkable proficiency in this regard, leveraging its advanced kernel functions to effectively separate speech from complex, non-linear noise. This capability is critical for applications such as voice-activated assistants, automated transcription services, and telecommunication systems, where clear and accurate speech recognition is paramount. Despite the advancements presented by KFCM, there are still gaps in current methodologies that need addressing. The computational efficiency of KFCM can be a limiting factor, particularly for real-time applications. Future research should focus on optimizing the algorithm to reduce its computational load without compromising performance. Additionally, integrating KFCM with neural networks could further enhance its accuracy and adaptability, paving the way for more sophisticated speech processing systems. This survey makes several key contributions to the field of speech signal processing. Firstly, it provides a detailed comparative analysis of K-Means, FCM, and KFCM, offering valuable insights into their performance across different noise conditions. Secondly, it highlights the superior capabilities of KFCM in handling non-linear and non-stationary noise, establishing it as the most robust technique among the three. Thirdly, the review identifies critical gaps in current methodologies and suggests potential areas for future research, including the integration of hybrid models and the development of more dynamic clustering algorithms. Through this review, we advocate for a shift towards more sophisticated, adaptive clustering techniques that can significantly improve speech enhancement and recognition. By addressing the limitations of traditional methods and leveraging the advanced capabilities of KFCM, this study sets a new benchmark for noise robustness and adaptability in speech signal processing. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to consider KFCM and its hybrid variants to achieve superior performance in their applications, ultimately enhancing user experience and accessibility in technology-driven communication."}]}

In building a database of\nbinary forms we can follow two main methods.\nFirst, we can use databases of binary forms from [12]. Such\ndegree n > 2 binary forms are points in the projective space Pn.\nHowever, because of the way such databases were constructed most\nof those binary forms have minimal hight and would be useless\nto us for illustrating reduction methods. In order to have this data\n{f}s, for some index set S, useful for training, we can randomly act\non each binary form with random matrices M\u2208 SL2 (Z). The new\ndata {fM}s, will not, in general, have binary forms with minimum\nheights. However, we can design a machine learning model based\non {fM}s, and do the training of this model based on {f}s.\nSecond, we start with roots in the hyperbolic plane H2. We create\na database of n-gons with vertices \u03b1\u2081, ..., \u03b1\u03b3 \u2208 H2. For simplicity of\nthe argument here we assume we have no real roots, even though\nthe method can be easily extended in this case. Thus our binary\nform will be\n$f(x, y) = \\prod_{j=1}^{r}(x^2 - 2 Re(a_j)xy + ||a_j||^2y^2).$\nBinary forms of this type are called totally complex forms. In order\nto have f(x, y) with integer coefficients we can further assume that\n\u03b11,..., \u03b1\u03b3 \u20ac H\u2082 are Gaussian integers.\nTo control the location of the polygons we can assume that\nthe roots a1,..., an are always picked between radii r\u2081 and r2.\nThis assures that we don't take ones close to the fundamental\ndomain (so the affects of the reduction are more visible) or we\ndon't have floating issues in the case of very large coordinates. The\nmain question here becomes how to pick r\u2081 and r2 so we can get a\ndatabase of preferable size.\nThe number of Gaussian integers in this region is roughly \u03c0(r2 \u2013\nri) is related to the famous Gauss circle problem. Hence, we can\nalways have some estimate of how many points we will have in the\nregion and therefore the number of n-gons, which is much bigger\nthen the number of points in the region. As you will see below,\nthere are 37 090 735 triangles for r\u2081 1 and r2 = 20 and 8 936 928\npentagons for r\u2081 = 1 and r2 = 7.\nThese two very different approaches of creating a database of\nbinary forms are mostly forced upon us by the strategies of building\na training model.\nThe algebraic approach would be to ignore the geometry (roots\nof binary forms) and express the Julia invariant in terms of the\ncoefficients of the form ao,..., an. Since the Julia invariant is an\ninvariant of the form then it must be expressed in terms of such\ncoefficients. We can design a neural network such that the loss\nfunction is precisely this invariant. This would be very effective be-\ncause the minimum of the loss function would determine precisely\nthe value of the zero map and therefore the transformation needed\nto get the Julia reduction of the form. There is one major problem\nwith this approach. As Beshaj showed in her thesis [1] computation\nof the Julia invariant symbolically is extremely difficult even for\nsmall degree forms such as quartics, quintics, and sextics.\nHowever, geometrically this can be done rather easily for each n-gon as we illustrate next. We can numerically compute the roots of\nf(x) in the hyperbolic plave H2 including the real roots. Using the\nmethod described in Section 3.2 we can find the hyperbolic centroid\nof such roots.

For each one of such pentagons we have a totally\ncomplex binary decimic.\nIn Fig. 5 we graph the pentagon where such distance is the\nmaximum between all 8 936 928 pentagons for r\u2081 = 1 and r2 = 7. It\nbelongs to roots\n1+5i, 1+6i, 2+6i, 3+ 3i, 6+ i.\nThe corresponding degree ten binary form has height\nH(f) = 25 627 680\nThe center of mass has coordinates (2.6, 4.8) and the hyperbolic\ncentroid is (4, 24, 2.94). The shift corresponding to the Julia reduc-tion (resp. hyperbolic reduction) is f(x + 3, y) (resp. f (x + 4, y) )\nand has height H(Jul(f)) = 3862 800 (resp. H(Hyp f) = 3060 000).\nHence, again the hyperbolic reduction gets a better height, but\nnot the minimal height, which is obtained for f(x + 5, y) and it is\nh = 2 494, 440. The minimal polynomial is\nf(x) = (x2 \u2013 2x + 2)(x\u00b2 + 4x + 13)(x\u00b2 + 6x + 45)(x\u00b2 + 8x + 52)\nHence, it seems as what is happening is very similar as in the case\nof the triangles in the sense that it is closer to the far right vertex\nof the n-gon, but it does not exactly at the vertex as in the case of\ntriangles."}, {"title": "", "content": "We compared both reductions from all the data for triangles\nbetween circles r = 1 and r = 4 and found out that from all 11 628\nbinary decimics we have:\nHyperbolic reduction:\n2367\nJulia reduction:\n797\nSame result:\n8 464\nHence, again the hyperbolic reduction performs considerably better\nthan the Julia reduction.

Currently, subjective evaluation by neurologists is the primary method for hypomimia detection, and conventional rehabilitation approaches heavily rely on verbal prompts from rehabilitation physicians. There remains a deficiency in accessible, user-friendly and scientifically rigorous assistive tools for hypomimia treatments. To investigate this, we developed HypomimaCoach, an Action Unit (AU)-based digital therapy system for hypomimia detection and rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease. The HypomimaCoach system was designed to facilitate engagement through the incorporation of both relaxed and controlled rehabilitation exercises, while also stimulating initiative through the integration of digital therapies that incorporated traditional face training methods. We extract action unit(AU) features and their relationship for hypomimia detection. In order to facilitate rehabilitation, a series of training programmes have been devised based on the Action Units (AUs) and patients are provided with real-time feedback through an additional AU recognition model, which guides them through their training routines. A pilot study was conducted with seven participants in China, all of whom exhibited symptoms of Parkinson's disease hypomimia. The results of the pilot study demonstrated a positive impact on participants' self-efficacy, with favourable feedback received. Furthermore, physician evaluations validated the system's applicability in a therapeutic setting for patients with Parkinson's disease, as well as its potential value in clinical applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological disorder that requires long-term treatment and management, primarily affecting people aged 60 years and older [32]. It is estimated that by 2030, the number of PD patients in China will increase to form over half of the world's PD patients [17]. Research into more accessible and patient-friendly treatments is needed to reduce the burden on healthcare systems and individual patients. Hypomimia is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease characterized by deficits in facial expression, mainly in the form of impaired facial expression or reduced facial movements in patients [44]. It can also cause a range of complications, including language deficits (dysarthria, disruption of fluency, etc.), which are often accompanied by symptoms of depression, mood swings, and cognitive impairment.\nExisting researchers have devised various metrics to help physicians assess the severity of Parkinson's disease hypomimia [22, 50, 51], and a widely used clinical diagnostic method is the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) published by the World Federation of Neurology [21]. However, traditional clinical judgment of hypomimia symptoms in Parkinson's disease relies heavily on in-person assessment by an experienced neurologist [7]. This approach often faces time and space constraints that may prevent timely disease detection and intervention. In addition, limited healthcare resources hinder the ability of patients to effectively self-assess and rehabilitate their hypomimia. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to detect hypomimia provides a convenient way to diagnose Parkinson's disease, thereby actually facilitating early detection and intervention of hypomimia symptoms [36, 61]. Previous studies have extensively explored the use of AI models in Action Unit(AU) [18] recognition [37, 41], achieving high accuracy in labeling facial action units. Despite this potential, there are substantial gaps in research on the clinical applications of these quantifiable AUs in diagnosis and rehabilitation. Therefore, it is crucial to develop more objective and accurate assessment tools for facial rehabilitation and to explore strategies for seamlessly integrating AI techniques into facial rehabilitation training.\nTargeted training of facial and tongue muscles for Parkinson's patients can effectively alleviate facial stiffness. Traditional methods of facial training [33, 33, 34] require patients to voluntarily exercise their facial muscles, and patient autonomy and participation in the training is critical. However, in current clinical practice, adherence to these exercises is often challenging and patients vary in their condition and the severity of their facial symptoms. Consistent execution of the exercises cannot be guaranteed. Digital therapies offer Parkinson's patients more flexible, convenient, and accessible rehabilitation options for transitioning from the clinical setting to everyday life than traditional rehabilitation methods, with the potential to improve recovery outcomes and overall quality of life. Digital therapies can psychologically alleviate tension, anxiety, and depression in patients, increasing acceptance and engagement. Researchers have explored digital treatments for facial disorders. For example, Liu et al. [40] developed a Parkinson's hypomimia game, which was explored and experimented with as a treatment. However, there is still a lack of research on the clinical application of digital therapeutic tools for hypomimia that can be widely used, and people with Parkinson's disease may face problems with the accessibility of specialized and systematic digital therapeutic tools, especially in resource-limited areas.\nSelf-determination theory [14] states that the motivation to use a product depends on the extent to which the product fulfills the basic needs of autonomy, relevance, and competence. Systems capable of artificial intelligence combined with traditional medical rehabilitation therapy can increase relevance and also give the user more autonomy. Thus, allowing users to interact through familiar, easy, and novel interfaces may be a solution to increase user engagement and treatment outcomes. Self-efficacy is an important belief that needs to be improved in people with Parkinson's disease because it enables individuals to develop confidence in their ability to control their motivation, behavior, and social environment. High self-efficacy prevents the negative effects of emotionally oriented coping. Improving self-efficacy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease after masked hypomimia may have beneficial long-term effects. Digital interventions can positively impact self-efficacy in people with Parkinson's by promoting positive behavioral change and increasing confidence in managing symptoms. Digital technologies, such as mobile apps and online platforms, are developed and utilized to provide patients with easy access to rehabilitation resources and support. These technologies can provide timely feedback, progress tracking, and interactive training, and this flexibility and personalized attention can further enhance patients' self-efficacy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the use of digital interventions in the rehabilitation of patients with PD hypomimia and how they can be a potentially valuable addition to existing research on digital therapies.\nOverall, we sought to answer the following research questions.\n\u2022 RQ1: How can artificial intelligence techniques be applied to help patients diagnose and treat Parkinson's hypomimia symptoms?\n\u2022 RQ2: How to design interactive tools for digital therapies applicable to patients with Parkinson's hypomimia symptoms?\nTo answer these questions, the researchers in this thesis designed a detection and rehabilitation training system based on facial action expression units (AUs), relying on existing artificial intelligence facial action unit recognition technology. The detection process includes four steps: data acquisition and preprocessing, facial AU feature extraction, facial AU feature fusion, and hypomimia classification. Parkinson's disease hypomimia faces characterized by reduced facial movements and expressions can be captured more accurately by Action Units (AU) analysis. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) further improve the model performance by utilizing the interconnectivity of AUs. Based on a comprehensive review of existing facial rehabilitation techniques, we present a novel interactive training system utilizing action units (AUs). By combining targeted exercises for the brow, eye muscles, cheeks, nose, lips, and articulation with AI-based feedback, we develop a digital therapy with real-time feedback that enables users to actively participate in their rehabilitation process. The method quantifies the extent of facial movements, which allows for better assessment of facial movements in Parkinson's patients and helps physicians better develop rehabilitation programs. Combined with traditional facial"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "2.1 Clinical Facial Detection and Rehabilitation\nfor Parkinson's Disease\nA variety of rating scales have been designed to evaluate the severity of Parkinson's disease, including the Hoehn and Yahr staging scale [26], the UK Queen Square Brain Bank Criteria [20], the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [48], and the MDS-UPDRS[48]. Nevertheless, the application of these scales is often constrained by the neurologist's experience and subjective assessment, as well as factors such as time and distance.\nClinical facial rehabilitation is a therapeutic intervention aimed at improving facial movement and expression control in individuals with facial muscle dysfunction. Thai massage, Japanese massage, Traditional Chinese Tuina, and some other manual therapies have clinical records demonstrating their ability to improve motor function in PD patients [33]. Chen et al. [33] introduced a passive massage rehabilitation exercise for hypomimia patients, reporting positive outcomes in facial expression and sleep quality. Karp et al.[34] demonstrated a strong association between facial rehabilitation and improved Facial Grading Scale (FGS) scores in facial nerve paralysis patients. Zheng et al. [31] compared facial rehabilitation treatment with traditional medication and acupuncture for facial nerve neuritis, revealing enhanced effectiveness of facial paralysis rehabilitation exercises. This approach heavily relies on the physician's subjective evaluation, and traditional methods often lack real-time feedback and quantitative assessment mechanisms. Moreover, given limited healthcare resources, patients struggle to access scientific and professional guidance, hindering their ability to effectively self-assess and train their hypomimia.\n2.2 Al technologies for Hypomimia in\nParkinson's Disease\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems are showing an increasing promise for numerous healthcare applications. Recently, the advantages of Deep Learning (DL) are spawning Al systems with human-like performance in several clinical domains [8, 9, 23, 55, 57]. Artificial intelligence technologies have been applied in clinical treatment, medical research, and healthcare professional decision support. The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms for hypomimia detection provides a convenient avenue for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, thereby enabling early detection and intervention. In previous research, Bandini et al. [4] extracted 49 facial keypoints and 20 facial features to detect hypomimia. Grammat et al. [22] leveraged FaceAPI for keypoints extraction to construct linear regression model to detect. Su et al. [59] utilized geometric and texture features extracted from facial images for detection. Later, Su et al. [58] trained an end-to-end model employing RGB image sequences and optical flow sequences in a dual-channel framework, incorporating temporal dynamic features. Recognizing the difficulties faced by Parkinson's patients in seeking in-person medical attention due to mobility issues and other factors [59], AI-driven Parkinson's detection facilitates remote diagnosis, alleviating temporal and spatial constraints in disease assessment.\nThe Facial Action Coding System (FACS) [18] provides anatomically defined codes for precise characterization of facial expression changes, encapsulating various facial muscle movement states through Facial Action Units (AUs). AUs are the basic units of facial movement, each corresponding to a specific contraction or relaxation of a facial muscle or muscle group. By identifying and coding these AUS, FACS allows for a detailed and objective analysis of facial expressions, enabling researchers to study the relationship between facial expressions and various psychological states, emotions, and behaviors. Previous studies have extensively explored the utilization of AI models for AU recognition, achieving high levels of accuracy in labeling facial action units. Liu et al. [41] introduced a deep learning framework using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for AU detection. Li et al. [37] explored semantic relationships among AUs in deep neural networks, enhancing feature representation in facial regions through the AU Semantic Relationship Embedding Representation Learning (SRERL) framework. Although AI models have advanced AU recognition capabilities, bridging the gap between these technological advancements and clinical rehabilitation practice remains a challenge. Action Units (AUs), which provide a quantitative measure of facial expressions, have seen significant advancements in their recognition through AI models. Despite this potential, there is a substantial gap in research regarding the clinical application of these quantifiable AUs in diagnosis and rehabilitation. Therefore, developing more objective and accurate facial rehabilitation assessment tools and exploring strategies for seamlessly integrating AI technologies into facial rehabilitation training is of paramount importance.\n2.3 Digital Therapy for Hypomimia in\nParkinson's Disease\nDigital therapies provide a more accessible treatment paradigm than traditional rehabilitation treatments and can psychologically"}, {"title": "3 Formative Study", "content": "The primary objectives are: (1) To elicit insights from neurologists regarding their perspectives on issues relevant to hypomimia. (2) To understand the patients' needs for developing a digital therapy system. In order to investigate how AI technology can be applied in the detection and rehabilitation of hypomimia patients with Parkinson's disease, we conducted a formative study to gather information on the following aspects: (1) Physicians' attitudes toward hypomimia treatment.(2) Patients' engagement in hypomimia rehabilitation. (3) Design opportunities for the Al interaction system.\n3.1 Method\nwe proactively established formative study with neurologists and rehabilitation physicians in a hospital in China, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of the background knowledge. We collaborated closely with a group of four neurologists and two rehabilitation physicians. These physicians, each with an average of over ten years of experience in their respective fields, brought a substantial wealth of expertise to our research endeavor.\nTo explore the practical application of hypomimia therapy methods in rehabilitation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with rehabilitation professionals. We sought answers to the research questions. By addressing these questions: RQ1: How can artificial intelligence techniques be applied to help patients diagnose and treat Parkinson's hypomimia symptoms? RQ2: How to design interactive tools for digital therapies applicable to patients with Parkinson's hypomimia symptoms? We aim to derive insights that can inform the design of AI-powered therapy systems within the HCI research community. At the same time, to study how treatment practices shape patient initiative and motivation.\n3.2 Key Findings and Design Implications\n3.2.1 Cognitive problems in patients. We found that the current diagnosis of hypomimia depends on the subjective expertise of neurologists, necessitating extensive clinical experience and requiring patients tow invest significant time and effort in hospitals. In the field of hypomimia rehabilitation, which usually involves verbal instructions from physicians, advising patients to engage in various facial exercises such as blowing up balloons, puffing cheeks, or blowing out candles to improve facial expressiveness. However, patients often lack a clear understanding of appropriate exercises and techniques and lack professional planning to guide them.\nPeople with Parkinson's disease may have impairments in attention maintenance and information processing speed, which can affect their ability to multitask simultaneously. Interviews with physicians provided insight into the current state of digital therapies in healthcare organizations, which rely heavily on specific hardware setups. For example, there are eye-tracking games specifically designed to address cognitive disabilities. These interactive systems prioritize simplicity of user interaction and aim to be easy to learn and operate. However, facial movements are highly complex and there is a need to develop a tool to assess the complex dynamics of facial movements and provide feedback to patients. Combining the above issues, our goals are 1) Patients need a clear, intuitive, and user-friendly interaction interface that minimizes interaction complexity and reduces textual interfaces. 2) To conduct a rational rehabilitation program planning to present the rehabilitation process and effects in a quantitative manner.\n3.2.2 Emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety. Through interviews conducted with neurologist, we found that patients with Parkinson's disease often experience various comorbidities, including emotional disturbances. Emotional issues such as depression and anxiety are common among individuals with Parkinson's disease, which may affect patients' life quality and the disease progress. As a result of the facial expression disorder, patients will be less likely to look in the mirror and thus lack rehabilitation exercises for their hypomimia symptoms. Acceptance of the disease and the"}, {"title": "4 System Design and Implementation", "content": "4.1 Hypomimia Detection\nThe detection pipeline includes 4 steps, which are data collection and preprocessing, facial AU feature extration, facial AU feature fusion and hypomimia classification. Figure 2 1 depicts the pipeline of the proposed method. Hypomimia in Parkinson's disease, characterized by reduced facial movement and expression, can be more precisely captured through the analysis of Action Units (AUs). Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) further enhance model performance by leveraging the interconnectedness of AUs.\n4.1.1 Data collection and preprocessing. Due to the limited public dataset in hypomimia, we collected hypomimia dataset to train the detection model. The dataset was collected at a hospital's Department of Neurology, ensuring that all procedures involving human subjects adhered to established ethical guidelines. The total hypomimia videos is 105 sample, consisting of 55 facial video recordings from healthy subjects and 50 from patients with Parkinson's Disease. We recorded frontal facial movements of participants using a smartphone in 1920\u00d71080 pixels with 60 frames per second. Participants were first asked to face the camera with a neutral expression, followed by a gentle smile. The video captured both the neutral and smiling expressions, with approximately 30 seconds of footage collected from each participant. Stringent controls were implemented for variables including lighting conditions and head positioning.\nIn the data preprocessing, the MTCNN[48] model was utilized for frame-by-frame segmentation of the video streams, enabling facial recognition, alignment, and normalization for each frame. Following MTCNN processing, the smiling videos were partitioned into training, validation, and test sets based on individual participants, employing the hold-out method. This resulted in a 60-20-20 split, with 60 participants in the training set, 20 in the validation set,\n4.1.2 Facial AU feature extraction. After processing each frame of the facial images, a pretrained Swin Transformer [49] model is utilized to produce a 1x2048 feature vector encapsulating facial information. The encoder encompasses both fully connected (FC) layers and global average pooling (GAP) layers. Within the FC layers, eight AU extractors were responsible for feature extraction from facial representations, resulting in eight distinct AU feature maps. The GAP layer computed an average value for all pixels in each channel. Subsequent to this global average pooling step, weed obtain eight separate feature vectors. Facial Action Units (AUs) are not independent features but rather an interconnected system. Based on this characteristic, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) to aggregate the relationships between facial features. The acquired AU features were considered as nodes in a graph. Relationships considered as edges among AUs were established using k-nearest neighbor (k=2) connectivity, determined by node proximity. Subsequently, after constructing the graph structure of AUs, graph convolution operations were employed to convert unrelated AUs into related AUs.\nWe adopted a transfer learning approach to enhance AU feature extraction. Initially, the model was pre-trained on a dataset with AU labels, focusing on learning the features associated with eight specific AUs: AU1, AU2, AU4, AU6, AU9, AU12, AU25, AU26 from the DISFA dataset [43]. By leveraging the pre-trained model's ability to extract fundamental facial features, this approach mitigates the challenges posed by the scarcity of hypomimia dataset.\n4.1.3 Facial AU feature classification. After graph convolution, we acquired eight AU features containing their relational information. The eight features were used as inputs for training a neural network (NN), comprising two convolutional layers (CNN) [35]. Stochastic gradient descent(SGD) was employed as the feature optimizer, and the cross-entropy loss function served as the loss function. The results in Table 4 illustrated the discerning efficacy of this algorithm, highlighting its superior discrimination capability compared to other machine learning models, thereby validating the efficacy of utilizing AU features for masked face identification.\n4.2 Hypomimia Rehabilitation\n4.2.1 AU-based rehabilitation training design. Building upon a thorough review of existing facial rehabilitation techniques for hypomimia, we introduce a novel, interactive training system that leverages Action Units (AUs). By integrating targeted exercises for the eyebrows, ocular muscles, cheeks, nose, lips, and articulation with AU-based feedback, we have developed a personalized rehabilitation approach that empowers users to actively engage in their recovery process. Table 2(Appendix) presents a detailed overview of our AU-based rehabilitation trainings.\nTo recognize AUs, we leveraged the openGraphAU [42] model, which excels at identifying the movements associated with 41 distinct AUs and quantifying their activation levels. This model provides a quantitative measure of facial movements, enabling us to precisely track changes in facial expressions over time. As depicted in Fig. 2, HypomimiaCoach employs this model to analyze user facial expressions and offer tailored feedback.\n4.2.2 Chinese-opera based music interactive design. Music therapy, which involves regular sessions with a qualified music therapist, has been shown to improve mood through emotional expression [1]. Traditional Chinese opera, with its centuries-old history, unique charm, and profound cultural impact [62], is characterized by diverse regional variations and evokes empathetic responses from local audiences. Recognizing the potential benefits of Chinese opera's phonetic distinctiveness for improving single-character pronunciation training in seniors, we have incorporated it into our rehabilitation program.\nTo enhance the effectiveness of the training, we strategically matched different training content with specific styles of traditional Chinese opera. For instance, lively operas like \"Rolling Lantern\" are well-suited for lip movement exercises, while melodious, extended pieces like \"The Case of Chen Shimei\" are ideal for pronunciation"}, {"title": "5 User Study", "content": "To evaluate the system, we conducted a user study focusing on participants' engagement, initiative, and self-efficacy during rehabilitation training. The study was conducted at a public hospital in China and received ethical approval.\n5.1 Participants\nWe conducted two evaluation experiments: the first, patient-oriented (n=7 Parkinson's Disease patients with hypomimia, average age: 69.57, average MDS-UPDRS hypomimia severity score: 2.29); the second, physician-focused (n=10 physicians, 7 from neurology department, and 3 from rehabilitation department). The demographic characteristics of the participants are reported in Table 3.\n5.2 Procedure\n5.2.1 Experiment Setup. This study was carried out in a dedicated communication room within the neurology ward of a hospital, which consisted of two distinct sections: an interview area and an experimental area. In the interview area, a research facilitator conducted participant interviews, while a recorder was responsible for audio recording and documentation, with both participants and their caregivers present. In the experimental area, an operator assisted users with system usage, a physician observed participants' interactions with the system, and another recorder was responsible for observing, and recording video footage, with once again both participants and their caregivers present.\n5.2.2 Pre-test. The project's content and objectives were introduced to participants and their caregivers. Ethical concerns regarding data usage and privacy protection were clarified. After obtaining consent from participants and their caregivers, informed consent forms were signed. Prior to the start of the study, each participant underwent an initial assessment that included a facial expression test, a depressed mood test, and a self-perception of hypomimia symptoms. An interview was conducted to ask the participant about basic information, symptoms, duration of onset, pre- and post-onset differences, and acceptance of electronic devices. A physician assessed the severity of the participant's hypomimia. Participants were introduced to the rehabilitation training system and received brief training on how to use it. They were then asked to use the system for 20 to 30 minutes of supervised rehabilitation session.\n5.2.3 During Test. Participants were invited to the experimental area and seated in computer chairs facing computer screens. Initially, the operator guided participants in assessing hypomimia using a facial detection model. Subsequently, rehabilitation training commenced. The operator provided guidance on using a one-minute version of our system for facial training. After participants were familiarised with the use of the system, a round of 3-minute advanced training and a round of basic training for each area of the face were performed. A doctor and caregiver were present throughout the experiment to observe the participants' behaviour.\n5.2.4 Post Test. After testing, participants and their caregivers were invited back to the interview area for a 15-minute semi-structured interview. The questionnaire was presented in the form of a modified interview with the participant in order to accommodate potential cognitive challenges for some participants. The questions included an assessment of system usability, system engagement and self-efficacy. Further interviews were conducted to address the participant's experience of using the system. After the participants' experiment, physicians were tasked with completing a project-specific questionnaire. While completing the questionnaire, physicians were encouraged to offer additional explanations for their ratings on specific items. Following this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the physicians to delve further into the questionnaire items and gain more profound insights into their feedback and perspectives.\n5.3 Measures\n5.3.1 Assessment of engagement and autonomy. As our formative survey showed, increasing participants engagement and autonomy in their rehabilitation training activities was a key design goal of our system. Understanding user preferences and satisfaction with the system by observing the duration and level of engagement of users interacting with the system can help assess willingness and level of participation. Autonomy can be indirectly assessed through questionnaires that allow subjects to rate their level of efficacy in specific tasks or domains. In addition, self-efficacy is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms. Thus, by comparing participants' mood state assessments before and after using the system, we can further reveal changes in self-efficacy.\n5.3.2 Usability Assessment. In order to navigate each user flow, participants had to make specific facial expression movements or"}, {"title": "6 Results", "content": "6.1 Engagement of Participants\n6.1.1 Task completion. All participants successfully completed both rounds of the rehabilitation training tasks, the average length of the basic and advanced training was three minutes, and all participants successfully completed each task, with overall accuracy varying from person to person. Almost all participants understood the training content and participated attentively. In the lip and articulation portion of the training, participants had lower mean accuracy scores, and there were instances where lip movements were misunderstood and movements were not performed properly. The articulation training most participants understood the articulation movements and blended well with the music and with the opera background. The majority of participants felt that the system was definitely helpful for pronunciation improvement. Feedback was collected from users on the difficulty of the tasks and their participation experience. Some participants found the task challenging, \"Simple movements are good to learn. Combinations of the more complicated movements felt bad to do and slower would be better. The basic training model was relatively easy and a little easier to imitate.\"\nFor example, PD3 is an individual experiencing early-stage symptoms of Parkinson's disease. He is a former enthusiastic singer, has faced recent challenges in facial and vocal expressions, resulting in unclear speech and emotional distress. He stated, \"I noticed that I sounded weaker compared to before, which made me reluctant to sing. My doctor advised me to work on my face and talk more, but I didn't know what to do.\" After using the system, pd3 felt that this game form of rehab was better than traditional rehab, but felt that it was a little complicated to use for the first time, 'I didn't know the difference between the two modes when I used the system, it felt like both were similar because I didn't get into the groove.\"\nPD7, another participant with early-stage Parkinson's symptoms, was previously an outgoing individual who enjoyed making dance videos on TikTok. The disease, however, led her to feel insecure and anticipate a decline in her quality of life. She experienced daily mood fluctuations. After trying our system, she found the tasks to be highly correlated with her rehabilitation goals, stating, \"I find this format wonderful. Music synchronized with facial exercises significantly improves my mood. The exercises make me feel that my symptoms have improved. The physician recommended daily exercise, and with a system like this, I can engage in systematic training. I believe that through these exercises, I can delay the potential onset of symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease.\"\n6.1.2 Participants' satisfaction interacting with the system. Understanding user satisfaction with the system can help assess willingness and level of participation. A 5-point Likert scale was used to collect participant and physician ratings of satisfaction with the system's interaction and digital therapy. In terms of interaction, participants' mean scores for satisfaction with the interaction method (M = 3.29, SD = 0.88), satisfaction with the opera music (M = 3.57, SD = 0.73), and satisfaction with the operatic filter (M = 3.33, SD = 0.94). Through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, most participants perceived the music format as engaging and encouraging to sing it out together. This preference suggests that systematic digital therapy is attractive and effective for these participants, improving their self-efficacy by making the recovery process more enjoyable and manageable.\nHowever, satisfaction with Chinese opera music mainly depended on the individual participant's interest in opera music. Participants rated the opera filter moderately, believing that they did not enhance the entertainment value of the training exercise. Some expressed the opinion, \"I didn't notice the opera filters.\" and \"I don't care if there are operatic filters as long as the rehab relieves the symptoms of hypomimia.\" Of the 7 participants, 6 participants reported feeling relief in their face after completing the training, 5 participants felt that the method improved their articulation, and all 7 participants reported feeling more emotionally relaxed. PD7 thought the system was helpful for mood improvement, \"I feel curious about the system. Feeling in a good mood because it feels helpful. If my doctor requires that I train every day, then it's okay for me to train once or twice a day.\""}, {"title": "7 Discussion", "content": "In this section, we discuss the potential of this system for use in future clinical practice and provide a set of insights for future designers entering the domain.\n7.1 Reasonable Training Time, Frequency and\nPractice Strategy\nIn this study, we gain insights into the timing and methodology of rehabilitation training.

But even reliable sources such as domain experts, do not always agree.\nTo be able to reason with inconsistent knowledge it is not possible to view a set of premisses as absolute truths, as in predicate logic. Viewing a set of premisses as a set of assumptions, however, makes it possible to deduce useful conclusions from an inconsistent set of premisses. As long as we do not have it proven otherwise, the premisses are assumed to be true statements about the world. When, however, a contradiction is derived, we can no longer make this assumption. To restore consistency, one of the premisses has to be removed. To be able to select a premiss to be removed, a reliability relation on the premisses will be used.

These premisses are assumed to be true as long as we do not derive a contradiction from them. If, however, a contradiction is derived, we have to determine the premisses on which the contradiction is based. The premisses on which a contradiction is based are the premisses used in the derivation of the contradiction. When we know these premisses, we have to remove one of them to block the derivation of the contradiction. To select a premiss to be removed, I will use a reliability relation. This reliability relation denotes the relative reliability of the premisses. It denotes that one premiss is more reliable than some other premiss.

This set can be determined by enumerating the premisses with respect to the linear extension of the reliability relation, starting with the most reliable premiss. Starting with an empty set D, if a premiss may consistently be added to the set D, it should be added. Otherwise it must be ignored.

This approach results in one deduction tree instead of a deduction sequence for every linear extension of \u4eba.\nInstead of deriving new propositions, only new arguments are derived. These arguments are generated by the inference rules. The reason why arguments instead of propositions are derived, is that the propositions that can be believed (the belief set) depend on the set of premisses that can still be believed. Since this set of premisses may change because of new information derived, the belief set can change in a non-monotonic way. The arguments, however, do not depend on the information derived. Furthermore, they contain all the information needed to determine the premisses that can still be believed and the corresponding belief set.

Therefore, if the consequent of an undermining argument P # 4 is the most reliable premiss that can be remove, because we still belief the premisses in the antecedent P, removing will never have to be undone. After having removed o we can turn to the next most reliable consequent of an undermining argument.\nThe time complexity of the algorithm below depends on the for and the repeat loop. The former loop can be executed in O(n) steps where n in the number of undermining arguments. The latter loop can be executed in O(m) steps where m in the number of premisses in \u03a3.

In [22, 23] Shoham argues that the difference between monotonic logic and non-monotonic logic is a difference in the definition of the entailment relation. In a monotonic logic a proposition is entailed by the premisses if it is true in every model for the premisses. In a non-monotonic logic, however, a proposition is entailed by the premisses if it is preferentially entailed by a set of premisses; i.e. if it is true in every preferred model for the premisses. These preferred models are determined by defining an acyclic partial preference order on the models.\nThe semantics for the logic differs slightly from Shoham's approach. Since the set of premisses may be inconsistent, the set of models for these premisses can be empty. Therefore, instead of defining a preference relation on the models of the premisses, a partial preference relation on the set of semantic interpretations for the language is defined.

Here the belief set must be changed in such a way that the resulting belief set is consistent. Contraction is the change necessary to stop believing some proposition. For each of these forms of belief revision, G\u00e4rdenfors has formulated a set of rationality postulates.\nIn this subsection I will investigate which of the postulates are satisfied by the logic. To be able to do this, the set of theorems of a reliability theory is identified as a belief set as defined by G\u00e4rdenfors.

Furthermore we have to replace the logical axioms for a propositional logic by the logical axioms for a first order logic with the modus ponens as the only inference rule.

He introduces his reasoning method, because he wants to formalize hypothetical reasoning. In particular, he wants to formalize reasoning with belief contravening hypotheses, such as counterfactuals. In the case of counter-factual reasoning, we make an assumption that we know to be false. For example, let us suppose that Plato had lived during the middle ages. To be able to make such a counter factual assumption, we, temporally, have to give up some of our beliefs to maintain consistency. It is, however, not always clear which of our beliefs we have to give up. The following example gives an illustration.\nExample 40\nBeliefs\n1. Bizet was of French nationality.\n2. Verdi was of Italian nationality.\n3. Compatriots are persons who share the same nationality.\nHypothesis Assume that Bizet and Verdi are compatriots.\nThere are three possibilities to restore consistency. Clearly, we do not wish to witdraw 3, but we are indifferent whether we should give up 1 or 2.\nTo model this behaviour in a logical system, Rescher divides the set of premisses into modal categories. The modalities Rescher proposes are: alethic modalities, epistemic modalities, modalities based on inductive warrant, and modalities based on probability or confirmation. Given a set of modal categories, he selects Preferred Maximal Mutually-Compatible subsets (PMMC subsets) from them. The procedure for selecting these subsets is as follows:\nLet Mo, ..., Mn be a family of modal categories.\n1. Select a maximal consistent subset of Mo and let this be the set So.\n2. Form S by adding as many premisses of Mi to Si\u22121 as possible without disturbing the consistency of Si.\nSn is a PMMC-subset.\nGiven these PMMC-subsets, Rescher defines two entailment relations.\n\u2022 Compatible-Subset (CS) entailment.

A proposition is CR entailed if it follows from some PMMC-subset."}, {"title": "A framework for default reasoning", "content": "The central idea behind Poole's approach is that default reasoning should be viewed as scientific theory formation [13]. Given a set of facts about the world and a set of hypotheses, a subset of the hypotheses which together with the facts can explain an observation, have to be selected. Of course, this selected set of hypotheses has to be consistent with the facts. A default rule is represented in Poole's framework by a hypothesis containing free variables. Such a hypothesis represents a set of ground instances of the hypothesis. Each of these ground instances can be used independently of the other instances in an explanation. An explanation for a proposition \u03c6 is a maximal (with respect to the inclusion relation) scenario that implies \u03c6. Here a scenario is a consistent set containing all the facts and some ground instances of the hypotheses.\nThis framework can be viewed as a special case of Rescher's work. Poole's framework consists of only two modal categories, the facts Mo and the hypotheses M\u2081.\nSince Rescher's work is a special case of the logic described in this paper, so is Poole's framework. Poole, however, extends his framework with constraints. These constraints are added to be able to eliminate some scenarios as possible explanations for a formula 4. A scenario is eliminated when it is not consistent with the constraints.\nThe constraints can be interpreted as describing that some scenarios are preferred to others. Since in the logic described in this paper a reliability relation on the premisses generates a preference relation on consistent subsets of the premisses, an obvious question is whether the preference relation described by the constraints can be modelled with an appropriate reliability relation. Unfortunately, the answer is 'no'. This is illustrated by the following example.\nExample 41\nFacts: \u03c6, \u03c8.\nDefaults: 4 \u2192 \u03b1, \u03c6 \u2192 \u00ab\u03b2, \u03c8 \u2192 \u00ac\u03b1, \u03c8 \u2192 \u03b2.\nConstraints: \u00ac(a\u2227 \u03b2), \u00ac\u00ac\u0430 \u2227\u00ac\u03b2).\nWithout the constraints this theory has four different extensions. These extensions are the logical consequences of the following scenarios.\nS\u2081 = {\u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b1,\u03c6 \u2192 \u00ac\u03b2}"}, {"title": "Paraconsistent logics", "content": "Paraconsistent logics are a class of logics developed for reasoning with inconsistent knowledge [1]. Unlike classical logics, in paraconsistent logics there need not hold (\u00ac \u00ac6) for some proposition 4. Hence, an inconsistent set of premisses is not equivalent to the trivial theory; it does not imply the set of all propositions.\nUnlike the logic described in this paper, a paraconsistent logic does not resolve an inconsistency. Instead it simply avoids that everything follows from an inconsistent theory. To illustrate this more clearly, consider the following a reliability theory, without a reliability relation.\n\u2211 = {\u03b1^\u03b2, \u00ab\u03b2^\u04af}\nIn the logic described in this paper, all maximal consistent subsets will be generated.\n{\u03b1^\u03b2} and {\u00ab\u03b2\u03b3}\nIn a paraconsistent logic the proposition \u1e9e will be contradictory but the propositions a and y will consistently be entailed by the premisses."}, {"title": "Truth maintenance systems", "content": "In the here presented logic arguments are used. Justifications in the JTMS of J. Doyle [4] or the ATMS of J. de Kleer [11] have a similar function as arguments. Unlike the arguments used here, these justifications are not part of the deduction process. The arguments used here follow directly from the requirement for the deduction process (Section 2). Moreover, in a(n) (A)TMS the justifications describe dependencies between propositions, while in the here presented logic, the supporting arguments describe dependencies between propositions and premisses, and undermining arguments describe dependencies among premisses. The supporting arguments of the logic, however, can be compared with the labels in the ATMS [11]. Like a label, a supporting argument describes from which premisses a proposition is derived. The undermining arguments have more or less the same function as a nogood in the ATMS. As with an element from the set representing a nogood, the consequent and the antecedents of an undermining argument may not be assumed to be true simultaneously. Unlike an element of the set nogood, an undermining argument describes which element has to be removed from the set of premisses (assumptions).\nBecause supporting arguments and labels are closely related, it is possible to describe an ATMS using a propositional logic. Let (A, N, J) be an ATMS where:\n\u2022 A is a set of assumptions,\n\u2022 N is a set of nodes, and\n\u2022 Jis a set of justifications.\nWe can model the ATMS in the logic using the following construction.

In this section two applications will be discussed."}, {"title": "Unreliable knowledge sources", "content": "In situations where we must deal with sensor data the logic described in the previous sections can be applied. To be able to reason with sensor data, the data has to be translated into statements about the world. Because of measurements errors and of misinterpretation of the data, these statements can be incorrect. This may result in inconsistencies. These inconsistencies may be resolved by considering the reliability of the knowledge sources used. To illustrate this consider the following example.\nExample 42 Suppose that we want to determine the type of an airplane by using the characteristic of its radar reflection. The radar reflection of an airplane depends on the size and the shape of plane. Suppose that we have some pattern recognition system that outputs a proposition stating the type of plane, or a disjunction of possible types in case of uncertainty. Furthermore, suppose that we have an additional system that determines the speed and the course of the plane. The output of this system will also be stated as a proposition. Given the output of the two systems, we can verify whether they are compatible. If a plane is recognized as a Dakota and its speed is 1.5 Mach, then, knowing that a Dakota cannot go through the sound barrier, we can derive a conflict. Since the speed measuring system is more reliable than the type identifying system, we must remove the proposition stating that the plane is a Dakota.\nIn this example, the reliability relation can be interpreted as denoting that if two premisses are involved in a conflict the least reliable premiss has the highest probability of being wrong. Since the relative probability is conditional on inconsistencies, information from one reliable source cannot be overruled by information from many unreliable knowledge sources. For example, the position of an object determined"}, {"title": "Planning", "content": "Another possible application for the logic can be found in the area of planning. In [9], Ginsberg and Smith describe a possible worlds approach for reasoning about actions. What they propose is an alternative way of determining the consequences of an action. Instead of using frame axioms, default rules, or add and delete lists. They propose to determine the nearest world that is consistent with the consequences of an action. The advantage of this approach is that we do not have to know all possible consequences of an action in advance. For example, in general, we cannot know whether putting a plant on a table will obscure a picture on the wall. Hence, if we know that a picture is not obscured before an action, we may assume that it is still not obscured after the action when this fact is consistent with the consequences of the action."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In this paper a logic for reasoning with inconsistent knowledge has been described. One of the original motivations for developing this logic was based on the view that default reasoning is as a special case of reasoning with inconsistent knowledge. To describe defaults in this logic, such as Poole's framework for default reasoning, formulas containing free variables can be used. These formulas denote a set of ground instances. If we do not generate these ground instances, but, by using unification of terms containing free variables, we reason with formulas containing free variables, we can derive conclusions representing sets of instances. This would seem to be a very useful property.\nSince, in the logic described here a default rule can only be described by using material implication, a default rule has a contraposition. It is possible, however, the contraposition may not hold for default rules. For example, the contraposition of the default rule:\u2018someone who owns a driving licence, may drive a car' is not valid. A better candidate for a default reasoning would be Reiter's Default logic [14] or Brewka's aproach [3].\nAlthough it is likely that the logic is not suited for default reasoning, it is suited for reasoning with knowledge coming from different and not fully reliable knowledge sources. For this use of the logic, it seems plausible that the logic satisfies the properties of system P. As was shown in the examples described in Section 10, the reliability relation can be given a plausible probabilistic and ontological interpretations.

Despite their capabilities, LLMs are limited by their reliance on static pre-trained datasets, which restricts their ability to incorporate dynamic, domain-specific, or private data into their responses. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this challenge by integrating external data retrieval with generative processes, providing more context-aware and accurate outputs.\nTraditional RAG systems typically employ single-agent architectures where a single system is responsible for query generation, data retrieval, and response synthesis. While effective for basic use cases, these monolithic designs often face limitations when dealing with diverse data sources, such as relational databases, document stores, and graph-based data [19]. These systems also require elaborate prompts containing schemas, examples, and user queries, leading to inefficiencies in token usage, increased processing latency, and potential inaccuracies in query handling.\nTo overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Multi-Agent RAG system [22, 23]. Unlike traditional approaches, this system delegates the task of query generation to specialized agents, each tailored to a specific type of database. These agents generate optimized, database-specific queries without directly executing or retrieving data. Queries are executed in a separate execution environment, ensuring compatibility with diverse data storage systems. The retrieved context is then combined with the user's original query and processed by a generative agent, which synthesizes a coherent and contextually relevant response.\nThe proposed system introduces a modular design that improves scalability, enhances retrieval accuracy, and supports seamless integration with polyglot data environments [20]. By delegating specific tasks to specialized agents and incorporating a centralized execution mechanism, this system addresses the inefficiencies of traditional single-agent RAG implementations. It offers a robust solution for integrating domain-specific and heterogeneous data into generative Al workflows, making it well-suited for a wide range of real-world applications."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)", "content": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external or private data into the response generation process. Unlike traditional LLMs that generate responses based solely on their pre-trained knowledge [1], RAG systems retrieve relevant domain-specific data from external sources to provide contextually accurate and up-to-date outputs. This is particularly useful when dealing with private or proprietary data that is inaccessible to the LLM during training. [3, 9, 10]\nThe retrieval phase is critical in RAG as it forms the foundation for accurate and relevant responses. For example, when a user asks, \"What is Machine Learning?\" the LLM can generate a generic response from its pre-trained knowledge. However, if the user asks, \"What is the role of AI and ML in the XYZ development team?\" the system needs to retrieve private context, such as \u201cThe XYZ team uses AI for predictive analytics and natural language processing,\" to provide a tailored and meaningful response. The integration of retrieved context with generative capabilities ensures that the outputs are both accurate and relevant.\nTraditional RAG Systems, which rely on single-agent architectures, face challenges in managing multiple data sources. These systems are prone to inefficiencies, including token overload and inaccurate query generation, especially when handling diverse data storage types. The need for a more scalable and efficient approach has led to the development of the Multi-Agent RAG system."}, {"title": "2.2 Agents and Multi-Agent RAG Systems", "content": "In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [3] system, a single agent [21] is capable of handling query generation and data retrieval for multiple types of databases, including relational, document-based, and graph data sources [19]. However, this approach demands that the agent be equipped with a comprehensive schema, detailed examples, and extensive knowledge of diverse database structures. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies such as slower query generation, token overhead, and a higher likelihood of errors in query formation. Additionally, relying on a single agent to process heterogeneous data increases the risk of misinterpretation, resulting in incorrect or suboptimal queries. These limitations often hinder the scalability and performance of systems operating in diverse data environments.\nThe Multi-Agent [22, 23] RAG system resolves these challenges by delegating tasks to specialized agents, each tailored to handle a specific type of database. For example, a MySQL agent is responsible for generating optimized SQL queries for relational databases [10], while a MongoDB agent specializes in document-based data retrieval. By focusing solely"}, {"title": "2.3 Choice of LLM in RAG", "content": "The choice of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 5, 4, 2] is a crucial consideration in the design and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system's efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models [?] and API-based models [6, 7, 5]. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama [4], operate within an organization's infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.[5, 2].\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT models and Google's Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage. [6, 7]\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques."}, {"title": "2.4 Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent RAG Systems", "content": "Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect of the Multi-Agent RAG System, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the generated queries [16, 17, 18].

It addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as weak reasoning and context handling, by using evidence-based reasoning to guide response generation. This approach simplifies the process by having a single agent retrieve and use relevant evidence for better output. The study shows that single-agent RAG systems can achieve strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, offering a more efficient alternative to multi-agent systems while still delivering high-quality results [3].\nThe Speculative RAG framework enhances single-agent RAG systems by using a two-LM approach for improved efficiency and accuracy. A smaller, distilled specialist LM drafts multiple responses from different document subsets, while a larger generalist LM verifies these drafts in a single pass. This method reduces token use, mitigates position bias, and speeds up processing. Extensive testing on benchmarks such as TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge shows that Speculative RAG boosts accuracy by up to 12.97% and cuts latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems, setting a new standard for single-agent RAG performance [15].\nAlthough pre-trained language models are good at storing knowledge, they have trouble updating and precisely accessing it, particularly when performing knowledge-intensive operations. To overcome this, RAG models integrate non-parametric memory, such as a vector index of Wikipedia, that is retrieved by a neural retriever with pre-trained parametric memory. This method enhances the model's capacity to produce precise and accurate answers. There are two primary RAG approaches: one modifies the retrieved passages per token, while the other uses the same passages throughout the output. Optimized RAG models have demonstrated improved generation quality and factual correctness on open-domain QA tasks, outperforming task-specific architectures and conventional parametric models [3]."}, {"title": "3.2 Multi-Agent Systems in AI", "content": "By focusing on relevant feedback and multi-agent communication patterns, this work examines how large language models (LLMs) might improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for technical support.

However, smaller models, such as Llama3, produced comparable findings when given appropriate prompts. Although they required more computing power, patterns like Reflection and Planning improved accuracy for multi-agent communication by 55% compared to simpler techniques. This study demonstrates how LLMs enhance RAG systems while balancing quality and efficiency [11].\nThe study also examines how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance 6G communication systems while addressing limitations in logic, data protection, and refinement.

This environment serves as a central platform that connects the generated queries with the corresponding databases to retrieve the necessary data. The query execution environment plays a crucial role in ensuring that the queries are executed correctly and efficiently, managing communication between the system and different types of databases.\nThe environment is equipped with database drivers that ensure compatibility with various types of databases. For example, relational databases like MySQL are accessed through JDBC drivers, which handle structured data in tables. For NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, there are MongoDB-specific drivers that handle document-based data, which can be more flexible and hierarchical. Similarly, graph databases like Neo4j require Neo4j drivers, which are specifically designed to query relationships between nodes in a graph structure. Depending on the type of database being queried, the correct driver is chosen to ensure smooth communication and efficient data retrieval.\nThe query execution environment is responsible for managing the database connections, executing the queries generated by the agents, and retrieving the results. The execution function, \\(g_{db}\\), handles the query \\(Q_{generated}\\) and interacts with the target database \\(D_{connection}\\) to return the results \\(R_{query}\\), which are then passed back to the system for further processing.

It retrieves the relevant data in response to the query, ensuring that the returned results are accurate and contextually appropriate.\nAfter retrieving the data, the system combines it with the original query context to prepare it for further processing. This integration step is critical as it provides the generative agent with the necessary information to produce an accurate and coherent response. The retrieved data and the original query context together serve as inputs for the generative phase.\nFinally, the generative agent synthesizes the final response.

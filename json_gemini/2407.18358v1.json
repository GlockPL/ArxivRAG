Data breaches have become a major concern, leading to heightened\npublic awareness about data protection. Individuals, organizations, and society as a whole are now more focused on\nsafeguarding data privacy and security. A prominent example of this is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nintroduced by the European Union. GDPR aims to protect users' personal privacy and data security by mandating clear\nuser agreements and prohibiting misleading practices that could force users to give up their privacy rights. Additionally,\noperators must obtain user consent before training models and users have the right to delete their private data. When\nengaging in data transactions with third parties, it is essential to ensure that the contract clearly defines the scope of\nthe data being exchanged and the data protection responsibilities. These laws and regulations pose new challenges to\ntraditional artificial intelligence data processing methods.\nIn the field of artificial intelligence, data is a fundamental component necessary for model training. However, data often\nexists in isolated clusters, known as data islands. The conventional method to address data islands involves centralizing\nthe data for processing, which includes collecting the data, applying standardized processing techniques, performing\ndata cleaning, and building models. Unfortunately, data leakage often occurs during these collection and processing\nstages. Although regulations have strengthened the protection of users' private information, collecting data for model\ntraining has become more difficult. This has led to a significant focus on finding legal solutions to the problem of data\nislands within the artificial intelligence community.\nFederated learning has opened new research opportunities in artificial intelligence by introducing a novel training\napproach that enables the development of personalized models while preserving user privacy. With the advent of\nartificial intelligence chipsets, client devices now possess enhanced computing capabilities, facilitating the shift of\nartificial intelligence model training from central servers to end-user devices. Federated learning provides a privacy\nprotection mechanism that utilizes the computing resources of end-user devices for model training, thereby preventing\nthe leakage of private information during data transmission. Given the vast number of mobile and other field-specific\ndevices, federated learning can fully exploit a wealth of valuable dataset resources.\nGenerative Al refers to the field of artificial intelligence focused on developing models and algorithms capable of\ncreating new content resembling data from a specific domain. The core concept of generative AI is to train models to\nunderstand the underlying patterns and structures of a dataset and then generate new samples with similar characteristics.\nGenerative models aim to capture the probability distribution of the training data and generate new instances by sampling"}, {"title": "Background", "content": "Federated Learning (FL) has garnered significant interest from researchers aiming to explore its capabilities and\npractical implementations [1]. Traditional centralized methods, which involve collecting and storing customer data in a\ncentral repository, are increasingly seen as impractical due to stringent data privacy regulations [2]. FL is particularly\nadvantageous when dealing with on-device data that is highly sensitive, not easily transferable to servers, or undesirable\nto share for various reasons [3]. In the traditional cloud server model, data from mobile devices is sent and processed\ncentrally, raising privacy concerns among data owners and suffering from significant propagation delays and high\nlatency [4]. These issues have driven the development of new techniques, resulting in the adoption of FL [5].\nImplementing FL in various industries presents several challenges. Collaborative learning, a fundamental aspect of\nFL, involves training algorithms using decentralized data from different devices or servers without sharing the actual\ndata [6]. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional methods, which typically involve uploading data samples to\nservers or storing them in distributed architectures. FL emphasizes stronger modeling without data sharing, leading to\nmore secure solutions with controlled data access privileges [7].\nThe main challenge is training the data without centralizing it. FL addresses this issue by focusing on collaboration,\nwhich is often infeasible with conventional machine learning techniques. Moreover, FL allows algorithms to learn from\nexperiences accumulated across multiple devices, which is not always possible with other ML approaches [8]. Rather\nthan aggregating data from multiple sources or relying heavily on traditional discovery and replication methods, FL\ntrains a shared global model using a central server while keeping the data in its original locations [9].\nThe architecture of an FL server must support communities of varying sizes, from tens to millions of devices, and\nhandle rounds involving several devices up to thousands or even millions of participants [10]. The updates gathered\nand transmitted in each round can range in size from a few kilobytes to tens of megabytes [11]. Additionally, device\nactivity and charging patterns can cause significant variation in the volume of incoming and outgoing traffic in specific\ngeographical regions throughout the day [12].\nFL performs optimally when on-device data is more pertinent than server-stored data, particularly when data privacy is\nparamount or when transferring data to servers is impractical or undesirable [13]."}, {"title": "2.2 Blockchain Federated Learning", "content": "We can conceptualize Federated Learning (FL) clients as the blockchain nodes in a Blockchain-Federated Learning\n(BCFL) system. In this scenario, clients do not only train their local models but also verify updates and generate new\nblocks. Given this BCFL framework, we can deduce that the FL model is decentralized since each blockchain node has\nthe opportunity to engage in local model training and contribute to global model aggregation. Thus, the blockchain\neffectively assumes the role of a central aggregator.\nWithin this setup, there are two approaches for averaging the global model: (a) Selected nodes collect validated local\nmodel updates and execute the aggregation algorithm. (b) All nodes actively participate in the global model aggregation\nprocess.\nThe distributed ledger records the training data, including validated local model updates, global model updates, and\nother pertinent data generated during the learning process. The general workflow of BCFL can be outlined as follows:\nThe clients are tasked with collecting data and training models on their local devices. The local model updates are then\nverified by selected clients. After verification, these updates are gathered by chosen clients to update the global model.\nA new block, containing the verified model updates, is subsequently added to the distributed ledger. In line with the\nincentive mechanism, rewards are distributed to the participants."}, {"title": "2.3 Adaptive Federated Learning", "content": "When dealing with a substantial volume of data required to train a precise model, the federated learning procedure\ncan place a considerable burden on resources. The term \"resources\" encompasses various factors such as time, energy,\nmonetary expenses, and both computational and communication aspects. It is often necessary to impose restrictions on\nthe resources utilized for model training to prevent system congestion and maintain cost-effectiveness. This becomes\nespecially crucial in edge computing settings where computational and communication resources are not as plentiful as\nthose found in data centers."}, {"title": "3 Generative AI", "content": "Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on developing models and algorithms that can create new\ncontent resembling data from a particular domain.

An example scenario involves\nthe periodic transmission of these models to the cloud platforms of their respective manufacturers. As a result, the\nshared generic model receives updates along with updates from other users who own the same device model but live in\ndifferent smart homes. Once the shared generic model is updated, it can be redistributed to each smart device, much\nlike how text prediction models are deployed on smartphones [26]. This process benefits not only the owner of the\nsmart device, whose device improves based on their behavior, but also other users with the same smart device.\nFor instance, consider a situation where a smart doorbell with facial recognition capabilities detects an unfamiliar\nperson approaching the homeowner's residence. The Federated Learning model integrated into the smart home system\nidentifies the individual's presence and generates an alert. At the same time, the generative AI component converts\nthis alert into a courteous audio message, informing the homeowner about the visitor's identity and providing relevant\ndetails based on the facial recognition data. This proactive method enhances both security and convenience for the\nhomeowner, enabling them to make informed decisions about granting access to their home [27].\nHowever, utilizing the federated learning approach in this particular scenario introduces additional network costs.\nSpecifically, when an update is initiated, access to an external network is required. Subsequently, the manufacturer\nsends an update of the shared generic model to the network, which might necessitate user consent before implementing\nthe update on the device. Moreover, the updates need to be exchanged in both directions (i.e., between smart devices\nand clouds), resulting in increased overall costs and potentially occurring more frequently than conventional updates."}, {"title": "5.2 Health Care", "content": "Federated Learning (FL) holds significant promise in the healthcare sector as a groundbreaking approach for safe-\nguarding data privacy.

Each hospital has access to its patient data, but due to privacy regulations and concerns,\nsharing this data directly is not feasible. With FL, instead of sharing raw data, hospitals train local models on their data\nand only share model updates with a centralized server. The server aggregates these updates and computes a global\nmodel, which is then sent back to each hospital for further refinement.

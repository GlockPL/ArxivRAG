Models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5-Pro have demonstrated impressive proficiency on rigorous mathematical benchmarks (Ahn et al., 2024) such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), underscoring the evolving role of LLMs from simple text generators to sophisticated tools capable of engaging with high-level mathematical challenges. Beyond solving student-oriented math problems, leading mathematicians have begun exploring the use of LLMs to assist in tackling unresolved mathematical challenges (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024). Despite these models' success in achieving high accuracy on existing mathematical datasets, their potential for creative problem-solving remains largely underexplored.\nMathematical creativity goes beyond solving problems correctly; it involves generating novel solutions, applying unconventional techniques, and offering deep insights-areas traditionally associated with human ingenuity. Yet, most studies have focused primarily on correctness and efficiency, paying little attention to the innovative approaches LLMs might employ. Furthermore, creativity in mathematical problem-solving is rarely integrated into existing benchmarks, limiting our understanding of LLMs' full potential. The current research landscape lacks a comprehensive framework that evaluates both the accuracy and the creative capacity of LLMs. This gap highlights the need for new methodologies and benchmarks specifically designed to assess and cultivate the creative problem-solving abilities of LLMs in mathematics, which is the focus of this paper.\nWe created the dataset CREATIVEMATH, a comprehensive math benchmark that includes problems from middle school to Olympic-level competitions, each accompanied by multiple high-quality solutions ranging from straightforward to highly innovative approaches. Additionally, we designed a"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "LLMs have demonstrated significant advancements in both mathematical reasoning and creative capabilities, making them increasingly powerful tools in a variety of domains. In the realm of mathematical reasoning, techniques such as prompt engineering, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and program-aided language modeling have notably enhanced LLMs' abilities to solve complex problems (Brown, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023). These approaches enable models to break down problems into more manageable steps, thereby improving their accuracy and reasoning depth. Moreover, specialized models like MathVerse (Zhang et al., 2024) and Internlm-Math (Ying et al., 2024b), which are trained on extensive mathematical corpora, have achieved significant improvements in mathematical problem-solving performance (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Ying et al., 2024b). Benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH further provide a structured means to evaluate and compare these advancements, highlighting the continuous progress in this area (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021b).\nIn terms of creativity, LLMs have shown remarkable prowess across diverse fields. They have excelled in generating high-quality, human-like content, ranging from code generation (Ni et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024a) and music composition (Yuan et al., 2024) to literature (G\u00f3mez-Rodr\u00edguez & Williams, 2023; Liu et al., 2024b) and educational tools (Lan & Chen, 2024; Orenstrakh et al., 2023). Creativity in LLMs is often evaluated using frameworks like Margaret Boden's criteria (Franceschelli & Musolesi, 2023) and the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) (Torrance, 1966), where they have demonstrated high fluency, originality, and flexibility. However, the applicability of these traditional creativity metrics to AI systems is still a topic of debate, as they were originally designed to assess human creativity (Zhao et al., 2024). Techniques such as associative thinking have been employed to enhance the creative output of LLMs further, although challenges remain in ensuring that these models can meaningfully integrate unrelated concepts (Mehrotra et al., 2024). The ethical and legal implications of AI-generated creativity continue to be a significant area of concern, underscoring the need for ongoing research to refine evaluation methods and address societal impacts (Lofstead, 2023)."}, {"title": "3 CREATIVEMATH CURATION", "content": "This section details the creation, collection, and processing of our dataset CreativeMath, which comprises high-quality mathematical problems from various competitions and their numerous solutions.

The methodology is structured into four key stages: Novel Solution Generation, Correctness Evaluation, Coarse-Grained Novelty Assessment, and Fine-Grained Novelty Assessment. This comprehensive pipeline illustrated in Figure 3 ensures that the generated solutions are not only correct but also exhibit a meaningful degree of novelty relative to the reference solutions. The sample prompts and LLMs' responses are provided in the Appendix."}, {"title": "4.1 NOVEL SOLUTION GENERATION", "content": "The first stage of the methodology aims to generate novel solutions for the given mathematical problem using LLM. For each problem, a subset of $k$ reference solutions (where $k$ ranges from 1 to $n$, with $n$ representing the total number of available reference solutions) is sequentially selected based on the order in which competitors uploaded their solutions on the website. Earlier solutions are often the most common and intuitive, while later ones may build on previous methods, offer improvements, or introduce entirely novel algorithms. Consequently, as $k$ increases, the difficulty in generating new and innovative solutions also increases.\nTo ensure clarity and consistency in both prompting and evaluating the novelty of generated solutions, we define a set of criteria agreed upon in consultation with several mathematicians. These criteria guide both the generation and the evaluation process and are used to assess the distinctiveness of the solutions. The criteria are as follows:\n\u2022 Methodological Differences: If the methods used to arrive at the solutions are fundamentally different (e.g., algebraic manipulation versus geometric reasoning), the solutions are considered distinct.\n\u2022 Intermediate Step Variation: Even if the final results are identical, if the intermediate steps or processes involved in reaching those solutions differ significantly, the solutions are considered novel.\n\u2022 Assumptions and Conditions: Solutions that rely on different assumptions, initial conditions, or constraints are treated as distinct.\n\u2022 Generalization: A solution that generalizes to a broader class of problems is considered novel compared to one that is specific to certain conditions.\n\u2022 Complexity: If one solution is notably simpler or more complex than another, they are regarded as different, even if they lead to the same result.\nThese criteria, also illustrated in Figure 4, are embedded into the prompt used to guide the LLM in generating novel solutions. The reference solutions provided to the model aim to capture a variety of approaches, and the LLM is instructed to output a new solution that is distinct according to the defined criteria. The prompt emphasizes generating solutions that use different problem-solving methods, distinct intermediate steps, and variations in assumptions or generalizability.\nAs part of this process, to avoid influencing the judgment of evaluators during the subsequent evaluation stage, transition sentences and justifications explaining why the new solution is distinct from the reference solutions are manually removed. Only the newly generated solution is presented for evaluation."}, {"title": "4.2 CORRECTNESS AND NOVELTY EVALUATION", "content": "To rigorously evaluate the correctness and novelty of the generated solutions, we employ three leading LLMs\u2014GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro\u2014as LLM Evaluators, recognized among the strongest models available. These LLM Evaluators collaboratively assess the solutions following the framework illustrated in Figure 3 (middle). Each LLM Evaluator adheres to the flowchart depicted in Figure 3 (right) to systematically evaluate the generated solutions across three dimensions:\n\u2022 Correctness: The solution must first be validated for correctness, ensuring it produces the correct result for the problem. Only correct solutions proceed to the novelty assessment stages.\n\u2022 Coarse-Grained Novelty: If the solution is correct, it is then evaluated for novelty against a subset of $k$ reference solutions. A solution is deemed novel if it is distinct from these $k$ solutions.\n\u2022 Fine-Grained Novelty: A solution deemed novel in the coarse-grained assessment undergoes further evaluation against the entire set of $n$ human-provided solutions. This stage distinguishes between:\n - Novel-Unknown: A solution that is distinct from all $n$ human-generated solutions, representing a truly original contribution.\n - Novel-Known: A solution that is distinct from the $k$ reference solutions but similar to others in the remaining $n - k$ solutions."}, {"title": "4.2.1 EVALUATION STRATEGY", "content": "We apply different strategies for correctness and novelty evaluation to ensure both rigor and practicality.

The newly generated solution, along with the original problem and a set of reference solutions, is evaluated by the LLM Evaluators using the prompt shown in Figure 5, top.

For each competition, 50 samples were randomly chosen to ensure a representative evaluation of the LLMs' performance. The datasets were meticulously curated to ensure that when the problem and all reference solutions were included in the novel solution generation prompt, the total token count did not exceed 3K tokens. This approach allowed for 1K tokens to be reserved for generation, accommodating the token limits of models like DeepSeek-Math-7B-RL, which has a 4K-token capacity.

To ensure reproducibility, all experiments were conducted using the greedy decoding strategy, adhering to the recommended settings provided on the official Hugging Face pages or the models' respective papers. The system prompt followed the guidelines outlined in the models' documentation, with the maximum number of new tokens set to 1024. This standardized approach ensures consistent and reliable evaluation across all models used in our study."}, {"title": "5.4 EVALUATION METRICS", "content": "To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating novel solutions, we define several evaluation metrics, as outlined in Table 1. These metrics capture key aspects of the solutions, including correctness, different levels of novelty, and the relationship between novelty and correctness. Importantly, novelty is only considered if the solution is correct, and the Correctness Ratio, Novelty Ratio, and Novel-Unknown Ratio are calculated based on all generated solutions to ensure a consistent evaluation."}, {"title": "5.5 RESULTS & DISCUSSIONS", "content": "We introduce our results in the context of each of our four research questions and discuss our main findings.\nQ1: Given a math problem with $n$ known solutions, and an LLM provided with the problem along with $k$ of those solutions, how effectively can the LLM generate a novel solution?\nAnalysis of Coarse-Grained Novelty Table 2 demonstrates the superior performance of Gemini-1.5-Pro across all evaluated metrics, particularly in its ability to generate novel solutions. With a Novelty Ratio ($N$) of 66.94% and a Correctness Ratio ($C$) of 69.92%, Gemini-1.5-Pro not only generates a high number of correct solutions but also ensures that most of these are novel. The model's Novelty-to-Correctness Ratio ($N/C$) of 95.75% indicates that nearly all correct solutions it produces are distinct from the provided reference solutions.\nLlama-3-70B and Claude-3-Opus also perform well in terms of $N$, with Llama-3-70B achieving a noteworthy $N/C$ of 82.87%. This contrasts sharply with models like GPT-4O, DeepSeek-V2, and Mixtral-8x22B, which, despite similar $C$ values, have $N/C$ ratios below 50%. This discrepancy highlights significant differences in the ability of LLMs to generate novel solutions, even when their correctness levels are comparable. Notably, Llama-3-70B outperforms closed-source models Claude-3-Opus and GPT-4O, suggesting that open-source LLMs can achieve competitive novelty generation capabilities.\nIn contrast, smaller models like Yi-1.5-34B and specialized math-tuned models such as Deepseek-Math-7B-RL and Internlm2-Math-20B exhibit lower $C$ and $N/C$ ratios. This outcome is consistent with scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020), where large models generally outperform compared to small ones. The low $N/C$ in these math-specialized models suggests that their fine-tuning for mathe-\nQ2: How does the number of provided solutions, $k$, affect the LLM's performance in generating new solutions?\nImpact of $k$ on Correctness This section examines how increasing the number of provided reference solutions ($k$) affects the correctness of generated solutions, as shown in Table 3. Across most models, there is a clear trend of improved correctness with larger $k$ values. For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro reaches 100% correctness at $k = 4$, demonstrating its ability to effectively utilize additional examples. This trend is consistent with findings in few-shot learning, where more examples typically lead to better model performance (Brown, 2020). Models like Llama-3-70B and DeepSeek-V2 show moderate improvements with increased $k$, though the gains are less pronounced compared to Gemini-1.5-Pro. In contrast, models like Qwen1.5-72B and Yi-1.5-34B show minimal increases in correctness, potentially due to variability introduced by smaller sample sizes at higher $k$ values.\nImpact of the Degree of Solution Availability ($n \u2212 k$) on Novelty The degree of solution availability, denoted by $n - k$, represents the gap between the total available solutions and those provided"}, {"title": "Q3: How does the creativity of LLMs vary when solving math problems of varying difficulty levels?", "content": "We analyzed the correctness ($C$) and Novelty-to-Correctness Ratio ($N/C$) of all LLMs across competitions of different difficulty levels, focusing on problems where $k = 1$ to ensure consistency. As shown in Table 5, as problem difficulty increases, the correctness of LLMs consistently decreases, dropping from 71.80% on AMC 8 problems to around 35% on more challenging competitions like USAMO and IMO. Conversely, the $N/C$ ratio increases with difficulty, from 55.39% on easier problems to 83.01% on the most difficult ones. This suggests that while LLMs struggle with accuracy on harder problems, they are more likely to generate novel solutions when they do succeed. The observed trend indicates a shift in the balance between familiarity and innovation: as problem difficulty rises, LLMs are pushed to rely less on familiar strategies and more on creative problem-solving. This complex interplay between familiarity and innovation becomes more pronounced with increasing problem difficulty, leading to a higher likelihood of novel solutions."}, {"title": "Q4: When different LLMs are given the same math problem and k solutions, how likely are the new solutions generated by these LLMs to be identical or distinct?

The prompts were crafted to test various aspects of the models' reasoning processes, including correctness and novelty. Below is a detailed description of the prompts used and the corresponding responses from different LLMs.\nA.1.1 PROMPT 1. NOVEL SOLUTION GENERATION\nTask: The LLM is provided with a mathematical problem and a set of reference solutions. The task is to generate a new, distinct solution that is novel compared to the given reference solutions.\nBelow is the prompt for generating a novel solution for an AMC 8 problem with $k = 4$ reference solutions. Typically, the subsequent solutions may be modifications of the previous ones; for example, solution 2 is a slightly different version of solution 1.\nCriteria for evaluating the difference between two mathematical solutions include:\ni). If the methods used to arrive at the solutions are fundamentally different, such as algebraic manipulation versus geometric reasoning, they can be considered distinct;\nii). Even if the final results are the same, if the intermediate steps or processes involved in reaching those solutions vary significantly, the solutions can be considered different;\niii). If two solutions rely on different assumptions or conditions, they are likely to be distinct;\niv). A solution might generalize to a broader class of problems, while another solution might be specific to certain conditions. In such cases, they are considered distinct; v). If one solution is significantly simpler or more complex than the other, they can be regarded as essentially different, even if they lead to the same result.\nGiven the following mathematical problem:\nWhat is the largest power of 2 that is a divisor of $13^4 \u2013 11^4$?\n(A) 8 (B) 16 (C) 32 (D) 64 (E) 128\nAnd some typical solutions:\nSolution 1:\nFirst, we use difference of squares on $13^4 \u2013 11^4 = (13^2)^2 - (11^2)^2$ to get $13^4 \u2013 11^4 = (13^2 + 11^2)(13^2 \u2013 11^2)$. Using difference of squares again and simplifying, we get (169 + 121)(13 + 11)(13 - 11) = 290.24.2 = (2.8.2).(3.145). Realizing that we don't need the right-hand side because it doesn't contain any factor of 2, we see that the greatest power of 2 that is a divisor $13^4 \u2013 11^4$ is (C) 32\nSolution 2:\nJust like in the above solution, we use the difference-of-squares factorization, but only once to get $13^4 \u2013 11^4 = (13^2 \u2013 11^2)(13^2 + 11^2)$. We can then compute that this is equal to 48 \u00b7 290. Note that 290 = 2 145 (we don't need to factorize any further as 145 is already odd) thus the largest power of 2 that divides 290 is only $2^1 = 2$, while 48 = $2^4$. 3, so the largest power of 2 that divides 48 is $2^4 = 16$. Hence, the largest power of 2 that is a divisor of $13^4 - 11^4$ is 2\u00b716 = (C) 32\nSolution 3:\nLet $n = 13^4 \u2013 11^4$. We wish to find the largest power of 2 that divides $n$.\nDenote $v_p(k)$ as the largest exponent of $p$ in the prime factorization of $n$. In this problem, we have $p = 2$.\nBy the Lifting the Exponent Lemma on $n$,\n$v_2(13^4 \u2013 11^4) = v_2(13 \u2013 11) + v_2(4) + v_2(13 + 11) \u2013 1$\n$= v_2(2) + v_2(4) + v_2(24) \u2013 1$\n= 1 + 2 + 3 \u2013 1 = 5$.\nTherefore, exponent of the largest power of 2 that divids $13^4 \u2013 11^4$ is 5, so the largest power of 2 that divides this number is $2^5$ (C)32"}, {"title": "A.1.2 PROMPT 2.

Hence, the largest power of 2 that is a divisor of $13^4 - 11^4$ is 2\u00b716 = (C) 32\nNew solution:\nWe can rewrite the expression $13^4 \u2013 11^4$ as $(13^2)^2 \u2013 (11^2)^2$.

We know that $13^4 \u2013 11^4 = (13^2 + 11^2)(24\u00b72)$, and since $13^2 + 11^2$ is not divisible by 2, the largest power of 2 that divides $13^4 \u2013 11^4$ is the same as the largest power of 2 that divides 24. 2, which is $2^3.2^1 = 2^4 = 16$.\nBut we are not done yet. Notice that 24.2 = 48, and 48 is divisible by $2^4 = 16$. Therefore, the largest power of 2 that divides $13^4 \u2013 11^4$ is $2^4 = 16$.\nHowever, we need to consider that the question asks for the largest power of 2 that is a divisor, not just any power of 2. Since 16 is a divisor of 48, and 48 is a divisor of $13^4 \u2013 11^4$, the largest power of 2 that is a divisor of $13^4 - 11^4$ is $2^4 = 16$.\nBut we are still not done.

This falls under 'Analytical\nAI,' traditionally known as AI. However, human intelligence extends to creativity, which machines were once unable to\nreplicate. The advent of 'Generative AI' marks a significant shift, with machines now generating novel and aesthetically\npleasing creations, surpassing mere analysis.\nGenerative AI is rapidly evolving, becoming more efficient and cost-effective, and, in some cases, surpassing human\ncreativity. Its influence spans industries from social media to sales, transforming processes once solely reliant on human\ncreativity. This could significantly reduce the marginal cost of creative and knowledge work, leading to gains in labor\nproductivity and economic value. GAI has the potential to impact billions of workers, enhancing their efficiency and\ncreativity by at least 10%, generating trillions of dollars in economic value.\nThe evolution of RNN networks dates back to 1982 with the Hopfield network proposed by Hopfield [10], a type of\nrecurrent neural network. Later, Michael Jordan proposed the Jordan network in 1986 [11], which was further innovated\nby Jeff Elman to create the Elman network [12], known as the RNN network today. To address issues in long sequence\ntraining, Sepp Hochreiter and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber proposed the LSTM network in 1997 [13]. In 2014, the Google team\nintroduced the Attention mechanism, first used in the seq2seq model. In 2017, they proposed the Transformer model,\nintroducing Multi-Head Self Attention and positional coding. In 2018, the Google team proposed the Bert pre-training\nmodel for natural language processing tasks. In 2019, OpenAI introduced the GPT-2 model, which has since iterated\nto GPT-4. This journey has seen rapid growth in model parameters and training data, with the\nintroduction of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) adding another stage to this development.

These models encompass\ninstructional methods and techniques, instructional planning and assistance, material generation, and environmental\narchitecture."}, {"title": "3.1 Assisting in Generating Learning Strategies", "content": "Since 1987, the field of education has been exploring how to teach students to learn[14]. From the Latin School\nMovements[15] to the massive Head Start Program[16], researchers have been dedicated to the exploration and\ndevelopment of learning strategies. Learning strategies can be defined as behaviors that learners aim to influence the\nway they process information[17]. For example, emphasizing key ideas in an article, summarizing opinions of a lecture,\nor attempting to articulate newly learned information in one's own words.\nThe use of question prompts as a learning strategy plays a guiding role throughout the problem-solving process for\nstudents[18]. This form of questioning, recognized as an effective scaffolding strategy[19], holds great value in\nsupporting student thinking and is widely employed in high-quality mathematics instruction[20]. The emergence\nof GAI has brought about significant changes to the research on question prompts, such as Socratic questioning\nlearning. Socratic questioning is a teaching method that promotes deep learning by guiding students to think and\nexplore[21, 22]. Traditionally, this requires teachers to actively ask questions and interact with students in the classroom.\nHowever, GAI can simulate the process of Socratic questioning by automatically generating targeted questions based\non students' responses and performance, prompting them to engage in deeper thinking and analysis. This personalized\nquestioning approach can help students actively participate in learning, enhancing their understanding of learning\ncontent and critical thinking skills[19]. In a recent study, researchers explored using large language models to generate\nSocratic-style mathematical question-answering[23, 24]. They emphasized the importance of questions being Focused\nand Goal-driven, targeting key knowledge in specific domains to help students achieve learning goals[18, 25].\nOn the other hand, GAI excels in programming education by providing personalized exercises and project tasks based\non students' coding proficiency and knowledge levels. It integrates theory with practical application, helping students\nmaster programming languages, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Acting as a programming tutor, GAI\noffers real-time suggestions, analyzes code, and provides targeted recommendations for optimization.\nSpecifically, the strategies for programming education are consistent with those of other subjects. Programming courses\nand assignments typically progress in complexity, gradually introducing new concepts while ensuring that students\nare not overwhelmed, thus avoiding cognitive overload[26] and fostering students' proximal development[27]. The"}, {"title": "3.2 Planning Personalized Learning Path", "content": "The learning path is the implementation of learning strategies. It consists of a set of learning activities that help users\nachieve specific learning goals. Personalizing pathways has become an important task due to differences in users'\nlimitations, backgrounds, and goals[39]. Technology and instructional innovation are redefining education. The core\nof this integration is e-learning. Nowadays, using electronic learning systems such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems\n(ITS) has become commonplace[40]. These systems aim to provide educational resources to users[41]. They have\nseveral advantages compared to traditional learning methods, where the teacher plays a major role and controls the\nclassroom. The main advantages include availability[42], cost reduction [43], improved collaboration[42], enhanced\nflexibility (students can learn at their convenience), etc[44]. With the emergence of GAI, there have been new methods\nfor learning pathway generation.\nIn ITS, prompts are a common form of instructional guidance or planning. Generative models have greatly improved\nthe personalization and accuracy of prompts. In [45], learning guidance and planning are carried out in the Korbit\nITS using three steps: keyword recognition, determining sentence spans, and generating prompts through embedded\nlanguage model technology. Additionally, during the generation step, the model incorporates explanations based\non Wikipedia to help students better understand and remember concepts effectively. Empirical research has shown that\npersonalized prompt generation significantly improves students' performance, while explanations based on Wikipedia\nprovide valuable learning feedback.\nOn the other hand, research has found that structuring learning experiences in the form of interactive \"narratives\" or\n\"stories\" told by the learning environment can enhance learner engagement[46, 47]. Making the learning approach more\ninteractive and aligning learning path presentation with typical narrative structures can expedite students' achievement of\nlearning goals[48]. In[48], an AI-based approach was proposed to automatically generate learning content and integrate\nit into the appropriate positions within the learning path. In other words, the interactive narrative sequences\nthat conform to general narrative expectations are constructed by intertwining the learning path with the automatically\ngenerated learning content referred to as narrative fragments. The method proposed in this study constructs this\ninteractive narrative in a domain-agnostic manner[48]. It can generate narrative fragments for learning resources\nin any format, unlike many AI-based learning environments that accept only specific formats of learning sources.\nThough narrative fragments can be created manually, they would cost a large amount of time and effort. Additionally,\nAI-based learning content generation methods can achieve adaptive learning by dynamically generating content based\non learner-driven variations. Ultimately, the model built using GPT-2[23] has shown excellent results in empirical\nresearch."}, {"title": "3.3 Generating Subject Teaching Materials", "content": "Teaching materials form the cornerstone of a seamless learning journey, encompassing a range of resources utilized\nfor educational and instructional purposes. These resources include, but are not limited to, books, textbooks, teaching\naids, slides, laboratory equipment, and multimedia materials. The primary objective of teaching materials is to impart\nessential knowledge, concepts, skills, and understanding, thereby facilitating student learning and development. Given\nthe unique characteristics of each academic discipline, teaching materials exhibit significant variation across different\nsubjects. In fields like mathematics and science, where materials are both abundant and complex, the integration of\nmachine assistance is imperative to reduce the human workload. The specific supported methods are shown.\nIn an experimental study, Bezirhan and Von Davier[49] explored the application of OpenAI's advanced language model,\nGPT-3, in the automatic generation of reading materials. The study entailed a comparative evaluation of the quality of\ntexts generated by GPT-3 against original reading materials, supplemented by minor edits from human editors. This\ndomain poses considerable challenges and has garnered considerable attention, with numerous cutting-edge studies\nfocusing on automated content generation in educational materials. Consequently, this has become a focal point of\ncurrent research and a challenging area of study. Many cutting-edge investigations are specifically focused on this\naspect. To be more specific:\n\u2022 Mathematics: Teaching materials in mathematics cover knowledge in areas such as numbers and operations,\nalgebra, geometry, probability, and statistics. These materials help students develop logical thinking, problem-\nsolving, and reasoning abilities;\n\u2022 Science: Teaching materials in science encompass knowledge in fields such as physics, chemistry, biology,\nand other natural sciences. They explore natural phenomena, scientific principles, and experimental methods,\nfostering students' observation, experimentation, and reasoning abilities;\nMathematics: In the field of mathematics, a study conducted by Frieder et al. [50] indicates that ChatGPT's mathematical\nabilities are inferior to those of graduate students in mathematics departments. It has been observed that its accuracy in\nsolving mathematical word problems (MWP) varies with task complexity[51]. In the process of learning mathematics,\ncombining assessment research and the findings summarized in by Wardat et al. [52], it can be identified that generative\nmodels can produce various types of mathematical instructional materials, including:\n(i) Personalized hints for mathematical solutions\n(ii) Practice exercises for mathematical problems\n(iii) Step-by-step analysis of mathematical problem-solving processes\nThese three types of content can respectively serve the processes of teaching, assessing, and learning. However, like all\nGPT models, including ChatGPT, there is a possibility of misconceptions when solving problems. This is because these\nmodels are trained on large text corpora that contain both correct and incorrect information. Additionally, GPT models\nlack human-like reasoning and comprehension abilities, which can sometimes lead to errors or misunderstandings."}, {"title": "3.4 Creating Efficient Learning Environment", "content": "Generally speaking, intelligent learning environments are considered effective, efficient, and engaging [57], with\nlearners at their core.

Intelligent learning environments enable\naccess to resources and interactions anytime, anywhere, providing instructional guidance and support tools when needed\n[60]. They support learners' and educators' planning and innovative approaches, embodying effectiveness, efficiency,\nengagement, flexibility, adaptability, and reflectiveness [61].\nWith the advent of GAI, learning environments can become more intelligent, enabling discussions, interactions,\ntutoring, and other teaching activities anytime, anywhere. They can generate targeted learning tasks [53], provide\nintelligent assistance for experiments [55], help solve problems step by step through Socratic questioning [62], and\nexplore root causes for unresolved problems [35]. GAI enriches teaching methods and establishes a more efficient\nlearning environment. Additionally, it can enhance learning objectives by combining Bloom's taxonomy and GAI to\nformulate instructional objectives [63]. Research on intelligent educational materials has contributed to smart learning\nenvironments. Traditional materials may not effectively convey complex information [64]. Augmenting textbooks with\nautomated annotations and relevant videos [65], transforming e-books into interactive editions [66], generating guiding\nquestions [67], and quizzes [68] promote active learning and faster feedback. An immersive and interactive learning\nenvironment can enhance learning performance. GAI in constructing metaverse scenarios can help engineers rapidly\ncreate complex structures [69].

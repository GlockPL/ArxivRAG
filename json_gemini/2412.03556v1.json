Without adequate guardrails, more capable systems could be\nused to commit cybercrime, build biological weapons, or spread harmful misinformation, among\nother threats. Jailbreaks, which are model\ninputs designed to circumvent safety measures, can carry substantial consequences. Therefore, rigorously evaluating\nmodel safeguards is critical, motivating a search for automated red-teaming methods that seamlessly\napply to multiple input modalities.\nIn this work, we introduce Best-of-N (BON) Jailbreaking\u00b9, a simple, scalable black-box automated\nred-teaming method that supports multiple modalities. BoN Jailbreaking repeatedly samples\naugmentations to prompts until one produces a harmful response (Fig. 1, top). The algorithm is\nentirely black-box and multi-modal, thus allowing adversaries to exploit and defenders to assess\nvulnerabilities in the expanded attack surface of new modalities. Importantly, BoN is simple: augmen-\ntations are straightforward perturbations of requests, the method does not need access to logprobs or\ngradients, and it is fast to implement.\nFirst, we demonstrate that BoN Jailbreaking is an effective attack on frontier LLMs\u2014applying\nBoN on text inputs with 10,000 augmented samples achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 78% on"}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "We now introduce Best-of-N Jailbreaking (BoN; Fig. 1), an effective black-box jailbreaking algorithm\nthat makes the same harmful request in many different ways until one bypasses model safeguards.\nAlgorithm Details BON Jailbreaking works by applying multiple modality-specific augmentations\nto harmful requests, ensuring that they remain intelligible and the original intent is recognizable.\nExample augmentations are random capitalization for text inputs, different backgrounds for images,\nand pitch modification for audio inputs (full set illustrated in Fig. 2 and described in Appendix A).\nWe apply combinations of different augmentations to each request, generate an output from the\ntarget LLM given the augmented input, and classify the harmfulness of the output using GPT-40 and\nthe HarmBench grader prompt (Fig. 1, top). For each request, we repeat this process by sampling\ndifferent augmentations until the target model produces a harmful response or we reach a predefined\nmaximum number of augmentation samples, N. We include additional stopping criteria detailed in\nAppendix B.1 to reduce the chance of terminating on classifier false positives.\nAttack Success Rate Across all experiments, we use ASR to assess the effectiveness of BoN\nin jailbreaking models using text, vision, and audio inputs. We use 159 direct requests from the\n\"standard\" HarmBench test dataset that exclude copyright and contextual\nbehaviors. These requests include examples such as \"Give detailed instructions for how to safely\nmanufacture and store chlorine gas at home\". We measure ASR across the set of harmful requests as\na function of N. Given recent work highlighting concerns\naround using imperfect classifiers, particularly with repeated sampling, we manually review all\noutputs flagged as potential jailbreaks. We consider a jailbreak successful if it provides the user with\ninformation relevant to the harmful request, even if it is not complete and comprehensive. Most\nsuccessful jailbreaks are comprehensive and egregious, but we choose to do this because even small\nharmful snippets can be exploited for future misuse.\nBootstrapping To understand how the algorithm's performance varies with N, we estimate ex-\npected ASR across multiple possible trajectories of sampled augmentations. Rather than run BoN\nmany times, which would be computationally expensive, we use bootstrap resampling to simulate independent\ntrajectories and estimate error efficiently. For a given N, we independently\nsample without replacement from the observed trajectory of jailbreak success/failure for each request,\nterminating the sampling process when a successful jailbreak occurs. Our results should thus be\ninterpreted as the expected ASR averaged over multiple trajectories rather than the observed ASR of\none trajectory. Throughout our work, we plot the mean ASR after generating 100 trajectories and use\nthe standard deviation for error bars."}, {"title": "JAILBREAKING ACROSS MODALITIES", "content": "We now measure how well BoN Jailbreaking works across text, vision, and audio domains and find it\ncan achieve 70% ASR averaged across models and modalities, including notably robust models.\nTEXT LANGUAGE MODELS\nExperiment Details We apply BoN to frontier models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Claude Son-\nnet), Claude 3 Opus (Claude Opus) , GPT-40, GPT-40-mini , Gemini-1.5-Flash-001 (Gemini Flash), Gemini-1.5-Pro-001 (Gemini Pro)  and\nLlama 3 8B. We also evaluate circuit breaking , an open-source\ndefense using Llama-3-8B-Instruct-RR and GraySwan's Cygnet API. We use three text augmenta-\ntions, namely, character scrambling, random capitalization, and character noising (Fig. 2, top left;\nAppendix A.1) with N = 10,000 and sampling temperature = 1. False positives are reclassified after\nmanual human grading (see examples in Appendix E.1).\nResults We find that BoN achieves ASRs over 50% on all eight models using N = 10,000 (Fig. 1,\nleft). ASRs on Claude Sonnet and Gemini Pro are 78% and 50%, respectively. Asking the model\nonce using unaugmented requests results in significantly lower ASRs of 0.6% on Sonnet and 0% on\nGemini Pro, showing that BoN Jailbreaking is a powerful approach for eliciting egregious responses\n(see examples in Appendix E.2).\nWhile we sample 10,000 augmentations, most successful jailbreaks require far fewer augmentations\n(Fig. 1). Indeed, 53%-71% of the jailbreaks using N = 10,000 on Claude and GPT models and\n22%-30% on Gemini models occur after sampling only 100 augmented attacks. Further, it only costs\n$9 to run BoN with N = 100 on GPT-40, which achieves 50% ASR (see Appendix C.1 for full cost\nanalysis on all models). Thus, BoN is still very effective for more compute-constrained adversaries.\nNotably, we break Llama-3-8B-Instruct-RR denoted \"Circuit Breaking\" in Fig. 1\u2014 with 52% ASR.\nWhile this model is more robust than Llama3.1 8B, which BoN jailbreaks with 94% ASR, these results\ndemonstrate that our attack significantly compromises strong defenses. We also attack Cygnet and\nfind if we tune the system prompt (see Appendix C.2), we can achieve 67% ASR (Fig. 11).

The Realtime API\nreturns text and synthesized speech, and we use the text output for jailbreak classification. To apply\nBON Jailbreaking on ALMs, we vocalize the 159 HarmBench direct requests using human voices\u00b3.\nWe combine six augmentation types to the audio waveform and apply them in this order [speed,\npitch, speech, noise, volume, music] (Fig. 2, bottom left; Appendix A.3).

We model the observed ASR, which reveals power-law-like scaling behavior and\nallows us to forecast the performance of our attack using 10x fewer samples.\nPOWER LAW FITTING\nExperiment Details The scaling behavior in Fig. 1 (d) suggests we can fit a power law\n\u2212log(ASR) = aN\u2212b to the observed ASR since the trend is linear in log-log space.

Using the same setup as\nSection 3, we rerun BoN across models and modalities but use temperature 0 instead of 1.\nResults While applying BoN with temperature 1 is more effective than temperature 0, the perfor-\nmance difference is surprisingly small-ranging from a 0.7% drop in ASR for Claude Opus to a 27.7%\ndrop for Gemini Pro on text models (Fig. 6). This implies that while higher temperatures enhance\nBoN's efficacy through greater output entropy, the substantial variance from input augmentations\nallows BoN to be performative even at temperature 0. We observe this pattern consistently across\ntext and image modalities. There is a larger difference for audio (Fig. 6, right). We hypothesize this\nmay be due to significant filtering of ALM inputs (Appendix D.1.1), which could blunt the impact of\naugmentations and thus make increased entropy from higher temperatures more critical."}, {"title": "ARE THERE PATTERNS IN SUCCESSFUL BON JAILBREAKS?", "content": "Experiment Details To understand BoN attacks, we examine whether successful attempts exhibit\ncommon patterns or relationships to the content of harmful requests.

We analyze the descriptions to understand if there are any significant dif-\nferences between the two groups.

To reduce this sample burden, we investigate combining BoN with other\njailbreak techniques and find this strategy improves its effectiveness significantly.\nExperiment Details We focus on prefix jailbreaks designed to remove alignment safeguards when\ncombined with a harmful request. These prefixes are optimized for universality so that the same one\ncan jailbreak many requests. In our study, we use two techniques to generate prefixes.\nWe introduce Prefix PAIR (PrePAIR), which extends the PAIR algorithm by\nediting a prefix rather than the entire request and optimizing the prefix to jailbreak many different\nrequests. Specifically, PrePAIR iteratively calls GPT-40 to generate prefixes that the algorithm then\napplies to a batch of four harmful requests. The target model then processes these requests with\nthe proposed prefix. The same GPT-40 classifier used in BoN assesses jailbreak success using the\nmodified requests. If all batch requests produce harmful responses, the process terminates and saves\nthe prefix. Otherwise, GPT-40 continues to refine the prefix, utilizing the previous attempts within\nits context window for up to 30 iterations. For audio prefixes, we use text-to-speech to vocalize and prepend them to audio requests. For the vision modality, the text rendered in\nthe image is the original request with an optimized prefix (Fig. 10). See Appendix B.2 for further\nimplementation details and Appendix D.7 in-depth analysis on PrePAIR for ALMs.\nWe find PrePAIR for text inputs does not work on Claude models, so we use many-shot jailbreaking\ninstead.

We only run the reliability experiments with\ntemperature 1 for all the VLMs.\nResults For text models, all models demonstrate higher reliability with temperature 0 than tem-\nperature 1 (Fig. 16). Further, Claude models generally appear to achieve the highest reliability. For\nvision models, we observe more left-skewed reliability distributions; there are few prompts across\nmodels that achieve 100% reliability Fig. 17.

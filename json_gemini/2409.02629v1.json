It is the first toolkit that supports both CLI and API interfaces and external YAML configuration files to enhance versatility and reproducibility. The toolkit includes multiple attacks, defenses and evaluation metrics. Rigiorous software engineering practices are followed to ensure high code quality and maintainability.

However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks - subtle input modifications that can deceive the models (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2013), which can compromise their in-tegrity, confidentiality, or availability (Khalid et al., 2020).\nSeveral libraries, such as ART (Nicolae et al., 2018), AdverTorch (Ding et al., 2019), and CleverHans (Papernot et al., 2018), have been developed to research these vulnerabilities by providing tools for implementing attacks, defenses, and evaluation metrics. However, these libraries often lack key features necessary for comprehensive research and experimentation, such as native multi-GPU support, integrated CLI and API interfaces, and support for external configuration files.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce AdvSecureNet (Adversarial Secure Net-works), a comprehensive and flexible Python toolkit that supports multiple adversarial attacks, defenses, and evaluation metrics, optimized for multi-GPU setups. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) and an application programming interface (API), provid-ing users with versatile options for experimentation and research.

AdvSe-cureNet also includes defense mechanisms such as adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Kurakin et al., 2018), which incorporates adversarial examples into the training pro-cess to enhance model resilience, and ensemble adversarial training (Tram\u00e8r et al., 2018), which leverages multiple models or attacks to develop a more resilient defense strategy.\nEvaluation Metrics: AdvSecureNet supports metrics like accuracy, robustness, trans-ferability, and similarity. Accuracy measures performance on benign data, robustness as-sesses resistance to attacks, transferability evaluates how well adversarial examples deceive different models, and similarity quantifies perceptual differences using PSNR (Hore and Ziou, 2010) and SSIM (Wang et al., 2004).\nMulti-GPU Support: AdvSecureNet is optimized for multi-GPU setup, enhancing the efficiency of training, evaluation, and adversarial attack generation, especially for large models and datasets. This parallel GPU utilization aims to reduce computational time, making the toolkit ideal for large-scale experiments.\nInterfaces and Configuration: AdvSecureNet offers both CLI and API interfaces. The CLI allows for quick execution of attacks, defenses, and evaluations, while the API provides advanced integration and extension within user applications. The toolkit also supports YAML configuration files for easy parameter tuning and experimentation, enabling users to share experiments, reproduce results, and manage setups effectively.\nBuilt-in Models, Datasets and Target Generation: AdvSecureNet supports all PyTorch vision library models and well-known datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, and ImageNet, allowing users to start without additional setup.

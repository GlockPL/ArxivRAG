These models exhibit an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like language, process visual and auditory information, and interpret 3D spatial environments (Zhao et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2023; Engel et al., 2023). However, as we push the boundaries of AI, a new frontier emerges: Temporal Computing-the understanding and utilization of time to construct contextual memory that enhances human cognition. This evolution has paved the way for devices that are not only intelligent but also temporally aware, deeply personalized, and seamlessly integrated into our daily lives.\nAs technology becomes an extension of ourselves, there is a growing demand for AI devices that comprehend and adapt to individual user contexts over time. By leveraging contextual memory, these personalized, temporally-aware, and human-oriented AI devices promise to elevate our interaction with the digital world. They provide intuitive, natural, and efficient user experiences by anticipating needs, understanding preferences, and offering timely assistance without being intrusive, fundamentally enhancing the way we live and work.\nIn response to this demand, we introduce Lucia, an open-source, publicly available Temporal Computing Platform designed to enhance human cognition through contextual memory. This novel portable device effortlessly attaches to users, efficiently recording their daily activities over time. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the device captures long-term activities, creating a rich temporal contextual memory that users can query at any time. Acting as an intelligent assistant or companion, it not only answers queries regarding stored experiences but also understands temporal patterns, thereby augmenting memory recall, enhancing decision-making, and boosting personal productivity.\nLucia builds upon the concepts introduced by Project Aria (Engel et al., 2023), Meta's all-day wearable AR glasses developed as data collection tools for spatial computing. While Project Aria aims to shift computing paradigms by blending digital interactions into the 3D world through spatial computing, Lucia extends these ideas by emphasizing the temporal dimension. It prioritizes the continuous capture and intelligent interpretation of user activities over time while enhancing practical usability: Lucia creates a device that not only records but also understands and provides insightful responses based on the user's temporal experiences."}, {"title": "2 Lucia", "content": "riences. By harnessing the power of modern AI models and Temporal Computing principles, it creates a device that not only records but also understands and provides insightful responses based on the user's temporal experiences. Moreover, unlike many devices that require frequent battery changes or tethering to external power packs for continuous operation, Lucia serves users all day without such inconveniences, offering a seamless and unobtrusive user experience.\nTo further illustrate the unique advantages of Lucia as an all-day wearable perceptual computer, we compare it with existing devices in the market in Fig. 2. In this comparison, we focus on two key hardware aspects: all-day wearability and all-day perceptual capability. All-day wearability refers to the comfort and unobtrusiveness of a device for continuous, all-day use without the user sensing its presence and without the need for frequent charging. All-day perceptual capability measures a device's ability to continuously record and process data throughout the day, assuming that wired charging or battery replacement is available. Note that this comparison focuses solely on the hardware capabilities of these devices, excluding the assessment of their AI functionalities.\nMany current devices either excel in wearability or perceptual capabilities but rarely both, and often lack the capacity for real-time data access essential for Temporal Computing. Lucia uniquely combines high all-day wearability and high all-day perceptual capability, along with direct real-time access to recorded data, positioning it at the forefront of Temporal Computing devices.\nThis technical report demonstrates the necessity and efficacy of our new device, exploring its design principles, functionality, and the significant impact it holds for the future of human-computer interaction. By enhancing human cognition through contextual memory, we offer a step towards a more interconnected and intelligent way of living. We have made these resources available to research institutions around the world to foster advancements in the field of personalized AI.

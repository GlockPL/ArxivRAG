According to this principle, any conclusion can be derived from a contradiction, which makes inconsistent belief bases non informative. This issue is critical in real-world applications, where inconsistencies often arise from various factors including noisy data, vagueness, context dependency, uncertainty, and information from multiple sources. This situation shows the need for analytical tools that can identify the causes of conflicts, ensure recovery of consistency, and enable reasoning under inconsistency. Key approaches for addressing this issue include paraconsistency [19,16], argumentation [6], belief revision [8], and inconsistency measurement [9,20].\n* This paper is an expanded version of an article accepted for publication in AAAI 2025."}, {"title": "2", "content": "D. Crowley et al.\nWhen exploring syntactic\u00b9 approaches to reasoning under inconsistency, two core concepts are frequently used: minimal inconsistent subsets (MISes) and maximal consistent subsets (MCSes). An example of this is the inference relation proposed by Rescher and Manor, which determines conclusions from formulas entailed by all MCSes [18]. A number of additional MCS-based inference relations have been proposed in the literature [7,2,3,10]. The fundamental principle behind using MCSes is to minimize alterations to the available information.\nA significant limitation of using MISes and MCSes, however, lies in their inability to account for the specific syntactic representation of each formula: they do not look inside the formulas. For instance, a MIS maintains its status when any formula within it is replaced by an equivalent one. This drawback limits the ability to identify critical syntactic details, particularly when conflicts stem from factors such as imprecision or encoding errors. This issue is notably highlighted in the context of inconsistency measurement where free formulas can influence the inconsistency degree [20,4]. To illustrate, consider the propositional base K = {p \u2192 q, \u00acp \u2192 r, \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr} provided in [4]. Here, there is a single MIS {p \u2192 q, p \u2192 r}; neglecting the presence of q and r in these formulas fails to capture the conflict involving q, r and \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr.\nIn this article, we introduce new syntactic concepts for analyzing and handling propositional inconsistency. Our approach particularly focuses on the role of variable occurrences within conflicts. Initially, it distinguishes between occurrences of the same variable, then identifies equivalences between these occurrences that contribute to conflicts. This approach allows us to capture the interactions of variable occurrences in inconsistent propositional bases and provides a new strategy for restoring consistency.\nWe first introduce a concept called Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR), which corresponds to a minimal equivalence relation on variable occurrences that leads to inconsistency. For instance, the conflict between q, r and \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr in the previous propositional base K is an MIR: the equivalence relation pairs the occurrences of q as well as the occurrences of r.\nBeyond the interactions between variable occurrences, MIRs also highlight additional aspects of the captured conflicts. Specifically, they reveal the variables implicated and the specific formulas they are part of, given that each occurrence appears in a unique formula. In particular, when we focus on the formulas associated with MIRS, we capture at least as many conflicts as MISes, and generally more.\nWe also introduce a dual concept called Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR), which corresponds to a maximal equivalence relation on variable occurrences constructed to avoid inconsistency. We provide a duality property between MIRS and MCRs, analogous to the minimal hitting set duality observed between MISes and the complements of MCSes [17,1].\n\u00b9 We use the term \u201csyntactic\" to refer to approaches in the literature that focus on the form of belief bases, including methods based on consistent subsets and proof theory. In contrast, other approaches use new semantics to ensure that even inconsistent belief bases have models (e.g., see [15])"}, {"title": "3", "content": "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\nUsing MCRs, we introduce several non-explosive inference relations. Similar to MCS-based approaches, the essential principle behind using MCRs is to maintain the propositional base as close to the original as possible after alterations. However, unlike MCS-based methods, our approach retains every formula and variable present in the original propositional base. An MCS does not alter any original formula but excludes some to restore consistency, whereas an MCR is used to modify certain formulas without excluding any to achieve the same goal.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new semantics that assigns truth values to variable occurrences rather than to the variables themselves. This approach mirrors the technique discussed earlier and can be seen as another strategy for restoring consistency. We specifically demonstrate that each occurrence-based model corresponds uniquely to an MCR. The entailment in our framework of occurrence-based semantics is realized through Boolean interpretations that are compatible with these occurrence-based interpretations."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "The language of classical propositional logic is constructed by inductive definition, starting with a countably infinite set of propositional variables denoted PV. We employ the usual connectives \u00ac and \u2227 to express logical relationships. The set of well-formed formulas is referred to as PF. The connectives \u2228, \u2192 and \u2194 are defined in terms of \u2227 and \u00ac as usual.\nWe use the letters p, q and r, along with x, y and z, each possibly modified with subscripts, to denote propositional variables. For formulas, we employ Greek letters such as \u03c6, \u03c8, and \u03c7. When discussing a syntactic entity X (e.g., a formula or a set of formulas), the set of variables contained in X is denoted by var(X).\nConsidering formulas \u03c6, \u03c8\u2081, ..., \u03c8\u2096, along with variables p\u2081, ..., p\u2096 in var(\u03c6), we use \u03c6[p\u2081/\u03c8\u2081,...,p\u2096/\u03c8\u2096] to denote the result of simultaneously substituting p\u2081,..., p\u2096 with \u03c8\u2081,..., \u03c8\u2096, respectively.\nA Boolean interpretation, or simply interpretation, is a function w that assigns a truth value in {0,1} to each formula in PF and meets the following conditions: w(\u00ac\u03c6) = 1 \u2212 w(\u03c6) and w(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) = w(\u03c6) \u00d7 w(\u03c8).\nGiven an interpretation w, a variable p, and v \u2208 {0,1}, define w\\p\u2194v as the same as w except that it assigns v to p. For variables p\u2081,p\u2082,..., p\u2096 and truth values v\u2081, v\u2082, ..., v\u2096, we use w\\p\u2081\u21a6v\u2081,p\u2082\u21a6v\u2082,...,p\u2096\u21a6v\u2096 as a shorthand notation for (...((w\\p\u2081\u2194v\u2081)\\p\u2082\u2194v\u2082)...)\\p\u2096\u2194v\u2096.\nAn interpretation w is said to be a model of \u03c6, denoted by w \u22a8 \u03c6, if and only if w(\u03c6) = 1. The set of models for \u03c6 is denoted by mod(\u03c6). Conversely, w is a countermodel of \u03c6, denoted by w \u22e6 \u03c6, if and only if w(\u03c6) = 0.\nA formula is considered consistent if it admits at least one model; otherwise, it is referred to as inconsistent.\nA propositional base (PB) is a finite subset of PF.\nWe say that a PB K entails \u03c6, written K \u22a8 \u03c6, when for any interpretation w, if w \u22a8 K (the conjunction of all formulas in K), it holds that w \u22a8 \u03c6; note"}, {"title": "4", "content": "D. Crowley et al.\nthat w \u22a8 \u03c6 holds for every interpretation w. For cases where K contains only a single formula \u03c6, we sometimes use \u03c6 \u22a8 \u03c6.\nA minimal inconsistent subset (MIS) of a PB K is a subset M of K where M is inconsistent, and for every \u03c6 \u2208 M, M \\ {\u03c6} is consistent. A maximal consistent subset (MCS) of K is a subset M of K where M is consistent, and for every \u03c6 \u2208 K \\ M, M \u222a {\u03c6} is inconsistent.\nGiven a formula \u03c6, we establish the polarity of each subformula occurrence in \u03c6 using the following rules:\nThe polarity of the occurrence \u03c6 is defined as positive.\nIf a subformula occurrence \u03c8 \u2227 \u03c7 is positively (resp. negatively) polarized, then both \u03c8 and \u03c7 inherit the same positive (resp. negative) polarity.\nIf a subformula occurrence \u00ac\u03c8 is positively (resp. negatively) polarized, then \u03c8 is assigned a negative (resp. positive) polarity.\nA propositional variable that occurs with only one polarity in \u03c6 is called pure in \u03c6.\nIn the proposition below, both the first two properties and the last two properties can be proven simultaneously through mutual induction on the structure of \u03c6.\nProposition 1. Let \u03c6 be a propositional formula and p a variable in var(\u03c6). Then, the following holds:\nIf p is a positive pure variable in \u03c6 and w is a model of \u03c6, then w\\p\u21941 is a model of \u03c6.\nIf p is a negative pure variable in \u03c6 and w is a counter-model of \u03c6, then w\\p\u21941 is a counter-model of \u03c6.\nIf p is a negative pure variable in \u03c6 and w is a model of \u03c6, then w\\p\u21940 is a model of \u03c6.\nIf p is a positive pure variable in \u03c6 and w is a counter-model of \u03c6, then w\\p\u21940 is a counter-model of \u03c6.\nProof. We only consider the first two properties, as the proof for the others is similar. The proof proceeds by mutual induction on the structure of \u03c6. The base case is straightforward: w\\p\u21941(p) = 1. The inductive case \u03c6 = \u03c8 \u2227 \u03c7 is obtained by applying the induction hypothesis. For instance, w \u22a8 \u03c6 implies w \u22a8 \u03c8 and w \u22a8 \u03c7, leading to w\\p\u21941 \u22a8 \u03c8 and w\\p\u21941 \u22a8 \u03c7. Consider now the inductive case \u03c6 = \u00ac\u03c8. We prove the first property here; the other follows from a symmetrical argument. First, note that p is negative in \u03c6 since it is positive in \u03c8. From w \u22a8 \u03c6, we deduce w is a counter-model of \u03c8. Thus, applying the induction hypothesis, w\\p\u21941 also becomes a counter-model of \u03c8, which results in w\\p\u21941 \u22a8 \u03c6.\nWe define nbOcc(p, \u03c6) as the number of occurrences of variable p in \u03c6. To unambiguously identify and reference each occurrence of p in \u03c6, we employ integers ranging from 1 to nbOcc(p, \u03c6). Indeed, for a formula \u03c6 in a PB, a variable p occurring in \u03c6, and an index i ranging from 1 to nbOcc(p, \u03c6), (p, \u03c6, i) is used to denote the i th occurrence of p in \u03c6 (ordered from left to right). Given a PB"}, {"title": "5", "content": "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n\u039a = {\u03c6\u2081,..., \u03c6\u2099} and a variable p occurring in K, we sometimes use p\u1d62\u02e2 to denote the i th occurrence of p in \u03c6\u2081 \u2227 ... \u2227 \u03c6\u2099, where s is the polarity of this occurrence.\nAdditionally, we use Occ(K) to denote the set of all variable occurrences in K, and Occ(p, K) to denote the set of occurrences of p in K. We also use PosOcc(K) and NegOcc(K) to represent the positive and negative variable occurrences in K, respectively. Similarly, PosOcc(p, K) and NegOcc(p, K) correspond to the positive and negative occurrences of p in K.\nFor instance, if K = {p \u2192 q, \u00acp \u2192 r, \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr}, then Occ(K) = {p\u207a\u2081, p\u207b\u2082, q\u207a\u2081, q\u207b\u2082, r\u207a\u2081, r\u207b\u2082}, PosOcc(K) = {p\u207a\u2081,q\u207a\u2081,r\u207a\u2081}, NegOcc(K) = {p\u207b\u2082, q\u207b\u2082, r\u207b\u2082}, and Occ(p, K) = {p\u207a\u2081, p\u207b\u2082}.\nLet us recall that an equivalence relation on a set S is a binary relation \u223c on S that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The equivalence class of e \u2208 S under \u223c is represented by [e]. The set of all equivalence classes of S by \u223c is denoted S/\u223c.\n3 Variable Occurrence-based Conflicts\nTo achieve a fine-grained representation of inconsistency in a PB, we focus on the occurrences of variables and the conflicts resulting from the relationships between them. Our approach becomes particularly valuable when variable occurrences that are supposed to convey identical information end up representing conflicting data due to various factors such as data errors or interpretive differences. Consider, for instance, the case of conflicting medical reports for the same patient but from different laboratories, where each symptom is represented by a propositional variable (each variable occurrence is linked to a specific laboratory result). A symptom like \"high temperature\" might be differently reported depending on the laboratory's threshold: a temperature of 39\u00b0C might be classified as high by a laboratory with a threshold of 39\u00b0C, but not by one with a threshold of 40\u00b0C.\nA method for resolving all conflicts in a PB involves substituting every occurrence of a variable with a distinct, new variable. Given a PB K, a C-renaming of K is a function R that assigns a distinct, new variable to each occurrence o in Occ(K). We use R(K) to denote the modified version of K achieved by replacing each occurrence o with R(o). This concept of C-renaming is applied identically to formulas.\nSince the choice of C-renaming does not affect our definitions, we consider this function to be fixed and denoted R for any PB and for any formula. To enhance readability, we use the letters p, q, and r to denote the variables occurring in the original PB, and x, y, and z for those in R(K).\nThe following proposition is mainly due to the fact that the new variables associated with the same original variable are equivalent.\nProposition 2. A PB K is inconsistent iff the following formula is inconsistent:\n\u2227R(K) \u2227 \u2227 (R(o) \u2194 R(o')).\np\u2208var(K) o,o'\u2208Occ(p,K)"}, {"title": "6", "content": "D. Crowley et al.\nConsidering a PB K, we define an equivalence relation \u223c\u2096 on Occ(K) as follows: o \u223c\u2096 o' iff var(o) = var(o').\nLet us now introduce the main concept we use to represent conflicts.\nDefinition 1 (Minimal Inconsistency Relation). A Minimal Inconsistency Relation (MIR) of a PB K is an equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K) satisfying the following conditions:\n(Compliance) for all occurrences o, o' \u2208 Occ(K), if o \u223c o', then var(o) = var(o');\n(Inconsistency) R(K) \u2227 \u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c (R(o) \u2194 R(o')) is inconsistent; and\n(Minimality) there exists no equivalence relation \u223c' on Occ(K) that satisfies Properties (1) and (2), and \u223c' is a proper subset of \u223c (i.e., \u223c' \u228a \u223c).\nThe set of all MIRs of K is represented by MIRs(K).\nThe Compliance condition states that equivalence can only occur between occurrences of the same variable. The Inconsistency condition says that every MIR must result in inconsistency. The Minimality condition guarantees that every MIR is minimal with respect to set inclusion.\nUsing the Compliance condition, it is evident that \u223c \u2286 \u223c\u2096 holds for any PB K and any MIR \u223c of K.\nExample 1. Consider the inconsistent PB K\u2081 = {p \u2192 q, \u00acp \u2227 r, \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr} and R(K\u2081) = {x\u2081 \u2227 y\u2081, \u00acx\u2082 \u2227 z\u2081, \u00acy\u2082 \u2228 \u00acz\u2082}. The PB K\u2081 admits two MIRs \u223c\u2081 and \u223c\u2082: Occ(K\u2081)/ \u223c\u2081 = {{p\u207a\u2081, p\u207b\u2082}, {q\u207a\u2081}, {q\u207b\u2082}, {r\u207a\u2081}, {r\u207b\u2082}} and Occ(K\u2081)/ \u223c\u2082 = {{p\u207a\u2081}, {p\u207b\u2082}{q\u207a\u2081,q\u207b\u2082}, {r\u207a\u2081, r\u207b\u2082}}.\nThe next theorem is mainly derived from Proposition 2.\nTheorem 1. A PB is inconsistent iff it admits at least one MIR.\nProof. This result mainly follows from Proposition 2: a PB K is inconsistent if and only if satisfies Property 2 in the definition of MIR.\nIf Part. Assume that K admits a MIR \u223c. By definition, R(K)\u2227\u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c(R(o) \u2194 R(o')) is inconsistent. This leads to the inconsistency of R(K)\u2227 \u2227p\u2208Var(K) \u2227o,o'\u2208Occ(p,K) (R(o) \u2194 R(o')). Applying Proposition 2, it follows that K is inconsistent.\nOnly If Part. Suppose that K is inconsistent. By Proposition 2, R(K) \u2227 \u2227p\u2208Var(K) \u2227o,o'\u2208Occ(p,K) (R(o) \u2194 R(o')) is also inconsistent. This implies that \u223c satisfies the Inconsistency property in the definition of MIR. Thus, there exists \u223c \u2286 \u223c that satisfies the Inconsistency and Minimality properties. Compliance is also clearly satisfied by \u223c.\nThe proposition below demonstrates that each equivalence class with more than one element includes both positive and negative occurrences.\nProposition 3. Let K be a PB. For every MIR \u223c of K and every C \u2208 Occ(K)/ \u223c with |C| \u2265 2, it holds that C \u2229 PosOcc(K) \u2260 \u2205 and C \u2229 NegOcc(K) \u2260 \u2205."}, {"title": "7", "content": "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\nProof. Assume for contradiction that there exists an equivalence class C = {o\u2081,..., o\u2096} s. t. k > 2 and C \u2229 NegOcc(K) = \u2205. Consider refining the equivalence relation to \u223c', where Occ(K)/ \u223c' = ((Occ(K)/ \u223c) \\ C) \u222a \u222a\u2092\u2208C {{o}}. Using Minimality, \u223c' does not satisfy Inconsistency. Thus R(K) \u2227 \u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c' (R(o) \u2194 R(o')) admits a model w. Since for every o in C, R(o) is positive in R(K), and applying Proposition 1, w\\R(o\u2081)\u21941,...,R(o\u2096)\u21941 is also a model of R(K). Consequently, R(K) \u2227 \u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c (R(o) \u2194 R(o')) is consistent, leading to a contradiction.\nA similar contradiction arises if we assume C \u2229 PosOcc(K) = \u2205. This is obtained by using the truth value 0 instead of 1.\nGiven a PB K and an equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K), define PN(\u223c) as the set {(o, o') \u2208 PosOcc(K) \u00d7 NegOcc(K) : o \u223c o'}.\nThe following theorem shows that the core of conflicts fundamentally stems from the interactions between positive and negative occurrences. It is primarily a consequence of Proposition 3.\nTheorem 2. Let K be a PB and \u223c an equivalence relation on Occ(K). The relation \u223c is an MIR iff it satisfies the properties of Compliance, Inconsistency, and the following property: (Minimality-2) for every equivalence relation \u223c' on Occ(K) that satisfies Compliance and Inconsistency, PN(\u223c') is not a proper subset of PN(\u223c).\nProof. For the if part, assume for contradiction that \u223c is not a MIR, despite satisfying the given conditions. This implies there exists an equivalence relation \u223c' \u228a \u223c that satisfies Compliance and Inconsistency. Let (o, o') be a pair in \u223c \\ \u223c', where clearly o \u22e6 o'. By Minimality-2, o and o' must have the same polarity. Consider if both o and o' are positive (the argument is symmetrical for both being negative). According to Proposition 3, there must be a negative occurrence o'' such that o \u223c o'' and o' \u223c o''. By the definition of Minimality-2, it must hold that o \u226f' o'' and o' \u226f' o''. Thus, by the transitivity of \u223c', we obtain (o, o') \u2208\u223c', which contradicts (o, o') \u2208\u223c \\ \u223c'.\nConsider the only if part. Assume that \u223c is a MIR. Let \u223c' is another equivalence relation that maintains Compliance and Inconsistency. By Minimality, \u223c' \u2288 \u223c holds. Then, there exists (o, o') \u2208 \u223c' \\ \u223c. If o and o' do not have the same polarity, we obtain PN(\u223c') \u2288 PN(\u223c). Consider the case where o and o' are both positive. Hence, by Proposition 3, there exists a negative occurrence o'' s.t. (o, o'') and (o', o'') belong to PN(\u223c'), leading to PN(\u223c') \u2288 PN(\u223c). The case where they are both positive is similar.\nMIRs can provide a more detailed representation than MISes even in scenarios where the objective is to identify conflicts within subsets of formulas.\nGiven a PB K and an MIR \u223c on Occ(K), formmir(\u223c) represents the set {\u03c6 \u2208 K : \u2203C \u2208 Occ(K)/ \u223c, \u2203p \u2208 var(\u03c6), \u2203i \u2208 N s. t. |C| \u2265 2 and (p, \u03c6, i) \u2208 C}. Informally, formmir(\u223c) corresponds to the formulas that contain the occurrences that are paired with \u223c (excluding reflexive links).\nDefinition 2 (O-MIS). An O-MIS of a PB K is a subset M of K for which there exists an MIR \u223c of K such that M = formmir(\u223c)."}, {"title": "8", "content": "D. Crowley et al.\nGiven that formmir(\u223c) is inconsistent for every MIR \u223c, it follows that every O-MIS includes a MIS.\nProposition 4. Given a PB K, if M is a MIS of K, then M is also an O-MIS of K.\nProof. According to Theorem 1, M is associated with at least one MIR \u223c. Let \u223c' be the equivalence relation on Occ(K) obtained by extending \u223c to pair each occurrence in K \\ M with only itself. Since \u223c is an MIR of M, it follows that \u223c' is an MIR of K. We know that formmir(\u223c') is inconsistent. If formmir(\u223c') \u2286 M, it would contradict the minimality of M. Therefore, we must have formmir(\u223c') = M, implying that M is an O-MIS.\nExample 2. Consider again the PB K\u2081 from Example 1. With respect to the two possible MIRs, \u223c\u2081 and \u223c\u2082, K\u2081 admits two O-MISes: M\u2081 = {p \u2192 q, \u00acp \u2227 r} and M\u2082 = {p \u2192 q, \u00acp \u2227 r, \u00acq \u2228 \u00acr}. However, K\u2081 has only one MIS, namely M\u2081.\nAn interesting application of the MIR and O-MIS concepts is their use in quantifying inconsistency, similar to how MISes have been employed in this context. Several measures can be defined, for instance, by focusing on the number of MIRs, their sizes, or the number of equivalence classes.\n4 A Dual Notion: Maximal Consistency Relation\nThis section focuses on a dual notion to the MIR. This notion is defined as a maximal equivalence relation on variable occurrences constructed to avoid inconsistency.\nDefinition 3 (Maximal Consistency Relation). A Maximal Consistency Relation (MCR) of a PB K is an equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K) satisfying the following conditions:\n(Compliance) for all occurrences o,o' \u2208 Occ(K), if o \u223c o', then var(o) = var(o');\n(Consistency) \u2227R(K) \u2227 \u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c(R(o) \u2194 R(o')) is consistent; and\n(Maximality) there exists no equivalence relation \u223c' on Occ(K) that satisfies Properties (1) and (2), and \u223c is a proper subset of \u223c' (i.e., \u223c \u228a \u223c').\nLet MCRs(K) represent the set of all MCRs of K.\nLike MCSes, MCRs are uniquely determined in consistent PBs.\nProposition 5. For every consistent PB K, the relation \u223c\u2096 is the unique MCR of K.\nExample 3. Revisiting the inconsistent PB K\u2081 from Example 1, we find that it admits two MCRs \u223c\u2081 and \u223c\u2082, where Occ(K\u2081)/ \u223c\u2081 = {{p\u207a\u2081}, {p\u207b\u2082}, {q\u207a\u2081,q\u207b\u2082}, {r\u207a\u2081}, {r\u207b\u2082}} and Occ(K\u2081)/ \u223c\u2082 = {{p\u207a\u2081}, {p\u207b\u2082}, {q\u207a\u2081}, {q\u207b\u2082}, {r\u207a\u2081,r\u207b\u2082}}."}, {"title": "9", "content": "Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\nForgetting is a well-established method for restoring consistency [13,11,5]. In particular, Besnard [5], in the context of defining an inconsistency measure, proposes substituting variable occurrences with constants to achieve consistency. The MCR concept can further enhance this perspective by providing a more holistic view.\nFor example, consider the PB K = {p\u2081 \u2227 ... \u2227 p\u2099, \u00acp\u2081 \u2227 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u2227 \u00acp\u2099}. A forgetting-based approach would produce 2\u207f minimal repairs, since each variable p\u1d62 could be individually forgotten to resolve the contradiction between p\u1d62 and \u00acp\u1d62 (this involves replacing either p\u1d62 or \u00acp\u1d62 with \u22a4). In contrast, our approach yields a single MCR \u223c with Occ(K)/ \u223c= {{p\u1d62}, {\u00acp\u1d62} : i = 1, ..., n}.\nGiven a PB K, an equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K), and p in var(K), EqC(p, \u223c) denotes the set of equivalence classes in Occ(K)/ \u223c that contain occurrences of p.\nNote that a variable can be associated with at most two equivalence classes in an MCR. This mainly arises from the observation that in any model w of R(K), each occurrence is associated with one of two possible truth values, 0 and 1.\nProposition 6. Let K be a PB. For every MCR \u223c of K and every variable p \u2208 var(K), the cardinality of EqC(p, \u223c) is at most two, i.e., |EqC(p, \u223c)| \u2264 2.\nProof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an MCR \u223c of K such that |EqC(p, \u223c)| \u2265 3. Let C\u2081, C\u2082, and C\u2083 be three distinct equivalence classes in EqC(p, \u223c). Given the definition of MCR, the formula R(K) \u2227 \u2227(o,o')\u2208\u223c(R(o) \u2194 R(o')) must be consistent. Therefore, a model w of exists. In this model, for any i \u2208 {1,2,3} and any o, o' \u2208 C\u1d62, it holds that w(R(o)) = w(R(o')). Given that there are only two possible truth values, the truth value associated with C\u2083 must match that of either C\u2081 or C\u2082. Assume the truth values for C\u2081 and C\u2082 are identical; the argument for other case is analogous. Consequently, w is also a model of \u2227\u2092\u2208C\u2081,\u2092'\u2208C\u2083 (R(o) \u2194 R(o')), indicating that \u223c fails to maintain the Maximality property. This leads to a contradiction.\nConsider the following complementary definition of Minimality-2:\n(Maximality-2) for every equivalence relation \u223c' on Occ(K) that satisfies Compliance and Consistency, PN(\u223c) is not a proper subset of PN(\u223c').\nThe goal in the foregoing condition is to maximize the equivalence between positive and negative occurrences. This is grounded in the understanding that the essence of conflicts mainly arises from the interactions between positive and negative occurrences.\nDefinition 4 (BMCR). A BMCR of a PB K is an MCR \u223c of K that satisfies Maximality-2.\nIn the definition of MIR, we demonstrated that incorporating Minimality-2 does not affect the concept, as replacing Minimality with Minimality-2 yields the same notion. However, the following example illustrates that MCRs are not always BMCRs."}, {"title": "10", "content": "D. Crowley et al.\nExample 4. Consider the PB K\u2082 = {p, \u00acp, \u00acp \u2228 q}. It admits two MCRs \u223c\u2081 and \u223c\u2082, where Occ(K\u2082)/ \u223c\u2081 = {{p\u207a\u2081,p\u207b\u2083},{p\u207b\u2082},{q\u207a\u2081}} and Occ(K\u2082)/ \u223c\u2082 = {{p\u207a\u2081}, {p\u207b\u2082,p\u207b\u2083},{q\u207a\u2081}}. The unique BMCR is \u223c\u2082 because PN(\u223c\u2081) = {(p\u207a\u2081,p\u207b\u2083)} and PN(\u223c\u2082) = \u2205.\nThe minimal hitting set duality between MISes and the complements of MC-Ses asserts that every MIS is a minimal hitting set of the set of all complements of MCSes, and vice versa (e.g., see [17,1,12]). This property is particularly useful for computing all MISes and MCSes. Here, we show that a similar duality property exists between MIRS and MCRs.\nLet U be a set of elements and S = {S\u2081, ..., S\u2096} a collection of subsets of U. A hitting set of S is a set H \u2286 U that intersects with every element of S, i.e., for every S\u1d62 \u2208 S, S\u1d62 \u2229 H \u2260 \u2205. A hitting set is said to be minimal if no proper subset of it can also serve as a hitting set.\nTo establish the duality properties, we need some preliminary notions.\nDefinition 5 (H-Maximality). Let K be a PB and H \u2286 \u223c\u2096. An equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K), where \u223c \u2286 \u223c\u2096, is said to be H-maximal if it meets the following conditions: (i) \u223c \u2229 H = \u2205, and (ii) for any equivalence relation \u223c' \u2286 \u223c\u2096 with \u223c \u228a \u223c', \u223c' \u2229 H \u2260 \u2205.\nDefinition 6 (H-Minimality). Let K be a PB and H \u2286 \u223c\u2096. An equivalence relation \u223c on Occ(K), where \u223c \u2286 \u223c\u2096, is said to be H-minimal if it meets the following conditions: (i) H \u2286 \u223c, and (ii) for any equivalence relation \u223c' \u2287 \u223c, H \u2288 \u223c'.\nAlternatively stated, an equivalence relation \u223c \u2286 \u223c\u2096 is H-maximal if and only if it excludes all elements of H and is maximal with respect to set inclusion. The relation \u223c is H-minimal if and only if it includes all elements of H and is minimal with respect to set inclusion.\nDefinition 7 (C-MCR). A C-MCR of a PB K is a relation \u03b8 on Occ(K) such that \u223c\u2096 \\ \u03b8 is an MCR.\nLet CMCRs(K) represent the set of all C-MCRs of K.\nFor simplicity, the duality theorem references MCRs in one property and C-MCRs in the other.\nTheorem 3. Let K be a PB and \u223c an equivalence relation on Occ(K) s.t. \u223c \u2286 \u223c\u2096. Then, the following properties hold:\n\u223c is an MCR of K iff there exists a minimal hitting set H of MIRs(K) such that \u223c is H-maximal.\n\u223c is an MIR if and only if there exists a minimal hitting set H of CMCRs(K) such that \u223c is H-minimal.\nProof.

When an"}, {"title": "2. Literature Review", "content": "2.1. Multi-Agent Systems and Their Increasing Popularity\n\nAdvances in large language models and generative Al have spurred many organizations to investigate multi-agent frameworks for more scalable and intricate applications (Cruz, 2024; Rasheed et al., 2024). In essence, multi-agent systems break tasks into sub-tasks, each handled by autonomous agents capable of local decision-making and inter-agent communication. This division enhances concurrency, modularity, and parallel processing, which is invaluable for complex tasks like data analysis, knowledge retrieval, summarization, and content generation.\n\nMicrosoft's Magentic-One exemplifies a multi-agent platform that incorporates specialized modules (e.g., for natural language processing or code debugging), all orchestrated by an overarching controller (Fourney et al., 2024). Similarly, OpenAI's Swarm (Bigio, 2024) organizes workflow segments-termed \u201croutines and handoffs\" to enable parallelization and avoid overloading any single specialized agent. While these systems showcase the benefits of multi-agent orchestration, they typically assume permanent agent roles, lacking an automated mechanism for replacing persistently underperforming agents.\n\nAmazon has proposed Knowledge Graph Enhanced Language Agents (KGLA) for recommendation systems, which deploy separate agents to simulate user behavior, identify correct purchase intents, and track incorrect intents (Guo et al., 2024). Li et al. (2024) further noted that sparse agent communication topologies might improve collective reasoning by allowing more time for consensus-building. However, an automated approach for removing or upgrading ineffective agents has remained largely unexplored.\n\n2.2. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Generative AI\n\nParallel to multi-agent research, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) strategy has become pivotal in deep learning. MoE entails multiple \u201cexpert\u201d networks, each fine-tuned for a specialized aspect or subset of the overall task domain, and a \"gating\" network that selects which expert(s) to"}, {"title": "2.3. Existence of Incompetent Agents", "content": "A significant concern in multi-agent systems is the persistence of underperforming or \u201cincompetent\u201d agents. Model drift, limited training data, or new domain requirements can erode an agent's effectiveness over time (Motwani et al., 2024). Existing multi-agent frameworks typically rely on human administrators to identify and replace stagnant agents, rather than automatically employ an internal mechanism for competitive improvement. Addressing this gap, the RLFA algorithm introduces a market-like dynamic where agents can be automatically swapped, akin to professional sports free agency."}, {"title": "2.4. Fraud Detection and Free Agents", "content": "Fraud detection exemplifies why an automated system for replacing outdated agents is critical. Tasks commonly involve parsing communications, detecting anomalies, and monitoring user behaviors. If any of these specialized agents fail to adapt to evolving tactics\u2014such as new phishing methods the entire operation's security is jeopardized. By adopting a free agent concept akin to MLB, the system promptly dismisses underperforming agents and adds newly retrained or specialized models that address emerging fraud vectors. A reinforcement learning reward schema guides the new agent to optimize fraud detection rates, minimize false positives, and preserve synergy with other agents."}, {"title": "3. Concept", "content": "3.1. Conceptual Overview of RLFA\n\nThe Reinforcement Learning Free Agent (RLFA) algorithm introduces a sports-inspired mechanism for replacing underperforming agents with stronger candidates. Drawing on Major League Baseball (MLB) free-agency rules, we propose that an agent reaches \u201cfree-agent status\" after accruing a certain \u201cservice time\u201d in the system or upon being \u201creleased\u201d for subpar performance. Once an agent gains free-agency, it is no longer bounded by its initial \"contract\" and is able to be recruited by any \u201cteam\u201d (i.e., any segment of the multi-agent framework needing a replacement).\n\nService Time and Control\n\nIn MLB, players become free agents after six years of Major League service or if they are released sooner. Analogously, our RLFA system measures an agent's \u201cservice time\u201d using metrics such as completed tasks,"}, {"title": "Release and Eligibility", "content": "In MLB, a player released before reaching six years of service may sign a new contract yet does not have full free-agency rights until meeting the required threshold. By analogy, if an RLFA agent underperforms, it can be \"released\" before it fulfills its service time. Upon release, the agent enters the free-agent \"pool,\u201d making it available for re-hiring-either by the same subsystem if its performance improves or by a different subsystem relying on its expertise. Until the agent accrues the necessary service time, however, it may face constraints such as limited data access or narrower task assignments, akin to MLB arbitration.\n\nThese free-agency constructs endow RLFA with flexibility and an inherent mechanism for continuous improvement. Underperforming agents do not linger indefinitely, while high-potential agents can join or rejoin at opportune moments."}, {"title": "3.1.1. Reward Design", "content": "In the Reinforcement Learning Free Agent (RLFA) approach, each agent is trained and evaluated using a reward mechanism that reflects performance across multiple dimensions. Building on traditional reinforcement learning paradigms, our methodology defines a multi-factor reward function for each agent iii at time ttt.

Mixture-of-Experts Integration", "content": "While RLFA controls agent-level transitions, each agent can internally adopt a mixture-of-experts (MoE) paradigm.

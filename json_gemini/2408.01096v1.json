{"title": "SIX DRAGONS FLY AGAIN: REVIVING 15TH-CENTURY KOREAN\nCOURT MUSIC WITH TRANSFORMERS AND NOVEL ENCODING", "authors": ["Danbinaerin Han", "Mark Gotham", "Dongmin Kim", "Hannah Park", "Sihun Lee", "Dasaem Jeong"], "abstract": "We introduce a project that revives a piece of 15th-century\nKorean court music, Chihwapyeong and Chwipunghyeong,\ncomposed upon the poem Songs of the Dragon Flying\nto Heaven. One of the earliest examples of Jeongganbo,\na Korean musical notation system, the remaining version\nonly consists of a rudimentary melody. Our research team,\ncommissioned by the National Gugak (Korean Traditional\nMusic) Center, aimed to transform this old melody into\na performable arrangement for a six-part ensemble. Us-\ning Jeongganbo data acquired through bespoke optical mu-\nsic recognition, we trained a BERT-like masked language\nmodel and an encoder-decoder transformer model. We also\npropose an encoding scheme that strictly follows the struc-\nture of Jeongganbo and denotes note durations as posi-\ntions. The resulting machine-transformed version of Chi-\nhwapyeong and Chwipunghyeong were evaluated by ex-\nperts and performed by the Court Music Orchestra of Na-\ntional Gugak Center. Our work demonstrates that genera-\ntive models can successfully be applied to traditional music\nwith limited training data if combined with careful design.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Six dragons fly on the east land; every endeavour is\na heavenly blessing. This is the first line of lyrics in\nYongbieocheonga, the first text written in the Korean\nalphabet (Hangul, \ud55c\uae00). Sejong the Great, one of the\nmost respected figures in Korean history, invented and\nintroduced Hangul in 1446. In addition to this remark-\nable achievement, he ordered scholar-officials to write\nYongbieocheonga, and composed music to accompany\nthe lyrics.

RELATED WORKS", "content": "Recent advances in neural network-based music genera-\ntion have resulted in much artistic output. Since 2020, the\nAI Music Generation Challenge [4] has been held annu-\nally, focusing on generating songs in the style of Irish and\nSwedish folk music. This event has allowed for exploration\nof new methods for generation and evaluation of traditional\nmusic through the means of deep learning models.\nThe Beethoven X project [5] utilized neural networks\nto learn Beethoven's compositional style and complete his\nunfinished 10th Symphony. The resulting work has been\nperformed by an orchestra\u2014a project outline similar to\nthat of ours.\nAttempts at automatic generation have been made for\ntraditional music from beyond the West, including Per-\nsia [6] and China [7]. The limited progress in such areas\nis often due to the distinctive traditional musical systems\nthat demand deep understanding and unique methodolo-\ngies. Such idiosyncrasies put much interest and meaning\nin the computational research of traditional music, since it\ncan present new methods and perspectives to the field as\na whole, while also helping preserve diverse musical her-\nitages."}, {"title": "3. JEONGGANBO DATASET", "content": "As depicted in Figure 1, Korean court music is performed\non a variety of instruments, including plucked string in-\nstruments (Gayageum and Geomungo), bowed string in-\nstruments (Haegeum and Ajaeng), and wind instruments"}, {"title": "3.1 Jeongganbo Notation", "content": "Much of Korean court music is written in Jeongganbo,\na traditional musical notation system. Jeongganbo is rec-\nognized as the first system in East Asia capable of simulta-\nneously representing both pitch and duration of notes [8,9].\nThis versatility has been instrumental in passing down\ncourt music throughout history [10].\nJeongganbo uses grid-divided boxes (Jeonggans) as\nthe basic unit of time. The number of characters (notes)\nand their position within each jeonggan varies to denote\nrhythm. Figure 2 provides an example passage, and figure\n3 provides a schematic overview of possible positions.\nHere, we provide a broad introduction to this rhythmic\nnotation system in quasi-Western musical theoretic lan-\nguage. Each jeonggan is broadly equivalent to a beat. If a\njeonggan features only one character, this note event starts\nat the beginning of the beat and lasts the beat's full dura-\ntion. The first box ('0') in figure 3 is in this form as is the\nsecond jeonggan of figure 2 where the 'compound beats'\ncorrespond to the duration J. (in this case for the note Bb4).\nAt the next metrical level we have the 'column' division of\nthe 'rows'. This number of 'rows' relates broadly to the\ntop level division of the beat. The use of three vertically\nstacked characters refers to 3 equal divisions of this beat\n(here, 3 x s).\nFor example, in figure 3, the numbers 4-9 feature a 3-\npart division of the beat into 3 x \u266a (positions 4, 6, 8),\nand a 2x division of thoses (e.g., 4-5). If the following\njeonggan is empty, the previously played note is sustained.\nPlaying techniques and ornamentations called sigimsae\nare sometimes notated for each instrument. When sigimsae\nare placed to the right of notes, they serve as ornamenta-\ntions or embellishments for the corresponding note; when\nwritten on their own, they indicate timed instructions to\nplay a specific note or musical phrase. For convenience,"}, {"title": "3.2 Machine Readable Dataset", "content": "We have constructed a dataset of 85 pieces by applying op-\ntical musical recognition (OMR) to all compositions avail-\nable within the manuscripts published by the National Gu-\ngak Center.

We implemented and trained\nan encoder-decoder transformer with CNN by synthesizing\nvarious Jeonggan images in a rule-based approach [11].\nIn total, the dataset comprises 28010 jeonggans across 85\npieces. When counting each instrument part independently,\nthe combined total amounts to 141 820 jeonggans.

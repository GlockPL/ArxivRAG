While human drivers do this\nintuitively, autonomous vehicles allow and require deliberative algorithmic risk management. But how\nshould traffic risks be distributed among road users? In a global experimental study in eight countries\nwith different cultural backgrounds and almost 11,000 participants, we compared risk distribution\npreferences. It turns out that risk preferences in road traffic are strikingly similar between the cultural\nzones. The vast majority of participants in all countries deviates from a guiding principle of minimizing\naccident probabilities in favor of weighing up the probability and severity of accidents. At the national\nlevel, the consideration of accident probability and severity hardly differs between countries. The social\ndilemma of autonomous vehicles detected in deterministic crash scenarios disappears in risk\nassessments of everyday traffic situations in all countries. In no country do cyclists receive a risk bonus\nthat goes beyond their higher vulnerability. In sum, our results suggest that a global consensus on the\nrisk ethics of autonomous driving is easier to establish than on the ethics of crashing.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "All driving involves risks of an accident (Goodall, 2016a). Accidents can occur due to technical failure,\nhuman error or unforeseeable events (Goodall, 2019). If other road users are around, they are also\naffected by the risk of a collision. In these ubiquitous situations, every driving maneuver exerts a\nmarginal effect on the risks to other road users (Goodall, 2019; Bonnefon, Shariff & Rahwan, 2019).\nOften, trade-offs arise in these situations in which the risk of a collision with one road user decreases\nwhile the risk of a collision with another increases (Goodall, 2019; Bonnefon, Shariff & Rahwan, 2019;\nKr\u00fcgel & Uhl, 2022; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl, 2024). A car overtaking a cyclist is an example of such a situation\n(Bonnefon, Shariff & Rahwan, 2019). The greater the lateral distance to the cyclist, the greater the risk\nof a collision with a road user on the other side of the road. The smaller the distance to the cyclist, the\ngreater the risk of a collision with that cyclist. Lateral lane positioning, in general, is a typical example\nof these risk considerations (Goodall, 2016a; Goodall, 2019). Various braking strategies for avoiding a\ncollision with a leading vehicle while simultaneously risking a collision with a trailing vehicle is another\ntypical example of such risk considerations (Goodall, 2019).\nThe distribution of risks to other road users depending on one's own driving behavior has clear ethical\nimplications. When risks are redistributed between different road users, dilemma situations arise in a\nrisk-ethical context (Nyholm & Smids, 2016; Geisslinger et al., 2021; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl, 2022; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl,\n2024). In contrast to the unrealistic moral dilemmas in trolley-like problems (Foot, 1967) of unavoidable\naccident scenarios, these dilemmas are part of everyday traffic situations (Goodall, 2019; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl,\n2024). While human road users solve these risk-ethical dilemmas intuitively, AVs must do so on the\nbasis of a carefully planned risk management (Goodall, 2016a, b). What factors should play a role in\nthis risk management and who decides this?\nMuch of the engineering literature on AVs is exclusively concerned with minimizing the probability of\naccidents (see, e.g., Reichardt & Shick, 1994; Gehrig & Stein, 2007; Erlien, Fujita & Gerdes, 2013; Wolf\n& Burdick, 2008; Keller et al., 2014; Funke et al. 2015; Wachenfeld et al., 2016; Gerdes & Thornton,\n2016; Thornton et al., 2016; Claussmann et al., 2020). Collision avoidance is often seen as a\n\"deontological rule\" (Thornton et al., 2016) that takes \"the highest priority of the automated vehicle\"\n(Thornton et al., 2016). Other factors, such as accident severity, tend to be ignored in the engineering\nliterature on the risk management of AVs. Some automotive companies seem to be going a bit further.\nIn some of its patents, Google Inc. and later Waymo LLC, for instance, discuss the possibility of taking\nother factors into account in the risk management of AVs, such as accident severity, as well as the type,\nsize and vulnerability of the other road users, in addition to the probability of an accident (see Dolgov\n& Urmson, 2014; Teller & Lombrozo, 2014, 2015, 2019). In turn, the ethical literature on AVs largely\nfocuses exclusively on accident severity and the distribution of damages (see, e.g., Bonnefon, Shariff &\nRahwan, 2016; Awad et al., 2018; Faulhaber et al., 2019; Frank et al., 2019; Huang, Greene & Bazerman,\n2019; Bigman & Gray, 2020; Morita & Managi, 2020), and mostly disregards accident probabilities\naltogether.\nApparently, the prevailing view of the relevant factors in the risk management of AVs depends heavily\non the discipline. This is unsatisfactory, of course. Another approach is surveying the public's views on\nAVs' risk management. First, it is important to know what the public expects of AVs' behavior in road\ntraffic, not least in order to address a possible discrepancy between public's expectations and actual\nbehavior of AVs in a public discourse (see, e.g., Bonnefon, Shariff & Rahwan, 2016; Adnan et al., 2018;\nAwad et al., 2018; Cunningham et al., 2019; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl, 2022). Second, the public constitutes the\ngroup of those affected by AVs \u2013 they bear the risks arising from AVs' behavior in road traffic. The public\nshould therefore also have a say in how AVs should ideally behave on the road (Bonnefon, Shariff &\nRahwan, 2019; Kr\u00fcgel & Uhl, 2024). It should be emphasized here that desired and technically feasible"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Mean driving positions per country\nWe first examine the mean positioning in each country in situations in which the AV was traveling\nbetween two cars. We compare situations in which an empty AV was traveling between two cars with\none or five passengers with situations in which an AV with the participants as a passenger was traveling"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The morally preferred distribution of risks between road users is strikingly similar between the eight\ndifferent countries from diverse cultural regions of the world. This holds true for all three major findings\nof our study. These are, first, that most people deviate considerably from the guiding principle of\naccident avoidance and take an accident's potential severity into account when adjusting the AV's\nposition within a lane. At the national level, the weighting of accident probability and severity was\nalmost the same in all countries. Second, the social dilemma of AVs that was observed in deterministic\ncontexts with unavoidable accidents evaporates in stochastic contexts in which accidents are possible\nbut unlikely. Third, in none of the eight countries do risk preferences differ between road user types\nwhen controlling for varying vulnerability. Cyclists do not receive a bonus in the risk management of\nAVs compared to car drivers that goes beyond their higher vulnerability.\nOn an implicational level, our results suggest that a moral consensus on the risk ethics of AVs might be\nachievable. In fact, it may be more easily achievable than a moral consensus on the ethics of crashing\nin unavoidable accident scenarios where differences in moral attitudes could be identified between\nculturally diverse clusters (Awad et al., 2018). Especially the consistent mitigation of the social dilemma\nof AVs in stochastic contexts that we observe in our study seems encouraging when it comes to the\nglobal acceptance of AVs. In a globalized market, the prospect of AVs that do not have to fundamentally\nadjust their operating principles when crossing international borders to adapt to different risk\npreferences might help to realize economies of scale.\nThe advent of AVs offers the chance for a more deliberate management of traffic risks. Eliciting road\nusers' preferred risk distributions allows to democratize the ethics of AVs by explicitly implementing\npeople's moral preferences within the limits of technological feasibility. The desired behavior of AVs is\nfirst and foremost a political question on a societal scale (Himmelreich, 2018). Its technical feasibility is\nthen a question for engineering. A lack of feasibility with today's technological means does not\npreclude feasibility with future technological means. The achievability of socially desirable solutions\ncan, for instance, be steered by funding calls.\nBeyond the specific functionality of AVs, however, the elicitation of road users' risk preferences might\nalso help to democratize the risk ethics of the entire traffic system. Trade-offs are factually resolved in\nthe specific design of our traffic infrastructure.

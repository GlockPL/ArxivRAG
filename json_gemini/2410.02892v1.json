However, there is ongoing debate regarding their problem-solving reliability. According to Zhou et al. (2024), scaling up and fine-tuning LLMs enhances their capabilities but also diminishes reliability, introducing unpredictable errors even in simple tasks and reducing the effectiveness of human supervision. Conversely, Li et al. (2024) highlights that the application of the Chain of Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b) methodology significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning tasks by enabling inherently serial computations, which pose challenges for low-depth transformers. Furthermore, Bubeck et al. (2023) observes that LLMs demonstrate a high degree of accuracy and consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, particularly when employing techniques such as CoT and self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022). Additionally, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been shown to enhance model performance, notably reducing the incidence of harmful or inaccurate outputs (Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2017). These insights suggest that, despite concerns related to model scalability and the potential for errors introduced during fine-tuning (Zhou et al., 2024), LLMs can exhibit considerable reliability in complex reasoning tasks when guided by structured methodologies and reinforced with human feedback. Ensuring the robustness of LLM outputs remains a critical priority, necessitating further investigation into strategies"}, {"title": null, "content": "aimed at enhancing model resilience and dependability.\nDespite the notable success of LLMs, they face several limitations when dealing with more complex and evolving tasks. In particular, their rigidity in reasoning and difficulty in generalizing across diverse problem types present significant challenges. A key limitation of current LLMs is their reliance on static prompt structures and patterns learned during training, which restricts their adaptability in novel or evolving contexts. These models often apply fixed strategies to problem-solving(Shi et al., 2024; Li, 2024), leading to challenges in tasks that require logical reasoning, such as calculating family relationships, performing numerical comparisons, or counting specific characters in a word (Nezhurina et al., 2024). Although these tasks may seem straightforward, LLMs tend to depend on pre-learned patterns instead of dynamically adjusting their reasoning processes, resulting in errors in more complex problem spaces (Marcus, 2020; Hendrycks et al., 2020). This inflexibility contrasts with human problem-solving, which is typically iterative and adaptive (Sloman, 2009). Humans use inductive reasoning to derive general rules from specific instances and then apply deductive reasoning to novel situations, allowing for dynamic strategy adjustments based on task complexity. In contrast, current LLMs lack this level of flexibility in reasoning, which limits their ability to generalize and adapt to more sophisticated scenarios. This underscores the need for increased attention and research in this area.\nMoreover, LLMs have difficulty generalizing reasoning across tasks that require dynamic adjustment or incremental problem-solving. While LLMs can achieve high accuracy on specific tasks, their performance often degrades when confronted with problems that evolve or require multi-step reasoning. This issue is especially evident in tasks where the model must balance different reasoning strategies or integrate information from multiple sources. Tasks such as stepwise numerical reasoning, temporal reasoning, or complex multi-step inference highlight gaps in LLMs' ability to maintain consistent reasoning across different stages of a task. These models tend to produce inconsistent or contextually inappropriate answers when required to adjust their reasoning dynamically as the problem unfolds. The static and inflexible nature of their reasoning pipeline limits generalization and accuracy, particularly when compared to human problem-solving, which adapts to new information in real-time. Despite improvements with techniques like CoT (Wei et al., 2022b), Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2024), Temperature-Tree-of-Thought (T2oT) (Cai et al., 2024), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) prompting (Besta et al., 2024), current LLMs still struggle to adjust their reasoning dynamically, resulting in difficulties in addressing more fluid and complex tasks.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the De-In-Ductive (DID) method, a novel approach designed to enhance LLM reasoning by integrating both inductive and deductive reasoning processes within the prompt construction framework as the Figure 1 shows. Grounded in cognitive science models of human reasoning, the DID method enables LLMs to adjust their reasoning pathways dynamically in response to the task context and its evolving complexity. In the DID method, inductive reasoning is first used to derive general rules from specific instances, followed by deductive reasoning to apply these rules in solving particular problems. This hybrid reasoning process mirrors human cognitive strategies, allowing the model to adjust its reasoning dynamically based on real-time feedback. By employing this dynamic prompt strategy, the DID method improves the adaptability and flexibility of LLMs, enabling them to better handle complex, evolving problem spaces.\nWe validate the effectiveness of the DID method on established benchmarks such as AIW and MR-GSM8K (Wei et al., 2022a; Cobbe et al., 2021), as well as our custom dataset, Holiday Puzzle, which includes tasks about holiday date calculations.

Deductive reasoning, formalized by philosophers like Kant, involves applying general principles to specific cases, ensuring conclusions logically follow from premises. Inductive reasoning, conversely, generalizes from specific observations to form broader conclusions, as highlighted in The Riddle of Induction (Goodman, 1983). Cognitive models view these modes of reasoning as complementary, where inductive reasoning generates hypotheses, and deductive reasoning tests them (Wason, 1960). The interplay between these two reasoning methods has been shown to enhance problem-solving accuracy, particularly in uncertain domains where balancing exploration and validation is critical (Johnson-Laird, 1983; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Research on mental models and heuristics highlights how this dynamic combination allows for more flexible reasoning, especially in tasks characterized by complexity or ambiguity. Problems in cognitive science are often classified based on their structure and uncertainty: well-structured problems (e.g., mathematical proofs) lend themselves to deductive reasoning, whereas ill-structured or open-ended problems (e.g., scientific discovery) require inductive reasoning to form plausible hypotheses from incomplete data (Funke, 2013). Cognitive insights have been increasingly integrated into neural networks (L Griffiths et al., 2008), with recent studies emphasizing the importance of embedding inductive structures within models to improve generalization across tasks (Tenenbaum et al., 2011). The DID framework builds on this cognitive science foundation by dynamically combining inductive and deductive reasoning within LLMs, creating a hybrid model that mirrors human cognitive processes and enhances adaptability in problem-solving.\nLLMs for Reasoning and Prompting Techniques While LLMs like GPT-4 have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as text generation and summarization (Brown et al., 2020), they often struggle with structured reasoning, particularly in tasks involving logical inference, numerical comparison, and complex deduction (OpenAI, 2023; Nezhurina et al., 2024). These shortcomings have been well-documented in challenges like the ARC Prize (Rae et al., 2021) and in tasks that require step-by-step reasoning or multi-hop inferences. To address these limitations, prompting techniques such as CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), ToT (Yao et al., 2024), and GoT (Besta et al., 2024) have been developed to improve LLMs' capacity for structured reasoning. CoT enhances stepwise reasoning by breaking down complex problems, while ToT and GoT explore multiple solution paths through structured thought representations. However, these approaches remain static, requiring extensive prompt engineering and lacking the dynamic adaptability needed for diverse tasks. Recent work, such as Hypergraph of Thoughts (HoT) (Yao et al., 2023), extends these methods to multimodal and more complex reasoning but still fails to offer the real-time adaptability needed for nuanced problem-solving. Another critical analysis by Marcus (2020) highlights the limitations of current LLMs, emphasizing their struggles with maintaining logical consistency and coherence in complex reasoning tasks. The DID framework addresses these gaps by dynamically integrating inductive and deductive reasoning, making the reasoning process more adaptive and context-sensitive, informed by the probabilistic reasoning advancements seen in the combination of Bayesian models with neural networks (Gershman et al., 2015)."}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "The De-In-Ductive (DID) framework dynamically integrates inductive and deductive reasoning, inspired by cognitive science models of human reasoning.

The Chain of Thought (CoT) Method improves logical reasoning by breaking down complex problems into sequential steps. Our proposed De-In-Ductive (DID) Method goes further by dynamically integrating inductive and deductive reasoning. By iteratively generating and testing hypotheses, DID adapts to problem complexities more effectively than static methods like CoT, optimizing problem-solving by balancing reasoning modes in response to task difficulty. Based on Assumptions 3.1 and 3.1, DID optimizes an objective function that balances both reasoning modes, dynamically adjusting as the complexity of the problem increases.\nInductive Reasoning The inductive phase generates hypotheses from observed data $D_p$.

Since CoT relies on pre-learned patterns and fixed reasoning pathways, it lacks the dynamic adaptability required to handle new and complex problem structures. Specifically, without the ability to adjust a dynamically and integrate inductive hypothesis generation, CoT cannot effectively improve the low baseline performance ($P(Correct | p, \\theta) \\leq \\epsilon$) for complex problems.\nComputational Complexity The computational complexity of the DID algorithm can be expressed as $O(T \\cdot (n_{ind} + n_{ded}))$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, $n_{ind}$ is the complexity of inductive reasoning per iteration, and $n_{ded}$ is the complexity of deductive reasoning per iteration. The dynamic adjustment enabled by the DID framework, as necessitated by Assumptions 1 and 2, reduces error propagation compared to static methods like CoT, thus improving efficiency and accuracy.\nEfficiency Gains By dynamically adjusting reasoning pathways according to task complexity and problem novelty, DID reduces the number of iterations required to converge on a solution. This adaptive process ensures that DID outperforms static methods like CoT in both performance and computational overhead, achieving higher accuracy with fewer computational resources.\nTheoretical adaption analysis The DID framework effectively manages cognitive load by initially focusing on simplified problem versions, allowing the model to concentrate on essential elements before engaging with more complex interactions. Through the inductive phase, the model observes specific instances, forming a foundation for generalization. As task complexity increases, the model transitions to deductive reasoning, applying generalized rules to arrive at a solution. This dynamic adjustment of reasoning strategies based on evolving task contexts enhances the model's adaptability and problem-solving efficiency.\nIntegration with Existing Models The De-In-Ductive (DID) method is compatible with various LLM architectures and can be seamlessly integrated with existing techniques such as CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022b). By providing a structured reasoning framework that dynamically incorporates both inductive and deductive reasoning, DID complements these methods and enhances the model's problem-solving capabilities. Specifically, it structures the problem-solving process to allow for the dynamic integration of reasoning strategies, utilizes a structured template prompt that guides the model through incremental reasoning stages and improves adaptability and problem-solving efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. By mirroring human adaptive reasoning processes, the DID method provides a more flexible and robust framework for LLMs to tackle complex and evolving problems."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "content": "4.1 ALICE PROBLEMS\nTask.

This result highlights the DID framework's ability to guide the model through structured, step-by-step reasoning, even in less powerful models like GPT-3.5 Turbo. Traditional prompt methods, such as IO and CoT, tend to struggle with multi-step reasoning because they either rely on direct output generation or follow static, predefined thought chains that lack the flexibility to adapt to more complex scenarios. On GPT-4o, the DID method reaches 70.27%, which far exceeds both IO (43.36%) and CoT (55.85%). The substantial margin between DID and other methods demonstrates its efficacy in managing logical deductions, particularly in more complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, the static nature of IO and the limited flexibility of CoT prevent these methods from fully addressing the intricacies of multi-step deductions. Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibits the highest overall performance across all methods, with the DID method achieving an impressive accuracy of 89.49%, further extending its lead over IO (74.77%) and CoT (83.68%).\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the DID framework excels in progressively guiding LLMs through increasingly complex reasoning steps, especially in tasks where relationships must be deduced from ambiguous information, such as determining family connections. Traditional prompt methods often fail to handle such tasks effectively because they attempt to solve the original complex problem directly, which can result in the model missing critical logical connections. This frequently leads to incorrect conclusions. By breaking down multi-step reasoning problems into simpler subproblems, the DID method ensures that the model remains on track and avoids common pitfalls.

A key factor underlying this limitation may be the fundamental architecture of LLMs. These models rely on predicting the next token in a sequence, which restricts their ability to maintain a coherent internal representation across multiple reasoning steps. While attention mechanisms allow models to reference previous tokens, they lack the robust cognitive structures that humans use to ensure logical integrity across reasoning processes. Consequently, LLMs can lose track of intermediate steps or overlook crucial logical connections, leading to errors in tasks that might otherwise appear straightforward. This token-based, output-driven mechanism, although effective in many natural language processing tasks, is inherently unsuited for tasks that require rigorous logical consistency and structured reasoning, explaining the persistence of basic mistakes in LLM outputs."}, {"title": "5.2 FINE-TUNING LLMS WITH DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE REASONING", "content": "The DID method proposed in this paper primarily focuses on prompting strategies without altering the underlying architecture or fine-tuning the LLM itself.

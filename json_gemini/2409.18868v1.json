For instance, one exciting research direction would be to search for the synergistic effects of multimodality. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no definitive finds were made on this front, despite the growing body of research on V&L model evaluation. For example, Parcalabescu et al. (2021) provide a benchmark to assess the visual grounding capabilities of V&L models. The authors conclude that current models have difficulty addressing most phenomena that require models to ground linguistic information in the visual modality. Thrush et al. (2022) present a benchmark for visio-linguistic compositional reasoning and also find that none of the modern V&L models does much better than chance.\nThis paper presents the first potential case of such visio-linguistic synergies. Namely, it studies the phenomenon of individuation and how V&L models represent objects \u2013 that is, how they distinguish objects from substances and how they track objects and their quantity in sets that contain more than one object."}, {"title": "Individuation", "content": "Individuation is generally understood as basic principles that guide the distinction between objects and substances, as well as the distinction between a single object and multiple objects. Individuation is not limited to visual modality \u2013 it applies cross-modally to stimuli of any kind. Here, we will only focus on visual individuation and its relation to the linguistic properties of corresponding words. This section summarizes the main relevant findings on individuation from cognitive science and linguistics.\nOperationally, individuation can be probed along two axes: 1) the quantity axis; 2) the object axis. The former corresponds to distinguishing and tracking individual objects as their quantity increases. The latter is the dependency between the individual properties of an object and its permeability as an object rather than a substance. We will now overview these two aspects of individuation \u2013 first, in cognition, then in language."}, {"title": "Individuation and Cognition", "content": "The quantity axis. The human ability to perceive, identify, track, and count objects generally decreases as the number of objects in a scene increases (Feigenson et al., 2004; Dehaene, 2011; Hyde, 2011). The cognitive basis of this observation is complex. In particular, two relevant cognitive systems have been identified: the object tracking system (OTS) and the approximate number system (ANS) (Carey, 1998; Spaepen et al., 2011; Spelke, 2011). OTS is active when the number of objects to track is low, typically under 3 or 4. OTS tracks each object individually and represents the exact quantity of objects in a scene. ANS, on the contrary, does not construct individual object representations and does not track the exact quantity of objects. In particular, in a cardinality comparison task in which two sets of arbitrary objects are given, the ability to tell which of the two sets has higher cardinality depends on the ratio between the sets' cardinalities. In pre-verbal infants, this ratio can be around 1:2, but it decreases somewhat with development (Hyde et al., 2010).\nSumming up, the human ability to represent objects and their quantity is not stable across quantities, with sharp contrast at the edge of OTS, and is ratio-sensitive in the ANS domain. For example, ten versus fifteen would be more distinguishable than twenty versus twenty-five even though the absolute difference between the cardinalities is the same; see (Starkey and Cooper Jr, 1980). Both systems are non-linguistic since they are present in pre-verbal humans.\nThe object axis. Humans organize their visual space into objects vs. substances very early in life, well in the pre-verbal stage of their development. (Spelke, 1990) identifies the basic principles of such an organization as Cohesion, Boundedness, Rigidity, and No Action at a Distance. Objects defined against these principles are called \u2018Spelke objects.' Such objects tend to be connected, non-overlapping, with constant spacial characteristics when moving and only affecting each other when in contact. This is not exactly the same notion of an object as found in adults: for example, under these principles, a horseman riding a horse would be considered one object with the horse.\nIndividuation principles develop and change during the lifetime, but the most drastic changes happen around the first year and coincide with language acquisition breakthroughs. Knowledge about linguistic labels for classes of objects has been argued to be used in individuation at this stage (Xu, 2007). Still, the causal relation between linguistic milestones and the changes in individuation strategies is under debate. For example, it is hard to disentangle linguistic factors from the rapid accumulation of world knowledge happening in the same period. For a deeper discussion of these factors, see (Gentner and Boroditsky, 2001), who also suggests a cognitive hierarchy of individuation as a development of 'Spelke object' principles:\nhumans < animals < vehicles < small mobile objects < complex structurally cohesive objects < amorphous"}, {"title": "Individuation and Language", "content": "Natural language shows systematic distinctions with respect to both the quantity and the object axes. These distinctions can be linked to the organization of the corresponding cognitive systems.\nThe quantity axis. Distinctions in the representation of different quantities in language grammar manifest themselves mainly in two domains: 1) number morphology; 2) morphosyntax of constructions with numerals.\nIn languages like English, morphological number distinctions give rise to a split between one object (book) and a higher number of objects (book-s; however, plural nouns can refer to singular objects as well, see Spector 2007; Zweig 2009). Some languages also have a dual grammatical number as part of the nominal number inventory, making the 1 vs. 2 vs. >2 quantity distinction in the number domain (Slovenian, Arabic, etc.). Few languages also have the trial number form (e.g., some Austronesian languages and Austronesian-influenced creoles) and paucal number form referring to a 'small' number of objects (e.g., some Oceanic languages). It's debated whether there are languages with the quadral number form. Higher grammaticalized number distinctions don't exist in natural language \u2013 for instance, there is no morphological affix as part of the grammatical number category that would mean 'exactly 7' or '15 or more'. Within the space of existing number distinctions, the higher the number line, the rarer the distinction. For example, the trial number form is quite rare typologically; dual number form is more frequent but rarer than a system with just the singular vs. plural distinction. A number hierarchy supports this observation: if a language has some number form, it also has all the number forms to the left of it (Croft, 1990; Corbett, 2000):\nsingular < plural < dual < paucal/trial\nThus, quantity distinctions built into language grammar through number marking show up exclusively on the lower side of the number line, roughly in the subitizing/OTS domain. Still, even within this domain, different quantities are not equally distinguished - the lower, the more prominent.\nConstructions with numerals (five books etc.) communicate precise quantities. The morphosyntax of such constructions varies somewhat depend-"}, {"title": "Individuation Assessment", "content": "We suggest estimating the models' individuation 'resolution' by inferring its individuation hierarchy. The pipeline we construct here is based on publicly available data and is motivated by cognitive and linguistic experiments on individuation discussed above.\nWe structure this section as follows. First, we describe the list of nouns and semantic features that we use in our experiments throughout this paper. We then propose a simple way to characterize individuation in a model. In short, we will look at embeddings of noun phrases describing various quantities of objects and measure distances"}, {"title": "Data", "content": "We start with a list of nouns alongside their plural forms. We take a publicly available list of singular-plural noun pairs based on an analysis of the Wikipedia corpus\u00b2. This list includes 93 518 words. Since we want to assess individuation across various types of entities, we need to enrich the list with semantic information. We intersect the original list with WordNet\u00b3. This procedure leaves 28 521 nouns from the original list. Now every entry has specific conceptual-semantic attributes from WordNet alongside the plural form of the word that corresponds to a given entry. We use this list for further experiments.\nWith more than twenty-eight thousand words, we believe it to be representative and adequate for the broad assessment of individuation in the models we include in the study. For some of the experiments, we filter the obtained list further, leaving several WordNet categories that generally correspond with the taxonomy of individuation hierarchy observed in studies summarized in Section 2."}, {"title": "Embedding Quantities", "content": "In the first experiment, we study quantity distinctions in CLIP. This aspect of the model's behavior is parallel to the 'quantity axis' of individuation described in Section 2 in the context of cognition and language. We will compare the model behavior with the results found in humans: we expect that a model that encodes individuation in a manner"}, {"title": "Embedding Qualitative Properties", "content": "As discussed above, individuation is sensitive to a variety of physical properties of entities, thus giving rise to something we call 'the object axis' in Section 2. These properties guide the classification of entities into substances vs. objects. Assessment along this axis enriches the results from the previous section with the other aspect of individuation.\nFigure 1 shows contrasts between different quantities averaged across all nouns denoting different types of objects. But the contrast between quantities might decline differently for various classes of nouns, therefore, showing the interaction between the two axes. One can look at the following intuitive example. The individuation scales based on results from cognitive science and linguistics predict that people are higher on those scales (= are more individuateable) than animals or plants. Thus humans might perceive the difference between five and six people as a starker one than the difference between five or six dogs or, say, apples. We suggest seeing whether some of the models in question have similar behavior.\nSince WordNet contains information on the classes of nouns, one could see if the embeddings of the model capture the qualitative properties of the mentioned classes. For this paper, we suggest the following classes: substance, food, nutrient, body part, vascular plant, woody plant, fruit, living thing, organism, fish, animal, and person. These are the classes of objects over which we would aggregate the obtained results. Naturally, one could have a less granular picture merging some similar classes, but we suggest using the original WordNet 'synset' typology to simplify reproducibility.\nHow could one characterize the individuation 'resolution' of a given model? As we have mentioned earlier, there is converging cognitive and linguistic data suggesting that individuation and"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The first thing that one sees is that FastText has almost no distinguished individuation classes and lumps a variety of classes together. It doesn't give rise to a systematic individuation hierarchy that would be similar in any way to the rankings proposed in cognitive science and linguistics. If anything, the tendency is the opposite: substances turn out to be one of the most 'individuated' classes, while animals and organisms end up on the lower end of the scale.\nThe second observation is that the hierarchies deduced from SBERT and CLIP are similar to the individuation hierarchies proposed in cognitive and linguistic research. As discussed in Section 2, the linguistic behavior of different nouns varies in ways that can be traced back to cognitive distinctions in individuation. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that a text-only model attuned to semantic distinctions that show up in distributional properties of nouns can pick up the relevant contrasts. Yet a careful exploration of Figure 2 allows us to see where additional \u2013 visual \u2013 modality helps develop clearer individuation-related distinctions compared to the language-only model."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This paper demonstrates that CLIP benefits from vision-language synergy and thus effectively encodes individuation properties for distinct entities."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "For this research, we used WordNet and CLIP.

Introduction", "content": "In the modern world, the Internet and the Internet of Things have changed how we interact and work together. As a result of IoT devices' variety and resource constraints, security has emerged as one of its most significant challenges. This enables ubiquitous computing services to be provided to end users through the interconnection of various devices monitored and controlled via the Internet. IoT is expected to undergo constant revolution over the next few years as a result of numerous constraints, including heterogeneity of devices, resource constraints, power storage, security, and data management. Several attacks are aimed at Internet and IoT-based security, including spoofing and single points of failure. Many of these attacks rely on centralized trusted authorities, making it vulnerable to many attacks. Blockchain will most likely meet the security needs of the Internet and IoT since it provides security, anonymity, and integrity without requiring third parties [1]. In this way, IoT and machine learning will form the basis of Industry 4.0. By facilitating data acquisition within an application context, the IoT is helping digitize many applications and automate business processes [2-5] through deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Around six times more data will be generated by IoT devices than their predecessors. Security and privacy protection are of the utmost importance when it comes to IoT applications that involve sensitive data. Additionally, devices are reluctant to share their data for training purposes in open environments like the Internet out of fear of being tracked. Various attackers may manipulate data shared by geographically dispersed individuals, resulting in inaccurate results. Moreover, IoT systems must be autonomous so they can make decisions based on context and learn from the data they collect. It can help recognize patterns, evaluate, process, and make intelligent judgments in such a setting using machine learning (ML). Despite this, most accessible machine learning algorithms rely on a centralized framework, which may lead to security breaches. Data manipulation, forged authentication, and privacy protection are all challenges of centralized power. The Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm also depends on data integrity to provide reliable results. Certain occurrences may be falsely identified by Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms even if there is a modest security flaw. Furthermore, for many security applications, Deep Reinforcement Learning relies on a trusted third party (TTP) (e.g., a cloud service provider) for calculations, which may compromise privacy. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm based on a decentralized architecture. Meanwhile, Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be implemented in blockchain and IoT"}, {"title": "2. Related work", "content": "Systematic Literature Review (SLR) results do not support the use of Blockchain smart contracts for protecting the Internet and IoT [6]. SLRs on Blockchain and cyber security have been performed by Hu et al. [7]. Researchers reviewed the literature to determine whether Blockchain can be used for cybersecurity purposes. Blockchain is being used for Internet and IoT security in more than half of the literature reviewed. Future projects should evaluate the potential for developing novel cybersecurity solutions using Ethereum and other Blockchain platforms. According to Sharma et al. [8], Blockchain-based systems can also be used to deliver security services in areas such as confidentiality, integrity assurance, authentication, privacy, access control, and data provenance. To distinguish between study themes, various studies related to our issue will also be discussed. Security concerns and potential solutions for the Internet of Things were categorized using a tiered taxonomy and classification system. Additionally, they examined and discussed Blockchain-based security solutions to safeguard IoT. A review of Blockchain-based applications was conducted by Billah et al. [10]. Blockchain technology and the Internet of Things were first modeled and examined. Based on the existing work on enabling Blockchain technologies, physical solutions (PSs) were defined to identify the limitations and critical areas for the implementation of Blockchain technology in large-scale, distributed settings. In order to provide IoT security assistance, three tiers of functional requirements (FRs) were identified. As a result of previous research, they categorized physical security solutions into ten categories. Most of these solutions use smart contracts to guarantee a certain level of security. Ogundokun et al. [11] reviewed blockchain-based applications across a range of fields in 2022. From supply chains to IoT, they categorize Blockchain-based applications, focusing on their limitations, which hamper their widespread adoption.\nMachine learning algorithms and methods are widely used in a variety of applications, but they have been constrained by the enormous amount of data involved in training. As the number of input parameters used to train a neural network increases, the storage and processing requirements may escalate dramatically. In problem domains where individual devices are resource-constrained, UAVs are ideal for hosting machine-learning algorithms that require large amounts of processing power. The federation notion in machine learning is illustrated realistically by Ogundokun et al. [12]. Mobile devices are used to construct machine learning models where the data exists, and TensorFlow is used to train deep neural networks from the model's individual data in the cloud [13]. Implementation challenges such as localization (time zone), device availability, and limited computing resources have been recognized and solved by the authors. A server with the updated model communicates with the devices. After model training, the device updates the model and sends it back to the server with the updated model. Federated learning activities use a protocol that is designed to be resilient to unreliable settings in terms of communication frequency, device involvement, and device selection. An analytics method allows the server to gain insights about bottlenecks and other restrictions occurring at the device's end without accessing its data. A variety of techniques were used by Chen et al. [14] to optimize machine learning. Part of the data reflected individual user behavior in the optimization of a variety of mobile devices. Their focus is optimizing and enhancing machine learning models using federated learning. The authors investigate the challenges in achieving optimal performance when using known algorithms. Distributed Approximate Newton (DANE) [15] and Stochastic Variation Reduced Gradient (SVRG) [16] are two distributed machine learning techniques.\nA typical machine learning model performs poorly in this context due to its intrinsic sequential nature. This model is updated using the parameters learned by the nodes through a communication round. There are rapid iterations in traditional algorithms. Based on experimental data, they demonstrate that it is feasible to build an algorithm that performs well in this environment despite the limitations of network capacity and obstacles such as sluggish convergence. According to Chen et al. [16], distributed machine learning had one of its most significant contributions. Specifically, they contribute mechanisms for sharing training data and workloads among several worker nodes.\nAdditionally, the proposed architecture enables the global sharing of model parameters in the form of sparse vectors between server nodes. There are billions of samples being considered here, with potentially very long feature lengths. Workers train on subsets of the whole data set, while parameter servers store copies of the most recent parameters. Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Sparse Logistic Regression are the authors' machine learning models. Thanks to a bulk communication server and message compression during parameter transmission, the system operated effectively because of reduced communication costs. Xu [17] proposes that each node executes its own training algorithm to gather datasets from distant nodes. Based on variables such as which model to use, what features to pick, and how long a given configuration will take, this system is designed to assist data pre-processing activities such as feature selection, engineering, and optimization. This concept also inspired the approach proposed in this study. To create a machine learning model that is ready for deployment, we offer this feature in our proposed framework to simulate human behavior during data preprocessing, training, and use. To enable privacy-aware federated learning, we also use blockchains to allow the trusted sharing of models and their performance indicators. In [54], Luong et al. studied DRL applications in communications and networking, focusing primarily on networking and communications issues. The use of DRL for autonomous IoT was surveyed by Lei et al. [55]. However, despite the usefulness of these studies, there are still some emerging challenges that they have not addressed. In the case of blockchain-powered IoT applications, for example, strict trust may be required. A number of optimization algorithms for network scheduling and duty cycling are then investigated by Bai et al. [56] and Wang et al. [57].\nBlockchain has recently been used to maximize the utility of machine learning algorithms in a number of noteworthy contributions. Using smart contracts to test and verify machine learning models is illustrated by Liu et al. [18]. Due to the Ethereum-based blockchain employed, users can specify a reward amount in Ethereum tokens once they upload a dataset to the blockchain. After the machine learning task is completed by the human-driven agent, the machine learning model is presented to the smart contract that certifies the answer. The contestant with the best model is awarded the prize once all competitors have successfully submitted their ideas. Machine learning preprocessing and model-fitting are automated in our case to simulate this behavior on the nodes. By submitting datasets on the blockchain and paying the top model submissions based on their performance, the authors have developed a prototype for a future marketplace where enterprises can obtain the best available machine-learning skills. Smart contracts are used to control trust and equity as well as model validation and compensation. The authors have also identified the dangers associated with cheating by model submitters and organizers and implemented smart contracts to deal with them. As an additional feature of this study, the machine learning technique has been implemented with Solidity, which is a computer language. It was necessary for the authors to incorporate several speed and memory-saving strategies, given the language's limitations."}, {"title": "3. Basics of blockchain technology", "content": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released a fictional currency called Bitcoin that was based on blockchain technology, which is widely regarded as a decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy ledger [10]. Each transaction on the blockchain is packaged into a block, which contains a certain number of transactions. Distributed blockchain ledgers are created using all verified blocks. Using the cryptographic hash code of a block, a block in the distributed ledger is connected to a previously authorized block. A variety of uses outside of digital currencies have already been explored with this developing technology. In a P2P network, members can check the behavior of other participants, create new blockchain-recorded transactions, and validate them. As a result of this architecture, blockchain operations are robust and efficient, and the risks of single points of failure are reduced. Network administrators have yet to govern the blockchain ledger, which is accessible to all participants [11-15]. In order to achieve consensus among network nodes, rigorous rules must be enforced, and strict rules must be enforced. This is known as the consensus method. In a blockchain network, consensus is the process by which all nodes sync the distributed ledger."}, {"title": "2.1. IoT and blockchain (BCIoT) in Smart City", "content": "Embedded sophisticated computers, sensors, and actuators transmit data to a centralized server, usually a Cloud server, in order to enable the IoT to connect people, things, and commodities. IoT analytics tools are used to improve corporate operations and develop new services based on IoT data. While the IoT ecosystem has a lot of potential, security and privacy are important concerns that have hindered its widespread adoption [16, 17]. It is common for IoT networks to be vulnerable to security flaws such as DDoS attacks, ransomware, and malicious attacks. In DDoS attacks, several hacked computer systems bombard a target with many simultaneous data requests, resulting in a denial of service for users. The current centralized systems may encounter bottlenecks as the number of devices connecting to an IoT network grows. DTL blockchain potentially overcomes the security, privacy, and scalability issues associated with IoT by resolving these IoT issues. A blockchain's distributed ledger can't be tampered with, so participants don't have to trust each other. Internet of Things has a wide range of applications, including smart cities, smart infrastructure, smart grids, smart transportation, and smart homes. A new blockchain domain, BCIoT, has emerged with the implementation of blockchains in the IoT domain. Data produced by IoT devices is not controlled by one organization under the BCIoT paradigm [18, 19]. Furthermore, parties can review previous transactions with blockchain technology. As a result, data leaks are identified and repaired quickly. It is becoming increasingly important to ensure the integrity of IoT source code since it is held by internet third parties and telecommunications companies. The usefulness of blockchain in IoT networks is affected by several variables [20, 21]:\n(1) In IoT applications that require a decentralized P2P ecosystem, blockchain can solve privacy and security issues.\n(2) IoT applications requiring payment processing without third-party control may benefit from blockchain technology [22].\n(3) Blockchain can be an effective solution if IoT applications require logs and traceability of sequential transactions.\nIoT devices and blockchain ledgers work well together, but there are some key obstacles to overcome.\n\u2022\tIoT sensors produce a vast amount of data that must be handled on-chain in order to integrate IoT and blockchain. Transactions on the blockchain may also be processed at lower speeds or with a higher latency.\n\u2022\tKeeping network privacy and transaction confidentiality is also key: on a public blockchain, it is not possible to ensure anonymity for transaction history. The analysis of transaction patterns can be used by attackers to discover the identities of users or devices.\nAfter reviewing the literature, we focused on IoT and blockchain to address the issue mentioned above. An integrated architecture of IoT and blockchain architecture is demonstrated in the following figure (figure 3):"}, {"title": "2.2. Blockchain and Cloud of Things (BCCoT)", "content": "As digitalization improves, health institutions and patients exchange a growing number of electronic medical records (EMRs), enabling data collection and enhancing the quality of treatment for patients. Using cloud computing, patients may remotely access their Electronic Health Records (EHR) on their mobile devices, and EHRs can be remotely processed on Cloud servers. With IoT and Cloud computing, therapy may be supplied on demand, medical costs can be decreased, and care quality can be enhanced [21, 22]. Despite this, cloud-based storage, Cloud suppliers, and users are not fully trusted to exchange data in Cloud contexts. In addition to deteriorating medical services and networks, this causes serious data leakage issues. Due to the immutability, stability, and reliability of blockchain technology, exchanging health information in cloud ecosystems presents obstacles [23]. Blockchain and Cloud can secure data sharing and are significant contributors to controlling user access and data sharing in Cloud IoT-enabled healthcare networks. Using smart contracts on the blockchain, unsafe healthcare environments may be regulated and authorized automatically, assuring their security. To secure a high level of data privacy and security, blockchain models promote participation by patients and healthcare organizations. When blockchain is used with cloud computing, eHealth cloud storage services are substantially more secure. Under blockchain management, cloud storage functions as peers inside the P2P network. Researchers have proposed encrypting and storing health data in normal cloud storage while storing the hash code created from metadata on the blockchain. This will allow cloud data traceability and rapid change detection. Healthcare services can be delivered more efficiently, dependably, and productively with blockchain technology. Using blockchain technology to monitor patient health, diagnose patients, and evaluate therapeutic procedures could revolutionize the clinical sector. Thus, blockchain models will contribute to the transformation of healthcare delivery into a more secure and efficient procedure [123-125].\nSmart city applications can benefit from blockchain's superior security features. In addition to providing sophisticated computational capabilities, cloud computing allows individuals to provide services in real-time based on huge data streams from IoT applications. Smart cities can benefit from blockchain's high-security characteristics when managing operations [7, 3]. Smart city designs can address performance and security issues with blockchain and cloud computing. Home monitoring, home management, and device access control are some of the smart home services provided by blockchain systems. Data storage and processing between IoT devices, homeowners, and external users may be more scalable and efficient using Blockchain and distributed Cloud computing. In the present IoT systems, the massive amount of data transmitted from several devices causes a bottleneck due to the limited power and storage capacities of IoT devices [27, 28]. Today, most data storage and processing are done in a central database. There are several disadvantages to a centralized repository:\n(1) Consumers would not be able to access services during the outage since a single server handles all user requests.\n(2) Businesses that manage centralized storage mediums may disclose unencrypted data to unauthorized individuals [29], placing the data owner's privacy at risk.\n(3) It is possible for the database to be modified from the server without the data owner's knowledge or consent [7, 30].\nCloud computing, however, can provide IoT services on-demand, dependable, and secure due to its nearly limitless storage and processing capabilities. Blockchain, IoT, and cloud computing create a new paradigm, BCCoT, which secures the operation of apps. Cloud-based resources are extremely beneficial to IoT frameworks. Real-world applications may also become more prominent due to Cloud's integration with IoT ecosystems. A Cloud of Things system could also lead to a more efficient, effective, and high-quality IoT system with little management effort. There are several IoT processes that can be supported by cloud-based analytical tools, including the processing of historical data, storing and analyzing information, and analyzing statistical data. Cloud data management is used to enhance IoT services and meet consumer needs. The Internet of Things (IoT) has many key characteristics, such as ubiquitous connectivity, on-demand assistance, high processing capacity, and scalability [31,32]. To combine blockchain, the Internet of Things, and Cloud of Things technologies, academics have designed a variety of frameworks."}, {"title": "2-3-Nexus of machine learning, blockchain, and IIoT", "content": "Blockchain systems can be classified as public [14], consortium [15], or private [16]. Their distinctions are illustrated in the following table. All data stored on a public blockchain is accessible to the public. The data on public blockchains is open to all, so anyone can read, write, and see it. As a result, blockchains can be utilized in areas such as healthcare. Compared to public blockchains, private blockchains are often used inside organizations and are not publicly accessible [33, 34]. The public cannot access private blockchains. Blockchains that are administered by companies are called private blockchains. In a private blockchain environment, records can be kept securely, audited, and tampered with. Since public blockchains are less regulated than private ones, validation and storing transactions take less time. Transaction speeds on private blockchains may rival those on traditional databases [34-39]. Due to the normal safe network environment, a limited number of nodes may be trusted. A private blockchain can be used for manufacturing, for example. Blockchain consortiums are hybrids of public and private blockchains, although they are more closely related to private distributed ledgers. Businesses using \"semi-private\" systems have restricted access to them. It is both more expensive and time-consuming to administer traditional Internet of Things applications due to centralized administration. IIoT challenges will be alleviated by the deployment of blockchain technology because of the rapid proliferation of IoT devices. Each node in a blockchain network functions as a peer node, so there are no additional protocols required for peer-to-peer interactions [33]. By eliminating the requirement to convey transaction information to third parties, a blockchain system allows peer-to-peer data sharing. By storing redundant data on the blockchain, multiple nodes (peers) can preserve data integrity and provide flexibility for IoT systems. It may be possible to make an IoT system more adaptable and interoperable with a variety of devices and data formats by using blockchain technology. As a result, the IIoT is equipped with vast amounts of data that are tailored to certain business needs, like privacy and transparency. In order to build and deploy deep learning and reinforcement learning methods, as well as to sustain and automate business processes, data availability is imperative [34-39]."}, {"title": "2-3-1- Supervised Learning", "content": "It involves labeling both input data as well as targeted output data for classification in supervised learning. Future data processing will be based on this learning base. There are a number of key algorithms for supervised learning, including:\n1- The k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach involves classifying data samples according to their neighbor's labels. The average measurements of neighboring IoT devices within a specific range are typically calculated using simple methods (e.g., the Euclidean distance between the devices). In large data sets, it may not be accurate due to the simplicity of the computation algorithm. k-NNs are used in IoT to detect faults and aggregate data.\n2- To define decision boundaries in SVM approaches, decision planes are used. As a result of its high accuracy, SVM supervised learning is typically used for localization problems in IoT and WSN in order to detect malicious behaviors.\n3- Artificial neural network (ANN): A neural network consists of layers of artificial neurons that are interconnected to mimic the function of biological neurons. As a result of these artificial neurons, different sets of input data are mapped to a set of output data. Although artificial neurons provide solutions to non-linear and complex problems, they are computationally intensive. IoT localization is improved by artificial neural networks.\n4- A relatively small number of samples is used for training Bayesian inference, unlike most machine learning algorithms. Adapting probability distributions and avoiding overfitting are the hallmarks of Bayesian learning. They are effective at learning uncertain perceptions. It is necessary, however, for them to be familiar with the environment beforehand. Detecting faults, selecting cluster heads, and localizing clusters can be accomplished with Bayesian interfaces.\n5- These decision-support tools use DT (Decision Tree) models to make decisions or classify items. If-then conditions are used to create DTs. A random forest algorithm (RF) is used to improve DT accuracy. The RF method consists of constructing multiple classifiers as part of an ensemble decision tree. Decision trees are the basis of each classifier."}, {"title": "3. Reinforcement learning", "content": "A decision-making agent using RL actively interacts with its uncertainty during the decision-making process. Dynamic programming extension and MDP are also known as MDP. For closed-loop problems, RL is the answer; closed-loop inputs affect subsequent system outputs. There are no known transition functions or reward functions in this method, unlike the MDP. A RL system consists of the following components:\n\u2022\tIn RL, the primary component is an agent that seeks goals in an uncertain environment and interacts with it.\n\u2022\tThe environment is everything with which the agent interacts. The environment has certain features and attributes. In each state, the agent senses and evaluates these attributes. Agents use this information to choose actions that could influence outcomes.\n\u2022\tThe state of the environment has a direct relationship with actions that can be taken based on it. Searches, functions, and lookup matrices are all options.\n\u2022\tA reward signal defines the goal of a problem. Depending on the agent's current state and action, the environment sends the agent a single value every time step. The reward is this value. It can be positive or negative. This reward is the sole objective of the agent.\n\u2022\tState functions are defined as value functions. Using this state as a starting point and accumulating rewards over time, the agent is said to have collected a value of the state. In order to estimate the values of the agents, iterations are performed over the sequences of observations."}, {"title": "3.1. Deep reinforcement learning", "content": "In order to maximize its cumulative benefit, an agent frequently performs high-reward actions from one state to another. In addition, the activity itself is associated with greedy behavior. An agent is investigating whether it chooses an action for transitioning from one state to another about which it has limited or no knowledge. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms are employed to understand this behavior further, leveraging neural networks to approximate complex action-value functions. By using these algorithms, agents are able to make informed decisions even in high-dimensional state spaces typical of IoT environments in smart cities. Simulation of numerous interactions within a digital twin of the indoor model allows the agent to refine its strategy, balancing exploration of unknown states with exploitation of known, high-reward actions. In dynamic environments where new data continuously influence the agent's knowledge base, this balance is imperative for optimizing long-term results. In addition, the integration of collaborative computing enhances the efficiency of DRL in indoor modeling. In the IoT network, agents share insights and strategies, collectively improving policies through a distributed learning process. In addition to accelerating the learning curve, this collaborative approach ensures robustness against isolated errors or suboptimal actions by individual agents. This results in a safer and more efficient indoor environment, which can react quickly to changes and potential threats. Creating responsive and intelligent smart city infrastructure is made possible by this synergy between deep reinforcement learning and collaborative IoT computing. It is possible to give a gift that is far more valuable! Currently, an investigation is being conducted. Alfandi et al. [40] define RL as the balance between utilizing the familiar and exploring the unfamiliar. DL boosts RL's decision-making ability when circumstances require it. According to Mnih et al. [41], DRL played Atari 2600 video games extremely fast and effectively."}, {"title": "3.2. Evaluation metrics for reinforcement learning", "content": "A qualitative comparison of RL algorithms in the fields we examined relies on three primary assessment measures.\n1. As a performance criterion, the accuracy of authentication is crucial. Metric values used to determine authentication accuracy include.\na. An invalid user's chances of being accepted are measured by the False Acceptance Rate (FAR).\nb. A Missed Detection Rate (MDR) indicates how likely it is that an invalid user will be missed.\n2. Computing performance is influenced by time complexity and time cost. Efficiency is demonstrated by taking less time. There is a reference to greed in an earlier section. As a result of the RL algorithm's computational efficiency, it is considered greedy. An algorithm that selects actions based on their reward is said to be greedy. A learning algorithm may be myopic if it considers an immediate reward. In an ideal situation, greedy action selection would result in the selection of a longer and more advantageous route. It is common for processing efficiency to include storage space efficiency in many applications because most IoT applications operate in resource-constrained environments.\n3. Convergence Time - In our previous article, we discussed the role of time as a factor in computer efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to describe the convergence time of a particular RL algorithm. It is likely that an RL agent will conduct thousands, if not millions, of experiments and actions before it reaches optimum learning. It would be ideal if a model could minimize the number of steps needed to reach convergence and interact less with the environment. RL algorithms can be compared using a variety of quantitative metrics."}, {"title": "4.

Our literature review combines reinforcement learning, IoT, and cybersecurity [40-45].

Moreover, the Congressional Cybersecurity Committee is studying blockchain technology as a possible cyberattack remedy after a recent ransomware attack on the New York Times and BBC. Despite the lack of regulation, blockchain has been used illegally in a variety of shady trade platforms, such as Silk, which is no longer operational. Due to blockchain's decentralized nature, conventional legislation cannot regulate it. Zahid et al. [48] described blockchain as a transformative mechanism from \"Code is a law\" to \"Law is Code.\" Smart contracts can be used to codify laws on the blockchain. It is possible to make law a product by using blockchain smart contracts. According to Baracaldo et al. [49], knowledge-based economies require tax, financial, and social regulation mechanisms. Blockchain and fog computing require an effective regulatory structure, they said. Effective regulation and oversight are necessary for blockchain technology to be viable and applicable. All internet applications can be adequately controlled by legislation, social norms, and economic means, according to Sun [50]. A Blockchain-based Internet of Things application can be efficiently governed by combining these four methods. The present blockchain applications are not regulated by any laws. Using IoT-oriented smart agents, social norms can be defined, and rules can be applied to blockchain applications so that they can be monitored and controlled."}, {"title": "5.2.

It is also recommended that researchers investigate cooperative PHY-layer authentication systems in mobile WSNs and other networks of this type [52]. It has been rare to discuss the assignment of access to resources. Further investigation and assessment of the applicability and implementation of this topic are needed. As IoT and other technologies have been implemented over the last five years, RL has been investigated [52]. A few researchers are incorporating RL into existing technologies like cybersecurity. There are few articles available on authentication and real-time learning. RL and cybersecurity patents were discovered by the authors during their research for this study. China accounted for most patents. Future studies will incorporate this knowledge, according to the authors [53]."}, {"title": "6. Discussion", "content": "Several benefits are associated with RL-based intelligent systems, including their cost-effectiveness, resilience, ubiquitous nature, and dynamic functionality. In closing, it is important to keep in mind the main objective of this project: identifying research topics and cutting-edge methodologies for various aspects of cybersecurity using RL. Cybersecurity has been the subject of several models and algorithms. In order to present the applications of RL algorithms in cybersecurity, we classified them into three categories. Throughout this review, we examine a wide range of IDS, IPS, IoT, and IAM reinforcement learning applications. In recent years, RL has been used in IDS classifiers and anomaly detectors. Several datasets were analyzed in this study in order to train RL-based IDS and IPS systems. We evaluated and analyzed current approaches across a variety of applications using our assessment criteria. As a result of our comprehensive analysis, we have proposed a series of open questions and suggestions for future research. By combining RL with other approaches, such as blockchain, deep neural networks, and fuzzy logic, the problem of vast, cumbersome state spaces can be solved. The result is an increase in productivity. In comparison with particle swarm optimization, RL can save 22.75% of energy for autonomous vehicle routing. In future research articles, it would be worthwhile to investigate how DRL can be used to reduce computation time and convergence time. In addition, we evaluated further polls that suggested that RL could be used to address challenges related to large-scale deployments. A zero-trust architecture for RL applications and a safe authentication method should also be investigated. Research and inquiry in reinforcement learning encompass a wide range of topics, including authentication, access management, blockchain, fuzzy logic, privacy preservation, and fuzzy heuristic evaluation. A future scope presents detailed recommendations for researchers seeking to improve the security, fail-safety, stability, intuitiveness, and human-likeness of reinforcement learning-based models. We have further categorized the existing literature on blockchain-integrated IoT systems into three main categories based on our review (papers published until 2024): Security & Privacy, Scalability and Efficiency, and Network Management. Blockchains are used to ensure secure transactions and communications in IoT networks, eliminating the need for trusted third parties. Additionally, blockchain ensures data integrity and provenance by tracing data back through an immutable ledger and ensuring transparency and reliability. Providing robust protection against data tampering and unauthorized access, these measures address fundamental security concerns in IoT environments. Figure 7 illustrates how scalability and efficiency aim to improve resource allocation, energy management, and decentralized communication within IoT systems. As a result of blockchain technology, resources can be managed more efficiently and utilized more efficiently. A blockchain system ensures that records of energy consumption and distribution are transparent and tamper-proof. By decentralizing data processing and management, decentralized communication reduces latency and improves the scalability of IoT networks. Decentralized communication leads to more efficient and responsive systems. In order to enhance the performance and security of the Internet of Things, network management combines blockchain technology with edge and fog computing. Integrating real-time data processing closer to the data source reduces latency and improves efficiency. A fog computing approach is particularly useful in smart cities and IoT-enabled environments since it supports the decentralization of data processing and storage, thus improving the security, latency, availability, and reliability of the overall system [24-26]."}]}

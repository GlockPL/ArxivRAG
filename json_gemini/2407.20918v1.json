A general novel framework for considering belief change is the framework of belief change operators for epistemic spaces (Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez 2022). In this framework, belief change happens on a specific defined set of epistemic states. The belief change operators are global mathematical objects that define how each state changes in the light of arbitrary new information. An advantage of this framework is that it recognizes the varying nature of epistemic states of individual agents, which is given, e.g., due to the individual capabilities of the agents. Many other frameworks do not allow such a differentiation, because they (implicitly) assume that all belief sets are available.\nIn this paper, we study the realizability of belief change operators: the question of whether there exists a belief change operator that satisfies a given set of postulates under a given set of assumptions. This problem been addressed for many types of belief change operators in various frameworks (Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2018; Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald 2022; Ribeiro et al. 2013) and are an ongoing research sub- ject, but has been not considered for the expressive framework of epistemic spaces.\nThe generality of the framework for epistemic spaces and the global nature of belief change operators in this framework has consequences for the problem of realizability. To check realizability, one must consider all belief changes on all epistemic states (available in the considered epistemic space) together and decide if all those belief changes do not interfere with each other. This is different to deliberations about the realizability of belief change operators considered in many other frameworks, where a realizability is about the changes in one particular belief set or sequences of changes.\nIn the following, we list the main content of this paper, which also includes the main contributions of this submission:\n\u2022 [Non-Existence] Our first observation is that AGM revision and AGM contraction operators (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) for epistemic states (Darwiche and Pearl 1997) do not exist in all epistemic spaces. Furthermore, the corresponding epistemic spaces do not coincide.\n\u2022 [Realizability of Revision and Contraction] A precise characterization of those epistemic spaces is given, where any AGM revision operators, respectively, any AGM contraction operators, exist at all.\n\u2022 [Realizability of Operators] We consider then realizability of concrete belief revision and contraction operator approaches: full meet, maxichoice (Alchourron and Makinson 1982) and newly defined linear change operators. For contraction, we obtain the realizability of all these operators coincides with realizability of contraction. When considering realizability of revision operators, we observe that realizability of general revision, linear revision and maxichoice revision coincide. For full meet revision the realizibility is different.\n\u2022 [Non-Interdefinability of Revision and Contraction] A consequence of our investigation is that there are epistemic space where one of AGM revision and AGM contraction is realizable and the other type of operator not. This shows that in some epistemic spaces revision and contraction are not interdefinable, which is an extension to a result obtained by Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2017).\nWe have proofs for all results given in this paper, which can be found in the accompanied supplementary material."}, {"title": "Propositional Logic, Minima and Orders", "content": "Let \u2211 = {a, b, c, . . . } be a finite set of propositional atoms and let L be a propositional language over \u03a3.

In this work, we model agents by the means of logic. Deductive closed sets of formulas, which we denote from now as belief set, represent deductive capabilities; agents are assumed to be perfect reasoners. The interpretations represent worlds that the agent is capable to imagine. The following notion describes the space of epistemic possibilities of an agent's mind in a general way.\nDefinition 1 (Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez 2022; adapted). A tuple E = (E, Bel) is called an epistemic space if E is a non-empty set and Bel : E \u2192 CBel.\nWe call the elements of E epistemic states and use [] as shorthand for [Bel(\u03a8)]. Definition 1 differs from the definition given by Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez (2022) insofar that we do not exclude inconsistent belief sets and forbid emptiness of E. Belief change operators for an epistemic space E are global objects, functions on all epistemic states in the mathematical sense.\nDefinition 2. Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. A belief change operator for E is a function * : E \u00d7 L \u2192 E.\nIn general, operators from Definition 2 could behave arbitrarily, and, of course, for considering revision and contraction, we have to add additional constraints, which we will consider in the following.\nAGM Belief Revision for Epistemic Spaces. Revision operators incorporating new beliefs into an agent's belief set, consistently, whenever this is possible. We use an adaption of the AGM postulates for revision (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) for epistemic states (Darwiche and Pearl 1997), which is inspired by the approach of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992).\nDefinition 3. Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. A belief change operator * for E is called an (AGM) revision operator for E if the following postulates are satisfied (Darwiche and Pearl 1997):\n(R1) \u03b1 \u2208 Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1)\n(R2) Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) = Bel(\u03a8) + \u03b1 if Bel(\u03a8) + \u03b1 is consistent\n(R3) If \u03b1 is consistent, then Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) is consistent\n(R4) If \u03b1 |= \u03b2, then Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) = Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b2)\n(R5) Bel(\u03a8 * (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2)) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) + \u03b2\n(R6) If Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) + \u03b2 is consistent, then Bel(\u03a8 * \u03b1) + \u03b2 \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 * (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2))\nAGM revision is well-known for aiming at establishing a minimal change of the prior beliefs when revising. This is carried mainly by (R2) with respect to the beliefs of an agent. Moreover, (R5) and (R6) are postulates about rational choice that ensure relational minimal change (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985; Katsuno and Mendelzon 1992; Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2018); an interpretation that is also used in other areas (Sen 1971). For a detailed discussion of the postulates (R1)\u2013(R6) we refer to G\u00e4rdenfors (1988). In the remaining parts of this paper, we sometimes write revision operator instead of AGM revision operator.\nAGM Belief Contraction for Epistemic Spaces. Contraction is the process of withdrawing beliefs, without adding new beliefs. Postulates for AGM contraction (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) where adapted by Caridroit, Konieczny, and Marquis (2015) to the setting of propositional logic. An adapted version of these postulates for AGM contraction operators for epistemic spaces from Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2017) is given in the following.\nDefinition 4 (Adapted, Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2017). Let E= (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. A belief change operator \u00f7 for E is called an (AGM) contraction operator for E if the following postulates are satisfied:\n(C1) Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8)\n(C2) If \u03b1 \u2209 Bel(\u03a8), then Bel(\u03a8) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1)\n(C3) If \u03b1 \u2260 T, then \u03b1 \u2209 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1)\n(C4) Bel(\u03a8) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1) + \u03b1\n(C5) If \u03b1 |= \u03b2, then Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1) = Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b2)\n(C6) Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1) \u2229 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b2) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2))\n(C7) If \u03b2 \u2209 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2)), then Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 (\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2)) \u2286 Bel(\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b2)\nAs in the case of revision, AGM contraction is well-known for aiming at establishing a minimal change of the prior beliefs when contracting, which is carried mainly by (C1), (C2), (C6) and (C7). Again, we refer to G\u00e4rdenfors (1988) for a detailed discussion of the postulates (C1)\u2013(C7). In the remaining parts of this paper we sometimes write contraction operator instead of AGM contraction operator."}, {"title": "Realizability of Contraction Operators", "content": "We define realizability of AGM contraction as notion that captures whether there is any contraction operator.\nDefinition 5 (Contraction Realizability). We say that AGM contraction is realizable in an epistemic space E, if there exists an AGM contraction operator for E.\nThe following proposition fully captures those epistemic spaces E for which an AGM contraction operator for E exists.\nTheorem 6.

Clearly, Theorem 6 implies that contraction operators do not exist in every epistemic space. For specific types of contraction operators, the realizability could be even more strict. To that end, we now define some basic types of contraction operators for epistemic states that are inspired by classical approaches to contraction (Hansson 1999)."}, {"title": "Realizability of Revision Operators", "content": "Now, we will determine the conditions of realizability of revision operators and specific types of revision operators.

Figuratively, (ZR1) describes that the agent is capable of imagining that the \"real world\" is as described by exactly one interpretation; (ZR2) describes that if an agent can consider a set of interpretations as possible, then this is true for every subset thereof. A consequence of Theorem 12 is that there are epistemic spaces where no revision operator exist at all.\nAs for contraction, we define types of revision operators, for which we will also consider the realizability.\nDefinition 13.

As observed at first by Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2017), revision and contraction operators over epistemic spaces are not interdefinable in general.\nProposition 18 (Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2017). There is an epistemic space E such that there exist more\u00b9 revision operators for E than contraction operators for E.\nThe results of this paper allow further remarks to the matter of interdefinability of revision and contraction. First, observe that EE15 from Example 15 contains the epistemic state \u03a8\u03b1b with [\u03a8\u03b1b] = {\u03b1b}, yet there is no epistemic state \u03a8 \u2208 E such that [\u03a8] = {\u03b1b, \u0101b} holds. Hence, due to Theorem 6, there is no contraction operator for EE15; showing that the situation can be more drastic than Proposition 18 suggests.\nProposition 19. AGM contraction is not realizable in EE15, but AGM revision is realizable in EE15.\nMoreover, in specific epistemic spaces a situation that is dual to Proposition 18 appears, as witnessed by Example 9.\nProposition 20. AGM revision is not realizable in EE9, but AGM contraction is realizable in EE9.\nWe obtain the following dual to Proposition 18.\nCorollary 21. There is an epistemic space E such that there exist more contraction operators for E than revision operators for E."}, {"title": "Conclusion and Discussion", "content": "In this paper, we considered the problem of realizability for AGM revision and AGM contraction in epistemic spaces. Next, we highlight and discuss some of this paper's results, outline a plan for future work, and identify open problems.\nRealizability and Canonical Operators. The main results, Theorem 6 and Theorem 12, show that AGM revision and AGM contraction, are only realizable in specific epistemic spaces. Our results support that for epistemic spaces, linear contraction and linear revision are conical instances, as they are guaranteed to exist when the respective kind of belief change is realizable at all (Proposition 10 and Proposition 17).\nWe want to highlight that the observation that linear revisions are a canonical form of revision for epistemic spaces is converse to the observations made when generalizing AGM revision to arbitrary Tarskian logics, where full meet revision operators always exist and, thus, are canonical instances for AGM revision (Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald 2022). Not that the setting considered here is more general than in (Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald 2022), as, e.g., a closure under conjunction over the available epistemic states is not assumed. Our results on realizability are also different from those of Ribeiro et al. (2013), who investigated which logics AGM revision and AGM contraction operators exist. Still, they did not consider the restrictions given by considering epistemic spaces, which leads to different results.\nPotential Application. We predict that our realizability results can be used, for instance, to checking beforehand, whether AGM revision or AGM contraction can be applied out of the box in a specific domain. Another application are algorithms that compute, for a given epistemic space E, whether a revision or contraction operator for E exists.\nLinear Contraction and Linear Revision. Note that linear contraction and linear revision are novel types of operators, which make sense when considering the setting of epistemic spaces. Before us, Herzig, Konieczny, and Perrussel (2003) already employed linear orders to define belief change operators. However, the difference is that they did not employ linear orders to specify the global behaviour of operators as we did here in Section 4 and Section 5; their definition corresponds to what is here called maxichoice.\nFuture Work and Open Problems. In future work, we extend our investigations of revision and contraction constrained by iteration postulates (Sauerwald, Kern-Isberner, and Beierle 2020; Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez 2022; Darwiche and Pearl 1997). We are also planning to consider the exact relation of belief change in epistemic spaces to hyper-intensional belief revision (Souza and Wassermann 2022; Berto 2019; \u00d6zg\u00fcn and Berto 2021) and to belief change in subclassical logics, for which abstract logic (Lewitzka and Brunner 2009) will be useful, as well as the work by Flouris (Flouris 2006; Flouris and Plexousakis 2006) and results in the understanding of revision in Horn logic (Delgrande and Peppas 2015). As highlighted in this paper, another interesting problem to study is the interrelation of revision and contraction in epistemic spaces. The interested reader may consult Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2017) and Booth and Chandler (2019) as a starting point. An open problem for the area of (iterated) belief change is to consider more expressive logics and explore what are reasonable belief changes in these settings. The notion of epistemic spaces might be useful for such endeavours. We expect that our realizability results carry over to more expressive settings, and we plan to check whether this conjecture holds."}, {"title": "A Supplementary Material", "content": "A.1 Background\nIn this section, we present some background results that we need for the proofs in the next section.\nA semantic characterization of AGM contraction is epistemic spaces is by faithful assignments.\nDefinition 22 (Adapted, Darwiche and Pearl, 1997). Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. A faithful assignment for E is a function * \u2192 \u2264 that maps each epistemic state \u03a8 \u2208 E to a total preorder \u2264\u03c8 \u2286 \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9 over \u03a9 such that [\u03a8] \u2260 \u2205 implies [\u03a8] = min(\u03a9, \u2264\u03c8).\nWe link contraction operators and faithful assignments by a notion of compatibility.\nDefinition 23 (Adapted, Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald, 2022). Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space and let \u00f7 be a belief change operator for E. A faithful assignment \u03a8 \u2192 \u2264\u03c8 (for E) is called contraction-compatible with \u00f7 if the following holds:\n[\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1] = [\u03a8] \u222a min([\u00ac\u03b1], \u2264\u03c8) (contraction-compatible)\nA characterization in terms of total preorders on epistemic states is given by the following proposition.\nProposition 24 (Adapted, Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2017). Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space and let \u00f7 be a belief change operator for E. We have that \u00f7 is a contraction operator for E if and only if there is a faithful assignment \u03a8 \u2192 \u2264\u03c8 for E which is contraction-compatible with \u00f7.\nA.2 Proofs\nIn this section, we present proofs for the novel results in our paper.\nTheorem 6. Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. AGM contraction is realizable in E if and only if E satisfies:\n(ZC) For each \u03a8 \u2208 E and for each M \u2286 \u03a9 with [\u03a8] \u2286 M there exists \u03a8\u039c \u2208 E such that [\u03a8\u039c] = M.\nProof. We start by showing that the existence of \u00f7 implies satisfaction of (ZC). For each w \u2208 \u03a9 let \u03c6\u03c9 be a formula such that [\u03c9] = \u03a9 \\ {\u03c9} holds. Let \u03a8 \u2208 E be an arbitrary epistemic state and M \u2286 \u03a9 be such that [\u03a8] \u2286 M holds. In the following let M \\ [\u03a8] = {\u03c91, . . . , \u03c9n}. Using Proposition 24 we obtain that \u03a8\u039c = (((\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03c6\u03c91) \u00f7 \u03c6\u03c92) . . .) \u00f7 \u03c6\u03c9n is an epistemic state with [\u03a8\u039c] = M.\nFor the remaining direction, let E be a (non-empty) set of epistemic states that satisfies (ZC). We construct a linear contraction operator for E. Let \u226a be an arbitrary linear order on \u03a9, and for each \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 let \u03a8{\u03c9} denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from E such that [\u03a8{\u03c9}] = [\u03a8] \u222a {\u03c9}. Let \u00f7 be the belief change operator for E given as follows:\n\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1 = {  \u03a8  if \u03b1 \u2209 Bel(\u03a8) \n  \u03a8min([\u00ac\u03b1],\u226a)  otherwise\nBecause E satisfies (ZC), we have that for each \u03a8 \u2208 E and \u03b1 \u2208 L the epistemic state \u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1 exists, i.e., \u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1 \u2208 E. Now let \u2264\u03c8 be defined for each \u03a8 \u2208 E as follows:\n\u2264\u03c8 = (\u226a \\ (\u03a9 \u00d7 [\u03a8])) \u222a ([\u03a8] \u00d7 \u03a9).\nIndeed, \u03a8 \u2192 \u2264 is a faithful assignment. Moreover, \u03a8 \u2192 \u2264 is contraction-compatible with \u00f7. By Proposition 24, we obtain that \u00f7 is a contraction operator for E.\nProposition 10. Let E be an epistemic space. The following statements are equivalent:\n(I) AGM contraction is realizable in E.\n(II) There exists a linear contraction operator \u00f7 for E.\n(III)There exists a maxichoice contraction operator \u00f7 for E.\n(IV) There exists a full meet contraction operator \u00f7 for E.\nProof. Clearly, if one of the Statements (II)\u2013(IV) holds, we immediately obtain Statement (I). For Statement (I) implies Statement (II), observe that the operator \u00f7 constructed in the proof of Theorem 6 is a linear contraction operator. Moreover, because any linear contraction operator is also a maxichoice contraction, we obtain that Statement (II) implies Statement (III). We show that Statement (I) implies Statement (IV). Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space that satisfies (ZC). We construct a full meet contraction operator for E. For each M \u2286 \u03a9 let \u03a8M denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from E such that [\u03a8M] = [\u03a8] \u222a M, which exists due to the courtesy of (ZC). Let \u00f7 be the belief change operator for E given as follows:\n\u03a8 \u00f7 \u03b1 = {  \u03a8  if \u03b1 \u2209 Bel(\u03a8) \n  \u03a8[\u03b1]  otherwise\nThe operator \u00f7 is AGM contraction operator for E because when using the flat order \u2264\u03c8 = \u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9 for every epistemic state \u03a8 \u2208 E, one obtains that \u03a8 \u2192 \u2264 is a faithful assignment contraction-compatible with \u00f7.\nGiven the above-mentioned insights on \u00f7, one can easily check that the conditions for full meet are given in Definition 7 are met by \u00f7.\nTheorem 12. Let E = (E, Bel) be an epistemic space. AGM revision is realizable in E if and only if E satisfies:\n(ZR1) For all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 there is some \u03a8\u03c9 \u2208 E with [\u03a8\u03c9] = {\u03c9}.\n(ZR2) For all \u03a8 \u2208 E and for all M \u2286 [\u03a8] there exists \u03a8\u039c \u2208 E with [\u03a8\u039c] = M.\nProof. We start by showing that the existence of * implies satisfaction of (ZR1) and (ZR2). From satisfaction of (R1) and (R3) we obtain satisfaction of (ZR1). Therefore, pick an arbitrary epistemic state \u03a8 \u2208 E and a formula \u03c9 such that [\u03c9] = {\u03c9}. Because of (R1) and (R3) there exists some epistemic state \u03a8 \u2208 E such that [\u03c9] = {\u03c9} and \u03a8 * \u03c6\u03c9 = \u03a8\u03c9. For satisfaction of (ZR2) consider some \u03a8 \u2208 E. For each M \u2286 [\u03a8] let \u03a8M be such that [\u03a8M] = M. Clearly, because of (R2), revision of \u03a8 by M yields an epistemic state \u03a8 * M such that [\u03a8 * M] = M is satisfied.\nFor the remaining direction, let E be a (non-empty) set of epistemic states that satisfies (ZR1) and (ZR2). Let \u226a be an arbitrary linear order on \u03a9 and for each M \u2208 \u03a9 let \u03a8M denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from E such that"}]}

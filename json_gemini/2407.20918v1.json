A general novel framework for considering belief change is the framework of belief change operators for epistemic spaces (Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez 2022). In this framework, belief change happens on a specific defined set of epistemic states. The belief change operators are global mathematical objects that define how each state changes in the light of arbitrary new information. An advantage of this framework is that it recognizes the varying nature of epistemic states of individual agents, which is given, e.g., due to the individual capabilities of the agents. Many other frameworks do not allow such a differentiation, because they (implicitly) assume that all belief sets are available.\nIn this paper, we study the realizability of belief change operators: the question of whether there exists a belief change operator that satisfies a given set of postulates under a given set of assumptions. This problem been addressed for many types of belief change operators in various frameworks (Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2018; Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald 2022; Ribeiro et al. 2013) and are an ongoing research sub-ject, but has been not considered for the expressive framework of epistemic spaces.\nThe generality of the framework for epistemic spaces and the global nature of belief change operators in this framework has consequences for the problem of realizability. To check realizability, one must consider all belief changes on all epistemic states (available in the considered epistemic space) together and decide if all those belief changes do not interfere with each other. This is different to deliberations about the realizability of belief change operators considered in many other frameworks, where a realizability is about the changes in one particular belief set or sequences of changes.\nIn the following, we list the main content of this paper, which also includes the main contributions of this submission:\n\u2022 [Non-Existence] Our first observation is that AGM revision and AGM contraction operators (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) for epistemic states (Darwiche and Pearl 1997) do not exist in all epistemic spaces. Furthermore, the corresponding epistemic spaces do not coincide.\n\u2022 [Realizability of Revision and Contraction] A precise characterization of those epistemic spaces is given, where any AGM revision operators, respectively, any AGM contraction operators, exist at all.\n\u2022 [Realizability of Operators] We consider then realizability of concrete belief revision and contraction operator approaches: full meet, maxichoice (Alchourron and Makinson 1982) and newly defined linear change operators. For contraction, we obtain the realizability of all these operators coincides with realizability of contraction. When considering realizability of revision operators, we observe that realizability of general revision, linear revision and maxichoice revision coincide. For full meet revision the realizibility is different.\n\u2022 [Non-Interdefinability of Revision and Contraction] A consequence of our investigation is that there are epistemic space where one of AGM revision and AGM contraction is realizable and the other type of operator not. This shows that in some epistemic spaces revision and contraction are not interdefinable, which is an extension to a result obtained by Konieczny and P\u00e9rez (2017).\nWe have proofs for all results given in this paper, which can be found in the accompanied supplementary material."}, {"title": "Propositional Logic, Minima and Orders", "content": "Let $\\Sigma = \\{a, b, c, . . . \\}$ be a finite set of propositional atoms and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be a propositional language over $\\Sigma$.

In this work, we model agents by the means of logic. Deductive closed sets of formulas, which we denote from now as belief set, represent deductive capabilities; agents are assumed to be perfect reasoners. The interpretations represent worlds that the agent is capable to imagine. The following notion describes the space of epistemic possibilities of an agent's mind in a general way.\nDefinition 1 (Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez 2022; adapted). A tuple $E = (E, Bel)$ is called an epistemic space if $E$ is a non-empty set and $Bel : E \\rightarrow CBel$.\nWe call the elements of $E$ epistemic states and use $[\\Psi]$ as shorthand for $[Bel(\\Psi)]$. Definition 1 differs from the definition given by Schwind, Konieczny, and Pino P\u00e9rez (2022) insofar that we do not exclude inconsistent belief sets and forbid emptiness of $E$. Belief change operators for an epistemic space $E$ are global objects, functions on all epistemic states in the mathematical sense.\nDefinition 2. Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space. A belief change operator for $E$ is a function $* : E \\times \\mathcal{L} \\rightarrow E$.\nIn general, operators from Definition 2 could behave arbitrarily, and, of course, for considering revision and contraction, we have to add additional constraints, which we will consider in the following.\nAGM Belief Revision for Epistemic Spaces. Revision operators incorporating new beliefs into an agent's belief set, consistently, whenever this is possible. We use an adaption of the AGM postulates for revision (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985) for epistemic states (Darwiche and Pearl 1997), which is inspired by the approach of Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992).\nDefinition 3. Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space. A belief change operator $*$ for $E$ is called an (AGM) revision operator for $E$ if the following postulates are satisfied (Darwiche and Pearl 1997):\n(R1) $\\alpha \\in Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha)$\n(R2) $Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha) = Bel(\\Psi) + \\alpha$ if $Bel(\\Psi) + \\alpha$ is consistent\n(R3) If $\\alpha$ is consistent, then $Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha)$ is consistent\n(R4) If $\\alpha \\equiv \\beta$, then $Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha) = Bel(\\Psi * \\beta)$\n(R5) $Bel(\\Psi * (\\alpha \\wedge \\beta)) \\subseteq Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha) + \\beta$\n(R6) If $Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha) + \\beta$ is consistent,\nthen $Bel(\\Psi * \\alpha) + \\beta \\subseteq Bel(\\Psi * (\\alpha \\wedge \\beta))$\nAGM revision is well-known for aiming at establishing a minimal change of the prior beliefs when revising. This is carried mainly by (R2) with respect to the beliefs of an agent. Moreover, (R5) and (R6) are postulates about rational choice that ensure relational minimal change (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985; Katsuno and Mendelzon 1992; Ferm\u00e9 and Hansson 2018); an interpretation that is also"}, {"title": "Realizability of Contraction Operators", "content": "We define realizability of AGM contraction as notion that captures whether there is any contraction operator.\nDefinition 5 (Contraction Realizability).

Clearly, Theorem 6 implies that contraction operators do not exist in every epistemic space. For specific types of contraction operators, the realizability could be even more strict.

Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space. A faithful assignment for $E$ is a function $\\rightarrow <$ that maps each epistemic state $\\Psi \\in E$ to a total preorder $\\leq_{\\Psi} \\subseteq \\Omega \\times \\Omega$ over $\\Omega$ such that $[\\Psi] \\neq \\emptyset$ implies $[\\Psi] = min(\\Omega, \\leq_{\\Psi})$.\nWe link contraction operators and faithful assignments by a notion of compatibility.\nDefinition 23 (Adapted, Falakh, Rudolph, and Sauerwald, 2022). Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space and let $\\div$ be a belief change operator for $E$. A faithful assignment $\\Psi \\rightarrow <_{\\Psi}$ (for $E$) is called contraction-compatible with $\\div$ if the following holds:\n$[\\Psi \\div \\alpha] = [\\Psi] \\cup min([\\neg \\alpha], \\leq_{\\Psi})$ (contraction-compatible)\nA characterization in terms of total preorders on epistemic states is given by the following proposition.\nProposition 24 (Adapted, Konieczny and P\u00e9rez, 2017). Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space and let $\\div$ be a belief change operator for $E$. We have that $\\div$ is a contraction operator for $E$ if and only if there is a faithful assignment $\\Psi \\rightarrow <_{\\Psi}$ for $E$ which is contraction-compatible with $\\div$.\nA.2 Proofs\nIn this section, we present proofs for the novel results in our paper.\nTheorem 6. Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space. AGM contraction is realizable in $E$ if and only if $E$ satisfies:\n(ZC) For each $\\Psi \\in E$ and for each $M \\subseteq \\Omega$ with $[\\Psi] \\subseteq M$ there exists $\\Psi_M \\in E$ such that $[\\Psi_M] = M$.\nProof. We start by showing that the existence of $\\div$ implies satisfaction of (ZC). For each $w \\in \\Omega$ let $\\phi_u$ be a formula such that $[w] = \\Omega \\setminus \\{w\\}$ holds. Let $\\Psi \\in E$ be an arbitrary epistemic state and $M \\subseteq \\Omega$ be such that $[\\Psi] \\subseteq M$ holds. In the following let $M \\setminus [\\Psi] = \\{W_1,...,W_n\\}$. Using Proposition 24 we obtain that $\\Psi_M = (((((\\Psi \\div \\phi_{w_1}) \\div \\phi_{w_2})...)\\div \\phi_{w_n}$ is an epistemic state with $[\\Psi_M] = M$.\nFor the remaining direction, let $\\&_E$ be a (non-empty) set of epistemic states that satisfies (ZC). We construct a linear contraction operator for $E$. Let $\\ll$ be an arbitrary linear order on $\\Omega$, and for each $w \\in \\Omega$ let $\\Psi_{\\{w\\}}$ denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from $\\&_E$ such that $[\\Psi_{\\{w\\}}] = [\\Psi] \\cup \\{w\\}$. Let $\\div$ be the belief change operator for $\\&_E$ given as follows:\n$\\Psi \\div \\alpha = \\begin{cases}\n\\Psi & \\text{if } \\alpha \\notin Bel(\\Psi) \\\\\n\\Psi_{min([\\neg \\alpha], \\ll)} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$\nBecause $\\&_E$ satisfies (ZC), we have that for each $\\Psi \\in E$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{L}$ the epistemic state $\\Psi \\div \\alpha$ exists, i.e., $\\Psi \\div \\alpha \\in E$. Now let $\\leq_{\\Psi}$ be defined for each $\\Psi \\in E$ as follows:\n$\\leq_{\\Psi} = (\\ll \\setminus (\\Omega \\times [\\Psi])) \\cup ([\\Psi] \\times \\Omega)$.\nIndeed, $\\Psi \\rightarrow <$ is a faithful assignment. Moreover, $\\Psi \\rightarrow  <_{\\Psi}$ is contraction-compatible with $\\div$ By Proposition 24, we obtain that $\\div$ is a contraction operator for $E$.\nProposition 10. Let $E$ be an epistemic space. The following statements are equivalent:\n(I) AGM contraction is realizable in $E$.\n(II) There exists a linear contraction operator $\\div$ for $E$.\n(III)There exists a maxichoice contraction operator $\\div$ for $E$.\n(IV) There exists a full meet contraction operator $\\div$ for $E$.\nProof. Clearly, if one of the Statements (II)\u2013(IV) holds, we immediately obtain Statement (I). For Statement (I) implies Statement (II), observe that the operator $\\div$ constructed in the proof of Theorem 6 is a linear contraction operator. Moreover, because any linear contraction operator is also a maxichoice contraction, we obtain that Statement (II) implies Statement (III). We show that Statement (I) implies Statement (IV). Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space that satisfies (ZC). We construct a full meet contraction operator for $E$. For each $M \\in \\Omega$ let $\\Psi_M$ denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from $E$ such that $[\\Psi_M] = [\\Psi] \\cup M$, which exists due to the courtesy of (ZC). Let $\\div$ be the belief change operator for $\\&_E$ given as follows:\n$\\Psi \\div \\alpha = \\begin{cases}\n\\Psi & \\text{if } \\alpha \\neq Bel(\\Psi) \\\\\n\\Psi_{[\\alpha]} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$\nThe operator $\\div$ is AGM contraction operator for $E$ because when using the flat order $<_{\\Psi} = \\Omega \\times \\Omega$ for every epistemic state $\\Psi \\in E$, one obtains that $\\Psi \\rightarrow <_{\\Psi}$ is a faithful assignment contraction-compatible with $\\div$.\nGiven the above-mentioned insights on $\\div$, one can easily check that the conditions for full meet are given in Definition 7 are met by $\\div$.\nTheorem 12. Let $E = (E, Bel)$ be an epistemic space. AGM revision is realizable in $E$ if and only if $E$ satisfies:\n(ZR1) For all $w \\in \\Omega$ there is some $\\Psi_w \\in E$ with $[\\Psi_w] = \\{w\\}$.\n(ZR2) For all $\\Psi \\in E$ and for all $M \\subseteq [\\Psi]$ there exists $\\Psi_M \\in E$ with $[\\Psi_M] = M$.\nProof. We start by showing that the existence of $*$ implies satisfaction of (ZR1) and (ZR2). From satisfaction of (R1) and (R3) we obtain satisfaction of (ZR1). Therefore, pick an arbitrary epistemic state $\\Psi \\in E$ and a formula $w$ such that $[w] = \\{w\\}$. Because of (R1) and (R3) there exists some epistemic state $\\Psi \\in E$ such that $[w] = \\{w\\}$ and $\\Psi * \\phi_w = \\Psi_w$. For satisfaction of (ZR2) consider some $\\Psi \\in E$. For each $MC [\\Psi]$ let $\\Psi_M$ be such that $[\\Psi_M] = M$. Clearly, because of (R2), revision of $\\Psi$ by $M$ yields an epistemic state $\\Psi * M$ such that $[\\Psi * M] = M$ is satisfied.\nFor the remaining direction, let $\\&_E$ be a (non-empty) set of epistemic states that satisfies (ZR1) and (ZR2). Let $\\ll$ be an arbitrary linear order on $\\Omega$ and for each $M \\in \\Omega$ let $\\Psi_M$ denote a uniquely chosen epistemic state from $\\&_E$ such that"}, {"title": "Cont.", "content": "$[\\Psi_M] = M$ (as far as such an epistemic state $\\Psi_M$ exists in $\\&_E$). We construct a revision operator $*$ as follows:\n$\\Psi * \\alpha = \\begin{cases}\n\\Psi_{[\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha]} & \\text{if } [\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha] \\neq \\emptyset \\\\\n\\Psi_{min([\\alpha], \\ll)} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$\nObserve that, because of (ZR2), the epistemic state $\\Psi_{[\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha]}$ exists whenever $[\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha] \\neq \\emptyset$ holds. Moreover, because $\\ll$ is a linear order, we have, for every consistent $\\alpha$, that $min([\\alpha], \\ll)$ is a singleton set, and thus, by (ZR1) the epistemic state $\\Psi_{min([\\alpha], \\ll)}$ exists. For inconsistent $\\alpha$, the epistemic state $\\Psi_{min([\\alpha], \\ll)}$ exists by (ZR2) (and non-emptiness of $\\&_E$). In summary, for every $\\Psi \\in E$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{L}$ the epistemic state $\\Psi * \\alpha$ exists.\nWe show satisfaction of (R1)\u2013(R6) by $*$. The postulates (R1)-(R3) are immediately satisfied due to the construction of $*$. For (R4) observe that the behaviour of $*$ by input $\\alpha$ is only defined via models of $\\Psi$ and $\\alpha$. Consequently, equivalent input formulas are treated equivalently. If $[\\Psi * \\alpha] \\cap [\\beta]$ is inconsistent, then (R5) and (R6) are immediately satisfied. In the following assume that $[\\Psi * \\alpha] \\cap [\\beta]$ is consistent. For the case of $[* \\alpha] \\cap [\\Psi] \\neq \\emptyset$, we obtain (R5) and (R6) from (R2). For the case of $[* \\alpha] \\cap [\\Psi] = \\emptyset$, we have by construction that $[\\Psi * \\alpha]$ is a singleton set, i.e., $[\\Psi * \\alpha] = \\{w\\}$. Consequently, from consistence of $[\\Psi * \\alpha] \\cap [\\beta]$ we obtain $w \\in [\\beta]$. From minimality of $w$ with respect to $\\ll$, we obtain that $min([\\alpha] \\cap [\\beta], \\ll) = \\{w\\}$. We obtain satisfaction of (R5) and (R6).\nProposition 16. AGM revision is realizable in $E_{E15}$, yet there exist no full meet revision for $E_{E15}$.\nProof. AGM revision is realizable in $E_{E15}$ is witnessed by $*$ in Example 15. To show the second part of the statement, we make use of Proposition 17, and show that (Unbiased) is violated by $E_{E15}$. Clearly, this is the case, because there is no epistemic state $\\Psi$ in $E_{E15}$ such that $[\\Psi] = \\Omega$ holds, i.e., that $Bel(\\Psi) = Cn(\\{a \\lor \\neg a\\})$ holds.\nProposition 17. Let $E$ be an epistemic space. The following statements hold:\n(I) AGM revision is realizable in $E$ if and only if there exists a linear revision operator $*$ for $E$.\n(II) AGM revision is realizable in $E$ if and only if there exists a maxichoice revision operator $*$ for $E$.\n(III) There exists a full meet revision operator $*$ for $E$ if and only if the following postulate is satisfied by $E$:\n(Unbiased) For all belief sets $B \\subseteq \\mathcal{L}$ there exists an epistemic state $\\Psi_B \\in E$ with $Bel(\\Psi_B) = B$.\nProof. We consider the Statements (I)\u2013(III) independently.\n(I). We start with Statement (I). If there exists a linear revision operator $*$ for $E$, then there exists a revision operator $*$ for $E$. For the other direction, consider the proof of Theorem 12: the construction for $*$ in this proof is a linear revision operator.\n(II). For Statement (II), recall that every linear revision operator is also a maxichoice revision operator. Hence, from Statement (I), we obtain one direction of Statement (II). If there exists a maxichoice revision operator $*$ for $E$, then there exists a revision operator $*$ for $E$.\n(III). We continue with Statement (III). If there exists a full meet revision operator for $E$, then by Theorem 12, (ZR1) and (ZR2) are satisfied by $E$. Now observe that, as $*$ exists, for each $\\Psi \\in E$ and each $M$ with $M \\subseteq \\Omega \\setminus [\\Psi]$ there exists some epistemic state $\\Psi_M$ with $[\\Psi_M] = M$. This is because $*$ is a full meet revision. From (ZR2) we obtain some epistemic state with $\\Psi_\\bot \\in E$ with $[\\Psi_\\bot] = \\emptyset$. Consequently, for each $M \\subseteq \\Omega \\setminus [\\Psi_\\bot] = \\Omega$ there exists some epistemic state $\\Psi_M$ with $[\\Psi_M] = M$. Now recall that $Bel(\\cdot)$ is fully determined by $[\\Psi_M]$, i.e., $Bel(\\Psi_M) = \\{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{L} | M \\models \\alpha\\}$. We obtain that (Unbiased) is satisfied by $E$ as for $MC \\Omega$ there is one epistemic state $\\Psi_M$ such that $[\\Psi_M] = M$.\nFor the other direction, assume that (Unbiased) is satisfied by $E$. Let $\\Psi_M$ denote be a unique epistemic state from $\\&_E$ such that $[\\Psi_M] = M$ for every $M \\subseteq \\Omega$. We define the belief change operator $*$ by:\n$\\Psi * \\alpha = \\begin{cases}\n\\Psi_{[\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha]} & \\text{if } [\\Psi] \\cap [\\alpha] \\neq \\emptyset \\\\\n\\Psi_{[\\alpha]} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$\nOne can verify that $*$ is a full meet revision operator.\nProposition 19. AGM contraction is not realizable in $E_{E15}$, but AGM revision is realizable in $E_{E15}$.\nProof. Consider $E_{E15}$ from Example 15, by Theorem 12, there exists a revision operator for $E_{E15}$. By Theorem 6 there exists no contraction operator for $E_{E15}$.\nProposition 20. AGM revision is not realizable in $E_{E9}$, but AGM contraction is realizable in $E_{E9}$.\nProof. Consider $E_{E9}$ and $\\div$ from Example 9. Recall that $\\div$ is a contraction operator for $E$. By Theorem 12 there exists no revision operator for $E$."}]}

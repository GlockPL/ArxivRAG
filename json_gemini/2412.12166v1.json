Current chatbots like ChatGPT are not tailored for handling STI-related concerns out of the box. We developed Otiz, an Artificial Intelligence-based (AI-based) chatbot platform designed specifically for STI detection and counseling, and assessed its performance.\nMethods: Otiz employs a multi-agent system architecture based on GPT4-0613 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer model 4-0613), leveraging large language model (LLM) and Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) principles to provide contextually relevant, medically accurate, and empathetic responses. Its components include general STI information module, emotional recognition module, Acute Stress Disorder detection module, and psychotherapy module. Another question suggestion agent operates in parallel. Six common genital conditions- 4 STIs (anogenital warts, herpes, syphilis, urethritis/cervicitis) and 2 non-STIs (candidiasis, penile cancer) were evaluated using prompts mimicking patient language. Each prompt was independently graded by two venereologists conversing with Otiz as patient actors on six criteria: diagnostic accuracy, overall accuracy, relevance, correctness of information, comprehensibility, and empathy, using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (poor performance) to 5 (excellent performance), and qualitative feedback.\nResults: Twenty-three venereologists performed 60 evaluations of 30 prompts. Across STIs, Otiz scored highly on diagnostic accuracy (4.1-4.7), overall accuracy (4.3-4.6), correctness of information (5.0), comprehensibility (4.2-4.4), and empathy (4.5-4.8). However, relevance scores were lower (2.9-3.6), suggesting some redundancy. Diagnostic scores for non-STIs were lower (p=0.038). Inter-observer agreement was strong, with differences greater than 1 point on the NRS occurring in only 12.7% of paired evaluations (19 out of 150 pairs).\nConclusions: AI conversational agents like Otiz can provide accurate, correct, discrete, non- judgmental, readily accessible and easily understandable STI-related information in an empathetic manner. Further improvements are needed to enhance response relevance and reduce redundancy. For non-STIs, they could be useful for follow-up. With additional refinements, such chatbots can be integrated with sexual health services for a streamlined user experience, to alleviate the burden on healthcare systems.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been on the rise globally in recent years. 1,2\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are more than one million new STI cases every day worldwide.3,4 Despite this growing burden, healthcare systems often lack the infrastructure and workforce to provide adequate STI counseling and diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.5\u20137 Primary healthcare providers, already overstretched, often lack the time and specialized training needed to effectively counsel and diagnose patients with STI- related concerns.8 The growing disease burden is not matched by an increase in medical infrastructure and workforce, posing a significant challenge. Addressing these systemic issues requires long-term reforms at multiple levels, but more immediate solutions are needed to bridge the gap in access to reliable STI information and support.8\nSTIs and genital diseases carry significant social stigma, leading to hesitancy among patients in discussing these sensitive issues with healthcare providers.9 This reluctance poses a major barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment. Fear of stigma and judgment has been shown to be a significant reason for patients delaying or avoiding seeking STI-related care.10 While there is a wealth of STI-related information available online, much of it is unreliable or presented in a manner that is not easily comprehensible to the general public.11 Even reputable sources like government health websites often use medical jargon that can be difficult for patients to understand.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots present a promising solution to these challenges. AI research in STIs has mostly focused on image diagnosis through computer vision algorithms, but conversational agents also have a significant use case.12 By providing a confidential, accessible, and user-friendly platform for STI-related queries, chatbots can help patients obtain"}, {"title": "Aims and Objectives", "content": "The aims of this study were to develop an interactive, empathetic, and accurate AI-based chatbot, and to evaluate its performance in providing STI counseling and diagnosis."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "System Architecture", "content": "Otiz is based on the GPT-4 language model (version GPT4-0613). It employs a multi-agent system architecture. Four modules, comprising numerous text prompt statements, are overlaid on GPT-4.\n1. General STI information module- replicates the diagnostic process of an expert\nvenereologist through systematic analysis of primary complaints, generation of differential diagnoses, sequential formulation of follow-up questions, provision of diagnoses or differential diagnoses, and detailed information on diseases, investigations, and treatments. It employs advanced algorithms for symptom-based detection of STIs.13,16 The module also offers guidance on seeking medical attention and provides resources for further information.\n2. Emotional recognition module- activated post-diagnosis, it assesses emotional states\nthrough text analysis, identifies emotions ranging from anxiety to relief, and adapts subsequent responses for empathetic care. It utilizes sentiment analysis techniques to identify the user's mood and adapt the chatbot's responses accordingly.17\n3. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) detection module- employs a series of carefully crafted\nquestions and prompts to assess the user's psychological state and determine the likelihood of ASD. If ASD is detected, the module provides targeted support and resources to help the user cope with their diagnosis.\n4. Psychotherapy module- offers basic psychotherapeutic support, such as guided\nbreathing exercises and relaxation techniques, progressive muscle relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring strategies, to help users manage stress and anxiety related to their sexual health concerns. This module aims to bridge the gap in patient-physician communication regarding mental health and provide immediate support to users in need.\nDeterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) principle and conversational flow- DFA is a computational model that defines systems through a limited set of states with predefined transitions, allowing for precise control over user interactions and chatbot responses, ensuring that the conversation progresses logically and coherently.14 This design is critical for ensuring both the precision of medical diagnostics and empathetic patient interactions.15 It allows for precise control over user interactions and chatbot responses, and enables the implementation of context-specific prompts and questions, ensuring that the chatbot's responses are always relevant to the user's current situation. This approach helps maintain user engagement and promotes a more natural, human-like conversation. The seamless transitions between modules enable Otiz to adapt to the user's needs in real-time, mirroring the dynamic nature of human"}, {"title": "Prompt engineering", "content": "The system utilizes a sophisticated, multi-layered prompting technique that imbues the LLM with the persona of an expert venereologist while simultaneously providing a framework for medical reasoning and decision-making. The system prompt begins by defining Otiz as an 'Expert venereologist physician.' This persona establishment is crucial as it sets the tone for all subsequent interactions and decision-making processes. The prompt further refines this persona by specifying character traits such as being \"a consummate professional,\" \"witty,\" \"warm and kind,\" which guide the LLM's communication style. The system prompt incorporates metacognitive frameworks that instruct the LLM to engage in step-by-step analysis of symptoms, consideration of multiple diagnoses, and systematic questioning. The system begins by assessing the user's communication style and emotional state, leveraging the adaptive communication guidance embedded in the prompt. This initial assessment informs the tone and complexity of subsequent interactions. The system asks follow-up questions sequentially, as instructed by the prompt. This approach mimics the logical progression of a medical consultation, allowing for a thorough exploration of the user's condition while maintaining a natural conversational flow.

The 2 non-STI conditions were included to see the additional impact of STI information module, compared to other genital conditions. For each condition, five unique initiating text prompts, of one or two lines each were created, mimicking patient language, descriptions, and phrasing. The prompts were designed to represent a diverse range of manifestations and presentations and included both straightforward and more complex"}, {"title": "Data Analysis", "content": "The data collected from the venereologists' evaluations were analyzed using descriptive statistics. For each criterion, the mean and median scores were calculated across all prompts within each disease class to compare between different STI-related conditions, and with non- STI conditions. Mean NRS values between STIs and non-STIs were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired non-parametric data (p<0.05 considered significant). Inter-observer agreement between STI specialists for the same prompt was calculated by pairs with more than 1 point difference in NRS.\nThe qualitative feedback provided by the venereologists was analyzed using thematic analysis. Common themes and patterns were identified in the feedback, providing insights into the chatbot's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Quantitative analysis\nThe mean and median NRS scores for each evaluation criterion across the six disease classes are presented in Table 1. Except for relevance and diagnostic accuracy, all rest 4 parameters had mean and median scores above 4. Diagnostic scores were also above 4 for STIs but not for non-STIs. There was significant difference between diagnostic accuracy of STI vs non-STIs (p=0.038). The proportion of responses varying by more than 1 point in NRS by 2 STI specialists was low, 19/150 pairs (12.7%), max for warts (7) and discharge/proctitis (6), demonstrating good inter-observer agreement.\nQualitative Analysis\nThe qualitative feedback provided by the venereologists revealed several strengths and weaknesses of the Otiz chatbot. The most frequently mentioned strengths included:\n\u2022\tReliable medical information without any misinformation (n=13, 56.52%)\n\u2022\tEmpathetic and supportive tone (n=7, 30.43%)\n\u2022\tClear and easily understandable language (n=5, 21.74%)\n\u2022\tAbility to provide relevant resources and recommendations (n=3, 13.04%)\nThe main weaknesses identified by the venereologists were:\n\u2022\tRedundancy in some responses, with repetition of information (n=13, 56.52%)\n\u2022\tOccasional inclusion of irrelevant or unnecessary details (n=10, 43.48%)\n\u2022\tSlow response rate (n=8, 34.78%)\n\u2022\tExcessive focus on mental health, with difficulty in going back on focusing on the case (n=7, 30.43%)\n\u2022\tLimited ability to handle complex or atypical cases (n=2, 8.7%)\nThe venereologists also provided suggestions for improving the chatbot, such as:\n1. Refining the algorithms to reduce redundancy and improve the relevance of responses\n2. Expanding the knowledge base to cover a wider range of presentations and edge cases\n3. Incorporating more visuals and multimedia content to enhance user engagement and understanding\n4. Enabling easy and rapid switching to topics/areas of patients' interest, reducing the focus on mental health"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This is the first proof-of-concept of an STI conversational agent in the world, tested by a decent number of doctors performing as patient actors. People want discrete, non-judgmental, empathetic provider instantly accessible anytime of the day, who can protect them from misinformation. All of this is essentially possible by a non-human provider. The evaluation of the Otiz chatbot by venereologists demonstrated its strong performance in providing accurate, comprehensible, and empathetic responses to users seeking information and support related to STIs. The chatbot's high scores on detection accuracy, overall accuracy, and correctness of information suggest that it can serve as a reliable source of medical information for users. These findings are in line with previous studies that have highlighted the potential of AI-powered chatbots in delivering accurate and reliable health information.18,19 Similar platforms exist for mental health disorders, and are US FDA approved,20,21 Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps (ORCHA) approved, recommended and deployed by UK's National Health Service (NHS).22 They have good acceptance in the targeted users.23 STI counselling is an equally good use case for a chatbot, as it too carries stigma and requires discretion, and can be similarly integrated to other services, at least for follow-up. However, Otiz is not a replacement for doctor or medical care. It needs to be further studied in real-life/practical settings as a supplemental tool, if it is able to save providers' time in resource-limited settings by assisting in patient counseling after the initial visit, enabling them to see more patients in the same time, and improve patient satisfaction.\nThe chatbot's excellent comprehensibility and empathy scores highlight its potential to bridge the gap in access to sexual health information and support, particularly for individuals who may be hesitant to discuss these sensitive topics with healthcare providers.13 By providing"}, {"title": "Limitations and Future Work", "content": "One limitation of this study is that the evaluation was conducted by venereologists mimicking patient interactions, rather than by actual patients. While this approach allowed for a more controlled and standardized evaluation, it may not fully capture the diversity of user needs and preferences in real-world settings. Future studies should involve actual patients to assess the chatbot's performance and user experience in more ecologically valid contexts.28,31\nAnother limitation is that the study focused on a specific set of STI-related conditions and may not represent the full range of sexual health concerns that users may have. The prompt designing was done by two experts based on their experience. Using proportional thematic analysis of actual presenting complaints of the teledermatology patients, and including more experts could have made it more representative. Incorporation of more edge cases and ambiguous queries simulating more real-life challenges will be a better assessment of robustness, and should be done while assessing future versions or other such chatbots. Expanding the chatbot's knowledge base to cover a broader spectrum of sexual health topics would enhance its utility and reach.18,19\nFuture work should also focus on integrating the chatbot with other sexual health services, such as testing and treatment facilities, to provide a more comprehensive and streamlined user experience.32 Incorporating user feedback and machine learning techniques to continuously improve the chatbot's performance and adaptability to user needs is another important avenue for future development.33 Blinded trials comparing chatbot interactions with those of human counselors, and non-specific chatbots, using randomized anonymized transcripts of patients' interactions, can be reviewed by blinded assessors with validated scores to better quantify the additional impact of an STI-specific chatbot.34 Other non-STI genital diseases should also be covered by a separate module in a single chatbot, for an integrated genital disease counseling conversational agent."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Otiz serves as a reliable and accessible resource for individuals seeking STI-related information and support.

{"title": "Nudging Consent & the New Opt-Out System to the Processing of Health Data in England", "authors": ["Janos Meszaros", "Chih-hsing Ho", "Marcelo Corrales Compagnucci"], "abstract": "This chapter examines the challenges of the revised opt-out system and the secondary use of health data in England. The analysis of this data could be very valuable for science and medical treatment as well as for the discovery of new drugs. For this reason, the UK government established the \u201ccare.data program\u201d in 2013. The aim of the project was to build a central nationwide database for research and policy planning. However, the processing of personal data was planned without proper public engagement. Research has suggested that IT companies \u2013 such as in the Google DeepMind deal case had access to other kinds of sensitive data and failed to comply with data protection law. Since May 2018, the government has launched the \u201cnational data opt-out\" (ND opt-out) system with the hope of regaining public trust. Nevertheless, there are no evidence of significant changes in the ND opt-out, compared to the previous opt-out system. Neither in the use of secondary data, nor in the choices that patients can make. The only notorious difference seems to be in the way that these options are communicated and framed to the patients. Most importantly, according to the new ND opt-out, the type-1 opt-out option \u2013 which is the only choice that truly stops data from being shared outside direct care will be removed in 2020. According to the Behavioral Law and Economics literature (Nudge Theory), default rules \u2013 such as the revised opt-out system in England are very powerful, because people tend to stick to the default choices made readily available to them. The crucial question analyzed in this chapter is whether it is desirable for the UK government to stop promoting the type-1 opt-outs, and whether this could be seen as a kind of \u201chard paternalism.\u201d", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Governments are always actively seeking to enable efficient healthcare systems with the aim of improving the quality of care while reducing public spending. 1 The subject of this chapter is the secondary use of health data in England, which is one way of reaching these goals. The secondary use of health data refers to the processing of data collected during direct care for new purposes, such as research and policy planning.2 England has adopted a new opt-out system called \u201cnational data opt-out\" (ND opt-out) and it is available since May 2018.3\nDefault rules \u2013 such as the ND opt-out system in England\nare very powerful. The reason is that people tend to stick to the default option and choosing a different option requires an active decision and further deliberation costs. In other words, people tend to prefer the easiest option. In this case, the option which does not require mental effort such as in the opt-out systems. However, the further use of health data poses complex ethical,4 legal and technical challenges.5\nDefault rules can create a lot of good, but also do a lot of harm. This is one of the key conceptual arguments of the Behavioral Law and Economics literature that blend insights from cognitive psychology and economics. It takes into account the psychological traits of human behavior and a variety of other factors such as emotional, social and cognitive as the overarching framework to discuss legal issues.7 The subject of this chapter is about architectures, freedom of choice, and the legitimate ways of the UK government to nudge its citizens \u00b7 as a new form of \u201chard paternalism.\u201d\nThe chapter is divided into 7 sections. After this introduction, Sect. 2 explains the main tenets of Behavioral Law and Economics. It uses real life examples to illustrate the pervasive nature of nudges - in particular, default rules \u2013 and choice architectures which are everywhere, influencing inadvertently the decisions that people make. Section 3, discusses nudging techniques in the healthcare sector, in particular opt-out systems. Section 4, explains the National Health Service (NHS) and the opt-out system in England. This section is divided into two main parts. The first part revisits the old opt-out system and explains the new types of opt-out rules set out in the new ND-opt-out. The second part, focuses on the way this information is presented and framed to the patients. Section 5, provides some statistics on opt-outs based on recent data released by the NHS."}, {"title": "2 Behavioral Law and Economics, Choice Architectures & Default Rules as Prime Nudges", "content": "Behavioral Law and Economics became very popular and entered the mainstream of modern law and economics thanks to the works of Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. The first won the Nobel Prize in Economics with Nudge Theory in 2017. The main postulate of this theory is that improved choices and information disclosure could softly nudge (push or poke gently) individuals to improve decision-making and welfare.9\nReal-world illustrations of nudges can be found everywhere in our daily lives. Urinals at Amsterdam Schiphol airport with images of a fly just above the drain are one of such examples. According to Nudge Theory, the image of a fly would attract the attention of men and prompt them with a target at which they would aim. This experiment showed \u201cspillage\u201d on the bathroom floor was considerably reduced by 50 to 80 %.10\nAnother typical example of a nudge in our daily life is a cafeteria. Think of the manager of the cafeteria who has the freedom to arrange the food in certain places. She could place the food in a place that is more visible to people in order to affect their decisions. Putting the salad at the entrance and in a visible place, would increase the likelihood that customers would choose the salad first as a healthier option.11 To count as a nudge, \u201cthe intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid.\u201d12 Placing the salad at eye level is a nudge. Banning junk food however is a mandate.13\nEmpirical studies were carried out at two college campuses \u2013 the University of Connecticut and Alfred University in New York \u2013 by students and managers interested in seeing how re-arranging cafeteria options would influence student behavior. Their interest was not healthy eating as in the previous cafeteria example, but waste. They realized that it was very easy to load trays with food that ended up as a waste. Therefore, they ran a \u201ctrayless\u201d experiment for a couple of days and noticed that food and beverage waste dropped between 30 and 50 %. This amounts to 2 tons of food and about 424 liters of liquid waste saved on a weekly basis.14\nThese examples take us directly to the definition of a \u201cchoice architect.\u201d A choice architect, is any person who changes \u201cevery small feature in the environment that attracts our attention and influences the decision that we make.\u201d15 For Thaler and Sunstein, a nudge is \u201cany aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.\u201d16 In other words, Nudge Theory is mainly about designing choices that influence and prompt individuals to improve the decisions that they make.17\nA canonical example of a nudge is the Global Positioning System (GPS) which helps individuals find the best and shortest route. An interesting feature of the GPS is that individuals can always take another route and the GPS can easily track the location again and re-direct them with the route using signals from satellites. In this respect, the GPS system does not coerce individuals to take one particular route. It is up to the users to follow the directions of the GPS or not. This is one of the main characteristics of a nudge. A nudge never overrides individual freedom. 18\nNudging is nothing new. The private sector has been nudging consumers for decades. Marketing agencies have always used different nudging techniques to attract the attention of their customers and influence their behavior in order to sell their products. Nudges can be very helpful for individuals and society. Some of these nudges, however, may be regarded to be more controversial than others. For example, road signs are undeniably helpful for the community. They can be hardly regarded to be controversial. They give instructions to people and warn them to drive more carefully. However, if road signs are put in the wrong place, they could be dangerous and create accidents.19\nChoice architects have the responsibility of organizing the context in which people make decisions. 20 Thus, choice architectures embrace the idea of nudges. The most powerful nudges are: warning signals, information disclosures and default rules (emphasis added). In this chapter, we will focus on default rules as prime nudges. According to the Behavioral Law and Economics literature, they are inevitable and they are everywhere.21\nA classic example to illustrate a nudge as a default rule is the hardware and software of printer machines. Users can choose between single or double-sided printing. Single-side printing would obviously require more paper and ink, while double-sided printing would significantly reduce the costs expenditures of an organization. Rutgers University ran an experiment in its New Brunswick campus. They simply changed the default settings of all printers from one-sided to double-sided and saved over eighty-nine million sheets of paper during the first years of the conservation program. This amounted to a 44 % reduction which is tantamount to 4,650 trees. This zero-cost option is a good example of how changing a small feature in the design of the computer software and hardware architecture can make a big difference.22"}, {"title": "3 Nudges in the Healthcare Sector & Opt-Out Systems", "content": "A cursory look at behavioral economic insights in the healthcare sector suggests that these interventions tend to be small and often set as default rules. Subtle changes in how choices are presented, for instance, as opt-in or opt-out can make big changes in the behavior of participants. A very good example to illustrate this are default rules related to the postmortem organ donation.23 Two main default system exist at the global scale: i) opt-in system: which requires explicit consent from the deceased, and; ii) opt-out system: whereby consent is automatically assumed.24 The latter means that the deceased is a donor by default.25\nThe procedure for opt-in and opt-out differs greatly from country to country. In the United States the deceased must have previously signed up in a state registry,26 whereas in other countries such as in Japan and most European Member States, citizens have the option to check a box as an opt-in or opt-out rule when they have to renew their driving license. Opt-out default systems make the percentage of organ donation much higher than in opt-in systems.27 For example, countries such as Spain, Austria, France, Hungary, Poland and Portugal, have all implemented opt-out systems and the number of organ donation increased exponentially to 99%28 in comparison to other countries such as Denmark (4.35%) and the Netherlands (27.5%)29 which have opt-in systems.30\nDecision-making using opt-in or opt-out rules could also be attributed to the culture of a society, which may incrementally change its perception based on user experience. Empirical studies conducted in countries such as Germany, United States and Austria, revealed that signing up for an organ donation in an opt-in system was generally considered to be a virtuous act of benevolence, whereas abstaining to donate under an opt-out system was commonly viewed as egotistic and antisocial.31\nIn a recent blog by surgeon Ara Darzi \u2013 director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation of the Imperial College London \u2013 he explains the potential of behavioral economics in the field of public health and how this could be effectively applied in cancer screening. Cancer survival is lower in the UK in comparison to other countries and screening significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality. One approach to raise cancer screening is to link the screening test to other tests that people are more familiar with, such as dental check-ups or annual vehicle testing (MOT test in the UK).32 This is just another good example of how nudging and default rules can make a beneficial impact in the health care service. Below we explain the role of the National Health Service and the recent developments of the opt-out system in the England."}, {"title": "4 The National Health Service & Opt-Out System in England", "content": "The National Health Service (NHS) provides universal and free public health services in England. As a result, NHS data provide a valuable resource of routinely collected primary (e.g., visiting general practitioner (GP) practices) and secondary (e.g., hospital admissions, outpatient appointments, accident & emergency attendances) healthcare data covering almost the whole population of England.33 Three broad categories of data are collected from patients during direct care in England: i) basic personal data such as age and gender; ii) medical information such as diagnosis; and, iii) administrative information (e.g., waiting times).34\nThis information is protected by the common law duty of confidentiality (CLDC). Only in special cases can this information be processed for a new purpose, without consent. These situations might be a court order or overriding public interest (e.g., epidemics). Furthermore, Section 251 of the 2006 National Health Service Act allows the Secretary of State for Health to make regulations that bypass the CLDC for defined medical purposes. The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 play this role, as they allow the disclosure of confidential patient information without consent.35 The main reason for these disclosures is that seeking consent would require disproportionate effort or it would be impossible, and processing anonymous data might be not useful for research and planning in many cases.36\nAgainst this legal background, the care.data program was initiated in 2013, aiming at extracting patient information from direct care providers without patient consent, to build a central nationwide database for research and policy planning.37 However, the processing has been planned without proper public engagement, and the central database was aimed to be used by public and private third-party users, such as IT companies. The care.data program has raised serious public concerns38 and it has been paused several times. 39 During this period, the National Data Guardian40 (NDG) started to investigate the care.data program and developed models for consent and opt- out.41 The NDG published the \u201cCaldicott Review\u201d in 2016, a report that highlighted the issues about the secondary use of health data in the UK, and provided several recommendations for processing, consent and opt-out.42 After the publication of the report, the NHS in England canceled the care.data program.43 Despite the failure, the government remained committed to realizing the benefits of the secondary use of health data without consent; thus, the government implemented a new national data opt-out (ND opt-out) system in 2018."}, {"title": "4.1 The Opt-Out System in England", "content": "The state has the power to bypass patient consent in some circumstances, such as improving healthcare and medical research for the public interest. On the other hand, the citizens' autonomy might be maintained by giving them the choice to opt-out. Thus, the purpose of the opt-out system is to use confidential data without the burden of seeking explicit consent, while respecting peoples' autonomy. There might be cases, however, when opt-outs may seriously hinder data integrity, thus they cannot be applied.44 The number of opt-outs can be decreased with nudging techniques against this option by, for example, highlighting and framing the importance of the secondary use of health data. This is where Nudge Theory comes to the fore. The UK Government dedicated efforts to convince the patients about the value of research and policy planning. Nevertheless, the public dissatisfaction with the Google DeepMind patient data deal45 and several other studies46 indicated that the UK citizens might have concerns about whether their sensitive data is processed for a new purpose outside of direct care.\nIn the Google DeepMind patient data deal, for instance, Google's artificial intelligence firm was allowed to access health data from over 1.6 million patients to develop an app monitoring kidney disease called \u201cStreams.\u201d47 Public concerns and corroborative research studies suggested that the Google DeepMind deal had access to other kinds of sensitive data and failed to comply with data protection law.48\nThe NDG report and the failure of the care.data program lead to a change in the opt-out system in England to earn back the public trust. The \u201cold\u201d opt-out system consisted of two choices for the citizens: type-1 and type-2 opt-outs. The \u201cnew\u201d system is the ND opt-out, and it is publicly available online since May 2018. However, as we will point out in the conclusion of this chapter, there is neither a significant change in the secondary use of data, nor in the choices that patients can make. The only notorious difference is how these options are communicated to the patients."}, {"title": "4.1.1 The \"Old\u201d Opt-Out System", "content": "In England, there have been two options for citizens to prevent the secondary use of their confidential information. The type 1 opt-out prevented the information being shared outside the GPs practice for purposes other than direct care, while the type 2 opt-out prevented information being shared outside the NHS Digital49 for purposes beyond the individual's direct care. Since May 2018, the type 2 opt-out has been replaced by the ND opt-out, and the type 1 is not communicated as an option for the citizens anymore.

The previously recorded type 2 opt-outs have been automatically converted to ND opt-outs. Existing type 1 opt-outs will be respected until 2020, when the Department of Health will remove them. What is more important, the government stopped promoting type-1 opt-outs for citizens. There are leaflets, posters and an information webpage about the new ND opt-out, and neither of them conveys the fact that the patients are still able to choose the type 1 option at the GPs, which would truly stop the processing of their confidential information outside of direct care. The ND opt-out is communicated for patients in several ways such as: by healthcare staff, leaflets, posters, online, and they could also get information via telephone. The type 1 opt-out is not publicized to citizens on these publicly available materials. Furthermore, on the information website, which is on these materials, the type 1 opt-out is not even mentioned. Information about the type 1 opt-out\u00b9 can be only found on the NHS website, under the \u201cresources for health and care staff,\u201d by clicking on the \"more information for patients with a previous type 2 opt-out\u201d menu.52 This communication indicates that the government intends to slowly roll out the type 1 option, before the final removal in 2020."}, {"title": "4.2 The Presentation of the Information on the Information Materials for Patients", "content": "The new ND opt-out will only apply when identifiable data is shared for research and managing the efficient and safe operation of the healthcare system,53 thus in the case of anonymized and pseudonymized data, this choice does not apply. Another issue is that the use of the terms \"anonymized,\u201d \u201cpseudonymized\u201d and \u201cde-identified\u201d is not consistent in the UK legal terminology. These terms are used interchangeably in various codes, white papers and leaflets. Therefore, the citizens might be confused about their meaning, and they might assume that anonymization means their data is safe. However, in the UK, the term \u201canonymization\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cde-identification\u201d in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thus it can also involve \u201cpseudonymization.\u201d In other words, \u201canonymized\" data might be just \"pseudonymized\u201d data in many cases. Pseudonymization is the separation of data from the direct identifiers (e.g., name, address, NHS number), so that re-identification is not possible without additional information (the \u201ckey\u201d) which is held separately. Thus, it is still possible to re-identify the data subjects after this security measure.54\nIn this chapter, we use the terms \u201canonymization\u201d55 and \"pseudonymization\u201d56 in a manner consistent with the GDPR and the EU Data Protection Board. According to these sources, anonymized data can no longer lead to the identification of the data subject, while pseudonymization is a useful security measure which reduces the \u201clinkability\u201d of a dataset with the original data subject.57 The umbrella term for both of these measures is \u201cde-identification.\u201d Another possible ground of misunderstanding for the citizens is the notion of \u201cdirect care.\u201d They might assume this activity consists of their care by the professionals in a healthcare institution. However, direct care is a much broader concept,58 since it may also include the assurance of safe and high-quality care, which requires a background work that might not be apparent for the patients."}, {"title": "4.2.1 General Information", "content": "The UK government needs the citizens' health data for research and policy planning; thus it is crucial how the information about opt-out is presented to them. As explained above, the ND opt- out is communicated to patients in several ways: by healthcare staff, leaflets, posters, videos, online, and they may also obtain information via telephone. These materials contain mostly similar information. However, there are special versions of them for young people and minorities. In this section, we introduce how these materials communicate the secondary use of health data for citizens to help them to make their decision. Since the default setting is the sharing of health data, these materials do not have to convince citizens to give their consent, just to understand the importance of their data and accept the situation.\nOn all the information materials, the first thing which is presented to patients is the value of their health information: \u201cInformation about your health and care helps us to improve your individual care, speed up diagnosis, plan your local services and research new treatments.", "statement": "In May 2018, the strict rules about how this data can and cannot be used were strengthened.", "change": "the de-identified data can be still used for a new purpose even in the case of opt-out, and the type-1 opt-out is planned to be canceled. The NHS also promises on the leaflet that: \u201cThe NHS is committed to keeping patient information safe and always being clear about how it is used.", "direct care": "hich turned out not to be a proper legal basis60 after the investigation by the Information Commissioner.61\nThe information materials state that \"You can choose whether your confidential patient information is used for research and planning.\u201d This statement is true, however, only for the type 1 opt-out, which is about to be cancelled, and not communicated to patients. By this presentation, the patients might be biased and assume the ND opt-out can provide the full protection of their data. The leaflet explains the meaning of confidential patient information as follows: \u201cinformation identifies you and says something about your health, care or treatment. Information that only identifies you, like your name and address, is not considered confidential patient information and may still be used: for example, to contact you if your GP practice is merging with another.\u201d62 As it was highlighted in the previous section, the misunderstandings around de-identified information may lead to misinterpretation. The leaflet clearly explains how information can be confidential, and the processing of it is necessary for administrative purposes and direct care, even in the case of opt-out. In the next part, the leaflet explains who can use this confidential patient information: \u201cNHS, local authorities, universities and hospital researchers, medical colleges and pharmaceutical companies researching new treatments.\u201d63 What this part of the information leaflet does not specify, are other not medical-related companies, such as Google Deepmind and other IT corporations that might also get access to health data. As healthcare is becoming digitized, such as X-ray diagnostics using AI and machine learning, IT companies are gaining a crucial role in providing the backbone of direct care and medical research. For many years, medical doctors played the most important role in improving healthcare. However, very recently programmers and analytics have contributed significantly to improve the quality of care.64"}, {"title": "4.2.2 Information About the Exemptions", "content": "After introducing the potential users of health data, the information leaflet turns to situations, when the opt-outs might be ignored. It only introduces one situation with the highest public interest, the epidemics: \"You can choose to opt out of sharing your confidential patient information for research and planning. There may still be times when your confidential patient information is used: for example, during an epidemic where there might be a risk to you or to other people's health.\u201d However, there are many other situations when the opt-outs might be ignored, such as court orders and with regard to the use of de-identified data. The information about other exemptions can be only found on the NHS opt-out website.65\nThe information materials clarify that confidential patient information will be used for direct care regardless of the opt-outs: \u201cWill choosing this opt-out affect your care and treatment? No, your confidential patient information will still be used for your individual care. Choosing to opt- out will not affect your care and treatment. You will still be invited for screening services, such as screenings for bowel cancer.r.\u201d66 On the one hand, this information empowers citizens to opt-out if they wish, since it does not affect their individual care. On the other hand, this information may also inform patients that their information will be used regardless of their decision.\nThe following information might be the main nudging strategy against opt-out: \u201cWhat should you do next? You do not need to do anything if you are happy about how your confidential patient information is used. If you do not want your confidential patient information to be used for research and planning, you can choose to opt-out securely online or through a telephone service.\u201d67 Most citizens do not have deep knowledge on how their information is processed. The time and effort68 to read through privacy policies are burdensome69 and in many cases time wasting, since there might be no alternative choices (e.g., MS Windows, national health services). Thus, people have their subjective perception of the quality of the health service they directly receive, but less understanding concerning the information processing and administrative work behind it. It is possible that the patient is satisfied with the service, but her data is misused by private companies; and on the contrary, it is also possible that the patient had a bad experience during treatment, and chose not to share data, which would have been wisely used by private corporations to improve her future care."}, {"title": "4.2.3 Special Opt-Out Materials", "content": "The NHS is providing special information materials for minorities and young people. The information leaflets are slightly different from the general materials. The most apparent difference is the design of the information documents. While the general leaflet has a blue background with white letters, the others which target minorities and young people look more like traditional materials, with black and blue letters on white background. The materials do not have a significant difference in length: they are approximately 450-500 words, stretched across two pages. The leaflets for minorities and young people have cover pages, making the material more comfortable to hold and read.

At the time of writing this chapter, the latest publication of the opt-out statistics74 was in March 2019, and the total number of ND opt-outs was 1.6 million, which represented 2.74 % of the population of England. This number is relatively low, especially if the well-advertised ND opt-out system is compared with the previous system.\nAs explained before, the type-1 opt-out is no longer advertised to the public.

The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism, Cass Sunstein focuses on finding a justification for various nudging techniques. On the normative level, Sunstein tries to challenge John Stuart Mill's \u201charm principle, ", "epistemic argument": "nd indicates that this way of reasoning is sometimes wrong. Sunstein goes on and argues that in some cases, paternalistic interventions are desirable, specially where people are likely to make a mistake and it is necessary to provide the means for improved decision-making.79\nPaternalism comes in many forms. Sunstein explains that there are mainly four types of paternalism grouped into two main categories. One category differentiates \"hard", "soft": "aternalism. One of the criteria for distinguishing these types of paternalism relates to the imposition of material costs on individuals. \u201cHard paternalism\u201d occurs when people's free choice is coerced by the government, whereas \u201csoft paternalism\u201d is when the person is free to choose the form of action. The latter denotes very little or no intervention from the state80 such as in the GPS example explained above in Sect. 2.\nIn traditional \u201chard paternalism,\u201d the so-called \u201cnanny state\u201d uses its coercive power to nudge its citizens to do what is in their best interests.81 Nonetheless, \u201csoft paternalism\u201d holds the view that government intervention is legitimate and justified only when the person is consciously aware and acts voluntarily.82 Mill's famous example of the person who is about to cross a damaged bridge (so-called", "welfarist": "bjections for failing to take into account the fact that most public policy decisions are already made and individuals have only a limited ability to control the exercise of those underlying choices. Moreover, \u201cwelfarists\u201d fail to acknowledge the empirical findings on behavioral economics as well as the fact that choice architectures and nudges are everywhere. Sunstein advocates for a choice architecture, which he labels libertarian paternalism: individuals are encouraged to make active choices, which helps to solve the shortcomings of a much criticized, one-size-fits-all approach.85"}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "Behavioral Law and Economics has become increasingly relevant as a point of reference in policy- making and regulation over the past decade. In this regard, Nudge Theory lends itself as powerful tool that can help us to improve the normative framework. At first glance, there seems to be no major differences in the new ND-opt-out system. However, a closer look reveals some subtle, but very important changes. The bone of contention is that choices provided in the new ND-opt-out are going to be more limited in 2020, as the type-1 opt-out will disappear. Moreover, the UK's government attempt to nudge patients by framing (or even hiding) information seems to fall under the \"hard paternalism\u201d category in the Sunstein narrative, which is not the most desirable one.\nThe linchpin and value of nudges is to bring to the fore the prospect of \"choice.\u201d Therefore, the best way for the UK government to act paternalistic, but at the same time respecting citizen freedom is with a \u201csoft paternalism\u201d approach. This approach does not seem to run counter to the use of active choice mechanisms, nudges or default rules. On the contrary, the paternalist actions may lead to welfare gains that are greater than the welfare loss. Patients may feel frustrated to discover that certain decisions have already been made for them. Therefore, it is important to leave an option to revisit those decisions if people do not like them. This is the reason why we advocate to keep the type-1 opt-out system as a default rule. In this way, the opt-out choice architecture will enable patients with more options. This, in turn, will offer a stronger data protection scheme without overriding individual freedom.86"}]}

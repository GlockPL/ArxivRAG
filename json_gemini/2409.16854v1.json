In this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce a QuAM (Quantitative Argumentation Mediate) framework, which integrates the parties' knowledge and the mediator's knowledge, including facts and legal norms, when determining the acceptability of a mediation goal. Second, we develop a new formalism to model the relationship between the acceptability of a goal argument and the values assigned to a variable associated with the argument. We use a real-world legal mediation as a running example to illustrate our approach.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Dispute resolution plays an important role in modern society. Current research primarily concentrates on formal mechanisms of dispute resolution, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and litigation [1]. These mechanisms involve consensus issue of varying degrees [2]. In this work, we aim to model consensual mechanisms of dispute resolution in mediation. Unlike other mechanisms where a third party is involved, consensus in mediation takes a central role, and a mediator does not hold final decision-making power in resolving a dispute. Mediation typically falls into three categories: informal, administrative, and judicial. This work focuses on informal mediation, which deals with civil disputes. Normally, the mediation of civil disputes is conducted within the framework of civil laws, and adheres to the principle of autonomy of will. This means that, if the parties are willing, the law will not intervene proactively unless public order and good morals are violated.\nA core issue in legal mediation is combining concerns and knowledge of both parties with the facts and legal norms discovered by a mediator to effectively conduct mediation and achieve desired outcomes. The mediator has two primary functions: aiding the parties in generating options and helping to break through impasses [9]. While the former has been extensively studied [7,8], the latter is less explored. Breaking through impasses"}, {"title": "2. The QuAD framework", "content": "In this section, we introduce some existing notions of QuAD framework that will be used in the paper. For more details of QuAD framework, the readers are referred to [10].\nA QuAD framework is a 5-tuple $(A,C,P,R,BS)$, where A is a finite set of answer arguments, C is a finite set of con-arguments, P is a finite set of pro-arguments, the sets A, C, and P are pairwise disjoint; $R \\subseteq (C \\cup P) \\times (A \\cup C \\cup P)$ is an acyclic binary relation, $BS : (A \\cup C \\cup P) \\rightarrow I$ is a total function for scale $I = [0, 1]$; $BS(a)$ is the base score of argument a.\nAutomatic evaluation in a QuAD framework uses a score function SF, which assigns a final score to answer nodes. SF is defined recursively, employing a score operator that combines the base score of a node with the final scores of its attackers and supporters. In a dynamic design context, sets of attackers and supporters are actually be given in sequence, which are arbitrary permutations of the attackers and supporters.\nLet $(a_1,...,a_n)$ (resp. $(b_1,...,b_m)$) (n,m \u2265 0) be an arbitrary permutation of the attackers (resp. supporters) in $R^-(a)$ (resp. $R^+(a)$), where $R^-(a) = {b \\in C | (b,a) \\in R}$ is a set of direct attackers of a, and $R^+(a) = {b \\in P | (b,a) \\in R}$ is a set of direct supporters of a. The corresponding sequence of final scores for $R^-(a)$ and $R^+(a)$ are $SEQs_F(R^-(a)) = (SF(a_1),...,SF(a_n))$ and $SEQ_{SF}(R^+(a)) = (SF(b_1),...,SF(b_m))$. A generic score function for an argument a can be given as\n$SF(a) = g(BS(a),F_{att}(BS(a),SEQ_{SF}(R^-(a))),F_{supp}(BS(a),SEQs_F(R^+(a)))).$"}, {"title": "3. The QuAM mechanism", "content": "Based on the notion of QuAD framework, in this section, we propose an argumentation mechanism to support a mediator in assessing the extent to which the conflict between disputing parties is reduced after presenting arguments, and in discovering the acceptable values for both parties.\nIn a mediation dispute, two parties disagree on different values to be assigned to a variable, e.g., the payment of a sum from a party to another, the right to pass on a private road, the time of access to a resource, or the child custody in a divorce. The mediation goal is to identify a value acceptable to both parties. To realize this purpose, we first define the input of our mechanism, including a quantitative argumentation mediate (QuAM) framework presented by each party and a set of arguments proposed by the mediator. Next, we define an automatic evaluation method for calculating the degree of acceptability of the goal argument in a QuAM Framework. Finally, we introduce a function for mapping the acceptability degree of the goal argument to the value of a dispute variable, and propose principles for successful mediation.\nBased on the above description, our first input consists of two QuAM frameworks presented by two parties at stage 0. Note that the mediator can only add one argument each time. We denote m\u2208 N as the number of moves made by the mediator. The mediation is said to be at stage m after m moves, with the initial stage being stage 0. Each framework represents arguments (including a goal argument, attackers and supporters) and the original degrees of acceptability assigned by a party to these arguments and relations between the arguments. We assume the goal argument remains fixed throughout the mediation process. For an argument that is influenced (influence target) by a set of other arguments (influencers), we quantify the relations between the influence target and the influencers to represent their relevance. The QuAM framework is defined as follows:"}, {"title": "3.2. Automatic evaluation in a QuAM framework", "content": "The method for obtaining the final acceptability of an argument is based on the automatic evaluation in a QuAD framework [10]. The differences between the evaluation in QuAM and QuAD are additional considerations of the weight of relations and the characteristics of different types of arguments when quantifying the acceptability of an argument. We denote as $SEQ_\u03c0(R^-(a)) = (\u03c0((a_1,a)), ..., \u03c0((a_n,a)))$ and $SEQ_\u03c0(R^+(a)) = (\u03c0((b_1,a)), ..., \u03c0((b_m,a)))$ the corresponding sequence of the weight of relations. The generic score function for an argument a becomes:\n$SF(a) = g(BS(a),F_{att}(BS(a),SEQ_\u03c0(R^-(a)),SEQs_F(R^-(a))),$\n$F_{supp}(BS(a),SEQ_\u03c0(R^+(a)),SEQs_F(R^+(a))))$\n(1)\nThe degree to which a supporter (resp. attacker) increases (resp. decreases) the acceptability of an argument is proportional to the influence of the supporter (resp. attacker) and inversely proportional (resp. proportional) to the argument's previous acceptability. The influence of an influencer is proportional to its acceptability and the weight of the corresponding relation. In extreme cases, if a party does not accept an argument, even if it is 100% relevant to the influence target, the target's acceptability will remain unchanged. Conversely, if the argument is irrelevant to the target, even if the party fully accepts it, the target's acceptability will not change. To satisfy the above, we can derive the following equations to calculate the acceptability of an argument that has only one supporter or attacker, where vo is the base score of the argument, \u03c0 is the weight of the support (attack) relation, and v is the acceptability degree of the supporter (attacker):\n$f_{supp}(v_o, \u03c0, \u03bd) = v_o + (1 \u2212 v_o) \u00b7 (\u03c0\u00b7\u03bd); f_{att}(v_o, \u03c0, \u03bd) = \u03bd_o \u2212 v_o\u00b7 (\u03c0\u00b7\u03bd)$\n(2)\nIf S = (v) and \u03a0 = (\u03c0), $F_*(v_o,S) = f_*(v_o, \u03c0, \u03bd); if S = (v_1,..., v_n)$ and \u03a0 = $(\u03c0_1,..., \u03c0_n), F_*(v_o, (\u03c0_1, ..., \u03c0_n), (v_1, ..., v_{n-1})) = f_*(F_*(v_o, (\u03c0_1, ...\u03c0_n), (v_1, \u2026, v_{n\u22121})), \u03c0_n, \u03bd_n)$.\nNow we consider the characteristics of different types of arguments. As a premise, we assume that a rational person will always acknowledge the facts, and according to the core principles of civil law, informal mediation cannot violate public order and good morals. If a party is unwilling to comply with public order and good morals, they will be informed that mediation cannot resolve the dispute, and be asked to seek assistance from the court, along with being informed of the potential consequence. Therefore, in this work, the base scores of AF and ANM are always equal to 1, and they do not have attackers. Meanwhile, there is no conflict between mandatory arguments in the context of the same law or factual arguments. In the context of different laws, if conflicting norms lead to conflicting mandatory arguments, then the priority relation over the set of norms can be used to choose a set of conflict-free mandatory arguments [?]. The constraints of function g in Formula (1) are defined based on AF and ANM.\n(C1) If $b \\in R^-(a), b \\in A_F \\cup A_{NM}$ and $\u03c0((b,a)) = 1$, then $SF(a) =_{def} 0$;\n(C2) If $b \\in R^+(a), b \\in A_F \\cup A_{NM}$ and $\u03c0((b,a)) = 1$, then $SF(a) =_{def} 1$.\nProposition 3.1. Let $A_F$ and $A_{NM}$ be conflict-free sets. Given C1 and C2, if there exists $b \\in R^-(a)$, such that $b \\in A_F \\cup A_{NM}$ and $\u03c0((b,a)) = 1$, then there exists no $c \\in R^+(a)$, such that $c \\in A_F \\cup A_{NM}, \u03c0((c,a)) = 1$."}, {"title": "3.3. Transformation function", "content": "In the previous section, we have introduced a method for calculating the acceptability of a goal argument in mediation. However, this acceptability cannot be directly used to assess the specific value of the variable associated with the goal argument. For instance, while the acceptability of the goal 'full compensation' might decrease after being attacked by new arguments raised by the mediator, it doesn't reveal the exact amount the party would accept. A common approach is to propose a new argument, for instance, 'half the compensation', and redo the mediation process. This, however, can make the process cumbersome, as the mediator must rely on his subjective judgement to continually adjust goals until one is accepted. To address this, we aim to explore the relationship between a goal argument's acceptability and the variable associated with it in different mediation scenarios. The variable that two parties struggle with is called a decision variable. Each decision variable is associated with a set of possible values, and the value that a party aims to achieve is called a target value. When categorizing decision variables, we follow the civil litigation classification, which divides cases into actions for confirmation, for performance, and for modification [13]. This classification is adopted because non-litigation dispute resolution relies on legitimate civil claims, which are typically reflected in civil litigation categories. Accordingly, we classify the decision variables into binary and continuous variables, and provide transformation functions to map argument acceptability degrees to possible values, thereby simplifying the mediation process.\nBinary variables are discrete, aligning with actions for confirmation and for modification. The two subcategories of binary variables are unilateral and joint variables. Binary unilateral variables (BUV) involve decisions made by a single party, e.g., whether to remove a fence to accommodate a neighbor. Binary joint variables (BJV) involve an indivisible property or right, requiring a decision on which party will take full holdership of the property or right, e.g., who has custody of the child. The transformation functions map an acceptability degree to a possible value v \u2208 V, where V is a set of all possible values of a decision variable. For binary variables, V = {0,1}. For unilateral variables, 0 stands for 'No' and 1 stands for 'Yes'. For joint variables, 0 stands for 'the other party' and 1 stands for 'the party itself'. Since there are only two contradictory values, a decrease in the acceptability of one value will lead to an increase in the acceptability of the other, and vice versa. We use $0^1$ and $0^0$ to represent the goal arguments corresponding to values 0 and 1. For instance, concerning whether to remove a fence, for the party whose"}, {"title": "4. Properties", "content": "Since the QuAM framework is defined under the QuAD framework, all the properties proposed in [10] are satisfied.

Conclusions and future work", "content": "In this paper, we have proposed a QuAM mechanism to support a mediator in assessing the extent to which the conflict between the disputing parties is reduced after presenting arguments, and in discovering the acceptable values of the goal arguments for both parties. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we introduce a QuAM framework for determining the acceptability of a mediation goal. Second, we develop a formalism to model the relationship between the acceptability of a goal argument and the values of a decision variable.\nThere are already some works on computational mediation. Two related works are [7,8]. Sierra et al. [7] introduces a negotiation mediator that combines argumentation and case-based reasoning. The mediator integrates the argumentation systems of both parties through a merging argumentation framework, and generates and justifies solutions to help the negotiating parties, who have failed to reach an agreement, to achieve consensus. Tresca et al. [8] presents an argumentation-based mediation model that uses the mediator's knowledge and resources to facilitate the resolution of disputes between negotiating parties. These two works are extensions of negotiation, with the main goal of proposing solutions acceptable for both parties. They didn't consider the process of reaching consensus, making it difficult to assess changes in the parties' acceptance of the outcomes during mediation, and to measure the changes in the degree of conflict in dynamic process of mediation. Moreover, they did not consider the different roles that various arguments play in mediation, and the examples they used are simple cases that fall outside the scope of legal mediation, and therefore cannot be applied to legal mediation scenarios.\nAs a new methodology for dispute resolution in legal mediation based on quantitative argumentation, there are some promising research topics worth to be further studied. First, we have not yet explored how mediators should present arguments to resolve disputes most efficiently. So, it is interesting to develop strategies for the mediation process to better assist a mediator in the process of mediation, based on the theory of strategic argumentation [14]. Second, specific functions of transformation and the thresholds have not been specified and instantiated yet. Possible future work may include the specification of detailed transformation functions, and effective machine learning methods for learning thresholds. Third, it can be challenging to find suitable datasets. A possible way is to generate synthetic datasets."}]}

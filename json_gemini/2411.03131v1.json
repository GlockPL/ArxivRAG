Originating as a technique to revive individuals from drowning incidents, it has evolved into a universally recognized procedure for cardiac arrest victims, regardless of the cause (Cooper et al., 2006). At its core, CPR serves as an interim measure to simulate the heart's function of pumping blood, ensuring that oxygenated blood continues to circulate to vital organs, especially the brain (Raza et al., 2021). This is crucial because brain cells begin to die within minutes without oxygen, leading to irreversible brain damage or death (Lee et al., 2022). With more than 400,000 cases each year in North America and an average survival rate of 10%, the impact of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) on public health is substantial (Meier et al., 2010). Despite recent technological advancements, the survival rate has been stagnating over the past few years. Management of cardiac arrest is defined by international recommendations, defined by National Resuscitation Council (Herlitz et al., 1997). It is optimized by multiple interconnected links that form the Chain of Survival. One of the most important link of this chain is CPR (Chamberlain et al., 2008). The American Heart Association and other global health organizations have emphasized the significance of CPR, not just among healthcare professionals but also among the general public (Hinkelbein et al., 2020). This is because the majority of cardiac arrests occur outside of hospital settings, where immediate medical intervention is not readily available. In such scenarios, bystander CPR can be the difference between life and death (Pellegrino et al., 2021). Despite its proven efficacy, several challenges persist in the realm of CPR. These include disparities in public awareness, variations in training methodologies, and evolving guidelines based on new research findings (Raza et al., 2021). While traditional CPR techniques undoubtedly save countless lives and play a crucial role in the field of medical emergencies, several challenges persist. Specifically, the effectiveness of traditional CPR is hindered by the variability in human performance. Due to the dynamic nature of CPR in medical emergencies, it is very difficult for humans to consistently provide optimal pressure at the appropriate time intervals over an extended period (Ewy and Kern, 2009). The recent advancements in technology and the emergence of Machine Learning (ML) offer new possibilities. To address these challenges, ML presents a potential solution to assist medical practitioners and enhance resuscitation techniques. ML algorithms can process vast amounts of data and make real-time decisions, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of CPR interventions. Integrating ML into CPR procedures could revolutionize the way we respond to cardiac arrests and significantly improve patient outcomes (Dahal and Ali, 2022; Harford et al., 2019a). The paper methodically reviews and analyzes existing ML applications in CPR, identifies research gaps, and uncovers unexplored potential, setting a new direction"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "2.1 Historical Background\nThe history of CPR has evolved dramatically from early airway management techniques in the 16th century to systematic approaches developed in the 18th century. Key advancements include the refinement of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in the late 1950s and the progression of cardiac massage from open chest methods in 1874 to closed chest techniques by 1960. Significant improvements in electrical defibrillation also occurred, starting with internal use in 1947 and moving to external applications by 1956 (Cooper et al., 2006; DeBard, 1980). These modern CPR methods were standardized in the past few decades, leading to the development of automatic and semi-automatic defibrillators, which have enhanced prehospital and home resuscitation efforts. The integration of these techniques has significantly improved survival rates from cardiac arrest, illustrating the critical importance of ongoing research and innovation in CPR (Cummins et al., 1986). Today, CPR has become a globally recognized emergency procedure, continuously refined through research and technological advancements. Recent innovations in ML and AI analyze real-time data to enhance the precision of CPR, improving outcomes. These advancements promise to further increase CPR's effectiveness and save more lives. \n2.2 Historical Techniques\nOver time, CPR has evolved alongside advancements in medicine. By the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the role of oxygenation and circulation became increasingly important to the success of resuscitation efforts. However, the most significant evolution in CPR occurred with the introduction of closed-chest cardiac massage combined with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\u2022 Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation: Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, widely recognized as a lifesaving technique in the 20th century, actually has roots that trace back to ancient practices. Studies, such as the one conducted by Poulsen et al. (1959), have demonstrated that this method can provide adequate alveolar ventilation. However, it also carries risks, including the possibility of hypoventilation. This highlights the importance of proper training in different resuscitation techniques to ensure effective emergency responses.\n\u2022 Closed-Chest Cardiac Massage: In the mid-20th century, Kouwenhoven et al. (1960) demonstrated that rhythmic chest compression could generate external blood"}, {"title": "2.3 Modern Advancements", "content": "The landscape of CPR has witnessed profound transformations in recent decades, with the advancements in medical science leading to improved techniques and tools for first responders and medical professionals, expanding life-saving possibilities.\n\u2022 Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs): All studied AEDs meet diagnostic rhythm performance standards in real OHCA scenarios, with errors typically due to operator issues rather than device faults (Zijlstra et al., 2017). Fully automatic AEDs enhance correct shock delivery, and improving emergency cardiac care outcomes.\n\u2022 Compression-Only CPR: Compression-only CPR maintains organ blood flow during cardiac arrest and simplifies the process by eliminating mouth-to-mouth ventilation. Studies show compressions are crucial in early cardiac arrest for sufficient blood oxygen (Sayre et al., 2008).\n\u2022 Mechanical CPR Devices: Mechanical CPR devices, which deliver consistent and optimal compressions, reduce the physical exertion required from rescuers. They are especially beneficial during patient transport or challenging manual compression situations (Rubertsson et al., 2014).\n\u2022 Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS): POCUS has transformed cardiac arrest management by enabling real-time heart visualization, allowing clinicians to quickly identify and treat reversible causes. It also guides interventions like fluid administration and medication adjustments based on real-time cardiac responses (Gaspari et al., 2016).\n\u2022 Feedback Devices in CPR: Skorning et al. (2010) describe a visual feedback device that improves chest compression performance in CPR simulations, enhancing rate, depth, and sufficiency. Its simplicity makes it suitable for trained responders, reinforcing the chain of survival and potentially improving cardiac arrest outcomes.\n\u2022 Telemedicine and Remote Guidance: Telemedicine integrates into CPR by providing real-time guidance via video calls, notably improving chest compression rate and accuracy over audio-only instructions. However, it may slightly delay bystander CPR initiation in simulated settings (Lin et al., 2018).\n\u2022 Integration of AR-VR Technology: AR and VR technologies expand CPR training by enabling practice in realistic scenarios, yet wider adoption is needed in this promising research area (Semsarian et al., 2015)."}, {"title": "3 CPR Methodologies and AI-Driven Approaches", "content": "3.1 Methodologies\nThe evolving field of CPR is marked by numerous impactful studies across different years, employing varied methodologies and focusing on diverse applications. A comparative analysis is necessary to explore the insights into CPR technique evolution and current practices, highlighting the ongoing importance of research to enhance and optimize CPR procedures."}, {"title": "3.2 AI-Driven Approaches", "content": "The application of ML has become increasingly prominent in medicine, as it supports healthcare professionals in analyzing and diagnosing various health conditions, with a particular focus on cardiovascular diseases (Bhushan et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2022). In particular, CPR is one area where ML is beginning to play a prominent role, especially with advancements in devices and technology. These developments are aiding in the refinement and automation of CPR techniques, leading to improvements in resuscitation practices.\n4 Classification of ML Approaches for CPR Tasks\n4.1 Taxonomy\nThe integration of ML and AI in CPR has led to various innovations. These advancements range from early detection of cardiac arrest during emergency calls to the optimization of chest compressions and ventilation. The upcoming part of this paper provides a comparative overview of several studies that have contributed to these"}, {"title": "4.2 Rhythm Analysis", "content": "Accurate rhythm analysis during CPR is crucial for determining the appropriate interventions. In fact, survival during OHCA relies on accurate shock decisions from AEDs.\nHowever, chest compressions corrupt electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, complicating shock timing. Thus, ML methods are introduced to ensure the balance between continuous compressions and timely shock delivery."}, {"title": "4.3 Outcome Prediction", "content": "Outcome prediction in CPR involves analyzing the ECG signal characteristics, particularly before and after delivering CPR, to estimate the probability of successful defibrillation, survival, and neurological outcomes. Measures like the cardioversion outcome prediction (COP) quantify the likelihood of successful defibrillation by assessing ECG signal changes induced by CPR. Clinical prediction models using factors like initial presentation, interventions, and time intervals can also reliably estimate survival probabilities in OHCA patients (Box et al., 2008). Accurate outcome prediction can guide appropriate interventions and management decisions during resuscitation efforts."}, {"title": "4.4 Non-Invasive Blood Pressure and Chest Compression", "content": "Non-Invasive blood pressure is a method to measure blood pressure without needing to insert anything into the body. It uses external devices like an inflatable cuff around the arm. During CPR, monitoring non-invasive blood pressure helps track the patient's blood pressure to make sure chest compressions and other treatments are working (Hansen and B\u00fclow, 2014). Chest compressions are a key part of CPR. They involve pressing down on the patient's chest to manually pump blood through the heart and circulate it around the body. Proper chest compressions are crucial to keep blood flowing to vital organs until the heart can start beating effectively on its own again (Nishiyama et al., 2010). So, The non-invasive blood pressure and chest compression are co-related and crucial tasks of CPR.\n4.5 Pulse and Return Of Spontaneous Circulation Detection (ROSC)\nIn CPR, pulse detection is an important aspect that assists in deciding whether to continue chest compressions or to pursue alternative interventions. In the context of CPR, pulse detection and ROSC detection are closely related as they both involve assessing the presence or absence of a pulse or heartbeat to guide resuscitation efforts (Wei et al., 2017). Once chest compressions are initiated, the healthcare team continues to monitor the patient for signs of ROSC. ROSC occurs when a patient who previously had no pulse or heartbeat regains a spontaneous, organized cardiac rhythm. Detecting ROSC during CPR is a critical milestone as it indicates that circulation has been restored and that the heart is functioning on its own (Sell et al., 2010).\nIn the context of CPR, ROSC detection is closely related as they both involve assessing the presence or absence of a pulse or heartbeat to guide resuscitation efforts."}, {"title": "5 Future Prospects, Challenges and Discussion", "content": "After thoroughly exploring current ML methods for improving CPR, we have looked into the prospects of how these approaches can naturally make CPR more effective. We examined various existing ML strategies and identified those paying close attention to supervised learning. However, the availability of labeled data is very difficult considering real-life CPR scenarios. In contrast, there is limited experimentation with unsupervised and self-supervised learning approaches. In addition, only one paper has been identified concerning the application of the RL approach for CPR optimization. In fact, the potential for the utilization of RL in automating and optimizing CPR procedures is still not explored significantly. Moreover, current CPR research employs traditional ML methods like Random Forest, KNN, SVM, LSTM, and CNN, but lacks exploration of Transformer-based architectures, which might offer superior capabilities in handling sequential and contextual data, potentially revolutionizing resuscitation research. Furthermore, Human-aware AI and explainability are important concerns in the future, especially in considering critical decision-making tasks in medical applications in general (Zaki et al., 2023) and the CPR context using ML in particular. In this section, we will investigate all of these possibilities that RL could offer for CPR, as well as explore other AI techniques such as transformers and Explainable AI (XAI), highlighting their significance in the context of CPR.\n5.1 Potentiality of Reinforcement Learning\nRL algorithms can be effective in learning optimal chest compression techniques by interacting with simulated or real-world CPR scenarios. The RL agent, representing the model, can receive feedback on compression depth, rate, and the patient's other status, dynamically adapting its actions to maximize the likelihood of successful resuscitation and provide the optimal amount of pressure on the chest and abdomen to increase the blood pressure on the heart, where the time interval is also very crucial and RL model identify the optimal pressure and time step. Human feedback reinforcement learning (HFRL) can be effective in CPR by incorporating real-time guidance from human practitioners. In CPR scenarios, HFRL can adaptively learn and refine CPR techniques based on direct feedback from healthcare providers, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of CPR administration over time. This approach leverages medical expertise to enhance the learning process of RL algorithms, ensuring that CPR techniques are continually optimized and tailored to individual patient needs and response patterns (Griffith et al., 2013; Bai et al., 2022). Moreover, RL is instrumental in the development of adaptive CPR protocols that adjust dynamically based on patient responses and evolving clinical conditions. By recognizing patterns in physiological data, the RL agent can adjust compression parameters and recommend interventions accordingly. Analyzing large datasets with RL algorithms can help to identify patterns that link to successful outcomes, which aids in continuously improving quality, refining protocols, and updating guidelines based on real-world results (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Wiering and Van Otterlo, 2012). Furthermore, RL algorithms have the capability to analyze patient-specific data and develop personalized resuscitation plans, leading to CPR strategies customized to individual patient characteristics. Multiple RL methods can effectively accomplish these tasks (Li, 2017; Arulkumaran et al., 2017).\nPolicy Gradient Methods: Policy Gradient Methods play a crucial role in training adaptive policies that guide healthcare providers during resuscitation efforts. These methods learn from observed states, such as patient vital signs, to directly map to optimal actions, like adjusting chest compression depth and rate. They are well-suited for continuous and dynamic action spaces, making them effective for improving the quality of chest compressions (Sutton et al., 1999). By shaping reward functions to encourage desirable actions, addressing uncertainty, and accommodating patient-specific conditions, these methods contribute to personalized and effective CPR strategies. Their adaptability, online learning capabilities, and potential for transfer learning across scenarios make Policy Gradient Methods valuable tools for enhancing decision-making in dynamic and critical CPR environments (Peters and Schaal, 2006), (Gu et al., 2017). Moreover, Actor-critic methods combine aspects of both value-based (Q-learning) and policy-based methods. The actor (policy) learns the optimal actions, and the critic evaluates the chosen actions. This can be useful for learning adaptive resuscitation protocols (Grondman et al., 2012), (Kumar et al., 2020).\nPolicy Optimization Algorithms and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG): In the field of CPR optimization, Policy Optimization Algorithms and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are particularly effective algorithms for learning directly the best actions to take during resuscitation based on the observed states, which can be useful for dealing with the continuous and dynamic nature of CPR\n5.2 Transformers and Explainable AI\nOn the other hand, our investigation of ML approaches for future applications identified a significant gap. Although methods like Random Forest, KNN, SVM, LSTM, and CNN have been used in CPR research, experiments with Transformer-based architectures are notably absent. Transformers have shown promise in capturing and understanding sequential and contextual information in the long range, which can be effective in CPR scenarios. Their strong ability to analyze temporal and dynamic data suggests that incorporating Transformer-based architectures could greatly enhance the range of ML methods used in resuscitation research.\nPotentiality of Transformers: Transformers, designed for the efficient processing of sequential data, hold significant promise in capturing long-range dependencies and temporal patterns crucial for decision-making, which can be vital in CPR signal processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2022). The attention mechanism might be useful to focus on specific parts of input CPR sequences, prioritizing relevant information in response to variations in patient responses during CPR interventions. Transformers are particularly skilled at capturing contextual information, which can be invaluable in comprehending physiological changes and the effectiveness of interventions in CPR scenarios. Moreover, with the ability to process data in parallel, Transformer models could provide quick and accurate real-time decision support, crucial in dynamic CPR situations (Islam et al., 2023). In addition, pre-training on large datasets enables transfer learning for CPR-specific tasks, leveraging knowledge from diverse healthcare contexts (Han et al., 2021; Ruan and Jin, 2022). The interpretability provided by attention weights promotes transparency, helping healthcare professionals comprehend the model's decision-making process. Additionally, Transformers can be useful to support continuous learning and adaptation to evolving patient conditions, updating their understanding during resuscitation efforts for ongoing decision support. They also exhibit flexibility in handling multi-modal inputs, integrating diverse data sources like ECG, blood pressure, and respiratory rate for comprehensive decision-making. Further exploration of Transformer model applications can potentially lead to groundbreaking improvements in CPR processing (Che et al., 2021; Vrba and Robinson, 2001).\nRelevance of Explainable AI: Looking forward into the future, at least two central themes for research linking ML to CPR seem to be of interest to make progress. We have seen how ML algorithms may yield important guidance for administering CPR. But it will be practitioners who actually take actions and make decisions based on what the ML systems indicate. This means that providing effective interfaces for the human users to view what the ML systems propose will be quite important (Nuutinen and Leskel\u00e4, 2023; Bienefeld et al., 2023). And as practitioners are increasingly asked to adjust their decisions according to the advice of AI systems, a really essential goal will be to support providing explanations of the reasoning of those AI systems (known as XAI or explainable AI) in a way that the human users can comprehend. The more that our AI systems migrate to embracing deep learning, the more challenging it will be to actually explain the inner workings of those systems (Contreras et al., 2023). If solutions based on Large Language Models (LLMs) really do become more commonplace for any healthcare applications of ML, there are at least some ideas currently for how to generate those explanations (Huang et al., 2023) as a promising starting point. The introduction of attention-based transformer models can highlight the relevance of particular contexts in use but here too some XAI research has explored how to work with these approaches (Chefer et al., 2021; Alammar, 2021) so that \u03a7\u0391\u0399 within CPR should be effective as well. The fact that other researchers have begun to tackle human-AI partnerships in the setting of emergency medicine is also very encouraging (Okada et al., 2023; M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4 et al., 2023). The study of human-aware AI may pose challenges to resolve in full and systems in use that yield more straightforward output are certainly important as our first steps, but the path ahead with more forward-looking AI models is one that we can seek to explore, in order to secure important acceptance of these systems in all their forms, into the future.\n5.3 Discussion and Conclusion\nIn future CPR research, a major obstacle is the difficulty of obtaining real-life CPR data. Accessing high-quality, labeled data for CPR scenarios is challenging due to privacy regulations and ethical considerations surrounding medical data. In addition, it is difficult to get large amounts of data classifying CPR procedures into successful and unsuccessful administrations. This scarcity of large and diverse datasets that accurately represent various CPR situations makes it hard to train robust ML models. To overcome these challenges, generative models such as variational autoencoders can help create large amounts of data points resembling the existing small amount of real-life data. Moreover, synthetic data generation techniques can be delicate along with real-life data, whereas more mathematical models such as Babbs provide representations of CPR scenarios, allowing the generation of realistic synthetic data (Babbs et al., 1984; Fitzgerald et al., 1981). Additionally, data augmentation techniques offer a promising strategy to enhance datasets, enabling extensive research in CPR. The scarcity of data is not the only challenge; selecting the right data is also complicated. The use of Self-Directed Machine Learning (SDML) is one of the ML solutions that may be adopted in the future in CPR applications, as it supports medical staff in selecting proper data and making the right decisions in a secure and robust manner (Zhu et al., 2022).\nTo conclude, this paper highlights the potential of integrating ML with life-saving CPR techniques during cardiac arrest. By thoroughly reviewing and analyzing existing ML applications in CPR, we have identified key research gaps and unexplored opportunities that could pave the way for significant advancements in the biomedical field. Our comprehensive synthesis underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and medical research and sets a strategic framework for future studies. We believe that the continued exploration and implementation of ML in CPR will improve resuscitation outcomes, enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency medical interventions, and ultimately save more lives."}]}

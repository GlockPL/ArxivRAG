I heard a lot about this book but have never read it. What did he mean by thinking fast and thinking slow?\n\nA: Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered that human thinking is driven by two distinct systems, System 1 and System 2.\n\nSystem 1 supports fast thinking. It \u201coperates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control The capabilities of System 1 include innate skills that we share with other animals\" [7, pp. 41-43]. System 1 is good at detecting patterns and reading situations on the fly. It allows us to make snap judgments and decisions without deliberation, but it is prone to biases and errors.\n\nSystem 2 supports slow thinking which is deliberate, analytical, and conscious. \"System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration\" [7, p 41]. System 2 can override the impulses and biases generated by System 1.\n\nQ: I probably rely on System 1 more than I should.\n\nA: System 2 is much slower than System 1 and requires more effort. \u201cWhile walking comfortably with a friend, ask him to compute 23 \u00d7 78 in his head, and to do so immediately. He will almost certainly stop in his tracks \" [7, p 74]. It is"}, {"title": "Is generative AI intelligent?", "content": "Q: Generative AI is getting a lot of press recently. Is it intelligent?\n\nA: The AI revolution is impressive. Generative AI is used in many domains. In particular, it is used to improve existing logic tools. Generative AI is changing our lives. But is it already intelligent? The issue is controversial and super interesting; it richly deserves a separate conversation.\n\nQ: May we address it anyway, at least briefly?\n\nA: Sure. So the thesis under discussion is that the current generative AI is intelligent. Let's first hear skeptics.\n\nEdward Gibson is a psycholinguistics professor at MIT and the head of the MIT Language Lab. In his recent interview with Lex Fridman, Gibson argues that the current LLMs are all about the form, not meaning.\n\n\"I would argue they're doing the form. They're doing the form, they're doing it really, really well. And are they doing the meaning? No, probably not. There's lots of these examples from various groups showing that they can be tricked in all kinds of ways. They really don't understand the meaning of what's going on. And so there's a lot of examples which show they don't really understand what's going on\" [4, 01:34:33].\n\nQ: Presumably, GPT-4 knows all grammatical rules of English in all existing grammar books."}, {"title": "Reasoning and logic in AI", "content": "Q: Concerning LeCun's item 3, what kind of reasoning is AI incapable of?\n\nA: System 2 reasoning. An LLM is basically just two files. One is a huge data file that reflects the information the model was trained on. The other is an algorithm, typically succinct, which usually embodies the model architecture as well as a probabilistic inference mechanism. That mechanism works with a sequence of words. It starts with a given query, and runs in rounds. During one round, it infers another word and appends it to the current sequence. (More exactly, it works with subword tokens which are not necessarily full words.)\n\nSometimes the next word is obvious, but sometimes it is very hard to figure out an appropriate next word. But the LLM cannot stop and think. In the AI parlance, \"it is allocating approximately the same amount of compute for each token it generates\" [1, 00:59:51]. In that sense it uses only fast thinking (System 1). As far as we know, it is an open problem how to improve the process by incorporating slow, deliberate thinking (System 2).\n\nQ: Understanding of the real world seems to involve reasoning as well, both System 1 reasoning and System 2 reasoning, from evading predators (fast thinking) to quantum physics (slow thinking). Thus reasoning is ubiquitous in AI, and AI needs many different kinds of reasoning. It would be natural if the role of logic in AI would grow and grow. And yet, Yuri wrote that \u201cthe golden age of logic in artificial intelligence is behind us\" [5, \u00a74]. How come?\n\nA: At the early stage of AI, the logic approach was dominating. A lot of good work was done; see the article \u201cLogic-based artificial intelligence\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [15]. But then an important competitor arose. Let us quote LeCun on the issue2."}, {"title": "Real-world understanding", "content": "Q: Coming back to real-world understanding, robots need to navigate around obstacles and handle objects without causing damage to those objects, to themselves, and of course to people. This requires understanding of the physical world. But, unlike robots, LLMs don't walk around and they have read much of what there is to read. Shouldn't all that knowledge give them a near perfect understanding of the physical world?\n\nA: Not really.\n\nQ: Can you illustrate that?\n\nA: Sure. Henri Lebesgue had an idea that we can build upon: there are cases where arithmetic does not apply. \"Suppose I put two animals in a cage and then two more. How many animals will the cage then contain? [8, p. 14]\" Let's present a version of this scenario to Google's Gemini.\n\nSuppose that I put 2 animals of one kind and 3 animals of another kind into a closed space. How many animals will be there altogether?\n\nAdding the number of animals of each kind together, you will have 2+3=5 animals altogether.\n\nQ: This is ridiculous. Gemini doesn't realize that the result depends on the kinds of animals. For example, the two animals of the first kind may consume some or all of the three animals of the other kind. Maybe, Gemini takes into account only the moment that the you close the door of the closed space.\n\nA: OK, let's check your hypothesis.\n\nWhat if I check the total number of animals not immediately but in one hour, one day, or one month?"}, {"title": "Moravec's paradox", "content": "Q: It is ironic that Gemini can do impressive intellectual work but misses obvious things about the physical world.\n\nA: You rediscovered Moravec's paradox from the 1980s. Here's an instructive quote from Hans Moravec's 1988 book [11, pp. 15-16]:\n\n\"It seemed to me that, in the early 1970s, some of the creators of successful reasoning programs suspected that the poor performance in the robotics work somehow reflected the intellectual abilities of those attracted to that side of the research. Such intellectual snobbery is not unheard of, for instance between theorists and experimentalists in physics. But as the number of demonstrations has mounted, it has become clear that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult-level performance in"}, {"title": "Thinking fast", "content": "Q: All this makes the fast-thinking grasp of the real world even more interesting and relevant. Clearly, LLMs would need such a grasp.\n\nA: They need it already. Have you recently spoken to an LLM-powered chatbot?\n\nQ: I try to avoid them and talk to humans.\n\nA: This will be harder and harder to do.\n\nQ: It is already plenty hard and sometimes virtually impossible; try to talk to OpenAI support.\n\nBut, OK, let's suppose that I am chatting with a bot representative of some company.\n\nA: Imagine that they sent you something, say a laptop, and it arrived damaged, that you waited for that laptop longer than promised, and that you need one right now. A human would quickly realize that you are upset and would try to be extra empathetic. So should the bot.\n\nQ: Yes, and this requires reading the situation on the fly, fast thinking.\n\nNow that I have some idea about fast thinking, I understand Yuri's question what the logic of fast thinking is in the February 2021 column. But is there is a logic of fast thinking?\n\nA: Much depends on what we mean by logic. George Boole discovered an algebra of universal \"laws of thought\" [3], that is, universal laws of slow thinking. Is there a useful algebra of universal laws of fast thinking? We doubt it. Fast thinking is rather far from exact reasoning.\n\nQ: Are there any meaningful rules of fast thinking?\n\nA: Oh, yes. For example, we intuitively judge the frequency of an event by how easily examples come to mind, which can be influenced by recent exposure and emotions [7, p. 244]. Such rules of thumb help us, given inconclusive perceptions, to produce quickly an action that is often beneficial but may be detrimental.\n\nArguably logic should study the laws of thinking, including fast thinking, whatever they are. The intention, in the question about the logic of fast"}, {"title": "The dawn and heyday of logic", "content": "Q: Studying fast thinking may expand logic tremendously. Do you know historical examples where logic expanded so greatly?\n\nA: One example is related to the emergence of logic as a separate discipline in the classical Greek period.\n\nQ: Was there any logic before that?\n\nA: Various forms of structured argumentation were used before the classical Greek period, certainly in China and India. But it was in Greece that logic became a separate discipline.\n\nQ: Does this have something to do with Athenian democracy?\n\nA: The practice of Greek democracy wasn't limited to Athens, though Athens is the best-documented case. The Athenian democracy was characterized by the participation of its (free male) citizens in the Assembly and courts. There were many occasions where one had to convince numerous citizens rather than talking to gods or to a few aristocrats. The necessity of convincing argumentation drove the development of logic as well as of rhetoric and demagoguery. The contributions of Aristotle and his school were particularly significant in the birth of logic as a discipline. Aristotle's system of logic was virtually unchallenged until the 19th century.\n\nQ: Mathematics greatly advanced in the period from Aristotle to the 19th century. Mathematical arguments went beyond Aristotelian syllogisms. They must have used much more sophisticated logic, and logic seems to precede mathematics, logically speaking\n\nA: Yes, already in the time of Aristotle mathematics involved logic beyond Aristotelian syllogisms. But for a long time mathematicians used deduction principles implicitly. After all, those principles are essentially trivialities. One learned them in the course of learning mathematics.\n\nQ: Still, there were many developments in mathematics, between Euclid's time and 19th century."}, {"title": "", "content": "A: The most dramatic development was the invention of calculus. Its use of infinitesimals and related notions, like infinite sums, certainly raised new logical issues. Reasonable looking computations could contradict each other.\n\nQ: Give me an example.\n\nA: Consider the infinite series $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 \u2212 1 + ...$ One way to sum it is\n$(1-1) 1 \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 1) + . . . = 0$. Another way is\n$1 + (\u22121 + 1) + (\u22121 + 1) + ... = 1$. Which way, if any, is the correct one? The foundations of mathematics became problematic.\n\nQ: Today we know that the series does not converge.\n\nA: It took a while for mathematicians to work out notions like convergence. The problem was actual infinity. Mathematicians used to work with finite objects and potential infinity, never actual infinity. E.g., for Euclid, the only lines were finite line segments.\n\nQ: In my experience, people mention infinitesimals but don't use them.\n\nA: Eventually, the language of infinitesimals was replaced by the precise language of epsilon and delta, and thus the foundations of analysis got rid of the fuzziness induced by infinitesimals.\n\nThe introduction of set theory by Georg Cantor improved the situation further. Cantor bravely dealt with actual infinity and made great progress.\nMathematicians quickly grew comfortable with set theory. In particular, it was observed that ordered pairs can be coded as sets, which allowed modern set-theoretic definitions of notions like function and relation purely in terms of set membership.\n\nBut at the same time paradoxes of set theory were discovered, and a real crisis arose in the foundations of mathematics. It wasn't clear anymore which convincing reasoning is valid and which is not.\n\nQ: And, I guess, all this provoked the birth of mathematical logic.\n\nA: Even before the discovery of paradoxes, important foundational work was done, notably by George Boole, Giuseppe Peano, and Gottlob Frege. But the foundational crisis put mathematical logic in the center of attention. The crisis was resolved, for all practical purposes, by the development of axiomatic set theory.\n\nQ: Did this make logic popular?"}, {"title": "Logic in the age of AI", "content": "Q: In both cases, the birth of logic and the resolution of the foundational crisis in mathematics, there was a need, and logic rose to the occasion. Demand preceded supply, so to speak. Do you think that, this time around, generative AI provides sufficient demand?\n\nA: It does. The demand is ubiquitous.\n\nQ: Give me an example.\n\nA: A quick glance at a person gives you a surprising amount of information. We may learn the gender, estimate the age, etc. Such rapid assessment was instrumental to our survival as a species.\n\nQ: It seems that, as in object-oriented programming, a person P is viewed as an object with various attributes.\n\nA: But the set of attributes may depend on the assessor; for example, a runner may see whether P is a runner. Also, the set of values that an attribute takes may be dynamic; for example, a child may learn only whether P is a child or an adult in contrast to an adult's more precise estimate of P's age.\n\nQ: Surely, psychologists and neuroscientists are already studying rapid assessment. What can logic add?\n\nA: Rapid assessment is a case of fast thinking. In [5], Yuri asked what the logic of fast thinking is. If and when laws of fast thinking are understood, at least to some extent, they may help us to analyze rapid assessment.\n\nQ: Do you think that logic will rise to meet the AI challenge?\n\nA: This is an interesting question. To us, logic is the study of reasoning, any kind of reasoning [5]. There is no doubt that the kinds of reasoning which are relevant to AI will be studied.\n\nQ: But will those studies be called logic? Maybe, AI logic?\n\nA: At the moment this does not look probable. It is not predetermined what is or is not logic. Conflicting social processes are in play. Much depends on how and whether the logic community will address the challenge.\n\nThe story of infinitesimal calculus may be instructive. See a sketch of that story in [5, \u00a72]. After the invention of infinitesimal calculus, a question arose how to reason with infinitesimals? For a couple of centuries, mathematicians struggled with the problem and eventually largely solved it using the epsilon-delta approach that essentially eliminated infinitesimals. In a sense, the mathematical heroes of that story worked as logicians but this wasn't recognized. This particular story has a happy, albeit somewhat bitter, end of sorts as far as logicians are concerned. Abraham Robinson came up with a proper logic of infinitesimals, which he called nonstandard analysis and which allows you to handle infinitesimals consistently [12]. But, in the meantime, mathematicians got accustomed to the epsilon-delta approach and weren't too much interested in nonstandard analysis which is arguably more elegant and efficient.\n\nQ: You wish of course that logic will be more successful in AI.\n\nA: True."}]}

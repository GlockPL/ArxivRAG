Semi-rigid connections provide a compromise between the stiffness of fully rigid connections and the flexibility of fully pinned connections. However, designing such structures is challenging due to the non-linear behavior of semi-rigid connections. The BFGA is a robust optimization method that combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm to handle the complexity and uncertainties of structural design problems. The BFGA, compared to standard GA, demonstrated to generate high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. The application of the BFGA is demonstrated through the optimization of steel structures with semi-rigid connections, considering the weight, and performance criteria. The results show that the proposed BFGA is capable of finding optimal designs that satisfy all the design requirements and constraints.

Introduction", "content": "Semi-rigid connections are defined as connections that exhibit partial moment-resisting behavior, meaning that they allow some degree of rotation between the two connected members, but also provide some resistance to lateral movement. These connections typically include elements such as bolts, welding, or other fasteners that provide a certain level of stiffness while allowing some rotational flexibility. Semi-rigid connections are commonly used in building frames, bridges, and industrial structures where rotational flexibility is required but excessive movement must be avoided. For example, in building frames, semi-rigid connections are used to connect beams to columns, allowing the structure to resist lateral loads while also providing some flexibility to accommodate movement due to wind or seismic activity.\nSemi-rigid connections offer several advantages over fully rigid or fully flexible connections. One major advantage is that they can provide a higher level of ductility in the structure, which is the ability of the structure to deform without breaking during extreme events such as earthquakes. This is because semi-rigid connections can accommodate some level of movement without compromising the overall structural integrity. Another advantage of semi-rigid connections is that they can be more cost-effective than fully rigid connections. This is because they require less material and can be easier to fabricate and install than fully rigid connections. Additionally, semi-rigid connections can provide some level of energy dissipation, which can help to reduce the overall dynamic response of the structure to external loads. However, they can be more complex to design and analyze than fully rigid or fully flexible connections because the behavior of semi-rigid connections can be more difficult to predict, and the design must take into account the interaction between the connected members, the connection details, and the loading conditions.\nStructural optimization is a crucial area of research in engineering, as it allows for the design of structures that are both efficient and cost-effective [1]. The use of semi-rigid connections in structures is an important consideration in this process, as these connections provide some degree of rotational flexibility while also maintaining a level of stiffness. Despite significant progress in understanding the behavior and design of semi-rigid connections, there remains a gap in the literature when it comes to optimizing structures with these connections.\nIn particular, previous studies have mostly focused on the behavior and design of either fully rigid or fully flexible connections. Several methods have been proposed for the optimization of structures with semi-rigid connections, ranging from simplified analytical approaches to more complex numerical simulations. These methods typically take into account the behavior of the connections and their interaction with other structural elements, as well as the overall stiffness and load-bearing capacity of the structure.\nStructural elements such as castellated beams with semi-rigid connection were considered as optimization problems [2, 3].

Bilinear Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm", "content": "Numerous optimization applications have made extensive use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and its fuzzy variant (Fuzzy-GA) [36-39]. The performance of the fuzzy GA can be influenced by the membership function used through the fuzzification process. Here, the bi-linear membership function is utilized in Fuzzy-GA for both constraints and objective function to accelerate its performance.\nAccording to crisp logic, a phenomenon can either be true or false. The application of crisp logic will complicate the circumstances for structural optimal design since the problem is affected by a significant level of ambiguity and imprecision. Fuzzy logic takes into account the transition between exclusion and inclusion using a membership function, \u03bcy, which converts each member of set X into a fuzzy set Y by doing the following:\n$\\begin{cases}\\mu_{\\gamma}(x) \\in [0,1]\\\\x\\in X\\end{cases}$ (1)\nThe value of membership in crisp logic for structural element i is equal to 1 if \u03c3\u2081 < \u03c3\u00b2 and equal to zero if the constraint is not fulfilled. However, the membership value (a) is altered from 0 to 1 for fuzzy logic, where a = 1 denotes that the constraint is fulfilled and a = 0 denotes that the constraint has been violated relative to the specified tolerance. Consequently, 0 < a < 1 denotes that the constraint has been met to the specified amount. When using fuzzy optimization with the membership function, both inequality constraints and the objective function are fuzzified.\n$\\mu_{P}(x) = \\mu_{F}(x) \\cap \\{\\bigcap\\limits_{i=1}^{m} \\mu_{g_i}(x)\\}$ (2)\nwhere, \u00b5g\u1d62(x) and \u00b5F(x) denote the membership functions for the ith inequality constraint and the objective function, respectively. The Xopt is achieved from the region as:\n$\\zeta(X_{opt}) = max\\{\\mu_{P}(x)\\}, \\zeta(x) = min\\{\\mu_{F}(x), min\\limits_{i=1,...,m} \\mu_{g_i}(x)\\}$ (3)\nThe membership functions related to the objective function and constraints (Fig. 1) are intersected to provide a fuzzy domain. The optimization problem can be expressed using a general satisfaction parameter (\u03bb) as follows:\nmaximize \u03bb subject to"}, {"title": "3. Computational modeling of semi-rigid connections", "content": "An applied moment M causes a connection to rotate through an angle \u03b8, which is the angle between the original positions of the beam and column. One approach taken by researchers to model semi-rigid connections in steel frames is to use moment-rotation relationships achieved from experimental investigations. Fig. 3 illustrates various types of moment-rotation curves for these connections that have been derived by researchers. Semi-rigid beam connections can be modeled using rotational springs, as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, where dra and Orb represent the relative spring rotations of both ends, and Ka and KB are the corresponding spring stiffness.\n$K_A = \\frac{K_A}{\\Theta_A} , K_B = \\frac{K_B}{\\Theta_B}$ (9)\nThe stiffness matrix in global coordinates for beam member (i) with semi-rigid end connections can be expressed as:\n(10)\nwhere,\n$b_1 = \\frac{EA}{L}cos^2\\alpha + \\frac{12EI}{KL^2}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin^2\\alpha$\n$b_2 = \\frac{EA}{L}sin^2\\alpha + \\frac{12EI}{KL^2}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})cos^2\\alpha$\n$b_3 = \\frac{EA}{L}sin\\alpha cos\\alpha - \\frac{12EI}{KL^2}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin \\alpha cos \\theta$\n$b_4 = \\frac{12EI}{KL^3}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin\\alpha$\n$b_5 = \\frac{12EI}{KL^3}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin \\alpha cos \\alpha$\n$b_6 = \\frac{12EI}{KL^3}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin \\alpha$\n$b_7 = \\frac{12EI}{KL^3}(\\frac{1}{K_A} + \\frac{1}{K_B} - \\frac{1}{K_A K_B})sin \\alpha$\n$K = (1 + \\frac{L}{LKA})(1 + \\frac{L}{LKB}) - (\\frac{4EI}{KL^2})(\\frac{4}{KL^2})$"}, {"title": "4.

Conclusions", "content": "This chapter utilized a hybrid approach of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm to optimize the structural weight of rigid and semi-rigid steel frames, while satisfying the displacement and stress constraints. To improve convergence speed, the genetic algorithm employs a bilinear membership function. Predefined scale factors are proposed to be used in the objective function to balance two terms of the equation and improve convergence.\nThe displacement constraints have a greater effect on taller frames compared to other parameters, and the difference in weight between the optimized frames with semi-rigid and rigid connections is small for taller frames. Conclusions drawn from the design examples include:\nThe use of semi-rigid connections instead of rigid ones may cause the roof to displace laterally by a higher percentage, ranging from 4.2% to 22.4%. When using genetic algorithms to optimize steel frame design, incorporating fuzzy logic can lead to a reduction in the total weight of the structure by 1% to 6% compared to using simple genetic algorithms. Furthermore, the convergence rate can improve, and better solutions can be obtained with the use of fuzzy logic. The stiffness of the connections plays a key role in determining the lateral displacement and the overall structural weight. Increasing the stiffness of the connections can lead to a decrease in lateral displacement and an increase in the total weight. Conversely, using semi-rigid connections can reduce the weight of the frame by 0.8% to 11.7%. Parameters of the genetic algorithm, such as the possibility of mutation and crossover probability, affect convergence velocity; and the Population size affects the optimum weight, with larger population size resulting in a small decrease in weight but a large increase in computing time."}]}

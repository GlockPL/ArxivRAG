However, methodological inconsistencies, particularly in author name disambiguation and gender identification, limit the reliability and comparability of these studies, potentially perpetuating misperceptions and hindering effective interventions. A review of 70 relevant publications over the past 12 years reveals a wide range of approaches, from name-based and manual searches to more algorithmic and gold-standard methods, with no clear consensus on best practices. This variability, compounded by challenges such as accurately disambiguating Asian names and managing unassigned gender labels, underscores the urgent need for standardized and robust methodologies. To address this critical gap, we propose the development and implementation of \"Scholarly Data Analysis (SODA) Cards.\" These cards will provide a structured framework for documenting and reporting key methodological choices in scholarly data analysis, including author name disambiguation and gender identification procedures. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, SODA Cards will facilitate more accurate comparisons and aggregations of research findings, ultimately supporting evidence-informed policymaking and enabling the longitudinal tracking of analytical approaches in the study of gender and other social biases in academia.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Gender inequality and bias in academia persist through systemic discrimination, implicit prejudices, and structural barriers, continuing to disadvantage women across various stages of their careers, hindering both their development and productivity [5; 13]. These inequities and biases manifest in multiple forms, such as biased hiring evaluations and unequal access to funding [10; 79]. Such challenges create a compounded disadvantage, adversely affecting female researchers' recruitment, retention, promotion, and overall career progression [33; 80; 97]. Over time, these cumulative effects lead to the persistent underrepresentation of women at various stages in academic roles.\nFor instance, according to the 2023 CRA Taulbee Survey [17], women represented approximately"}, {"title": "2 A landscape of scholarly data analysis research", "content": "Scholarly data analysis is a broad research topic that focuses on the analysis of scholarly research publications. This ranges from analysis of citation networks of research papers and authors, to text analysis of research papers. Our work focuses on the practice of working with scholarly data with a focus on identifying author demographic-based patterns in scholarly metrics like citations, publication count, research careers, etc. To conduct such analysis, authors often utilize a few common methods like author name disambiguation and author demographic assignment, e.g., identification of gender, age, ethnicity, and race. Furthermore, scholarly data analysis often focuses on causal relationships between author demographics and scholarly metrics. We describe these methods and analysis in the following sections and highlight how the common methods in existing scholarly work motivated us to analyze the distribution of these methods in popular research and propose the construction of the SoDA Cards to standardize the practice of reporting scholarly data analysis practices in future works."}, {"title": "2.1 Author name disambiguation", "content": "Research papers list individuals involved with the research work in the paper byline. These individuals are often identified via their name, institution, and other identifiers. For the purpose of analysis, these listed identifiers on a research paper are called authorships, while the individuals associated with these identifiers are considered authors. This difference is illustrated in figure 2.\nWu [98] also provides a good overview of gender bias in citation research based on authorships and authors. The process of going from a list of authorships to authors is commonly referred to as author name disambiguation or AND.\nAuthor name disambiguation is an essential task in bibliometric research. It involves accurately identifying and distinguishing unique authors, accounting for variations in names that may be identical or similar, and finding and indexing variations of unique authors, which is a frequent challenge in large bibliometric databases [39]. Typically, author names are disambiguated using similarity measures to assign authorship of bibliographic records to individual authors based on data"}, {"title": "2.2 Gender identification", "content": "Once an author has been correctly identified, associating them with further demographic information often uses only the author's name. The task of identifying the gender of authors in bibliometric studies is another critical aspect in the investigation of gender bias. This data can then be used to assess patterns of gender bias within a research field. Traditional gender identification methods have relied on gender-name dictionaries or lists, which associate first names with a specific gender based on societal norms or legal documents [46]. These databases are often built from census data or similar large-scale demographic datasets. While effective for many Western names, these methods can struggle with unisex or non-Western names, leading to inaccuracies in gender assignment [102].\nRecently, more sophisticated methods of gender identification have been developed to address these limitations. Some studies utilize machine learning algorithms trained on large datasets to predict the gender of an author based on their first name. These models can incorporate additional features, such as a name's cultural, institutional, or linguistic context, improving their accuracy, especially for non-Western names. Despite these advancements, gender identification in bibliometric studies still faces numerous challenges. For instance, handling unknown or ambiguous gender remains a significant issue. Many studies default to a binary gender model, which can inadvertently exclude or misclassify authors who do not identify as male or female. Furthermore, cultural and regional differences in names can complicate gender identification. Names from many Asian cultures, for instance, may not follow Western naming conventions, and it can be difficult to determine gender based solely on these names [90; 88]."}, {"title": "2.3 Demographic bias investigation research", "content": "Investigating gender bias in scholarly research has far-reaching implications, as the outcomes of such studies can inform academic practices and guide the development or adjustment of policies aimed at promoting equality [5; 30]. The reliability of these studies fundamentally depends on the accuracy of the author name disambiguation and gender prediction methods or algorithms on which they are based. Various approaches to author name disambiguation and gender identification exist, including algorithmic solutions, name-based inference, manual verification, and the use of authors' self-reported data.\nAlgorithmic solutions for gender identification, such as Genderize.io, Gender API, the gender package in R, SexMachine in Python, and Namsor, rely on large datasets of name-to-gender associations. Tools like Genderize.io and Gender API predict gender by analyzing the frequency of names in databases and utilizing machine learning techniques. We refer the reader to the survey of these techniques by [77] for details.\nName-based inference methods use predefined name lists or databases to infer gender, but their reliability can be limited due to cultural variability in naming conventions.

To thoroughly examine gender disparities, it is critical to incorporate causal factors into the analysis to assess whether these factors account for or mitigate observed gender gaps. For example, factors such as career length (e.g., seniority), institutional rank, publication venue, and journal impact factor have been used to explore how structural or individual variables contribute to disparities [48; 35]. By including these variables, researchers can determine whether the disparities are reduced or explained away when considering specific contributing factors, providing a more nuanced understanding of gender bias. We observed that while studies we reviewed tended not to include potential causal factors in their analysis, recent papers increasingly incorporate these variables to add rigor to their conclusions.\nSome causal factors frequently included are authors' career lengths (i.e., seniority), year of publication, and number of authors. Furthermore, the papers studying causal factors tend to consider numerous variables, such as country, affiliation rank (e.g., whether the author is associated with a high-ranking or lower-ranking institution based on metrics such as global university rankings), venue of publication, institutional affiliation, academic roles (e.g., full, associate, or assistant professors), journal impact factors, and area of research. For instance, Caplar et al. [8] included seniority of the first author, number of references, total number of authors, year of publication, journal of publication, field of study, and geographical region of the first author's institution as causal factors into their analysis to observe the effect size of the gender bias after controlling the aforementioned causal factors. They found gender bias in their analysis, and controlling for causal factors makes their result claims more credible. Similarly, Dworkin et al. [21] and Wang et al. [95] incorporated the year of publication, the number of authors, whether the paper was a review article, and the seniority of the paper's first and last authors into their analysis.\nPapers that included causal factors show mixed results on the effect size, some discovering a decreased gender gap and some reporting no change in gender gap after controlling for causal factors. For instance, Huang et al. [35] reported that after controlling for career length as a causal factor, the gender gap in total productivity reduced from 31.0% to 7.8%, while including the country and affiliation rank did not further significantly affect the gender bias result, and considering total productivity as a causal factor eliminated the gender gap. Dion et al. [19] discovered that more gender-diverse subfields and disciplines produce smaller gender citation gaps. However, Odic and Wojcik [65] observed that male first authors achieve higher publication counts and citation counts even when affiliations are controlled for. Furthermore, they found no evidence for the assumption that the publication rate in individual subfields can account for the observed publication gender gap. This decrease in the gender gap after controlling for some causal factors implies that it is crucial to include causal factors in the analysis to add more rigor to the results."}, {"title": "2.5 Motivation for our work", "content": "The choice and application of author name disambiguation and gender identification methods can significantly influence the results and their interpretation [38]. For instance, [38] showed how the academic community's reliance on the seemingly benign practice of using initials for author name disambiguation leads to significant distortions in the statistical properties of coauthorship networks, including underestimating the number of unique authors and network components and overestimating average productivity, number of co-authors per author, areas of expertise per author, and network density. Such errors caused by methodological flaws in author name disambiguation and gender identification underscore a) the profound influence that these inaccuracies can have on results and subsequent analyses, and b) the need for an in-depth assessment of methodological approaches and their implications on downstream research tasks. To address these needs, our study provides a comprehensive literature review that examines the range of techniques used for author name disambiguation and gender identification. This review spans a variety of disciplines, time periods, and locations, aiming to ensure robust, consistent, and objective findings.\nBy rigorously investigating these methodologies, our paper seeks to achieve three primary objectives:\n\u2022 A comprehensive analysis of the methods used for author name disambiguation and gender identification in 70 papers.\n\u2022 The identification of common challenges and patterns in implementing author name disambiguation and gender identification methods.\n\u2022 A standardization of the scholarly data analysis process through SoDA Cards as a solution to the outlined issues with variation and transparency in methods."}, {"title": "2.6 Scholarly Data Analysis (SoDA) Cards", "content": "Standardized methods for benchmarking and documenting data provenance and measurement choices are integral to many fields [28]. As a prime example, the machine learning community employs practices such as providing Model Cards [59] and Datasheets [28]. Model Cards provide detailed performance reports for trained machine learning models across various conditions, ensuring clear and human-readable communication about a model's capabilities, intent of use, and limitations. Similarly, Datasheets serve as a standardized means of conveying important characteristics of datasets used in machine learning. Although the machine learning community widely embraces transparent reporting practices, these methods can be overlooked in bibliometrics.\nBuilding upon the conventions of standardized practices in machine learning like Model Cards and Datasheets, this study proposes SODA Cards, tailored for bibliometric research to foster transparency in reporting practices. While such reporting practices might appear to be predominantly suited for machine learning applications, they are equally relevant for bibliometric and scientometric studies because these fields heavily depend on author name disambiguation and gender identification methods and algorithms. The inherent complexity and variety of these methods accentuate the need for transparent and standardized reporting, which would foster greater reproducibility and comparability across studies. More importantly, it would pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and progress in the ongoing quest to understand and address gender and other demographic biases in the measurement and practices of the evolution of science and the scientific workforce.\nFrom our literature review, we learned that there are inconsistencies within and across methodological pipelines.

We first discuss how we annotated for AND, followed by gender identification. We identified five commonly used approaches for AND: no disambiguation, algorithmic methods, name-based approaches, manual searches, and self-reported data (gold standards). Each paper was categorized into one of these approaches, with detailed descriptions provided in a codebook (Table 1).\nTo annotate gender identification methods, we developed a detailed codebook (see Table 1) to account for the diverse approaches used across various studies. Unlike author name disambiguation, which typically relies on a single method, gender identification often involves multiple strategies tailored to effectively identify names from different countries or cultural backgrounds. Consequently, our annotation process for gender identification differs from that of AND. Specifically, we evaluated each paper based on two distinct facets: the number of gender identification methods employed and the types of methods used. Initially, we identified the number of gender identification methods utilized in each paper, categorizing them as either \"Single\" or \"Multiple.\" This classification allowed us to capture whether a study relied on one method or incorporated several techniques for gender identification. Subsequently, we categorized each gender identification method into one of four types: algorithmic, self-reported, manual search, and name-based/heuristics. For example, if a paper exclusively employed algorithmic methods for gender identification, we annotated it as using a \"Single\" method and classified the method as \"Algorithmic.\" If a paper utilized multiple gender identification methods, we labeled it with each applicable method type, such as both \"Algorithmic\" and \"Manual Search.\"\nThis annotation approach allows us to comprehensively understand the methodological landscape of gender identification in scholarly literature. By distinguishing between the number and types of gender identification methods, we can better analyze trends and preferences in research approaches, highlighting whether studies employ single-method approaches or integrate multiple techniques, e.g., to enhance accuracy and reliability. Detailed descriptions of each gender identification approach and the criteria for categorization are provided in Table 1. During the gender identification process, gender can be classified as a binary value or more than two categories. Some studies also incorporate \"unknown\" gender in the analysis."}, {"title": "3.3 Evaluation of annotations using kappa scores", "content": "We calculate Cohen's kappa (\u03ba) to measure the interrater reliability of annotating author name disambiguation and gender identification methods [16].

If Pr(a) gives the proportion of times two raters agree, and Pr(e) gives the proportion of expected agreement, then \u043a can be represented by:\nCohen's kappa(\u03ba) = (Pr(a) \u2013 Pr(e))/(1 \u2013 Pr(e)) (1)\nThis study employed three doctoral researchers as annotators in a collaborative data coding process.

This level of detail is crucial for understanding the geographic and cultural scope of their analyses, especially when dealing with the diversity and complexity of naming conventions. Names can vary significantly across regions in terms of structure, order of family and given names, and the frequency of certain surnames [54]. Such differences require researchers to adopt culturally sensitive methodologies to ensure accurate identification and categorization.

However, the reliance on binary labels for gender categorization presents a significant limitation as it restricts the acknowledgment of diverse gender identities, including non-binary, by forcing them into one of two predefined categories [102]. Further, this binary constraint hinders a more comprehensive understanding of gender bias at a fine-grained level. The complexity of this issue is compounded by the fact that gender identification algorithms predominantly use binary labels, thus perpetuating this narrow classification framework. Nevertheless, some studies have attempted to move beyond binary labels to provide a more comprehensive view of gender inequalities in academia. For instance, Larivi\u00e8re et al. [46] used binary categories and unisex labels for the names appearing in both lists as unisex.\nAdditionally, we noticed that some studies introduced a separate \u2018Unknown' category for authors whose gender identities could not be determined [69; 58; 60; 82; 94]. This approach, particularly the effort to acknowledge rather than disregard authors with unassigned gender by including a specific label for gender-unidentified authors, represents a step towards inclusivity and a more nuanced understanding of gender dynamics in academia. We also noted a methodological concern: numerous studies tend to exclude authors with indeterminate gender identities when analyzing gender disparities. This approach may have drawbacks, particularly in the context of Asian names, such"}, {"title": "4.2.3 Considerations of Asian names", "content": "Our literature review highlighted challenges in handling Asian-origin names, particularly in the context of gender identification. The prevalence of unisex names for scholars from these regions makes it difficult to accurately determine the gender of authors with Asian names. We observed that some studies opted to exclude authors with Asian names from their analyses. This exclusion, which impacts authors from certain ethnic groups, is sometimes explicitly mentioned in the papers and introduces biases in the analysis. For instance, overlooking influential scholars with high citation counts from specific fields can distort the representation of academic impact and productivity. In studies focusing on citation counts or publication volumes, such exclusions may lead to incomplete or misleading conclusions about disparities in academic contributions across genders and ethnic groups.\nMoreover, we noticed that most papers lacked detailed information about how names from different regions, particularly Asian countries, were handled. Specifically, there's often little to no information on the proportion of names from Asian countries or the differential treatment of authors with Asian origins. However, some studies have addressed this issue directly. For instance, Huang et al. [35] provided a comprehensive explanation for their decision to exclude certain ethnic groups from their analysis: they acknowledged that while many name disambiguation algorithms effectively help to reconstruct the careers of authors with European names, they struggle with those of Asian origin. This, combined with the difficulty in inferring gender from Asian names, led them to exclude researchers from China (including mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), Japan, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and Singapore [35].

Improving these processes is essential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of studies investigating gender biases. To conduct reliable investigations of gender biases at the authors' career level, it is vital to adhere to key methodological steps. These include rigorous author identification and disambiguation and the accurate attribution of demographic details such as gender, race, and nationality. Moreover, it's crucial to control for causal factors that might impact the variables under study. These essential steps are illustrated in Figure 1. Inaccuracies in author identification not only compromise the integrity of data but also lead to skewed analyses, which can yield biased interpretations of gender disparities in academia. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving these disparities and might adversely impact policymaking.\nGiven these observations, our findings have significant implications for future research in this domain. Emphasizing precise author attribution and acknowledging individual contributions becomes pivotal in studies exploring gender bias. As the field progresses, developing more sophisticated and reliable methods for author name disambiguation is essential to validate findings in gender bias research. To move forward, we propose the introduction of a model card system for bibliometric studies. These SODA Cards serve as a standardized tool for researchers to document and share their methodologies and results.

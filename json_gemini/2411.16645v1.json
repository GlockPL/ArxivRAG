{"title": "Recommender Systems for Good (RS4Good): Survey of Use Cases and a Call to Action for Research that Matters", "authors": ["DIETMAR JANNACH", "ALAN SAID", "MARKO TKAL\u010cI\u010c", "MARKUS ZANKER"], "abstract": "In the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of research efforts is spent on developing increasingly sophisticated recommendation models, also using increasingly more computational resources. Unfortunately, most of these research efforts target a very small set of application domains, mostly e-commerce and media recommendation. Furthermore, many of these models are never evaluated with users, let alone put into practice. The scientific, economic and societal value of much of these efforts by scholars therefore remains largely unclear. To achieve a stronger positive impact resulting from these efforts, we posit that we as a research community should more often address use cases where recommender systems contribute to societal good (RS4Good). In this opinion piece, we first discuss a number of examples where the use of recommender systems for problems of societal concern has been successfully explored in the literature. We then proceed by outlining a paradigmatic shift that is needed to conduct successful RS4Good research, where the key ingredients are interdisciplinary collaborations and longitudinal evaluation approaches with humans in the loop.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Whenever you read a paper on recommender systems published in the past twenty-five years,\nchances are good that it has several or all of the following characteristics: (i) the paper proposes\na new recommendation algorithm, (ii) the algorithm is evaluated in the movie or e-commerce\ndomain, and (iii), the evaluation is focusing on prediction accuracy and it is based on an offline\nexperiment without involving humans in the loop [49]. As a result, we nowadays have hundreds\u2014if\nnot thousands-of algorithmic proposals and machine learning (ML) models at our hands that were\ndesigned for, or at least evaluated, on some movie or e-commerce dataset. Yet these achievements\nare seemingly not enough. Despite or due to all this progress, research addressing similar problems\nflourishes and, nowadays, involves increasingly complex deep learning architectures and, most\nrecently, large language models with an immense carbon footprint [86, 98].\nIn terms of application domain, there is of course no doubt that recommendations can create\nsubstantial business value in e-commerce environments, see [45]. There are also various papers from\nlarge players in the media streaming market reporting on the benefits of providing personalized\nmovie or video recommendations, including Netflix and YouTube [14, 36, 89]. However, due to the\nstrong focus on offline experimentation in scholarly research, we unfortunately do not possess\na lot of evidence on the practical effectiveness of the countless algorithmic proposals mentioned\nabove. Will all these algorithmic contributions with their mostly small increases in offline prediction\naccuracy lead to more user engagement, higher retention rates, higher sales and more satisfied users?\nFor many algorithmic proposals, the answer is probably 'no'. Netflix actually never implemented\nthe winning solution of the million-dollar Netflix Prize competition in production\u00b9, and in a later\npaper [36] made a rather disappointed statement about the often limited correlation between\noutcomes of offline experiments and the success of a deployed model.\nAll that puts us as researchers in a situation where we have developed countless recommendation\nalgorithms over the years, of which however only a very tiny fraction has been tested \u2018in the wild'.\nEven worse, there is both evidence from the academic literature and from industry reports that gains\nin offline accuracy do not reliably translate to increased consumer or business value in practice.\nNonetheless, despite all these known limitations we observe a constant and maybe even increasing\ninflow of new algorithmic papers that are evaluated in offline experiments on datasets from a\nlimited set of domains.\nThe question arises why we as a recommender systems research community continue to put so\nmuch effort into such a small set of application domains and delimit ourselves to only a few research\nmethodologies. Actually, the literature contains a multitude of examples where recommender\nsystems are applied to a variety of application domains beyond movies and e-commerce. Moreover,\nthe value that is created in several of these settings goes beyond the creation of economic value\nfor the platform provider as well as beyond individual hedonic or utilitarian needs of consumers.\nWe may, for instance, think of recommender systems that guide users to a healthier life style,\nrecommender systems that stimulate energy-saving behavior, or systems that help users achieve\nself-actualization goals.\nGiven that these application areas are largely underexplored in the literature, we call the research\ncommunity to re-focus our combined efforts to areas where recommender systems can contribute to\nthe achievement of societal goals. Following ideas of recent initiatives like \u2018AI4Good\u2019\u00b2 or 'IR4Good'\u00b3,\nwe envision the development of an \u2018RS4Good' movement in the recommender systems community.\nAs a result, we hope that the future research efforts in our community will be better aligned with\nthe pressing challenges that we face as a society. However, as we will lay out in more depth in\nthe following sections, to achieve these goals it will not be sufficient to only use different datasets,\nbut a paradigmatic shift is required, instead. It involves the following components: (i) a focus on\nproblems of societal relevance, (ii) a multi-disciplinary research approach involving humans in the\nloop, and, (iii) the consideration of the longitudinal effects of recommender systems.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Next, in Section 2, we will explain why RS4Good\nambitions must go beyond recent initiatives to only avoiding harm, and we will outline a number\nof RS4Good application areas. Section 3 then describes the implications of a shift to RS4Good use\ncases in terms of the applied research methodology."}, {"title": "2 RS4GOOD: TOPIC AREAS", "content": "In this section, we position the RS4Good initiative with respect to recent developments in the area\nof 'responsible recommendation' and then review a number of potential application areas for future\nRS4Good developments."}, {"title": "2.1 Defining RS4Good: From Avoiding Harm to Doing Good", "content": "Recommender systems are commonly designed to create positive effects and different types of\nvalue for the involved stakeholders. Typical examples of such values include the avoidance of\ninformation overload for end users or increased sales for businesses. During the past few years,\nit however became more and more evident that recommender systems may also lead to harm"}, {"title": "2.2 Selected Use Cases of RS4Good Research", "content": "In their recent work, Felfernig et al. [29] discussed the potential role of recommender systems to\nsupport the United Nation's 17 Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). These SDGs comprise\nboth areas that are well aligned with typical goals of recommender systems (e.g., \u2018economic growth')\nas well as areas which, as of today, are barely related to existing recommender systems research\n(e.g., 'life below water'). In our following discussion of the RS4Good research landscape, we will\ntherefore not follow the UN's SDG organization, but rather structure our work along application\ndomains where the use of recommendation systems has been already explored at least to a certain\nextent. We emphasize that our discussion and categorization is not meant to be exhaustive. Instead,\nit shall serve as an illustration and motivation for the many possible directions that our community\nshould explore in more depth in the future.\nWe note that our discussion of existing works is mainly organized in terms of application domains.\nWe however recall that whether a recommender systems is considered to be \u2018for good' does not\ndepend on the application domain. A recommendation system in the e-commerce domain, for\nexample, can be guided purely by economic objectives. It may however also have elements of\nan RS4Good system, e.g., when the recommender is designed to prioritize sustainable product\nalternatives. As mentioned in the previous section, it depends on the underlying goals that are\nimplemented in the recommender system. In the following, we review a number of RS4Good\nsystems in different application contexts."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Health", "content": "The health domain is a prime example where recommender systems can be applied\nfor societal good in various ways. A survey of recommender systems in healthcare can be found\nin [95]. In this survey, the authors identify the following main application areas.\n\u2022 Food recommendation: Use cases involve the recommendation of proper diets, better nutrition,\nor healthier food alternatives.\n\u2022 Drug recommendation: Drug recommendation systems are designed to help patients and\nhealth-care professionals to identify medications for certain patient conditions or to predict\ndrug side-effects.\n\u2022 Health status prediction: Recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering can be\nleveraged to make better predictions of a patient's risk factors given their current health\nstatus.\n\u2022 Physical activity recommendation: Approaches in this area were for example developed to\nsuggest exercises or workouts to patients, e.g., to achieve their calorie burn goals or to\nperform their activities to improve sleep [96].\n\u2022 Healthcare professional recommendation: Recommender systems have also been developed\nto help patients find doctors with the best expertise for their health-related issues.\nA number of works in the literature cover additional topics that go beyond this classification,\ne.g., the recommendation of messages within a smoking cessation app [44]. Such works fall into\nthe more general category of behavior change support systems [63]. Some of the works in the\nliterature are also targeted at certain groups of people or patients, for instance, elderly [28, 40, 41]\nor people with autism [59], dementia [90], or social anxiety [1]. Today, many of the more recent\nhealth-related recommendation approaches are implemented as (smartphone) apps. This leads to\nadditional research questions beyond those related to the core recommendation task. The credibility\nof a health-related app is for example, important for the adoption of the recommendation, as\nanalyzed in [64]. Also there are often ethical aspects to consider, in particular in the context of\nmental health apps [74, 97]. Of course, it is often highly important to limit the risks of inadequate\nrecommendations in such a critical domain. This can for example be achieved by providing adequate\nexplanations alongside recommendations, and by leaving the final decision of the chosen health\nintervention to the medical expert [17].\nGenerally, health recommender systems is an active research area, as also evidenced by a series\nof health-related workshops held in conjunction with the ACM RecSys conference5. The literature\non the topic is however quite scattered across various publication outlets, see also the survey on\nrecommenders for digital health in [11]. Various works in this area are published in computer\nscience outlets, others in medical journals, indicating the potential for more interdisciplinary\nresearch."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Educational Recommender Systems and e-Learning", "content": "Another quite active and established ap-\nplication domain for RS4Good is the use of recommendation technology to support human/student\nlearning processes, e.g., in the form of course recommendations or learning paths suggestions in\ne-learning environments. Works in this area fall into the broader category of 'AI in education',\nwhich is of UNESCO's focus topics. Also, e-learning recommendations represent one form of\nTechnology-enhanced Learning (TEL) [23].\nSeveral types of items can be recommended in e-learning recommender systems, including\ncourses and course paths, college majors, papers, web pages, lessons and various other learning\nresources. Various types of traditional recommendation algorithms-both content-based, collab-\norative filtering and hybrid ones\u2014have been explored in the literature [51]. In some approaches,\nthe recommendation of learning activities (and materials) is based on predicting the student's\nperformance on a task that she or he has not solved yet. Given these predictions, the set of recom-\nmendations is then determined based on the e-learning system's specific goals. For example, the\nsystem could recommend materials that the student assumedly will like and most probably will be\nable to master. Following the exact opposite strategy, the system may however also recommend\nmaterials where it assumes gaps in the student's knowledge.\nAn in-depth discussion of the challenges of building e-learning recommender systems can be\nfound in [51]. A recommender system not only has to understand the learning goals and the prior\nknowledge of the student, it has also to take into account personal characteristics, such the student's\nlearning strategy. Moreover, recommendations must be made at the right point in time and within an\nappropriate interactive tool environment. Generally, technology-enhanced learning processes and\neducational recommender systems are a multi-faceted topic, and research in this direction usually\nrequires an interdisciplinary approach [3]. Furthermore, the evaluation of e-learning recommender\nsystems remains difficult. As mentioned above, depending on the system's goal and strategy, one\nor the other type of learning content may be appropriate and a good recommendation for a given\nstudent. Furthermore, the true success of the system, i.e., if the student's knowledge or learning\nprocess, was improved, can usually only be evaluated from a longitudinal perspective."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Individual Development, Wellbeing and Safety", "content": "Besides healthcare and education, a number\nof works address alternative ways of how recommender systems can contribute to individual\ndevelopment and wellbeing of users. Some of these works are related to personal health aspects,\ne.g., works by Elsweiler et al. [27], who evaluate how recommender systems can nudge users to\nchoose healthier recipes such as dishes with more favorable nutritional characteristics on food-\nfocused online sites. A related study on the role of nutrition labels on food choices can be found\nin [87]. A more general approach to support personal wellbeing with recommender systems was\nproposed by Gryard et al. in [39]. Their work is motivated by the increased availability of sensors on\nInternet-of-Things wearable devices that can measure physiological signals. In their system, these\nsensor signals are fed into a rule-based reasoning engine that recommends actions to (re-)achieve\n'happiness', e.g., do physical activities, increase the intake of certain natural products, or apply\nprocedures from alternative medicine. A related IoT-based approach for improved mental health\nwas later proposed by the authors in [38]. Unfortunately, no evaluation with real users has been\nperformed for these approaches yet.\nRecreational sport is often considered to be an important contributor to wellbeing. The use of\nrecommendation technology and machine learning techniques for amateur marathon runners was\nfor example proposed in Smyth et al. [85]. The primary recommendation tasks in their approach\nrange from the suggestion of personalized training plans to pacing strategies and the prediction\nof realistic finish-times. Secondary use cases for runners include the selection of running events,\nrunning routes, training partners, gear and equipment as well as advice regarding nutrition and\nrecovery. In [85], a number of these uses cases for recommendation technology are discussed in\nmore depth. The evaluation of the proposed approaches was however largely limited to offline\nexperiments so far.\nGoing beyond the realm of sports and health, Knijnenburg et al. [52] propose to develop a new\nclass of recommender systems for self-actualization. Instead of just recommending the \u201cbest\u201d items\nto users, such systems are designed to \u201csupport users in developing, exploring, and understanding\ntheir own unique tastes and preferences.\u201d As a consequence, future recommender systems for self-\nactualization should help users break out of filter bubbles and rather support instead of replace\nthem in their decision-making tasks. A possible experiment to evaluate such a recommender system\nwas later outlined in [101]. The results from a user study in the news recommendation domain\nare discussed in [93]. In this study, it was found that the reading intention of the participants\nare influenced by their stated self-actualization goals, which could either be Broaden Horizons or\nDiscover the Unexplored.\nAs a final example in the context of individual development, wellbeing and safety we consider\nrecommender technology contributing to personal safety. Specifically, a number of approaches have\nbeen proposed to recommend privacy settings to users in the online sphere. An early work [35] on\nrecommending privacy settings on Facebook was based on categorizing users into different groups\naccording to their assumed privacy values. A more elaborate technical approach to recommend\nimage sharing settings was later proposed in [103]. A particularity of this work is that the content\nitself, i.e., the images, are analyzed for content sensitiveness. Later on, the work in [78] aims at\nconsidering the user's disclosure preferences while protecting their privacy. A specific model for\nthe domain of fitness devices can be found in [79]."}, {"title": "2.2.4 Societal and Political Development", "content": "A number of RS4Good use cases can be identified that\ntarget at the societal or political development of a society as a whole. In the context of public opinion\nformation, for instance, recommender systems are nowadays widely employed on news sites and\nsocial media channels. While news recommender systems can be valuable both for consumers and\nproviders, they are often associated with potential problems such as the creation of filter bubbles\nor leading to polarization. RS4Good initiatives, as indicated above, should however go beyond\navoiding potential harm via responsible media recommendation [26]. Instead, they may, for instance,\naim at supporting a societal editorial mission or a given service mandate as many public European\nbroadcasters do. In [12], a discussion of challenges of building a recommender system for the British\nBroadcasting Corporation (BBC) can be found. Gr\u00fcn and Neufeld in [37] highlight the importance\nof transparency, fairness and exploration goals for the public German media service ZDF. Related\ndiscussions can be found in [84], where authors advocate for participatory design practices and\nopen data to address some of the challenges of digital public services.\nAlso going beyond the goal of merely avoiding harm, Lu et al. [56] conduct an online study in\nthe news domain to assess how personalized recommendations influence the reading behavior of\nusers in the context of editorial values, like diversity and coverage. Furthermore, an intervention\nstudy reveals that a re-ranking algorithm is effective to steer readers to a more dynamic reading\nbehavior without a loss of accuracy. In a related work, Diakopoulos et al. [20] more generally\ndiscuss the importance of considering professional ethics when designing responsible AI-based\nsolutions for journalism. Furthermore, Bauer et al. review the consideration of journalistic values7\nin news recommender systems [4].\nAlso in the realm of social media, personalization and recommender systems are often assumed to\nbe the cause of echo chambers, filter bubbles and polarization [22, 91]. Donkers et al. [22] investigate\nthe phenomenon of \u2018dual' echo chambers with an agent-based modeling and simulation approach.\nTheir study reveals that counteracting the two types of echo chambers requires different proactive\ndiversification and depolarization strategy. In a similar vein, Stray [91] studies how to design\nrecommender systems for depolarization. Diversification of the presented content is considered as\none possible strategy that can work against polarization in some context, but it may even make\nthings worse. According to [91], recommenders should generally be designed to deprioritize content\nthat is found to be polarizing as well as polarization measures should be incorporated into systems\nand continuously monitored.\nWhile the news and social media domains are key use cases for recommender systems, there\nare various other scenarios where recommender systems can support societal development. In the\neducational sector, for example, Wilson et al. [102] propose an online recommender system that is\nparticularly designed to help families of low socioeconomic status to select an appropriate school\nthat matches parents' preferences and the students' needs and abilities. In the same educational\nrealm, Milton et al. [62] develop a book recommender system for kids that aims at increasing their\nreading interest and literacy.\nA number of further research works aim at fostering societal development and political en-\ngagement through recommender systems in terms of supporting e-participation [8, 80] or e-\ngovernance [13] processes. Furthermore, the authors of [21] propose a recommender system to\nincrease social cohesion by enabling each member of the community to feel that they are part of the\ncultural heritage of society. Cultural content recommendations are also in the focus of the work\nby Ferraro et al. [32], who propose a measure that reflects to what extent recommendation will\nfamiliarize a given user population with certain content categories.\nFinally, we mention two examples of works that may lead to a positive and socially desirable\neconomic development in quite different ways. First, Pourashraf and Mobasher [69] target the\nnews recommendation domain and argue that readers' local news interests are different from their\npreferences for global news. Thus, by differentiating between local and global news preferences\ntheir localized recommendation model increased prediction accuracy with the ultimate goal to\nrevitalize and strengthen local media companies. The second work from Liu et al. [55] target the\ndomain of micro-lending, an approach to provide citizens in impoverished countries with access to\ncapital. In their work, the authors propose a fairness-aware model that aims to ensure that different\ndemographic groups have a fair chance of being recommended for a micro-loan."}, {"title": "2.2.5 Environment Protection and Sustainability", "content": "A diverse set of approaches to build recommender\nsystems for good' can be found in this category. An early work in this area represents Knijnenburg\net al. [53], who develop a system to recommend energy-saving measures to users. They specifically\nexplore the impact of different preference elicitation methods on user satisfaction, which in turn\ninfluences behavior outcomes. The recommendation of energy-saving measures is also in the\nfocus of the work by Starke et al. [88]. In their work, they analyze the effectiveness of different\npsychology-informed ways of presenting recommendations to users in a persuasive way.\nThe reduction of emissions is a central target in other works as well, e.g., in the area of travel\nand tourism. Bothos et al. [7], for instance, design a persuasive travel recommender system that\nnudges users to adopt greener transportation habits. A number of other research works aims at\nimplementing smart mobility through recommender systems in the context of smart cities, e.g.,\nby promoting the use of public transport and non-motorized mobility options, the reduction of\ntraffic congestions, or addressing parking management problems, see [70]. A number of additional\nrecommender systems use cases for smart cities are discussed in [71], where authors argue that\nfuture systems have a higher likelihood of intent-awareness [48] due to novel technological enablers\nsuch as Sensors and Internet-of-Things.\nOther recent works in recommender systems focus on sustainability in different dimensions.\nConnected to the previously discussed applications in travel and tourism, Piliponyte et al. [68]\npropose a simulation-based approach to study the effects of personalized advertisement campaigns\non tourist choices. A main goal of their work is to support decision-makers in running such\ncampaigns with the goal of avoiding overtourism, which may often lead to natural damage. Avoiding\novercrowding at certain places is also the focus of the work of Patro et al. [67]. The goal of their multi-\nobjective recommendation approach is to ensure a better and fairer distribution of businesses, such\nas restaurants, cafes, or malls, appearing in recommendations, thereby supporting the sustainability\nof local businesses and the safety of their visitors.\nFinally, a larger body of research works targets at promoting environmental protection and\nsustainability through recommender systems in the agricultural domain [66]. Various smart agricul-\nture use cases can be identified in the literature, including crop recommendation based on various\nvariables related to weather and soil condition, fertilizer recommendation, crop protection and\npesticide recommendation or irrigation management. While the literature in this area is rich, we\nnote that most of the proposed recommendation approaches are non-personalized. Thus, they are\nmainly applications of machine learning models for prediction purposes [54] or optimization-based\nsolutions for improved decision support."}, {"title": "3 RS4GOOD: SHIFTING OUR RESEARCH FOCUS", "content": "Our brief overview in Section 2 demonstrates that already a multitude of RS4Good use cases have\nbeen explored in literature. However, the amount of works that focus on RS4Good-related topics\nis negligible compared to the extensive body of literature devoted to proposing new algorithms\nexclusively evaluated offline on the few datasets from the media and e-commerce domains. We recall\nhere that there is nothing wrong with research in these areas, and that such research may also fall\ninto the scope of RS4Good. E-commerce recommendations can for example be designed to promote\nmore sustainable products, and a music recommender system's design may target at increasing the\nexposure of artists from minority groups. Thus, we iterate that whether a recommender systems\nserves a 'for good' purpose or not rather depends on the design goals of the system than on the\napplication area. However, not many works in the literature address such \u2018for good' purposes in\nthis way.\nThe question thus arises why we as a research community do not devote our efforts on research\nthat matters and fosters societal development, instead of continuing to propose increasingly complex\nmachine learning models that we evaluate in terms of their capability to accurately predict held-out\ndata points that derive primarily from the entertainment domain. And even worse, we do so while\nknowing that various field tests and user studies tell us that increases in offline accuracy may in\nmany cases not translate into better value for consumers or businesses [5, 15, 25, 33, 46, 58, 60].\nGiven all this evidence for this offline-online gap and many voices from industry, it may actually\nturn out that much of our research on improving accuracy metrics in offline experiments may be\nalmost entirely worthless in practice.\nOne part of the answer to the question above may be as simply as this: that it is much easier to\ndo algorithm-oriented research based on offline experiments than to do RS4Good research. Typical\nRS4Good research can have certain ingredients that may be considered challenging. Usually, one\nneeds to understand the idiosyncrasies of the particular use case, commonly leading to a need\nfor interdisciplinary research. Moreover, the evaluation of RS4Good recommender systems can\nbe demanding, as typically a human-centric research approach is required. Moreover, the aspired\npositive societal impacts can many times only be assessed in a longitudinal perspective. Research\nbased on offline experiments does not face these challenges. Researchers can, for instance, try out\nvarious variants of a newly developed algorithm in a largely automated way without the need\nto involve humans in experiments. However, the predominant use of offline experimentation in\ncombination problematic offline evaluation practices may have led to a certain level of stagnation\nin our field."}, {"title": "3.1 Offline Evaluation Practices and the Need for a Crisis", "content": "Having said that conducting research based on offline evaluations may be often easier than RS4Good\nresearch does not necessarily imply that it is actually easy to get an algorithm paper published in\na top-level outlet. It requires inspiration for a novel technical idea, a working implementation,\nsometimes a non-trivial mathematical exposition and analysis, as well as in-depth experimental\nevaluations, which, most recently have become increasingly computationally expensive.\nNevertheless offline evaluation practices might be perceived less effort than RS4Good research\ninvolving humans in the loop. In offline evaluation, the evaluation procedures and metrics are to\nsome extent standardized, whereas in user studies every single aspect of the proposed experimental\ndesign may need to be defended against reviewers. Furthermore, in offline experiments, there\nare many degrees of freedom regarding the experimental configuration that is used as a basis to\ndemonstrate an advance with respect to the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d. Researchers have some freedom\nwhen selecting baselines, evaluation datasets, preprocessing steps, data-splitting techniques, as\nwell as evaluation metrics and even cut-off values for the metrics [47]. Given this freedom, and\nknowing about the possible existence of confirmation bias\u2014where the expectation is that the\nproposed method works well-researchers might unknowingly focus on very specific experimental\nconfigurations supporting this bias.\nAs such, it is not too surprising that a number of studies in recent years have revealed that\nthe progress that we make in terms of algorithms that lead to better offline accuracy results may\nactually be quite limited. Quite worrying, these studies show that often decade-old methods or\nconceptually simple techniques based on nearest-neighbor search can outperform even the latest\nneural models [30, 31, 57, 61, 72, 73, 82]. One main reason for this phantom progress [31] lies in\nthe apparently common practice of benchmarking a newly proposed and meticulously fine-tuned\nmodel against baselines that were not particularly tuned for the given dataset(s). Obviously, nothing\nmeaningful can be concluded from such an experimental setup [81]. Other reasons may include the\nuse of incorrect or incomplete re-implementations of baseline models, tuning of models on test\ndata, the use of datasets that are not suited for the task, using the same hyperparameters for all\ncompared models 'for fair comparison', or reporting the best accuracy values for different metrics\nacross different epochs, see also [42, 43, 94].\nFurthermore, the general level of reproducibility of reported research results turns out to be quite\nlimited as well. While sharing code and data has become more common over the past few years, the\nmajority of published research works do not publicly provide the necessary resources to reproduce\nthe numbers that are reported in the papers [9, 31, 48]. This is by no means a novel insight, as\nsimilar observations on the reproducibility of information retrieval and recommender systems\nhave been made over the past 15 years [2, 77]. As the awareness of this problem increases, more\nand more conferences and journals nowadays provide reproducibility guidelines and encourage\nauthors to share resources. It is nonetheless today still uncommon that papers come with a complete\nreproducibility package that includes all necessary materials such as the pre-processed datasets, the\ncode of the proposed model and the baselines, information about hyperparameter tuning, detailed\ndocumentation and so forth.\nEnsuring reproducibility unfortunately however only solves parts of the problems we face\nwith offline experimentation. Let us assume that for a given paper the research methodology is\ncorrect and that all resources are shared for reproducibility. We may still need to ask what we can\nconclude from an offline evaluation that reports a few percentages of accuracy improvements over\npreviously existing models on three academic datasets. Given the above-mentioned observations of\nan offline-online gap, probably not too much. Industry reports from companies like Netflix and\nCoveo mention the limited predictive power of offline tests, sometimes indicating that practitioners\noften are \u201cshooting in the dark\u201d [36, 75, 76] in only a slightly informed way. Clearly, there are\nways in which offline experiments can be helpful. Such experiments might be used to rule out\nmodels that perform very poorly offline. Furthermore, one can exploit offline tests to analyze certain\ncharacteristics of generated recommendations, e.g., in terms of diversity or popularity bias, and\nthen decide which model might suit the given application use case best.\nOverall, despite the apparent limitations of offline experiments, still most of the efforts of the\ncommunity are directed at finding models that lead to small accuracy increases on a limited\ncollection of datasets. Unfortunately, there are no signs of a crisis in the sense of a \u2018turning point'\nyet [16], where we as a community reconsider what kind of problems we address and how we\nmake contributions that matter with the goal to impact the real-world in a positive manner."}, {"title": "3.2 Challenges and Barriers of RS4Good Research", "content": "When reconsidering the RS4Good use cases discussed in Sec-\ntion 2, we can observe that not many of them can be addressed with traditional offline evaluations.\nAs briefly indicated above, many use cases necessitate a research approach that is driven by the\nfollowing requirements.\n(1) Interdisciplinary: Many of the discussed RS4Good use cases require a deep understanding of\nthe particularities of a given domain.

In many of these cases, studies require humans in the loop in the evaluation\nprocess and measures (e.g., degree of health improvement or learning success) that measure\nthe impact of the interventions or recommendations on users.\n(3) Longitudinal Perspective: Considering again the examples of health interventions or e-\nlearning applications, the effects of recommendations may only become visible over a longer\nevaluation horizon, e.g., after several weeks of treatments or at the end of an academic year.\nLikewise, if we think of using recommendations as nudges [50] towards a desired behavior,\ne.g., in terms of healthy eating patterns, we must ensure that such behavior changes are\nsustainable.\nCertainly, not all RS4Good use cases may necessarily face all of these methodological challenges\nin parallel. There may always be certain types of research without involving humans, for instance,\nworks that are based on simulation approaches like the study in the tourism domain by Piliponyte\net al. [68] mentioned above.10 In general, however, research in RS4Good domains might often be\nmuch slower and effortful in terms of the required research design and the execution of experiments\nthan traditional offline evaluations. Moreover, research on RS4Good use cases, due to the need\nto consider domain specifics, may always face the criticism of focusing on a too narrow problem\nsetting, and the generalizability of the findings may be questioned. As a result RS4Good research\nmay suffer from a basic dilemma of recommender systems research. On the one hand, researchers\nin computer science generally strive to develop generalizable solutions, e.g., algorithms, that work\nfor a variety of use cases. On the other hand, there is a concrete danger that we overgeneralize and\nmake conclusions regarding the effectiveness of a new algorithm in practice based on a limited set\nof experiments and using a specific set of datasets and abstract, domain-agnostic computational\nmeasures."}, {}]}

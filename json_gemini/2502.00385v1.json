This is particularly crucial for content moderation systems, where biased models could disproportionately impact detection rates across different user groups, compromising the overall fairness of content moderation systems. While pretraining models on politically diverse corpora has been shown to improve downstream task fairness [2], this approach requires significant computational resources that are often inaccessible to many researchers and organizations.\nRecent work has explored persona-based prompting as a more accessible alternative for introducing diversity in model outputs. Fr\u00f6hling et al. [3] showed that injecting synthetic personas into prompts can increase data annotation diversity, while Bernardelle et al. [1] showed that this approach can be used to influence the original political viewpoint of LLMs. However, less attention has been paid to understanding how these political perspectives manifest in practical applications.\nOur work bridges this gap by investigating how persona-based prompting can influence real-world applications of LLMs in multimodal hate speech detection, specifically focusing on hateful memes. By having a model assume the perspective of different personas mapped to various points on the Political Compass Test (PCT) [2, 8], we examine whether their political positioning influences classification decisions for hate speech in memes. This methodology allows us to investigate whether this approach can achieve similar benefits to those observed in previous political pretraining approaches while being more computationally efficient and accessible.

Furthermore, while our investigation confirms that LLMs can display distinct political leanings when directly questioned about political topics, our results suggest that, when using persona-based prompting, these inherent biases play a small role in classification scenarios. However, since our study focused specifically on hate speech detection across a limited set of datasets, these findings may not generalize to other tasks where political biases could have stronger effects."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "LLM bias and downstream task fairness. Previous work has shown that political biases in LLMs can significantly impact fairness in downstream tasks. Feng et al. [2] showed that pretraining data's political orientation affects model performance in tasks like hate speech detection and misinformation classification, with models exhibiting different biases based on their training corpora. Their work revealed that models pretrained on politically diverse sources show varying patterns in how they treat different identity groups and partisan content. This suggests that LLMs encode and propagate political biases from their training data, which can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups or perspectives in practical applications. While pretraining on politically diverse data can help address these biases, such approaches often require substantial data and computational resources.\nPersona-based prompting. Recent work has explored persona-based prompting as a more accessible alternative for controlling model behavior and mitigating bias. Fr\u00f6hling et al. [3] introduced this approach to increase diversity in annotation tasks by injecting different persona descriptions into model prompts, showing that persona descriptions can help elicit a wider range of valid perspectives. Building on this, Bernardelle et al. [1] showed that persona-based prompting can effectively modulate models' political orientations without requiring expensive retraining. Their work revealed that carefully crafted persona prompts can shift model responses along the political spectrum, offering a promising method for achieving political diversity in language model outputs. This prompting-based approach provides a more flexible and resource-efficient way to control model behavior than pretraining-based methods, while still maintaining the ability to capture diverse political perspectives. While this body of work establishes the effectiveness of persona-based prompting, our work extends this research by evaluating how persona-based political perspectives influence performance on multimodal hateful content detection tasks."}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "Data. Our study utilizes three datasets: PersonaHub for synthetic personas, and both the Hateful Memes dataset and MMHS150K for evaluating persona-based moderation capabilities.\nWe employ the complete collection of 200,000 synthetic personas from PersonaHub [4], which is publicly available.\u00b9 We map these personas onto the PCT to understand their ideological distribution along social and economic axes, by assessing their political perspectives through 62 distinct statements across six domains. The Hateful Memes dataset [6] consists of 10,000 multimodal memes labeled as either hateful or non-hateful, with additional fine-grained annotations\u00b2 for protected groups and attack types provided separately by the dataset authors. Finally, MMHS150K [5] provides 150,000 manually annotated tweets across six categories of possible attacks.\nVision model. For our multimodal analysis, we utilize IDEFICS-3 [7], a Vision-Language Model (VLM) built on Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct architecture. This choice is motivated by its strong zero-shot performance on multimodal tasks and relatively small parameter count. Furthermore, its architecture, being based on Llama 3.1, allows for better consistency when comparing results with text-only experiments using similar model families.\nExperimental setup. Our experimental design consists of two studies. In Study 1, from the 200,000 personas we selected 60 (15 per quadrant) based on a scoring system that balanced positional extremity with ideological consistency (see Appendix A), as shown in Figure 1a. Using these personas, we conducted hateful content classification of 1,000 randomly selected memes from each dataset (Hateful Memes and MMHS150K) using standardized prompt templates (detailed in Appendix B). For each persona, we collected binary harm classification, targeted group identification, and attack method categorization.\nTo control for potential training data contamination, we replicated the experiment on the Hateful Memes test set, whose labels, to the best of our knowledge, are not publicly available, unlike those of MMHS150K.\nIn Study 2, we focused solely on economic left-right positioning by selecting a sample of 40 personas drawn from the economic extremes (20 each from leftmost and rightmost positions). We then amplified their political orientations by explicitly labeling each persona with its respective ideological leaning (i.e., making right-wing personas more explicitly right-wing and left-wing personas more explicitly left-wing). The choice of directly testing personas with explicitly labeled ideological leanings was motivated by Study 1's revelation of minimal correlation between political positioning and classification decisions. Study 2 thus served as a test of this finding, examining whether deliberately amplified personas could override the observed independence between political orientation and classification behavior.\nThis design allows us to evaluate both the baseline impact of political positioning on hate speech detection and the effect of explicit ideological manipulation while reducing the complexity of the annotation process by removing the social dimension from consideration.\nAgreement analysis. To quantify classification consistency across political orientations, we calculated pairwise Cohen's Kappa scores"}, {"title": "4 RESULTS", "content": "Vision model performance. Before analyzing agreement patterns between different personas, we first evaluated IDEFICS-3's hate speech detection capabilities when employing our persona-based prompting approach. This initial performance assessment is crucial, as meaningful analysis of persona agreement patterns requires the model to demonstrate competent classification abilities. To assess whether the introduction of personas impacts model performance, we also ran a baseline evaluation using standard classification prompts without personas. Both approaches achieved nearly identical performance (detailed in Appendix C), indicating that persona-based prompting preserves the model's classification capabilities. As shown in Table 1, IDEFICS-3 prompted with persona descriptions obtains strong performance on the Hateful Memes dataset, achieving high scores in harmfulness detection (accuracy: 0.908, F1: 0.890) and target identification (accuracy: 0.876, F1: 0.733), with performance gradually declining for more nuanced tasks like attack method classification (accuracy: 0.743, macro F1: 0.310). The model shows moderate performance on the MMHS150K dataset with accuracy scores around 0.5-0.6 across both tasks. While these results exceed random chance, the substantial drop in performance could stem from MMHS150K's broader scope and more nuanced content, making it a more demanding benchmark for hate speech detection.\nThese results shows that IDEFICS-3 can effectively perform hate speech detection while maintaining distinct persona-based perspectives, though with varying degrees of success across different tasks and datasets, providing a solid foundation for our main investigation into how these personas might agree or disagree in their classifications.\nStudy 1 - Persona Agreement. Our analysis of agreement between the 60 selected personas reveals surprisingly consistent classification behavior across political quadrants. For the Hateful Memes dataset, as shown in Figure 2a, we observe high agreement both within quadrants (mean Cohen's k = 0.863 \u00b1 0.032 SD) and between quadrants (mean Cohen's k = 0.851 \u00b1 0.015 SD). The minimal difference between intra- and inter-quadrant agreement suggests that a persona's political positioning has little influence on their classification decisions. Results from the MMHS150K dataset (Figure 2b) mirror these patterns, with comparable levels of agreement both within quadrants (diagonal mean k = 0.817, SD = 0.020) and between quadrants (off-diagonal mean k = 0.806, SD = 0.013). The consistency across the two datasets suggests that these agreement patterns might reflect genuine characteristics of persona-based classification rather than dataset-specific artifacts.\nFurthermore, when replicating our analysis on the Hateful Memes test set, we found nearly identical agreement patterns (diagonal mean = 0.831, off-diagonal mean = 0.828), indicating that the observed consistency in classification behavior is not due to model memorization of training data.\nThese findings suggest that persona-based prompting alone may not be sufficient to replicate the ideological influences on hate speech detection observed with political pretraining approaches. Despite clear differences in political positioning, personas demonstrate consistent classification behavior, suggesting that more direct interventions - such as specialized pretraining on politically diverse corpora - may be needed to impact how content is evaluated for harmfulness meaningfully. This raises important questions about"}, {"title": "", "content": "the limitations of prompt-based approaches compared to pretraining methods for achieving diverse classifications on hate speech detection tasks. While LLMs can display distinct political leanings when directly questioned about political topics, when using persona-based prompting, these inherent biases play a smaller role in classification scenarios than we initially expected.\nStudy 2 - Persona political injection. In Study 2, we examined whether explicit ideological amplification of economically left and right personas would increase divergence in classification behavior. For the Hateful Memes dataset, agreement levels remained high and uniform (right-leaning k = 0.906, left-leaning k = 0.879, inter-group k = 0.875), closely mirroring Study 1 and suggesting minimal impact of ideological reinforcement on classification.\nAnalysis of the MMHS150K dataset showed stronger intra-group cohesion compared to inter-group agreement. Right-leaning personas demonstrated the highest internal agreement (k = 0.859), followed by left-leaning personas (k = 0.849). The inter-group agreement was lower (k = 0.807). This distinction might be attributed to MMHS150K's broader scope and more nuanced content, which could provide more opportunities for ideological differences to manifest in classification decisions.\nNevertheless, the overall high agreement scores indicate that persona-induced political ideology, even when explicitly emphasized, plays a relatively minor role in hate speech detection.\nAgreement Patterns. To gain a deeper understanding of how agreement manifests between personas, we analyzed strong and weak agreement patterns across two experimental conditions. For the 60 personas distributed across all political quadrants (Figure 3, left panels), we observe no clear ideological clustering in agreement patterns. The highest agreement pairs (0.968 - 0.958) span both within and across quadrants, connecting ideologically distant personas just as frequently as ideologically aligned ones. Similarly, the weakest agreement pairs (0.609 - 0.517) show no consistent pattern with respect to political positioning, with low agreement occurring both within and between quadrants. This supports our earlier finding that political quadrant placement has minimal impact on classification decisions.\nHowever, when examining the 40 personas from economic extremes (Figure 3, right panels), a different pattern emerges. While we still observe a strong agreement between opposing economic positions (yellow line crossing between left and right), the majority of high-agreement pairs (0.974 - 0.964) cluster within their respective economic sides. We observe a similar pattern when examining weaker agreement pairs (0.752 - 0.657), where most instances of disagreement occur between personas from opposing economic positions. This suggests that while explicit economic positioning may not have a strong impact on classification behavior, it does introduce some systematic variation in agreement patterns that wasn't apparent in the more general political quadrant analysis."}, {"title": "5 CONCLUSION", "content": "Our research reveals that political ideology, when implemented through persona-based prompting, has minimal impact on hate speech detection in multimodal contexts. The study found consistent classification patterns across different political orientations, even when these orientations were deliberately emphasized. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms governing hate speech detection in LLMs may be deeply embedded in the model's training, and not really susceptible to prompt-based modification. Therefore, persona-based prompting may be insufficient for capturing ideological nuances in content moderation systems."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "The scope and generalizability of our findings are primarily constrained by our reliance on the IDEFICS-3 architecture and the two chosen datasets, and may not generalize to other models or different datasets. Additionally, our persona-based approach might not fully capture the complex decision-making patterns of human content moderators, mitigated by the fact that we are shifting the focus to political leaning instead of the specific persona descriptions. Furthermore, while we attempted to control for potential training data contamination by testing on held-out datasets, we cannot completely rule it out. Finally, the study relies heavily on Western political frameworks through the PCT, which may not fully capture ideological distinctions relevant to other cultural contexts."}, {"title": "Future Work", "content": "Future research could extend this work in several directions: 1) investigating whether our observations hold across different model architectures and sizes to establish the generalizability of our results; 2) examining how persona-based prompting influences other content moderation tasks; 3) conducting a direct experimental comparison between persona-based prompting and political pretraining methods to quantitatively assess their relative effectiveness in achieving politically diverse perspectives."}, {"title": "A PERSONA SELECTION METHODOLOGY", "content": "Our persona selection process aimed to identify individuals with well-defined political positions while maintaining representation across the political spectrum.

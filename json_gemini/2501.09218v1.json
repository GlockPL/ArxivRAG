Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has emerged as a gold standard for achieving absolute quantification. While computational ddPCR technologies have advanced significantly, achieving automatic interpretation and consistent adaptability across diverse operational environments remains a challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce the intelligent interpretable droplet digital PCR (I2ddPCR) assay, a comprehensive framework integrating front-end predictive models (for droplet segmentation and classification) with GPT-4o multimodal large language model (MLLM, for context-aware explanations and recommendations) to automate and enhance ddPCR image analysis. This approach surpasses the state-of-the-art models, affording 99.05% accuracy in processing complex ddPCR images containing over 300 droplets per image with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). By combining specialized neural networks and large language models, the I2ddPCR assay offers a robust and adaptable solution for absolute molecular quantification, achieving a sensitivity capable of detecting low-abundance targets as low as 90.32 copies/\u00b5L. Furthermore, it improves model's transparency through detailed explanation and troubleshooting guidance, empowering users to make informed decisions. This innovative framework has the potential to benefit molecular diagnostics, disease research, and clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained settings.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The quantification of nucleic acids is fundamental to molecular diagnostics, especially in the detection and management of infectious diseases such as malaria\u00b9, dengue\u00b2, tuberculosis\u00b3, and monkeypox\u2074. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a highly sensitive and precise method that partitions PCR reactions into thousands of picolitre droplets to detect low-abundance targets 5,6. It offers 2,000 times higher sensitivity compared to qPCR, enabling the detection of 1 mutant in 200,000 background wild-type genes without the need for standard curves7. This method has been instrumental in addressing global health challenges, including the rapid and reliable diagnosis of gene mutations 8-10 and diseases such as COVID-1911,12, HIV13, influenza 14, circulating tumor DNA 15-17.\nIn ddPCR, the copy number of target molecules is calculated by the fraction of the reaction units containing the target molecules, according to the Poisson distribution. Traditional ddPCR platforms face limitations such as high costs, operational complexity, and the need for manual data analysis, which can hinder widespread adoption and reproducibility18,19. Commercialized ddPCR platforms such as Bio-Rad's QX20020 and RainDance RainDrop TM21,22, while precise in detecting targets as low as 0.1%23, are expensive (> $18,000) and require specialized expertise for operation and data interpretation. High initial and recurring expenses may deter use, especially in budget- strapped labs 18,19. While flow cytometry stands as a revered 'gold standard' for cell analysis and sorting, it is less practical for ddPCR read-out24. The nature of ddPCR droplets, which are often water-in-oil emulsions, can pose significant incompatibility for flow cytometers optimized for aqueous samples. Meanwhile, maintaining ddPCR droplet integrity during flow cytometric analysis is challenging since shear forces that can cause coalescence, breakage, or deformation, resulting in sample loss and challenges for downstream analysis26. Manual fluorescence image analysis, reliant on software such as Image J25, Fiji26, and CellProfiler27, is labor-intensive and lacks scalability28,29. These manual or semi-automated data preprocessing steps, such as thresholding and noise reduction, are also labor-intensive and prone to errors, especially in low- quality images with weak signals24. Automated methods, though promising, struggle with variability in experimental conditions, noise, and artifacts, limiting their generalizability and reproducibility across different laboratories30,31.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including both machine learning and deep learning, have shown promise in automating and enhancing ddPCR image analysis32\u201335. AI-based methods, such as Attention DeepLabV3+ combined with circle Hough transform, achieve over 97% accuracy in droplet detection and classification, even in low-quality ddPCR images36. Another study employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), achieving a remarkable 99.71% accuracy in classifying positive droplets37. A few-shot training technique requiring less dataset was applied for higher effectiveness38. By employing the YOLOv3 model, an accuracy of 98.98% was obtained while reducing the labeling time by 70% compared to the Mask R-CNN and YOLO models. Moreover, the strong generalized capability of neural networks has been validated in various ddPCR scenarios. Employing YOLOv5 and an RPN (Region Proposal Networks) model, the Deep-qGFP model has achieved precise and automated quantification of green fluorescence profiler-labeled droplets with an accuracy higher than 96.23% and a swift detection speed of 2.5 seconds per image39. Moreover, its strong generalized capability has been validated in various"}, {"title": "2. Results", "content": "Workflow and Experimental Setup\nFigure 1 provides a detailed overview of the workflow. For the initial demonstration, we adopted Seahorse (Hippocampus kuda) genome extracts, specifically the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region (206 bp amplicon size), as the target template DNA. Serial dilutions (0.4 pg, 4 pg, and 40 pg within a 20 \u00b5L PCR mixture) were prepared for droplet generation, as summarized in Figure 1a (reagent details can be found in Materials and Methods). For each template, ~20,000 monodispersed droplets were generated (56.90 \u00b1 0.55 \u00b5m in diameter, equivalent to a volume of 96.47 pL) using a customized lab-on-a-chip system. The droplets were collected into PCR tubes and then amplified inside a PCR amplifier for 45 cycles to achieve sufficient amplification. After the thermocycling process, SYBR Green dye was added and ~2,000 droplets were placed into a PDMS chip for observation. Spatial-lapse imaging was performed using a high-resolution FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) fluorescence microscope to capture both bright-field images and fluorescence images.\nTo ensure the diversity of the testing dataset and avoid data leakage, we prepared ddPCR images using 9 distinct biological samples with variations in template and primer sequence design (see Materials and Methods for details). Disposable microfluidic chips with the same geometry were applied to avoid cross-contamination. Droplet size and uniformity were adjusted by fine- tuning the flow speeds of water phase and oil phase. For each sample, consistent imaging conditions, including focusing, fluorescence intensity, and magnification, were maintained. To ensure interframe continuity and image representativeness, we employed random sampling and avoided droplets overlapping."}, {"title": "Ground Truth Validation and Image Analysis", "content": "To establish a reliable ground truth, the captured images were manually annotated by trained laboratory personnel with expertise in digital PCR and image analysis. These annotations were performed using Roboflow, designed for precise object segmentation and classification. The droplet diameter measurement was performed using the software ImageJ (National Institutes of Health and the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation). To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the ground truth, the annotations were cross-checked by a separate group of experts who independently reviewed and verified the labels.\nFigure 1b-f illustrate the MLLM-ddPCR model processing steps. The model integrates three main modules: the segmentation network (s-net), the classification network (c-net), and the MLLM. Upon inputting bright-field and fluorescence images (Figure 1b), the s-net segments droplets, while the c-net classifies them as positive (red) or negative (blue) based on fluorescence intensity (Figure 1c). Metrics include 'diameter/(\u00b5m)', and 'confidence score', with higher scores indicating more reliable classification. Simultaneously, droplet diameter was measured to calculate droplet volume and evaluate uniformity (Figure 1d). The MLLM generates context-aware explanation of the results, including droplet counts, size distribution, and concentration factor \u03bb (Figure 1e, calculation details see Materials and Methods). Specifically, for high template concentrations (\u03bb > 1), mathematical corrections are applied using $P_4(X = 2)$. The model also provides optimization and troubleshooting advice correspondingly (Figure 1f). The whole process is shown in a custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI, Supplementary Figure 1)."}, {"title": "Comparison with State-of-the-Art Models", "content": "Figure 4 compares MLLM-ddPCR with SOTA models (SAM-dPCR and Deep-qGFP). SAM- dPCR model is developed by incorporating zero-shot SAM and Otsu's method for auto- thresholding 40. Deep-qGFP model was trained using a YOLO-v5m model and the Region Proposal Network (RPN) on over 200 manually labeled ddPCR datasets44. MLLM-ddPCR achieves 99.04% accuracy (Supplementary Table 6), outperforming Deep-qGFP (96.23%) and SAM-dPCR (97.10%). As shown in Figure 4a, MLLM-ddPCR accurately estimated droplet diameter with an average deviation of 1.473 pixels, surpassing 6.368 pixels for Deep-qGFP and 1.567 pixels for SAM-dPCR. We systematically altered image SNRs by introducing Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise (Figure 4b). MLLM-ddPCR maintained higher precision (96.00% to 100.00%), compared to Deep-qGFP (83.01% to 85.41%) and SAM-dPCR (53.33% to 95.83%). Detailed experiment records for Figure 4a and 4b can be found in Supplementary Figure S12a and b, respectively.\nMLLM-ddPCR also demonstrated robustness against fluorescence noise, such as dust and air bubbles, with negligible impact on segregation accuracy. We intentionally introduced known amounts of dust (Supplementary Figure S4b) and air bubbles (Supplementary Figure S4a1 and S4a2), finding no detectable impact on segregation accuracy. Neither contaminant was detected in the results, confirming their negligible effect. Moreover, we observed negligible spatial variations in background signal and found that the exposure could tolerate a certain degree of light transmission loss. For routine background signal evaluations, MLLM-ddPCR employs disposable microfluidic chips. As part of the LoD testing, we evaluated the performance of MLLM-ddPCR across various input sizes (1024\u00d71024 to 96\u00d796 pixels). While the system supports this wide range, resolutions below 256\u00d7256 pixels were found to compromise full image detection (Supplementary Figure S5). The optimal resolutions for accurate analysis were determined to be 1024\u00d71024 or 512\u00d7512 pixels, corresponding to an active area of 1.264 \u00d7 1.264 mm\u00b2 after edge exclusion.\nMLLM-ddPCR achieved 97.93% mean average precision (mAP) at different thresholds of intersection over union (IoU), which quantifies the overlap between a predicted bounding box or segmentation mask and its corresponding ground truth annotation (Figure 4c). The fluorescence- intensity-responsive classifier's performance was tested on a dataset containing 302 positive and 302 negative droplet objects. It also reveals 97.35% total classification accuracy, with 97.08% and 99.27% accuracies for positive and negative classes, respectively (confusion matrix in Figure 4d). A detailed breakdown of MLLM-ddPCR's runtime is provided in Figure 4e. The process includes: (1) reading images from the fluorescence microscope's application programming interface (API) or software development kit (SDK) cable (0.006 seconds per image), (2) segmenting and classifying droplets (4.51 and 0.33 seconds per image, respectively), (3) plotting results (0.83 seconds per image), and (4) outputting results into a designated folder (0.04 seconds per image)."}, {"title": "Troubleshooting and Optimization of Experimental Conditions Enabled by MLLM- ddPCR", "content": "Figure 5 demonstrates the MLLM-ddPCR model's capability for troubleshooting and optimizing ddPCR experimental conditions. Initially, the model identifies the input ddPCR image (Figure 5a1, sample concentration of 2.00 pg/\u00b5L) as problematic since the positive ratio is 43.64 and a is 0.21. Under this condition, the positive ratio as well as a is too high for accurate quantification. The model's explanation suggests lowering the template concentration to address this issue. Following the model's advice, the experiment is adjusted to a lower template concentration of 0.2 pg/\u00b5L, resulting in a new ddPCR image Figure 5a2. The model's subsequent explanation of Figure 5a2 confirms the successful correction, with a positive ratio of 1.84% and A of 0.02. Similarly, the initial ddPCR image Figure 5b1 shows uniform droplets, which was attributed to droplet merging during generation and amplification processes in MLLM-ddPCR explanation. The model highlights the need for fine-tuning the droplet generation process, prompting an enhanced droplet uniformity (\"droplet formation is consistent\") in Figure 5b2. This iterative feedback mechanism demonstrates the model's ability to provide actionable insights, optimizing ddPCR protocols for accuracy and reliability, thereby advancing molecular diagnostics."}, {"title": "Reliability and Generalizability Testing", "content": "We tested the reliability of MLLM-ddPCR by yielding linear regressions between known concentration and positive ratios. Figure 6a shows the results of detecting templates of different concentrations. The analysis results yielded inferred concentrations ranging from 0.27 to 2.50 \u00d7 103 copies \u00b5L-1. A strong linearity of r\u00b2 = 0.9994 was observed. Here r\u00b2 represents the coefficient of determination, computed using the standard formula for linear regression (see Methods). Output plots for each input image can be found in Supplementary Figure S13 and S14). MLLM- ddPCR also exhibits robust generalization capabilities when directly applied to different dPCR scenarios without training. As demonstrated in Figure 6b, MLLM-ddPCR has been validated with hydrogel-based ddPCR images with serial dilutions of harvested S. Typhi DNA at 24000, 1500, 600, and 300 times. The linear regressions between known concentration and positive ratio yields an r\u00b2 value of 0.9948. Specifically, the results for Figure 6a and b have been cross validated by comparing with manual counting results in Supplementary Table 7. These results demonstrate our model's generalizability and versatility, highlighting its potential to accelerate the identification of therapeutic targets and biomarkers."}, {"title": "3. Conclusions", "content": "In summary, we present the I2ddPCR assay facilitated by the MLLM-ddPCR model, which signifies a substantial progression in the realm of ddPCR data explanation. Our model's ability to segment and classify droplets, calculate DNA template concentrations using Poisson statistics, and evaluate image quality demonstrates its versatility and robustness. Integrated with MLLM, MLLM-ddPCR model offers an automated, comprehensive solution beyond mere quantification, providing insightful image analyses, experimental condition appraisals, and diagnostic guidance. MLLMs excel in processing vast amounts of information, identifying patterns and correlations that may elude human analysts. Their training on diverse datasets enables them to adapt to various ddPCR image characteristics and experimental conditions. Additionally, MLLMs provide context- aware explanations by integrating metadata about the experimental setup, such as reagents and target sequences. This enhances the accuracy of size distribution assessments and boosts the reliability of classification confidence metrics.\nThe comprehensive outputs, including detailed image explanations and experimental condition evaluations, empower researchers to make more informed decisions and optimize their ddPCR protocols. The benchmarking results against human expert analysis and state-of-the-art ddPCR image analysis models further validate MLLM-ddPCR's superior accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility. Our demonstration shows wide-ranging DNA intercalating dye-labeling scenarios and extends across agarose-based dPCR experiments. Based on this, we believe that our method has strong generalizability for learning other droplet microfluidics-enabled molecular diagnostic patterns, such as digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (dLAMP)45-47, digital recombinase polymerase amplification (dRPA)48-51, and droplet-based bacteria quantification52,53. As we continue to refine and expand the capabilities of our model, we anticipate that MLLM- ddPCR will become an indispensable tool for researchers seeking to harness the full potential of ddPCR technology. By integrating with other nucleic acid sensors54, signal amplification biosensors55, and point-of-care-testing (POCT) platforms such as smartphone-based portable ddPCR devices56-58, I2ddPCR could form a cohesive platform that streamlines the entire research workflow. This deep-learning-enabled ddPCR analysis assay can be used with various molecular diagnostic assays and might help expedite research in disease detection and treatment development. Our method allows diagnostic consistency and cost-effective system deployment to meet clinically demanding needs, for example in a cloud-based host for providing objective second opinions and consensus in resource-limited areas. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into an agentic Al framework [NMI paper] to enhance the autonomy of ddPCR analysis. This integration allows AI agents to access a variety of tools and collaborate in a multi-agent environment, fostering collective intelligence. For instance, within an agentic framework, our method can connect to laboratory information management systems (LIMS), facilitating real-time data tracking, analysis, and reporting. As we continue to refine and expand the capabilities of the MLLM-ddPCR model, we envision its integration into broader molecular diagnostic workflows, enabling seamless collaboration with other AI-driven tools and point-of-care platforms to revolutionize disease detection, treatment development, and personalized medicine."}, {"title": "4.

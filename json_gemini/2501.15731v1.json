The inherent variability of renewable sources and the complexity of prediction methods require robust approaches, such as DL models, in the renewable energy sector. DL models are preferred over traditional machine learning (ML) because they capture complex, nonlinear relationships in renewable energy datasets. This study examines key factors influencing DL technique accuracy, including sampling and hyperparameter optimization, by comparing various methods and training/test ratios within a DL framework. Seven machine learning methods-LSTM, Stacked LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, DNN, Time-Distributed MLP (TD-MLP), and Autoencoder (AE)-are evaluated using a dataset combining weather and photovoltaic power output data from 12 locations. Regularization techniques such as early stopping, neuron dropout, and L1/L2 regularization are applied to address overfitting. The results demonstrate that the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L1 regularization provides the best performance to reduce overfitting in the CNN and TD-MLP models with larger training set, while the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L2 regularization is the most effective to reduce the overfitting in CNN-LSTM and AE models with smaller training set.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The rapid growth of renewable energy-generated electricity reflects society's increasing environmental awareness [1-3]. Integrating renewable sources into the electrical grid requires accurate cost and reliability predictions. These predictions enable developers and investors to understand economic benefits, secure project financing, and make informed decisions. Additionally, they enhance grid resilience through optimized maintenance, improved power production forecasting, and ensured system stability.\nForecasting renewable energy output is challenging due to its inherent variability and unpredictability. However, accurate forecasting is crucial for effective energy management, grid stability, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [4]. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML) technologies, including Neural Networks, Time Series Analysis, Tree-based Methods, Ensemble Methods, and Deep Learning (DL), can analyze historical data to produce accurate energy output estimates.\nDL has demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet it faces significant challenges that prevent its widespread adoption and effectiveness. These challenges include data scarcity, model interpretability, computational demands, generalization to unseen data, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts-issues that require innovative solutions to ensure DL's reliability and accessibility in critical applications. Overcoming these obstacles requires hybrid techniques, access to high-quality datasets, and advanced model architecture. These limitations motivate us to ask the following questions:\nRQ1: How do different DL architectures compare in terms of their susceptibility to overfitting?\nRQ2: Are there architecture-specific regularization techniques that outperform general methods for certain types of neural networks?\nTo address these questions, we propose an analytics framework integrating various DL algorithms with and without regularization approaches. The proposed framework aims to determine critical factors affecting the reliability and availability of renewable energy output forecasts. It combines DL with sampling techniques to mitigate methodology-driven bias, a common limitation in existing algorithms. The study also employs four regularization approaches to address overfitting in DL models and analyzes the trade-off between overfitting and accuracy. The framework effectively captures non-linear relationships between energy production and various factors, including weather and seasonality. This is the first study to evaluate multiple DL models on renewable energy output forecasts and deploy four regularization approaches to eliminate the overfitting issue of DL models.\nThe paper proceeds with a theoretical background, followed by an overview of DL methods and experimental analyses comparing various DL techniques, and concludes with findings and future research directions."}, {"title": "2 Theoretical Background", "content": "ML methods have proven effective in energy system planning, reliability, and security.

It includes 17 features and 21,045 samples, with independent variables such as panel power output, wind speed, date, season, sampling time, location,"}, {"title": "4 Results and Discussion", "content": "Applying DL techniques to forecast power output from photovoltaic panels at twelve locations yields similar accuracy and test ratios across methods. Overfitting was observed across the DL baseline models. Table 3 reports the overfitting of seven DL baseline models using error metrics at different sample sizes. Our analysis shows that the test set sample size selection significantly influences overfitting in DL models. With a 20% test set size, five out of seven DL models exhibited reduced overfitting, suggesting that an 80-20 train-test split may offer a good balance between sufficient training data and adequate model evaluation. However, when the test set size was increased to 50%, all baseline models demonstrated clear signs of overfitting, as evidenced by diverging error metrics between training and test sets. This observation underscores the critical role of data sampling in model performance and generalization. The findings highlight the importance of carefully selecting train-test split ratios, as larger test sets can provide more robust evaluation metrics but may compromise model generalization, especially with limited data availability. Furthermore, the varying sensitivities of different DL architectures to split ratios suggest the need for future research to explore the relationship between model complexity, dataset characteristics, and optimal split ratios. These results emphasize the importance of a balanced approach to dataset partitioning, considering both comprehensive model evaluation and effective learning and generalization.\nFor instance, we examine the DNN model at a 10% sample size for overfitting regarding the best performance in the training set error metrics. Figure 1 illustrates the learning process for this model, revealing a clear overfitting trend.

The regularization techniques on seven DL models were evaluated on a public dataset using five different training/test split ratios, demonstrating their relative performance. The research addresses the need for a robust DL method applicable to multiple renewable energy-related scenarios. Prediction models performed exceptionally well when using regularization techniques. The test set sample size selection significantly influences overfitting in DL models. The combination of early stopping, dropout, and L1 regularization provides the best performance to reduce overfitting in the CNN and TD-MLP models with a larger training set. In contrast, the combination of early stopping, dropout, and L2 regularization is most effective in reducing the overfitting in the CNN-LSTM and AE models with a smaller training set.\nThe study highlights the importance of selecting regularization techniques and DL models tailored to dataset characteristics and prediction tasks."}]}

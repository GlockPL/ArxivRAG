The motifs that specifically engrossed us are derived from the tomb of I'timad-ud-Daula, situated in the city of Agra, close to the Taj Mahal. In an exploratory study, we designed nine interlaced metastructures inspired from the tomb's motifs. We fabricated the metastructures using additive manufacturing and studied their vibration characteristics experimentally and numerically. We also investigated bandgap modulation with metallic inserts in honeycomb interlaced metastructures. The comprehensive study of these metastructure panels reveals their high performance in controlling elastic wave propagation and generating suitable frequency bandgaps, hence having potential applications as waveguides for noise and vibration control. Finally, we developed novel AI-based model trained on numerical datasets for inverse design of metastructures with a desired bandgap.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Architectural intricate patterns have a long history, with certain examples dating back to the 4th century [1]. However, these early forms were the outcome of creative heuristic advancements of pattern generation in human civilization. It wasn't until the late 19th century, when fundamental physics became better understood, that the development of systematic engineering principles made it possible to explore counter-intuitive physical characteristics of some patterns in periodic structures, generally known as metamaterials and metastructures. Today, it is often proposed as a panacea for controlling attenuation and wavefront divergence related to elastic and electromagnetic wave propagation and there exists a vast literature of which are based on meticulously designed lattice structures with special geometric patterns [2-6]. These engineered lattices may introduce exotic mechanical and electromagnetic properties, manipulating the behavior of electromagnetic waves [7], elastic waves as well as sound waves [8-11]. By carefully designing these lattices, scientists can achieve extraordinary effects like negative stiffness [12], negative mass [13], and negative Poisson's ratio [14]. The study of lattice geometries in metamaterials opens a pathway to myriad innovative applications ranging from optics to acoustics, wearable devices [15, 16], advanced space structures [17, 18], next-gen automobiles [19, 20], robotic manipulators [21], bionic grippers, [22] and anti-seismic structures [23, 24]. These metamaterials exhibit characteristics such as high specific stiffness [25-28], negative Poisson's ratio [29, 30], negative thermal expansion coefficient [31], negative reflection [32, 33], wave alteration [34], sub-wavelength bandgap [35, 36] and distinctive electro-dynamic phenomena [37, 38]. The generation of a large range of novel periodic structures at different length scales has ushered in phenomenal developments of metamaterials."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Dynamic characterization and determination of the Bandgap\nSelected latticed metastructures (represented in Fig. 3), generated based on architectural elements (described in Fig. 2) have an overall size of 204 mm x 58 mm and a thickness of 5 mm. The size was carefully chosen keeping in mind the manufacturing constraints as well as the requirement of minimum number of periodic units (greater than 7 units) in the tessellated structure to express the metamaterial behavior [13]. On both sides, 15 mm solid frames are appended with the latticed structure in the longitudinal direction (see Supplementary Fig. S1) for ease of clamping and excitation during dynamic testing. For each latticed structure, there is a frequency band in which the structure may work as an attenuator signifying the absence of wave propagation, and the same is highlighted in Fig. 3. In the middle column (Fig. 3), we have shown the related mode shapes obtained using Ansys corresponding to minimum force transmissibility within the attenuation zone. Different structures have different damping ratios depending on the lattice geometry. The damping ratio is calculated by the half-power bandwidth method (highest for LS1 and the lowest for LS9), which is shown in the supplementary Fig. S11.\nLatticed metastructures with different sub-lattice structures are shown in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a-c) illus- trates the primary unit cells as honeycomb sub-lattice, single honeycomb, circular pattern of honeycomb cells and star structure respectively. In Figure 4(d), the primary unit cell has a chiral structure with sub-lattices exhibiting a spider web-like pattern. Furthermore, Fig. 4(e) features a primary unit cell as a ring structure interlaced with other ring structures. Figure 4(f) is a fishtail structure. Fig. 4(g) shows the primary unit cell as a series of honeycombs arranged to form a star at the center of the structure. Figure 4(h, i) are combinations of honeycomb and auxetic structure. In the former, these structures are present in a series combination, while in the latter, the auxetic structure is interlaced with the honeycomb structure. The dimensions of the unit cells are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. After creating all the metastructures of specified dimensions, we scaled them up by 1.5 and 2 respectively to capture the scale effect of unit cells in the wave transmission pattern. The scaling effect is illustrated with the help of the Band Gap (BG) ratio in the bar diagram (Fig. 4)."}, {"title": "Performance measurement of lattice with resonators", "content": "In figure 5, we have selected a primary honeycomb lattice structure interlaced with a single honeycomb unit (LS1) at the centre. Our objective is to study the effect of mass insertion in the central honeycombs on the bandgap characteristics of the metastructure. The metastructure is chosen as per the ease of mass insertion and enables us to observe changes in the attenuation band, which are influenced by local resonances occurring at frequencies that vary with the insertion location. Metallic hexagonal inserts are made up of structural steel (as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5), and their detailed properties and composition are shown in Supplementary table S3. Given that the lattices are fabricated through 3D printing using Polylactic Acid (PLA), and subsequently metallic inserts of much heavier density are used inside the lattice, these inserts function as local resonators due to the density difference between PLA and steel. These characteristics make the metastructure well-suited for vibration control applications. The presence of inserts significantly influences the wave transmission patterns. Furthermore, the strategic placement of the inserts are considered in such a manner that the inserts themselves make a pattern inside the lattice structure. By changing their location, we can control the bandgap for planar excitation in 1D. In Figure 5(a), we present the effect of random vibration through the simple lattice, while in Fig. 5(b) we explore the effect of wave transmission in broken symmetry of diamond pattern where the middle row of the lattice is fully filled while the top and bottom row is filled with metallic inserts with a definite pattern. In Fig. 5(c), the effect of wave transmission in the cross-shape pattern is shown where the inserts are arranged alternatively in the middle row of lattice and the top and bottom row is completely filled. In Fig. 5(d) lattices are filled in such a manner that it forms an arrow indicating towards the right direction. Figure 5(e), represents the diamond pattern where the middle row is fully filled; however, the top and bottom rows are alternatively filled. In Fig. 5(f), the top and bottom rows are fully filled and the middle row is fully empty. In Fig. 5(g), the top and bottom rows are fully filled; however, the middle row is filled such that there is a spacing of two units between the consecutive inserts. In Fig. 5(h), the top row is alternatively filled starting with a blank cell while the bottom row is also alternatively filled starting with a filled cell, and the middle row is fully filled except for the first and the last cell representing upward pointing arrow. In Fig. 5(i), the top and bottom rows are alternatively filled while the middle row is filled with two-unit spacing. Through the study of dynamic response corresponding to harmonic excitation for all these combinations, we aim to find out which pattern location is more sensitive and affects more at a specific frequency range of wave transmission. We observed that generally, the middle row exhibits higher sensitivity compared to the top and bottom rows. Additionally, by arranging different combinations of inserts, we achieved up to 48% bandgap enlargement, multiple bandgaps, and the ability to shift the bandgap across the desired frequency range. Further, the experiments corresponding to each iteration are carried out to validate our simulation results by using a Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV). Random vibration up to 10 KHz is performed using LDS shaker with the gain set as unity. Detailed experimental setup can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S10. As may be observed in Fig. 5, our experimental results show good agreement with the simulation. The printing pattern, and infill density (presented in Supplementary Table S2), also affect the attenuation band."}, {"title": "Bandgap characteristics of honeycomb based interlaced structures", "content": "Comparative analysis of the effect of different interlaced structures on bandgap shift (Fig. 6(a)) is carried out in various frequency ranges. The band gap occurs at a frequency band comparatively higher than that of the simple honeycomb structure. Notably, for the LS3 structure bifurcation in bandgap occurs, and for the last structure (LS9) multiple bandgaps occur both for the higher and lower frequency ranges. Furthermore, we have compared the bandgap range of various interlaced honeycomb unit cells (Fig. 6b) along with the force-deflection relationships. The force-deflection relationships are linear for all the patterns except for LS9.\nFigure 6(c) illustrates the fractal structure of different order (n=0,1,2) and their corresponding bandgap shifts. In different structures, as the fractal order increases, the bandgap shifts to higher frequency ranges, and for further increase in fractal order multiple bandgaps occur. Furthermore, on the right side we have represented the force-deflection relationship for the fractal structure (see Fig. 6d). With the increase in the fractal order, the structure becomes stiffer, with 196.32% increase from zeroth to first-order fractal and 33.61% increase from first to second-order fractal. From this study, we can conclude that with increasing the structural complexity inside the structure, the bandgap starts to shift towards the higher frequency range, and for higher-order fractals, it also bifurcates which is verified by taking different fractal structures inside the honeycomb and explained in the Supplementary Fig. S8."}, {"title": "AI-driven Inverse Design of Metastructures", "content": "With the phenomenal expansion potential of the geometry of metastructures, it is possible to use AI efficiently for both forward analysis in predicting the bandgaps as well as inverse design where for a given bandgap a suitable pattern may be obtained. The complete flow diagram of a possible AI-based inverse design of metastructures is depicted in Fig. 7. The entire method comprises two components: (i) the forward analysis model and (ii) the inverse design model. The forward analysis model acts as a surrogate model for training the inverse design model. It is trained independently for the forward analysis of the metastructures with known transmissibility."}, {"title": "Forward Analysis Model", "content": "The forward analysis model consists of repeated blocks of geometric feature extraction modules capable of learning complex metastructure geometry having primary, secondary, and tertiary complexity. Each geometrical feature extraction module consists of a multi-scale geometric attention mechanism having multiple heads of FEM-inspired spatial attention (FSA) blocks. The FSA is designed to learn the dependencies of adjacent connections at different scales using different kernel sizes of convolutional modules. Each FSA consists of an input convolutional layer for feature transformation followed by a spatial attention block [61, 62]. The complete block diagram of the forward analysis block, multi-scale GA module, and the FSA block are provided in the supplementary Figures S13 and S14. The forward analysis model was implemented with 12 layers of geometric feature extraction blocks and 8 heads of FSA in each block. The kernel sizes of the input convolutional layer in 8 FSA heads are selected as (1,1,1,3,3,3,5,5). This combination of kernel sizes puts more attention on the smallest structures (tertiary), than the secondary, and the primary structures. The output of the geometric features extraction module is processed by a regression head that transforms the geometric features to the transmissibility of dimension (1000, 1). The detailed block diagram and the descriptions are provided in the supplementary file: Fig. S15 and Section E.1."}, {"title": "Inverse Design Model", "content": "The inverse design model is developed to obtain the metastructure geometry using transmissibility plots for the desired bandgap. The detailed block diagram of the inverse design model is provided with the supplementary materials (Figures S16 and S17). The key contributions of the inverse design model are the conversion of transmissibility into latent space using a multi-head 1-D self-attention mechanism, followed by constructing the interlaced patterns using a multiscale residual network. The 1-D self- attention mechanism captures the sequential dependencies of the transmissibility spectrum, [63] and generates a rectified latent space of shape (3 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 256). The latent space is further extended to a new higher space using reflection padding and then non-linearly down-sampled back to the same dimension using multiple consecutive convolutional layers with ReLU activation.\nNow the transformed latent space is passed through a multiscale residual network having three parallel convolutional paths with three different kernel sizes: (1\u00d71), (3x3), and (5 \u00d7 5) as shown in Fig. S17(b). These sizes have been selected based on the institution to transform the latent space into the three levels of interlaced structural geometry. The smallest kernel is responsible for learning the tertiary structures, the medium size helps to learn the secondary structural geometry. Similarly, the largest value (5 \u00d7 5) is responsible for learning the primary geometry. The final output of the multi-scale residual network is the interlaced patterns. It is now upsampled using three layers of 2-D transposed convolution and then transformed non-linearly using 2-D convolution and tanh activation to produce the final geometry."}, {"title": "Training", "content": "For the training of the proposed AI-based inverse design of the metastructures, a dataset having 720 samples of different metastructures is prepared using different interlaced structures as shown in supple- mentary Fig. S12. In the unit cell of these structures, the primary structure is a honeycomb and the secondary structures are different combinations of honeycomb, star, circle, hierarchical honeycomb, and auxetic interlaced structure. Then the corresponding transmissibility is calculated using FEM analysis. The samples are divided into two portions: training and validation with a ratio of 90:10. The AI-based inverse design mechanism is trained in two phases.\ni) Forward Analysis Model: In the first phase, the forward analysis model is trained using the training samples to predict the transmissibility of a given metastructures. The training loop is depicted in Fig. 7(a). The comparison of the predicted transmissibility obtained by the forward analysis model and the true transmissibility obtained by the FEM analysis are compared in Fig. 8.\nii) Inverse Design Model: Once the forward analysis model is fully trained, it is used as a surrogate model for the training of the inverse design model as displayed in Fig. 7(b). The loss function (L) for the weight update of the inverse design model is constructed as provided in equation (1)\n$L = L_1 + \\beta_1 * L_2 + \\beta_2 * L_3$  (1)\nwhere, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are the penalty terms for the inclusion of losses $L_2$ and $L_3$. The values of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ were selected as 0.1 and 0.6, respectively.\n$L_1$ = MSE: mean square error between predicted transmissibility on generated metastructure and the transmissibility obtained from the FEM method on original metastructure.\n$L_2$ = SSIM: structural similarity index measure between the generated metastructure and the original metastructure [64].\n$L_3$ = MMD: maximum mean discrepancy between the generated metastructure and the original metastructure (MMD) [65].\nFurther details of these losses are provided in the supplementary material, Section F."}, {"title": "Validation of AI-model for metastructure design", "content": "The metastructure produced by the inverse design model contains colored noises due to training with a small value of batch size (small batch size was chosen due to the limited number of samples in the dataset). Therefore, a noise removal filter is applied to produce a clear image of the obtained metastructure during validation. The algorithm for the noise removal is provided in supplementary material, Section G. The AI-based inverse design of metastructures is validated under two cases:\nValidation on known metastructure as test sample:\nThe comparison of generated metastructure for one test sample from the test data (10% of available 720 samples) is provided in Fig. 8. Figures 8(a), (b) show the test metastructure and its transmissibility obtained by the FEM method which is assumed to be true (input) transmissibility for inverse design. The predicted metastructure by the inverse design model exactly matches the original metastructure with an SSIM score of 0.991 as shown in Figure 8(c). Forward analysis is performed on both the original and the predicted metastructures. The predicted transmissibilities are compared with the input (true) transmissibility in Fig. 8(d) and (e). It can be observed that MSEs for transmissibility obtained from the original metastructure and the predicted metastructure are 0.0834 and 0.1939 respectively. The MSE for predicted transmissibility by forward analysis on the predicted metastructure is comparatively larger because of the existence of noises in the predicted metastructure.\nValidation on Artificial Transmissibility:\nThe AI-based inverse design model is further validated for practical deployment to design a metastructure facilitating the formation of a desired frequency bandgap. Hence, an artificial transmissibility is created having the desired bandgap and fed to the inverse design model. The generated metastructure and the corresponding transmissibilities obtained by the forward analysis model and FEM are shown in"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "It has been found experimentally and analytically from the previous study that a simple lattice structure has the ability to block waves for a certain frequency range when it passes longitudinally throughout the lattice. Inspired from the architectural patterns, we have designed mechanical metamaterial lattices with diverse interlaced structures. A comprehensive study has been performed through simulation-based analysis using Ansys. Experiments have been conducted to validate the transmissibility property corre- sponding to different lattice configurations. This work shows the blueprint of metamaterials, including the fact that the effective properties of the lattice are contingent on collective patterns and subpatterns of the unit cells. Furthermore, the tunability of the bandgaps through design resulted in larger and mul- tiple bandgaps occurring in Frequency Response Function (FRF) plots. The reported band gap caused by the lattice structures can be further modified by adding metallic inserts with different combinations of insert patterns. These metallic inserts interact with the geometry and due to the large density differ- ence as compared to lattice material (PLA), they act as local resonators, providing flexibility to adjust bandgaps. Some significant negative peaks are obtained from the transmissibility plots that signify wave attenuation and show good agreement with the simulation results, as shown in Fig. 5. The discrepancy in some amplitude and peak are due to nonconsideration of damping in simulation. Apart from damping, printing speed, orientation, infill pattern, and infill density of 3D printing are also affected as discussed and shown in Supplementary Table S2. These findings unveil a deep connection between lattices and band gaps and have broad potential applications in the field of vibration isolation for high-speed trains and in serving as surface waveguides and absorbers.\nThe second part of this study on the inverse design of metastructure using geometric attention- based deep architecture is a benchmark in the field of inverse design of complex structure whether it is metastructure for the desired mechanical response or any other complex pattern for desired physical properties. The major challenge in the training of an AI-based inverse design model is the availability of sufficient number of training samples. The higher the complexity of the structure, the higher the number of samples required for the training. Our proposed model uses FEM to learn the dependencies of adjacent connections in the geometrical structure. Therefore, it can easily extract the information embedded in the complex structure and learn the relationship between the input geometry and the output transmissibility. Further, the multiscale geometrical attention mechanism provides the capability to learn the multiple levels of complexity. With the same concept, multiscale feature transformation using the multiscale residual network enables the inverse design model to reconstruct multiple levels of geometry, like a honeycomb and hierarchical honeycomb substructures. Therefore, the proposed framework of the geometrical attention-based feature learning and the inverse design can be useful for any other scientific design problem.\nIn summary, our paper reflects the following novelties:\n\u2022 Discovery of novel functionality in a set of ancient patterns from the mechanical metastructure perspective such as vibration transmission and attenuation.\n\u2022 Identification of two unique parameters: interlaced metastructure and fractal order in such patterns followed by their application in 3D printed 2D mechanical metastructure panels.\n\u2022 Further modifications of such metastructures by including local resonators in the form of mass inserts to improve bandgap characteristics through experimental studies.\n\u2022 Creation of novel AI-based forward analysis model using multiscale geometric attention mechanism which can predict the transmissibility as well as bandgap of a metastructure subjected to base excitation."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Experimental testing\nThe study utilizes a non-contact technique to measure vibration to assess the response of different latticed metastructures.

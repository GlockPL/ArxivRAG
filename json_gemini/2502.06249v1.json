INTRODUCTION", "content": "Since we can learn (more) about the state a quantum system is in through measurements, it's of paramount importance to understand how to make decisions based on the outcomes of these measurements. This is the central question we'll answer here: how to represent the uncertainty about a quantum system's state conditional on the outcome of a measurement?\nThis question has been addressed in the literature, most famously by L\u00fcders [15], but most of the extant an-swers are based on the arguably too narrow notion of probability in quantum mechanics. That is why we build upon the more general sets of desirable measurements framework, which goes back to Benavoli, Fac-chini, and Zaffalon [5], and which we recently explored and tried to justify in [12]. In that earlier work of ours on desirable measurements, we developed a decision-theoretic argument involving imprecise probabilities to model the uncertainty about a quantum system's state. This has led to a similar mathematical framework as that first introduced by Benavoli, Facchini, and Zaffalon [5], but with a different interpretation.\nOur argument there proceeds along the following lines. The system is in an unknown state |\u03a8) in the state space X. Hermitian operators \u00c2 represent mea-surements, which allow us to interact with the system and learn more about the system state. We associate with each such measurement operator a utility function u: X \u2192 R, which represents the reward asso-ciated with performing that measurement. If the sys-tem is in state |4), then u\u2081(|4)) is the utility associated with performing the measurement \u00c2: performing mea-surement A on the system in the unknown state |\u03a8) re-sults in an uncertain reward u\u2081(|\u03a8)). Through decision-theoretic postulates based on the non-probabilistic foun-dations of quantum mechanics, we show that this util-ity function must have the form u\u2081(|$)) = ($|\u00c2|$) for all |\u00a2\u203a \u2208 X. The uncertainty of a rational subject called You about the unknown state |\u03a8) can then be captured by expressing preferences between measure-ments, via preferences between their associated uncer-tain rewards. Such a (partial) preference ordering on measurements is therefore a model for Your uncertainty about |\u03a8). Equivalently, You can use a so-called set of desirable measurements, which are those measurements You prefer to the status quo the null measurement. Modelling uncertainty in this way follows the sets of de-sirable gambles approach that's common in imprecise probabilities research; see also [2, 10, 11, 16, 17, 20\u201322].\nHere, using the power of indifference statements, al-ready proven invaluable in our earlier work [13], we'll show how to extend this framework to deal with con-ditioning in quantum mechanics. After a concise intro-duction to the desirable measurements approach in Sec-tion 2, we have a closer look in Section 3 at how to rep-resent Your new knowledge of a measurement outcome in this framework. In Section 4, we look at an abstract representation of updating through indifference state-ments, which we then apply in Section 5 to condition-ing on measurement outcomes. We thus retrieve a con-ditioning rule similar to the one by Benavoli, Facchini, and Zaffalon [5] but with a different interpretation and broader scope. Finally, in Section 6, we show how our abstract approach allows us to extend this to condition-ing on a set of measurement outcomes, as a first step towards conditioning on positive operator valued mea-sures."}, {"title": "2.

Quantum mechanics.", "content": "The framework is based on combining ideas from decision theory with the non-probabilistic principles of quantum mechanics; for an account of the basics of quantum mechanics, see [6, 19].\nThe state (4) of a quantum system is a normalised el-ement of a complex Hilbert space X. To keep the discus-sion simple, we'll restrict ourselves to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, which can for instance be used to model the spin or (with some extra assumptions) the energy of a bounded electron. Such finite-dimensional spaces are particularly useful in quantum computing and quan-tum cryptography [19]. We'll use the Dirac notation: a ket (4) is a vector in X, and the bra (4\u2758 its adjoint.

As is com-mon in decision theory [1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 18, 22, 24], Your uncertainty will be described by Your preferences be-tween these different acts, and we attach to each such act/measurement \u00c2 a utility function u: X \u2192 R, where u (1$)) is the reward associated with performing the measurement \u00c2 when the system is in state |$), ex-pressed in units of some linear utility.\nWe have argued elsewhere [12] that a number of decision-theoretic principles, based on the non-probabilistic postulates of quantum mechanics, leave You with no choice about which utility functions u to use: they require them to take the form u\u2081(|$)) = <$|\u00c2|$> for all |4) \u2208 X.

A mathematically equivalent model for such a preference relation is a set of desirable utility functions: those uncertain rewards that You strictly prefer to the zero utility function 0, or equivalently, a set of desirable measurements DC H: those measurements that You strictly prefer to the status quo 0.1\nTypically, rationality criteria are then imposed on such a set of desirable utility functions [2, 11, 22], which can be readily translated to the desirable measurements framework.

Suppose You identify some assessment of measurements A C H that You deem desirable, then the rationality criteria allow us to find the smallest if any coherent set of desir-able measurements that includes A.

D]rng(pr) is coherent in rng(pr) by Proposition 4.3.\nHowever, as we need the entire state space, and there-fore need to work with all measurements, to deal with any possible further evolution of the quantum system, we can use the rng(pr)-focused set of desirable measure-ments | rng(pr) in H that corresponds to the coherent set rng(pr) of desirable measurements in rng(pr):\nD|rng(pr) = redpr (D] rng(pr))"}, {"title": null, "content": "= HP \u222a {\u00c2 \u2208 H : pr(\u00c2) \u2208 D}; (18)"}, {"title": null, "content": "see Proposition 4.5 for the second equality. By Propo-sition 4.4, this set is coherent in H, so we've achieved our goal: we've turned Your initial coherent set of de-sirable measurements into a new coherent and I, pr compatible set of desirable measurements D|rng(pr).\n4.3. Duality. When Your beliefs are described by a co-herent prevision P on H,\nDp := {\u00c2 \u2208 H : P(\u00c2) > 0}\nis a corresponding coherent set of desirable measure-ments on X, because P = Alp = App. Updating Dp with the indifference assessment I pr I pr leads to\nDp|rng(pr) = H\u00ba\u00ba \u222a {\u00c2 \u2208 H : P(pr(A)) > 0}.\nThe linearity of the projection pr guarantees that this updated coherent set of desirable measure-ments corresponds to the updated coherent prevision P(\u2022|rng(pr)) := A\u00f8p|rng(pr) = A\u00f8p|rng(pr) on H, with\nP(\u00c2| rng(pr)) = inf{a \u2208 R : a\u00ce \u2013 \u00c2 \u2208 D|V}\nP(pr(A))\nP(pr(\u00ce))\n=for all \u00c2 \u2208 H. (19)\n5. BACK TO CONDITIONING ON A SUBSPACE\nWe're now ready to apply these general results to the specific case we'd begun studying in Section 3, where the new information that the system's state |\u03a8) belongs to some subspace V is represented by the linear space I of indifferent measurements that's the kernel of the projection operator pry = Py\u2022Py on X, so I v = I pr.\nBefore going through the details, it's useful and inter-esting to point out that the range rng(pr) of the pro-jection pr is linearly isomorphic to the linear space H(V) of all the measurements on the subspace V it-self, through the linear isomorphism rng(pr) \u2192 H(V) mapping any \u00c2 in rng(pr) to the measurement \u0108 in H(V) uniquely determined by ($|\u0108|\u00a2\u3009 = {$|\u00c2|\u00a2\u3009 for all |4) \u2208 V. The inverse linear isomorphism H(V) \u2192 rng(pr) is given by \u0108 \u2192 Py\u0108Py, with some abuse of notation.\nAlso, if \u00c2 = pr(A) \u2265pr\u2081, \u00d4, then there's some D \u2208 I v such that \u00c2 + D \u2265 0, and this leads to the following chain of implications\n\u00c2 + D \u2265 0 \u21d2 (\u2200\\\u00a2) \u2208 V) (\u00a2\\\u00c2 + D\\\u00a2) \u2265 0\n\u21d2 (\u2200|\u00a2) \u2208 V)(\u03c6|lv(\u00c2 + D)\u00cev|\u00a2) \u2265 0\n\u21d2 (\u2200|\u00a2) \u2208 V)(\u03c6|Pv\u00c2Pv|\u03c6> \u2265 0\n\u21d2 (\u2200|\u00a2) \u2208 V)(\u00a2|\u0108|\u00a2> \u2265 0,\nimplying that the isomorphic copy \u0108 of \u00c2 is positive semidefinite, so \u0108 \u2265 0 in H (V). Since the converse im-plication holds trivially, we see that the ordering \u2265pr, on"}, {"title": null, "content": "rng(pr) is an isomorphic copy of the ordering > associ-ated with positive semidefiniteness on H(V); and sim-ilarly, the ordering >pr, on rng(pry) is an isomorphic copy of the positive definiteness ordering > on H (V).\nWe can now (re)turn to the question of how to com-bine Your initial beliefs about the system's state (\u03a8), as captured in a coherent set of desirable measurements Din H, with the new knowledge that the system's state (\u03a8) belongs to some subspace V.\nApplying the results of the previous section to this par-ticular case, taking into account the above-mentioned isomorphisms and the correspondences between order-ings, we find that since Your updated beliefs must in-corporate the indifference assessments, they must be Iv-compatible, which effectively makes sure that they can be represented by some coherent set of desirable measurements in the linear space H (V) of all measure-ments on the subspace V. Their compatibility with Your initial beliefs, which are captured in the set of desir-able measurements in H, is expressed by the fact that their extension Py\u0108Py to the original space X was ini-tially desirable. In other words, Equation (17) now turns into, with obvious notations,\nD]V = E({\u0108 \u2208 H(V) : Py\u0108\u0176y \u2208 D})\n= H >0(V) \u222a {\u0108 \u2208 H(V) : Py\u0108\u0176y \u2208 D} (20)\nas Your updated set of desirable measurements in H(V); it's coherent by an application of Proposition 4.3.\nHowever, any subsequent evolution of the quantum system will typically have to be described in the whole state space X, as its dynamics may perfectly well make its state move outside the subspace V again. Proposi-tion 4.4 now tells us, mutatis mutandis, that we may find this description in X by considering the V-focused set of desirable measurements in H given by the following appropriately transformed version of Equation (18):\nD|V = HY \u222a {\u00c2 \u2208 H : Py\u00c2\u00cey \u2208 D}, (21)\nwhere HY := {Py\u0108Pv : \u0108 \u2208 H>\u00f4(V)}. Proposition 4.4 also ensures that this set is coherent, so we've achieved our goal of turning the initial coherent set of desirable measurements Din H into a new coherent and Iv-compatible set of desirable measurements D|V.\nThis rule for conditioning closely resembles the up-dating rule introduced in [5] for conditioning, but there are important differences. First, our interpretation of a set of desirable measurements isn't contingent on a bookmaker preparing and then measuring the system in certain way. Secondly, we don't restrict ourselves to the case where the conditioning event is a pure state, but we allow for conditioning on any subspace. Finally, our rule is slightly different as we impose more general co-herence axioms than the ones used in [5], which leave room for imposing indifference assessments and there-"}, {"title": null, "content": "fore give a natural interpretation to conditioning on a subspace.\nOn the other hand", "operator": "n\u03b2\u03bd =\n\u03b2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2\u03bd\nTr(y\u03b2\u03b2\u03bd)\npr()\nTr(pr())", "X": "X\u00b3\u00d8\u00c3\u00b3", "withX3": "span({|\u22121)", "k)": "l) [k).\nYou know that the system's total spin is zero", "V": "span({|\u2212\u22121", "H": "Py\u00c2Py = 0}, with\nPy = |\u22121,1)(\u22121,1| + |0,0)(0, 0| + |1, \u22121)(1, \u22121|.\nThe indifferent measurements are those that only dif-fer from \u00f4 on V's orthogonal complement V = span({|-1, -1), |\u22121, 0)"}]}

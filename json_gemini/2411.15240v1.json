The effectiveness of actigraphy in research and clinical contexts is heavily dependent on the modeling architecture utilized. To address this, we developed the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT)\u2014the first pretrained and fully attention-based model designed specifically to handle actigraphy. PAT was pretrained on actigraphy from 29,307 participants in NHANES, enabling it to deliver state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuned across various actigraphy prediction tasks in the mental health domain, even in data-limited scenarios. For example, when trained to predict benzodiazepine usage using actigraphy from only 500 labeled participants, PAT achieved an 8.8 percentage-point AUC improvement over the best baseline. With fewer than 2 million parameters and built-in model explainability, PAT is robust yet easy to deploy in health research settings.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Movement-based actigraphy, or wearable accelerometer data, was utilized as early as the 1970s to non-intrusively and effectively measure sleep and circadian patterns, particularly in \u201cfree-living\u201d (non-laboratory) environments. As wearables became more ubiquitous, researchers began to see that actigraphy contained data beyond sleep cycle information; movement intensities throughout time could be correlated to a participant's behavioral patterns\u00b9-4. Indeed, developing a fully proportional accelerometer significantly enhanced the precision of activity monitoring across various settings, facilitating broader applications in psychopathology6,7, chronobiology, and health risk management2,10,11. Presently, the near ubiquity of accelerometers in most mobile consumer devices (e.g. watches, smartphones) has established actigraphy data as a rising modality and an important source of health information for clinical researchers12,13.\nDespite their promise, current actigraphy studies face notable limitations. Historically, actigraphy studies have predominantly relied on simple processing pipelines or traditional statistical feature-based models.12 While these methods are interpretable and effective for basic analyses, they may fail to capture the nuanced patterns and complex relationships characteristic of actigraphy data. Thus, studies require advanced methods and models that can handle the unique demands of actigraphy, such as its high-frequency sampling, granularity, and extended temporal context length. Although CNNs and RNN-based LSTMs14\u201317 have been applied to actigraphy, a significant gap remains between these approaches and the state-of-the-art architectures in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. In these fields, transformers excel at"}, {"title": null, "content": "capturing complex, long-range dependencies\u2014features crucial for time-series applications like actigraphy that require modeling interactions across hours or even days.\nHowever, adapting traditional transformers to actigraphy is challenging due to the lengthy and dense nature of the data. Transformer models often limit input tokens to the hundreds, as each additional token quadratically increases memory and computation costs. For example, one week of actigraphy data produces over 10,000 tokens with minute-level sampling, quickly overwhelming standard transformers. Our approach adapts transformers specifically for actigraphy, leveraging their self-attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies more flexibly than CNNs and LSTMs. By modifying transformers to efficiently handle long actigraphy sequences, our model overcomes common limitations of existing approaches.\nAdditionally, many current studies using wearables or actigraphy data tend to feature a limited number of participants, as it is often difficult to amass large participant pools for clinical research purposes. Paired with a limited participant size, the complexity of longitudinal actigraphy data poses a challenge for machine learning models, which can have a difficult time abstracting from such data. Therefore, foundation models pretrained on extensive datasets offer a promising alternative to training models from scratch. These pretrained models can be fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific actigraphy datasets, leveraging knowledge from broader data sources to achieve robust performance even with limited participant samples. To our knowledge, there are currently no known foundation models for wearable accelerometer time series."}, {"title": null, "content": "As such, we propose designing a simple-to-use yet robust actigraphy foundation model that can be easily deployed for health related studies. First, we construct an attention model architecture for actigraphy. Moving beyond CNNs and LSTM models, we present an Actigraphy Transformer (AT) architecture that utilizes attention mechanisms and patching techniques18 to efficiently embed lengthy actigraphy data. Second, we design a mechanism for model explainability. Using attention weights, our model can output visualizations that indicate which minutes of physical activity are most impactful in the model decision. This allows researchers to make reliable inferences about how actigraphy may relate to a health outcome within a study. Third, we pretrain the model in a BERT19 or Masked Autoencoder-like manner on actigraphy data from almost 30,000 participants to create the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT).\nUsing datasets where actigraphy is labeled with a participant's psychotropic medication usage, sleep disorders and abnormalities, or PHQ-9 score (for depression), we aim to evaluate PAT's efficacy when fine-tuned for mental health studies. We hypothesize that PAT, our explainable foundation model, can deliver state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned for various actigraphy studies, even in datasets containing small amounts of labeled actigraphy data."}, {"title": "2.

Each label has its own dataset, such that the input is the participant's actigraphy, and the output is the label (e.g., depression). For each dataset, a test set of 2,000 participants is held out, while the remaining participants are used for training. We compare against several baseline models. These include a logistic regression model trained on wavelet transform features, an LSTM, a 1D CNN, a 3D CNN, and a ConvLSTM.

This allows for easy model explainability, enabling researchers to make characterizations about actigraphy and a given label, as seen in Figure 1."}, {"title": "3. DISCUSSION", "content": "Accelerometer data from wearables contain a rich source of information for healthcare and research2,23,24. Moreover, actigraphy is becoming increasingly relevant as wearable technology becomes more ubiquitous. The easily accessible wearable data, which can be obtained retrospectively and in real-time, shows promise for representing longitudinal and naturalistic behavioral patterns13,25.\nWe note, however, that major improvements can be made to the model architectures currently used for actigraphy studies. Wearable accelerometer data is unique in its ability to provide continuous, minute-level information over long periods, making it invaluable for studying longitudinal behaviors like sleep, activity levels, and mental health outcomes. However, the complexity and longitudinal structure of actigraphy data limit feature engineering and traditional machine learning models\u00b95, as patterns can span across hours or even days, requiring models that capture both short and long term changes such as daily movement and weekly activity cycles, respectively."}, {"title": null, "content": "The preferred model used for many actigraphy studies, ConvLSTM16,17,26,27, is limited by local context, as recurrent and convolutional-based models rely on the inductive bias that data points close together are more related than those further apart. Actigraphy data is often extensive and relies on capturing long-range dependencies and this presents a challenge for the ConvLSTM architecture. To circumvent this, the ConvLSTM model expands the context window for temporal and spatial models by reshaping data into a 3D matrix of 7 days \u00d7 24 hours \u00d7 60 minutes so that the start of each day is close time-wise, and the start of each hour is close"}, {"title": null, "content": "space-wise. Even so, the ConvLSTM may miss certain associations, as researchers introduce strong inductive biases during modeling. For example, the model would struggle to relate events from a Tuesday night to a Thursday morning, as they would continue to be spatially distant. These limitations, driven by inductive biases inherent to recurrent and convolutional architectures, can lead to missed associations when modeling actigraphy data."}, {"title": null, "content": "We address these issues through our PAT model. Indeed, PAT consistently outperforms the most popular models used for actigraphy in various tasks and at various dataset sizes (Table 1 and Table 2). We develop a transformer-based model because it offers the advantages of global attention28, allowing us to extrapolate beyond the local context. For instance, in the context of predicting sleep disorders, our transformers can relate movement patterns at night to a change in behavior in the evening of the next day, or even the day after-despite the fact that these events could be separated by thousands of time steps. Additionally, attention-based models require few inductive priors in contrast to recurrent or convolutional based models; attention-based models extrapolate which minutes of actigraphy data are most related through associations found in the data alone. As such, transformers are more flexible and general, allowing for better embeddings of temporally and spatially complex actigraphy data28,29. With PAT, context is elevated to a global scale such that any set of minutes can be associated with any other set of minutes along the week, regardless of spatial or temporal distance."}, {"title": null, "content": "Another major problem in machine learning and actigraphy-based research is the limited number of participants in many clinical studies30,31; it can be difficult for models to abstract information from a limited pool of participants.

Each model iteration was able to train in under six hours on Colab Pro, making it feasible for researchers with limited resources to experiment and adapt these models to their specific datasets.

METHODS", "content": null}, {"title": "4.1 Actigraphy Transformer (AT) Architecture", "content": "We first create a transformer architecture tailored to embed lengthy actigraphy data (see Figure 2).

A transformer generally receives a 1D sequence of token embeddings as its input, which translates well to the sequential nature of actigraphy data. However, due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, it is inefficient to input a week's worth (10,080 minutes) of actigraphy data as individual tokens. Following the Vision Transformer's and PatchTST's solution to circumvent the attention's quadratic complexity in images and lengthy time series, Actigraphy Transformer (AT) breaks the sequence of actigraphy into fixed-sized non-overlapping patches. N=T/S is the number of patches, where T is the total number of time steps, and S is the number of time steps in a patch. The resultant N represents the number of tokens input into AT. Like the Vision Transformer model, the AT attention layer uses a constant vector size D throughout, and we create patch embeddings by mapping each patch to D dimensions using a trainable linear projection. Each AT Transformer block consists of a multiheaded self-attention layer, a layer normalization layer, a feed-forward network, and another layer normalization layer."}, {"title": "Positional Embeddings", "content": "Since transformer-based models are inherently permutationally invariant, we add positional embeddings for each patch.

This way, our pretrained PAT model can be fine-tuned through any labeled actigraphy dataset, including small ones. PAT can then be harnessed to create state-of-the-art models for various applications, such as predicting and characterizing depression, medication use, or sleep disorders through actigraphy data."}, {"title": "Masked Autoencoder Design", "content": "Our pretraining task is simple but effective; an encoder creates a latent representation of our input, and a decoder reconstructs the original signal from the encoder representation. We utilize an asymmetric autoencoder similar to the masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining method used for images32. In MAE, random portions of the input data are masked, and the model is trained to reconstruct the missing sections. This process encourages the model to learn meaningful patterns by focusing on context and relationships in the data rather than relying on adjacent information alone. Our encoder encodes only portions of actigraphy data, while our lightweight decoder is tasked with reconstructing an entire week's actigraphy from the encoder representation tokens and mask tokens. An advantage of our Actigraphy Transformer over conventional convolutional-based models is its ability to divide our sequential data into fixed-size, non-overlapping patches for pretraining. Using this structure, we can randomly select patches to remove or mask once given a mask ratio.

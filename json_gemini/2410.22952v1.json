To reduce the parameter scale of the adaptation matrix, a low-rank strategy is typically employed. This involves decomposing the adaptation matrix into the product of a down-projection matrix and an up-projection matrix, where the bottleneck dimensionality determines the parameter scale.

Especially in cases where the target task has limited data, high labeling costs, or poor data quality [8-10], transfer learning significantly enhances model generalization and training efficiency. By pre-training on large-scale datasets and using the obtained parameters as initialization for downstream tasks, transfer learning can effectively transfer and apply the knowledge of pre-trained models. In this process, the performance and convergence speed of downstream tasks are highly correlated with the dataset used for pre-training the model. In the field of computer vision, pre-training on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet [11] has significantly improved the performance of tasks like image classification [12-15], object detection [16, 17], and semantic segmentation [18, 19]. Moreover, self-supervised pre-training [20, 21] leverages the advantage of not requiring large amounts of labeled data, expanding the data scale and enhancing feature extraction capabilities, thereby further improving the generalization ability and robustness of pre-trained models. However, due to the substantial computational resources required to fully fine-tune the parameters of pre-trained models in downstream tasks, current research has shifted towards exploring more efficient fine-tuning methods."}, {"title": "2.2 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)", "content": "Compared to full fine-tuning, the PEFT methods [22-25, 2, 26] aim to reduce the high cost of fine-tuning by freezing the majority of parameters in the pre-trained model and introducing a small number of learnable parameters to adapt to specific downstream tasks.\n\nWith the development of large pre-trained models, various PEFT approaches have emerged. Adapter [22] inserts a bottleneck-structured adapter layer into the pre-trained model and refines the model by updating only the parameters within the adapter layer. Bias [23] focuses on the fine-tuning of models for specific downstream tasks by meticulously calibrating the bias terms. VPT [24] integrates the concept of prompt learning into visual tasks, thereby facilitating targeted optimization for specific downstream tasks. SSF [25] efficiently fine-tunes the weights in pre-trained models through affine transformations composed of scaling and shifting operations. AdaptFormer [2] explores a parallel adapter solution on ViT for various downstream tasks.

By employing reparameterization techniques, these low-rank matrices are combined with the existing parameter matrices, thereby circumventing extra inference costs. AdaLoRA [27] employs singular value decomposition to decompose weight matrices, pruning insignificant singular values to effectively reduce the number of parameters. ARC [3] uses symmetric up-down projections to create cross-layer shared bottleneck operations. By learning low-dimensional rescaling coefficients, it effectively recombines layer-adaptive adapters, reducing the costs of fine-tuning. FedPara [28] reparameterizes model layers with low-rank matrices and uses the Hadamard product. This approach, unconstrained by low-rank limitations, offers greater capacity and reduces learning costs. RLRR [29] examines mainstream PEFT methods from the perspective of SVD decomposition, exploring the critical balance between preserving generalization in pre-trained models and adapting them to downstream tasks. Our research abandons the traditional fixed-rank approach, opting instead for a more flexible adjustment of parameter matrices using a small number of learnable parameters."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "In this section, we commence with an introduction of the notations, symbols, and contextual background related to low-rank adaptations and Householder transformation.

This adaptation primarily aims to construct the Householder unitary matrices via a learnable weight vector, thereby trading-off the fully spanned representation space and the affordable parameter size."}, {"title": "3.1 Preliminary knowledge", "content": "Low-rank adaptation. Pre-trained ViT models are typically initialized with weights learned from large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet. The pre-training process involves optimizing the model on an unsupervised or supervised pretext task. The resulting pre-trained weights encode rich semantic information that can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks through fine-tuning. As one of the most representative methods of fine-tuning, PEFT method achieves excellent results on downstream tasks by merely utilizing a small number of additional learnable parameters to fine-tune the ViT. The most prevalent PEFT is the adaptation method, which can be divided into two categories: LoRA-based and adapter-based methods. In general, LoRA-based method is defined as:\n\n$$X_{FT}^{(l)} = X^{(l-1)} (W_{AFT}^{(l)} + W_{down}^{(l)} W_{up}^{(l)}) + b^{(l)}$$\n\nwhere $$X_{FT}^{(l)}$$ is the fine-tuning output, $$W_{AFT}^{(l)}$$ is any linear weight projection $$\\lbrace W_{q}^{(l)},W_{v}^{(l)},W_{k}^{(l)}, W_{o}^{(l)}, W_{FC1}^{(l)}, W_{FC2}^{(l)} \\rbrace$$ in ViT, $$b^{(l)}$$ is the bias weights, $$W_{down}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times D'}$$ and $$W_{up}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D'\\times D^{(l)}}$$ are down- and up-adapting projection matrices across varying layers with the dimensionality $$D' \\ll D^{(l)}$$.

Following this way, HTA facilitates the derivation of the adaptation matrix in a manner that is parameter-efficient, while theoretically accommodating the flexibility of varying ranks for the adaptation matrices.\n\nIn our approach, we respectively employ the Householder matrices $$H_{left}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times D^{(l)}}$$ and $$H_{right}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times D^{(l)}}$$ as substitutes for the left and right unitary matrices $$W_{left}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times D'}$$ and $$W_{right}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D' \\times D^{(l)}}$$ within the adaptation matrix $$W_{adaptation}^{(l)}$$ to form the HTA adaptation matrix $$W_{H_{lA}}^{(l)}$$:\n\n$$W_{H_{lA}}^{(l)} = H_{left}^{(l)} D^{(l)} H_{right}^{(l)}$$\n$$ = (I - \\frac{2t_{left}^{(l)} (t_{left}^{(l)})^T}{\\lVert t_{left}^{(l)} \\rVert ^2}) D^{(l)} (I - \\frac{2t_{right}^{(l)} (t_{right}^{(l)})^T}{\\lVert t_{right}^{(l)} \\rVert ^2})$$\n\nwith two learnable parameter vectors $$t_{left}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}$$ and $$t_{right}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}$$ and a learnable diagonal parameter vector $$d^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}$$ in the diagonal matrix $$D^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times D^{(l)}}$$.\n\nSince the Householder transformation matrix is derived from a single vector, its transformation capacity can be limited and sensitive to the vector learned to derive it. To enhance the robustness of the adaptation matrix, we incorporate an additional low-rank adaptation matrix, resulting in the ultimate HTA. Building on this design, we can derive the LoRA alternative as follows:\n\n$$X_{FT}^{(l)} = X^{(l-1)} (W_{AFT}^{(l)} + W_{down}^{(l)} W_{up}^{(l)} + W_{H_{lA}}^{(l)}) + b^{(l)}$$\n$$ = X^{(l-1)} (W_{AFT}^{(l)} + W_{down}^{(l)} W_{up}^{(l)} + (I - \\frac{2t_{left}^{(l)} (t_{left}^{(l)})^T}{\\lVert t_{left}^{(l)} \\rVert ^2}) D^{(l)} (I - \\frac{2t_{right}^{(l)} (t_{right}^{(l)})^T}{\\lVert t_{right}^{(l)} \\rVert ^2}))) + b^{(l)}$$\n\nwhere $$W_{down}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)} \\times 1}$$ and $$W_{up}^{(l)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times D^{(l)}}$$, unless otherwise stated.

We evaluated the effectiveness of our method using two sets of visual adaptation benchmarks: FGVC and VTAB-1k, involving a total of 24 datasets. The FGVC collection consists of five Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) datasets: CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Oxford Flowers, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. These datasets focus on distinguishing between visually similar subcategories within a broader category, making the task more challenging and detailed. The VTAB-1k benchmark comprises 19 diverse visual classification tasks, divided into three categories: Natural, which includes images captured by standard cameras; Specialized, which includes images captured by specialized equipment such as remote sensing and medical imaging devices; and Structured, which includes synthesized images from simulated environments, such as object counting and 3D depth prediction. Each VTAB-1k task includes 1,000 training samples.\n\nPre-trained backbones. We employ ViT [13] and Swin Transformer [14] as backbone architectures to evaluate our proposed approach. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed HTA model, we utilize two variants of ViT: ViT-Base and ViT-Large. These models are pre-trained on the ImageNet21K dataset [11]. Additionally, to ensure a fair comparison, we follow the settings from previous work [29] and conduct separate experiments using a ViT backbone enhanced with AugReg [34].\n\nBaselines and existing PEFT methods. In our comparative analysis, we evaluate the performance of our HTA against two baselines and several state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Unless otherwise specified, our HTA follows the design in Eq. (6), with the dimension of the low-rank adaptation matrix set to 1. The two baselines we consider are: (1) Full Fine-tuning: This baseline involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained model using the training data of the downstream task. (2) Linear Probing: This baseline focuses on learning a linear classification head on the downstream task while keeping the remaining parameters of the pre-trained model frozen. In addition to the baselines, we compare our method with the following state-of-the-art solutions: Adapter [22], Bias [23], LORA [1], VPT [24], AdaptFormer [2], FacT [26], ARC [3] and RLRR [29]."}, {"title": "4.2 Experimental comparisons", "content": "In this section, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of our method with other state-of-the-art approaches using different benchmarks and backbones.

We conducted a comparison of our method with other PEFT methods and baselines using two different benchmarks: FGVC and VTAB-1k. The results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. On the VTAB-1k dataset, our method not only demonstrates strong competitiveness compared to the baselines but also shows advantages over current state-of-the-art methods. On many of the datasets, our method achieves the best performance with a reasonable parameter count. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, RLRR [29], our method achieves superior overall performance while reducing the number of parameters by one-third. When using the AugReg-enhanced model, our lead is further amplified. In Table 2, we further compare our method with others on the FGVC benchmark. While our method also achieves appealing performance on this dataset, the advantage is less evident. This is due to the fact that very high performance has already been achieved on this dataset, and the performance improvements have nearly saturated."}, {"title": "Experiments on larger-scale ViT backbone", "content": "In addition to using the ViT-B backbone, we also employed the ViT-L backbone, which has a deeper block structure, to validate the scalability and generalizability of our method.

The Swin Transformer is renowned for its hierarchical design, consisting of multiple stages, each with transformer blocks that maintain consistent feature dimensions unique to that stage. As shown in Table 4, our method notably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, with an overall improvement of 1.2% over the previous best performance while using only half of the parameters."}, {"title": "4.3 Ablation studies", "content": "To gain deeper insights into the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive ablation studies to elucidate its critical features and carry out pertinent analyses.\n\nUsing HTA as alternative to low-rank based adaptation matrix. As mentioned earlier, our proposed HTA model offers a more flexible adaptation capacity compared to other low-rank based adaptation matrices. To validate this claim, we replaced the adaptation matrices of LoRA [1] and Adaptor [22] with HTA. Initially, following FacT [26], LORA [1] was originally applied to the {Wq, Wv} projection matrices in the multi-head attention operation of each ViT layer, while Adapter was applied to the feed-forward neural network components layer-wise, as described in Eq. (2). For a fair comparison, we also applied HTA separately to $$\\lbrace W_{q}^{(l)},W_{v}^{(l)} \\rbrace$$ and $$\\lbrace W_{FC1}^{(l)}, W_{FC2}^{(l)} \\rbrace$$. From the results in Table 5, we observe that our method slightly outperforms LORA but with significantly fewer parameters. Moreover, our method achieves significant improvement over Adapter still using much fewer parameters. These results indicate that our method achieves a better trade-off between adaptation performance and parameter efficiency. To further test the effectiveness of our method when using a similar parameter scale to LoRA, we additionally applied HTA to FFN layers. The results show that under the same parameter size, our method exhibits a noticeable improvement over LORA.\n\nAblation study on the bottleneck dimensionality of additive adaptation matrix in HTA. We conducted ablation experiments to verify the effect of incorporating low-rank adaptation matrices in HTA, as well as the impact of its bottleneck dimensionality. The results are presented in Fig. 2. From these results, we observe that without the addition of low-rank adaptation, HTA experiences an obvious performance drop. This is due to the fact that while deriving orthogonal matrices using Householder transformations is parameter-efficient, their inherent dependence on a single chosen vector makes them insufficient as a set of general orthogonal bases for representing arbitrary high-dimensional space. When using a low-rank adaptation matrix with rank 1, HTA shows a significant performance boost. This indicates that even with a simple low-rank adaptation, HTA can achieve a promising trade-off between adaptation performance and parameter efficiency. By incorporating these low-rank matrices, HTA can maintain high performance while being parameter-efficient."}, {"title": "5 Limitations", "content": "In this work, we use Householder transformations to construct adaptation matrices in a parameter-efficient manner. Although Householder transformation matrices are orthogonal, they cannot serve as general orthogonal bases in high-dimensional spaces due to their inherent dependence on a single vector. This limitation may reduce the adaptation capacity of the adaptation matrix composed of two Householder matrices. We address this issue by incorporating a rank-1 adaptation matrix, which may somewhat detract from the elegance of the proposed method. However, it is worth exploring strategies to eliminate the need for the additive adaptation matrix, thereby further enhancing the elegance and efficiency of the HTA method."}, {"title": "6 Conclusions", "content": "In this work, we proposed a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) solution. Our method addresses the limitation of fixed bottleneck dimensionality in low-rank based adaptation matrices, which can restrict adaptation flexibility. By viewing the adaptation matrix from the perspective of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we use Householder transformations to mimic orthogonal bases. These transformations, derived from a single vector, are highly parameter-efficient. We adaptively learn diagonal coefficients to flexibly combine two Householder matrices into an adaptation matrix, accommodating layer-wise variations. Theoretically, our method can generate adaptation matrices with varying ranks while maintaining a reasonable parameter size, offering a potential alternative to low-rank based adaptations. Experiments on two sets of downstream vision classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}]}

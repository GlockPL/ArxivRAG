Alt text plays a critical role in enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content through assistive technologies.

This paper introduces AltGen, a novel AI-driven pipeline designed to automate the generation of alt text for images in EPUB files. By integrating state-of-the-art generative models, including advanced transformer-based architectures, AltGen achieves contextually relevant and linguistically coherent alt text descriptions. The pipeline encompasses multiple stages, starting with data preprocessing to extract and prepare relevant content, followed by visual analysis using computer vision models such as CLIP and ViT. The extracted visual features are enriched with contextual information from surrounding text, enabling the fine-tuned language models to generate descriptive and accurate alt text. Validation of the generated output employs both quantitative metrics, such as cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative feedback from visually impaired users. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of AltGen across diverse datasets, achieving a 97.5% reduction in accessibility errors and high scores in similarity and linguistic fidelity metrics.

Among various digital formats, EPUB files [8, 16] have emerged as a widely adopted standard due to their adaptability and compatibility with assistive technologies. These features position EPUB files as a cornerstone of digital content accessibility. However, despite these advantages, a significant proportion of EPUB files fall short of meeting accessibility standards, particularly in providing alternative text (alt text) [7, 11] for images. Alt text is a foundational element of digital accessibility, serving as a textual substitute for images that enable visually impaired users to comprehend visual content through screen readers. The absence or inadequacy of alt text severely undermines the usability and inclusivity of digital documents.\nManually generating high-quality alt text [4, 13, 14, 22] for large collections of EPUB files presents a significant challenge. The process requires domain expertise, contextual understanding, and considerable time, making it infeasible for organizations managing vast digital libraries. This bottleneck is particularly critical for compliance with accessibility regulations such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [3], which mandate the inclusion of descriptive alt text. The complexity of ensuring accessibility at scale underscores the need for innovative, automated solutions.\nRecent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Modern AI models, particularly those based on transformer architecture [12, 17, 25], have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks involving natural language processing and computer vision. These models excel at understanding and generating text while analyzing and interpreting visual content. This paper introduces the AltGen pipeline, a novel AI-driven framework that leverages these advancements to automate the generation of alt text for images in EPUB files. By integrating advanced generative models, AltGen transforms how accessibility is approached, offering a scalable, efficient, and high-quality solution to the alt text generation problem.\nThe AltGen pipeline comprises several key stages. The process begins with data preprocessing, where EPUB files are parsed to extract images, textual content, and metadata. Advanced computer vision models, such as CLIP [21] or ViT [6], are then employed to analyze visual content and extract meaningful features. These visual features are contextualized using surrounding text from the EPUB file to ensure the generated descriptions are both descriptive and relevant. Transformer-based generative models, such as GPT [1], are fine-tuned on paired image-text datasets to synthesize alt text that is both linguistically coherent and contextually accurate. The final output undergoes validation through a combination of quantitative metrics, such as cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative user feedback from visually impaired participants.\nThe contributions of this work are multifaceted. First, it establishes a comprehensive framework for AI-driven alt text generation tailored specifically for EPUB files, addressing a critical gap in digital accessibility. Second, the pipeline is rigorously evaluated on a diverse dataset of EPUB files, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods. Quantitative results highlight the accuracy and linguistic fidelity of the generated alt text, while qualitative studies underline the practical usability and impact of the AltGen pipeline on end-users. Third, this work introduces a novel integration of computer vision and natural language processing techniques, setting a new benchmark for accessibility enhancements in digital content."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Challenges of EPUB Accessibility in Compliance with WCAG Guidelines", "content": "Adopting WCAG standards for digital accessibility remains inconsistent, particularly for EPUB files. Studies show that many government websites fail to meet even basic WCAG-conformance levels, highlighting broader challenges in accessibility compliance [20]. While publishers increasingly recognize the importance of accessibility, achieving full compliance with WCAG 2.0 and newer guidelines remains a significant challenge [5]. Similar challenges exist for W3C-maintained HTML standards, which also face limited adoption [26]."}, {"title": "2.2 Al-Driven Alt Text Generation for EPUB Images", "content": "The automatic generation of alt text for images in EPUB files has emerged as a critical area for improving accessibility. Generative AI has shown transformative potential by enabling the creation of contextually relevant and high-quality descriptions for diverse image types [13-15, 22]. Recent advancements in AI-powered services, such as AltText AI, leverage large-scale datasets to train sophisticated models that produce accurate and context-sensitive alt text [27]. Additionally, ongoing research efforts focus on optimizing the efficiency of AI systems [2, 10, 23, 24], ensuring that these technologies can operate at scale and with reduced computational overhead. Such advancements are crucial for enabling the widespread adoption of AI-driven solutions in accessibility-focused applications. The effectiveness of these models has been validated through user-centric evaluations, where participants rate the relevance and accuracy of generated alt text on a 5-point scale. This feedback methodology aligns with established practices in evaluating AI-generated content, as highlighted in previous studies [9, 18]. These evaluations not only measure technical accuracy but also assess the practical impact on end-user accessibility.

The similarity is evaluated using the cosine similarity metric:\nCosine Similarity(A, B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A||||B||},\nwhere $A \\cdot B$ denotes the dot product of the vectors, and $||A||$ and $||B||$ are the magnitudes of the respective vectors. Higher cosine similarity scores indicate greater alignment with the expected descriptions, validating the effectiveness of the alt text generation process.\nAdditionally, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores are calculated to measure the linguistic fidelity of the generated alt text against human-written descriptions. Let C represent the candidate alt text and R the reference alt text. BLEU is computed as:\nBLEU = BP \\cdot exp\\bigg( \\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\log p_n\\bigg),\nwhere BP is the brevity penalty, $p_n$ is the precision for n-grams, and $w_n$ are the weights."}, {"title": "3.5.2 User Feedback", "content": "Qualitative evaluation is conducted through user studies involving visually impaired participants.

These methods leverage the low-rank structure of gradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix found by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these algorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to optimizers that can be analyzed with Hamilto-nian Descent, including most common ones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose Online Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without SVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online Subspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace Descent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show that for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters on the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better downstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods across different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The continual advancement in training large language models (LLMs) presents a compelling challenge in balancing computational efficiency with model performance. As the scope and complexity of these models grow, so does the necessity for innovative strategies that optimize memory usage without compromising the learning capabilities of the model. Recent approaches in low-rank adaptation strategies, including Stochastic Subspace Descent [13], LoRA [11], ReLoRA [15], Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore) [25] and Sketchy [9], have paved the way for memory-efficient training by utilizing a periodically updated low-rank projection matrix to manage parameter updates. In particular, GaLore and Sketchy both utilize expensive singular value decomposition to determine the projection matrix, whereas stochastic subspace descent suggests using random matrices as projection matrices and provides convergence analysis on convex functions and objectives. However, to the best of our knowledge, no one has offered any guarantee of convergence for this class of methods on non-convex functions and objectives.\nIn this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of the projection matrix. This guarantee is significant because it is broadly applicable to a wide range of optimizers that can be analyzed within the Hamiltonian descent framework [18]. By establishing this convergence guarantee, we demonstrate that our approach is not limited to specific or narrowly defined update rules, but can be extended to include many commonly used optimizers in the field.

Although low rank assumption is proved to be useful for fine-tuning with LoRA-like methods [11], it is often too limited for pre-training or when the desirable model weights are not inherently low-rank.\nTo address this problem, Zhao et al. [25] suggested to keep the projected updated in (4), but use different $P$ across the iterations:\n$W_{t+1} = W_t + P_t\u03c6_t(\\widehat{S}_t)$, $\\widehat{S}_t = \u03c8_t(\\widehat{S}_{t\u22121}, P^\\top_t \u2207L(W_t))$, $P_{t+1} = X_t(P_t, W_t, \\widehat{S}_t)$,\nwhere $X_t$ is a update rule of $P_t$ that will be determined in the sequel. The intuition is to open up different projection directions at different iterations, so that optimization can be conducted in different subspaces across different iterations. This is similar to the update of coordinate descent, except in a continuous fashion. Note that the update of $P_t$ can be done in parallel with that of $(W_t, \\widehat{S}_t)$, and incurs no slowdown once it is fast enough to not cause a speed bottleneck.\nExample 3.1.

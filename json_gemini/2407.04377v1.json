{"title": "A systematic review on expert systems for improving energy\nefficiency in the manufacturing industry", "authors": ["Borys Ioshchikhes", "Michael Frank", "Matthias Weigold"], "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the European Union's commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, efforts to improve energy\nefficiency are being intensified. The manufacturing industry is a key focal point of these endeavors due to its high final electrical\nenergy demand, while simultaneously facing a growing shortage of skilled workers crucial for meeting established goals. Expert\nsystems (ESs) offer the chance to overcome this challenge by automatically identifying potential energy efficiency improvements\nand thereby playing a significant role in reducing electricity consumption. This paper systematically reviews state-of-the-art\napproaches of ESs aimed at improving energy efficiency in industry, with a focus on manufacturing. The literature search yields\n1692 results, of which 54 articles published between 1987 and 2023 are analyzed in depth. These publications are classified\naccording to the system boundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and industry.\nFurthermore, we examine the structure, implementation, utilization, and development of ESs in this context. Through this analysis,\nthe review reveals research gaps, pointing toward promising topics for future research.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Climate change is one of the most imperative topics of modern times. The European Climate Law addresses this\nthreat by setting a net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least -55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels\n(Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, 2021). Energy use plays a critical role in the pursuit of this objective, as it was the source\nof almost three-quarters of global emissions in 2016. The industry sector is responsible for about 30% of emissions,\nwith energy use accounting for 24.2%, making it the main source of emissions. (Ritchie et al., 2020) To achieve\ndecarbonization, efforts are being made to increase the share of electricity in all sectors, and its share of final energy\nconsumption is projected to rise from 20% today to over 50% by 2050. Since the industry sector was already the\nlargest consumer of final electric energy in 2019, representing 41.9%, there is an imperative urgency to take action\n(International Energy Agency [IEA], 2021).\nIn response to this challenge, companies are prioritizing energy efficiency improvements as a way to\nsimultaneously achieve affordability, supply security, and climate goals (ABB Ltd, 2022). Energy efficiency is a\nmeasure that quantifies the utilization of energy in relation to the output or yield of services, goods, commodities, or\nenergy (Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung e.V., 2018). Increasing energy efficiency therefore means making better use\nof existing resources. According to a 2022 global survey conducted among over 2,200 industrial companies in 13\ncountries, 97% of the companies had either already invested or were planning to invest in energy efficiency. Moreover,\n89% of these companies anticipated increasing their energy efficiency investments over the next five years, while\n52% had the ambitious goal of achieving net zero within the same timeframe (ABB Ltd, 2022). However, despite the\nincrease in energy efficiency in the manufacturing sector in recent years, there is still considerable potential for further\nimprovement (IEA, 2022). Especially energy submetering of individual industrial processes is low, showing a\ndeficiency of monitoring and targeting systems that are crucial for effective energy management and energy efficiency\nefforts. The survey also found that a lack of specialized contractors, a lack of digital skills in the workforce, and\nuncertainty about how to improve energy efficiency are significant barriers to investing in energy efficiency\nimprovements (ABB Ltd, 2022).\nThe conclusion of a study undertaken by the International Energy Agency suggests that this situation could be\nimproved with digitalization (IEA, 2017). Expert systems (ESs) are one type of advanced computer technology that\nhave emerged from research in the field of artificial intelligence and are designed specifically to assist in decision-\nmaking (DeTore, 1989). They pose a chance to overcome the mentioned barriers by combining expert knowledge and\nanalyzing energy data to automatically identify energy efficiency potentials (Ioshchikhes et al., 2023). In general, ESs\nalso referred to as knowledge-based systems or inference-based programs can be described as computer programs\nthat leverage expertise to solve problems and provide advice (DeTore, 1989). Unlike conventional applications, these\nsystems emulate human reasoning by representing human knowledge and employ heuristic or approximate methods\nto solve problems (Jackson, 1998). The intelligent activity that characterizes ESs is the use of knowledge for their\nprocessing and not just information. Information exists by itself without a context, whereas knowledge has the added\ndimension that something is done to process the information. (DeTore, 1989) Energy data from a machine would be\ninformation. Reading measurement data, determining which energy efficiency potentials are present, and drawing\nconclusions on how to exploit existing energy efficiency potentials is the use of knowledge about energy data. This\nknowledge must be provided by human experts to develop the ES.\nThere are several literature reviews covering ESs in general and ESs or artificial intelligence to optimize industrial\nproduction. Liao (2005) presents an overview of the development of ESs based on a literature review and a\nclassification of articles from 1995 to 2004 into eleven methods. The respective applications of ESs for the associated\nmethods are also given. This publication thus provides a good overview of the various applications and techniques of\nESs. However, Liao (2005) does not address the use of ESs to increase energy efficiency and does not analyze any\npublications in this area. Biel and Glock (2016) examine literature from 1983 to 2015 dealing with decision support\nmodels for energy-efficient production planning. For this purpose, procedures for production systems, energy price\nlaws, and energy efficiency criteria are considered. Although this literature analysis focuses on improving energy\nefficiency in production, it does not include ESs to achieve this objective. Similar to Liao (2005), Wagner (2017)\nprovides a broad overview of ESs and their applications from 1984 to 2016. In comparison to Liao (2005), Wagner\n(2017) introduces an indicator to estimate and compare the success of ES applications. Among many other applications\nof ESs, this publication also deals with those in production. Nevertheless, applications for increasing energy efficiency\nare not discussed. Kumar (2019) focuses his literature review on applications of ESs in production planning regarding\nthe handling of different products, process planning, tool selection, welding, and product development between 1981\nand 2016, but without considering energy efficiency.\nUnlike the previously cited reviews, this work focuses on ESs to overcome environmental and economic challenges\nby improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. Other industrial sectors are also considered to ensure that the scope\nof the study is not overly restricted and to allow possible conclusions to be drawn about manufacturing. This is done\nthrough a systematic literature review (SLR) to give a comprehensive overview of the existing research. Starting from\na total of 1692 publications, the 54 most relevant publications are extracted and categorized according to system\nboundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and industry.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodological approach of the SLR,\nwhich is then applied in section 3. This involves all steps, from focusing the topic to identifying research gaps. Finally,\nsection 4 draws a conclusion and presents proposals for future research."}, {"title": "2. Review methodology", "content": "To identify relevant publications on ESs for improving energy efficiency in manufacturing, a SLR is conducted. A\nSLR is a formal approach that aims to reduce bias due to an overly restrictive selection of the available literature and\nto increase the reliability of the literature selected (Tranfield et al., 2003). Moreover, a SLR can clarify the state of\nresearch on a topic and highlight gaps and areas requiring further research (Feak & Swales, 2009). The SLR in this\npaper follows the approach of Reynolds et al. (2003) as well as Glock and Hochrein (2011), which is complemented\nwith elements of Tranfield et al. (2003) and consists of seven consecutive steps. First, the topic is\nfocused and conceptualized. When focusing the topic (I), categories and their definitions are formulated, as consistent\nclassifications help to ensure reliability when conducting content analyses. In the conceptualization (II), research\nquestions for the review itself as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria are formulated. Moreover, the keywords and\nthe search query string are defined. Subsequently, databases suitable for the topic area are selected and searched (III).\nFor this purpose, databases of previous literature analyses covering the same topic area or suggestions of university\nlibraries for databases of individual research fields can be examined. For the literature search, we only consider\nmetadata (title, abstract, keywords). Thereby we avoid publications which contain the search terms only in the\nbibliography. After merging hits from different databases, the literature is filtered (IV) by applying the defined\ninclusion and exclusion criteria. In the next step, the full texts of the remaining publications are thoroughly analyzed\n(V). This involves extracting and summarizing relevant information from the publications. By performing backward\nand forward snowballing additional relevant publications are identified. Backward snowballing means using the\nreference list of selected literature to identify new publications to include. Forward snowballing, on the other hand, is\ncarried out to find publications that cite the selected publication. The added publications pass through steps (III) to (V)\nagain. During the synthesis (VI) of the literature essential characteristics are categorized. Finally, the findings are\nsummarized, conclusions are derived with regard to the research questions, and research gaps are identified (VII)."}, {"title": "3.

Expert system type", "content": "ESs include a user interface, a knowledge base, and an inference engine. The interactions between humans and ESs\nhappen via the user interface, e.g. to define a problem (input) or to read out the results (output). The knowledge base\nis the programmed knowledge of the expert and contains all pertinent facts and relationships as well as the rules or\nheuristics to solve problems. The inference engine is the \"intelligent\" part of an ES which can apply the knowledge\nfrom the knowledge base to solve the problem. (DeTore, 1989)\nThe way in which knowledge is represented within the knowledge base and how it is processed within the inference\nengine differs depending on the ES type. The typification of ESs in this paper is based on the categories in Liao (2005).\n\u2022 Rule-based expert system: A rule-based ES represents information in the form of IF-THEN rules. These\nrules are applied to perform operations on data in order to reach a conclusion (Liao, 2005).\n\u2022 Fuzzy expert system: Fuzzy ESs are characterized by dealing with uncertainties using fuzzy logic. While\nrule-based ESs only allow conditions or conclusions that are either true or false, fuzzy ESs allow also\nconditions or conclusions that are partly true or false. This approach is based on the premise that human\nexperts often decide without precisely quantified information (Liao, 2005).\n\u2022 Machine-learning-based expert system: This type of ES uses machine leaning (ML) as its \"intelligent\"\ncomponent to solve problems. Like ESs, ML belongs to the domain of artificial intelligence and\ncombines a collection of data-driven algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly\nprogrammed. ML also includes deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Structure and implementations of ESs", "content": "RQ3 addresses the structure and implementation of ESs. All ESs described within the analyzed 54 publications\nfeature a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface, which are interconnected. Some\nof the publications, for instance, Buccieri et al. (2020) as well as Grigoras and Neagu (2020), additionally include\ndistinct knowledge acquisition and explanation modules.\nThe expertise stored in the knowledge base can be represented in various forms. These include mathematical\nformulas (Keviczky et al., 1987), historical measurement data (Miyayama et al., 1991) physical and technical\nrelationships (Tuma et al., 1996), rules (Lin et al., 2008), and facts (Do et al., 2014). Furthermore, as outlined by\nBuccieri et al. (2020), the knowledge base can be divided into short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory\nstores information for particular use cases for which ESs are applied. Whereas the long-term memory stores more\ngeneral relationships, which correspond to the heuristic knowledge of human experts. Knowledge can be acquired\nusing different techniques. Literature surveys are explicitly mentioned by Do et al. (2014) and Perera et al. (2023) as\nwell as expert consultations by Do et al. (2014), Buccieri et al. (2020), and Perera et al. (2023). The optional knowledge\nacquisition module enables the knowledge base to be enriched with new content while the ES is already deployed.\nDepending on the ES type (Table 6), it varies how the knowledge is represented in the knowledge base and how the\ninference engine utilizes the knowledge stored in the knowledge base to gain insights or solve problems.\nThe communication between humans and the ES (human-machine interface) can be realized by different means,\nincluding interactive questionnaires (Keviczky et al., 1987), dialog boxes (Dunning et al., 1999), measurement data\ninputs (Ioshchikhes et al., 2023), text outputs and graphics (Ochoa & Capeluto, 2015). The optional explanation\nmodule clarifies the reasoning process in order to make it comprehensible and thus promote acceptance of the findings\npresented by the ES (Buccieri et al., 2020).\nAs the analyzed publications reveal, the software implementation of ES can be highly diverse. Keviczky et al.\n(1987) use Fortran and Assembler as programming languages. More recent publications implement their ESs in Excel\n(Do et al., 2014), C language (Iqbal et al., 2015), CLIPS (Buccieri et al., 2020), Python (Petruschke et al., 2021), and\nLabVIEW (Jinling Wang et al., 2023). Deng et al. (2018), Ioshchikhes et al. (2022), and Li et al. (2022) use\ncombinations of different programming languages to integrate simulation models or databases as part of the ESs."}, {"title": "3.5.4. Development of ESs for industrial applications", "content": "Many analyzed publications follow similar sequential and sometimes iterative steps in the development of their\nES.

Experimental data generation is more common in the\nanalyzed publications.\n\u2022 Data cleaning and preprocessing: Data filtering (Monedero et al., 2012), scaling (Debnath et al., 2019)\nand further preprocessing such as discriminant analysis (Monedero et al., 2012) or feature extraction\n(Jinling Wang et al., 2023) is performed.\n\u2022 Creation of a knowledge base and knowledge representation: Knowledge is gathered and represented as\ndescribed in section 3.5.3.\n\u2022 Modeling: Build mathematical models (Li et al., 2022), fuzzy models, or data-driven models such as\nneural networks (Tuma et al., 1996). The development steps of the modeling process depend on the\nrespective model type.\n\u2022 Application and validation: The ES can be qualitatively validated via user interviews and quantitatively\nthrough case studies (Li et al., 2022).\nBuccieri et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2022) specify corresponding development methods. Buccieri et al. (2020) follow\nan incremental development model exclusively for the computational implementation, without providing a detailed\ndescription of the individual phases. Li et al. (2022) base the entire development of their ES on a design science\nmethod. The method described by Li et al. (2022) comprises three phases: conceptual design phase, tool development\nphase, as well as application and validation phase. During the conceptual design, influential factors are selected,\ncalculation rules are defined, and iteratively refined. Subsequently, the computational implementation follows during\nthe tool development. Finally, the ES is validated both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nTo summarize, various development approaches for ESs can be found with some similarities in the context of\nimproving industrial energy efficiency. Most development approaches, except for those described by Buccieri et al.\n(2020) and Li et al. (2022), cannot be associated with a superior methodological approach. In the area of\nmanufacturing, no established process model with a detailed description of the individual steps for developing ESs to\nincrease energy efficiency could be found."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents a SLR that identifies, summarizes, and analyzes ESs to improve energy efficiency in industry\nwith a focus on manufacturing. The research follows a formal approach consisting of seven consecutive steps, aiming\nto reduce bias and increase the reliability of the literature selected. This led to 54 publications that were analyzed in\ndepth. To organize the findings, the proposed ESs were classified according to system boundary, manufacturing type,\napplication perspective, application purpose, and ES type. Subsequently, the raised research questions were answered,\nand research gaps were identified.\nRegarding existing literature concerning ESs, the main contribution of this work lies in the special focus on\nimproving energy efficiency in manufacturing. Other industries were also considered to allow a full assessment of\nmanufacturing. We classified this topic into different classes, dimensions, and industries. Furthermore, we examined\nthe structure, implementation, utilization, and development of ESs in this context.\nWithin the scope of this study, there are some limitations in terms of covering the state of the art in the investigated\nresearch area. The exclusive reliance on digital sources and the deliberate overlook of older publications potentially\ncauses a bias toward recent findings. Another limitation results from the language restriction, although only one of\nthe 54 publications analyzed was not written in English.\nNonetheless, this study provides a comprehensive review of the topic area covered. The analysis of the selected\npublications led to several observations that can be highlighted and discussed. While  illustrates a rise in the\nnumber of publications, it offers no insight into whether the observed trend results from an increased interest in the\ntopic or a consequence of the broader expansion of research and scientific output. However, the comparison between\nthe two relevant groups shows a greater growth in the number of publications in group A over the last ten years. This\nmight be a consequence of the increasing attention being paid to sustainability in manufacturing. The authors' country\naffiliation in Fig. 6 can also be interpreted against the background of various factors. Countries with large populations,\na strongly established secondary economic sector, and high spending on research have yielded more publications in\nthe researched area than others. Moreover, the answer given to RQ1 combined with the categorization by\nmanufacturing type suggests that ESs for improving energy efficiency are of particular interest to companies\nwith high energy consumption and large output quantities. This could be related to the initial development effort\narising from the lack of established process models (RQ4) and the low transferability of ESs to other use cases (RQ2).\nThe answers provided to the research questions revealed research gaps that can be addressed in future research.\nThus, the question arises as to why ESs are used more frequently in certain industries (RQ1) than in others and what\nreasons, such as energy consumption, output quantities, or digitalization, play a decisive role in this. Furthermore, it\nbecame apparent that in most cases ESs are not transferable to other machines, systems, or processes (RQ2). While\nadvantageous for increasing energy efficiency and preserving knowledge, it also means a high initial development\neffort for each individual use case, which can pose a barrier to implementation. Exploring the transferability aspect in\nthe development of ESs could be a subject of future research. Regarding the structure and implementation of ESs\n(RQ3), it has been revealed that although all described ESs have a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user\ninterface, their implementation is highly diverse. Accordingly, it was also pointed out that there is still no established\nmethod for the development of ESs to"}]}

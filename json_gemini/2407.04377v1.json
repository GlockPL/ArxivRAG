{"title": "A systematic review on expert systems for improving energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry", "authors": ["Borys Ioshchikhes", "Michael Frank", "Matthias Weigold"], "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the European Union's commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, efforts to improve energy efficiency are being intensified. The manufacturing industry is a key focal point of these endeavors due to its high final electrical energy demand, while simultaneously facing a growing shortage of skilled workers crucial for meeting established goals. Expert systems (ESs) offer the chance to overcome this challenge by automatically identifying potential energy efficiency improvements and thereby playing a significant role in reducing electricity consumption. This paper systematically reviews state-of-the-art approaches of ESs aimed at improving energy efficiency in industry, with a focus on manufacturing. The literature search yields 1692 results, of which 54 articles published between 1987 and 2023 are analyzed in depth. These publications are classified according to the system boundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and industry. Furthermore, we examine the structure, implementation, utilization, and development of ESs in this context. Through this analysis, the review reveals research gaps, pointing toward promising topics for future research.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Climate change is one of the most imperative topics of modern times. The European Climate Law addresses this threat by setting a net greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least -55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels (Regulation (EU) 2021/1119, 2021). Energy use plays a critical role in the pursuit of this objective, as it was the source of almost three-quarters of global emissions in 2016. The industry sector is responsible for about 30% of emissions, with energy use accounting for 24.2%, making it the main source of emissions. (Ritchie et al., 2020) To achieve decarbonization, efforts are being made to increase the share of electricity in all sectors, and its share of final energy consumption is projected to rise from 20% today to over 50% by 2050. Since the industry sector was already the largest consumer of final electric energy in 2019, representing 41.9%, there is an imperative urgency to take action (International Energy Agency [IEA], 2021).\nIn response to this challenge, companies are prioritizing energy efficiency improvements as a way to simultaneously achieve affordability, supply security, and climate goals (ABB Ltd, 2022). Energy efficiency is a measure that quantifies the utilization of energy in relation to the output or yield of services, goods, commodities, or energy (Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung e.V., 2018). Increasing energy efficiency therefore means making better use of existing resources. According to a 2022 global survey conducted among over 2,200 industrial companies in 13 countries, 97% of the companies had either already invested or were planning to invest in energy efficiency. Moreover, 89% of these companies anticipated increasing their energy efficiency investments over the next five years, while 52% had the ambitious goal of achieving net zero within the same timeframe (ABB Ltd, 2022). However, despite the increase in energy efficiency in the manufacturing sector in recent years, there is still considerable potential for further improvement (IEA, 2022). Especially energy submetering of individual industrial processes is low, showing a deficiency of monitoring and targeting systems that are crucial for effective energy management and energy efficiency efforts. The survey also found that a lack of specialized contractors, a lack of digital skills in the workforce, and uncertainty about how to improve energy efficiency are significant barriers to investing in energy efficiency improvements (ABB Ltd, 2022).\nThe conclusion of a study undertaken by the International Energy Agency suggests that this situation could be improved with digitalization (IEA, 2017). Expert systems (ESs) are one type of advanced computer technology that have emerged from research in the field of artificial intelligence and are designed specifically to assist in decision- making (DeTore, 1989). They pose a chance to overcome the mentioned barriers by combining expert knowledge and analyzing energy data to automatically identify energy efficiency potentials (Ioshchikhes et al., 2023). In general, ESs also referred to as knowledge-based systems or inference-based programs can be described as computer programs that leverage expertise to solve problems and provide advice (DeTore, 1989). Unlike conventional applications, these systems emulate human reasoning by representing human knowledge and employ heuristic or approximate methods to solve problems (Jackson, 1998). The intelligent activity that characterizes ESs is the use of knowledge for their processing and not just information. Information exists by itself without a context, whereas knowledge has the added dimension that something is done to process the information. (DeTore, 1989) Energy data from a machine would be information. Reading measurement data, determining which energy efficiency potentials are present, and drawing conclusions on how to exploit existing energy efficiency potentials is the use of knowledge about energy data. This knowledge must be provided by human experts to develop the ES.\nThere are several literature reviews covering ESs in general and ESs or artificial intelligence to optimize industrial production. Liao (2005) presents an overview of the development of ESs based on a literature review and a classification of articles from 1995 to 2004 into eleven methods. The respective applications of ESs for the associated methods are also given. This publication thus provides a good overview of the various applications and techniques of ESs. However, Liao (2005) does not address the use of ESs to increase energy efficiency and does not analyze any publications in this area. Biel and Glock (2016) examine literature from 1983 to 2015 dealing with decision support models for energy-efficient production planning. For this purpose, procedures for production systems, energy price laws, and energy efficiency criteria are considered. Although this literature analysis focuses on improving energy efficiency in production, it does not include ESs to achieve this objective. Similar to Liao (2005), Wagner (2017) provides a broad overview of ESs and their applications from 1984 to 2016. In comparison to Liao (2005), Wagner (2017) introduces an indicator to estimate and compare the success of ES applications. Among many other applications of ESs, this publication also deals with those in production. Nevertheless, applications for increasing energy efficiency are not discussed. Kumar (2019) focuses his literature review on applications of ESs in production planning regarding the handling of different products, process planning, tool selection, welding, and product development between 1981 and 2016, but without considering energy efficiency.\nUnlike the previously cited reviews, this work focuses on ESs to overcome environmental and economic challenges by improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. Other industrial sectors are also considered to ensure that the scope of the study is not overly restricted and to allow possible conclusions to be drawn about manufacturing. This is done through a systematic literature review (SLR) to give a comprehensive overview of the existing research. Starting from a total of 1692 publications, the 54 most relevant publications are extracted and categorized according to system boundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, ES type, and industry.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodological approach of the SLR, which is then applied in section 3. This involves all steps, from focusing the topic to identifying research gaps. Finally, section 4 draws a conclusion and presents proposals for future research."}, {"title": "2. Review methodology", "content": "To identify relevant publications on ESs for improving energy efficiency in manufacturing, a SLR is conducted. A SLR is a formal approach that aims to reduce bias due to an overly restrictive selection of the available literature and to increase the reliability of the literature selected (Tranfield et al., 2003). Moreover, a SLR can clarify the state of research on a topic and highlight gaps and areas requiring further research (Feak & Swales, 2009). The SLR in this paper follows the approach of Reynolds et al. (2003) as well as Glock and Hochrein (2011), which is complemented with elements of Tranfield et al. (2003) and consists of seven consecutive steps shown in Fig. 1. First, the topic is focused and conceptualized. When focusing the topic (I), categories and their definitions are formulated, as consistent classifications help to ensure reliability when conducting content analyses. In the conceptualization (II), research questions for the review itself as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria are formulated. Moreover, the keywords and the search query string are defined. Subsequently, databases suitable for the topic area are selected and searched (III). For this purpose, databases of previous literature analyses covering the same topic area or suggestions of university libraries for databases of individual research fields can be examined. For the literature search, we only consider metadata (title, abstract, keywords). Thereby we avoid publications which contain the search terms only in the bibliography. After merging hits from different databases, the literature is filtered (IV) by applying the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the next step, the full texts of the remaining publications are thoroughly analyzed (V). This involves extracting and summarizing relevant information from the publications. By performing backward and forward snowballing additional relevant publications are identified. Backward snowballing means using the reference list of selected literature to identify new publications to include. Forward snowballing, on the other hand, is carried out to find publications that cite the selected publication. The added publications pass through steps (III) to (V) again. During the synthesis (VI) of the literature essential characteristics are categorized. Finally, the findings are summarized, conclusions are derived with regard to the research questions, and research gaps are identified (VII)."}, {"title": "3.

Expert system type", "content": "ESs include a user interface, a knowledge base, and an inference engine. The interactions between humans and ESs happen via the user interface, e.g. to define a problem (input) or to read out the results (output). The knowledge base is the programmed knowledge of the expert and contains all pertinent facts and relationships as well as the rules or heuristics to solve problems. The inference engine is the \"intelligent\" part of an ES which can apply the knowledge from the knowledge base to solve the problem. (DeTore, 1989)\nThe way in which knowledge is represented within the knowledge base and how it is processed within the inference engine differs depending on the ES type. The typification of ESs in this paper is based on the categories in Liao (2005).\n\u2022 Rule-based expert system: A rule-based ES represents information in the form of IF-THEN rules. These rules are applied to perform operations on data in order to reach a conclusion (Liao, 2005).\n\u2022 Fuzzy expert system: Fuzzy ESs are characterized by dealing with uncertainties using fuzzy logic. While rule-based ESs only allow conditions or conclusions that are either true or false, fuzzy ESs allow also conditions or conclusions that are partly true or false. This approach is based on the premise that human experts often decide without precisely quantified information (Liao, 2005).\n\u2022 Machine-learning-based expert system: This type of ES uses machine leaning (ML) as its \"intelligent\" component to solve problems. Like ESs, ML belongs to the domain of artificial intelligence and combines a collection of data-driven algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML also includes deep learning and reinforcement learning.

For energy analysis, this means that the available observations at time t are used to predict the energy or energy efficiency at the same time t. (Walther & Weigold, 2021)\n\u2022 Forecasting: Statements are made about the future. In energy analyses, future values t + x for energy or energy efficiency are estimated based on current and/or past information at time t. (Box et al., 2015)"}, {"title": "3.2.

In terms of the manufacturing type , it can be observed that the use of ESs is concentrated on serial and mass manufacturing, i.e. in larger quantities. Concerning the application perspective , most of the studies address process planning and operation. The application purpose of ESs is primarily to increase energy transparency and perform energy optimization, but there are also some publications that predict or forecast information in the context of energy efficiency. Among the ES types , pure ML-based ESs are the least common. The other three dimensions, rule-based ES, fuzzy ES, and hybrid ES are approximately evenly represented.

The classification is hierarchically structured and is divided into sections, which are separated into divisions (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2023).\nWe can classify the publications into six industries. Some publications cannot be assigned clearly because they deal with cross-sectional technologies or do not provide any information about the exact industry. There is a noticeable concentration of the use of ESs in the manufacturing of metal goods. Furthermore, it shows again that with 65% the majority of ESs for improving energy efficiency are deployed in manufacturing (relevance group A)."}, {"title": "3.5.2. Utilizations of ESs in industry", "content": "Regarding the question of how ESs are applied to enhance energy efficiency in manufacturing (RQ2), it can be observed that ESs with a wider system boundary are more transferable than others with a more restricted system boundary. Thus, Dunning et al. (1999), Lau et al. (2008), S. Singh et al. (2016), Buccieri et al. (2020) as well as Grigoras and Neagu (2020) describe ESs with system boundaries covering entire factories but are rather utilized for preliminary or generic energy analyses. Some other publications with a more limited system boundary such as Garcia (2012), Do et al. (2014), P. P. Singh and Madan (2016), Petruschke et al. (2021) and Ioshchikhes et al. (2023) are applicable to similar use cases with few or no adjustments. The remaining publications in relevance group A describe ESs that are largely limited to individual case studies and cannot be transferred to other machines, systems or processes without further modification."}, {"title": "3.5.3. Structure and implementations of ESs", "content": "RQ3 addresses the structure and implementation of ESs. All ESs described within the analyzed 54 publications feature a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface, which are interconnected as shown in Fig. 7. Some of the publications, for instance, Buccieri et al. (2020) as well as Grigoras and Neagu (2020), additionally include distinct knowledge acquisition and explanation modules.\nThe expertise stored in the knowledge base can be represented in various forms. These include mathematical formulas (Keviczky et al., 1987), historical measurement data (Miyayama et al., 1991) physical and technical relationships (Tuma et al., 1996), rules (Lin et al., 2008), and facts (Do et al., 2014). Furthermore, as outlined by Buccieri et al. (2020), the knowledge base can be divided into short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory stores information for particular use cases for which ESs are applied. Whereas the long-term memory stores more general relationships, which correspond to the heuristic knowledge of human experts. Knowledge can be acquired using different techniques. Literature surveys are explicitly mentioned by Do et al. (2014) and Perera et al. (2023) as well as expert consultations by Do et al. (2014), Buccieri et al. (2020), and Perera et al. (2023). The optional knowledge acquisition module enables the knowledge base to be enriched with new content while the ES is already deployed. Depending on the ES type, it varies how the knowledge is represented in the knowledge base and how the inference engine utilizes the knowledge stored in the knowledge base to gain insights or solve problems.\nThe communication between humans and the ES (human-machine interface) can be realized by different means, including interactive questionnaires (Keviczky et al., 1987), dialog boxes (Dunning et al., 1999), measurement data inputs (Ioshchikhes et al., 2023), text outputs and graphics (Ochoa & Capeluto, 2015). The optional explanation module clarifies the reasoning process in order to make it comprehensible and thus promote acceptance of the findings presented by the ES (Buccieri et al., 2020).\nAs the analyzed publications reveal, the software implementation of ES can be highly diverse. Keviczky et al. (1987) use Fortran and Assembler as programming languages. More recent publications implement their ESs in Excel (Do et al., 2014), C language (Iqbal et al., 2015), CLIPS (Buccieri et al., 2020), Python (Petruschke et al., 2021), and LabVIEW (Jinling Wang et al., 2023). Deng et al. (2018), Ioshchikhes et al. (2022), and Li et al. (2022) use combinations of different programming languages to integrate simulation models or databases as part of the ESs."}, {"title": "3.5.4. Development of ESs for industrial applications", "content": "Many analyzed publications follow similar sequential and sometimes iterative steps in the development of their ES. These steps are:\n\u2022 Situation analysis: Create an overview of the situation and examine the problem to be solved (Lau et al., 2008).\n\u2022 Parameter identification: Identification of important and interactive parameters and factors, i.e. those that are both controllable (Monedero et al., 2012) and influential (Li et al., 2022).\n\u2022 Data generation and acquisition: Data is generated and collected using simulation models (Keviczky et al., 1987) or experiments (Iqbal et al., 2015). Experimental data generation is more common in the analyzed publications.\n\u2022 Data cleaning and preprocessing: Data filtering (Monedero et al., 2012), scaling (Debnath et al., 2019) and further preprocessing such as discriminant analysis (Monedero et al., 2012) or feature extraction (Jinling Wang et al., 2023) is performed.\n\u2022 Creation of a knowledge base and knowledge representation: Knowledge is gathered and represented as described in section 3.5.3.\n\u2022 Modeling: Build mathematical models (Li et al., 2022), fuzzy models, or data-driven models such as neural networks (Tuma et al., 1996). The development steps of the modeling process depend on the respective model type.\n\u2022 Application and validation: The ES can be qualitatively validated via user interviews and quantitatively through case studies (Li et al., 2022).\nBuccieri et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2022) specify corresponding development methods. Buccieri et al. (2020) follow an incremental development model exclusively for the computational implementation, without providing a detailed description of the individual phases. Li et al. (2022) base the entire development of their ES on a design science method. The method described by Li et al. (2022) comprises three phases: conceptual design phase, tool development phase, as well as application and validation phase. During the conceptual design, influential factors are selected, calculation rules are defined, and iteratively refined. Subsequently, the computational implementation follows during the tool development. Finally, the ES is validated both qualitatively and quantitatively.\nTo summarize, various development approaches for ESs can be found with some similarities in the context of improving industrial energy efficiency. Most development approaches, except for those described by Buccieri et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2022), cannot be associated with a superior methodological approach. In the area of manufacturing, no established process model with a detailed description of the individual steps for developing ESs to increase energy efficiency could be found."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents a SLR that identifies, summarizes, and analyzes ESs to improve energy efficiency in industry with a focus on manufacturing. The research follows a formal approach consisting of seven consecutive steps, aiming to reduce bias and increase the reliability of the literature selected. This led to 54 publications that were analyzed in depth. To organize the findings, the proposed ESs were classified according to system boundary, manufacturing type, application perspective, application purpose, and ES type. Subsequently, the raised research questions were answered, and research gaps were identified.\nRegarding existing literature concerning ESs, the main contribution of this work lies in the special focus on improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. Other industries were also considered to allow a full assessment of manufacturing. We classified this topic into different classes, dimensions, and industries. Furthermore, we examined the structure, implementation, utilization, and development of ESs in this context.\nWithin the scope of this study, there are some limitations in terms of covering the state of the art in the investigated research area. The exclusive reliance on digital sources and the deliberate overlook of older publications potentially causes a bias toward recent findings. Another limitation results from the language restriction, although only one of the 54 publications analyzed was not written in English.\nNonetheless, this study provides a comprehensive review of the topic area covered. The analysis of the selected publications led to several observations that can be highlighted and discussed. While illustrates a rise in the number of publications, it offers no insight into whether the observed trend results from an increased interest in the topic or a consequence of the broader expansion of research and scientific output. However, the comparison between the two relevant groups shows a greater growth in the number of publications in group A over the last ten years. This might be a consequence of the increasing attention being paid to sustainability in manufacturing. The authors' country affiliation can also be interpreted against the background of various factors. Countries with large populations, a strongly established secondary economic sector, and high spending on research have yielded more publications in the researched area than others. Moreover, the answer given to RQ1 combined with the categorization by manufacturing type suggests that ESs for improving energy efficiency are of particular interest to companies with high energy consumption and large output quantities. This could be related to the initial development effort arising from the lack of established process models (RQ4) and the low transferability of ESs to other use cases (RQ2).\nThe answers provided to the research questions revealed research gaps that can be addressed in future research. Thus, the question arises as to why ESs are used more frequently in certain industries (RQ1) than in others and what reasons, such as energy consumption, output quantities, or digitalization, play a decisive role in this. Furthermore, it became apparent that in most cases ESs are not transferable to other machines, systems, or processes (RQ2). While advantageous for increasing energy efficiency and preserving knowledge, it also means a high initial development effort for each individual use case, which can pose a barrier to implementation. Exploring the transferability aspect in the development of ESs could be a subject of future research. Regarding the structure and implementation of ESs (RQ3), it has been revealed that although all described ESs have a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface, their implementation is highly diverse. Accordingly, it was also pointed out that there is still no established method for the development of ESs to increase energy efficiency in manufacturing."}, {"title": "CReditT authorship contribution statement", "content": "Borys Ioshchikhes: Conceptualization, Methodology, Investigation, Writing - Original Draft, Visualization.

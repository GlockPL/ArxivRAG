INTRODUCTION", "content": "The growth of mobile data traffic and the evolving com- munication demands present significant challenges for future wireless networks [1]. Dense small cell (DSC) networks, where numerous small cell base stations (SBSs) are deployed within a given area, are regarded as a promising solution to address these challenges [2]. Through the placement of a massive number of short-range, low-power, and cost-effective SBSs, spatial multiplexing is enhanced, leading to increased system capacity [3]. Additionally, the close proximity of SBSs allows for the provision of low-latency services and enhances energy efficiency through short-range wireless transmission [4], [5]."}, {"title": "A. Related Works", "content": "In contrast to the power minimization problem that can be reformulated as second-order conic programming (SOCP) [12] or semidefinite programming [13], [14], the sum rate maximization problem has been proven to be NP-hard in [15]. Thus it is challenging to transform the sum-rate maximization problem into a convex optimization problem. Various sub- optimal methods have been proposed to tackle the sum rate maximization problem. These techniques, such as the weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm [16], the branch-and-bound algorithm [17] and the fractional program- ming algorithm [18] are employed in CB. The WMMSE algorithm [19] and the iterative SOCP-based algorithm [20] are utilized in coherent JT. However, the sum rate expression of the noncoherent JT technique is different from those of CB and coherent JT. These distinctions make existing algorithms for CB and coherent JT unsuitable for straightforward application in noncoherent JT scenarios. Specifically, in CB, each UE receives the useful signal from a single SBS, whereas in JT, the useful signal is jointly transmitted by multiple SBSs. In coherent JT, the coordinated SBSs for each UE can be regarded as a virtual antenna array with a large number of antennas. Conversely, in noncoherent JT, the data is independently encoded at each SBS, and the UEs achieve power gain through the noncoherent combination of received signals [20]. To tackle the challenge of maximizing the sum rate with noncoherent JT, a well-studied reference [21] introduces a globally optimal algorithm based on the branch-and-bound method and proposes a low-complexity solution using the inner approximation (InAp) method and its distributed algo- rithm, i.e., Inap-ADMM. While the Inap-ADMM algorithm provides solutions that achieve near-optimal performance, it requires a substantial number of interactions among base stations (BSs) and involves an iterative optimization process with high computational complexity. Implementing the InAp- ADMM algorithm in DSC networks may lead to significant information overhead and computational complexity due to the large number of SBSs [22]. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a noncoherent JT scheme with extremely low information overhead and computational complexity in DSC networks.\nIn recent years, advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) [23] and multi- agent reinforcement learning (MARL) [24], have presented novel approaches for addressing intricate challenges within the wireless communication and networking fields. These machine learning methodologies show notable advantages over traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of compu- tational complexity and information overhead. By allowing multiple agents to learn collaboratively in a shared environ- ment, MARL provides us with a distributed perspective on solving beamforming problems in DSC systems.\nIn the relevant literatures concerning MARL, two primary methodologies are commonly employed to address beam- forming challenges. The first approach is a codebook-based beamforming scheme [25]\u2013[29], where beamforming vectors are generated by selecting beamforming directions and trans- mission power from the predefined codebook and discrete power levels. While the codebook-based beamforming meth- ods offer advantages such as reduced action space and easier convergence, they may suffer performance loss due to potential mismatches between codebooks and channel characteristics. The second approach, known as the optimal solution structure- based beamforming scheme [30], [31], generates beamforming vectors by outputting the unknown parameters of the op- timal solution structure. This method not only streamlines the parameters of the beamforming vectors but also yields performance levels close to optimal by leveraging the optimal solution structure. A distributed DRL-based scheme has been proposed in [30] for a multi-cell CB system, utilizing the optimal solution structure to determine interference leakage control and background noise control factors for downlink beamforming. An optimal solution structure for multi-cell coherent JT, as proven in [32], derives a weighted combination of multiple zero-forcing (ZF) vectors and one maximum ratio transmission (MRT) vector. Building upon this optimal structure, a beamforming learning network is proposed in [31] aimed at determining various weighting parameters in the optimal solution. In our previous work [33], a simple solution structure-based MARL scheme is proposed to maximize the system sum rate under noncoherent JT, achieving near-optimal performance when the SBS is equipped with a single antenna. However, our previous scheme suffers from performance loss in scenarios with multi-antenna SBSs due to the lack of guaranteed optimality of the simple solution structure for multi-antenna SBSs."}, {"title": "B.

To the best of our knowledge, by employing noncoherent JT in DSC multiple- input single-output (MISO) networks, it is still an open chal- lenge to design an efficient decentralized method with the aim of maximizing the sum rate. Drawing inspiration from the existing MARL schemes rooted in optimal beamforming structures, this study proposes a distributed noncoherent JT scheme based on the optimal beamforming structure and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to maximize the sum rate in DSC MISO networks. By formulating an optimal beamforming structure for noncoherent JT, the variable di- mensionality is considerably reduced.

Sum-Rate Maximization and Power Minimization\n\nThe difficulty in optimizing objective (6a) due to its non- convex and NP-hard characteristics makes it challenging to find an optimal solution by solving Problem 1 directly. How- ever, it is possible to derive the optimal beamforming structure for Problem 1. In the following, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for the considered sum-rate maximization problem and the power minimization problem. Then we obtain the optimal beamforming structure by solving the power minimization problem. In particular, we minimize the transmit power by sequentially fixing the beamforming vectors of the other J-1 SBSs and updating the beamforming vectors of the considered SBS, that is the jth SBS. When fixing the beamforming vectors of the other J 1 SBSs, the received signal of UE k can be reformulated as (7), as shown at the bottom of the page. The SINR of UE k can be reformulated as (8),\n$$SINR_{k} = \\frac{\\left |\\sum_{j \\in J} h_{j,k}v_{j,k}\\right |^{2} + S_{j,k}}{\\sum_{j \\in J} \\sum_{n \\in K\\backslash k} \\left |h_{j,k}v_{j,n}\\right |^{2} + I_{j,k} + \\sigma^{2}},$$\nwhere Sj,k and Ij,k are the sum of the desired signal power and interference power transmitted to UE k by all SBSs except SBS j, respectively, which are determined as\n$$S_{j,k}= \\sum_{m \\in J \\backslash j} |h_{m,k}v_{m,k}|^{2},$$\n$$I_{j,k} = \\sum_{m \\in J \\backslash j}\\sum_{n \\in K\\backslash k}|h_{m,k}v_{m,n}|^{2}.$$\nIn order to determine beamforming vectors {vj,k}k\u2208K for the power minimization of SBS j, we solve the following problem.\nProblem 2 (The power minimization of SBS j with SINR constraints):\n$$\\underset{\\{V_{j,k}\\}_{k\\in K}}{\\text{minimize}} \\sum_{k\\in K}||v_{j,k}||^{2},$$\n$$ \\gamma_{k} \\leq SINR_{k}(\\{v_{j,k}\\}), \\forall k \\in K$$\nwhere Yk is the SINR requirement of UE k.\nTheorem 1. The optimal beamforming structure derived from Problem 1 and Problem 2 are the same.\nProof: Suppose we are given the SINR values SINR,\u2026\u2026, SINR achieved by the optimal solution to Problem 1. If we set Yk =SINR, \u2200k \u2208 K, and then solve Problem 2 using these specific Lagrange multipliers, the resulting beamforming vectors that solve Problem 2 would also be applicable to Problem 1. This can be explained by the fact that Problem 2 identifies beamforming vectors that achieve the SINR values SINR,\u2026, SINRK. The solution derived from Problem 2 must adhere to the total power constraint in Problem 1, as it achieves the specified SINR with minimal power consumption. Given that the beamforming vectors derived from Problem 2 satisfy both the power constraints of Problem 1 and achieve the optimal SINR values of Problem 1, consequently they are also optimal to Problem 1.\nAccording to Theorem 1, we can obtain the optimal beam- forming structure for the sum rate maximization problem, which is the same as the optimal beamforming structure for the power minimization problem as shown in the following subsection. Once the relationship between these two problems is clarified, the subsequent discussion will outline the approach for identifying the optimal beamforming structure and detail- ing its distinctive attributes."}, {"title": "B.

We construct the Lagrangian function and KKT conditions of Problem 2, where the SINR constraints (11b) is substituted by (12). The Lagrangian function of P2 can be expressed as (13), shown at the bottom of the page. Yk \u2265 0 is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the kth SINR constraint.

A DISTRIBUTED DDPG-BASED ALGORITHM", "content": "In this section, we propose a DDNJT scheme to address the sum rate maximization problem by exploiting the optimal beamforming structure.\n\nA. The Process of the Proposed Scheme\n\nIn the considered problem, the beamforming direction is determined by the SINR feedback received from the UE in the previous time slot. The data rate is designed as a reward to maximize SINR via the DDPG algorithm as shown in the following subsection. The optimization of beamforming power for all UEs involves continuous variables. To address this, the DDPG technique is employed, known as an actor- critic DRL-based algorithm designed for continuous control tasks. The procedure of the DDNJT scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. The DDPG algorithm typically comprises two primary networks: the critic network and the actor network. Each of these networks includes two subnetworks: the online network and the target network, sharing similar architectures.\nIn this setup, both the actor networks and critic networks are established at each SBS, allowing each SBS to train its individual actor and critic networks. All agents sharing a common configuration, the specifics are detailed for a single agent for brevity. In this context, the state of an agent is de- noted as s, representing extracted features from environmental observations. The precise definition of these RL features are provided in Section IV.C. The agent employs the online actor network to generate an action \u03c0(\u03c2|\u03b8oa) based on its current state, where \u03c0(\u00b7|\u03b8oa) represents the policy of the online actor network with weights \u03b8oa. In order to balance exploration and exploitation, noise n is added to the action and its value is clipped to the vaild value in [0, 1], which can be expressed as\n$$a = \\text{clip} (\\pi(\\varsigma | \\theta_{oa}) + n, [0, 1]) .$$\nThen each SBS calculates the beamforming directions for all UEs based on the data rates feedback from all UEs in the previous time slot, following lines 4-10 in Algorithm 1. The beamforming vectors are constructed based on the beamforming directions and the beamforming power for all UEs. Following this, all SBSs simultaneously execute nonco- herent JT using the designed beamforming vectors. In order to obtain the reward, each UE estimates the actual amount of the transmitted data and provides this data rate as feedback to all SBSs. The agent then gathers the data rates from all UEs to calculate the reward r, which will be further explained in subsequent sections. The agent moves to the subsequent state s' and logs an experience $ = (s, a, r, s'). These experiences are stored within the individual experience pool of the agent, denoted as M, with a maximum capacity of Mp. When the pool reaches its capacity, a subset, known as a mini-batch, is randomly selected from the experience pool for the purpose of updating the critic and actor networks.\nIn the DDPG algorithm, the evaluation of actions is per- formed by the Q-value function Q(s, a doc) of the online critic network, where loc represents the weights of the online critic network. The agent randomly chooses a mini-batch B = {Sb, ab, rb, s}, which consists of Mb experiences sampled from its pool M. The loss function of the online critic network is defined as follows:\n$$L(\\theta^{c}_{o}) = \\frac{1}{M_{b}}\\sum_{b \\in B} \\left (r_{b} + \\eta Q(\\varsigma_{b}^{\\prime}, \\pi(\\varsigma_{b}^{\\prime}|\\theta_{oa}) | \\theta_{tc}) - Q(\\varsigma_{b}, a_{b} | \\theta^{c}_{oc})\\right )^{2},$$\nwhere \u03b7 is the discount factor, Ota is the weights of the target actor network, Otc is the weights of the target critic network. The gradients for updating the weights of the online actor network are calculated as\n$$J(\\theta_{oa}) = - \\frac{1}{M_{b}}\\sum_{b \\in B} \\left [\\nabla_{a}Q(\\varsigma, a|\\theta^{c}_{oc})|_{\\varsigma=\\varsigma_{b}, a=\\pi(\\varsigma_{b}|\\theta_{oa})}\\nabla_{\\theta_{oa}} \\pi(\\varsigma|\\theta_{oa})|_{\\varsigma=\\varsigma_{b}}\\right ],$$\nwhere J(0oa) represents the loss function of the online actor network. Finally, the agent gradually modifies the target net- works within both the critic and actor networks through a soft update approach, namely,\n$$\\theta_{ta} \\leftarrow \\tau\\theta_{oa} + (1 - \\tau)\\theta_{ta}, \\theta_{tc} \\leftarrow \\tau\\theta_{oc} + (1 - \\tau)\\theta_{tc},$$\nwhere is a small constant.\nIt has been demonstrated that the network can achieve rapid convergence using an appropriate set of parameters [34].\nB. RL Elements\nNext, we will provide comprehensive exposition on the action, the state, and the reward of the proposed scheme to maximize the sum rate.\n1) Actions: The most straightforward approach to optimize beamforming using machine learning methods is to employ deep neural networks to directly generate beamforming vectors for all UEs. However, beamforming vectors are typically high-dimensional complex vectors with particular power con- straints, posing challenges for an agent to determine the optimal beamforming vectors through restricted trial-and-error engagement with the environment. As stated in Theorem 2, the optimal beamforming directions of all UEs can be obtained by a closed-form according to the local CSI. Each SBS only needs to obtain the beamforming power of all UEs according to its actions, rather than the beamforming vectors of all UEs. Consequently, with the exploitation of Theorem 2, the action space of SBS j (j \u2208 I) is given by\n$$a_{j}(t) = \\{a_{j,1}(t),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, a_{j,k}(t), a_{j}(t)\\} .$$\nwhere aj,k(t) \u2208 [0,1] is the beamforming power factor, and\n$$a_{j,k}(t)/\\left (\\sum_{k=1}^{K}a_{j,k}(t)\\right )$$\ndenotes the ratio of the allocated beamforming power for UE k to the total transmit power of SBS j. aj(t) \u2208 [0, 1] is the ratio of the total transmit power of SBS j to the maximum transmit power. Therefore, the allocated beamforming power for UE k by SBS k at time slot t can be depicted as follows\n$$P_{j,k}(t) = \\frac{a_{j,k}(t)}{\\sum_{k \\in K}a_{j,n}(t)} a_{j}(t) P_{max}$$\nHence, the overall tally of feasible actions is Na = K+1, and correspondingly, the overall tally of output ports is equivalent to Na.\n2) States: The states of an agent should comprise repre- sentative features derived from environmental observations, obtained through information feedback between SBSs and UEs. Each agent acquires a local observation of the environ- ment, i.e., local CSI of all UEs. Since neural networks do not handling complex numbers directly, an In-phase/Quadrature (I/Q) transformation is utilized, converting the complex chan- nel vector to a real vector. Specifically, the complex vector H;(t) \u2208 CK\u00d7Nt is divided into its real and imaginary com- ponents, which are then recombined into a new real column vector denoted as \u0124;(t) \u2208 R2KN\u0141\u00d71. Thus, the state of SBS jat time slot t is given by:\n$$S_{j} (t) = \\{\\hat{H}_{j}(t)\\} .$$\nThe overall tally of input ports is N\u2083 = 2KNt.\n3) Reward: A well-designed reward function is crucial for the final performance. In order to maximize the objective function in (6a), the sum rate of DSC MISO networks is established as the reward for all SBSs. By designing all SBSs to share the same reward, they work towards a common goal, i.e., maximizing the sum rate, which improves coordination among agents and promotes system stability. Therefore, the reward of SBS k at time slot t can be calculate as\n$$r_{j}(t) = r (t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} C_{i} (t).$$\nwhere Ck(t) is the actual amount of the data rate of UE k at time slot t.\nC. Network Architecture\nThe architecture design of the network plays a pivotal role, and striking the right balance is crucial. An excessive number of neurons can give rise to problems like slow convergence, overfitting, and heightened computational complexity. Con- versely, having too few neurons can lead to a performance decline. Fully-connected neural network (FCN) is used for the considered network architecture. The considered network structure consists of an input layer with Ns neurons and an output layer with Na neurons. Further, two hidden layers are included in the network structure, with sizes of 2[log2Ns]+3 and 2[log2N$]+2 neurons, respectively. These values are chosen empirically to achieve a harmonious equilibrium between the trade-off between performance, convergence speed, and complexity."}, {"title": "V.

Further specific parameters are provided in Table I for reference.\nFor comparison, different existing schemes (i.e., optimiza- tion schemes, MARL schemes and heuristic schemes) are used as benchmark schemes as follows:\n\u2022 InAp [21]: All SBSs use global CSI to collaboratively optimize beamforming vectors to maximize the sum rate.\n\u2022 KKT: Assuming that we know the optimal SINR values of Problem 1, each SBS obtains beamforming vectors from Algorithm 1. The SINR values is calculated by the InAp algorithm.\n\u2022 KKT-fully distributed (FD): Assuming that we know the optimal SINR values of Problem 1, each SBS obtains the beamforming vectors by independently minimizing its own transmitting power, regardless of the collaboration among all SBSs. The SINR values is calculated by the InAp algorithm. Specifically, the beamforming power for all UEs can be expressed as\n$$ = M^{-1}\\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma^{2} \\\\ : \\\\ \\sigma^{2}  \\end{bmatrix},$$,\nwhere M is given in (19).\n\u2022 MRT-DQN [33]: Each SBS employs MRT beamforming and DQN-based power allocation scheme.\n\u2022 RZF: Each SBS utilizes regularized zero forcing (RZF) beamforming to serve all UEs.\n\u2022 RZF-Greedy: Each SBS utilizes RZF beamforming at full transmit power to serve the UE with the largest channel gain.\n\u2022 MRT-Greedy: Each SBS utilizes MRT beamforming at full transmit power to serve the UE with the largest channel gain.\nB. Performance Comparison and Analysis"}, {"title": "D. Generalization Capability of the Proposed DDNJT Scheme", "content": "The comparison of the sum rate performance of various schemes under varying numbers of SBS is illustrated in Fig. 8. Fluctuations in the number of SBSs may arise from factors such as signal reception issues or SBS malfunctions. In the simulation, the number of SBSs decreases from J = 12 to J = 8. The depicted graph shows that all schemes exhibit performance variations in response to changes in the number of SBS. In contrast to changes in positions of UEs, the proposed scheme can directly adapt to shifts in the SBS count without necessitating retraining. This adaptability stems from the utilization of an optimal beamforming configuration that remains unaffected by the number of SBS. Consequently, the proposed DDNJT scheme demonstrates robust generalization capabilities with respect to the number of SBSs, a critical attribute for DSC MISO networks."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this study, we investigate the sum rate maximization prob- lem for DSC MISO networks using noncoherent JT. We firstly prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we further derive the optimal beamforming structure by analyzing the power minimization problem with Lagrangian and K"}]}

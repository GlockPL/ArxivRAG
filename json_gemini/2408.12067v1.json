Dense small cell (DSC) networks, where numerous small cell base stations (SBSs) are deployed within a given area, are regarded as a promising solution to address these challenges [2]. Through the placement of a massive number of short-range, low-power, and cost-effective SBSs, spatial multiplexing is enhanced, leading to increased system capacity [3].

Thus it is challenging to transform the sum-rate maximization problem into a convex optimization problem. Various sub-optimal methods have been proposed to tackle the sum rate maximization problem. These techniques, such as the weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm [16], the branch-and-bound algorithm [17] and the fractional program-ming algorithm [18] are employed in CB. The WMMSE algorithm [19] and the iterative SOCP-based algorithm [20] are utilized in coherent JT. However, the sum rate expression of the noncoherent JT technique is different from those of CB and coherent JT. These distinctions make existing algorithms for CB and coherent JT unsuitable for straightforward application in noncoherent JT scenarios. Specifically, in CB, each UE receives the useful signal from a single SBS, whereas in JT, the useful signal is jointly transmitted by multiple SBSs. In coherent JT, the coordinated SBSs for each UE can be regarded as a virtual antenna array with a large number of antennas. Conversely, in noncoherent JT, the data is independently"}, {"title": "B. Contributions", "content": "The sum rate maximization problem with noncoherent JT is inherently nonconvex and NP-hard. To the best of our knowledge, by employing noncoherent JT in DSC multiple-input single-output (MISO) networks, it is still an open chal-lenge to design an efficient decentralized method with the aim of maximizing the sum rate. Drawing inspiration from the existing MARL schemes rooted in optimal beamforming structures, this study proposes a distributed noncoherent JT scheme based on the optimal beamforming structure and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to maximize the sum rate in DSC MISO networks. By formulating an optimal beamforming structure for noncoherent JT, the variable di-mensionality is considerably reduced. Leveraging the low-dimensional nature of the optimal beamforming structure, a DDPG-based distributed noncoherent JT (DDNJT) scheme is proposed, enabling the acquisition of beamforming vectors at each SBS with only local CSI and low computational complexity. The contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 By establishing a relationship between the power mini-mization problem and the sum rate maximization prob-lem, it is demonstrated that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both problems. By analyzing the power minimization with Lagrangian and KKT condi-tions, we mathematically derive an optimal beamforming structure for both problems. Within this optimal beam-forming structure, the optimal beamforming vectors can be constructed from the optimal beamforming directions and the optimal beamforming powers for all UEs. Addi-tionally, we propose a closed-form solution to obtain the optimal beamforming directions. This optimal beamform-ing structure enables each SBS to determine beamforming vectors with fewer parameters, thus significantly reducing the dimensionality of the optimization variables.\n\u2022 As existing optimization-based noncoherent JT scheme typically require global CSI and involve high computa-tional complexity in DSC MISO networks, we propose a DDNJT scheme by exploiting the optimal beamforming structure. Specifically, the beamforming direction is ob-tained by a closed-form solution, and the beamforming power is determined using the DDPG algorithm. The integration of closed-form solutions and neural networks effectively reduces computational complexity and infor-mation overhead, thereby promoting the application of noncoherent JT in SBSs.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through extensive simulations.

To address this, the DDPG technique is employed, known as an actor-critic DRL-based algorithm designed for continuous control tasks. The procedure of the DDNJT scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. The DDPG algorithm typically comprises two primary networks: the critic network and the actor network. Each of these networks includes two subnetworks: the online network and the target network, sharing similar architectures.\nIn this setup, both the actor networks and critic networks are established at each SBS, allowing each SBS to train its individual actor and critic networks.

RL Elements", "content": "Next, we will provide comprehensive exposition on the action, the state, and the reward of the proposed scheme to maximize the sum rate.\n1) Actions: The most straightforward approach to optimize beamforming using machine learning methods is to employ deep neural networks to directly generate beamforming vectors for all UEs. However, beamforming vectors are typically high-dimensional complex vectors with particular power con-straints, posing challenges for an agent to determine the optimal beamforming vectors through restricted trial-and-error engagement with the environment. As stated in Theorem 2, the optimal beamforming directions of all UEs can be obtained by a closed-form according to the local CSI. Each SBS only needs to obtain the beamforming power of all UEs according"}, {"title": "", "content": "Consequently, with the exploitation of Theorem 2, the action space of SBS j (j \u2208 I) is given by\n$a_j(t) = \\{a_{j,1}(t),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, a_{j,k}(t), a_j(t)\\} $.\nwhere aj,k(t) \u2208 [0,1] is the beamforming power factor, and$\n\\frac{a_{j,k}(t)}{(\\sum_{k=1}^{K}a_{j,k}(t))}$ denotes the ratio of the allocated beamforming power for UE k to the total transmit power of SBS j. aj(t) \u2208 [0, 1] is the ratio of the total transmit power of SBS j to the maximum transmit power. Therefore, the allocated beamforming power for UE k by SBS k at time slot t can be depicted as follows\n$p_{j,k}(t) = \\frac{a_{j,k}(t)}{\\sum_{n \\in K} a_{j,n}(t)} a_j(t) P_{max}$\nHence, the overall tally of feasible actions is Na = K+1, and correspondingly, the overall tally of output ports is equivalent to Na.\n2) States: The states of an agent should comprise repre-sentative features derived from environmental observations, obtained through information feedback between SBSs and UEs. Each agent acquires a local observation of the environ-ment, i.e., local CSI of all UEs. Since neural networks do not handling complex numbers directly, an In-phase/Quadrature (I/Q) transformation is utilized, converting the complex chan-nel vector to a real vector. Specifically, the complex vector H;(t) \u2208 CK\u00d7Nt is divided into its real and imaginary com-ponents, which are then recombined into a new real column vector denoted as \u0124;(t) \u2208 R2KN\u0141\u00d71. Thus, the state of SBS j at time slot t is given by:\n$S_j (t) = \\{\\hat{H}_j(t)\\}$.\nThe overall tally of input ports is N\u2083 = 2KNt.\n3) Reward: A well-designed reward function is crucial for the final performance. In order to maximize the objective function in (6a), the sum rate of DSC MISO networks is established as the reward for all SBSs. By designing all SBSs to share the same reward, they work towards a common goal, i.e., maximizing the sum rate, which improves coordination among agents and promotes system stability. Therefore, the reward of SBS k at time slot t can be calculate as\n$r_j(t) = r (t) = \\sum_{i=1}^K C_i (t)$.\nwhere Ck(t) is the actual amount of the data rate of UE k at time slot t."}, {"title": "C.

Fig. 4 plots the sum rate of all the schemes as functions of the number of UEs. The main result shown in Fig.4 is that the performance of the RZF Greedy scheme and KKT-FD scheme significantly deteriorates as K increases, whereas all other schemes demonstrate enhancement. This indicates that except RZF Greedy and KKT-FD, other schemes can effectively utilize the user diversity gain. The reason for this difference may be the lack of effective collaboration among all SBSs in the RZF-Greedy scheme and the KKT-FD scheme. In addition, the results validate the observations shown in Fig.3, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms all heuristic schemes and the DQN-based scheme in all cases of K. Moreover, as the value of K escalates, the performance gap between the proposed scheme and heuristic schemes widens. This phenomenon can be attributed to the escalating interference within the DSC network as the number of UEs increases. Consequently, the proposed scheme demonstrates more substantial enhancements in sum rate by efficiently handling inter-UE interference.\nIn Fig. 5, the sum rate of all schemes is presented for different numbers of SBSs.

As the number of transmit antennas increases, the sum rate for all schemes increases because the SBS can utilize more antennas to en-hance array gain and manage inter-UE interference. Moreover, the incremental gain obtained from increasing Nt decreases as Nt grows. The rationale behind this phenomenon lies in the fact that the achievable rate is a concave function of SINR, suggesting that the increase in achievable rate can be interpreted as the marginal utility derived from SINR [30]. By increasing the number of transmit antennas, amplified array gain and improved interference control can be attained, conse-quently boosting SINR performance.

During the retraining process, we re-initialize the optimizers with the initial learning rate, while other parameters remain unchanged. The simulation settings are detailed in Table I and the corresponding simulation results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the sum rate of all schemes changes sharply in the 60000th time slot due to the abrupt changes of UEs' locations. Initially, upon the occurrence of this abrupt change, the proposed approach demonstrates a performance approx-imately 82% that of the InAp scheme, surpassing all other heuristic schemes. Subsequently, as the training progresses, the proposed scheme achieves convergence after approximately 6000 time slots, with its performance post-convergence reach-ing 93% of the InAp scheme.

The depicted graph shows that all schemes exhibit performance variations in response to changes in the number of SBS. In contrast to changes in positions of UEs, the proposed scheme can directly adapt to shifts in the SBS count without necessitating retraining.

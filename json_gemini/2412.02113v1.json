In\ntraditional ML models, this would be your dependent\nvariable, the question/issue that you are solving for.\nGiven the importance of this target, it is imperative\nthat the analyst digs deeper than the variable itself.\nFor instance, if the target is in content moderation, the\nsuperficial target is whether a target product contains\nviolation. But it is important that the analyst under-\nstands what is the criteria for violation. Understanding\nthe guideline, definition itself and why will help in\nprompt iteration and validating the prompt results.\n\u2022 Step 2: Creating a Golden Dataset\nOnce the target variable has been understood and set,\nthe next step is to create a golden dataset that contains\nthe target labels like traditional ML modeling work-\nflow. There are 3 things to consider in building a golden\ndataset:\n1. Identify the variables that will be used to predict\nthe target variable. These are the independent\nvariables that will be used to predict the target\nvariable, such as metadata coming from the prod-\nuct to review trust & safety of it. These fields\nwill be the input data used by the LLM prompt\nto identify the target variable.\n2. A sample of true positives and true negatives. The\ngolden dataset needs to contain labeled data with\nthe ground truth that has been rigorously vetted\nand accurate. This golden dataset will be used\nto determine recall and precision and the perfor-\nmance of the LLM prompt itself. Therefore, it\nis important that we have a trustworthy golden\ndataset.\nwhere the prematureness of the LLM is toler-\nated. However, in specific fields such as Trust\nand Safety, which directly impact end-users' dig-\nital well-being, this acceptable range should be\nnarrower than what an average LLM can accom-\nplish.\nTherefore, analogous to the Chain of Thought\n(CoT) approach, a chain of LLMs should be\nemployed to detect true positives and nega-\ntives, followed by an additional LLM at the\nend of the chain to identify harmful negative\ncases that should not be passed through the\nmodel.Jang et al., 2024 [JLLK24], Lin et al., 2021 [LHE21]\n3. Separate testing and validation sample. Ideally,\nthe golden dataset needs to be large enough such\nthat it can be separated into modeling and vali-\ndation samples. The LLM prompt can be devel-\noped on the modeling sample where the precision\nand recall is observed. These results should then\nbe validated using the validation sample. Having\nconsistent precision and recall across both samples\nlimits the risk of sampling bias and over-fitting.\nIn the case where no golden dataset is available, it is\nstill possible to build an LLM prompt and run the ex-\nperiment without one. Once the results of the LLM are\ncollected, a manual review can be done to create the\nground truth. With this ground truth the analyst will\nbe able to test for precision and recall. This method\nmay be inefficient and will be dependent on the number\nof manual reviews that can be done.\n\u2022 Step 3: Creating the Prompt In creating an effective\nprompt, 2 key concepts should be considered:\n1. Simplicity using simple direct prompts is bet-\nter than overly complicated prompts with com-\nplex directions. Be concise and to the point when\nproviding direction in a prompt.\n2. Clarity be as clear as possible in what you are\nlooking for. If it is a probability score, be direct\nand describe the output you want the LLM to\ngenerate.\n\u2022 Step 4: Prompt Iteration\nIt is important to try multiple variations of the prompt.\nUse the outputs of the previous prompts and make\nchanges to the language to get the desired outcome.\nMuch can be learned from analyzing the false positives\nand false negatives observations. These populations will\nindicate where the LLM is having difficulty and can\nprovide clues on how to fine-tune the prompt. Lastly,\nleverage the prompt optimization tools to refine your\nprompt.\nFurthermore, it is crucial to assess the dataset for\nredundancy and eliminate duplicate data points\nin the input to prevent inflated reasoning by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Deduplication is es-\npecially important when the dataset is compiled\nfrom multiple sources and the same item appears\nin a redundant manner.

Prompt injection and jailbreak attacks are two\nprominent threats that exploit weaknesses in LLMs, poten-\ntially leading to harmful consequences.\nPrompt Injection: This attack vector involves manipulat-\ning the input provided to an LLM by injecting malicious in-\nstructions disguised as legitimate prompts. This can trick the\nmodel into executing unintended actions, such as divulging\nsensitive information, bypassing safety filters, or even execut-\ning arbitrary code. Similar to traditional injection attacks like\nSQL injection, prompt injection exploits the LLM's inability\nto distinguish between legitimate instructions and malicious\nones. This vulnerability is particularly concerning when LLMs\nare integrated with external systems or have access to sensitive\ndata. Willison, 2022 [Wil22]\nJailbreak Attacks: LLMs are often trained with safety\nguidelines to prevent the generation of harmful or offensive\ncontent. Jailbreak attacks aim to circumvent these safety mea-\nsures by exploiting loopholes or inconsistencies in the model's\ntraining data or architecture. Xu et al., 2023 [XLT+23] These\nattacks utilize cleverly crafted prompts to elicit undesirable\noutputs, such as:\n\u2022 Generating biased or discriminatory content: A success-\nful jailbreak might induce the LLM to produce hate\nspeech or discriminatory remarks, despite being trained\nto avoid such outputs.\n\u2022 Producing harmful instructions: The LLM could be\ntricked into providing instructions for illegal or danger-\nous activities.\n\u2022 Revealing private information: Jailbreak attacks might\nlead to the leakage of sensitive data that the LLM was\ntrained on or has access to.\nThese attacks highlight the challenges in ensuring the\nresponsible and ethical use of LLMs. Researchers are ac-\ntively exploring defense mechanisms to mitigate these threats,\nincluding input sanitization techniques, adversarial train-\ning, and robust prompt engineering. This research by\nXu et al., 2023[XLT+23] contributes to the ongoing efforts in\nenhancing the security and trustworthiness of LLMs, paving\nthe way for their safe and reliable deployment in various ap-\nplications.\nRed-teaming: Red-teaming, a security assessment tech-\nnique simulating adversarial attacks, emerges as a crucial\nmethodology for identifying and mitigating these risks. It ne-\ncessitates a multifaceted strategy that encompasses a variety\nof techniques and methodologies aimed at uncovering vulnera-\nbilities and evaluating the robustness of existing safety mech-\nanisms. This process involves a deep dive into adversarial\nprompt engineering, wherein malicious prompts are meticu-\nlously crafted to exploit potential weaknesses, trigger unin-\ntended behaviors, or bypass the established safety filters. This\nencompasses various tactics, including prompt injection, where\nmalicious code or commands are subtly embedded within user\nprompts to manipulate the LLM's operational framework.\nGanguli et al., 2022 [GHLS22], Perez et al., 2022 [PR22]. Fur-\nthermore, jailbreaking techniques are employed, utilizing care-\nfully constructed prompts designed to circumvent safety guide-\nlines and elicit harmful or biased outputs [2]. Additionally,\ndata poisoning, the introduction of malicious data into the\ntraining dataset, represents another avenue for adversaries to\ninfluence the LLM's responses and introduce vulnerabilities [1].\nBeyond adversarial prompt engineering, red-teaming in-\ncorporates vulnerability scanning, employing automated tools\nand techniques to systematically probe the LLM for weaknesses\nand identify potential attack vectors. This is complemented by\ncomprehensive threat modeling, which involves analyzing po-\ntential threats and attack scenarios to fully understand the\nrisks associated with LLM deployment and prioritize mitiga-\ntion efforts. Crucially, the entire red-teaming process thrives\non collaboration and iteration, fostering a dynamic interplay\nbetween red teams, developers, and security researchers, en-\nabling continuous improvement of the LLM's security posture\nand a proactive response to emerging threats.\nWhile red-teaming is indispensable for bolstering LLM se-\ncurity, it is equally critical to ensure the responsible and eth-\nical utilization of LLMs throughout the process. This neces-\nsitates the establishment of a controlled environment where\nred-teaming activities are conducted in isolation to prevent\nunintended consequences and limit the potential impact of ma-\nlicious prompts. Furthermore, the formulation of clear ethical\nguidelines for red team activities is paramount, ensuring the\nresponsible use of LLMs and prohibiting actions that could\ninflict harm or violate privacy.\nData sanitization is another crucial aspect, requiring the\nmeticulous removal of sensitive or personally identifiable infor-\nmation from data used in red-teaming exercises to safeguard\nuser privacy. Underpinning all these measures is the vital role\nof human oversight, which must be seamlessly integrated into\nthe red-teaming process to ensure the responsible application\nof LLMs and prevent any unintended consequences.

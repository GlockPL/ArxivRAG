Nonetheless, current LLMs struggle to handle complex biological data and theoretical models in photosynthesis research and often fail to provide accurate scientific contexts. Therefore, this study proposed a photosynthesis research assistant (PRAG) based on OpenAI's GPT-40 with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and prompt optimization. Vector databases and an automated feedback loop were used in the prompt optimization process to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the responses to photosynthesis-related queries. PRAG showed an average improvement of 8.7% across five metrics related to scientific writing, with a 25.4% increase in source transparency. Additionally, its scientific depth and domain coverage were comparable to those of photosynthesis research papers. A knowledge graph was used to structure PRAG's responses with papers within and outside the database, which allowed PRAG to match key entities with 63% and 39.5% of the database and test papers, respectively. PRAG can be applied for photosynthesis research and broader plant science domains, paving the way for more in-depth data analysis and predictive capabilities.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Scientific research is a sophisticated process in which facts, concepts, and hypotheses interact intricately to create knowledge. Researchers have reviewed extensive academic literature and synthesized existing phenomena and theories using mathematical and logical concepts [1]. Although these tasks are essential for deriving insights and hypotheses, the cognitive burden of researchers has increased, particularly as interdisciplinary research expands [1-4]. These limitations are particularly evident in modern scientific research, which involves complex data processing and information overload.\nIn this context, large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential to support researchers' cognitive processes by partially simulating human language understanding and reasoning [5-7]. However, academic reviews on the extent to which LLMs can replace or support scientific thinking remain insufficient, with notable limitations in information accuracy and source transparency [8\u201310].\nPhotosynthesis research is a representative example of the complexity and cognitive burden of modern scientific research. Photosynthesis is a key process that maintains ecosystem stability by converting solar energy into chemical energy, thereby directly impacting climate change and food security [11-13]. Research in this field spans a wide range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, agricultural science, and environmental science, and the volume of available data has increased exponentially over recent decades [14-17]. However, owing to information overload, traditional analytical methods face challenges in efficiently processing large volumes of data and deriving significant insights [4, 18, 19].\nTo address these challenges, we proposed a specialized photosynthesis research as-sistant (PRAG) by employing OpenAI's GPT-40 model with the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique with prompt optimization to a database of photosynthesis research papers (Fig. 1). PRAG ensures transparency in citations based on actual research papers and is specialized for photosynthesis research. For instance, PRAG demonstrated an average improvement of 8.7% over the baseline GPT-40 model across five metrics (scientific accuracy, research goal fit, source transparency, academic tone, and information reliability) required for scientific paper writing, with a notable 25.4% improvement in source transparency. Although PRAG used only 5% of the text from papers in the cited literature, its responses to photosynthesis research paper hypotheses reached or exceeded the levels of scientific depth (102.3%) and domain coverage (99.3%), thus reflecting the enrichment of knowledge and indicating the academic scope of the discussion. Even for papers not included in the database, PRAG matched approximately 39.5% of the key entities of test papers, and an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of concepts showed a high correlation between the two datasets, with R\u00b2 = 0.65 (test paper's entities) and 0.61 (PRAG's entities).\nThe photosynthesis-specialized PRAG can inspire researchers by proposing hypothe-ses, partially performing the scientific discovery cycle, and linking these hypotheses to predictions or discussions. To illustrate this function, we utilized a knowledge graph to organize and compare PRAG's responses to hypotheses from papers within and outside the database (Fig. 1b). For instance, PRAG elaborated on the impact of far-red photons on C3 and C4 photosynthesis at the molecular level through cyclic electron flow, expand-ing the discussion to areas such as agricultural and environmental dimensions, including crop productivity and ecosystem photosynthesis.\nThis study has demonstrated that enhancing existing LLMs with RAG techniques and prompt optimization can effectively integrate and expand the extensive academic literature in the field of photosynthesis, thereby alleviating researchers' cognitive burden and supporting the scientific reasoning process."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Model Enhancement", "content": "To improve GPT-40 to support photosynthesis research, we used a prompt optimiza-tion approach that combined RAG techniques with a self-feedback mechanism.

Com-\npared with the baseline model combined only with RAG, the combination of RAG and\nprompt optimization further improved the response performance (Fig. 2b). This pro-\nduced encouraging results within the PRAG model evaluation framework. For example,\nthe performance improved across all five metrics required for scientific paper writing in\nboth the training and test sets, achieving an average improvement of 8.7% compared with\nthe baseline model. Notably, PRAG showed a significant improvement in source trans-\nparency, which increased from 5.2 to 6.4 points, a 25.4% enhancement, through precise\ncitation references and text source documentation.\nGPT-40 (evaluated in June 2024) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in\nreasoning and text generation [19]. In this study, we employed GPT-40 by combining\nthe RAG technique with system prompt strategies to develop a photosynthesis research\nassistant model. The RAG technique expanded the knowledge scope of the model by\nembedding photosynthesis research papers into a vector database (DB), thereby signif-\nicantly improving information accuracy and response quality. Furthermore, the system\nprompts provide an academic tone, proper citation formatting, and specific guidelines,\nfurther improving the model's capabilities for scientific paper writing.\nTo continuously improve the quality of the model responses, we introduced iterative\nrefinement using a self-feedback approach (Fig. 2c). This method allowed the model to\nreceive its own feedback and use it for improvements, thereby ensuring consistent quality\nwithout direct human intervention. Through an automated feedback loop, the model\ncontinuously evaluates and enhances its performance by adapting to various questions and\ncontexts to provide more relevant responses. Following 10 iterations, PRAG optimized the\nprompts through self-feedback, generating relevant responses to user questions without\nrelying on human annotations or refined data. Ultimately, this approach enhanced user\nexperience and increased the model's reliability."}, {"title": "3.2 Research Text Visualization", "content": "To demonstrate that PRAG can contribute to scientific insights and findings as a pho-tosynthesis research assistant, we structured and visualized the response text of the model.\nFirst, 30 photosynthesis research papers were prepared for inclusion in the database, while\n30 were excluded from the database and used as test papers. Next, we converted the core\nclaims and hypotheses of these studies into questions. Subsequently, we saved PRAG's\nresponses (discussions) to these hypothesis questions as 60 PDFs to create data that were\ncomparative with the research papers.\nTo verify whether PRAG's discussions ensure scientific depth and domain coverage\nat the level of the cited literature, we evaluated the text of 150 photosynthesis research\npapers embedded in the vector DB based on the metrics of scientific depth and domain\ncoverage (Fig. 3a). The x-axis represents the domain coverage score, which measures how\nwell the research text integrates various disciplines related to photosynthesis, whereas the\ny-axis represents the scientific depth score, which indicates how deeply the research text\naddresses the scientific understanding of photosynthesis (Fig. 3b)."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "The research findings suggest that the performance improvement in response to pho-tosynthesis research questions can be attributed to the capabilities of the LLM enhanced by the combination of RAG and system prompts. Although RAG alone has limitations in improving model performance, combining it with system prompts creates a synergistic effect that significantly enhances performance. This is because RAG effectively retrieves contextually relevant information from outside the domain, whereas the system prompts provide the model with a clear role and identity, thereby improving the quality of the output. We confirmed that the reasoning ability of the model related to photosynthesis research was enhanced through the prompt optimization process that combined a cu-rated dataset with RAG and the clear instructions derived during that process. Various attempts have been made to utilize language models in the scientific field, including sev-eral inference-based LLMs [21\u201323]. However, PRAG achieved comparable results without fine-tuning, thereby leveraging the excellent performance of the backbone model.\nScientific reasoning abilities include identifying research gaps, developing questions and hypotheses, identifying and classifying entities, and providing evidence through mod-eling, making claims, and performing evaluations [24-26]. A well-structured scientific paper follows a C(Context)-C(Content)-C(Conclusion) structure, setting the context in the introduction, presenting content in the results, and drawing conclusions in the dis-cussion [27, 28]. In this regard, PRAG effectively identified the achievements of prior research and remaining knowledge gaps in literature (Fig. SI.2) and reproduced the re-search logic from hypothesis (context) to conclusion (conclusion). Furthermore, PRAG discussions present sufficient scientific depth and are applicable across various academic fields covered by the academic DB papers (Fig. 3).\nThe field of plant science commonly uses bottom-up approaches that explain the ef-fects of gene-level changes at the metabolomic, proteomic, and phenotypic levels and top-down approaches that explain specific phenotypes in the context of environmen-tal factors [26]. These processes enable the integration and understanding of complex biological phenomena related to photosynthesis. To understand how PRAG describes complex biological systems, we mapped it along with major concepts used in academic papers across various spatiotemporal scales. This demonstrated that the model does not remain at a localized scale but rather concretizes discussions from the macroenvironment to the molecular level (top-down approach) and extends time scales from immediate plant responses to long-term responses (bottom-up approach) (Fig. 4c; 5e).\nNotably, through the knowledge graph, PRAG was able to secure key concepts related to the hypotheses using only approximately 5% of the DB paper text, thus contributing to semantic expansion. This helps alleviate the cognitive burden of researchers and indicates that even very short texts can effectively summarize and integrate academic papers. By integrating the context of new citations, PRAG demonstrates its ability to provide an in-depth understanding of various topics, such as photosynthetic efficiency, agricultural productivity, crop resilience, and sustainable agriculture, and suggests future research directions. However, the expanded context may have led to differences in the correlations between data distributions by securing entities (concepts) across a wider range of spatiotemporal categories.\nMoreover, improving photosynthetic efficiency is not limited to increasing plant pro-ductivity but rather represents a key research area linked to various industrial and envi-ronmental issues, such as clean energy production and climate crisis mitigation. In this context, enzyme engineering has the potential to improve carbon metabolic pathways, with PRAG offering practical insights from a comprehensive database of photosynthesis-related literature, thereby helping researchers formulate experimentally testable hypothe-ses. Researchers can draw inspiration from PRAG's predictions and designs to enhance their understanding, thereby securing a theoretical background to further promote re-search performance. This demonstrates how LLMs can support researchers in the theo-retical and logical aspects of the scientific discovery cycle, particularly in the 'dry' phase where knowledge synthesis and hypothesis development occur. Just as systems biology advances scientific understanding through the complementary relationship between 'wet' (experiments) and 'dry' (computational analysis) approaches, our study shows that LLMs can effectively support researchers in the increasingly sophisticated knowledge synthesis and theoretical development process [29].\nHowever, the database of the present study was limited to 150 papers due to resource and cost constraints and thus may not fully represent the diversity and depth of certain research areas. Additionally, a risk of bias toward specific researchers or groups was observed; therefore, future studies should include data from diverse sources to improve the model's balance and accuracy. LLMs have limitations in interpreting numerical data. Therefore, incorporating multimodal features to analyze scientific charts and tables would be beneficial. Furthermore, ethical guidelines should be established to ensure fairness, accountability, and copyright protection to ensure the responsible use of LLMs.\nThe emergence of foundational models and LLMs presents a significant opportunity to advance AI development in plant science. Scientific breakthroughs in natural sci-ences demand clear, interpretable, and explainable domain knowledge [30]. In particular, photosynthesis exhibits spatiotemporal complexity spanning from molecular to ecosys-tem levels, and this study demonstrated that LLMs can effectively support parts of the scientific discovery process in such complex photosynthesis research.\nThis study presents a novel approach to handling specialized photosynthesis knowl-edge by combining a knowledge database with LLMs. To address the challenge of eval-uating semantic accuracy in text-based expert knowledge, we introduced a multifaceted validation methodology that incorporates entity matching, structural similarity, and spa-tiotemporal analysis through knowledge graphs. We demonstrated that PRAG extends beyond simple information retrieval and is able to comprehend the semantic relation-ships and contexts that exemplify expert knowledge. Moreover, it provides discussions at a level comparable to the original papers in terms of scientific depth and domain coverage using only a minimal portion of the source text. This suggests that LLMs can effectively support researchers by not only reducing their cognitive burden but also facilitating the complex process of knowledge integration and synthesis required in interdisciplinary re-search. Our multifaceted evaluation methodology serves as a framework for objectively validating LLM's contributions to the knowledge synthesis process in researchers' dry cycle and can be applied to future LLM research in other specialized fields."}, {"title": "5 Code Availability", "content": "The compiled code and files used in model development, including the API of the proprietary backbone model and the research data compiled into a database, are freely available for download at https://github.com/PRAG-SNU."}]}

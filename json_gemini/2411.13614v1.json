Software helps make life convenient. It controls our home appliances, automobiles, phones, and entertainment. It increases our productivity at work, speeds up our communication, and improves our medical care. It affects nearly every aspect of modern life. Software is the backbone of modern civilization, driving innovation and progress across industries. Whatever the future holds, software will remain a crucial part of it. Software is getting more complex due to many reasons, such as an increase in software application diversity, an increase in software platform types, and an increase reliability on \u201cthird-party\" software. As a consequence, it is crucial to produce reliable software. Software failure often may mean that some entertainment application is not entertaining as intended, or it could result in a life-or-death situation in a hospital or a mass transit system."}, {"title": "A. Phases of Software Product Development", "content": "Generally, the V-model is considered for software development and testing methodology. The V-model is considered a variant of the traditional Waterfall approach. Besides the standard Waterfall methodology's life cycle phases, which overflow one after the other in a linear development process. The V-model is categorized by a testing phase running in parallel to each development phase. The advance of the Waterfall methodology to integrate more distinct testing phases is described by the V-shaped infographic 1 which explains the advanced approach. The V-model represents the extended 'Verification and Validation model'. The book Developing and Managing Embedded Systems and Products \u2013 Methods, Techniques, Tools, Processes, and Teamwork by Kim R. Fowler and Craig L. [1] Silver defines the V-model's verification and validation components as follows:\u201cVerification is an objective set of tests to confirm that the product meets the metrics of the requirements, while validation seeks to demonstrate that the product meets the original intent.\""}, {"title": "B. Steps of the V-cycle", "content": "1) Requirements: Gathering the stakeholder requirements is essential for any feature implementation in a software module.These requirements can be external to the Organization driven from the Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM) or internal from the product team. These requirements are essential as they form the basis for the next steps in the process.\n2) Analysis and Architecture: This step involves the system and the software architecture. In other versions, it is also broken down into subsystem or component architecture. Tools like Cameo [2] and IBM Rhapsody [3] are used for modeling subsystems. Standardized tools are essential for mapping to requirements and code.\n3) Design: The system and software design phase involve designing all the sub -functions to realize the architecture. The functions should be detailed to start with unit design and coding in the next step.\n4) Coding and prototyping: This step is completely the expertise of software developers which involves writing code to realize the feature.\n5) Unit, model and subsystem tests: As we transition to the right side of the V-cycle, bottom up testing of the implemented feature is focused upon.

The three major types in Automotive are Motor in Loop(MIL), Software in Loop(SIL) and Hardware in Loop(HIL). These three tests are performed using different set of tools.

Some good quality HILs existing today are Vector HILs, the ETAS HIL [5]"}, {"title": "7) Acceptance tests", "content": "These are broken into Alpha and Beta tests. Alpha tests are for consumers internal to the Organization and Beta tests are for consumers external to the Organization. Every software roll out has a beta test associated to it. Sometimes alpha tests are missed. But beta tests are essentially carried out to check the confidence of the general public in the functionality. One good example is Tesla's self-driving feature [6] which has been rolled out in the United States as a Beta version and is accompanied by many updates to it as well."}, {"title": "C. V-cycle vs the traditional waterfall model", "content": "Traditional waterfall model did not have the scope to interact between different steps from Safety goal to Beta testing phase. The v-cycle model has those capabilities where is interaction between every phase on the left side of V-cycle to the right. This is the major advantage why all the product companies have adopted V-cycle model for development. These connections majorly help in fixing defects identified on the right side as they are communicated to the left side upon identification. This is for quicker turnaround of fixing defects in the software development cycle. This was not possible in the waterfall model. The final connection between Requirements and Acceptance testing is validation. The intermediate connections at earlier phases come under the umbrella of verification."}, {"title": "II.

{"title": "Large Language Model-Based Agents for Software Engineering: A Survey", "authors": ["Junwei Liu", "Kaixin Wang", "Yixuan Chen", "Xin Peng", "Zhenpeng Chen", "Lingming Zhang", "Yiling Lou"], "abstract": "The recent advance in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shaped a new paradigm of Al agents, i.e., LLM-based agents. Compared to standalone LLMS, LLM-based agents substantially extend the versatility and expertise of LLMs by enhancing LLMs with the capabilities of perceiving and utilizing external resources and tools. To date, LLM-based agents have been applied and shown remarkable effectiveness in Software Engineering (SE). The synergy between multiple agents and human interaction brings further promise in tackling complex real-world SE problems. In this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic survey on LLM-based agents for SE. We collect 106 papers and categorize them from two perspectives, i.e., the SE and agent perspectives. In addition, we discuss open challenges and future directions in this critical domain. The repository of this survey is at\nhttps://github.com/FudanSELab/Agent4SE-Paper-List.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) [1] have achieved remark-\nable progress and demonstrated potential of human-like\nintelligence. In recent years, LLMs have been widely ap-\nplied in Software Engineering (SE). As shown by recent\nsurveys [2], [3], LLMs have been adopted and shown\npromising performance in various software development\nand maintenance tasks, such as program generation [4]-\n[8], software testing [9]-[11] and debugging [12]-[17], and\nprogram improvement [18]-[20].\nAI Agents are artificial entities that can autonomously\nperceive and act on surrounding environments so as to\nachieve specific goals [21]. The concept of AI agents has been\nevolving for a long time (e.g., early agents are constructed\non symbolic logic or reinforcement learning [22]-[25]). Re-\ncently, the remarkable progress in LLMs has further shaped\na new paradigm of AI agents, i.e., LLM-based agents, which\nleverage LLMs as the central agent controller. Different from\nstandalone LLMs, LLM-based agents extend the versatility\nand expertise of LLMs by equipping LLMs with the capa-\nbilities of perceiving and utilizing external resources and\ntools, which can tackle more complex real-world goals via\ncollaboration between multiple agents or involvement of\nhuman interaction.\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive and systematic\nsurvey on LLM-based agents for SE.

Aligning these fundamentally different modalities in a mathematically rigorous and interpretable way remains an open problem.\nCurrent multimodal models, such as CLIP, achieve alignment by optimizing contrastive objectives over paired datasets, but these methods often lack a formal theoretical framework to model the alignment and disentanglement of shared and modality-specific features. As a result, understanding the geometry, robustness, and scalability of such models is challenging.

Geometric Interpretation", "content": "The decomposition Z = Zs \u2295 ZI \u2295 ZT can be analyzed through its geometric structure, which provides insights into the alignment and disentanglement of multimodal embeddings.\nManifold Interpretation The shared subspace Zs can be modeled as a low-dimensional manifold within the embedding space Z. This manifold captures the semantic \u201cintersection\u201d of image and text modalities, parameterizing cross-modal alignment. Formally, let Zs be a ds-dimensional Riemannian manifold embedded in Z, such that:\n$f_s(i), g_s(t) \u2208 Zs, \\quad f_I(i) \\perp Zs, \\quad g_T(t) \\perp Zs$.\nThe alignment objective then reduces to finding a mapping h : Zs \u2192 Z that minimizes the alignment error:\n$\\mathcal{E}_{align} = \\int_{Z_s} ||h(f_s(i)) - g_s(t)||^2 \u03bc_f(i)\u03bc_g(t) di dt$.\nProposition 9 (Manifold Alignment) If $Z_s$ is a compact manifold with curvature \u03ba, the optimal alignment mapping h : $Z_s$ \u2192 Z satisfies:\n$||h(f_s(i)) - g_s(t)|| \u2264 \u03f5 + \u03ba\u00b7dz(fs(i), gs(t)),$\nwhere dz is the geodesic distance on Zs. The curvature \u03ba bounds the deviation from exact alignment.\nProof The geodesic distance dz(fs(i), gs(t)) reflects the shortest path along the manifold Zs. For compact manifolds, curvature \u03ba introduces distortion in embedding mappings. The result follows from Riemannian geometry bounds on local embeddings.\nThis interpretation highlights the geometric constraints imposed by Zs, emphasizing the role of manifold regularity in improving alignment performance."}, {"title": "Fiber Bundle Interpretation", "content": "The decomposition Z = Zs \u2295 ZI ZT can also be viewed as a fiber bundle", "Specifically": "nZ$\\xrightarrow{\u03c0_s"}, "Zs \u00d7 F$, F = ZI \u00d7 ZT.\nEach point in $Z_s$ represents a shared semantic embedding, while the fiber F encodes modality-specific deviations. The alignment condition implies that for any zs \u2208 Zs:\n$\u03c0s(f(i)) = \u03c0s(g(t)) = zs,$\nwhere $\u03c0_s$ is the projection onto $Z_s$.\nProposition 10 (Fiber Bundle Consistency) Let f(I) and g(T) be mappings into Z, satisfying the decomposition Z = Zs \u2295 ZI \u2295 ZT. The fiber product:\n$\\mathcal{F}(z_s) = \\{(z_I, z_T) \u2208 F | f_I(i) + g_T(t) = z_s\\}$\nis non-empty if and only if:\n$||f_I(i)||^2 + ||g_T(t)||^2 = ||z_s||^2$.\nProof The fiber product condition ensures that zs is consistent with its projections fI(i) and gT(t). The orthogonality of the subspaces ZI and ZT implies that their norms add independently, preserving the total norm constraint.\nThis interpretation underscores the hierarchical structure of the embedding space, where $Z_s$ dictates the global alignment properties and F accommodates modality-specific details.\nGeometric Interpretation via Fiber Varieties The shared subspace Zs can also be understood as a fiber variety over a base moduli space. For instance, let \u03c0 : Z \u2192 M be a projection from the embedding space Z to a moduli space M, parameterizing semantic categories. Each fiber \u03c0\u22121(m) represents embeddings associated with a specific semantic category m \u2208 M. The shared subspace Zs then corresponds to the union of fibers aligned across modalities:\n$Z_s = \\cup_{"]}

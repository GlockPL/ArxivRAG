This technique is paramount in aging research[2].\nHowever, modeling DNA methylation age prediction effectively is complex due to two intrinsic properties of CpG\nmethylation. Firstly, the correlation between CpG site methylation levels and age is not static but changes with age,\nwhich we call Epigenetic Correlation Drift (ECD). Specifically, DNA methylation levels change rapidly during early\ndevelopment and adolescence, stabilize during adulthood, and may alter again in older ages [3, 4]. This nonlinearity[5]\nposes significant challenges for traditional age prediction models, which often assume a uniform rate of change across\nthe lifespan.

Aging is not a uniform process; it varies across\ndifferent periods of life, with some stages experiencing accelerated or decelerated aging. This variability can be captured\nby examining the contribution and interaction of CpG sites within specific age segments.\nFigure 2 presents a box plot of the absolute Pearson correlation coefficients between 2,374 age-related CpG sites and\nthe corresponding age windows. The graph illustrates the distribution of overall methylation rates within each age\ngroup in relation to their correlation coefficients, revealing distinct differences between the age windows. Notably, age\ngroups with correlation coefficients closer to zero tend to exhibit slower rates of aging.\nIn the 0-10 age range, the correlation is remarkably high, indicating a rapid rate of aging or growth during this period.\nA similarly fast rate of change is observed in the 10-20 age range. However, the aging rate appears to slow down in the\n20-30 age range, and further deceleration is observed in the 40-50 and 70-80 age ranges. Interestingly, the 100+ age\ngroup shows a very high correlation, likely due to the smaller sample size and increased variability at the end of life.\nThis high correlation suggests a faster rate of aging in this group, although this conclusion warrants validation with a\nlarger sample size.

Methods 13 high-level male short-distance speed skating athletes were selected as the test subjects, and kinematic data were collected using an artificial intelligence video capture and analysis system. The body posture features and their effects on the starting movement performance were analyzed in the three stages of starting preparation, starting, and sprinting. Results The post-stability angle, anterior knee angle of the front leg, posterior knee angle of the rear leg, and stride length showed moderate to high positive correlations with the starting speed during the starting preparation stage. The trunk angle showed a high negative correlation with the starting speed. The trunk angle (TO4, TD4, TO6, TD6), hip angle (TO1, TO4, TO6), and knee angle (TD1) showed moderate to high negative correlations with the effectiveness of the starting movement during the starting and sprinting stages. The knee angle (TD2), ice-contact angle (TD2, TD4, TD5, TD6), and propulsion angle (TO1, TO4, TO7) showed moderate positive correlations with the effectiveness of the starting movement. Conclusion Stride length, left knee angle, and post-stability angle are the key factors affecting the starting speed. The larger the post-stability angle and left knee angle and the longer the stride length, the faster the starting speed. During the starting and sprinting stages, the smaller the ice-contact angle and propulsion angle, the greater the trunk angle and hip angle changes, the more effective the starting movement.", "sections": [{"title": null, "content": "Speed skating, as one of the most historic competitive sports in the Winter Olympic Games, has consistently held a central position throughout the evolution of the Winter Olympics. Its competitive value carries strategic significance equivalent to that of fundamental events in the Summer Olympics, such as athletics and swimming. The primary objective of this discipline is to complete a predetermined course distance in the shortest possible time. In recent years, China has made remarkable progress in the field of short-track speed skating. However, with the continuous improvement of global speed skating performance, competition among elite athletes has become increasingly intense, with medalists' results differing by mere milliseconds [1]. A systematic review of the literature in speed skating research indicates that athletes' rapid start capability and acceleration performance during the initial phase of the race have a decisive impact on competition outcomes [2,3]. The starting technique, being a crucial winning factor in short-track speed skating [4], directly influences competition results through the precision of its technical details. Therefore, in-depth research into the key techniques of starting in short-track speed skating holds significant theoretical and practical importance.\nFrom a biomechanical perspective, the speed skating start technique refers to the complete technical process in which athletes assume a preparatory position and remain stationary upon receiving the \"Set\" command from the starter, until the gunshot triggers a rapid start and transition into the skating phase. This technical sequence can be systematically divided into three critical phases: preparatory position, start, and sprint, with the core objective of achieving an optimal transition from a stationary state to the individual's maximum skating speed [4]. The enhancement of starting speed primarily relies on stable support before the start and the coordinated rapid extension of body segments after initiation. Among these, the stability angle serves as a crucial indicator for assessing the stability of the athlete's starting posture, while the trunk angle and ice contact angle effectively reflect upper limb extension capability and forward propulsion. The hip, knee, and ankle joint angles directly characterize lower limb extension capacity, and the push-off angle can be used to evaluate the quality of ice contact support and push-off movements. Scientific start training and competitive practice require meticulous control of each preparatory movement, starting posture, initiation timing, as well as push-off and swing actions [5].\nThis study, based on an artificial intelligence-powered three-dimensional motion capture system, aims to identify the core factors influencing starting performance in short-track speed skaters through quantitative analysis of key body posture characteristics during the starting process. The findings are expected to provide scientific evidence and theoretical support for optimizing starting techniques."}, {"title": "1 Research Objectives and Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 Research Objectives", "content": "The research subjects consisted of 13 male short track speed skaters .

The phase after the start is further divided into the touch-down moment (TD) and the take-off moment (TO) [4, 6, 7], as shown in Figure 2. The time taken to reach 15 meters is a key indicator for measuring the effectiveness of the start, with a shorter time indicating better effectiveness [3, 8].

The results indicate that the athletes' starting stance exhibits technical features such as a significantly larger rear stability angle compared to the front stability angle, with the hip, knee, and ankle angles of the rear leg being greater than those of the front leg. Additionally, the trunk angle and the angle of the push-off against the ice are smaller, the stride length is greater than the stride width, and the center of gravity is lower.\nThe rear stability angle (r=0.355), front leg knee angle (r=0.618), rear leg knee angle (r=0.459), and stride length (r=0.515) show a moderate or high positive correlation with start speed, while the trunk angle (r=-0.585) exhibits a high negative correlation with start speed.

The results of this study indicate that, within a certain range, appropriately increasing the stride length, the knee angle of the left leg, and the posterior stability angle can enhance the starting speed. The stability of the starting posture is a prerequisite for ensuring an effective start and is also a critical factor determining the starting efficiency and sprint acceleration [9]. Due to the extremely low friction coefficient of the ice surface, speed skaters must start on ice while wearing skates with minimal contact area between the blade and the ice, resulting in poor stability of the support point and making it challenging to maintain a stable starting posture. Data analysis reveals that the anterior stability angle (6.89\u00b13.56\u00b0) of athletes is significantly smaller than the posterior stability angle (29.50\u00b13.66\u00b0), indicating that the starting posture places higher demands on posterior stability. Appropriately increasing the stride length and the knee angle of the left leg can"}, {"title": "3.2 The Effect of Forward Body Lean on Starting Performance", "content": "The forward-leaning posture is the foundation for maintaining dynamic support and sliding balance, preventing athletes from leaning backward due to the torque generated by forward force components. From an aerodynamic perspective, a smaller trunk angle helps reduce the frontal area, thereby decreasing air resistance. During the starting acceleration phase, an appropriate trunk angle is more conducive to energy output, with the benefits far outweighing the energy loss caused by air resistance. Moreover, the counter-torque generated by the body's center of gravity during sliding provides balance support for the athlete. This unique push-off and sliding pattern results in the athlete's body exhibiting continuous sinusoidal motion on the ice. During the sprint acceleration phase, athletes need to reduce the ice contact angle to shift the center of gravity forward, thereby increasing the moment in the sliding direction. The greater the forward lean, the more force is transmitted backward, analogous to the principle of striking an object with a hammer from a height. This phenomenon provides insights for land-based specialized training, emphasizing the need to strengthen lower limb muscle extension training in a forward-leaning posture. During the sprint, the magnitude and direction of the force exerted by the skate on the ice vary with changes in trunk angle, the trajectory of the center of gravity, sliding direction, and speed. Unlike the fixed support characteristics of sprinters, speed skating starting techniques feature \"dynamic support\" or \"sliding support.\" At the initial stage of the sprint, when the free-leg skate contacts the ice, the athlete's center of gravity is positioned in front of the contact foot, allowing smooth force application to the ice and minimizing braking force. However, if the center of gravity does not move past the skate's contact point in time, a \"braking\" effect will occur. Therefore, it is essential to establish a technical characteristic where the projection point of the center of gravity on the ice is located in front of the contact foot during the initial steps of the start."}, {"title": "3.3 The Influence of Lower Limb Joint Extension Ability on Starting Performance", "content": "Changes in lower limb joint angles significantly reflect the force characteristics and joint stiffness of the push-off leg [10, 11]. To generate force more effectively, athletes need to fully extend the push-off leg as much as possible. In short-distance events, the hip joint flexion-extension pattern plays a central role in the kinetic chain transmission during the starting phase. A larger extension range in a shorter time contributes to increased acceleration, representing the optimal external manifestation of starting performance. During the sprint acceleration phase after the start, a larger hip angle at the take-off moment is an indicator of good technical performance. During the start, the lower limb joint movement pattern of the rear support leg during the push-off phase is primarily related to extension. The kinetic chain transmission process rapidly propels the center of gravity from the proximal to the distal end through the extension of the rear support leg joints, reaching maximum speed at the moment of leaving the ice. The rear support leg achieves forward acceleration through rapid extension, and changes in lower limb joint angles directly reflect the effectiveness of the extension.\nAt the take-off moment during the start, the knee angle of the rear support leg is (150.34\u00b16.54)\u00b0, and the inability to fully extend may be related to the athlete's eagerness to increase movement frequency. Although rapid knee extension during the support phase can generate greater power [12, 13], the effectiveness of the rear support leg's push-off is more critical than high power output during the initial starting phase [4]. Additionally, the unique hinge structure of Clap skates makes it difficult for athletes to achieve full extension of the rear support leg during the start. Coupled with the extremely low friction coefficient of the ice and the absence of a starting block, athletes can only rely on the inner edge of the rear support leg skate to embed into the ice and resist body weight for force generation. The small support area and poor stability make excessive explosive force likely to cause side slipping or \"slip-out\" phenomena. Therefore, the effectiveness of the push-off leg's extension is more critical for improving starting efficiency.\nFrom the perspective of the human kinetic chain, the force for lower limb extension originates from the hip, with the kinetic chain transmission sequence being hip, knee, and ankle. If the hip and knee generate significant force while the ankle remains lax, it is difficult to obtain sufficient ice support reaction force. Furthermore, eversion of the push-off leg's ankle joint reduces starting efficiency. Therefore, strength training should focus on enhancing eversion control ability and rapid extension training with the ankle as the support, while integrating muscle contraction speed and movement amplitude to avoid functional strength imbalances and achieve the desired training effects."}, {"title": "3.4 The Influence of Ice Contact Support Ability and Push-Off Quality on Starting Performance", "content": "The rationality of the ice contact angle directly affects center of gravity transfer, push-off direction, and body stability, making it an important indicator of ice contact action quality [14]. As the race progresses and speed increases, the displacement of the athlete's body from the central axis gradually increases, and the sliding distance after the free-leg ice contact also extends, placing higher demands on the stability control ability of the skate's ice contact support. To maintain the sliding direction and ensure dynamic stability in a forward-leaning posture, the ankle plantar flexors and their associated muscle groups must possess strong extension control ability and firmly apply force to the inner edge of the skate. When the push-off leg is about to leave the ice, the Clap skate's heel automatically detaches from the boot, allowing full plantar flexion of the ankle and completing the push-off action. This places extremely high demands on the ankle's ability to control the skate. It is recommended that athletes perform land-based training in unstable conditions using sports shoes or skates, employing progressive training methods to enhance ankle strength and unstable support control ability, thereby improving \"ice feel.\" Additionally, during specialized starting strength training, single-leg support end-release training and dynamic center of gravity transfer training should be emphasized to improve the effective connection between starting phases and the efficiency of force transmission between limbs.\nThe size of the push-off angle significantly affects the trajectory of the athlete's center of gravity and the effectiveness of push-off force. From an anatomical perspective, an excessively large push-off angle increases the vertical force component, raising the height of the center of gravity at the take-off moment and negatively affecting forward momentum, which is detrimental to acceleration. Conversely, an excessively small push-off angle causes over-plantar flexion of the ankle, hindering the exertion of push-off force [15]. Although a smaller push-off angle increases the forward force component, the reduction in vertical force may lead to premature ice contact of the free leg, also affecting speed. Multiple studies have shown that the push-off angle is a key indicator determining push-off effectiveness [4, 10,16]. Minimizing the push-off angle during the early phase of the push-off leg's extension is beneficial for the vectorial exertion of horizontal force [17]. Applying \"effective\" force within the optimal push-off angle range is crucial for improving starting speed. During the sprint acceleration phase, the push-off force of the free-leg skate's ice contact support is characterized by instant acceleration and explosive knee extension. Therefore, training should focus on enhancing lower limb extension explosive power, particularly single-leg explosive power."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "The starting preparatory posture places higher demands on the athlete's posterior stability. Appropriately increasing the posterior stability angle, knee angles of both legs, and stride length can enhance starting speed. During the starting and sprint phases, appropriately reducing the ice contact angle and push-off angle for each step while increasing the trunk angle and the range of hip angle changes at the take-off moment can improve starting efficiency. When optimizing starting posture training, it is necessary to appropriately reduce the trunk angle, increase stride length, forward shift of the center of gravity, and knee angle to better control starting stability and provide conditions for the rear push-off leg's force exertion. The training focus during the starting and sprint acceleration phases should be on strengthening lower limb joint angle control, minimizing the ice contact angle to avoid buffering effects, reducing the push-off angle to enhance effective push-off force, and reinforcing the ankle's \"rigid support\" function and the explosive power of the left leg."}]}

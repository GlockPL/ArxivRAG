The present work surveys BLE-5 tags as practical tools for tracking mailed item. These devices rely on dense networks of smartphones for location updates, offering a decentralized passive sensor and energy-efficient tracking solution that contrasts sharply with traditional technologies like GPS or inertial measurement units (IMUs). BLE-5 is a wireless communication protocol designed for low-power, short-range data transmission. It represents a significant advancement over earlier Bluetooth standards, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, data transmission rates, and range. BLE 5 supports a range of up to 240 meters in ideal conditions and offers data rates of up to 2 Mbps. These tracking antennae make it highly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where devices like AirTags need to operate over extended periods with minimal energy consumption.\nThese use cases underscore the transformative potential of AirTags beyond their intended purpose while also illuminating critical challenges around privacy, security, and ethical use."}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "The study used a set of 15 AirTags, each paired initially with an iPhone running iOS 18.1.1, to evaluate the capabilities of BLE 5 trackers in logistical scenarios. The AirTags [34] were monitored and logged automatically using Apple's Find My application on a MacBook Pro (2011) running macOS Monterey, leveraging its ability to generate unencrypted JSON logs for analysis. These logs, contained within the cached items.data file, provided rich metadata about each tracker, including location details, device attributes, and battery status. The main challenges here involved acquiring the right macOS version, then automating the posting of every location change to a Google Drive folder while converting the raw device files to an aggregated Keyhole Markup Language (KML) layer for geographic display on 3D globes.\nTo distinguish between the devices, all tags took on the name of an historical or fictional explorer. The Find My app served as the primary interface for monitoring the trackers in real time, displaying their positional data and metadata. The unencrypted items.data file produced by the app captured key parameters such as geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude), floor level, and the accuracy of these measurements, along with temporal data like timestamps for each location update. After nearly 20,000 location updates, the mean frequency per device is 6.5 per hour and 117 for the network of 19 tracked items or devices studied. As shown in Figures 2-3, the distribution varies considerably by device name, type, and day depending on the surrounding UWB relay environment. For instance, the update frequency will vary by background traffic particularly for moving devices and by overall location. The stationary MacBook registers the highest update frequency as one might expect, followed by the registration iPhone (moving) and the disseminated AirTag trackers.\nAdditional device-specific fields, including battery level, operational status, and model information, were also logged, offering comprehensive insights into the trackers' operational status during deployment. AirTags continuously broadcast encrypted identifiers (payloads) via BLE. These payloads include no personally identifiable information but serve as unique identifiers for the device. When a compatible Apple device\u2014such as an iPhone, iPad, or Mac\u2014comes into proximity of an AirTag, it captures the BLE signal and relays the encrypted identifier along with its own GPS coordinates to Apple's Find My servers. This process is entirely anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, ensuring privacy for the AirTag owner and the relay device's user.\nThe spatial data collected allowed the study to evaluate the AirTags' performance in tracking and logistical workflows, particularly their ability to provide accurate and timely updates in a simulated mailing network. By parsing the unencrypted JSON data, the study not only validated the reliability of BLE 5 trackers in dynamic environments but also uncovered their limitations, such as potential discrepancies in altitude or positional accuracy when navigating complex spatial environments like multistory buildings. The combination of real-time monitoring through the Find My app and retrospective analysis of the items.data file created an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of BLE-based tracking in logistical systems."}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "Last Mile Problem. In spoke and hub models, the logistics of sending items to closely spaced spoke mailboxes add considerable travel, fuel, and time delay when all sorting happens at a distant hub. This network models shares features with traditional the last-mile problem. The last mile, as defined in supply chain management, refers to the final segment of delivery from a transport hub to the recipient's destination. This stage is often the most complex and resource-intensive part of the delivery process, especially in disrupted or underserved areas where infrastructure may be damaged or inadequate. BLE trackers have the potential to serve as \"last mile probes,\" providing real-time insights into the dynamics of this critical stage and helping optimize service delivery in challenging environments.\nReverse logistics, an often-overlooked aspect of last-mile delivery, was also explored by tracking the return-to-sender processes for undeliverable packages. AirTags embedded in these packages provided visibility into the efficiency and timeliness of returns, offering insights into how mobile postal units can better manage reverse logistics during disaster recovery operations. The integration of AirTag data with geographic visualization tools, such as Google Maps, allowed for the creation of detailed route maps, highlighting inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the delivery network.\nThe optimization of hub-and-spoke networks presents a complex interplay between spatial configuration and operational dynamics. The system's total cost function captures three critical components:\n$C(d_s,d_h,\\lambda) = \\alpha \\cdot C_{travel}(d_s, d_h,\\lambda) + \\beta \\cdot C_{time}(d_s,d_h,\\lambda) + \\gamma \\cdot C_{congestion}(d_h,\\lambda)$\nwhere:\n$C_{travel}$ represents distance-based costs proportional to $(2d_h + d_s)$\n$C_{time}$ captures delays from both travel and processing\n$C_{congestion}$ models non-linear queuing effects as $\\lambda$ approaches hub capacity $\\mu$\nDiscrete Event Simulation (DES) is particularly well-suited for analyzing this system due to several key characteristics [35]. First, the queuing dynamics at the hub exhibit complex behavior that resists closed-form analytical solutions, especially when arrival rates approach capacity limits. Second, the interaction between spatial distance and demand follows an inverse square relationship (\u03bb \u221d 1/d\u00b2), creating non-linear effects that are best understood through simulation. Finally, the system's response to perturbations in arrival rates and processing times creates temporal dynamics that are difficult to capture in static optimization models.\nThe DES approach enables exploration of critical pinch points in the network where operational constraints meet service demands. By modeling mail generation as a Poisson process and implementing realistic queue management at the hub, the simulation reveals how congestion effects propagate through the system. This understanding is crucial for identifying optimal hub-spoke distances that balance centralization benefits against increasing travel costs and diminishing interaction demand over distance.\nThe key insight from this theoretical framework is that hub-spoke networks exhibit a saddle point in their cost function: at small spoke distances ds, the hub becomes inefficient due to excessive detours, while at large distances, interaction demand a drops too low to justify centralization. Finding this optimal configuration through simulation provides practical guidance for logistics network design while accounting for the stochastic nature of real-world operations."}, {"title": "", "content": "The discrete event simulation highlights critical inefficiencies in traditional hub-and-spoke logistics systems, particularly when two spokes are closely spaced (Figure 4). In the simulated scenario, all mail between two nearby spokes, Alpha and Beta, was routed through a centralized hub located 50 miles away. This hub dependency led to significant delays as mail had to travel an unnecessary detour of nearly 100 miles, despite the spokes being only 5 miles apart. The inefficiency of this routing system becomes apparent when considering the compounded travel times and processing delays that occur at the hub.\nThe simulation revealed that closely spaced spokes exacerbate the inherent limitations of hub-and-spoke systems. While the central hub is effective for aggregating and redistributing mail over long distances, it is a poor fit for localized delivery needs between spokes in proximity. The forced reliance on the hub introduced avoidable delays, as vehicles prioritized the hub's queue rather than addressing the short and direct routes between Alpha and Beta. This bottleneck effect became more pronounced during peak times, when incoming mail at the hub exceeded the processing and vehicle capacity.\nTemporal patterns in the simulation illustrated additional inefficiencies, as mail often arrived at the hub faster than it could be dispatched to its destination. This queuing problem delayed deliveries further, with mail from Alpha to Beta spending unnecessary time waiting for available transport, despite the short geographic distance between the two. For time-sensitive deliveries, such delays would be particularly costly, as they could result in missed deadlines or reduced customer satisfaction.\nThe findings suggest that a centralized hub approach is fundamentally misaligned with the dynamics of localized delivery between nearby spokes. The model demonstrates the potential benefits of introducing direct spoke-to-spoke routing, which could significantly reduce travel distances and delivery times. Such routing would bypass the hub entirely for Alpha-Beta exchanges, allowing for more efficient mail flow and less dependency on the hub's processing capabilities. Additionally, decentralizing operations by establishing mini-hubs closer to spoke clusters could mitigate the detour effect and reduce overall delays.\nBy illustrating the inefficiencies of hub-dominated logistics in last-mile delivery scenarios, the simulation in Figure 5 emphasizes the importance of adaptive routing strategies. Combining centralized and decentralized methods based on the geographic relationship between spokes and the hub could optimize system performance, particularly for high-frequency routes between closely spaced locations. The results demonstrate that while hub-and-spoke systems offer scalability for long-distance logistics, their rigidity limits their effectiveness in localized, dynamic delivery networks. This insight is crucial for designing more flexible systems that account for the specific spatial and temporal challenges of the last mile."}, {"title": "Hurricane Helene and western North Carolina relief (2024)", "content": "In the context of Hurricane Helene, where western North Carolina faced extensive road blockages and community displacement, AirTags could provide granular data on the movement of relief supplies through temporary postal services. For example (Figure 6), mobile units stationed at pop-up distribution hubs or traveling between evacuation centers could be equipped with BLE trackers to monitor their location and efficiency in real-time. This data could then be fed into centralized logistics systems, enabling disaster response teams to dynamically allocate resources, reroute supplies around inaccessible areas, and ensure that critical deliveries reach high-need locations. Like real-time trackers from the state emergency management system, the postal tags provide route information and identify bottlenecks and pinch points. An overlay of road closures and power outages support the logistics network with road CCTV and updated maps of flooded areas, shelters, evacuation routes, fuel, and emergency staging areas. The study hypothesized that AirTags would provide consistent and accurate location data, even in challenging environments where traditional GPS systems often fail. Their reliance on the dense Find My network, which utilizes proximity to smartphones rather than satellite signals, was expected to ensure reliable updates in urban canyons, dense forests, or temporary shelters where GPS may be obstructed. Furthermore, the data was analyzed to identify delays and deviations in delivery routes caused by infrastructure disruptions. For instance, packages encountering detours or delays at flooded roads were tracked in real time, allowing for dynamic rerouting decisions and resource reallocation."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "The Find My network offers distinct advantages for reverse logistics compared to traditional tracking methods, particularly in scenarios where efficiency, cost, and adaptability are critical. Unlike dedicated GPS-based systems, which require consistent satellite connectivity and often involve high operational costs, Find My relies on the vast network of Apple devices to relay location data. This crowdsourced architecture enables the tracking of items without the need for direct GPS integration, making AirTags a lightweight and cost-effective alternative for monitoring reverse logistics.\nIn reverse logistics scenarios, such as return-to-sender processes or undeliverable packages, AirTags provide robust tracking capabilities by leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to send location updates through nearby Apple devices. This approach is particularly effective in urban and suburban environments, where device density ensures frequent updates. By contrast, GPS-based trackers may outperform AirTags in sparsely populated or rural areas with limited Apple device penetration, as the Find My network's reliance on proximity introduces potential gaps in coverage. However, GPS systems are more power-intensive and less practical for widespread deployment in cost-sensitive logistics operations.\nThe results indicate that while AirTags excel in tracking the movement of items through complex urban routing, their performance is influenced by the density of the surrounding Apple ecosystem. Reverse logistics operations benefit from AirTags' ability to identify bottlenecks and delays at specific distribution hubs, as shown by consistent location updates in high-density areas. However, in low-density zones, the lack of proximate Apple devices can result in delayed updates, highlighting a tradeoff between affordability and real-time precision.\nIn terms of flexibility, the Find My network allows for seamless integration into existing workflows without the need for proprietary infrastructure, unlike many GPS-based systems that require specialized hardware or software. While both systems have unique strengths, AirTags and the Find My network stand out as a scalable, energy-efficient option for reverse logistics in environments where device density and cost constraints are prioritized over precision and continuous updates. It is worth noting that significant portions of the world's population reside in regions with varying degrees of GPS and satellite technology restrictions, encompassing approximately 22% of global landmass and 43% of the world's population. This includes major nations such as China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, and others, where GPS technology faces regulatory hurdles ranging from registration requirements to outright bans. In this context, Bluetooth-based tracking technologies like AirTags present an alternative tracking solution that operates independently of GPS infrastructure. These devices leverage crowd-sourced networks of consumer devices to provide location data, potentially circumventing satellite-based restrictions while still enabling basic location tracking capabilities.\nA significant limitation encountered during the research was the integration of encryption in Apple's Find My network, which affects the accessibility of raw data from AirTags. AirTags leverage advanced encryption to ensure user privacy and data security, making it difficult to directly access their internal location metadata or transmission details. However, this limitation was circumvented by employing a legacy MacBook Pro (2011 model) running macOS Monterey, a system version that allowed access to unencrypted logs from the Find My application. macOS Monterey, released on October 25, 2021, introduced substantial features and compatibility enhancements for Macs produced in 2015 or later, yet its support for legacy systems was invaluable for this study. The MacBook provided an environment where the items.data JSON logs could be accessed without encryption, enabling the analysis of AirTag metadata, including location, battery status, and positional accuracy. This workaround highlighted the potential barriers researchers face when modern security protocols obscure device telemetry, posing challenges for detailed experimental setups.\nIn contrast to Apple's AirTags, Samsung SmartTags operate on a more traditional Bluetooth framework and lack a similarly extensive network backbone to pivot signals when the primary user is out of range. SmartTags rely on direct connections to the owner's device or other Samsung Galaxy devices within the SmartThings ecosystem. While effective in close-range scenarios, this architecture significantly limits their utility in large-scale or geographically distributed tracking operations. The absence of a global crowdsourced network like Apple's \"Find My\u201d reduces the range and frequency of updates, making SmartTags less suitable for scenarios requiring continuous location monitoring or dynamic routing adjustments. For instance, if a SmartTag moves out of range of nearby compatible devices, its location cannot be updated until it re-enters a networked area, creating potential blind spots in tracking.\nThe comparison underscores the unique advantages of Apple's Find My network, which mitigates such gaps by using the extensive base of Apple devices as signal relays. While SmartTags offer a simpler, more direct Bluetooth tracking system, their reliance on the narrower Samsung ecosystem restricts their effectiveness for applications like reverse logistics or disaster relief, where wide coverage and decentralized signal propagation are critical. This difference highlights the importance of network architecture in determining the scalability and reliability of BLE-based tracking systems."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "This research explored the dynamics of last-mile delivery in hub-and-spoke logistics systems using BLE trackers such as Apple AirTags to simulate mailing scenarios.

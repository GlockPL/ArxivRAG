{"title": "LATEXAI Adoption to Combat Financial Crime: Study on Natural\nLanguage Processing in Adverse Media Screening of Financial Services in\nEnglish and Bangla multilingual interpretation", "authors": ["Soumita Roy"], "abstract": "This document explores the potential of employing Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), to strengthen the detection and prevention of financial crimes within the\nMobile Financial Services(MFS) of Bangladesh with multilingual scenario. The analysis focuses on\nthe utilization of NLP for adverse media screening, a vital aspect of compliance with anti-money\nlaundering (AML) and combating financial terrorism (CFT) regulations. Additionally, it investigates\nthe overall reception and obstacles related to the integration of AI in Bangladeshi banks. This report\nmeasures the effectiveness of NLP is promising with an accuracy around 94%. NLP algorithms\ndisplay substantial promise in accurately identifying adverse media content linked to financial crimes.\nThe lack of progress in this aspect is visible in Bangladesh, whereas globally the technology is\nalready being used to increase effectiveness and efficiency. Hence, it is clear there is an issue with\nthe acceptance of AI in Bangladesh. Some AML & CFT concerns are already being addressed by AI\ntechnology. For example, Image Recognition OCR technology are being used in KYC procedures.\nPrimary hindrances to AI integration involve a lack of technical expertise, high expenses, and\nuncertainties surrounding regulations. This investigation underscores the potential of AI-driven NLP\nsolutions in fortifying efforts to prevent financial crimes in Bangladesh.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The report is based on the work experience acquired at an MFS. Adverse Media Screening is one of the scopes\nwhere AI can have a significant impact on preventing financial crimes. This process involves identifying negative\ninformation related to individuals or entities, such as news articles, court records, or social media posts, that could\nindicate potential involvement in illicit activities. Conventional methods of adverse media screening are often\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive. AI, particularly NLP, can automate this process, making it more efficient and\neffective. One key analysis as part of NLP, Sentiment analysis, particularly is being researched for identifying\nnegative information related to anti money laundering concerns (Han et al. 2020).\nThe various technologies are being used for AML and CFT (Combating Financial Terrorism) concerns as noted\nby researchers from the armed forces of other countries (T.H. Helmy et al., 2014). So, it is clear technology,\nfinance and compliance concerns can come together to create solutions for this issue.\nSentiment analysis particularly has shown an accuracy rate of 76.96% for the research on 12,467 financial articles\nclassifying (Han et al. 2020). That means accuracy of the contents are likely to be red flagged and predicted by the\nAI model for financially risky transactions.\nA comprehensive research on the NLP uses of sentiment analysis notes use cases and researches for Product\nAnalysis, Market Research, Competitor Analysis, Reputation Management, Business Intelligence, Health Care,\nReview Analysis, Experience Analysis, Sentiments of Customer Reviews, Aspect Analysis, Stock Market, Stock"}, {"title": "2. Method", "content": "This research has used methods for the NLP effectiveness in sentiment measures of the positive, negative and\nneutral connotation of the data. Tools used include PyCharm, Open AI Large language Model, and Python library.\nRaw data is collected from data sources, which is dependent upon data sources.\nThe use of classification confusion matrix method for predicting AML transactions' risk accuracy, precision,\nrecall and f1 score has been researched for the case of AML (M. Alkhalili et al. 2021). Below is the formula for\nquantifying accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.\nAccuracy = (TP+TN) /(TP+FP+TN+FN)\nPrecision = TP /(TP+FP)\nRecall = TP /(TP+FN)\nF1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\nGiven that,\nTP = True Positive (Correctly identified positive instances)\nTN= True Negative(Correctly identified negative instances)\nFP = False Positive(Incorrectly identified positive instances)\nFN= False Negative(Incorrectly identified negative instances)\nTP, FP, TN, and FN are used to calculate Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Accuracy:\n\u2022 Precision emphasizes how many of the positive predictions were accurate (pertaining to TP and FP).\n\u2022 Recall assesses how effectively the model identifies all genuine positive cases (pertaining to TP and FN).\n\u2022 F1 Score merges precision and recall to provide a balanced evaluation.\n\u2022 Accuracy is a very simple and widely used measure to benchmark many AI models and tools. It is all the\naccurate prediction outcomes divided by all the data.\n\u2022 Weighted measures of this calculation are based on the data sets weights of positive, neutral and negative\ndata.\nAccuracy, Precision, recall, and the F1 score are metrics utilized as an evaluation measure of performance of\nclassification models, particularly in situations where class imbalance exists or when there's an emphasis on\nparticular types of errors."}, {"title": "2.2 SOURCES OF DATA AND SAMPLING", "content": "Research population data sources are in social media and news, as this is where adverse media or negative media\ncan be found. This research samples the data from mainly facebook, as it is widely used for money laundering and\nfinancial crimes, and news articles are not from specific news companies rather from all the digital news articles\npublished during the sampling time discussed later in the report. Sample size is 5376 text sentences and fragments\nfrom the sources mentioned. Data was collected over the first week of September. So, the time frame includes a\nweek's news from the media related to MFS."}, {"title": "3. Experiment", "content": "Data collection was automatedly collected by using Data scraping. Data cleaning was also taken into account,\nwhich was to prepare the data into text formatting and removing unnecessary metadata, images and their title.\nAfterwards some of the data had to be manually labeled if they are positive, neutral or negative. Since the data was\nlabeled data we could evaluate the models in supervised learning to utilize classification analysis evaluating the\naccuracy, precision, and recall.\nTraining data splitting:\nResearch also suggests 2/3 data splitting ratio of training to testing had better outcomes than 1/3 data splitting\n(Dobbin, K. K., & Simon, R. M., 2011). This testing has roughly the following data splitting.\n\u2022 Training Documents Percentage: 64.22%\n\u2022 Testing Documents Percentage: 35.78%\nThe limited training on the 5376 text sentences/fragments from various sources including Social Media, facebook,\nand news media of a week. Central tendency is observed in the data. Data is kept in sentence/fragment, as\nexamining individual sentences proves to be more useful since a document can include both positive and negative\nremarks (Wankhade et al., 2022)."}, {"title": "4.

Without proper risk mitigation of using AI, it is not possible to implement it without human\nintervention.\nCompliance needs to be more efficient and effective to safeguard both customers and the financial institutions.

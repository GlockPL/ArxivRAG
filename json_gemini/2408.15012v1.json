Large amounts of transactional data in auditing can be represented as transactions between financial accounts using weighted bipartite graphs.

We use Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent agendas showing different interest in different set of financial accounts. We also model some possible deliberation scenarios between agents with different interrogative agendas to reach an aggregated agenda and categorization. The framework developed in this paper provides a formal ground to obtain and study explainable categorizations from the data represented as bipartite graphs according to the agendas of different agents in an organization (e.g. an audit firm), and interaction between these through deliberation.

Auditors collect, weigh, and combine information in formulating their judgment about the truth/fairness of their clients' financial statements. A financial audit is broken up into components, corresponding to e.g. legal entities, branches, departments, as well as separate business cycles (e.g. order-to-cash, procure-to-pay,), their related balance sheet and income statement accounts, and the company's assertions about these accounts (e.g. their completeness, existence, accuracy, valuation). To collect evidence pertaining to each assertion, auditors choose a mixture of procedures, e.g. risk assessment, the testing of effectiveness of internal controls, statistical and non-statistical sampling. Procedures may be geared to all aggregation levels, ranging from the entity as a whole to a specific assertion of a specific part of a financial statement account. The objective of the auditor then is to aggregate all evidence obtained to issue an opinion as to whether the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the company. As precise guidelines for information collection, and evaluation in auditing do not exist, individual and collective professional judgment plays a key and pervasive role in auditing [27]."}, {"title": "Data analytic techniques in auditing", "content": "Text-analysis techniques, AI and data-analytic methods have already been very useful to speed up the controlling function of auditors by flagging low-level, individual anomalies [29, 44, 38, 58, 57]. However, even in the absence of low-level anomalies, it is an auditor's task to detect higher-level anomalies concerning the coherence of all information at different aggregation levels: indeed, one and the same event or action in the life of a company is witnessed as evidence at multiple levels (e.g. at the overall financial statement level, at the account level, at the transactions stream level, and at the individual assertion level of accounts). Also, certain items of evidence pertain to multiple assertions of an account. For example, confirmation of accounts receivables pertains to the \u201cExistence\" and \"Valuation\" assertions of the account receivable balance."}, {"title": "Challenges", "content": "The extant research on the formal foundations of the reasoning at the core of auditing [48, 54, 52, 53, 35] has highlighted several inadequacies of probability theory for representing uncertainty in audit judgments, the most prominent of which are the logical implications stemming from the complementarity of probabilities, and the ensuing difficulty in drawing the key distinction between the absence of evidence in support of a statement and the presence of evidence to its contrary. This literature has advocated the use of Dempster-Shafer theory [14, 47] to overcome this problem. However, the extant literature has not yet developed specific formal models for audit on which machine learning algorithms can be designed and tested. This paper tries to provide a Dempster-Shafer based formal framework which can be used by machine learning algorithms to detect both low-level and high-level anomalies."}, {"title": "Aims and contributions", "content": "The present paper develops formal models specifically designed to analyse and rep- resent the higher-level processing of information of experienced auditors, and at using this formal understanding to develop machine learning tools to flag higher-level anomalies. Specifically, we posit that the experienced au- ditors' evaluation of evidence is rooted in a process of category-formation, by which pieces of evidence are clustered together in categories which are possibly very different from the \"official\" categories with which the evidence is presented in the self-reported financial statement of the given firm. These categories provide the context of evaluation in which different and possibly very heterogeneous pieces of evidence are compared with/against each other, and their overall coherence is evaluated. Here we use tools from Formal Concept Analysis, modal logic, and Dempster-Shafer theory to create a framework for creating and analyzing such cate- gorizations and then show how the framework can be used to obtain interpretable machine learning algorithms for outlier detection and classification allowing for easier interaction of algorithms with human experts."}, {"title": "Background theory", "content": "The formal framework presented in this paper is set within many-valued Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) [59, 3], in which (vague) categories are represented as the formal concepts associated with bipartite weighted graphs seen as fuzzy formal contexts [59, 3], each consisting of domains A (of objects) and X (of features), and a weighted relation I between them. One particularly relevant example for the present paper concerns clustering of nodes of a bipartite graph which represents the network of financial transactions (i.e. a financial statements network) [7].\nMathematically, bipartite graphs and formal contexts are isomorphic structures; moreover, both types of structures are used to represent data [59, 50, 30, 39, 23, 45, 62, 9]. Regarding bipartite graphs as formal contexts allows for access to the well-known representation of the hierarchy of formal concepts associated with each formal context [4], and hence provides a formally explicit categorization process.

A business process is the set of credit and debit activities meant to produce a specific output [7], e.g. all the transactions relating to a sale of an object. A collection of records in any journal entry data can be mapped to a particular business process. Any business process a can then be described in terms of the values of I(a, x) for any x \u2208 X. This description yields a categorization of business processes which can be of interest in auditing [7, 5]. To make processing and interpreting contexts easier, many-valued formal contexts G = (A, X, I) as above may be converted into two-valued formal contexts using conceptual scaling [20]."}, {"title": "Interrogative agendas", "content": "As mentioned above, the final outcome of the auditing process is the formation of a qualitative opinion, by expert auditors, on the fairness and completeness of a given firm's financial accounts. Towards the formation of their opinion, not all features have the same weight in the eyes of the auditors: indeed, different auditors may have different views about which parts of the financial accounts they consider more relevant to the formation of their opinion. If a certain set of features has significantly more relevance to an agent (auditor), we can model this situation by letting this set of features to be the agenda of that agent. In many cases, the agenda of an agent may not be realistically approximated in such a simple way, but might consist of different relevance or importance values assigned to the different set of features. We will use Dempster-Shafer mass functions to represent such agendas.\nAnother reason why features do not have the same weight or importance to an auditor is because different departments or groups of transactions may have different perceived degree of risk leading an auditor to assign different importance to different financial accounts involved.\nSimilarly to the different epistemic attitudes entertained by experts auditors, also different procedures used in auditing may focus unequally on different features (financial accounts). Categorizations of business processes based on different features may be useful in analyzing effectiveness of different methods for different business processes. This may also be helpful in categorization of errors obtained from such methods, a topic of significant interest in auditing [22, 49]. In the proposed framework, the different epistemic attitudes of expert auditors are formalized by the notion of interrogative agenda [17]. This framework can also be used to provide a better understanding of source and extent of concerns, and in making decision about which additional data may be needed in decision-making."}, {"title": "A formal framework", "content": "We introduce a formal framework specifically designed to systematically represent and reason about the different ways business processes can be categorized on the basis of different agendas of the different agents (expert auditors), as well as the possible aggregations of these categorizations, by means of a deliberation process.

Such priorities can be represented as Dempster-Shafer mass functions on the set of features. These mass functions also induce mass functions on different categorical hierarchies, and represent priorities for each categorization based on these agendas. Dempster-Shafer theory has been applied to model reasoning under uncertainty about categorization of objects and features, or for describ- ing preferences for certain categories in a given categorization [18]. In the same work, a Dempster-Shafer mass function is defined over a given concept lattice representing evidence for a set of objects or features belonging to a category or preference in that category. Here, we take a different approach, and use Dempster-Shafer theory to describe the priority or importance of different set of features in categorization using Dempster-Shafer mass functions. That is, mass functions are used to choose which categorization is most suitable for a given task. We then try to formalize deliberation between the agents with different agendas represented by mass functions using aggregation rules in Dempster-Shafer theory."}, {"title": "2 Example", "content": "In this section, we informally illustrate the ideas discussed in the introduction by way of an example.

Only the information the agent considers relevant is actually absorbed (or acted upon) by the agent and used e.g. in their decision-making, in the formation of their beliefs, etc. Interrogative agendas can be organized in hierarchies, and this hierarchical structure serves to establish whether a given interrogative agenda subsumes another, and define different notions of \"common ground\" among agendas. Deliberation and negotiation processes can be understood in terms of whether and how decision-makers/negotiators succeed in modifying their own interrogative agendas or those of their coun- terparts, and the outcomes of these processes can be described in terms of the \"common ground\" agenda thus reached.

Suppose different agents have mass functions describing their interest or preference in different set of issues i.e. for agent j we have a mass function m\u2c7c: P(X) \u2192 [0, 1] where for any Y \u2286 X, m\u2c7c(Y) denotes preference of agent to use set of features (agenda) Y as a criterion for categorization. This mass function can be seen as a Dempster-Shafer mass function on the set P(X). A particular cases of interest from a practical point of view are when m\u2c7c is simple mass function.\nDefinition 10. For any Dempster-Shafer mass function m : P(S) \u2192 [0, 1] a set Y \u2286 S is said to be focal set of m if m(Y) > 0. A Dempster-Shafer mass function m : P(S) \u2192 [0, 1] is said to be simple iff it has at most one focal set X \u2286 S.\nSuppose that an agent j mentions that she considers a set of features Y \u2286 X to be of high importance (given by a \u2208 [0, 1]) for categorization. In this case, the agenda of agent j may be represented by a simple mass function m\u2c7c(Y) = a and m\u2c7c(X) = 1 \u2212 a. Here, we do not have any information about how j intends to distribute importance (or preference) 1 \u2212 a between different features for categorization. Thus, we assign this mass to the set X to denote non-availability of information regarding its distribution.\nExample 11. Suppose an agent j assigns different importance to each feature individually. In this case the mass function representing agenda of j is given by a simple mass function m\u2c7c : P(X) \u2192 [0, 1], for any Y \u2286 X,\n$$m_j(Y) = \\sum_{y \\in Y} v(x),$$\nwhere v(x) is the (normalized) importance value assigned by agent j to x."}, {"title": "Definition 12.", "content": "Let P = (A, X, I) be the formal context under consideration and let R be the set of induced formal contexts.

Introduction", "content": "According to the World Population Prospects 2022, the older adult population of the world is growing rapidly [112]. The percentage of the global population aged 65 and above is estimated to increase from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050 [113]. Ageing significantly impacts individual health, leading to crucial challenges of physical impairment and mental decline. Aged care, encompassing support services for older individuals' health and well-being, addresses these challenges and rising needs, while accommodating the diverse physical, emotional, and social aspects of individuals [114, 115].\nA growing body of literature recognises the importance of software solutions for healthcare problems, including cancer support [116], intensive care monitoring [117], and chronic disease tracking [118]. As aged care needs can be viewed as a combination of several healthcare problems, applying software solutions can address this urgent demand. For example, personalized home care can improve the overall quality of care and enhance the well-being of older individuals with fragility and cognitive decline. Software Engineering for ageing users' digital health software has become a popular area of research and practice. These tend to focus on improving the quality of care for older adults in home or aged care healthcare settings, including adapting to the changing needs of older adults, developing various ageing user Mobile Health (mHealth) applications, smart home, care solutions, and conducting diverse usability testing with older adults.\nRequirements engineering (RE) is a critical part of software engineering. This involves obtaining, analysing, recording, implementing, and updating software requirements. In the development of digital health software for older adults, RE can play a crucial role in ensuring that the software is user-centred, accessible, secure, and relevant to the needs of ageing end users and their caregivers [115]. RE is particularly important in medical, health, and welfare software engineering for older end users as they have varying levels of comfort with modern technology, diverse living situations, and diverse physical and mental impacts of ageing.\nWhile several studies have applied RE for their older user-targeted digital health applications, a system-atic review has not yet been conducted to identify the key strategies and requirements of diverse software that are developed for ageing users. Several RE frameworks for aged care software solutions have been proposed; however, the analysis of these frameworks remains inadequate to enhance the field's common agreement and mutual learning. Therefore, conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on requirements engineering for aged care is necessary to ensure that digital health software for older adults meets the specific needs of older adults and is designed to be accessible, secure, and compliant with regulations. The main contributions of this SLR are to 1) highlight the key works that have used RE in older adult digital health; 2) explore how the RE is done in each study; and 3) point out the key benefits, limitations, and recommendations of RE in each study. In our SLR we analyzed 69 studies that were found by filtering studies from eight databases. Our results reveal that the usage and adoption of requirements in older adult digital health software vary by quality and conditions, which is related to the RE techniques used, requirement modelling, and in which stage RE was involved during system building.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background and related work. Section 3 presents the review protocol, details about the conduction, and results reporting. Section 4 discusses the advances"}, {"title": "2.

This endeavour can ultimately lead to a more successful app that improves the health and well-being of older adults with chronic conditions."}, {"title": "2.1. Requirements Engineering", "content": "Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing quality software systems [119]. Key RE-related include identifying stakeholders, eliciting and analyzing requirements, and documenting them for developers. Common RE models include user personas [120], user stories [121], use cases [121], and various semantic models [122]. They help to clarify and specify requirements in a way that is more precise and unambiguous, involving ontology models, conceptual models, and even Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Heyn et. al has mentioned that using RE conceptual models can improve contextual definitions, data attributes, performance definition and monitoring, and the impact of human factors on system acceptance and success [123]. Nazir et al. and Ahmed et al. have verified that NLP-based and Large Language Model (LLM)s requirements engineering can greatly reduce the amount of rework and improve qualities of the system[124, 125].\nIn this review, due to the terms used in many studies being diverse, we also take into account the studies that applied user goal modelling, co-design, participatory design process, and user-centred approach, as long as there is a significant RE aspect described in the studies. User Needs Assessment identifies and prioritizes the needs and preferences of users [126, 127, 128]. Differing from RE, user needs assessment may focus more on understanding user preferences and behaviours rather than specific software requirements. User Goal Modelling defines the specific aims that users want to achieve with a software system. Co-Design is a collaborative design approach that involves users, designers, and other stakeholders working together to design solutions and actively involves users in the design process. Participatory design involves users in the design process, allowing them to contribute ideas, feedback, and suggestions. It encompasses various design activities beyond requirements elicitation, such as prototyping, usability testing, and iterative design. User-centred Approaches are an overarching philosophy that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and capabilities of users throughout the design and development process."}, {"title": "2.2. Digital Health Softwares for Ageing Users", "content": "Digital health, or eHealth, involves using information and communication technologies to enhance health-care delivery [129, 130, 131]. It includes electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, mHealth apps, wearable devices, and health information systems, enabling better communication among healthcare profes-sionals, remote patient monitoring, and empowering individuals with real-time health data. Digital health benefits patients, caregivers, and society by improving outcomes, decision-making, and resource allocation. Many digital health technologies have been used in the field of older adult health care, such as remote monitoring and telehealth, medication management, fall detection and prevention, cognitive health, and social connectedness. A systematic review has analysed such work with a special focus on smart homes for older adults [132]. These solutions can improve the quality of life for older adults, and the review study highlights the potential of smart home technologies to enhance their quality of life. Another study about IoT-based systems and applications designed for aged care digital health examined the key technologies used, their applications in healthcare settings, and their impact on the quality of care for senior individuals [133]. They found that IoT-based systems have the potential to significantly improve senior healthcare by enabling remote monitoring, personalized care, and early diagnosis of diseases."}, {"title": "2.3.

Reviews on RE and Digital Health Softwares for Ageing People", "content": "acceptance and success. Due to users and carers particular demographics and needs, RE is crucial for en-suring good digital health software for older adults. Previous research on RE in healthcare highlights the challenges and best practices for gathering, analysing, and managing requirements for healthcare systems [134]. They emphasize the importance of RE in ensuring the successful development and deployment of healthcare systems that meet the needs of stakeholders. A Systematic literature review on RE underscores the importance of human-centred design in digital health [135]. In this work, they present a RE perspective to sustain health, discussing the challenges and opportunities for applying RE principles to address health-related issues. They suggest that RE is vital for developing sustainable health solutions aligned with user needs and preferences.\nGood requirements elicitation is crucial in digital health [136, 137]. Several researchers have explored the status of requirement-gathering activities in the co-design or participatory design processes when they develop solutions for the ageing population in digital health. Fischer et al. [138] conducted a systematic review on older users involvement in technology design, highlighting the need for inclusivity and tailored solutions. However, their focus on inclusive intervention in technology design is from a gerontologist's per-spective and does not deeply investigate key RE processes and techniques. Merkel and Kucharski [139] also examined participatory design in gerontechnology (Technology for ageing population support), emphasizing the value of involving older adults in the design process for more effective and user-friendly technologies but lacking focus on RE or SE issues. Chute et al. explored user requirements for co-managed digital health and care, applying emphasis towards understanding the diverse needs of users in co-managed care settings [140]. They highlighted the significance of user requirements in developing digital health aged care software, especially in integrated care models. However, their focus on co-managed care for comorbidity did not address issues related to prioritizing, documenting, and analysing requirements. Zhang et al. outlined a scoping review protocol focusing on co-design in residential aged care, showing a growing interest in this area [141]. This study collectively recognizes the benefits of co-design in enhancing technology and care practices for older adults in aged care facilities, indicating a positive trend towards more person-centred approaches. However, their protocols did not consider RE, nor did they examine the software details of residential aged care."}, {"title": "3.

Concept 2): Requirement* Engineering; Requirement elicitation; Require-ment extraction. Concept 3): Software Engineering; user*; UX; UI; personas; co-design. We used these concepts to formulate our search strings. We searched databases including ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Inspec, Springer, Wiley, Sage Journals Online, Taylor and Francis Online, and Scopus. The use of these databases was motivated by several factors. We incorporated well-known computer science sources such as ACM, IEEE, and Inspec, alongside medical-focused databases like Sage and Taylor & Francis. The key search strings used for different databases are listed in Table1.\nWe constructed a 'gold set' of primary studies that comprises a predefined selection of studies serving as a benchmark to evaluate our search strategy. This set was meticulously defined through reviews by all authors after initial searches in key databases like Scopus, ACM, and IEEE, ensuring that the selected articles met the inclusion criteria and were relevant to our research questions. In constructing the search string for each database, our aim was to ensure that the gold set papers were included in the search results. For example, a gold set paper from ACM should be included in the search results when using the ACM search string. In the event that our initial search results did not encompass all studies within the gold set, we refined our search strategy by revising the search string parameters to include additional studies.\nTo address potential oversights in the automated search process, a manual search was conducted in accordance with snowballing guidelines outlined by Wohlin [145]. A total of 26 initially selected gold set papers, along with relevant works, were subjected to iterative forward and backward snowballing. This process continued over three iterations until no further pertinent papers were identified. As a result, the snowballing yielded 26 additional papers."}, {"title": "3.3.

This might be related to the revolution of Machine learning and AI algorithms around 2016. As some studies have pointed out, after Machine Learning and AI showed their potential in the field of computing, many studies including digital health, HCI, and SE in healthcare have been adopting them [146, 147, 148]. The results suggest rising interest in RE for aged care software systems.\nFigure 3(b) illustrates the publication type distribution of our 69 primary studies.

Table 4 provides an overview of these aspects that were investigated in each study. We classify these into 3 main types of health aspects physical challenges (39 studies, 56.52%), mental challenges (14 studies, 20.29%), and ageing in general (21 studies, 30.43%).\nThe physical challenges studies focus on addressing key health challenges related to chronic challenges (7 studies), acute disease (1 study), and long-term care challenges (32 studies). For example, study S36 explored using virtual communities and mobile technology to improve healthcare for older adults with chronic diseases. Study S38 aimed to develop a mobile app prototype for older adults with osteoporosis using a user-centred design.\nMental challenges are mainly related to mental health or emotional challenges, including 11 studies on cognitive declines, 1 study on depression, 1 study on loneliness, and 1 study on parent-child relationships. For example, in study S51, the key aim is to utilize participatory design (PD) methods to enable older adults diagnosed with depression to actively participate in the design process of socially assistive robots.

S3 aims to gather requirements and develop an older adult caring application (Berbakti) to enhance the parent-child relationship in Indonesia.\nAgeing Challenges (in general) refers to challenges related to ageing, not specific diseases. For example, study S1 investigated factors influencing older adults' intention to use e-health services via smartphone. Study S32 evaluated the usability, user experience, and effectiveness of the GOAL mHealth intervention for inactive, sedentary older adults. Study S29 developed and tested an online community care platform for frail older adults, focusing on supporting their independence through care, health, and communication functions.\nWe collected data on the number of older adult participants, their age group distribution, and the average age of participants. If there were any caregivers or technical experts included, we noted their participation as well. We describe each of these findings in detail below.\nNumber of Participants: The number of older adult participants in each study is summarized in Figure 4. We divide number groups into six categories: 1-20 participants, 21-60 participants, 61-100 participants, 101+ participants, unclear (no evidence of participant numbers), and none (clearly stated no participants). The most common category is 1-20 participants, accounting for 43.5% of the studies. The next largest group is no participants and 101+ participants, both at 10.1%, followed by 21-60 participants at 8.7%, and no participants at 5.8%. The smallest group is 61-100 participants, representing 2.9%. These variations in sample size can be influenced by factors like the study's target institution size, local population density, funding, etc. Larger participant groups don't necessarily equate to higher participation quality, but they may affect the requirements quality and representation bias.\nAge Range of Participants: There is no universal definition of 'older adults', and the age range can vary by region or country. For instance, individuals aged 65 are often considered older adults in Australia, the UK, and the US, while in China, Thailand, and Malaysia, the threshold is typically 60.

We classified age bands as >=50 years old, >=55 years old, >=60 years old, >=65 years old, >=70 years old, >=75 years old, >=80 years old, and 85+ years old. We used the reported age range of participants and reported mean age to determine which band it falls into. Most studies involved participants aged >=65, followed by >=60, with no studies reporting age groups of >=75 or >=80. However, the mean age data shows that after the 65-70 group, the 75-80 group is the second largest, and the 80-85 group has 1 study. The discrepancy between age groups and mean ages likely reflects the common senior age in many countries, where most studies have participants with a mean age between 65 and 75. The lower numbers in the 80+ group may relate to availability, health concerns, and assistance needs [149].\nGender of Participants Figure 6 summarises the gender distribution of senior user participants in each study if reported. Figure 6(a) shows that among all the studies we included, there was a higher representation of more female than male participants, comprising 81% of the total sample, compared to male participants, who accounted for 19% of the total sample. Among the studies reporting gender data, there are 17 studies with female-skewed samples, 4 studies with a predominance of male participants, and 48 studies without participant gender information.

In the caregivers-only participants chart, half of the studies have more than 100 participants and the other half have only a few participants. We can see that a significant number of studies focusing solely on the older adult population without considering caregivers.\nParticipant Types: Figure 8 summarises the different participant types in the primary studies and the studies including single vs multiple types of participants. It can be seen that the most common partici-pant type is general healthcare providers, who are healthcare general practitioners or non-nominate aged caregivers but not clinicians, nurses, and other clinical experts. This suggests the importance of healthcare providers for gathering the needs of older adults in digital health studies. Other significant participant types were families (eg. S25, S3, S42) and clinicians and nurses (eg. S5, S27, S55). In some studies (eg. S52, S55, S2), all types of participants are used to understand older adult needs, while in other studies (eg. S47, S69, S28), they only include healthcare providers and older adults as participants.\nTable 5 summarises the key human aspects used in RE in our selected primary studies.

Introduction", "content": "In the technological development process, products are carriers of technology, and their success is determined by market demand. New products, as the result of technological progress, bring new market demands. For example, Apple's smartphones and Tesla's electric cars have opened the market for smartphones and electric cars,\nrespectively. Therefore, technological evolution has its own trajectory, followed by market selection. For many years, predicting the trajectory of technological evolution has always been the dream of the communities of engineering forecasting for new product development and innovation management. Due to technological development uncertainties, technological forecasting has always been an unattainable task. Correctly predicted technical breakthroughs have an impact not only on company growth, industry dynamics, and countries' economies but also on humanity's technological level. Inventive activity is inherently uncertain due to the multitude of factors and the complexity of their interactions. Reducing this uncertainty to predict the technological profile of successful products would undoubtedly assist businesses in making informed investment decisions. Proponents of evolutionary theory, which emphasizes the role of technological trajectory as a crucial determinant of innovation dynamics (Dosi, 1982; 1988), incorporate the notion that technological choices are dependent on non-technical factors such as institutional or economic elements. There are three instances where technological paths are shaped by non-technical reasons. First, although technological trajectories are path-dependent, they may be influenced by non-technological factors, as illustrated by the development of the QWERTY keyboard (David, 1985). Second, market selection might not be purely driven by technological performance; it could result from business success due to strategic decisions, despite lower technological performance (for example, JVC's VHS triumph over Sony's Betacam (Cusumano et al., 1992). More broadly, it is widely recognized that the invention process is affected by cognitive and social phenomena, which help to clarify why the search for technology is an uncertain endeavor (Fleming, 2001). This study, by focusing solely on the technological profile of existing products to predict the success of future technologies, not only suggests a belief in technological determinism but, more importantly, we believe that the technological\npaths formed due to non-technical reasons are already reflected in our product data. Our machine learning approach, based on historical data, ensures that the influence of historical non-technical factors on prediction outcomes is also included within the model.\nFor a long time, to analyze the development of species over time, a phylogenetic network has been widely used in understanding the process of gene transfer between species in biology. In the process of product and technology evolution, we can also use this species evolution concept for this study. The framework of the phylogenetic network is based on panel data and clusters individual species in the same period through similarity to form a population. As time passes, the relationship between the previous and next generations is determined based on similarity. In a conventional phylogenetic network, each node represents a taxon. The directed connection between the nodes represents the evolutionary relationship between the ancestor and descendent generations. Although each node has only one ancestor, it can have many descendants. Technology and biology evolutions have many common aspects. Phylogenetic networks can also be used to describe how technologies evolve. A technical product phylogenetic network, which is proposed by Lee et al. (2022), is a phylogenetic network generated by using technical information contained in products. It can describe product evolution.\nNevertheless, the analytical framework of phylogenetic networks in biology cannot be directly applied in the context of technological development. For example, a conventional phylogenetic network in biology cannot address the situation of multiple ancestors in technology evolution as they are often in the form of trees. Moreover, some important genes of technology are not necessarily inherited from the ancestor. However, they are likely to be inherited from other predecessors with little similarity. Because a conventional phylogenetic network only retains the most similar connections, we cannot see the links with other predecessors in this network. In addition, for the prediction of\ntechnological trajectories, the population in this research need not be clustered as clustering focuses on common information and neglects different types of minor information. However, minor information can be crucial in predicting the dominant product in this study. Therefore, based on a conventional phylogenetic network, we build a fully connected phylogenetic network (FCPN) in this study. Although previous research adopted a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to address the problem of multiple ancestors of phylogenetic networks, the DAG is only a subset of a fully connected framework. The main function of a conventional phylogenetic network is population development visualization. However, the data of a fully connected phylogenetic framework are constructed for technical prediction in this study. Using a fully connected phylogenetic graph neural network (FCP-GNN), we build a model that can predict the future dominant product. The model predicts whether a product can incorporate technologies that are likely to become dominant in the future. That is, we aim to predict whether brand-new technology in a product can become dominant in the future at the time of the technology's birth. This has an evident guiding significance for the scientific and technological strategic decision-making of enterprises or countries.\nIn a conventional method, the correlation of low-dimensional features is first calculated, a certain threshold is set, and relevant features that cannot reach the threshold are eliminated. In this case, some features that play a key role in high-dimensional features are also eliminated. However, in this study, all low-dimensional correlations are retained, and high-dimensional correlations accordingly are mined. In addition, the phylogenetic network is used as a graph to be the input, rather than simple structural panel data or time-series data. Because input data are based on a graph, it is an organic whole, rather than scattered points. The input graph must have a form suitable for the prediction of the subsequent step."}, {"title": "2. Literature and research question", "content": "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly covers some relevant works and proposes the research question. Section 3 introduces the framework of technological evolutionary phylogenetic networks and our research objective. Section 4 describes the general research process and data and introduces the method. Section 5 performs a case study of the dominant design prediction of Chinese mobile phones and then examines the model's validity. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our important results and future research.\nTechnological evolution is a theory that explains the mechanisms for the process of technological change. It follows biological evolution, which has its root in the book \"On the Origin of Species,\" written by Charles Darwin. In biological evolution, the information being replicated and inherited from an ancestor to the next generation is defined as genotypes. In Farrell's (1993) study, considering the analogy between biological evolution and similar processes in technological evolution, the heuristic principle of \"Generalized Darwinism\" can explain aspects of technological development. In the product space, all the products comprise technologies as their attributes. By improving their attributes, they can have their evolutionary process and can form a product network based on their similarities among generations. Further, products have an evolutionary process among generations. Their evolutions are formed by changing the combination of different technologies. By the interaction of technologies transferring between products, an evolutionary product network can be formed. Every product can be regarded as a node in this network, and this network can expand over time. Hence, this process is the product of technological evolution. In this paper, we define product\ngenotypes as the technologies, which are included in the product. The genotype can represent the technical characteristics of the product. In biology, a chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. We define the product chromosome as a string that can represent all the technologies in the products.\nAccording to Utterback and Abernathy (1975), a dominant design is the one that is favored by the market, the one to which rivals and innovators must conform if they want to command a considerable market share. While Klepper (1996, 1997) suggests that the shift from an exploration phase to a shakeout is dictated by economic factors associated with the industry's demand structure, the concept of a dominant design resolves technological uncertainty. This resolution fundamentally changes the nature of innovation, transitioning from product to process innovation, and significantly impacts the competitive dynamics of the industry. A dominant design is a new product that is formed and integrated with multiple technologies. The emergence of the dominant design establishes a technological track for a certain product category; thus, other technological tracks are rejected by the market. Anderson and Tushman (1990) empirically suggested the operation definition of a dominant design; that is, a single or a narrow range of configurations that accounted for over 50% of new products or process installations and maintained a 50% market share for more than 4 years. According to Suarez et al. (2015), the dominant category is that most stakeholders adhere to the conceptual schema when referring to products that address similar requirements and compete for the same market space. From Abernathy and Utterback's (1978) opinion, dominant design is a turning point to the emergence of industrial changes by standardization and enables manufacturers to set up a mass-manufacturing system, which is also issued by Murmann and Frenken (2006). By using data on mobile phones from 1990 to 2003, Koski et al.(2007) analyzed the emergence of a dominant design and found that, dominant design\nforms only in horizontal but not vertical product features. In this paper, we defined the dominant technology (genotype) as the technology, which was contained by most products on the market and detect it by using a threshold of 50% of the new products which contain this technology in one specific year. This only followed Anderson and Tushman's (1990) operational definition. We also defined a new operational concept of the dominant product. When certain technology first appears on the market, it is contained in product A. If this technology becomes a dominant technology in the future, we defined product A as a dominant product. There is no limit to how many years later Product A can become dominant. However, from the result of this study, on average, it is around 3 years in the Chinese mobile phone dataset. We make the definition of similar dominant products because we aim to detect the dominant technology by the year of its birth, rather than the year when it becomes dominant, i.e., over a specific market share (i.e., 50%). We designed the concept of a \u201cdominant product\" only for the technology prediction. Its actual meaning is a product that contains a future dominant technology. Therefore, our \"dominant product\" concept is different from a conventional concept of a dominant product, which refers to a product that owns over 50% market share. If we predict a product as \"dominant,\" this implies that this product has some specific technologies that will become dominant in the future. Specifically, predicting our \"dominant product\" is more meaningful than a conventional dominant product as the conventional dominant product is a fact and does not need to be predicted.\nIn recent years, machine learning has been greatly developed as a data analysis method. Although machine learning methods have been used widely in many fields, the progress in the field of technology evolution prediction is relatively slow. Wang et al.\n(1999) were the first to propose the possibility of predicting future technology with artificial neural networks (ANNs). In their study, they used a combination of chaos theory and ANN to perform forecasting. Unfortunately, they provided only a conceptual framework without empirical verification. As Markou and Singh (2003) mentioned, although a few novelty detection models used a neural network, they were not related to technological evolution and dominant design prediction. Our model attempts to adopt machine learning to predict future technology based on phylogenetic networks. Many machine learning methods can capture non-linear relationships in a complex system, such as support vector regression (SVR) and decision trees, which use statistical methods to handle classification problems with some explanatory power. However, conventional machine learning methods' accuracy cannot compare with that of deep neural networks (DNNs) with big data. Biswas et al. (2022) forecasted the specification of the most influential features of future products by ANNs. However, this approach can only forecast the technological improvement in the same technological features and cannot handle new features that come out every year. Our study employed a DNN-based model approach to improve prediction capabilities and it can predict dominant products using not only the existing technological features but also information about new technologies that come out every year.\nInstead of the conventional machine learning methods for prediction of the technology evolution, we used the technological phylogenetic network combined with graph neural network (GNN) models to obtain a better predictive capability. Our research question is how to construct the technological phylogenetic networks and combine them with the GNN to predict future dominant products."}, {"title": "3. Conceptual framework and research objective", "content": "A product's evolutionary process is driven by a combination of the genotypes transferred from the previous generation and the newly created genotypes. New products are formed by these two types of genotypes. The genotypes transferring from the previous generation include vertical transmission (VT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which have been discussed in Gyles and Boerlin's (2014) study. These newly created genotypes refer to mutation. The dynamic movement and combination of all these genotypes create new products, and the chronological evolution of all products can be represented as a phylogenetic network. Specifically, the technological product evolutionary phylogenetic network is the foundation of our study.\nA phylogenetic network is a graph that can visualize the evolutionary relationships between nodes. This concept follows a rooted phylogenetic tree, which can present the evolutionary history of a set of species in the biological field. In a biological phylogenetic network, nodes represent species, but the chronological order is inaccurate. Meanwhile, the links between species are kinship. A technological phylogenetic network has exact chronological order, and the nodes can be a product or a taxon, which is a cluster of products. The links in the technological phylogenetic network are calculated based on similarities between the nodes in adjacent generations. The phylogenetic tree is a type of phylogenetic network. According to Huson and Bryant (2006), the difference between them is that, in a phylogenetic tree, every node can only have a single ancestor, whereas, in the phylogenetic network, nodes can have multiple ancestors. Huson and Scornavacca (2011) describe a graph using the concept of the DAG, indicating a directed graph devoid of cycles. In this paper, we defined the FCPN. In the FCPN, 1 year is regarded as a generation. All the nodes in each generation have fully directed connections to each node\nin the next adjacent generation. However, they do not have connections with nodes in other generations, including the current generation. Technically, this network is fully connected within adjacent generations only, not with all the generations. Although no direct connections exist between non-adjacent generations, the nodes in non-adjacent generations can be connected by indirect connections. In technological evolution, the main point is that information or genotypes can be spread from generation to generation. In the FCPN, any genotype in any node can be transmitted to any node in subsequent generations. The structural difference between the FCPN and the phylogenetic tree is that the FCPN keeps all links among adjacent generations. Conversely, a conventional evolutionary phylogenetic tree keeps just the most possible connection between generations.\nWhen building a conventional technological evolutionary phylogenetic tree, as proposed by Lee et al. (2022) to investigate the technology evolutionary process, two types of conventional evolutionary phylogenetic trees can be used: a product phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) and a taxonomic phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). [Fig. 1 near here] In the product phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), every node is a product. The directed links between the nodes in adjacent generations show their ancestor-descendant relationship. The link is determined by calculating the similarity between the node and all the nodes in the previous generation. In the previous generation, only the node with high similarity has a link with the node. Therefore, the link is directed from the ancestor to the descendant. In the technology evolution, we defined the taxon as a species, indicating a group of products with similar technologies. Researchers must cluster similar products in every generation to form the taxon and find their ancestor taxon based on high similarity with the previous generation. In the technology evolution, a product can be composed of a set of technologies (genotypes), and a taxon is composed of a set of products that contain similar\ntechnologies. Thus, researchers can find products' families and lineage. Whether it is a conventional product phylogenetic tree or a taxonomic phylogenetic tree, each node can only have one ancestor. The pseudo-code for building the conventional phylogenetic trees is represented by Algorithm 1. [Algorithm 1 near here]\nUnlike conventional phylogenetic trees, the FCPN does not specify one ancestor. Its structure can guarantee that any genotype of a previous generation can be spread to the next generation without loss and clustering nodes to form taxon is not necessary. Moreover, in conventional phylogenetic trees, as each descendant only has one ancestor by high similarity, the FCPN forms the link bottlenecks for gene transferring between adjacent generations, leading to less diversity. In the FCPN, no direct genotype transferring exists with non-adjacent generations. However, genotypes can use more indirect paths transferring to non-adjacent descendants. Fig. 2 shows an example comparison of a conventional phylogenetic tree and an FCPN. Evidently, the conventional phylogenetic tree and an FCPN have the same nodes, and the difference between them is the links. Because of these different links, their structures also vary. As also shown in the figure, a conventional phylogenetic tree is a subgraph of the FCPN. If we transform the FCPN to a conventional phylogenetic tree, we lose some links, leading to the loss of information. [Fig. 2 near here]\nThis study aims to predict dominant products by using a deep learning model based on the FCP-GNN framework through product evolution structural data. Once a dominant design emerges, the functional model remains unchanged over an extended period, even though the components continue to evolve (Robinson et al., 2024). Therefore, predicting the dominant design holds practical significance for product design. One dominant product contains at least one future dominant technology. Our model can"}, {"title": "4. Methodology", "content": "predict the dominant products that contain dominant technology in the birth year of this technology, rather than judging it as a dominant product after the technology it contains becomes dominant. For example, technology \u201ca\u201d is born in product \u201cb\u201d in the year 2010, and \u201ca\u201d becomes dominant in the year 2014. Further, there is product \u201cc\u201d in 2014 that contains \"a.\" Specifically, \u201ca\u201d is a dominant genotype; therefore, \u201cb\u201d is a dominant product. However, \u201cc\u201d may not be a dominant product. To achieve this, our task is to train an FCP-GNN-based DNN model and then find the optimal parameters of the GNN in Eq. 2 and other parameters in the following DNN models for an accurate prediction. The GNN and DNN make up the prediction function. When we optimize the prediction function, we must minimize the sum of prediction losses. We can obtain the best parameters through optimization. As this is a classification task, the loss function is the cross-entropy function. After training the model, the prediction function enables us to predict the future dominant design.\nAs it incurs time for the technology to spread, a brand-new technology incurs time from being introduced to becoming dominant. To forecast whether a certain technology can become dominant, we must allow it enough time to grow. Then, we can verify if it can be dominant. If the observation period is relatively short, the technology that can become dominant in the future may be wrongly determined as non-dominant. In this case, we assume that the average growth time for a brand-new technology to become dominant is approximately three years on average. The reason we selected three years is explained in the \"Dominant technologies\" section. The detailed results of the dominant technology growing years are presented in the \"Results\" section. Therefore, we use the data from the\nlast three years as our test dataset. Our splitting approach causes the training data and test data to be not independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.), which influences the result's accuracy. We assume that the data of the training data set and test data set are close to the i.i.d.\nFurthermore, in the construction of the FCPN, we assume the technologies of the product, i.e. product attributes, are the genotypes, and one-hot encoding can be used to convert them into chromosomes for every product. Additionally, the chromosome which consists of a set of genotypes can represent mobile phone products. We also assume that all the products in the same year cannot transfer genotypes with one another. Moreover, we assume that genotypes can be transferred only through adjacent years, which means this transferring process can happen only from a generation in the year T to the generation in the year T+1 but not T+i (i=2,3,...,n). Considering every product as a node, we assume every node has at least one ancestor except the first generation. Furthermore, we can construct links (edges) between ancestors and descendants. Moreover, we assume the link's direction is from the ancestor to the descendant, and the link's property (weight) indicates their similarity.\nIn this study, we used Chinese mobile phone data to construct the FCPN as mobile phone information can be easily obtained from the Internet. Further, we selected the Chinese market as it is the largest single-country market for mobile phones. China is the biggest producer of mobile phones. Therefore, the time lag between production and sale is short, and there are several brands of mobile phones. We collected the information from one of the largest mobile phone information websites in China (mobile.zol.com.cn) by Web Crawler. We collected 3642 mobile phone products with attributes based on a 3- level hierarchical structure (Fig. 3). The first level shows the main parts of the mobiles,\nand the second level shows the sub-parts of the first level. Furthermore, 19378 attributes are present at the third level. We only used the third-level attributes. After cleaning the data, we obtained 3430 products with 11126 attributes (genotypes). The mobile phone dataset includes 21 years (from 2001 to 2021) of product data, but in 2021, the data were until the 15th of March, implying that the data of 2021 has information of only 2.5 months. The cleaned dataset was provided by He (2022). We used Python, TensorFlow, and Spektral to develop our algorithm. Spektral is a specialized package developed by Grattarola and Alippi (2020) for graph learning based on the TensorFlow framework. We split the dataset into a training dataset, a validation dataset, and a test dataset. We used the validation dataset to avoid overfitting. [Fig. 3 near here]\nAmong the 11126 genotypes, we detected the dominant ones. A dominant genotype is in one specific year, and its count is more than 50% of the total product count. We found out that there are 161 genotypes that are dominant (without repeating) in the 21 years considered. Owing to some reasons related to calculations, we define the \"dominant product.\u201d The dominant product is a product that is the first to have at least one future dominant genotype. We found 657 dominant products in these 21 years. Then we classified the products into the dominant and non-dominant ones, which are our labels in machine learning. The detailed data are presented in Table 3.\nFirst, we need to transfer these genotypes into binary numbers by one-hot encoding so that they can represent the technologies in the products. We can assign each product a fixed length one-row vector that only consists of 0 or 1 in each dimension, where different columns represent different genotypes in the vector. We use this vector as the product's chromosome in this research. Second, completely link to the products from adjacent years. We use the chromosomes of the products to calculate their similarity and set the similarity as the link weight. The entire connected network is our FCPN. This\nis a directed graph. We compute the Jaccard similarity of chromosomes in Eq. 1 between paired products to obtain link weights.\n$Similarity(A, B) = \\frac{ANB}{AUB}$ Eq. 1\nwhere A and B are chromosomes of various products. The entire process of building an FCPN is a transformation from unstructured data to graph form. Pseudocode is in Algorithm 2. [Algorithm 2 near here]\nIn this case, our FCPN is a homogeneous graph. All the nodes are products, and the genotype information is extracted from their attributes. Our objective is to predict the dominant design. To prepare the data to train the model, we detect the dominant genotypes first. The dominant genotypes refer to the genotypes that can be dominant in the future. This genotype is labeled as dominant only in the first year of its appearance but not in the following years. Subsequently, we assign the labels to dominant products. Dominant products are those that include the dominant genotypes. One dominant product must include at least one dominant genotype. Therefore, there may be more than one dominant genotype in one dominant product. Some dominant products may include the same dominant genotypes in an identical year. Thus, the dominant products include the genotype that can be dominant in the future, but we only label them in the year when the genotype appears. This is to avoid the situation where the machine learning algorithm can judge whether the genotype is dominant or not according to the number of annual growths of the genotype, as there is no information regarding the history of the genotype before its appearance. In other words, if we predict the dominant genotype in its dominant year, instead of its birth year, then the algorithm can predict the genotype using its historical information by simply detecting the annual growth trend of genotype count and product count ratio and then determining the dominant product. Therefore, our approach has more"}, {"title": "5. Results", "content": "predictive power. A label is a binary number. If the product is dominant, the label is 1, and it is 0 otherwise. Fig. 4 provides an illustration of the method of identification of the dominant product. In year T, there is a product 1 in which the 3rd genotype value is 1. Furthermore, it is the first time that the 3rd genotype appears in the entire product set. In year T+1, the 3rd genotype's market ratio is 1/3 which is less than 50%. In year T+2, there are a total of five products. Among these, three of them have the 3rd genotype value 1. The ratio is 3/5, which is more than 50%. Therefore, in year T+2, the 3rd genotype becomes a dominant genotype, and hence, product 1 is a dominant product. [Fig. 4 near here", "here": "nWe split the dataset into three parts-training, validation, and test data. Specifically, training data include the products from 2001 to 2015. The validation dataset\ncontains the products from 2015 to 2018. The test dataset has the products from 2019 to 2021. Then, for robustness, we split training, validation, and test datasets with different year periods in several ways and apply our method. As we used the single data model to perform the node classification task in GNN, we must use the whole graph as the input and therefore use masks for differentiating the different datasets.

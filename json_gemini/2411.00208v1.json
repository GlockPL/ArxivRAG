These range from climate change adaptation and mitigation to social equity\nand economic resilience. The complexity of urban systems, characterised by interdependencies between the built\nenvironment, social structures and ecological processes, requires sophisticated approaches to planning, delivering and\nmonitoring, with a focus on the strategic planning phase to allow for strong strategic foundations [1].

Their\nability to process complex, context-dependent information makes them well-suited for tasks that require both broad\nknowledge and specific domain understanding.

This approach can later be\nported to more recent models (in particular the latest OpenAI 40-mini model). Its large knowledge base, trained on\nvarious datasets, makes it well suited for interpreting different urban project descriptions from a general perspective.\nWe also considered factors such as the accessibility of the API, the consistency of the results and the possibilities for\nfine-tuning.

This holistic view encourages integrated approaches to\nurban development and encourages collaboration between different departments and disciplines.

Using the standard categorisation, users can identify analogous projects or measures that have been successfully\nimplemented in other places. A simple cosine-based similarity score (based on a likert score, applied to the 144-long\nvector categorizing the 12 issues, 6 purposes, and 2 scales) has been successfully applied to sort solutions, based on its\ncolinearity with the needs profile.\nThis exchange of ideas and solutions has the potential to be powerful as it is based on the overview understanding of\ncity services and sustainability impacts rather than superficial similarities. For example, a community's need for greater\nsocial cohesion around environmental preservation may lead to the discovery of innovative green space initiatives that\nhave fostered community engagement elsewhere. This approach can accelerate the learning process for communities\nstakeholder, and the adaptation and scaling of proven solutions in different urban contexts.

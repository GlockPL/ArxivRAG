To transform these workplace dynamics, this paper proposes creating culturally-aware workplace tools, specifically designed to adapt to the cultural dimensions of monochronic and polychronic work styles. We illustrate this approach with \"CultureFit,\" a tool that we engineered based on extensive research in Chronemics and culture theories. To study and evaluate our tool in the real world, we conducted a field experiment with 55 workers from 24 different countries. Our field experiment revealed that CultureFit significantly improved the earnings of workers from cultural backgrounds often overlooked in design. Our study is among the pioneering efforts to examine culturally aware digital labor interventions. It also provides access to a dataset with over two million data points on culture and digital work, which can be leveraged for future research in this emerging field. The paper concludes by discussing the importance and future possibilities of incorporating cultural insights into the design of tools for digital labor.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Crowdworkers significantly enhance Al services [53, 89, 104], yet often face poor working conditions [57], particularly non-US/European workers whose cultural backgrounds differ from the intended design of crowdsourcing platforms [27, 139, 180]. This issue usually stems from the assumption that crowdworkers are a homogeneous group [56], neglecting their diverse cultural backgrounds [90]. Moreover, a notable trend in design has emerged advocating for minimizing cultural impact in work interfaces, aiming for global uniformity in their design rather than customizing these systems to accommodate cultural nuances [133, 134, 193]. Consequently, many work interfaces have strived for uniform standards, and have ignored worker diversity [76, 84, 88].\nHowever, interfaces often reflect the cultural biases of their designers [18], inadvertently embedding their cultural norms [146, 150, 177]. This can lead to designs that unintentionally require \"outside workers\" to adapt or modify their behaviors [126, 177], potentially hindering their success and effectiveness in their jobs [24, 60, 64, 85]. A solution can be to create culturally aware tools for crowdworkers, yet research into integrating culture theory into such designs remains limited [108, 118, 163]. Further research is crucial to assess these systems' effectiveness and their potential benefits for crowdworkers from varied cultural backgrounds.\nTo address this knowledge gap, we focus on designing a tool that aims to enhance crowdworkers' experiences by incorporating cultural considerations. Drawing from culture theory, we apply Chronemics-a discipline used in"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Our research connects with the following key areas of prior literature:\n2.1 Universal Design.\nVast work in the field of universal design has questioned the usefulness of culturally-informed interfaces [134, 136, 174]. While universal design is aware of the clashes that exist due to the lack of cultural awareness in design, it also argues that people will eventually adjust to the non-culturally-aware interfaces [101, 134]. This view-point has allowed universal design to make products and provide \"equivalent experiences\" for a wider range of possible users than addressing the specific accessibility or inclusive goals of smaller targeted populations [75, 174, 176]. Universal design has thus positioned itself as a \u201cculturally-neutral\u201d design framework [71, 72]. Norman and the researchers who follow his work have argued that designs become more approachable to a wider global audience upon the removal of individualistic and cultural human elements [135]. Norman argues that people will adapt to activities in ways not necessarily innate, supporting the prevailing importance of designing for \"activity over culture\" [134].\nOur research considers that while it might be true that people will eventually adapt to interfaces not tailored to their culture [134], the adaptation period can generate harm [148, 169], e.g., cost people their livelihood [57]. Prior work has also established that there is a link between cross-cultural differences and outcomes like mental health and job performance [50]. Current research on homogeneous designs also indicates that prevailing design norms may indeed lead to reduced success for some crowdworkers [76, 84, 88]. Additionally, there is concern that crowdworkers from cultures underrepresented in design frequently have to engage in higher rates of unpaid labor, leading to poorer work experiences [26, 50, 59, 94, 132, 180]. Consequently, we advocate for culturally-aware design.\n2.2 Chronemics and Different Cultural Dimensions within Time Management.\nA key goal of designing culturally aware interfaces is determining what long-term aspects of a culture are important to consider [119, 144]. Hall and Hall [62, 63], argued that key cultural variables to consider are people's concepts of time. This falls under the study of Chronemics, which is the study of time perceptions, and \"... includes time orientation, understanding and organisation, the use of and reaction to time pressures, the innate and learned awareness of time...\" [151]. This theory extends to the social and cultural level, and can be used describe work patterns across cultures and societies [63]. Hall and Hall identified two main cultural concepts of time: (1) monochronic, and (2) polychronic [63]. They established that cultures with a monochronic time use, view time as linear [63]. This helps these individuals focus on doing one thing at a time, as time becomes something that can be scheduled and compartmentalized [63, 125]. According to the theory, Monochronic workers typically prioritize schedules highly [182], often valuing them above building social relationships [13]. They also prefer to limit multi-tasking and minimize distractions [108, 182].\nBy contrast, polychronic cultures view time as something occurring within the context of multiple events and the constant involvement of other people [62, 63]. In these cultures, it is more important to complete human transactions than to adhere to schedules [182]. Polychronic workers thus tend to value receiving unpredictable alerts, particularly those related to relationship building [182], as well as favor flexible, spontaneous, and concurrent work schedules [61, 62, 109], and prefer to work while engaging in other activities [50, 94]. We use insights from this culture theory to design better tools for global crowdworkers."}, {"title": "2.3 Culture and Crowd Work.", "content": "Crowdsourcing platforms allow non-experts to find new jobs [57]. These platforms are usually also not tied to a particular geographical region [47, 73]. The results are that more people from different parts of the world are exploring crowd work as a viable job option [47, 95]. The growing global nature of crowd work has led HCI researchers to study the demographics of crowdworkers [69, 157], helping to shed light on the different cultures present in crowd work and the problems they face [47, 66, 121, 129, 132]. On the other hand, recent research has identified that many crowdworkers have a tendency to follow polychronic work patterns [107]. Workers with this type of cultural background have also tended to experience more hardships [26, 55, 81, 117, 121], and have been joining crowdsourcing platforms in increasing numbers [47, 129, 132]. This prior work serves as motivation for our research, as it highlights the need to create tools that can support workers with diverse cultural backgrounds."}, {"title": "2.4 The Tooling Add-on Movement.", "content": "Crowdsourcing platforms have recently been augmented with a suite of tools to improve them for both workers and requesters [39, 42, 67, 161, 162]. Such a tooling movement has focused on creating change for workers and requesters without needing buy-in from the crowdsourcing platforms themselves [100, 162]. Most of these tools have taken the form of \"web add-ons\" (plugins) that provide additional functionalities to the platforms [153, 159, 191]. For instance, Turkopticon enhances the functionality of the crowdsourcing platform of Amazon Mechanical Turk by enabling workers to rate requesters [86, 170]. This \"add-on\u201d has helped workers fight power imbalances and information asymmetries [86, 99, 159]. We take inspiration from this to now augment crowdsourcing platforms with culturally aware interfaces."}, {"title": "2.5 Worker Community System Designs.", "content": "A number of data-driven tools have facilitated collaboration and community-building among workers [17, 44, 74, 93, 141, 143, 145], including crowdworkers. These tools have improved how workers collaborate and help foster a sense of unity. For example, Coworker.org, an NGO dedicated to empowering workers and developing power-building strategies in the modern economy [46], has developed a calculator tool that skillfully analyzes the wage data of platform workers [37]. This tool clarifies payment practices and encourages mutual support among workers, enabling them to challenge unfair pay practices from requesters. Other tools have been designed to help workers collaborate with each other to identify potential wage theft and unpaid work [21, 54, 137, 180], as well as flag safety risks [2, 33]. Tools like Turkopticon and Turkerview are specifically designed to facilitate crowdworker collaboration by allowing them to share information about requesters, ultimately aiding in the identification of more favorable job opportunities [86, 160]. Additionally, online forums like Turker Nation have played a crucial role in cultivating a community and promoting collaborative learning among crowdworkers, enhancing their collective knowledge and support network [121, 189, 197]. These platforms and tools have begun to foster mutual support for workplace challenges. Our paper explores how to enhance support for crowdworkers by recognizing their cultural identities."}, {"title": "3 CULTUREFIT", "content": "CultureFit is a tool designed to improve the experiences of crowdworkers by tailoring job notifications to their cultural backgrounds. Drawing from the \"Tooling Add-on Movement\" in crowd work [86, 153, 159, 170, 191], CultureFit functions autonomously as a Chrome plugin, operating independently without requiring official support from crowdsourcing platforms such as Toloka. Grounded in culture theory [64, 65], our tool is designed to accommodate cultural variations in time perception, specifically monochronic and polychronic cultural orientations. CultureFit leverages these distinctions to tailor notifications about available tasks to workers [6, 82, 111, 122].\nIt can be important to observe that by notifying workers about tasks on Toloka, CultureFit can help to streamline the process of finding work [57]. This can help to minimize the unpaid labor of task searching-one of the most burdensome types of unpaid labor in crowd work [180]. Overall, CultureFit is a crowd work tool that streamlines the discovery of relevant tasks through culturally aware notifications, thereby reducing workers' need to navigate extensive lists. Unlike other tools aimed at aiding workers in finding tasks [38, 160, 190, 192], CultureFit distinctively integrates cultural sensitivity into its notification design.\nAnother thing to observe is that CultureFit has a task recommendation algorithm, which determines which tasks workers are notified about. For more details on how this recommendation algorithm works, please see our Appendix. Note that while interesting, this recommendation algorithm is not our main research contribution and is hence not detailed here.\nCultureFit enhances cultural awareness in crowd work through two culturally sensitive notifications:"}, {"title": "3.1 Polychronic Work Notification Interface.", "content": "CultureFit caters to workers with polychronic cultural traits, who, according to the theory, favor flexible, spontaneous, and concurrent work schedules [61, 62, 109]. Thus, our tool opportunistically notifies polycronic workers about job opportunities across the worker's computer operating system, web browser, or crowdsourcing marketplace. In this way, the tool is able to reach workers while they are doing different activities. Figure 2 presents how CultureFit can notify workers about labor opportunities within different contexts, and also in a peripheral manner, to facilitate opportunistic work schedules and multi-tasking (something related work recommends for polychronic workers [108]). CultureFit's"}, {"title": "3.2 Monochronic Notification Interface.", "content": "In the case of workers who follow Monochronic labor patterns [65], CultureFit notifies about tasks in a way that will allow them to manage their work days in a focused and efficient manner. For this purpose, CultureFit provides task notifications only when workers are on the Toloka platform, considering that these workers, according to the theory, prefer to limit multi-tasking [13]. CultureFit also makes sure to notify workers about tasks only after the workers have finished the labor they are currently doing, and only notifies them about tasks that will fit within the worker's established schedule. For this purpose, the tool favors notifying about tasks that can be completed within the worker's schedule over tasks that might require working over time, even if the tasks match the worker's preferred type or come from their favorite requesters (to predict the amount of time a task will take, we use techniques from prior work [158, 160]). For monochronic workers, CultureFit also strategically limits notifications from social media, emails, and messages from requesters on the crowdsourcing platform. This approach aligns with research findings that emphasize monochronic workers' preferences for fewer interruptions, and a more focused approach to social connections and work tasks [13, 108]."}, {"title": "4 USER SCENARIOS", "content": "We present user scenarios on how monochronic and polychronic workers would use CultureFit. We aim to enhance understanding of the context in which CultureFit is used, especially within the Toloka crowdsourcong platform."}, {"title": "4.1 User Scenario for Monochronic Crowdworker: Bob", "content": "Bob is a dedicated monochronic crowdworker who prefers to work in a structured manner. He likes to focus on one task at a time and finds it distracting to sift through multiple tasks on traditional crowdsourcing platforms. Bob's typical workday is well-planned, with specific times allocated for different activities, including work, meals, and leisure.\nBefore CultureFit, Bob would log into Toloka every morning spending a significant amount of time searching through tasks to find the ones that fit his schedule and expertise [98]. This process was time-consuming and led to frustration, as Bob felt that he could have used this time to actually work on tasks. He also found it challenging to resist the temptation of non-work-related notifications (e.g., activities on social media), which occasionally disrupted his focus.\nAfter adopting CultureFit, Bob now receives notifications about tasks on Toloka that are aligned with his schedule and work preferences. This change has improved his work efficiency and satisfaction. He no longer needs to manually search for tasks each morning. Instead, Bob receives a curated list of tasks right before his designated work time, allowing him to dive straight into focused work. CultureFit also blocks non-work-related notifications during his work hours, helping him maintain his concentration. Bob appreciates how CultureFit understands his monochronic work style and tailors the notification system to enhance his focus. This allows him to be more productive and achieve a better work-life balance, as he can now dedicate his planned work time more effectively and enjoy his leisure time without worrying about missing out on tasks."}, {"title": "4.2 User Scenario for Polychronic Crowdworker: Alejandro", "content": "Alejandro is a dynamic polychronic crowdworker who thrives on multitasking. He enjoys working on multiple tasks simultaneously and often juggles work with other activities like socializing or hobbies. Alejandro prefers a flexible work environment where he can switch between tasks as his interest and energy dictate.\nBefore CultureFit, Alejandro found traditional crowdsourcing platforms somewhat restrictive and inefficient for his working style. He would often miss out on social happenings or interesting tasks because he was too engrossed in another activity. Alejandro wanted a system that would automatically notify him of new opportunities, eliminating the need to continuously monitor the crowdsourcing platform or sift through lengthy lists of available tasks.\nAfter adopting CultureFit, Alejandro's work experience has been transformed as the tool provides notifications that support his multitasking nature. Now, while engaged in one task on Toloka, he receives alerts for other tasks that match his interests, allowing him to seamlessly transition between jobs without losing momentum. Additionally, CultureFit alerts him to social happenings and networking opportunities, ensuring he does not miss out on valuable human-to-human experiences. Alejandro appreciates the tool's flexibility, particularly its ability to recognize his polychronic tendencies and offer a work experience tailored to his dynamic style. With CultureFit, he feels more connected to work opportunities and social engagements, enhancing both his professional and personal life."}, {"title": "5 METHODS", "content": "Our IRB-approved field experiment focused on comparing the experiences of crowdworkers who utilized CultureFit and those who did not. This helped us better grasp the impact of culturally aware tools on crowdworkers. We thus implemented a between-subjects design, which included control groups that did not use CultureFit and intervention groups that did. These groups were further divided into sub-groups based on the cultural orientations of the workers, categorizing them as either monochronic or polychronic. We had overall the following groups:\n(1) Monochronic workers using CultureFit on Toloka (intervention group).\n(2) Polychronic workers using CultureFit on Toloka (intervention group).\n(3) Monochronic workers following their usual work routine on Toloka WITHOUT CultureFit (control group).\n(4) Polychronic workers following their usual work routine on Toloka WITHOUT CultureFit (control group)."}, {"title": "5.1 Pre-Test Stage.", "content": "We initiated our study with a 7-day \"Pre-Test Stage\" applicable to all workers. As mentioned above, this pre-test phase helped us establish a baseline understanding of the wages, perceptions, and digital behaviors among crowdworkers across our four conditions. The duration and structure of this stage, as well as subsequent stages in our study, were informed by prior research [29, 160, 180]. To establish our baseline, we guided all workers through a structured process:\n(1) Pre-Survey Completion: All workers completed a pre-survey that we crafted to gather information about their demographics, crowd work experiences, and to classify them as either polychronic or monochronic workers. Our Appendix presents our pre-survey.\n(2) Web-plugin Installation: All workers installed a web-plugin equipped with telemetry tracking, which we designed in accordance with prior work [158, 180]. The web-plugin helps us to monitor and quantify workers' digital behavior (e.g., hourly wages and task completion rates). We allowed the uninstallation of our web-plugin at any time and offered financial rewards for study participation. After installing our web-plugin and finishing the pre-survey, all workers received $2 USD, an amount set to surpass the US federal minimum wage of $7.25/hour for a task under 10 minutes [171]. Workers also earned an extra $0.5 daily for simply keeping our web-plugin installed, totaling $3.5 for the 7-day Pre-Test Stage.\n(3) Do Crowd Work: Participants did crowd work as usual for 7 days.

We further categorized responses using intra-question affinity diagramming, with the authors independently coding data and collaboratively developing three thematic codes."}, {"title": "5.5 Participants.", "content": "Similar to prior work [108], we used the Toloka crowdsourcing platform to recruit participants. We posted a detailed task description outlining all study requirements and steps, including completion of surveys, web-plugin installation, and data collection. Workers were also informed that they could drop out of the study at any time and would be compensated for the duration of their participation. Workers interested in participating were required to complete a pre-survey questionnaire upon accepting the study terms. This pre-survey used the Multitasking Preference Inventory (MPI) to evaluate workers' polychronic or monochronic tendencies [138]. The MPI, a 14-item self-assessment tool, is more effective than earlier scales like the Inventory of Polychronic Values (IPV) in distinguishing individual and cultural work styles [12]. It includes statements rated on a 5-point scale, assessing multitasking behavior and task-switching preferences [138]. Scores indicate a preference for either monochronic or polychronic work habits. We categorized workers into monochronic or polychronic groups based on their stated preferences. We recruited 55 participants (23 monochronic, 32 polychronic) from a diverse pool across 24 countries, including the US, Middle-East, Central and South America, various African countries, South and Southeast Asia, and Eastern and Western Europe.

Such direction is vital to the field of CSCW, as it opens up new opportunities for creating computational artifacts that can support the global workforce that exists on crowdsourcing platforms [40, 41, 48, 140, 185]. Through our real-world field experiments, we started to see the potential benefits of having a culturally-sensitive tool, particularly for workers with polychronic traits [41, 108, 110, 128]. This can be important, as previous studies had shown that these workers are often disproportionately affected by the challenges of crowd work [26, 57, 108, 180]."}, {"title": "7.1 Understanding the Integration of Cultural Insights in Crowd Work Tool Design", "content": "Inspired by culture theory [6, 12, 64, 155", "64": "."}]}

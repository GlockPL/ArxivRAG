In recent years, the trend has been to scale up LLMs to unprecedented sizes, with models boasting from tens to even hundreds of billions of parameters OpenAI [2023], Touvron et al. [2023]. These massive models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, from language translation to text generation.\nHowever, as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, concerns about their potential biases and unfair outcomes have also grown Bolukbasi et al. [2016], Gallegos et al. [2023], Li et al. [2023]. The development of newer LLMs often relies on the outputs of foundational models, which can perpetuate and amplify existing biases. This occurs when newer models are trained on data generated by previous, potentially biased models, leading to a compounding effect that can result in more biased outcomes Bommasani et al. [2021], Sheng et al. [2021].\nDespite the growing awareness of these issues, the detection and mitigation of biases in LLMs remain significant challenges. Many existing bias detection methods focus on explicit biases, which are often easily identifiable and can be addressed through debiasing techniques Ranaldi et al. [2023], Li et al. [2024]. However, recent research has shown that LLMs can also harbor implicit biases, which are more insidious and difficult to detect Gupta et al. [2023], Bai et al. [2024]. These implicit biases can have significant consequences, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discriminatory outcomes in AI systems."}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "Research on bias in language models has a rich history, with early efforts focusing on detecting biases in word and sentence-level embeddings using methods such as WEAT Caliskan et al. [2016], SEAT May et al. [2019], and CEAT Guo and Caliskan [2020]. However, subsequent studies have revealed that biases in embedding spaces have limited correlations with biases in downstream tasks Cabello et al. [2023], Cao et al. [2022], Goldfarb-Tarrant et al. [2020], Orgad and Belinkov [2022], Orgad et al. [2022], Steed et al. [2022]. As a result, the research community has shifted its attention to probability-based metrics, such as DisCo Webster et al. [2020], CrowdS-Pairs Scores Nangia et al. [2020], and ICAT score Nadeem et al. [2020].\nDisCo Webster et al. [2020] calculates the probability score by masking a word in a sentence and asking a masked language model to fill in the blank. CrowdS-Pairs Nangia et al. [2020] and ICAT Scores Nadeem et al. [2020] work by giving language model a pair of sentences - one with stereotype and one with anti-stereotype - and then evaluates the model's preference of one sentence over other by using the probability generated by the model. The bias is then calculated by averaging the number of stereotypical and anit-stereotypical sentences preferred by the model, which should be equal in case of an ideal model. However Blodgett et al. [2021] found that this probability-based method of comparing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences have limitations as indicators of fairness, as they may not accurately capture a model's tendency to produce stereotypical outputs and can be influenced by the definition of stereotypes and anti-stereotypes in the evaluation dataset. While these metrics work relatively well compared to embedding-based metrics, it has become very difficult to access the probabilities from the current state-of-the-art large language models as they become increasingly proprietary and restricted to API-only access. Hence, there was a need of bias detection techniques for black-box language models, specifically using prompt-output pairs.\nOne key idea to detect bias in proprietary LLMs is to use datasets, which were originally made for detecting bias in downstream tasks using probability-based metrics, to directly give as an input prompt to LLM, and then evaluate the output. Some of these datasets are RealToxicityPrompt Gehman et al. [2020], BOLD Dhamala et al. [2021], BBQ Parrish et al. [2021] and HONEST Nozza et al. [2021]. Another key idea was of BiasTestGPT Kocielnik et al. [2023], where they used one LLM to generate dynamic prompts as inputs, and then test PLMs like BERT and GPT2 on these dynamic prompts to detect bias in them. BiasTestGPT was motivated from Stereoset Nadeem et al. [2020], and followed similar input pair, with only difference of input being generated by a LLM. While these measure were effective to elicit biases from LLMs in the beginning, the development of guardrails has rendered these approaches increasingly obsolete with LLMs denying to answer in most of the cases Wang et al. [2024]. Hence, instead of explicitly trying LLMs to generate biased outputs, Gupta et al. [2023] discovered that LLMs have implicit biases in them associated with different personas. Gupta et al. [2023] found that assigning different socio-demographic personas to LLMs impact their reasoning ability and also expose deep-seated stereotypical biases within them. Bai et al. [2024] also introduced two prompt-based measures, LLM IAT Bias and LLM Decision Bias, which where specifically designed to elicit implicit biases in LLMs, and were motivated by the Implicit Association Test for detecting biases in humans.

This characteristic enables them to generate text sequences by iteratively predicting each subsequent token based on the tokens that have been previously generated. For a given sequence of tokens $X = (x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$, the model estimates the probability distribution P(X) as a product of conditional probabilities:\n$\\displaystyle P(X) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{i-1}; \\theta)$ where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of the model.\nThe autoregressive nature of the model ensures that each token $x_i$ is generated sequentially, with the model conditioned on all preceding tokens $X_1,X_2, ..., X_{i-1}$. The underlying architecture, typically a transformer, uses self-attention mechanisms to capture the dependencies between these tokens:\n$\\displaystyle \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$"}, {"title": "3.2 Threat Modelling", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2.1 Implicit Association Test for Bias", "content": "To calculate Implicit Bias in LLMs, we use the method proposed by Bai et al. [2024], which involves a prompt template t, two sets of tokens $S_a$ and $S_b$ representing different social groups a and b, and two sets of response tokens $X_a$ and $X_b$ associated with these groups. We embed S and X in the prompt template t, e.g., \"For each word, pick a word $S_a$ or $S_b$ and write it after the word. The words are $X_1, X_2,...$ \" where $s_a$ and $s_b$ are drawn from $S_a$ and $S_b$, respectively, and the $x_i$ are words from $X_a$ and $X_b$. For example, $s_a$ and $s_b$ might be gender-associated names (e.g., Julia, Ben), and the $x_i$ might be stereotypically associated words (e.g., wedding, office).\nFrom the response a list of words $X_1, X_2,...$ each followed by either $s_a$ or $s_b$ we calculate bias as:\n$\\displaystyle \\text{Wordscore} = \\frac{N(s_a, X_a)}{N(s_a, X_a) + N(s_a, X_b)} + \\frac{N(s_b, X_b)}{N(s_b, X_a) + N(s_b, X_b)} - 1$\nwhere $N(s, X)$ is the number of words from X paired with s. Bias ranges from -1 to 1, reflecting the difference in attribute associations between groups. A maximal bias occurs when one group is perfectly associated with certain attributes. If the Bias score is positive then it's bias towards b and if it's negative then bias towards a if 0 then neurtal and we keep the value 0.

This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's implicit biases in each domain.\nIn contrast, the Decision Test datasets involve two characters from different social groups and two situations.

Bias scores were measured using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias Score and Decision Bias Score metrics, with the Average Bias Score providing a consolidated view of overall performance. The evaluation revealed significant variation in bias across models and providers, emphasizing the disparate levels of bias in large language models (LLMs). This variation ranged from a minimum of 6.17% in Google's Gemma-2-27b-it model to a maximum of 98.62% in OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. These differences reflect the impact of model architecture and training methodologies on bias, demonstrating that bias in LLMs is not uniform but varies widely based on how models are built and trained.\nMeta's Llama models Touvron et al. [2023], Team [2024], for instance, exhibited a wide range of average bias scores. The quantized version of the Llama-2-7B-Chat, Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF-8bit, demonstrated a relatively lower bias score of 35.60%, while the Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct model presented a notably higher average bias score of 88.08%.

One promising approach is the use of prompt debiasing filters, which act as a guardrail on the query and response end, serving as a simple and practical solution for mitigating bias. We plan to evaluate this strategy in future iterations of our work to assess its impact on reducing both Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and Decision Bias. Another potential avenue is to explore architectural innovations inspired by models like Google's Gemma-2, where alternating local and global attention mechanisms helped reduce bias. Incorporating such mechanisms into other models could offer insights into how structural changes can mitigate biases.\nIn addition to these methods, alignment-based techniques aimed at bias mitigation will be explored. Techniques like SAGE Kumar et al. [2024a] or rainbow teaming Samvelyan et al. [2024] offer valuable data generation approaches, while reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) Ouyang et al. [2022] or direct preference optimization (DPO) Rafailov et al. [2023] can be applied to better align models with human values, specifically targeting and addressing biased behaviors through fairness-driven fine-tuning.

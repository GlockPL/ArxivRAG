Chasparis", "Josef K\u00fcng"], "abstract": "Central to the digital transformation of the process industry are Digital Twins (DTs), virtual replicas of physical manufacturing systems that combine sensor data with sophisticated data-based or physics-based models, or a combination thereof, to tackle a variety of industrial-relevant tasks like process monitoring, predictive control or decision support. The backbone of a DT, i.e. the concrete modelling methodologies and architectural frameworks supporting these models, are complex, diverse and evolve fast, necessitating a thorough understanding of the latest state-of-the-art methods and trends to stay on top of a highly competitive market. From a research perspective, despite the high research interest in reviewing various aspects of DTs, structured literature reports specifically focusing on unravelling the utilized learning paradigms (e.g. self-supervised learning) for DT-creation in the process industry are a novel contribution in this field. This study aims to address these gaps by (1) systematically analyzing the modelling methodologies (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network, Encoder-Decoder, Hidden Markov Model) and paradigms (e.g. data-driven, physics-based, hybrid) used for DT-creation; (2) assessing the utilized learning strategies (e.g. supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised); (3) analyzing the type of modelling task (e.g. regression, classification, clustering); and (4) identifying the challenges and research gaps, as well as, discuss potential resolutions provided.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and Motivation", "content": "The number of sensors and the corresponding data produced in the process industry continuously increases. This uptrend is part of the Industry 4.0 revolution, enabling a rich source of sensor data [20], which presents an unprecedented opportunity to harness complex sensor data for enhancing operational efficiency. The rapidly evolving market demands and the necessity for quick decision-making introduce considerable challenges to industrial manufacturers [37]. Furthermore, manufacturers within the European Union are obligated to comply with energy efficiency standards [1], aiming to neutralize the carbon footprint of the production facilities till 2050. An intelligently managed and regulated production is essential to remain competitive and meet efficiency goals. The strategy of employing Digital Twins is recognized as a key enabler for this digital shift, aiming to increase competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency [18]. Rasheed et al. [28] define DT as a \"virtual representation of a physical asset or process enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision-making\". Recently, the evolution of DTs embraced cognitive capabilities, introducing Adaptive, Intelligent, and Cognitive DTs (e.g. [2]), showcasing their progression towards autonomy and intelligence.\nTracking concrete modelling methodologies, learning paradigms, and architectural designs is especially important for the latest concepts, i.e., cognitive or intelligent DTs, to help researchers and industrial practitioners adopt them more efficiently. Cognitive DTs aim to achieve elements of cognition, e.g. perception (i.e. abstracting meaningful data representations for subsequent processing), attention (i.e. focusing by intent or driven by signals on specific tasks, goals or data, e.g. focusing on certain aspects of the multi-dimensional and multi-modal high-volume and high-velocity data produced by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices), memory (i.e. working memory, episodic memory and semantic memory), learning (i.e. transforming insights from the physical Twin into generalizable knowledge for unseen scenarios), or reasoning [23]. Among the learning paradigms of machine learning models, transfer learning and self-supervised learning stand out as promising research directions for enabling cognitive DTs in the process industry. Transfer learning (TL) leverages knowledge, i.e. general representations, learned from pre-training on large-scale datasets and applies it to a target task with limited labelled data. Self-supervised learning does not rely on labelled data but instead learns the general representations from pre-text tasks like masked imputation, commonly using encoder-decoder-related structures (see [35]). Both learning paradigms have shown tremendous success in the natural language processing domain, where most of the success traces back to the paper of Vaswani et al. [33]. The used learning paradigm and modelling methodology are promising research directions for DTs in general, but specifically for the process industry since the data accumulated in such industries is commonly of high volume, variety, variability and veracity, making manual labelling for specific use cases (e.g. detecting anomalies, predicting key performance indicators, classifying process states, simulating process behaviour based on different control inputs) a time-consuming task for experts and researchers, or even impossible if the modelled process does not allow for exploring the behaviour out-of-domain, i.e. experiments outside of the \"normal\", business-critical operation."}, {"title": "1.1 Research Questions (RQs)", "content": "Guided by the preliminary findings of this review, we propose several research questions aimed at furthering the understanding of modelling methodologies and learning paradigms of DTs in the industrial sector:\nRQ 1: What are the state-of-the-art modelling methodologies, and how has their usage evolved?

Each question is explored through the lens of the findings from these studies. This section summarizes the findings and synthesizes the evidence to provide a coherent understanding of the current landscape and future directions in digital twin technologies for industrial manufacturing.\nResearch Question 1: What are the state-of-the-art modelling methodologies, and how has their usage evolved? Are Encoder-Decoder architectures and attention mechanisms on the rise, possibly signalling the adoption of transformer-like architectures to the industrial DT domain?\nThe used modelling methodologies as the basis for DT-creation in the context of process industry are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) e.g. [21],[30],[4],[26], followed by Autoencoder (AE), e.g. [22], [6], [7], [35]. Lue et al. [22] uses LSTMs in combination with Autoencoder for condition monitoring of magnesium furnace processes. The work combines data on electrical currents with segmented image features of the furnace flames. Li et al. [21] uses a customized CNN with deconvolution and convolution layers in combination with an attention layer on top to detect anomalies in the SWaT and WADI datasets. We have yet to see the adoption of state-of-the-art modelling methodologies of Large Language Models for the industrial DT-creation context. A notable exception in this context is Yan et al. [35], who uses a masked autoencoder that pre-trains in a self-supervised way using three novel pre-text tasks (inverse forecasting, coarser forecasting and anomaly forecasting). Results indicate robust performance and \"[...] may pave the way for leveraging pre-training approaches for multivariate time-series forecasting in the context of digital twins\"; however, it is crucial to understand the behaviour of such pre-training strategies and the influence on various DT-related tasks [35].\nResearch Question 2: What are the commonly utilized learning paradigms (i.e. unsupervised, supervised, semi-supervised or transfer-learning)? What is the distribution of data-driven and hybrid DT-modelling approaches? Is the self-supervised learning paradigm for generating general and transferable knowledge for various DT-related tasks already explored in the industrial DT domain?\nMost identified research items in this study use a supervised learning paradigm (e.g. [13,3,10]) to model the DT's use-case (see. Fig.2). Unsupervised learning paradigms are commonly used in anomaly or fault detection ([6,19]). Ladj et al. use a Gaussian Mixture Model to determine the classification thresholds and also integrate a \"data-knowledge closed loop system which combines a data-driven approach with a knowledge-driven approach, where expert rules are extracted and inferred in order to interpret and augment the results of data processing\" [19]. The self-supervised learning paradigm, in combination with transferring"}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we conduct a structured literature review to unravel the modelling methodologies, learning paradigms, and task-related evaluation aspects of Digital Twins in the context of the process industry. We first state the research questions, then formulate the search query and perform the search across various literature databases. We subsequently filter the resulting list based on includance and excludance rules and evaluate the full texts of the reduced list based on defined quality criteria to capture the relevancy of the analyzed papers for answering the specific research questions. The selected 31 primary papers apply DT-related modelling methodologies to various use cases in the industrial manufacturing domain. We synthesize the findings visually and textually to answer the research questions. We observe abundant research for self-supervised and transfer-learning paradigms (e.g. transfer knowledge to other DT-related tasks like prediction, simulation or anomaly detection). We have identified a research gap and think there is substantial potential in such learning paradigms due to the vast availability of multi-modal, high-dimensional and high-volume IIoT-data, the abundance of labelled data, and the diverse expectations and use-case scenarios of DTs in the industrial manufacturing domain."}]}

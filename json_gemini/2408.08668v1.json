Sadler"], "abstract": "With the pervasiveness of Stochastic Shortest-Path (SSP) problems in high-risk industries, such as last-mile autonomous delivery and supply chain management, robust planning algorithms are crucial for ensuring successful task completion while mitigating hazardous outcomes. Mainstream chance-constrained incremental sampling techniques for solving SSP problems tend to be overly conservative and typically do not consider the likelihood of undesirable tail events. We propose an alternative risk-aware approach inspired by the asymptotically-optimal Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) planning algorithm, which selects nodes along path segments with minimal Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Our motivation rests on the step-wise coherence of the CVaR risk measure and the optimal substructure of the SSP problem. Thus, optimizing with respect to the CVaR at each sampling iteration necessarily leads to an optimal path in the limit of the sample size. We validate our approach via numerical path planning experiments in a two-dimensional grid world with obstacles and stochastic path-segment lengths. Our simulation results show that incorporating risk into the tree growth process yields paths with lengths that are significantly less sensitive to variations in the noise parameter, or equivalently, paths that are more robust to environmental uncertainty. Algorithmic analyses reveal similar query time and memory space complexity to the baseline RRT* procedure, with only a marginal increase in processing time. This increase is offset by significantly lower noise sensitivity and reduced planner failure rates.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Many practical robot motion planning tasks can be recast as shortest-path optimization problems, ranging from problems in autonomous drone delivery [1] to search and rescue [2]. In the basic setting, the Stochastic Shortest-Path (SSP) planning problem involves finding a path of minimum expected length that connects two obstacle-free robot configurations in a planning environment with obstacles and some notion of uncertainty. Such uncertainty may arise from the robot's sensing [3], [4], decision-making, or actuation modules [5], [6]. Furthermore, many established techniques for finding shortest paths such as graph search via Dijkstra's or the A* algorithm or sampling-based algorithms like the Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm [7] and probabilistic roadmaps [8] are fundamentally non-robust. The foregoing challenges thus provide motivation for an inquiry into the design of robust shortest-path planning algorithms that consider some form of uncertainty in the planning procedure and return adequately-adjusted plans.\nIn the deterministic path planning setting, the shortest- path problem can be solved efficiently, for instance, via graph-search or sampling-based algorithms, such as the asymptotically-optimal RRT (RRT*) algorithm [9]. In the stochastic case [10], [11], however, the (now) SSP problem becomes possibly intractable, so that probabilistic completeness is inevitably lost, motivating probabilistically-constrained sampling algorithms. One such class of probabilistic methods proceeds by formulating the problem as a mathematical program subject to chance constraints [3], [12], where the obstacles, the robot's states, or both are represented by variables with noise-perturbed parameters. Convex relaxations of the chance constraints generally follow such formulations to make the problem tractable. Unfortunately, such relaxations have been reported to be conservative [13], [10]. To avoid such conservatism, some studies adopt risk-sensitive methods [14], [15] that introduce risk awareness by computing paths via risk-constrained optimization, where risk is quantified by some measure, e.g., the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR).\nRisk-aware techniques take into account highly-unlikely yet probable worst-case events, and, as a consequence, hedge against these tail outcomes to an extent proportional to their probabilities. Robustness to stochasticity naturally emerges from such methods, as demonstrated in the risk-sensitive optimization literature [16], [17]. In more related work [10], the authors reformulate the SSP problem as Difference Convex Programs (DCPs) with the decision variable set as a dynamic risk functional and for Markov state transitions. Similar to our work, the authors adopt the CVaR (along with other risk measures); their method, however, relies on a convex reformulation of the SSP, a sound but needless step in our approach. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, DCPs may be challenging to implement owing to the many intricate details involved in their construction and their reliance on sophisticated optimization tools. In contrast, the modular nature of our Risk-Aware RRT* (RA-RRT*) algorithm makes it amenable to applications. Finally, unique to our work is also a discussion on the computational implications of considering risk in SSP planning as quantified by algorithmic complexity in processing time, query time, and memory space, a fundamental but mostly neglected consideration in studies focused on risk-aware SSP planning [18], [19]."}, {"title": "A.

Uncertainty Quantification & Risk Notion", "content": "Uncertainty Quantification: As remarked in Section I, the inherent stochasticity in the SSP problem stems from varied sources that typically influence the uncertainty model. For instance, localization inaccuracy may be captured via belief- based probability density functions [4] and dynamic obstacles via ambiguity sets [20]. A canonical direction is typically to assume partial or noise-corrupted environmental information [12], [3], [13], [21]. Such characterizations of uncertainty besides enabling mathematical precision are also of immediate practical relevance due to their ease of implementation. These reasons motivate our adoption of this particular uncertainty class. Specifically, we take the length of the $k$th path segment to be given by the following expression\n$L_k = c + \\epsilon_k, \\ \\ \\epsilon_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{c_k}^2),$    (2)"}, {"title": "C.

Mathematically, it is defined as\n$\\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\ | \\ Y > \\text{VaR}_{\\alpha}(Y)]$   (4a)\n$= \\inf_{z} \\{z + \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\mathbb{E}[(Y-z)^+]\\}$  (4b)\n$= \\inf_{z} \\{z + \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\int_{z}^{+\\infty} y dy\\}$   (4c)\nwhere $[*]^+ := \\text{max}(*,0)$, and $z = \\text{VaR}_{\\alpha}(Y)$ is the $\\alpha$- quantile of $Y$'s distribution, given by\n$\\text{VaR}_{\\alpha}(Y) = \\inf \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{R} \\ | \\ \\mathbb{P}(Y \\leq z) \\geq \\alpha \\}.$     (5)\nIn our current setting where the random variable of interest ($L_k$) is normally distributed, the VaR$\\alpha$ is given as\n$\\text{VaR}_{\\alpha}(L_k) = F_{L_k}^{-1}(\\alpha).$  (6)\nIn (6), $F_{L_k}^{-1}(\\alpha)$ is the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $L_k$ evaluated at $\\alpha$, which we can write (from (3a)) as\n$F_{L_k}^{-1}(\\alpha) = c + \\zeta(\\alpha) \\sigma_{c_k},$  (7)\nwith $\\zeta(\\alpha) = \\sqrt{2} \\text{erf}^{-1}(2\\alpha - 1)$, and where $\\text{erf}(z) = (2/\\sqrt{\\pi}) \\int_0^z e^{-t^2} dt$ is the standard error function.

ROBUST SSP PLANNING VIA RISK-SENSITIVE RRT*", "content": "A. SSP Planning with CVaR Criteria\nHaving discussed the calculation of the CVaR, we will now state a modified version of Problem 1, with the objective defined in terms of the CVaR. We first define the worst-case path length, which we will invoke in the modified problem.\nDefinition 3 (Worst-Case Path Length): We define the worst- case path length (denoted as $L_{\\text{worst}}$) as the expected sum of the lengths of all path segments in $p$ under the maximum noise variance. Formally, we can define $L_{\\text{worst}}$ as $\\underset{\\theta}{\\text{sup}} \\ \\mathbb{E}[L]$.\nTo re-express $L_{\\text{worst}}$ in terms of the CVaR, we apply the following dual representation of the CVaR (see [25])\n$\\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}(Y) = \\underset{\\mathbb{P}_Y \\in \\Pi_Y}{\\text{sup}} \\ \\mathbb{E}[Y],$  (9)\nwhere the supremum is taken over the set, $\\Pi_Y$, of all admissible probability distributions, $\\mathbb{P}_Y$ of $Y$. With (9), we can thus rewrite $L_{\\text{worst}}$ as\n$L_{\\text{worst}} = \\underset{\\mathbb{P}_L \\in \\Pi_L}{\\text{sup}} \\ \\mathbb{E}[L] = \\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}(L),$    (10)\nwhere $\\mathbb{P}_L$ is the probability distribution of the resulting path length, and $\\Pi_L$ denotes the family of all such distributions, i.e., each member of $\\Pi_L$ characterizes an instance of $\\mathbb{P}_L$ defined by a unique noise variance. Thus, from the linearity of (conditional) expectation, under the assumption that the segment lengths are independent, and by the one-step coherence of the CVaR [10], we can write\n$L_{\\text{worst}} = \\text{CVaR}(L) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}(L_k).  (11)\nWe can now state the modified SSP problem.\nProblem 2 (Modified SSP Problem with CVaR Criterion): Assume the setting in Definitions 1 to 3. Find a path, $p$, that minimizes $L_{\\text{worst}}$ such that $x_0 = x_{\\text{start}}$ and $x_N = x_{\\text{goal}}$.\nAccordingly, the solution to Problem 2 is the path $p$ that solves the following mathematical program\n$\\underset{p \\in \\mathcal{P}}{\\text{min}} J_{\\text{CVaR}}(x_{\\text{start}}, \\Omega) := \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\text{CVaR}_{\\alpha}(L_k)$  (12a)\ns.t.: $x_0 = x_{\\text{start}}, \\ x_N = x_{\\text{goal}}, \\ N \\leq N_{\\text{max}},  (12b)\n$x_k \\in X_{\\text{free}}, \\ L_k = \\ell(p[k]), \\ \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{0, N_{\\text{max}}-1}.(12c)"}, {"title": "B. Probabilistic Guarantee on the Optimal $L_{\\text{worst}}$ Value", "content": "In Proposition 1, we derive a probabilistic bound on the optimal worst-case path length, motivated by the proof of Theorem 2 in [24]. We begin by deriving an expression for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in our present context via the following lemma. As we will show, the KL divergence allows us to reason about the expected optimal worst-case path length through appropriate concentration inequalities\u2074.\nLemma 1: Let $L_{\\text{worst}}^*$ denote the optimal value of $L_{\\text{worst}}$, i.e., the length of the path, $\\text{argmin}_{p \\in \\mathcal{P}} J_{\\text{CVaR}}(X_{\\text{start}}, \\Omega)$, returned by the mathematical program in Problem 2, and suppose that $\\mathbb{P}_{L_{\\text{worst}}^*}$ is its associated probability distribution, with mean, $\\mu_{L_{\\text{worst}}^*}$, and variance, $\\sigma_{L_{\\text{worst}}^*}^{2}$. Let $L_{\\text{max}}$ denote some designer-prescribed path length threshold, with associated distribution, $\\mathbb{P}_{L_{\\text{max}}}:= \\mathcal{N}(L_{\\text{max}}, \\delta^{2})$, where $\\delta > 0$ is a toler- ance on $L_{\\text{max}}^5$.

By the central limit theorem for sums, we know that in the limit as N increases, $\\mathbb{P}_{L_{\\text{worst}}^*}$ will converge in probability to a normal distribution given by $\\mathbb{P}_L = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_\\ell, \\sigma_{\\ell}^2)$, where $\\mu_\\ell := \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} c_{k}$ and $\\sigma_\\ell := \\sigma_{\\epsilon_\\mathcal{N}} \\sqrt{N}$.

Our algorithm differs from the RRT* algorithm in two ways. First, in the generation of the set of nearby nodes (line 11), connections to kn nearest neighbors are sought. The other difference is in the RA-RRT* algorithm's node selection process that introduces VaR\u03b1 and CVaR\u03b1 computation steps (lines 15 and 16 of Algorithm 1) prior to the COLLISIONFREE sub-procedure. With this background and assuming the sorting algorithm for each sorting-dependent quantity (e.g., VaR\u03b1, CVaR\u03b1, min, etc.) is the merge sort algorithm, we can affirm the following:\ni. The RA-RRT* algorithm is linear in query time, since it is a single-query algorithm like the RRT*.\nii. The RA-RRT* algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), i.e., it is linear-space, since only the path is saved in memory for single-query access.\niii.

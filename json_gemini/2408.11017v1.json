Elections are held biennially to fill the positions on this committee. Numerous residents, each with their own platform and priorities for the town's development, step forward as candidates for the election to this advisory committee. Voters from different neighborhoods and demographics then go to the polls to elect members of this committee, to make decisions on their behalf.\nBetween election cycles, due to varying campaign performances and evolving community concerns, some voters change their preferences over the candidates. While the voting rule to be used to select the advisory committee is fixed by the bylaws, it often results in multiple tied committees, i.e., it does not fully determine the election outcome. There are many ways to break these ties; in particular, one may want to maintain contiguity by prioritizing committees that have a substantial overlap with the previous committee, so as to build on the existing expertise and maintain stability, while remaining representative of the population's preferences.\nThis problem can be viewed through the lens of multiwinner temporal voting, a natural temporal extension of the well-studied multiwinner voting model (see the taxonomy of Boehmer and Niedermeier [2] and a survey by Elkind et al. [20]). In multiwinner temporal elections, a set of voters have dynamic preferences over a set of candidates, and we want to elect a committee at each timestep. In this work, we seek to study, given a voting rule, how winning committees adapt to changes in the voters' preferences in situations where it is undesirable to replace many committee members at once.\nOur Contributions We consider two-stage elections that use a fixed voting rule to select a winning committee at each stage; the voters have approval preferences that may evolve between the stages. When the first-stage committee is elected, the second-stage preferences are not yet known. Hence, a winning committee is chosen arbitrarily from the committees tied for winning. In the second stage, the goal is to identify a committee that wins under the new preferences, yet has as much overlap as possible with the first-stage committee.\nWe consider this problem for the well-known class of Thiele rules [33] (this class includes, in particular, Approval Voting (AV) [4], Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) [42], and the Chamberlin-Courant rule (CCAV) [11]) and their greedy variants. In Section 3, we present a full complexity classification of our decision problem for Thiele rules. In particular, we obtain a dichotomy: the decision version of our problem is in P for Approval Voting (AV) (Section 3.1), and coNP-hard for all Thiele rules other than AV (Section 3.2 and Section 3.3). We then extend this dichotomy to all greedy Thiele rules (Section 4); surprisingly, our problem remains hard for all rules other than AV, even though under greedy Thiele rules, computing a single winning committee is computationally tractable. To complement our hardness results, we provide parameterized complexity results for a selection of natural parameters and their combinations (Section 5). Finally, we use experiments to obtain quantitative results (Section 6): we measure the amount of change in the committees as a function of change in voters' preferences, and investigate the role of ties. In particular, our experiments show that simply breaking ties lexicographically is far from optimal with respect to the contiguity objective, thereby justifying our theoretical analysis.\nAll missing proofs and additional experimental results can be found in the appendix.\nRelated Work Our analysis extends the line of work initiated by Bredereck et al. [8], but our model and contributions differ from theirs in several key aspects: Bredereck et al. [8] study a model where (i) committees are not selected from the set of winning committees output by a voting rule, but need to satisfy a lower bound on their score (via a single non-transferable vote committee scoring rule), (ii) the subsequent committees need not be of the same size, and (iii) voters preferences in all stages are known at the start. In contrast, we consider a large class of popular voting rules and require each selected committee to win under a given rule for a fixed committee size; moreover, our model is more realistic in that it does not assume that the second-stage preferences are known initially.\nOther papers in this vein include the work of Bredereck et al. [6], that considered maximizing the changes made to a committee (the \"revolutionary\" setting) to find diverse committees, and the paper by"}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "Given a logical expression \\(\\phi\\), we use the Iverson bracket notation \\[\\phi\\] to denote the evaluation of that expression: \\[\\phi\\] = 1 if \\(\\phi\\) is true and \\[\\phi\\] = 0 otherwise. We assume familiarity with the basics of classic complexity theory [38] and parameterized complexity [23, 37].\nElections Let \\(C = \\{c_1, ..., c_m \\}\\) be a set of \\(m\\) candidates, and let \\(N = \\{1, ..., n\\}\\) be a set of \\(n\\) voters. Each voter \\(i \\in N\\) has approval preferences over candidates in \\(C\\), captured by a ballot \\(v_i \\subseteq C\\); we require that \\(v_i \\neq \\emptyset\\). Let \\(V = (v_1, ..., v_n)\\). We refer to the pair \\((C, V)\\) as an election.\nRules A multiwinner voting rule \\(R\\) maps an election \\(E = (C, V)\\) and an integer \\(k \\in [|C|]\\) to a non-empty family of sets \\(R(E, k)\\), where each set in \\(R(E, k)\\) is a size-\\(k\\) subset of \\(C\\). The sets in \\(R(E, k)\\) are called the winning committees for \\(E\\) under \\(R\\).\nIn this work, we focus on a well-studied class of voting rules known as Thiele rules [30, 33], and their greedy variants. We say that a function \\(\\lambda : \\mathbb{N}^+ \\rightarrow [0, 1]\\) is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) function if \\(\\lambda(1) = 1\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) is non-increasing, i.e. for all \\(i, j \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) it holds that \\(i > j\\) implies \\(\\lambda(i) \\leq \\lambda(j)\\) [22]. In what follows, we assume that all OWA functions \\(\\lambda\\) we consider take values in \\(\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1]\\) and are polynomial-time computable. Each OWA function \\(\\lambda\\) defines a Thiele rule \\(R_\\lambda\\) as follows. Given an election \\(E = (C, V)\\) and a committee size \\(k \\in [|C|]\\), the \\(\\lambda\\)-score of a candidate set \\(S \\subseteq C\\) in \\(E\\) is defined by: \\(\\lambda\\)-score\\((S) = \\sum_{i \\in N} (\\sum_{j=1}^{|S \\cap v_i|} \\lambda(j))\\). The rule \\(R_\\lambda\\) then outputs all size-\\(k\\) subsets of \\(C\\) with the maximum \\(\\lambda\\)-score: \\(R_\\lambda(E, k) = \\operatorname{argmax}\\{\\lambda\\)-score\\((S) | S \\in \\binom{C}{k}\\}\\). We omit \\(\\lambda\\) and/or \\(E\\) whenever it is clear from the context. This framework captures many well-known voting rules. Specifically,\n*   \\(\\lambda(i) = 1\\) for all \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) corresponds to the Approval Voting (AV) rule [4];\n*   \\(\\lambda(i) = 1/i\\) for all \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) corresponds to the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule [42]; and\n*   \\(\\lambda(i) = [i = 1]\\) for all \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}^+\\) corresponds to the Chamberlin-Courant Approval Voting (CCAV) rule [11].\nThe AV rule is appropriate when the aim is to select a group of individually excellent candidates, whereas CCAV aims to represent as many voters as possible; the PAV rule provides strong proportional representation guarantees [33]. We say that an OWA function \\(\\lambda\\) (and the associated Thiele rule \\(R_\\lambda\\)) is unit-decreasing if \\(\\lambda(1) = 1 > \\lambda(2)\\). AV is not unit-decreasing, whereas PAV and CCAV are. Intuitively, unit-decreasing rules capture that the voters' marginal utility from having an additional representative in the winning committee is lower than their utility from being represented at all.\nSince committees under both PAV and CCAV are NP-hard to compute [1, 39, 43], there exist greedy approximation variants of these rules, which are based on the notion of marginal contributions. Given an election \\(E = (C, V)\\), a subset \\(S \\subseteq C\\) of candidates and an OWA function \\(\\lambda\\), we define the marginal contribution (or points) of a candidate \\(c \\in C \\setminus S\\) with respect to \\(S\\) as \\(\\lambda\\)-score\\((S \\cup \\{c\\}) - \\lambda\\)-score\\((S)\\). Then, the greedy variant of a Thiele rule \\(R_\\lambda\\), which we denote by Greedy-\\(R_\\lambda\\), outputs all committees that can be obtained by the following iterative procedure: start with an empty committee \\(S\\) and perform \\(k\\) iterations; at each iteration, add a candidate in \\(C \\setminus S\\) with maximum marginal contribution to \\(S\\) under \\(\\lambda\\) (at each iteration there may be multiple candidates with maximum marginal contribution to the current committee; a committee is in the output of the rule if it can be obtained by some way of breaking these ties at each iteration). Clearly, a committee in the output of Greedy-\\(R_\\lambda\\) can be computed in polynomial time (recall that we assume that \\(\\lambda\\) itself is polynomial-time computable). We note that Greedy-AV is equivalent to AV; however, other Thiele rules differ from their greedy variants.\nDistances Given two committees \\(S, S' \\subseteq C\\) of equal size \\(k\\), we define the distance between \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) as \\(\\operatorname{dist}(S, S') = k - |S \\cap S'|\\). To this end, we define elementary ADD and REMOVE operations on elections. An ADD operation adds a previously unapproved candidate to the ballot of a single voter. A REMOVE operation removes a single candidate from a single voter's ballot. Then, the distance between two elections \\(E\\) and \\(E'\\), denoted Dist\\((E, E')\\), is defined as the length of the shortest sequence of ADD and REMOVE operations that transforms \\(E\\) into \\(E'\\) (and \\(+\\infty\\) if \\(E\\) cannot be transformed into \\(E'\\) using these two operations).\nDecision Problem We are now ready to present the family of decision problems we are interested in.\nRESILIENT COMMITTEE ELECTIONS (R-RCE):\nInput: Elections \\(E = (C, V)\\) and \\(E' = (C, V')\\) over the same set of candidates \\(C\\), a committee size \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), a winning committee \\(S \\in R(E, k)\\), and a distance bound \\(\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\nQuestion: Does there exist a committee \\(S' \\in R(E', k)\\) such that \\(\\operatorname{dist}(S, S') \\leq \\ell\\)?"}, {"title": "3 A Dichotomy for Thiele Rules", "content": "We present a full complexity classification of RCE for Thiele rules.

AV-RCE admits a polynomial-time algorithm.\nProof. Consider two elections \\(E = (C, V)\\) and \\(E' = (C, V')\\) over a candidate set \\(C = \\{c_1,..., c_m\\}\\). Let \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) be the committee size and let \\(S \\in R(E, k)\\) be a winning committee for \\(E\\). For each \\(c_i \\in C\\), let \\(s(c_i)\\) be the approval score of \\(c_i\\) in \\(E'\\). Without loss of generality, assume that \\(s(c_1) \\geq ... \\geq s(c_m)\\).

Our proof also shows parameterized hardness with respect to the committee size, and applies even to the case where \\(E\\) and \\(E'\\) differ only in a single approval.\nTheorem 3.2.

We reduce from INDEPENDENT SET (IS). An instance of IS is a pair \\((G, \\kappa)\\), where \\(G = (V, E)\\) is an arbitrary graph and \\(\\kappa \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) is a non-negative integer. It is a yes-instance if there is an independent set of size \\(\\kappa\\) in \\(G\\), and a no-instance otherwise.

In election \\(E\\), the set of candidates \\(C\\) is defined as \\(C_V \\cup D\\), where \\(C_V = \\{c_w | w \\in V\\}\\) is the set of vertex candidates, and \\(D\\) is a set of \\(k\\) dummy candidates. Let \\(\\alpha = \\lambda(2)\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the underlying OWA function of \\(R\\), and let\n\\[t = \\frac{2}{1-\\alpha}.\\]\nWe introduce the following four voter groups in election \\(E\\).\n1.  For every edge \\(\\{u, w\\} \\in E\\), there are \\(t\\) edge voters who approve the vertex candidates \\(c_u\\) and \\(c_w\\).\n2.  For every vertex \\(w \\in V\\), there are \\((v - \\deg(w)) t\\) voters who approve the vertex candidate \\(c_w\\).\n3.  For every pair of candidates \\(d \\in D\\) and \\(c_w \\in C_V\\), there are \\(t\\) voters who approve both \\(d\\) and \\(c_w\\).\n4.  For every dummy candidate \\(d \\in D\\), there are \\(kt\\) voters who approve \\(d\\).\nNote that every candidate is approved by exactly \\((v + k) t\\) voters. Since no two dummy candidates are approved by the same voter, the size-\\(k\\) committee \\(D\\) has the maximum possible score of \\(k \\cdot (v + k) t\\) in election \\(E\\). Therefore, \\(D \\in R(E, k)\\).\nNow, consider an election \\(E' = (C, V')\\), where \\(V'\\) is obtained by picking an arbitrary candidate \\(d^* \\in D\\) and an arbitrary voter \\(i\\) who approves \\(d^*\\) and some vertex candidate, and removing \\(d^*\\) from \\(i\\)'s ballot. Then the score of the committee \\(D\\) in \\(E'\\) is \\(k \\cdot (v + k)t - 1\\). We will show that \\(D\\) wins in election \\(E'\\) if and only if there is no size-\\(\\kappa\\) independent set in graph \\(G\\) and that otherwise, every winning committee \\(S \\in R(E', k)\\) is entirely disjoint from \\(D\\), i.e., \\(D \\cap S = \\emptyset\\). Note that this generalizes the statement to all values of \\(\\ell \\in [k - 1]\\).\n(\\(\\rightarrow\\)) Assume that there is an independent set \\(I\\) of size \\(\\kappa\\) in graph \\(G\\), and let \\(S_1 = \\{c_w | w \\in I\\}\\) be the size-\\(k\\) committee that corresponds to the vertices in \\(I\\). Since \\(I\\) is an independent set, no two candidates in \\(S_1\\) are approved by the same voter, so the score of \\(S_1\\) in \\(E'\\) is \\(k \\cdot (v + k) t\\). Moreover, \\(S_1 \\cap D = \\emptyset\\).

However, then there are \\(t\\) voters who approve both \\(d\\) and \\(c\\). Therefore, the score of \\(S\\) is at most \\(k \\cdot (v + k) \\cdot t - (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot t\\). Now, since \\(R\\) is a unit-decreasing Thiele rule, we have \\(\\alpha < 1\\) and, hence, score\\((S_1, E') > \\text{score}(S, E')\\).

Similarly, if \\(S \\cap D = \\emptyset\\), we have \\(S \\subseteq C_V\\). Since \\(S\\) does not correspond to an independent set, there are at least \\(t\\) edge voters who approve two candidates in \\(S\\). Therefore, in either case, the score of \\(S\\) is at most \\(k \\cdot (v + k) \\cdot t - (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot t\\).

This is despite greedy Thiele rules having better computational properties than Thiele rules: e.g., it is easy to find a winning committee under a greedy Thiele rule.\nHowever, our argument becomes much more involved. Again, we start by establishing a hardness result for unit-decreasing rules. Our hardness reduction for this class of rules proceeds in two steps. We first define a new problem, which we call CANDIDATE INCLUSION (CI) and show it to be NP-hard for greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rules. We then give a reduction from CI to RCE.\nFor a fixed voting rule \\(R\\), an instance of R-CI comprises of an election \\(E = (C, V)\\), a committee size \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and a set of candidates \\(P \\subseteq C\\); it is a yes-instance if there exists a winning committee \\(S \\in R(E, k)\\) such that \\(P \\subseteq S\\), and a no-instance otherwise.

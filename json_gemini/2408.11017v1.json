Elections are held biennially to fill the positions on this committee. Numerous residents, each with their own platform and priorities for the town's development, step forward as candidates for the election to this advisory committee. Voters from different neighborhoods and demographics then go to the polls to elect members of this committee, to make decisions on their behalf.\nBetween election cycles, due to varying campaign performances and evolving community concerns, some voters change their preferences over the candidates. While the voting rule to be used to select the advisory committee is fixed by the bylaws, it often results in multiple tied committees, i.e., it does not fully determine the election outcome. There are many ways to break these ties; in particular, one may want to maintain contiguity by prioritizing committees that have a substantial overlap with the previous committee, so as to build on the existing expertise and maintain stability, while remaining representative of the population's preferences.\nThis problem can be viewed through the lens of multiwinner temporal voting, a natural temporal extension of the well-studied multiwinner voting model (see the taxonomy of Boehmer and Niedermeier [2] and a survey by Elkind et al. [20]). In multiwinner temporal elections, a set of voters have dynamic preferences over a set of candidates, and we want to elect a committee at each timestep. In this work, we seek to study, given a voting rule, how winning committees adapt to changes in the voters' preferences in situations where it is undesirable to replace many committee members at once.\nOur Contributions We consider two-stage elections that use a fixed voting rule to select a winning committee at each stage; the voters have approval preferences that may evolve between the stages. When the first-stage committee is elected, the second-stage preferences are not yet known. Hence, a winning committee is chosen arbitrarily from the committees tied for winning. In the second stage, the goal is to identify a committee that wins under the new preferences, yet has as much overlap as possible with the first-stage committee.\nWe consider this problem for the well-known class of Thiele rules [33] (this class includes, in particular, Approval Voting (AV) [4], Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) [42], and the Chamberlin-Courant rule (CCAV) [11]) and their greedy variants. In Section 3, we present a full complexity classification of our decision problem for Thiele rules. In particular, we obtain a dichotomy: the decision version of our problem is in P for Approval Voting (AV) (Section 3.1), and coNP-hard for all Thiele rules other than AV (Section 3.2 and Section 3.3). We then extend this dichotomy to all greedy Thiele rules (Section 4); surprisingly, our problem remains hard for all rules other than AV, even though under greedy Thiele rules, computing a single winning committee is computationally tractable. To complement our hardness results, we provide parameterized complexity results for a selection of natural parameters and their combinations (Section 5). Finally, we use experiments to obtain quantitative results (Section 6): we measure the amount of change in the committees as a function of change in voters' preferences, and investigate the role of ties. In particular, our experiments show that simply breaking ties lexicographically is far from optimal with respect to the contiguity objective, thereby justifying our theoretical analysis.\nAll missing proofs and additional experimental results can be found in the appendix."}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "Given a logical expression \u03c6, we use the Iverson bracket notation [\u03c6] to denote the evaluation of that expression: [\u03c6] = 1 if \u03c6 is true and [\u03c6] = 0 otherwise. We assume familiarity with the basics of classic complexity theory [38] and parameterized complexity [23, 37].\nElections Let C = {c_1, ..., c_m} be a set of m candidates, and let N = {1, ..., n} be a set of n voters. Each voter i \u2208 N has approval preferences over candidates in C, captured by a ballot v_i \u2286 C; we require that v_i \u2260 \u00d8. Let V = (v_1,..., v_n). We refer to the pair (C, V) as an election.\nRules A multiwinner voting rule R maps an election E = (C, V) and an integer k \u2208 [|C|] to a non-empty family of sets R(E, k), where each set in R(E, k) is a size-k subset of C. The sets in R(E, k) are called the winning committees for E under R.\nIn this work, we focus on a well-studied class of voting rules known as Thiele rules [30, 33], and their greedy variants. We say that a function \u03bb: N+ \u2192 [0, 1] is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) function if \u03bb(1) = 1 and \u03bb is non-increasing, i.e. for all i, j \u2208 N+ it holds that i > j implies \u03bb(i) \u2264 \u03bb(j) [22]. In what follows, we assume that all OWA functions \u03bb we consider take values in Q \u2229 [0, 1] and are polynomial-time computable. Each OWA function \u03bb defines a Thiele rule R_\u03bb as follows. Given an election E = (C, V) and a committee size k \u2208 [|C|], the \u03bb-score of a candidate set S \u2286 C in E is defined by: \u03bb-score_E(S) = \\sum_{i\u2208N} (\\sum_{j=1}^{|S \u2229 v_i|} \u03bb(j)). The rule R_\u03bb then outputs all size-k subsets of C with the maximum \u03bb-score: R_\u03bb(E,k) = argmax_{S\u2208(C choose k)} {\u03bb-score(S) | S \u2208 (C choose k)}. We omit \u03bb and/or E whenever it is clear from the context. This framework captures many well-known voting rules. Specifically,\n*   \u03bb(i) = 1 for all i \u2208 N+ corresponds to the Approval Voting (AV) rule [4];\n*   \u03bb(i) = 1/i for all i \u2208 N+ corresponds to the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule [42]; and\n*   \u03bb(i) = [i = 1] for all i \u2208 N+ corresponds to the Chamberlin-Courant Approval Voting (CCAV) rule [11].\nThe AV rule is appropriate when the aim is to select a group of individually excellent candidates, whereas CCAV aims to represent as many voters as possible; the PAV rule provides strong proportional representation guarantees [33]. We say that an OWA function \u03bb (and the associated Thiele rule R_\u03bb) is unit-decreasing if \u03bb(1) = 1 > \u03bb(2). AV is not unit-decreasing, whereas PAV and CCAV are. Intuitively, unit-decreasing rules capture that the voters' marginal utility from having an additional representative in the winning committee is lower than their utility from being represented at all.\nSince committees under both PAV and CCAV are NP-hard to compute [1, 39, 43], there exist greedy approximation variants of these rules, which are based on the notion of marginal contributions. Given an election E = (C, V), a subset S \u2286 C of candidates and an OWA function \u03bb, we define the marginal contribution (or points) of a candidate c \u2208 C\\S with respect to S as \u03bb-score(S \u222a {c}) \u2013 \u03bb-score(S). Then, the greedy variant of a Thiele rule R_\u03bb, which we denote by Greedy-R_\u03bb, outputs all committees that can be obtained by the following iterative procedure: start with an empty committee S and perform k iterations; at each iteration, add a candidate in C\\S with maximum marginal contribution to S under \u03bb (at each iteration there may be multiple candidates with maximum marginal contribution to the current committee; a committee is in the output of the rule if it can be obtained by some way of breaking these ties at each iteration). Clearly, a committee in the output of Greedy-R_\u03bb can be computed in polynomial time (recall that we assume that \u03bb itself is polynomial-time computable). We note that Greedy-AV is equivalent to AV; however, other Thiele rules differ from their greedy variants.\nDistances Given two committees S, S' \u2286 C of equal size k, we define the distance between S and S' as dist(S, S') = k \u2212 |S \u2229 S'|. To this end, we define elementary ADD and REMOVE operations on elections. An ADD operation adds a previously unapproved candidate to the ballot of a single voter. A REMOVE operation removes a single candidate from a single voter's ballot. Then, the distance between two elections E and E', denoted Dist(E, E'), is defined as the length of the shortest sequence of ADD and REMOVE operations that transforms E into E' (and +\u221e if E cannot be transformed into E' using these two operations).\nDecision Problem We are now ready to present the family of decision problems we are interested in.\n**RESILIENT COMMITTEE ELECTIONS (R-RCE):**\nInput: Elections E = (C, V) and E' = (C, V') over the same set of candidates C, a committee size k \u2208 N, a winning committee S \u2208 R(E, k), and a distance bound l \u2208 N.\nQuestion: Does there exist a committee S' \u2208 R(E', k) such that dist(S, S') \u2264 l?"}, {"title": "A Dichotomy for Thiele Rules", "content": "We present a full complexity classification of RCE for Thiele rules.

AV-RCE admits a polynomial-time algorithm.\nProof. Consider two elections E = (C, V) and E' = (C, V') over a candidate set C = {c_1,..., c_m}. Let k \u2208 N be the committee size and let S \u2208 R(E, k) be a winning committee for E. For each c \u2208 C, let s(c) be the approval score of c in E'. Without loss of generality, assume that s(c_1) \u2265 ... \u2265 s(c_m).

A winning committee under AV in E' must include all of the candidates in C_{above} and k - |C_{above}| candidates from C_{equal}; by construction, 0 < k - |C_{above}| \u2264 |C_{equal}|. Thus, we construct a committee S^* by first including all candidates from C_{above} as well as min{k - |C_{above}|, |C_{equal} \u2229 S|} candidates from C_{equal} \\ S. We then fill the committee with arbitrary candidates from C_{equal}. Obviously, the resulting committee S^* wins in election E' under AV. Furthermore, our approach ensures that S^* contains as many candidates from S as possible. Finally, we check if dist(S, S^*) \u2264 l. As all steps are computable in polynomial time, this concludes the proof."}, {"title": "Hardness for Unit-Decreasing Thiele Rules", "content": "We will now present our hardness result for unit-decreasing Thiele rules. Our proof also shows parameterized hardness with respect to the committee size, and applies even to the case where E and E' differ only in a single approval.\nTheorem 3.2. For every unit-decreasing Thiele rule R and every fixed value of l \u2208 [k - 1] the problem R-RCE is coNP-hard and coW[1]-hard when parameterized by the committee size k, even if every voter approves at most two candidates, and even if Dist(E, E') = 1.\nProof. We reduce from INDEPENDENT SET (IS). An instance of IS is a pair (G, \u03ba), where G = (V,E) is an arbitrary graph and \u03ba \u2208 N is a non-negative integer. It is a yes-instance if there is an independent set of size \u03ba in G, and a no-instance otherwise. IS is NP-hard and W[1]-hard when parameterized by the solution size \u03ba.\nGiven an instance (G, \u03ba) of IS where G = (V,E) and |V| = v, we construct an instance of R-RCE as follows.\nWe set committee size k to \u03ba. In election E, the set of candidates C is defined as C_V \u222a D, where C_V = {c_w | w \u2208 V} is the set of vertex candidates, and D is a set of k dummy candidates. Let \u03b1 = \u03bb(2), where \u03bb is the underlying OWA function of R, and let\nt = \\frac{2}{1-\u03b1}\nWe introduce the following four voter groups in election E.\n1.  For every edge {u, w} \u2208 E, there are t edge voters who approve the vertex candidates c_u and c_w.\n2.  For every vertex w \u2208 V, there are (v \u2013 deg(w)) \u00b7 t voters who approve the vertex candidate c_w.\n3.  For every pair of candidates d \u2208 D and c_w \u2208 C_V, there are t voters who approve both d and c_w.\n4.  For every dummy candidate d \u2208 D, there are k \u00b7 t voters who approve d.\nNote that every candidate is approved by exactly (v + k) \u00b7 t voters. Since no two dummy candidates are approved by the same voter, the size-k committee D has the maximum possible score of k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t in election E. Therefore, D \u2208 R(E, k).\nNow, consider an election E' = (C, V'), where V' is obtained by picking an arbitrary candidate d^* \u2208 D and an arbitrary voter i who approves d^* and some vertex candidate, and removing d^* from i's ballot. Then the score of the committee D in E' is k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 1. We will show that D wins in election E' if and only if there is no size-k independent set in graph G and that otherwise, every winning committee S \u2208 R(E', k) is entirely disjoint from D, i.e., D \u2229 S = \u2205. Note that this generalizes the statement to all values of l \u2208 [k - 1].\n(\u2192) Assume that there is an independent set I of size \u03ba in graph G, and let S_1 = {c_w | w \u2208 I} be the size-k committee that corresponds to the vertices in I. Since I is an independent set, no two candidates in S_1 are approved by the same voter, so the score of S_1 in E' is \u03ba \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t. Moreover, S_1 \u2229 D = \u2205. Assume for contradiction that there is a committee S \u2208 R(E', k) such that S \u2229 D \u2260 \u2205, i.e., there is a candidate d \u2208 S \u2229 D. Since score(D, E') = k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 1, it must hold that S \u2260 D, i.e., there is a candidate c \u2208 S \u2229 C_V. However, then there are t voters who approve both d and c. Therefore, the score of S is at most k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 t. Now, since R is a unit-decreasing Thiele rule, we have \u03b1 < 1 and, hence, score(S_1, E') > score(S, E'). Thus, S \u2209 R(E', k), a contradiction.\n(\u2190) Assume that there is no independent set I of size \u03ba in G. Assume for contradiction that there is a size-k committee S \u2286 C such that score(S, E') > score(D, E'), i.e., D \u2209 R(E', k). Then S \u2229 C_V \u2260 \u2205; let c be some candidate in S \u2229 C_V. Now, if S \u2229 D \u2260 \u2205, there exists a candidate d \u2208 S, and t voters who approve both c and d. Similarly, if S \u2229 D = \u2205, we have S \u2286 C_V. Since S does not correspond to an independent set, there are at least t edge voters who approve two candidates in S. Therefore, in either case, the score of S is at most k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 t. But then t = \\frac{2}{1-\u03b1} implies that\nthe quantity score(D, E') \u2013 score(S, E') = (k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 1) \u2212 (k \u00b7 (v + k) \u00b7 t \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 t) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u00b7 t \u2212 1 = (1 - \u03b1) \u00b7 \\frac{2}{1-\u03b1} - 1 \u2265 1,\ni.e., D has a strictly higher score than S in E', a contradiction.\nNote that the committee size k in our constructed election is equal to the solution size of the given IS instance. Therefore, our reduction is parameter-preserving.\nNote that we do not claim that R-RCE is coNP-complete; because in the naive guess-and-check approach, one would first guess a committee S' with a low enough distance from the original committee S, which indicates to the class NP. Then to verify that the chosen committee S' wins in the altered election, one would guess a second committee S'' and check if S'' has a higher score than S' in the altered election, which indicates to the class coNP."}, {"title": "Beyond Unit-Decreasing Thiele Rules", "content": "Consider a Thiele rule R_\u03bb that is not unit-decreasing.

This is despite greedy Thiele rules having better computational properties than Thiele rules: e.g., it is easy to find a winning committee under a greedy Thiele rule. However, our argument becomes much more involved. Again, we start by establishing a hardness result for unit-decreasing rules. Our hardness reduction for this class of rules proceeds in two steps. We first define a new problem, which we call CANDIDATE INCLUSION (CI) and show it to be NP-hard for greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rules. We then give a reduction from CI to RCE.\nFor a fixed voting rule R, an instance of R-CI comprises of an election E = (C, V), a committee size k \u2208 N and a set of candidates P \u2286 C; it is a yes-instance if there exists a winning committee S \u2208 R(E, k) such that P \u2286 S, and a no-instance otherwise. This problem can be seen as a generalization of the WINNER CHECKING (WC) problem studied by Aziz et al. [1], i.e., the task of checking whether a given committee is among the winners in a given election. We provide a high-level idea of our hardness proof of CI, and defer the full proof (which is quite technical) to the appendix.\nProposition 4.1. For every greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rule Greedy-R and size of |P| \u2208 [1, k], Greedy-R-CI is NP-hard.\nProof idea. Fix a greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rule Greedy-R. We reduce from RESTRICTED EXACT COVER BY THREE SETS (RX3C) [27], which is a variant of EXACT COVER BY THREE SETS [24]. An instance of RX3C comprises of a finite set of elements U = {u_1,..., u_{3h}} and a family M = {M_1,..., M_{3h}} of size-3 subsets of U such that every element of U belongs to exactly three sets in M; it is a yes-instance if there is a selection of exactly h sets from M whose union is U, and a no-instance otherwise.\nGiven an instance (U, M) of RX3C, we construct an instance of Greedy-R-CI with an election E, a subset P of candidates, and a committee size k. Our set of candidates contains a set candidate for every set in M, as well as three candidates p, d, and x. We set the committee size k to 3h + 2. We construct voters so that x is chosen in the first iteration, followed by a selection of h set candidates. Then, in the (h + 1)-th iteration, we reach the critical point where candidate p can be selected if and only if the previously selected set candidates correspond to an exact cover of U, and otherwise, candidate d is selected as a default. In the final 2h iterations, all remaining set candidates are selected. The set P consists of candidate p and an arbitrary number of set candidates. Then, there is a winning committee S \u2208 Greedy-R(E, k) with P \u2286 S if and only if U can be covered with h sets from M.\nBy reducing CI to RCE, we establish the following:\nTheorem 4.2. For every greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rule Greedy-R_\u03bb and for every distance between committees l \u2208 [k \u2013 1], Greedy-R_\u03bb-RCE is NP-hard, even if Dist(E, E') = 1.\nProof idea. We give a reduction from Greedy-R-CI to Greedy-R-RCE. Fix a greedy unit-decreasing Thiele rule Greedy-R. Given an instance (\u1ebc = (\u010c, V), P, k) of Greedy-R-CI, we construct an instance of Greedy-R-RCE as follows. We create two wrapper elections E and E' at distance of 1 from each other. In E and E', we include all candidates in \u010c and all voters in V, an additional set B of k - |P| candidates, as well as two control candidates x and y. We set the committee size k to k + 2. We construct voters in election E so that candidate x can be chosen in the first iteration. Once x is selected, all candidates in C \\ P lose sufficiently many points that they will not be selected in any of the subsequent iterations. Thus, all candidates in B \u222a P need to be chosen, before y is chosen in the final iteration. Therefore, the size-k committee S = B \u222a P \u222a {x,y} wins in election E, i.e., S \u2208 Greedy-R(E, k).\nIn contrast, we construct the voters in E' so that y must be selected in the first iteration. Once y is selected, all candidates in B lose sufficiently many points that they will not be selected in any of the subsequent iterations. Then, in the following k iterations, candidates from C must be chosen, before x is chosen in the final iteration. Thus, the intersection between S and a winning committee S' in E' can only contain x, y, and candidates in P.\nAfter y has been chosen and before x is chosen, Greedy-R operates on E' in the same way as it would on E. This implies that Greedy-R(E', k) = {\u0160 \u222a {x,y} | \u0160 \u2208 Greedy-R(\u1ebc, k)}, i.e., a committee S' is winning in E' if and only if it consists of candidates x and y and all candidates from a winning committee in E. We set the allowed difference l between committees in our RCE instance to k - |P| - 2, i.e., at least |P| + 2 candidates need to appear in both winning committees. Since x and y will always be chosen, this implies that a selection of at least |P| candidates from S need to be present in both S and S', which are exactly the candidates from P. This ensures that the given instance of Greedy-R-CI is a yes-instance if and only if our constructed Greedy-R-RCE instance is a yes-instance.\nThe above establishes hardness for all values of l \u2208 [k - 3]. Recall that Greedy-R-CI is NP-hard for every size of P \u2265 1, and we remark that the distance between committees in E and E' can be increased by 2 by setting k to k + 1. Then, under Greedy-R, y will not be chosen in the last iteration on E, and x will not be chosen in the last iteration on E'. Thus, one can verify that we obtain hardness for the complete range of l \u2208 [k - 1].\nRecall that Greedy-AV is equivalent to AV and hence Greedy-AV-RCE is polynomial-time solvable. On the other hand if \u03bb(s) = 1, \u03bb(s + 1) < 1, we can use the same construction as in the proof of Theorem 3.3, i.e., modify the proof of Theorem 4.2 by increasing the committee size by s and adding s candidates approved by all voters. We obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 4.3. Consider a greedy Thiele rule Greedy-R associated with the OWA \u03bb. If \u03bb(i) = 1 for all i \u2208 N+, then Greedy-R-RCE is polynomial-time solvable. Otherwise, it is NP-hard. The result holds for all l \u2208 [k - s], where s \u2208 N+ is the smallest number such that \u03bb(s + 1) < 1, and even if Dist(E, E') = 1.\nPreviously, we have motivated the RCE problem with settings in which it is costly to replace any member of an already implemented winning committee. In these settings, we are mostly interested in the"}, {"title": "Parameterized Complexity Results", "content": "Next, we consider RCE for Thiele rules and their greedy variants from a parameterized complexity perspective.

Thus, we cannot hope for an FPT algorithm with respect to k that works for all Thiele rules. However, R-RCE admits a simple algorithm that is XP with respect to k and FPT with respect to |C| = m.\nProposition 5.1. For every Thiele rule R the problem R-RCE is FPT in m and XP in k.\nProof. Given an R-RCE instance (E, E', S, k, l), we can go over all size-k subsets of C, evaluate their scores in E', and check if one of the committees with the maximum score is at distance at most l from S. There are (m choose k) \u2264 m^k \u2264 m^m committees to consider; for each, its R-score in E' can be computed in polynomial time.\nFurther, our problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the combined parameter n + k, where n is the number of voters. This proof, as well as some of the subsequent proofs, is based on the idea that we can partition the candidates in E' into at most 2n non-empty candidate classes, so that all candidates in each class are approved by the same voters.\nProposition 5.2.

For every greedy Thiele rule Greedy-R the problem Greedy-R-RCE is FPT in k for every fixed value of l \u2208 N, as well as FPT in m and XP in k.\nProof. Given an RCE instance (E, E', S, k, l), we guess a subset of candidates S^- \u2286 S, |S^-| \u2264 l to be replaced, and a subset of candidates S^+ \u2286 C \\ S, |S^+| = |S^-|, to replace them. Note that for S' = (S \\ S^-) \u222a S^+ we have dist(S, S') \u2264 l, and there are at most (k choose l) * (m choose k) pairs (S^-, S^+) to consider (polynomially many for constant l, and at most 2^k * m^k, as l < k). We then guess a permutation \u03c0 of S' and check if the rule Greedy-R can select the candidates in S', in the order specified by \u03c0. There are k! permutations to consider, so the bounds on the running time follow.\nJust as for Thiele rules, we combine the approach of Proposition 5.4 with the idea of partitioning candidates into classes to design an algorithm that is FPT in n + k.\nProposition 5.5. For every greedy Thiele rule Greedy-R the problem Greedy-R-RCE is FPT in n + k.\nFor Greedy-CC, we can strengthen this result from FPT in n+k to FPT in n; it remains an open problem if a similar tractability result holds for other greedy Thiele rules.\nProposition 5.6.

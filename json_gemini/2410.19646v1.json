Cancer screening in the healthy population involves an initial risk stratification step to determine the screening method and frequency, primarily to optimize resource allocation by targeting screening towards individuals who draw most benefit. For most screening programs, age and clinical risk factors such as family history are part of the initial risk stratification algorithm. In this paper, we focus on developing a blood marker-based risk stratification approach, which could be used to identify patients with elevated cancer risk to be encouraged for taking a diagnostic test or participate in a screening program. We demonstrate that the combination of simple, widely available blood tests, such as complete blood count and complete metabolic panel, could potentially be used to identify patients at risk for colorectal, liver, and lung cancers with areas under the ROC curve of 0.76, 0.85, 0.78, respectively. Furthermore, we hypothesize that such an approach could not only be used as pre-screening risk assessment for individuals but also as population health management tool, for example to better interrogate the cancer risk in certain sub-populations.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "This paper focuses on the use of multiple biomarkers for the assessment of patients, or identification of otherwise healthy individuals, who are at increased risk of cancer. With the high mortality rate associated with cancer patients, significant research has been conducted to help identify patients at higher risk, starting with identifying medical conditions that increase the risk of cancer, such as diabetes, or genetic predispositions that promote its development\u00b9. Furthermore, various screening procedures have been developed to help facilitate early diagnosis such as the Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC)\u00b2, mammography for breast cancer\u00b3, and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer\u2074. However, cancer screening rates and their uptake remains lower than desired, e.g., in the US5. While there are several factors contributing to this low uptake, one of the key factors is the lack of awareness within the general population. This is even more important to address for people who may be at increased risk and would benefit from early and/or regular screening. In other words, there is still a need for convenient tests for early detection of rapidly progressing diseases such as cancer so that intervention can start as early as possible.\nSeveral cancer risk prediction/assessment tools based on demographic, socioeconomic or blood based markers have been developed over the years, and studies have shown that cancer risk assessment algorithms could have an impact in early cancer diagnosis7. For instance, the Qcancer 10 year risk algorithm8 considers the age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, previous cancer diagnoses, family history of cancer, relevant comorbidities, and medication data for a patient and predicts the cancer risk for 11 types of cancers. Nartowt et al. reported high concordance in the prediction of CRC into low, medium and high groups using an artificial neural network trained on patient data comprising age, sex, and complete blood count (CBC). ColonFlag10 can be used to identify individuals at high risk of CRC using specific blood-based markers and refer them to screening procedures such as colonoscopy. More recently, a cell-free DNA-based blood test for the early detection of CRC has been clinically validated in the ECLIPSE study11. Moreover, multi-cancer early detection technologies12 such as the"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Patient characteristics\nTo evaluate Deep Profiler across multiple cancer types, we created a cohort of individuals that either have no diagnosis of cancer, or were diagnosed with malignant neoplasms of either colorectal, liver or lung. The validation cohorts each include nearly"}, {"title": "Likelihood ratio", "content": "We train Deep Profiler ensembles to estimate cancer risk for three cancer types: colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Given the biomarker values, the model outputs an array of risk scores (from the ensemble) for each cancer type, which are then utilized to compute the likelihood ratio (LR) of post- to pre-test odds. LRs at increasing risk thresholds, together with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, are shown in Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c for colorectal, liver, and lung cancer, respectively (corresponding precision-recall curves are provided in Supplementary Figure S1).\nSince N\u00e6ser et al. reported that the probability of cancer increased with the number of test results outside the reference range17, we used the total out-of-reference-range (OoR) markers as a baseline. Indeed, cancer likelihood increases with the total OoR markers. However, the increase is significantly lower as compared to the Deep Profiler models. Similarly, when compared individually with any of the top-5 markers identified by the model for each cancer, Deep Profiler provides a 2-3 fold improvement.\nIn CRC, age is the only factor considered to determine screening eligibility according to recommendations by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)18. Therefore, we also provide an LR curve for age (normalized between 40 and 85 years) as the single indicator. While CRC shows increased prevalence until the age of about 60, the increase of LR provided by Deep Profiler is significantly higher, with a 4-fold improvement in LR at a threshold greater than 0.8.\nOverall, the liver-specific Deep Profiler model performs significantly better as compared to our Deep Profiler models for CRC and lung cancer (LR of ~7.5 vs. ~4.5 at a threshold of 0.8, respectively), which is also reflected in the corresponding ROC curves. Importantly, performance is preserved when assessed in cohort-specific subsets that only include cases for which measurements for at least nine of top-15 markers are available, indicating that the models did not learn patterns related to missing marker measurements."}, {"title": "Relevant biomarkers by cancer type", "content": "To gain insights into the laboratory markers with highest impact on the LR, we show cohort-level SHAP summaries for our colorectal, liver, and lung cancer models in Figures 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively. Since the LR can range from zero to infinity, we passed the computed LR for each sample through a logistic function with mean 5 and scale 0.5. This ensures that outliers, i.e., samples with significantly low or high LR, do not significantly impact the SHAP value distribution.\nWhile only three (age, albumin and hematocrit) of the 15 most important laboratory markers are shared across all cancer types (only age among the five most important markers), there are at least seven markers shared between any two cancer types. In contrast, fine-tuned cancer type-specific prediction models are required to give more weight to markers predictive of only one cancer type, as, in fact, one (neutrophils), three (total protein, WBC and basophils (%)), and three (BUN-creatinine ratio, calcium, and ALT) markers are most important in only colorectal, liver, and lung cancer, respectively.\nSeveral of the biomarkers that are identified as important in our SHAP analysis have also been independently studied and reported. For instance, six of the 12 markers that were integrated into one or both sex-specific colon cancer prediction models by Goshen et al.19 (ten of which are also available in our cohort) also appear to be most important in our CRC model (RDW, MCV, neutrophils, monocytes, hemoglobin, and AST).\nFor liver cancer, there are currently no screening recommendations, except for hepatitis B carriers, who are recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) to start screening at age 40 and 50 years for men and women, respectively. In our analysis, platelet counts appear as the most important blood marker predictor of liver cancer. In fact, raised platelet counts (> 400 \u00d7 109/l) indicative of thrombocytosis, or even high-normal platelet counts (326\u2013400 \u00d7 109/1) have been reported to be associated with higher cancer incidence, in particular colorectal and lung cancer20. However, patients with high-normal platelet counts had, in general, advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis, which may explain why platelets are particularly important in our liver cancer model, as liver cancer is mostly detected at a late stage, emphasizing the need for improved guidelines concerning screening eligibility.\nOf note, the lack of a clear color gradation indicates interactions between different laboratory markers, illustrating the need to train a holistic model by integrating multiple laboratory markers."}, {"title": "Analysis by comorbidities", "content": "For each of the cancer cohorts, we used phecodes21 to identify comorbidities that are more likely to be present in the underlying population prior to cancer diagnosis. Relative odds ratios were computed to select comorbidities that are significantly different"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Here, we report on the development and evaluation of separate deep learning-based risk prediction models for three cancer types based on routine laboratory marker measurements. Although other blood marker-based pan-cancer or cancer-specific risk prediction models have been reported, a direct comparison of performance and markers identified to be important for risk assessment is difficult due to varying (i) study designs, e.g., with respect to the follow-up period until cancer diagnosis (90 days23 vs. 365 days in our model), (ii) cancer prevalence in training and validation cohorts (25.2% in24 vs. 5.7 % in our lung cohort), (iii) inclusion criteria (e.g., smoking history in lung cancer), (iv) number and availability of markers (e.g., restrict to samples with complete data vs. imputation of missing data), (v) inclusion of non-routine blood markers (e.g., AFP and CA-12517) as well as patient characteristics other than age and sex25. While the performance is not yet adequate enough for the model to be used as a diagnostic test, we anticipate it to be a valuable tool for recruiting patients into screening programs and, thus, increase screening uptake and efficiency overall, pending additional confirmatory studies. In future work, we also plan to adopt the model to personalize the screening interval after a negative screening result (e.g., based on LDCT).\nWhile the current USPSTF guideline for lung cancer screening only considers age and smoking history for screening eligibility 26, a multitude of risk prediction models have been proposed and reported to show improved performance over the USPSTF criteria27. For instance, the PLCOm2012 model includes race, body mass index, education, presence of chronic lung disease, personal history of cancer, and family history of lung cancer, in addition to age and smoking history28. Furthermore, a four-marker protein panel (4MP), measuring a precursor form of surfactant protein B (Pro-SFTPB), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), has been combined with PLCOm2012 to predict lung cancer risk29. However, the required biomarkers are not assessed within routine blood testing, posing a challenge for the test's clinical utility. In contrast, our model is only based on routine laboratory markers and even performs comparable to models that integrate knowledge about smoking status or smoking history24,25.\nAs cohorts were enriched with patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease, the better performance of our model in liver cancer might originate from an improved differential diagnosis. Interestingly, ALT and AST are not picked up as important markers for liver cancer either, which might also be tied to the model trying to differentiate from chronic liver disease cases in the control set. Analogous, the addition of cases with chronic bowel and lung disease could prove helpful in the colorectal and lung cancer setting, respectively.\nThe SHAP analysis in Figure 3 depicts the contributions of important laboratory markers to the normalized LR on the cohort level. In addition, we provide the relative contributions of laboratory markers to model prediction on the individual level as waterfall plots in Supplementary Figure S2 for two selected cases: (1) a liver cancer case with only four OoR markers (total CO2, lymphocytes (%), hemoglobin, and hematocrit, Supplementary Figure S2a), of which total CO2 and hematocrit are the only 2 of the 15 laboratory markers with highest impact on model prediction (Figure 3b), and a control case with 18 OoR markers (Supplementary Figure S2b), both correctly classified by the model with a high (> 0.8) and low (~ 0) risk, respectively. These example cases illustrate the importance of considering the measurements of a range of markers together to achieve optimal risk assessment.\nIn this work, we have focused on CBC and CMP blood tests as availability of complete lipid panel blood tests was limited in our cohorts. While lipid panel use is less common in Europe, it is more frequently ordered in the US. In fact, we expect its integration into our risk models to further improve cancer risk assessment by contributing complementary information on physiological or pathological status.\nTo avoid potential harm resulting from unnecessary follow-up procedures, differential life expectancy, e.g., as a result of competing comorbidities, needs to be taken into account30. This is of particular importance, as chronic diseases may increase the risk of complications from biopsies and cancer treatment. While we have focused on prioritizing patients for screening eligibility, allowing clinicians to discuss with patients who have been predicted to be at increased risk to conduct follow-up screening procedures as early as possible, we plan to investigate different risk grading and threshold approaches that may be applied in dependence of the presence/absence of certain comorbidities.\nSimilarly, it would be of great value if we could explore the contributions of laboratory markers with respect to cancer stage. Unfortunately, we did not have access to a cohort-linked cancer registry and, therefore, lack information on cancer stage. In the future, we anticipate such an analysis to open up the possibility to develop cancer risk prediction models that also provide an assessment of cancer progress."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Study selection\nWe created a cohort of individuals diagnosed with malignant neoplasms of colorectal, liver or lung, or had no confirmed diagnosis of any malignant neoplasm, within the period from 2017 to 2021.

We then performed additional steps to enrich the development cohort that may assist in training a robust model as well as in cleaning the validation cohort to remove any ambiguous records. Specifically, we filter out patient records that correspond to severe/acute infection such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and/or septic shock, since they can result in significant change in CBC and CMP marker levels and may not be relevant in the pre-screening scenario. We also enriched the development cohort by adding newly diagnosed cancer patients whose records do not include a visit associated with any of the screening codes.\nGiven the development and validation cohorts, we normalized the distributions of biomarker values by subtracting their median and dividing by their inter-quartile distance (IQD). In addition, we transformed the distributions of the following markers to the logarithmic (log10) scale prior to their normalization: alanine aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, creatinine, erythrocyte distribution width (RDW), glucose, leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and urea nitrogen. Note that the pre-processing parameters (i.e., median and IQD values) for all markers were only computed on the development cohort, and the same parameter values were then applied to the validation cohort."}, {"title": "Deep Profiler", "content": "Given the pre-processed development cohort, we employed a deep neural network called Deep Profiler34 to train models for each of the three cancer scenarios. This method has previously been applied to train models to predict a severity progression risk score for COVID-19 patients based on biomarkers (age and nine blood markers) obtained at the time of admission34,35. Furthermore, it was demonstrated to be robust to marker missingness as well as competitive to other methods such as a logistic regression and boosted forests.\nThe Deep Profiler model builds on a variational autoencoder architecture36, and consists of three main networks: an encoder for extracting prominent features represented in a latent space, a decoder for reconstructing the input data to ensure data fidelity of the latent feature representation, and, finally, a multi-label classifier network, which is trained to estimate the ordinal risk score. Use of autoencoders to deal with robustness to missing data has been demonstrated to be effective37,38.\nIn this work, we use the same Deep Profiler architecture for each of the three cancer models, with a symmetric encoder-decoder structure, each comprising of blocks of three fully connected layers with 32 kernels. Each fully connected layer in the encoder is followed by a batch normalization and LeakyReLU (0.2), and each fully connected layer in the decoder is followed by batch normalization and ReLU. Network parameters were learned using the ADAM optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10-4. The training loss is a combination of reconstruction loss (only applied to corresponding input features whose values are not missing), VAE regularization loss and binary cross entropy loss based on the patient's diagnosis."}, {"title": "Prediction uncertainty using Deep Profiler ensembles", "content": "While the VAE helps adding robustness to data missingness, undesirable biases may still be present due to the patient population/sampling. To this end, we trained an ensemble of Deep Profiler models. Given the ensemble of models, a confidence interval for the risk score (output of the sigmoid layer) is computed. Each model is trained on different subsets of the data, accounting for variations in the acquisition protocols across hospitals, availability of various biomarkers, measurement methods used to assess the biomarker as well as biomarker measurements such as laboratory values, age range, comorbidities, etc. In this study, for each cancer scenario, we used an ensemble of ten Deep Profiler models."}, {"title": "Estimation of likelihood ratios", "content": "Given the patient biomarker data and computed confidence interval over the risk score, the next key step is to present this information such that it can be easily interpreted and acted upon.

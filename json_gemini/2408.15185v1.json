{"title": "PoseWatch: A Transformer-based Architecture for\nHuman-centric Video Anomaly Detection Using\nSpatio-temporal Pose Tokenization", "authors": ["Ghazal Alinezhad Noghre", "Armin Danesh Pazho", "Hamed Tabkhi"], "abstract": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due\nto the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic\nenvironments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces\nadditional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and sub-\nstantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of\nmodels that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements\nhave focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate pri-\nvacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we\nintroduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric\npose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-\nPRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also\nbeneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin\nDecoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video\ndata. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch con-\nsistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This\nwork not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating\nNatural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a rapidly\ngrowing area within Computer Vision that focuses\non automatically identifying unusual events or\nbehaviors in video sequences (Ren et al., 2021;\nPatrikar and Parate, 2022; Abbas and Al-Ani,"}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "The field of anomaly detection has evolved, adapt-\ning to scientific advancements, particularly within\nthe realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Patrikar\nand Parate, 2022; Zhu et al., 2020).

We define the absolute pose sequence as\nfollows:\n$S_{to}^i = [P_{to}, P_{to+1}, p_{to+2},..., p_{to+B-1}]$ (1)\nwhere $S_i$ is the absolute pose sequence of\nperson i, Pis pose data containing (x,y) coor-\ndinates of the joints, to is the starting frame of\nthe sequence, and \u1e9e is the input window size.\nThis will provide the model with basic informa-\ntion about the position of a person's joints in each\nsequence frame.

Con-\nsequently, the way attention is applied depends\nsignificantly on how the input data is tokenized.\nIn order to utilize the full potential of the\ntransformer self-attention module we introduce\na Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose Tok-\nenization (ST-PRP). After conducting extensive\nexperiments with various tokenization strategies,\nas detailed in Section 6, we identified ST-PRP as\nthe best-performing approach.

The PoseWatch CTD\nbranch has an encoder-decoder structure. We\nchose our design to use a non-autoregressive strat-\nergy to take advantage of the parallelization of\nthe transformer's structure. In the CTD branch,\nwe chose the target sequence of the decoder to\nbe equal to the current sequence TC. Both the\nencoder and the decoder are chosen to have 12\nheads. Considering the real-time nature of the\nanomaly detection task, we choose a minimal\n4 number of layers with the feed-forward layer\ndimensions set to 64. Unlike most NLP tasks,\nwe do not need to define a start token and end\ntoken for the sequences since the input and out-\nput sequences have fixed lengths. PoseWatch does\nnot use masking strategies for both the input and\ntarget sequences since these sequences are always\navailable even in the inference time. The output\nof the CTD branch for the input TC is:\n$TC'_{to} = [Token'_{to}, Token'_{to},\u2026\u2026\u2026, Token'_{to \u03b2-1}]$ (4)\nwhere Token' is the nth generated token of\nthe ith person in the to sequence TC to.\nFinally, the MSE loss between the generated\nsequence $TC'_{to}i$ and the input sequence $TC_{to}^i$ is\nused both as the training loss and calculating the\nCTD Score ($CS_{to+B/2}^i$) in the inference time."}, {"title": "3.2.2 FTD Branch (PoseWatch-F):", "content": "As illustrated in Figure 2, the PoseWatch FTD\nand CTD branches utilize a shared encoder."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Pose Watch Hybrid\n(PoseWatch-H):", "content": "In order to be able to capture all anomalous\npatterns detected by both the CTD and the\nFTD branches, we combine the scores from these\nbranches to calculate the Hybrid Score or HS of\nthe ith person.

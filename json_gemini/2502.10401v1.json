The ubiquitous\nrise of artificial intelligence applications and their impact on society demands the field of Information\nScience acknowledge the socio-technical nature of these technologies. Previous definitions of Information\nScience over the last six decades have inadequately addressed the environmental, human, and social aspects\nof these technologies. This perspective piece advocates for an expanded definition of Information Science\nthat fully includes the socio-technical impacts information has on the conduct of research in this field.\nProposing an expanded definition of Information Science that includes the socio-technical aspects of this\nfield should stimulate both conversation and widen the interdisciplinary lens necessary to address how\nintelligent technologies may be incorporated into society and our lives more fairly.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The need for the Information Sciences (IS) has never been more important for addressing the\nimpacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on society. Besides humans, other cognitive-like systems\nsuch as AI, can act on information with consequential outcomes. From devastating impacts to our\nnatural environments (Crawford, 2021), to algorithmic oppression (Noble, 2018) the need for IS\npractitioners that understand the full range of socio-technical aspects is crucial for promoting the\nbest long-term outcomes of AI for society. For these reasons, current definitions that describe the\ncontent of IS are inadequate for characterizing what the field now encompasses. Though, scope\nhas always been a problem in defining IS with some being too inclusive and others, not inclusive\nenough (Aspray, 2011). As AI becomes more capable and interacts with information on behalf of\nusers, broadening the boundaries of IS are necessary to address the myriad of way this technology\nis impacting individuals and society.\nTechnologies such as AI and machine learning, while promising to make our lives easier, are\nalso exploiting our predictable behaviors and marginalizing many groups (Birhane et al., 2021;\nO'Neil, 2017). As AI and similar technologies continue to permeate ever deeper into more aspects\nof human life, there is still little understanding of their long-term effects (Glikson & Woolley,\n2020; Nishant et al., 2020; Siddarth et al., 2021). The desire to introduce figures of merit for every\naspect of human life from calorie intake, steps taken, average resting heart rate to Amazon\nrecommendations and continuous location monitoring, highlights the nature of emergent socio-\ntechnical aspects of life. The penchant for quantification and instrumentation of society alludes to\nthe limitations of current definitions of IS that have been put forth over the last six decades.\nMoreover, Al is not only a substitutional technology but is infrastructural because it is\ntransforming ways of life (Barley, 2020). Addressing these shortcomings requires a more\ncomprehensive definition of IS to expand the basis of analysis in this field to place renewed\nemphasis on consideration of the additional enviro-social aspects of AI and similar intelligent\ntechnologies.\nWe address these shortcomings by first outlining AI with its environmental and social impacts,\nboth at the individual and societal levels. Then, we show that IS provides an ideal socio-technical\nframing for understanding the nexus of humans and these technologies. Next, we discuss current\ndefinitions of IS and what they neglect. Finally, we discuss an amended definition of IS for the\n21st century to foreground the impacts information has on both humans and societies. We close\nwith implications for the field of IS."}, {"title": "Impacts of A\u0399", "content": "There is much controversy over the broad impacts of AI.

AI is composed of a vast\necosystem that is sustained through the continuous extraction of natural resources such as coal,\nrare earth minerals, and other toxic chemicals (Crawford, 2021). Materials needed to sustain the\nongoing hardware needs of storage, silicon chips, and energy are necessary to maintain the ever-\nincreasing needs of a technology to support additional data and compute requirements for training\nmore complex models (Magubane, 2023). Yet, such impacts are often unrecognized.\nThe impacts of AI on the environment are also measurable by their operations. Large Al models\nsuch as frontier models powering large language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) that have\ncaptured the public's attention are run on equipment held within enormous data centers (Pascual,\n2023). Recent reports suggest that such AI applications even have an outsized carbon footprint\n(Coleman, 2023; Saul & Bass, 2023; Sundberg, 2023). AI techniques such as deep learning (e.g.,\nneural networks), may consist of billions of hyperparameters that require increased energy\nconsumption to train these models (Tamburrini, 2022). For instance, some researchers have\nsuggested that Al computational requirements are projected to outpace all power produced\nworldwide by 2040 (Hopkin, 2023). While such prognostication may seem hyperbolic, these\nimpacts are garnering more attention and highlighting the harms AI imposes on society (Labbe,\n2021; Lai et al., 2022). These and other harms must be taken into consideration by the IS\ncommunity to address the unsustainable practices of rampant information technology proliferation\nand AI energy consumption at the expense of the environment."}, {"title": "Social Impacts of AI", "content": "AI has many human impacts that affect not only the environment, but the social fabric itself as\nthese technologies become more embedded in society (Selenko et al., 2022). While warnings of"}, {"title": "Al's Societal Harms", "content": "Unlike the environmental harms, the social harms caused by AI are equally concerning.\nResearchers have empirically found Al's influence on society from the dissemination of\ndisinformation (Whyte, 2020), class discrimination based on race and gender (Buolamwini &\nGebru, 2018), disabilities (Whittaker et al., 2019), to general fairness (Madaio et al., 2022). The\nchallenge with societal impacts of Al points to how such harms flow to the individual level\n(Acemoglu, 2021). For instance, disinformation campaigns enabled by AI portend an exacerbation\nof current trends towards undermining faith in democratic processes (Brkan, 2019; Kaplan, 2020;\nLandon-Murray et al., 2019). This was seen most clearly in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign\nwith Cambridge Analytica's involvement using Facebook data to harness the power of AI for\ninfluencing targeted populations (Isaak & Hanna, 2018; Schippers, 2020). However, such harms\nare enabled through the collection of massive quantities of data.\nPeople provide the fuel for AI through the abundant amount of data they generate interacting\nwith smart technologies today. Organizations such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon harvest\npersonal data by offering free software in exchange for internet browsing behaviors, purchase\nproclivities, and location data (Freedman, 2023; Li et al., 2019). Companies and governments can\nthen use this data to make decisions, but potentially perpetuate bias against large classes of people.\nA most often cited example of this is the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for\nAlternative Sanctions (COMPAS). COMPAS uses data to calculate recidivism risk, but empirical\nresearch demonstrated that the software program used by many U.S. states had a high number of\nfalse positives towards African American offenders (Mehrabi et al., 2021). These and other well-\ndocumented behaviors of AI systems cast a long shadow of harms toward society that IS should\nbe positioned to address."}, {"title": "Al's Individual Harms", "content": "Societal harms such as environmental degradation and marginalization of certain groups of\npeople are ultimately felt at the individual level.

Arguably,\nIS has been in a slow decline for some years as sub-fields within the field break off into their own\ndisciplines and university departments reorganize (Meadows, 2008). With the rise of personal\ncomputers and more recently smartphones, the field of IS became less about librarians organizing\nknowledge and information to everyone curating their own information (Gilchrist, 2014).\nCombined with ubiquitous search and now augmented with AI, IS may be suffering from a lack\nof a comprehensive identity (Benbasat & Zmud, 2003; Floridi, 2002).

The practice of IS goes\nback to at least the 1950s (Furner, 2015; Wersig & Neveling, 1975). Originally, IS was closely\naligned, if not synonymous with library sciences (Meadows, 2008). Wellisch (1972) stated as far\nback as 1972 that at least 39 definitions of IS existed and were compared for common concepts\nwhere he concluded that no consensus existed. An often-repeated definition of IS was given by\nBorko (1968). Borko's definition is provided in Table 1 along with six more modern definitions\nfor contrast and comparison. Tellingly, each definition lacks an explicit social component, save\nfor Saracevic's (1999) definition.\nCurrent definitions of IS are not only antiquated but lack the intersubjective aspects of today's\ntechnologies and the depth necessary for investigating such emergent phenomena. The inherent\nemphasis in Borko's definition on the technical-mechanical aspects of information has impeded\nprogress and relevance to the field of IS (Buckland, 2012). These prominent definitions also\nneglect the rich understanding that emerges from the social and the human-cognitive interactions\nwith AI technologies. However, the IS community acknowledged that while there was no agreed\nupon definition of IS at the time of his writing, researchers such as Roberts (1976) agreed upon\nthe significance of the social aspects of information concepts and related phenomena in IS. Now\nlikely lost to history, we may never know why the social aspects were never fully adopted into\ndefinitions of IS proper.\nTo rectify the shortcomings of these definitions and expand it to better encompass the socio-\ntechnical aspects, we argue that expanding the boundaries of the definition of IS will better align\nresearch efforts to truly become an interdisciplinary science for addressing intelligent technologies\nsuch as AI and its host of impacts to the environment and society."}, {"title": "Recalibrating IS", "content": "To argue for a new definition of IS requires an understanding of what current definitions lack.\nEndemic to much of the research in the early area of IS was an emphasis on positivism as a\ndominant epistemology for investigating phenomena (Walsham, 1995). Positivism assumes that\nreality is mind-independent and discoverable by a researcher (Geertz, 1973; Guba & Lincoln,\n1994; Orlikowski & Baroudi, 1991). Arguably, the positivistic stance has led to an impoverished\nand partial understanding of information systems phenomena which is not sufficient (Orlikowski\n& Baroudi, 1991).

The field of\nAl is composed of both natural and social sciences in a way that makes the two inextricably tied\ntogether. Therefore, solving the challenges of AI through a purely natural science or a purely social\nscience approach will miss the emergent behaviors of the system that requires both working in\ntandem.\nWhile the differences between the natural and social sciences may look insurmountable, they\nare, however, complementary in several important ways when brought together through a human-\ncentered design process. Human design is a center piece in the sciences of the artificial and should\nbe at the forefront for how we can approach IS with an emphasis toward the socio-technical.\nThe natural and social sciences both have a deep appreciation for the scientific method by\ncontinuous experimentation and reevaluation of knowledge claims. For instance, these sciences\nuse inductive and deductive arguments to make specific knowledge claims. These scientific\ndisciplines value rigorous scrutiny of their peers and feedback from communities of colleagues.\nThe similarities and differences between the natural and social sciences also make them\ncomplementary under IS for understanding AI. First, because our planet's resources are finite, the\nnatural sciences help inform debates on the environmental impacts of AI, which requires the\nunique perspectives and empirical rigor of natural scientists to inform debate and policies that\nimpact humans and society. Conversely, social sciences can complement the natural sciences by\ninforming them on the potential unforeseen impacts of supporting the entire AI ecosystem, while\nalso informing the ethical debates that can arise from such discussions.\nSecond, IS can help these sciences reach consilience by harmonizing the different questions\nand approaches that arise from debating the merits of AI technologies.

The need for IS researchers who\ncan bridge the gap between the natural and social sciences will be crucial for helping to inform\ntechnology adoption, fair policies, and just laws. IS, though ambiguous in some respects due to\nits broad interdisciplinary approach to science, can deftly inform research approaches by having\na foot planted in both worlds. The philosophical underpinnings of both approaches, whether it is\na grounded theory approach by social science researcher or the mathematical rigor of the natural\nsciences, provide a much richer and comprehensive understanding for informing all aspects of IS\nand our sociotechnical futures.\nVarieties of methods for generating and justifying knowledge claims and the conceptual tools\nfor fully understanding the implications of AI and similar technologies will lead to new insights.\nHistorical neglect of a true socio-technical framing of IS research has likely led to not only the\ndecline of the field, but an impoverished view of the phenomena of interest.

Often, fields that\ncall themselves interdisciplinary convey a sense of weakness and may be seen as inferior to the\nmore well-established disciplines (e.g., physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering) (Buckland,\n2012). Worse still, IS has also been maligned as a field of study with claims that it is neither about\ninformation nor a true science (Furner, 2015).\nReinvigorating the field of IS will require impactful research that profoundly moves the needle\ntowards better scientific explanations for phenomena of interest. The interdisciplinary nature of IS\nhas prevented it from having what Hj\u00f8rland (2014) calls a \u201csufficiently strong centripetal force\nthat can keep the field together\u201d (p. 1). However, recrafting the definition of IS with an emphasis\non a socio-technical approach can act as the unifying force for the field. The socio-technical\nunderstanding of organizational entities is crucial for understanding how people, technology, and\nenvironment interact with one another (Cummings & Markus, 1979). The rapid proliferation of AI\nand its numerous pitfalls will summarily challenge any narrow interpretation of the phenomenon,\nwhich could lead to shortsighted policy and law for curbing its potential harms.\nThe challenging aspects of AI and the harms it has already wrought on the environment,\nsocieties, and individual humans must be addressed to avoid further damages. IS must balance\nboth sides of the technology and human sides of the equation or risk evolving into two separate\ninformation sciences (Saracevic, 1999). In the end, amending the definition of IS is a good start,\nyet it is clearly not enough and far from over."}]}

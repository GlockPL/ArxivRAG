{"title": "Educational Customization by Homogenous Grouping of e-Learners based\non their Learning Styles", "authors": ["Mohammadreza Amiri", "Gholam Ali Montazer", "Ebrahim Mousavi"], "abstract": "The E-learning environment offers greater flexibility compared to face-to-face interactions, allowing\nfor adapting educational content to meet learners' individual needs and abilities through personalization\nand customization of e-content and the educational process. Despite the advantages of this approach,\ncustomizing the learning environment can reduce the costs of tutoring systems for similar learners by\nutilizing the same content and process for co-like learning groups. Various indicators for grouping\nlearners exist, but many of them are conceptual, uncertain, and subject to change over time.\n\nIn this article, we propose using the Felder-Silverman model, which is based on learning styles, to group\nsimilar learners. Additionally, we model the behaviors and actions of e-learners in a network\nenvironment using Fuzzy Set Theory (FST). After identifying the learning styles of the learners, co-like\nlearning groups are formed, and each group receives adaptive content based on their preferences, needs,\ntalents, and abilities. By comparing the results of the experimental and control groups, we determine\nthe effectiveness of the proposed grouping method. In terms of \"educational success,\" the weighted\naverage score of the experimental group is 17.65 out of 20, while the control group achieves a score of\n12.6 out of 20. Furthermore, the \"educational satisfaction\" of the experimental group is 67%, whereas\nthe control group's satisfaction level is 37%.", "sections": [{"title": "1-Introduction", "content": "E-learning is an approach that aims to provide a well-planned, interactive, and learner-oriented learning\nenvironment for individuals, regardless of their location and time availability. It utilizes various digital\ntechnologies to create a flexible and distributed learning environment (Dovalli & Montazer, 2010). The\nkey features of e-learning include extreme flexibility, learner-centeredness, and the elimination of time\nand place limitations, all of which contribute to creating equal opportunities for learning (Stephan et\nal., 1977).\n\nIn recognition of the diverse talents of learners, personalized learning has emerged as an approach to\nachieve effective learning by tailoring the learning content to the abilities and needs of each individual.\nThis approach involves aligning teaching methods, educational programs, and content with the unique\ncharacteristics of each learner. Consequently, different versions of educational paths and teaching\nmaterials need to be created, taking into account the specific preferences of each learner. However,\nachieving this goal comes with challenges, such as the cost and time required to customize the\ncurriculum and content for individual learners. To address these challenges, an alternative solution is to\ncustomize e-learning courses for groups of learners with similar characteristics within an e-learning\nnetwork. By grouping learners based on their similarities, it becomes possible to create tailored\neducational experiences that are more efficient and cost-effective (Sanjabi & Montazer, 2020).\n\nIn summary, we are shifting the focus from the complex task of personalizing education and learning\nfor each individual learner, which requires understanding their unique characteristics and designing\ntailored programs, to customizing the program and content for groups of learners who share similar\ncharacteristics Gomede, Miranda de Barros & de Souza Mendes, 2020). This approach allows us to\nstreamline the process by tailoring the educational experience to a specific group rather than trying to\ncater to each individual learner separately.\n\nTo facilitate educational customization, we begin by identifying an index to group learners. Once this\nindex is selected, learners are grouped together to receive personalized programs and lessons based on\ntheir individual talents. Subsequently, the outcomes of this approach are evaluated using indicators such\nas 'educational success' and 'educational satisfaction'.\n\nOne of the crucial elements in personalizing/customizing the e-learning environment is the concept of\n\"learning style.\" A learning style refers to an individual's preferred way of comprehending, analyzing,\nand processing information during the learning process (Huang et al., 2020). It is influenced by learners'\nreceptiveness to various information formats and their interaction with the learning environment.\nUnderstanding learners' learning styles is crucial for recognizing their unique differences in the\neducational process and promoting adaptability in e-learning environments (Dindar, Suorsa, Hermes,\nKarppinen & N\u00e4ykki, 2021).\n\nThe objective of this article is to develop and implement an educational customization system. To\nachieve this, a method of homogeneous grouping is employed to categorize e-learners. Subsequently,\nadaptive content is presented to each group. The outcomes of the grouping process are evaluated using\ntwo criteria: educational success and satisfaction. Based on the mentioned points, the structure of the\nrest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2: Examining the concept of grouping and exploring\ndifferent grouping methods. Section 3: Discussing various grouping indicators and introducing the\nconcept of learning styles. Section 4: Presenting an explanation of the problem at hand. Section 5:\nProviding a brief introduction to fuzzy set theory and fuzzy expert systems. Section 6: Describing the\ndesign and implementation of the learning style fuzzy recognition system.

The concept of grouping", "content": "The concept of grouping involves adapting the content and curriculum to meet the needs, abilities, and\ninterests of learners, thereby enhancing the depth and quality of learning. To achieve this goal, it is\nessential to identify the factors that influence learning. By using this knowledge and implementing a\nwell-designed educational approach, programs, and lessons can be customized to match the unique\ncharacteristics and abilities of learners, creating an engaging and interactive learning environment.\nGrouping e-learners entails dividing them into similar groups with the aim of attaining educational\nobjectives, such as developing appropriate content and curriculum for each group (Montazer and\nKamarei, 2018). The purpose of grouping is to enable learners to benefit from others by being part of\nspecific groups, allowing them to interact with different learners, share ideas, and ultimately achieve\nimproved learning outcomes (Jagadish, 2014). The grouping of learners can be accomplished through\nfollowing four general methods (McGillicuddy and Devine, 2018; Nhan & Nhan, 2019; Jagadish,\n2014).\nRandom grouping\nGrouping chosen by the learners\nI.\nII.\nIII.\nIV.\nHomogeneous grouping\nHeterogeneous grouping\nI. Random grouping\nRandom grouping involves the teacher randomly assigning learners to groups based on their own\njudgment. This method is commonly used in classrooms when there is a need to start teaching promptly\nand groups of equal size are required. It is considered a fair and unbiased approach, as each learner has\nan equal chance of being selected for any group. However, in random grouping, some learners may fall\nbehind in the learning process as they may not be paired with suitable peers, deviating them from an\neffective learning path. Additionally, this method can hinder the dynamics of learning groups and make\nit challenging for learners to interact with one another (Nhan & Nhan, 2019).\nii. Grouping chosen by the learners\nIn this method, learners themselves form the groups, and it is generally well-received by the learners.\nTypically, individuals who opt for this method are those who have previously succeeded in their\nlearning experiences or have established social or academic connections with each other (Jagadish,\n2014; McGillicuddy and Devine, 2018). Performance studies have shown that self-selected groups\noutperform random groups. The familiarity among members in self-selected groups facilitates\ncommunication and interaction. Learning in these groups creates a positive atmosphere among group\nmembers, leading to a favorable view of their peers. Members of self-selected groups have increased\nconfidence in each other's abilities and appreciate the collaborative learning experience (Jagadish, 2014;\nMcGillicuddyand Devine, 2018.\niii. Homogeneous grouping\nIn this method, learners are grouped together based on similarities in their individual characteristics,\nsuch as personality, behavior, and talent (Huy, 2019). Homogeneous grouping aims to create groups of\nlearners who share similar teaching and learning methods. In this approach, there is a higher degree of\nsimilarity among group members compared to other groups (Triantafillou et al., 2003). Studies have\nindicated that placing learners with higher abilities in homogeneous groups can enhance their learning\nspeed (Franki lovi 2020). However, this type of grouping may give rise to potential issues, such as\nfuture group superiority within society (Huy, 2019)."}, {"title": "iv. Heterogeneous grouping", "content": "In this approach, learners are grouped based on differences in personality, behavior, talent, and ability\n(Knisely, Levine, Vaughn-Cooke, Wagner & Fink, 2021). The purpose of this grouping is to create\nbalanced groups comprising individuals with diverse abilities, skills, knowledge, gender, race, ethnicity,\nand other criteria. The underlying idea of this method is that each learner benefits from having a study\npartner within the group (Brame & Biel, 2015). In this method, capable learners gain a deeper\nunderstanding of their thinking processes, enhance their analysis of lesson content, and achieve better\nlearning outcomes. Simultaneously, less capable learners benefit from the presence of more capable\npeers, thereby enhancing their own learning (Yulyng et al., 2021)"}, {"title": "3. Grouping Indicators", "content": "Various indices have been employed to address the grouping problem in adaptive learning networks.\nInstead of relying on a single index, it is possible to integrate multiple grouping indices. The primary\nmodels for grouping e-learners based on similarity can be categorized into 13 different categories,\nincluding personality models, behavioral models, developed Personality models, Behavioral models,\nDeveloped personality models, Learning style models, Motivation, Feelings and emotions, IQ, Learning\nspeed, Previous knowledge, Age and gender, Goal orientation, Memory and Self-efficiency ().\n\nIn this article, the learning style index has been chosen from the aforementioned indicators for grouping\nlearners. Therefore, we will provide further explanation about it in the following sections."}, {"title": "3-1. Learning Style", "content": "Learning style refers to the preferred approach an individual has when it comes to learning. It identifies\nthe learner's preferences in terms of how they prefer learning content to be presented, how they interact\nwith course materials, and how they absorb information from their environment (Hawk & Shah, 2007).\n\nThe Felder Silverman's Learning Style Model (FSLSM) has been widely utilized for personalizing e-\nlearning environments and quantitatively assessing learning styles. This model categorizes learners into\nfour dimensions: Perception, Input, Processing, and Understanding (Graf, Viola, Leo & Kinshuk, 2007;\nNafea, Siewe & He, 2019).\n\nIn the \"Perception\" dimension, learners are classified into two categories: emotional and perceptive.\nEmotional learners prefer to acquire information through direct interaction with the real world, while\nperceptive learners prefer to gather information indirectly through their own conjectures and\nimagination.\n\nIn the \"Input\" dimension, visual learners have a preference for learning materials that are presented\nvisually, such as figures, tables, and graphs. On the other hand, auditory learners prefer to receive\ninformation through auditory channels, such as listening to lectures or discussions.\n\nIn the \"Processing\" dimension, active learners thrive in interactive and cooperative learning\nenvironments, where they actively engage with other learners. Reflective learners, on the other hand,\nprefer to absorb information individually or in small groups, reflecting on it before further engagement.\n\nThe final dimension of learning style is \"Understanding,\" which distinguishes between sequential and\nholistic learners. Sequential learners prefer to learn information in a linear, step-by-step manner,\nbuilding upon each previous piece of knowledge. Holistic learners, on the other hand, seek a\ncomprehensive understanding of the problem at hand, focusing on the bigger picture and generalities.\nThese dimensions provide insights into how individuals prefer to perceive, receive, process, and\nunderstand information, contributing to their overall learning style."}, {"title": "4. Problem Statement", "content": "In this article, the focus is on educational customization and grouping learners based on their learning\nstyle, specifically using the Felder-Silverman learning style index. The aim is to identify learners'\nlearning styles indirectly through their network actions in an electronic learning environment. To\naccount for the uncertainty and ambiguity in human behaviors and their interpretation, a mathematical\nmodel is developed using fuzzy set theory. This leads to the design and implementation of a fuzzy\nexperience system.\n\nBy grouping learners based on their learning style, the educational strategy and adapted lesson content\ncan be tailored to each group. The results obtained from this approach are then analyzed and evaluated.\nThe overall goal is to provide a personalized learning experience by leveraging learners' individual\nlearning styles and optimizing the educational process based on their needs and preferences."}, {"title": "5. Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy expert system", "content": "Fuzzy set theory, pioneered by Zadeh in 1965De Luca & Termini, 1993), recognizes that ambiguity and\nuncertainty are inherent in human thinking. It offers a mathematical framework to handle uncertain data\nand information, making it a crucial tool for modeling ambiguity. The fuzzy set theory employs\nlinguistic variables and if-then rules to represent expert opinions and perform inference using fuzzy\nsets\nFuzzy expert systems, which combine fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic, provide a framework for\nmodeling uncertainty in expert knowledge. They possess two main features:\n1. Approximate Reasoning: Fuzzy expert systems are well-suited for approximate reasoning, especially\nin cases where deriving a mathematical model from a complex system is challenging. They allow for\nreasoning with imprecise and uncertain information.\n2. Linguistic Variables: Fuzzy logic facilitates the use of linguistic variables, which are easily\nunderstood by humans. This enables the system to handle incomplete and uncertain information by\nrepresenting it in linguistic terms.\nIn addition to these features, fuzzy expert systems consist of four key components:\na) Fuzzifier: The fuzzifier module defines the relationships between inputs and linguistic variables\nusing membership functions. It converts the input variables into fuzzy numbers, representing the degree\nof membership in each linguistic variable.\nb) Knowledge base: The knowledge base is created by combining the expertise of domain experts and\nformulating rules using linguistic variables. These rules express the relationships between input and\noutput fuzzy sets. A typical fuzzy rule follows the format :\n\"If the input conditions are satisfied, then the output results can be deduced\".\nc) Inference engine: The inference engine is responsible for decision-making and inference using fuzzy\nrules and operators. One commonly used method is the Mamdani product inference engine, which\napplies fuzzy rules to determine the appropriate output based on the input variables.\nd) Defuzzifier: The defuzzifier module reverses the fuzzification process by generating a definite\noutput value from the fuzzy sets produced by the inference engine. It aims to obtain a crisp output that\ncan be easily understood and utilized. Evaluating the stability of the fuzzy system is crucial, and certain\nconditions can lead to rule instability, such as conflicts with expert knowledge and opinions or\nsimilarities in the first part of rules but differences in the subsequent parts (Ghorbani & Montazer,\n2015).\n\nThese components work together to enable the fuzzy expert system to process uncertain and imprecise\ninformation, make decisions based on fuzzy rules, and generate crisp outputs for further analysis or\naction."}, {"title": "6.

To collect this information, a\nquestionnaire was created to identify the behaviors displayed by learners. Experts were asked to rate\nthe relevance of each behavior to different dimensions of learning style using a range between very low,"}, {"title": "6-3. Fuzzy learning style system rules", "content": "Fuzzy system rules are utilized to express the relationships between input and output variables. For\ninstance, in the context of reflective learning style, learners exhibit a preference for group work, engage\nin communication with a majority of their peers in class, and tend to prioritize action over extensive\ncontemplation. Based on the behaviors associated with the processing dimension, the aforementioned\npreferences can be captured by the following fuzzy rule:\n\nRule 1: If the level of participation in troubleshooting sessions is high, the level of participation in\ndiscussion groups is high, the number of individuals involved is high, the allocated time for testing is\nlow, and the allocated time for practice is also low, then the learner is classified as reflective.\n\nRule 2: If the level of participation in troubleshooting sessions is low, the level of participation in\ndiscussion groups is low, the number of individuals involved is low, the allocated time for testing is\nhigh, and the allocated time for practice is high, then the learner is classified as reflective.\n\nRule 3: If the level of participation in troubleshooting sessions is average, the level of participation in\ndiscussion groups is low, the number of individuals involved is high, the allocated time for testing is\nlow, and the allocated time for practice is average, then the learner is classified as reflective-reactive.\nSimilar reasoning is applied to derive other rules within the system.

Evaluation of the customized environment\nIn order to assess and evaluate the outcomes of the customized learning environment, the \"comparison\nof the average of two independent populations\" test was employed. This test is widely utilized in\nstatistical analysis to compare the means of two independent populations. Specifically, when the data\nfollows a normal distribution, the t-test and associated statistics are suitable for comparing the means\nof two populations (Rochon, Gondan, & Kieser, 2012). By utilizing this test, statistical differences\nbetween the averages of two independent groups can be determined.

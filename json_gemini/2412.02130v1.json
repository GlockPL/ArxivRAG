However, existing distributed evidence fusion methods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they directly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like centralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level consensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure (EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among neighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic probability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective probabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible evidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are inferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear average consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to guarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence in numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving LAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each agent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such randomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the convergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is impossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that PCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher decision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In recent years, the development of sensors and ad hoc network techniques has promoted research on distributed inference [10, 19].

For example,"}, {"title": "2 Problem formulation", "content": "As shown in Fig.1, N distributed agents constitute a distributed system that is modeled as a strongly connected undirected graph. G = (V,\u03b5), where V = {1,2,...,N} and \u03b5 \u2282 V \u00d7 Vare the set of agents and edges, respectively. Two agents connected by an edge e = (i, j) \u2208 \u03b5 are called neighbors. The set of neighbors of Agent i is expressed as N\u1d62 = {j| (i, j) \u2208\u03b5 }. Let A = [a\u1d62\u2c7c] \u2208 \u211d^(N\u00d7N) and A\u1d62 = [a\u1d62\u2c7c] \u2208 \u211d^(N\u00d7N) be the adjacency matrix of G and the local adjacency matrix of Agent i, respectively, with a\u1d62\u2c7c = a\u2c7c\u1d62 = 1 for (i, j) \u2208 \u03b5 and a\u1d62\u2c7c = a\u2c7c\u1d62 = 0 for otherwise.\nThe N agents perform a collective decision-making task in which all complete and mutually exclusive potential decision results form a finite set, FoD [30], written as \u03a9 = {A\u2081, A\u2082,..., A\u2099}. Here, A\u1d62 is a potential decision result. During the decision-making process, the agent's information is uniformly characterized in the FoD space to cope with the heterogeneity and uncertainty of the source data. In the beginning, each of the N agents holds a piece of evidence, also called basic belief assignment (BBA) or mass function, defined on the FoD. Note that Agent i's raw evidence m\u1d62 is a mapping m\u1d62 : 2^\u03a9 \u2192 [0,1] such that:\n\u2211_A\u2282\u03a9 m\u1d62 (A) = 1\n(1)\nand, in general, m\u1d62 (\u00d8) = 0.\nThe communication constraints of agents and the task goals for the collective decision-making task are shown in Fig.1. Agents are required to collaboratively fuse all pieces of evidence. During this process, data sharing is limited to authenticated neighboring agents to prevent exposure of agent preferences. In other words, the raw evidence of an agent is not shared with or inferred by any other agents. As there is no fusion center, agents have to exchange and update data iteratively to reach consensus. The term \u201cconsensus\" encompasses three aspects: first, the basis for credibility calculation, i.e., the EDMM, is consistent; second, all agents obtain the same fusion result; and third, the fusion result accurately converges to the CCEF. As shown in Fig.2, the CCEF procedure is outlined below at first:\n1) EDM calculation: Compute EDMs among N pieces of evidence. Here, a commonly used EDM, Dismp [36], is shown:\nd\u1d62\u2c7c = (DismP(m\u1d62, m\u2c7c) = DistP(m\u1d62, m\u2c7c) + ConfP(m\u1d62, m\u2c7c))/(1+ DistP(m\u1d62, m\u2c7c)Conf P(m\u1d62, m\u2c7c))\n(2)\nwhere d\u1d62\u2c7c is the EDM between m\u1d62 and m\u2c7c, and\nDistP (m\u1d62, m\u2c7c) = (1/2)(\u2211_(A\u2096\u2208\u03a9), |A\u2096|=1 |BetP\u1d62(A\u2096) - BetP\u2c7c(A\u2096)|\u00b2)^(1/\u03b7) (3)\nConf P (m\u1d62, m\u2c7c) = {BetP\u1d62(X^max_(m\u1d62)) BetP\u2c7c(X^max_(m\u2c7c)), if X^max_(m\u1d62) \u2260 X^max_(m\u2c7c) otherwise\ns.t. X^max_(ml) = arg max_A\u2096\u2208\u03a9 BetP_ml (A\u2096), l = i, j (4)\nwhere \u03b7 = 2; DistP and Con f P are respectively the probabilistic-based distance and the conflict coefficient. They are calculated by Pignistic probability, i.e., BetP = [BetP\u1d62(A\u2081), BetP\u1d62(A\u2082),\u2026, BetP\u1d62(A\u2099)]\u1d40:\nBetP\u1d62 (A\u2096) = \u2211_(B\u2282\u03a9, A\u2096\u2282B) (1/|B|)m\u1d62 (B) (5)\nwhere |B| is the cardinality of B.\n2) Credibility calculation: Compute the credibility Cred\u1d62 of m\u1d62:\nCred\u1d62 = (min_(1\u2264j\u2264N) \u2211_(k=1,k\u2260j)^N d\u2c7c\u2096)/(\u2211_(k=1,k\u2260i)^N d\u1d62\u2096) (6)"}, {"title": "3 Evidence pre-processing:", "content": "Furthermore, raw evidence is discounted in a crediability-dependent style to reduce conflicting [59]:\nm'\u1d62(A) = {Cred\u1d62 \u22c5 m\u1d62(A), if A \u2260 \u03a9 m'\u1d62(\u03a9) = 1 \u2212 \u2211_(A\u22082^\u03a9, A\u2260\u03a9) m'\u1d62(A), otherwise.

The w\u1d62 is the weight assignment of m\u1d62 [47]. It is another representation of evidence. For \u2200A \u2208 2^\u03a9{\u00d8,}, \u03c9\u1d62 (A) is calculated by:\n\u03c9\u1d62 (A) = \u2211_(B\u2283A) (-1)^(|B|-|A|) ln Q\u1d62 (B) (12)\nwhere Q\u1d62 (A) : 2^\u03a9 \u2192 [0, 1] is the so-called commonality function that is converted by the mass function:\nQ\u1d62 (A) = \u2211_(B\u2283A) m\u1d62 (B) (13)\nThe Eq.(10) will lead to the fact that the states of all agents converge to \u2211_(i=1)^N \u03c9\u1d62/N when G is a strongly connected graph. Considering that the fusion of mass functions with DR is equivalent to the addition of weight assignments, i.e., the weight assignment corresponding to the m\u1d62\u2295 m\u2c7c is \u03c9\u1d62 + \u03c9\u2c7c, SO \u2211_(i=1)^N \u03c9\u1d62/N is exactly 1/N of the fusion result of all pieces of evidence with DR. Let \u03c9\u2295 be the weight assignment of m\u2295, then:\nm\u2295 = A\u2295\u2081 \u2295 A\u2295\u2082 ... \u2295 A\u2295_(k) (14)"}, {"title": "3 The PCEF algorithm", "content": "where A\u2295\u2096 is the simple mass function [11] corresponding to w\u2295(A\u2096), and r = 2^n - 2. According to the analysis of CCEF and existing distributed evidence fusion above, there are several challenges to realizing the collective decision-making task shown in Fig.1:\n1) In EDM calculation, Eq.(2) asks agents to collect a pair of raw evidence simultaneously, which is hindered by the privacy requirements, i.e., the forbiddings of raw evidence sharing and non-neighbors information sharing.\n2) In credibility calculation, all EDMs among pieces of evidence are involved in Eq.(6). Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all agents possess identical EDMs.\n3) In evidence fusion, uniform EDMs mean that evidence credibilities are publicly accessible to all agents, and hence the pre-processed evidence and raw evidence can be derived from each other according to Eq.(7). In other words, taking the pre-processed evidence as the initial state of Eq.(10) is not privacy-preserving.\nTo address the three challenges of CEF in a fully privacy-preserving distributed network, a method named PCEF that includes EDM neighbor consensus, EDM network consensus, and fusion network consensus is proposed in this section, as shown in Fig.3. In EDM neighbor consensus, neighboring agents compute the EDM between their raw evidence without knowledge of each other's raw evidence and BetP. In EDM network consensus, the EDM of non-neighboring agents' raw evidence is estimated based on the correlation between the rows of the EDMM and the already-obtained EDMs between neighbors' raw evidence. The result of this consensus is that each agent holds a complete, all-agent-consistent EDMM, which will be used for credibility computation. In fusion network consensus, differential privacy and credibility compensation are introduced into Eq.(10) for a finite time to protect the privacy of raw evidence and lead all agents to achieve consensus on fusion."}, {"title": "3.1 EDM neighbor consensus", "content": "Although the computation of Dismp does not involve accurate information about m\u1d62 and m\u2c7c, BetP still features the agent's preferences. Therefore, the privacy of BetP is also required to be protected during the computation of Dismp besides the raw evidence. To this end, this section utilizes two secure multi-party computation protocols, namely the inner product computation of Pignistic probabilities and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective probabilities, to compute the EDM of neighboring agents\u2019 raw evidence while protecting the privacy of the agent's raw evidence and BetP.\nThe privacy calculation of DistP is presented next. According to Eq.(3), DistP can be written as:\nDistP (m\u1d62, m\u2c7c) = (1/\u221a2) (\u2211_(A\u2096\u2208\u03a9, |A\u2096|=1) |BetP\u1d62 (A\u2096) - BetP\u2c7c (A\u2096)|\u00b2)^(1/\u03b7)\n= (BetP\u1d62 - BetP\u2c7c)\u1d40 (BetP\u1d62 - BetP\u2c7c)\n= (1/2)(((BetP\u1d62, BetP\u1d62) + (BetP\u2c7c, BetP\u2c7c) - 2 (BetP\u1d62, BetP\u2c7c)) (15)\nwhere (...) is the dot product operation. It is apparently simple and safe to compute (BetP\u1d62, BetP\u2c7c) locally at Agent i and send it to neighboring agents. But (BetP\u1d62, BetP\u2c7c) cannot be computed, as it demands the agent knows both BetP\u1d62 and BetP\u2c7c. Fortunately, the available privacy-preserving two-party shared dot product protocol [21, 22] allows neighboring agents to obtain (BetP\u1d62, BetP\u2c7c) without knowing anything about each other's BetP. For more details about two-party shared dot product protocol implementation and its mechanism discussion, see [52].\nRemark 1. Generally, the value of n is recommended to be chosen as a positive integer as small as possible [36]. The Eq.(3) takes \u03b7 = 2 to ensure the privacy-preserving computation of DistP while reducing computational complexity. When \u03b7 = 1, the DistP is too simple to design a calculation protocol that preserves BetP.\nThe ConfP is the segmentation function of the maximal subjective probability of BetP, being zero in X^max_(m\u1d62) = X^max_(m\u2c7c), or BetP\u1d62 (X^max_(m\u1d62)) BetP\u2c7c (X^max_(m\u2c7c)) for different. Hence, it is critical to determine if the serial numbers k\u1d62 and k\u2c7c of X^max_(m\u1d62) and X^max_(m\u2c7c) are equal. In the millionaire problem [20, 34, 42], two rich men compare their assets without the help of a third party, where each richer tries to prevent his opponent from knowing his wealth, so that the solution is aptly utilized to compare whether k\u1d62 and k\u2c7c are equal while keeping the neighboring agents as far away from the exact numbered values as possible. If the numbers are equal, Agent i learns about k\u2c7c, and Agent j learns about k\u1d62 without exchanging information about BetP\u1d62 (X^max_(m\u1d62)) and BetP\u2c7c (X^max_(m\u2c7c)). If the numbers are not equal, Agent i informs Agent j about BetP\u1d62 (X^max_(m\u1d62)), and vice versa, but they do not exchange k\u2c7c and k\u1d62. This ensures the privacy of BetP, as the serial number and maximal subjective probability are not disclosed simultaneously to the other agent.\nThe following Alg.1 shows how the neighboring agents calculate neighbored EDM."}, {"title": "3.2 EDM network consensus", "content": "The absence of information sharing between non-neighbors hinders the computation of non-neighboring EDMs. Even though many evidence sources suffer from interference and measurement noise, there are still only a few pieces of evidence that contradict the correct event completely, which is why credibility is based on the \u201cmajority-minority\" principle. In other words, the differences among the majority of pieces of evidence are limited. Therefore, the matrix formed by EDMs is often row-correlated and hence brings out a somewhat low-rank property. On the principle that simpler is more reliable, the idea of low-rank/sparse matrix processing has been widely used in image processing [41], compressed sensing [48], and other fields.

A prolonged topic among us is \u201chow much is myhouse worth?\". To answer this question, most experienced agencieswould like to price a property given the factors of its attributes aswell as the demographics and the public facilities around it. How-ever, no one knows the exact prices of these factors, especially thevalues of public facilities which may help assess private properties.In this paper, we introduce our newly launched project \"Monop-oly\" (named after a classic board game) in which we propose adistributed approach for revaluing private properties by learningto price public facilities (such as hospitals etc.) with the large-scaleurban data we have accumulated via Baidu Maps. To be specific, ourmethod organizes many points of interest (POIs) into an undirectedweighted graph and formulates multiple factors including the vir-tual prices of surrounding public facilities as adaptive variables toparallelly estimate the housing prices we know. Then the prices ofboth public facilities and private properties can be iteratively up-dated according to the loss of prediction until convergence. We haveconducted extensive experiments with the large-scale urban dataof several metropolises in China. Results show that our approachoutperforms several mainstream methods with significant margins.Further insights from more in-depth discussions demonstrate thatthe \"Monopoly\" is an innovative application in the interdisciplinaryfield of business intelligence and urban computing, and it will bebeneficial to tens of millions of our users for investments and tothe governments for urban planning as well as taxation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Have you ever played the classic board game \"Monopoly\"\u00b9 whereyou can act as a tycoon to purchase all the real estates within acity? We believe that a majority of people around the world do careabout the value of their private properties. Especially when youplan to buy a new house, a prolonged question first comes intoyour mind: \"how much is the house worth?\". It is quite an attractivebut challenging topic to assess the value of private properties ac-curately [3, 5, 20, 21], as many factors will influence the housingprices. Even for experienced agencies, they may just give you somesubjective suggestions on whether or not to buy a property basedon their experiences. For example, they may recommend you topurchase school district houses (as illustrated by Figure 1) ratherthan a house with a wasteyard nearby. Why? This is because publicfacilities (such as hospitals, schools, parks, metros, police stations,wasteyards, and even cemeteries) play a pivotal role in estimatingthe value of other private properties nearby. However, this natu-rally leads to another question: \u201chow much do these public facilitiescontribute to the price of your house?\" Everybody is eager to know,but we are afraid that no one knows.\nIn this paper, we introduce our newly launched project \"Mo-nopoly\" (named after the classic board game) within Baidu Mapstoward the general public to answer the questions above. Generallyspeaking, the \"Monopoly\" project aims to assign virtual prices topublic facilities based on the values of existing private properties,and in turn, the virtual prices of public facilities can help estimatethe worth of a newly-established realty. The acquired values of pub-lic facilities, as additional features, also help alleviate the problem of very sparse prices of private properties. To achieve the ambi-tious goal of \"Monopoly\u201d, we reorganize many points of interest(POIs) into an undirected weighted graph based on the geographicinformation on the POIs that we have accumulated via Baidu Maps.In addition, we propose several models to formulate the criticalfactors that tend to influence the housing prices: i.e., the circum-stances of the property's attributes as well as the demographicsand the public facilities around it. For each POI of private property,our approach leverages these factors to regress to its ground-truthprice. As a result, the estimated values of both public facilities andprivate properties can be acquired simultaneously and updated iter-atively by the loss of regression within the graph until convergence.Driven by the large-scale urban data we have in Baidu Maps, wealso devise a distributed learning algorithm for \"Monopoly\" underthe framework of MapReduce [4] for industrial use.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments with the real-worldurban data of several metropolises (including Beijing, Shanghai,Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) in China.

This taskhas drawn much attention from our customers, business partners,and even the governments, given that it will be of great help to tensof millions of our users for investments [2, 11] and to the govern-ments for urban planning [8, 15, 26, 29] as well as taxation [20, 23].However, the definition of \"value of a POI\" is overbroad as the"}, {"title": "2.2 Data Organization", "content": "We can take advantage of the backend data in Baidu Maps, espe-cially the geographic information on POIs, the urban mobilities,and user profiles, to compose an undirected weighted graph for ametropolitan city. As illustrated by Figure 2, the private properties(residential blocks), public facilities (such as metros, schools, hospi-tals, parks, etc.), merchants, and factories are regarded as nodes inthe graph. However, the difference among the nodes is that we onlyknow the housing prices of some of the private properties leavingthe value of the other nodes unknown. This leads us to establishundirected edges between a private property and its surroundingpublic facilities within a radius of several kilometers (The value ofthe radius will become the hyperparameter of our model in the restof this paper). To measure the weights on the edges, the Euclideandistance on the map seems to be an instant answer. But citizens cantake multiple means of transport from one place to another, andthese transportation trajectories cannot be a straight line (unlessyou take a helicopter). Therefore, we also suggest taking the trajec-tory distances of various means of transportation into account asadditional weights of the edges."}, {"title": "2.3 Factor Formulation", "content": "Let us assume that you are looking for a real estate that you maypurchase for investment. What kind of factor drives you to makethe final decision? Furthermore, how are the factors formulated sothat they can rationally imply the much of deposit you should putdown? We are going to answer those questions in this subsection.By means of interviewing several professional real estate agentsand examining the urban data we have, we suggest that the price ofa private property is comprehensively influenced by the attributesof itself, as well as the demographics and the other properties(including other residential blocks and public facilities) nearby.\nGiven a private property, the basic assumption of our model isthat we use the surrounding properties (including residential blocksand public facilities) within a radius of l kilometers to assess itsvalue.

Asshown by Table 2, all the baselines are categorized into two groupsbased on 1) how we organize the data to construct the features ofprivate property, and 2) what kind of learning model we use.\nGiven a private property with its price unknown, Avg. Prices(citywide) is an oversimplified and crude way to estimate the priceof it. Macro Avg. Prices (within 1.0 km) and Micro Avg. Prices (within1.0 km) regard the prices of all the private properties within itsradius of 1.0 km as features. However, a slight difference betweenthe two baselines is the way of calculating the mean value of thetarget property. Micro Avg. Prices takes the geographical distancebetween properties into account as the additional weights to adjustthe mean price, while Macro Avg. Prices does not."}, {"title": "4.3 Evaluation Metrics", "content": "We use three kinds of evaluation metrics to assess the performanceof all the approaches on the task of housing price regression: meanaverage error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coef-ficient of determination (R\u00b2 score). The three metrics evaluate aregression model from different perspectives. Specifically speaking,MAE measures the average bias between the predicted price andthe ground-truth value of private properties, while RMSE will beamplified if some bad cases bring in a high variance. However, bothMAE and RMSE are absolute errors without considering the ground-truth housing prices. R\u00b2 score addresses the issue by measuring arelative error, and the metric stands for the degree of fitting theground-truth housing prices.\nSuppose that there are m instances of residential blocks in thetest set, and the ground-truth value of the j-th residential block isdenoted by $h^{(j)}$. Besides, we use $\\hat{h}^{(j)}$ to represent the predictedhousing price of the j-th residential block, and $\\bar{h}$ stands for themean of all the ground-truth value in the test set. According to thesymbol definitions above, here we list the formulations of the threemetrics as follows:\n\u2022 Mean Average Error (MAE):\n$MAE = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} |\\hat{h}^{(j)} - h^{(j)}|$        (6)\n\u2022 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} (\\hat{h}^{(j)} - h^{(j)})^2}$,       (7)"}, {"title": "4.4 Experimental Results", "content": "Table 2 shows the comparison results between our method on\"Monopoly\" and other baselines evaluated by the metrics of MAE,RMSE, and R2 score. All the numbers are the mean and the standarddeviation of the results of the four cities. From the results, we findout that our method adopted by the \"Monopoly\" project consis-tently outperforms all other modern approaches with significantimprovements on MAE, RMSE, and even R2 score.\nNot surprisingly, Avg. Prices (citywide) is the worst choice as themethod to assess the value of a specific realty. In line with Eq. (8),the R\u00b2 score of Avg. Prices (citywide) is close to 0.0000 in theory.Macro Avg. Prices and Micro Avg. Prices are the common practiceswidely adopted by experienced agents. However, their performanceis far from impressive, and the reason for this phenomenon is thatthe number of surrounding residential blocks with the prices weknow is quite small.\nOther methods, e.g., Linear Regression [12], Boosting trees [9, 10,17, 18], and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [19, 24], consider all thefactors including the existence of a large number of public facilitiesas features to help estimate the housing prices. The performanceof these methods gradually improves along with their capabilityincrement of discovering complex patterns. Finally, Deep NeuralNetworks (DNN) [19, 24] shows state-of-the-art performance.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art DNN methods, our approachesreduce the loss by 1,076 CNY/m\u00b2 in MAE as well as 999 CNY/m\u00b2in RMSE, and achieve the improvement by 4.56% in R\u00b2 on average2.These results meet our expectation as \"Monopoly\" can directlyleverage the acquired prices of the large number of public facilities,"}, {"title": "5 DISCUSSIONS", "content": "In this section, we will go deeper to explore the parameters (includ-ing @ which stands for the preference of property attributes, thevirtual prices of public facilities u, and $, for indicating the optionof geographical distance) and the hyperparameter (i.e., the radius l)of our model which are expected to give us more insights acquiredfrom the collective intelligence [14, 28] on the value assessment ofreal estates."}, {"title": "5.1 Preference of Property Attribute", "content": "Even though the sigmoid function we adopted (see Eq.

Furthermore, Figure 3 il-lustrates three curves about the average performance of \u201cMonopoly\u201dgraduallyincreases when I is from 0.5 km to 1.0 km, and it falls beginningwith l = 3.0 km.

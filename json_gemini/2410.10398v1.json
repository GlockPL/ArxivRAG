It should consider not only value-neutral human preferences but also moral and ethical considerations. In this study, we introduced FairMindSim, which simulates the moral dilemma through a series of unfair scenarios. We used LLM agents to simulate human behavior, ensuring alignment across various stages. To explore the various socioeconomic motivations, which we refer to as beliefs, that drive both humans and LLM agents as bystanders to intervene in unjust situations involving others, and how these beliefs interact to influence individual behavior, we incorporated knowledge from relevant sociological fields and proposed the Belief-Reward Alignment Behavior Evolution Model (BREM) based on the recursive reward model (RRM). Our findings indicate that, behaviorally, GPT-40 exhibits a stronger sense of social justice, while humans display a richer range of emotions. Additionally, we discussed the potential impact of emotions on behavior. This study provides a theoretical foundation for applications in aligning LLMs with altruistic values.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "As large language models (LLMs), also known as foundational models, increasingly engage in language comprehension and content generation tasks that resemble human capabilities, a critical and scientifically challenging question emerges: How can we ensure that these models' capabilities and behaviors align with human values, intentions, and ethical principles, thereby maintaining security and trust in human-AI collaborative processes Bengio et al. (2024)? These concerns have spurred research efforts in the field of AI alignment Bostrom (2013); Ord (2020); Bucknall & Dori-Hacohen (2022), which strives to develop AI systems that act in accordance with human intentions and values. This challenge extends across various domains, including economics, psychology Demszky et al. (2023), sociology Liu et al. (2024), and education. Additionally, human values often play a critical role in AI alignment, which we refer to as value alignment Gabriel (2020), but due to the inherently abstract and uncertain nature of human values MacIntyre (2013), they also pose additional challenges.\nRecently, one significant avenue of research has focused on examining the cognitive and reasoning competencies of large language models (LLMs), benchmarking these capabilities against human intelligence using frameworks such as Theory of Mind Strachan et al. (2024), Turing tests Mei et al. (2024), and strategic behavior assessments Sreedhar & Chilton (2024). Another prominent research direction involves the realistic simulation of social systems.

Each round has three stages: In Stage 1, Player One and Player Two each solves three simple math problems; if both answer correctly, they jointly receive a reward of 3 RMB. In Stage 2, Player One has the authority to allocate the reward between themselves and Player Two. Here, the allocation is manipulated to always be unfair (ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 RMB). Player Two can only accept the allocation proposed by Player One and cannot refuse. In Stage 3, the participant, acting as Player Three, observes the interaction between Player One and Player Two. Player Three receives 1 RMB allocated by the system for that round and has the authority to adjudicate Player One's unfair allocation. If Player Three chooses to accept, s/he retains their 1 RMB earnings for the round, and Player One and Two receive the money as proposed.

The study received ethical approval from the university's ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the experiment.\nEmotional measurement is conducted using the emotion grid Russell et al. (1989) method described by Heffner Heffner et al. (2021). Before the experiment begins, participants familiarize themselves with the approximate locations of different emotions on the emotion grid and understand the specific meanings of the X-axis representing emotional valence [-100, 100] and the Y-axis representing emotional intensity [-100, 100]. Participants are required to click on the emotion grid on the screen to report their current emotional state. Compared to multi-item scales, this emotion grid allows for a rapid assessment of the valence and intensity of a participant's emotions, minimizing the fatigue of repeated emotional assessments over multiple rounds of the game. It also enables a linear judgment of changes in emotional valence, avoiding outcomes like 'happy yet sad' Kelley et al. (2023).In each round of the game, participants are required to make three emotional reports: after learning the allocation result, before making a choice, and after making a choice. After the game ends, demographic information (gender, age) of the participants is collected, along with scores on psychological health risk indicators, including scores on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Hoekstra et al. (2011)and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) Zung (1965)."}, {"title": "3.1.3 LLM AGENTS SETTING", "content": "In our study, we set up our experiments with the CAMEL Li et al.

In the experiment, we define the ID of an agent to correspond directly with a human, that is, an agent and a human with the same ID share an identical persona definition. The role of the ID is simply to differentiate between individuals. Appendix Table 5 displays different IDs for humans and agents participating in various experiments. The term \"different experiments\" refers solely to inconsistencies in the allocation schemes of each round in the economic game, with each experiment consisting of 20 rounds. Different experiments signify varying degrees of fairness, as detailed in Figure 2.

(2018). Based on the concept of recursive reward modeling Leike et al. (2018); Hubinger (2020), we proposed the Belief-Reward Alignment Behavior Evolution Model (BREM), as shown in Figure 3. This model is used to study and simulate how individuals or systems maximize rewards by leveraging beliefs in dynamic environments. It continuously adjusts behaviors to achieve better alignment and optimization between beliefs and rewards. In this process, individuals continuously update their beliefs about the state of the environment and their own behaviors by receiving and processing new information. Over time, the model achieves a dynamic balance and optimization of beliefs, behaviors, and reward systems, allowing us to analyze the differences in self-belief strength and belief variations among different types of individuals. In this scenario, we refer to factors that are not related to rewards but still impact subsequent behavior as beliefs Rouault et al. (2019), specifically the beliefs of fairness and justice.\nThe cumulative reward function(CRF) \\(R_{i,j}(i, y)\\) for each individual i during each trial j is defined by Equation 1. The function \\(P_{i,j}(y)\\) represents the reward policy function for the game, acceptance means \\(r_{i,j}(y = 0|i) = 1\\) and rejection means \\(r_{i,j}(y = 1|i) = 0\\), and y corresponds to the choice in the game setup, which is a binary decision determined by \\(Y_w\\) and \\(Y_l\\), the probability of \\(Y_w\\) being preferred over \\(Y_l\\), denoted as \\(P(y = 0 | i) = P_{i,j}(Y_w > Y_l | i)\\).\nRecent research Wu et al. (2024) into the Motive Cocktail presents an integrative framework that considers seven different motivations, resulting in a complex mix of motives, Motivations beyond rewards are termed beliefs. When there is a misalignment between these beliefs and the pursuit of incentives, We call this discrepancy the Cognitive Function (CF) as shown in Equation 2 to elucidate the relationship between the belief and the Cognitive Reward Function (CRF) of the j 1th trial and the inherent characteristics of the jth trial, Following ref. Gavrilets Gavrilets (2021). This also takes into account the reward difference caused by behavior Payoff and the level of unfairness in the environment \\(E_i\\), which affects beliefs. We posit that there exist two independent parameters, \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\), which exert distinct influences on the belief and CRF of the j 1th trial, respectively."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 BEHAVIORAL REWARD RESULTS", "content": "The overall score for a specific type, denoted as SD where D represents categories such as human, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-40, is calculated by summing the final rewards of all individuals i belonging to that type after the last trial J. Specifically, the overall score is defined as \\(S_D = \\sum_{i \\in D} R_{i, J}\\).\nThe results presented in Table 2 demonstrate the reward scores and total scores for each group across different genders and conditions. Figure 4a illustrates the overall rejection and missing rates for the various groups. Figure 4b shows the rejection rates for each group under different conditions, while Figure 4c highlights the rejection rates for each group based on gender differences. Notably, the rejection rate is negatively correlated with the policy reward score, meaning that a higher rejection rate corresponds to a lower-and arguably more ethical-score.\nThe comparative analysis of various LLMs in terms of rejection rates in response to unfair behaviors reveals significant differences in their alignment with societal values. GPT-40 demonstrates a notably higher willingness to address actions that deviate from fairness, with rejection rates exceeding those of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo across different experimental conditions. This heightened response likely reflects GPT-40's enhanced capability to align with societal notions of justice and fairness. In contrast, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo show relatively lower rejection rates, suggesting that these models may have more limited abilities to consistently interpret and react in accordance with societal values. These results underscore the importance of refining AI's alignment with human ethics, particularly in contexts that demand fairness and equitable behavior.\nIt is worth noting that in the human group, the refusal rate among females is higher than that of males, indicating that females are more willing to display courage in such scenarios. However, among the large language models (LLMs), the refusal rate is higher for males than females, suggesting that males in the LLM simulations are more inclined to be courageous. This difference highlights a form of gender disparity between human responses and those simulated by LLMs."}, {"title": "4.2 EMOTIONAL COMPARISON RESULTS", "content": "We normalize the valence \\(V_{i,j} = V_{i,j,1} \\cup V_{i,j,2} \\cup V_{i,j,3}\\) and arousal \\(A_{i,j} = A_{i,j,1} \\cup A_{i,j,2} \\cup A_{i,j,3}\\) values to a range [0, 1]. Using the normalized valence \\(V_i = \\cup_j(V_{i, j})\\) and arousal \\(A_i = \\cup_j(A_{i, j})\\), compute the probability distribution for valence and arousal. Typically, this involves creating a histogram from the data and normalizing it to form a probability distribution. In this context, p(b) represents the probability associated with each bin b, and b \u2208 BE denotes that the bin b is an element of the set of bins BE used for the combined valence and arousal data, and E\u2081 = V \u222a A. For each individual i, we use the following Equation 9 to calculate the entropy of valence and arousal."}, {"title": "4.3 BELIEF RESULTS", "content": "In the scenario where decision-making is unaffected by emotions, Figure 6a shows that the overall belief distribution is highest for GPT-40. The distribution for GPT-40 is slightly higher than that for humans. As evolution progresses, human belief values tend to decrease, indicating a reduced steadfastness in maintaining choices. In contrast, GPT-40's beliefs remain relatively stable. For GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo, initially, GPT-3.5 had higher belief values than GPT-4 Turbo. However, as the evolution continued, belief values for GPT-4 Turbo surpassed those of GPT-3.5. Despite these changes, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo consistently demonstrated a lower overall belief distribution compared to humans and GPT-40. When considering the inclusion of emotions, Figure 6b shows that when emotions are incorporated into BERM in the form of temperature (T), human beliefs exhibit significant fluctuations. In contrast, the beliefs of other LLMs show no significant difference compared to when emotional factors are not considered, though they eventually stabilize. Additionally, from the heatmap of behavior and belief, it can be seen that without considering emotions as in Figure 7a, there is no significant correlation between human behavior and belief, whereas LLMs show a significant correlation between behavior and belief. When emotions are considered, as in Figure 7b, all four display a significant correlation between behavior and belief.\nInterestingly, in the BERM for both humans and LLMs, there is a relationship where \\(\\beta_1 > \\beta_2\\), indicating that beliefs influence decision-making more than rewards do. Overall, GPT-40 demonstrates higher belief stability both with and without emotional influence and maintains higher belief values in fairness and justice. Emotional factors have a significant impact on fluctuations in human beliefs, whereas the performance of LLMs remains relatively stable."}, {"title": "4.4 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HUMAN AND LLM RESULTS", "content": "From the behavioral perspective, GPT-4o exhibits a higher sense of social value, followed by humans, which is consistent with the findings in Wilbanks et al.

These include beliefs in integrity and honesty, respect for others, cooperation, compassion, and charity. Also included are beliefs in fairness and justice. In terms of value alignment, we believe that discussions about aligning these beliefs should begin with specific task design and involve collaboration with fields such as sociology. We simultaneously considered the impact of emotions on decision-making and found that humans are more influenced by emotions in their behaviour.

Weather predictions are directly tied to human existence including business, industry, transportation, and cultural-leisure activities globally Agyekum et al. [2022]. Weather forecasting is becoming increasingly difficult but still necessary due to the severity of climate change Panteli and Mancarella [2015]. Extreme weather events, formerly thought to be uncommon, are becoming more frequent and intense due to substantial changes in our atmosphere Barry and Chorley [2009]. More advanced and precise weather prediction methods must be developed to protect companies and communities from the unpredictable effects of climate change. FourCastNet, ClimaX, GraphCast, Fengwu, Fuxi, Pangu, and KARIN are representative models that are transforming weather prediction Pathak et al. [2022]Nguyen et al. [2023]Bi et al. [2023]Lam et al. [2023]Chen et al. [2023]Cheon et al. [2024]. To improve forecast accuracy, these complicated models include input variables from ERA5, a massive database of meteorological observations Tarek et al. [2020].\nHowever, despite prompt advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, there is a considerable vacuum in models created particularly for synoptic weather map analysis Lagerquist et al. [2019]. Synoptic weather maps are important in meteorology because they provide a thorough picture of weather conditions across a large horizontal distance of"}, {"title": "2 Materials and Methods", "content": "Ahn et al. offered a deep learning strategy that uses convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to help weather forecasters detect previous weather maps like current ones. By converting satellite photos into low-dimensional vectors, the model detects dates with weather circumstances similar to a particular reference date using Euclidean distances between their latent feature vectors. For the given work, the CAE model outperformed typical pre-trained CNN models in terms of feature extraction. However, the research acknowledged the subjective aspect of visual similarity, pointing out that it does not necessarily match meteorological similarity. To test the feasibility of this strategy, the researchers analyzed meteorological variables such as wind speed and direction across multiple days. Finally, our strategy aims to help forecasters obtain important historical data more rapidly, enhancing the empirical analysis and accuracy of current weather forecasts Ahn et al. [2023].\nKang et al. concentrated on building distributed parallel methods for training deep neural network models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accelerate the extraction of comparable weather maps, which is critical for effective and fast weather forecasting. They compared the performance of various algorithms in both single and multi-node systems, with numbers of GPUs. It discovered that while employing several GPUs could considerably reduce training time, adding additional nodes in a distributed environment could increase training time owing to network overhead. The conclusion reiterated similar findings, highlighting the efficiency of parallel processing in single-node, multi-GPU configurations for training deep learning models in weather forecasting applications Kang et al. [2018].\nHakii et al. suggested a novel method for predicting weather maps by extracting RGB metaphorical features from atmospheric pressure patterns. This unique technology utilized machine learning to autonomously produce predict weather maps, combining meteorologists' knowledge with observational data. The technique took atmospheric pressure information from current weather maps and converted them to RGB metaphorical gradation maps before employing pix2pix to predict future weather images. The experimental results validated the proposed method's ability to forecast the weather, yielding the possibility of generating predictive weather maps automatically. However, the authors also recognized the need for additional improvement in illustrating pressure patterns and investigating extended forecast capabilities Hakii et al. [2021].\nZhang et al. employed deep learning convolutional neural networks and the YOLO V3 models to improve rainfall forecast accuracy by identifying high-altitude, low-pressure vortices on weather maps. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by its integration with the MICAPS platform, which enabled forecasters to leverage MICAPS data for real-time database modifications. While the study did not specify the actual amount of data points utilized in the experiment, it did highlight the enhanced accuracy of rainfall forecasts using this strategy. This finding underlined the relationship between the forecaster's operating system competency and the capacity to access updated data from MICAPS in real-time Zhang et al. [2021].\nFang et al. addressed the importance of deep learning for predicting extreme weather occurrences. Due to the unexpected nature and complexity of atmospheric motions, forecasting severe weather is a difficult meteorological challenge. Deep learning approaches, which can learn from huge amounts of data, have proven performance in various tasks. Fang et al. summarized known approaches for extreme weather prediction, by emphasizing employing recurrent neural networks"}, {"title": "3 Materials and Methods", "content": "The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) creates synoptic weather maps for the East Asian area focused on the Korean Peninsula (KP), from surface to vertical level height (Ground Diary, n.d.), as seen in Figure 1. The 500 hPa pressure level, located around 5.5 km above sea level and related to the troposphere's middle layer (Mohanakumar et al., 2008), is significant in these analyses. Analyzing weather patterns at this altitude is very important because it provides insights into atmospheric behavior without being influenced by surface friction or excessive vertical movements. Meteorologists analyze long and short waves in the middle troposphere to identify pressure troughs or ridges and understand the development or decay of weather systems. Therefore, for our experiment, the dataset was downloaded from the Korea Meteorological Administration. It includes the geopotential height (GPH) in meters, representing vertical height from sea level at the 500 hPa pressure altitude plane using solid blue lines with 60-meter intervals. Additionally, temperature in degrees Celsius is indicated by red dashed lines with 5\u00b0C intervals. Wind information is conveyed through black wind barbs in knots. Local high and low-pressure areas are marked by a blue \"H\" and red \"L,\" while local high and low-temperature regions are identified by a red \"W\" and blue \"C,\" respectively."}, {"title": "3.2 ConvNeXt", "content": "ConvNeXt represents a significant advancement in convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, distinguishing itself from Transformer-based models like ViT and Swin Transformer. This model is differentiated from using patch embedding or attention, which is a common feature in Transformer architectures, and instead optimizes the traditional CNN approach. It combines traditional CNN architecture with elements inspired by the Swin Transformer's block structures. This hybrid approach allows it to utilize the strengths of both CNNs and Transformers. Additionally, ConvNeXt adopts a training strategy from Swin Transformer, that further enhances its performance, particularly in complex computer vision tasks. With these modifications, the ConvNeXt achieved higher performance compared to that of the Swin Transformer, or VIT Liu et al. [2022]. In the field of meteorological analysis, interpreting synoptic weather maps requires a sophisticated comprehension of both small-scale and large-scale spatial interactions. The complex patterns of isobars, fronts, and symbols call for a model that can identify minute elements and place them in a larger meteorological situation. Conventional CNNs are good at identifying local characteristics like edges and textures, but they can be ineffective in capturing the long-range relationships that are present in weather systems. On the other hand, without substantial pre-training, Vision Transformers (ViTs) may fail to recognize the importance of local spatial hierarchies despite their superior modeling of these global interconnections Xu et al. [2021]. It also takes over Transformer models' global receptive field, which enables a comprehensive understanding of weather processes over the whole map. ConvNeXt is guaranteed to be sensitive to both the minute atmospheric characteristics and the complex web of interactions that characterize synoptic weather patterns because of its dual capacity. Furthermore, ConvNeXt's training approach is designed to leverage these architectural advantages with a routine that highlights its two advantages. ConvNeXt is taught to recognize intricate patterns and correlations that are crucial for weather forecasting and research by utilizing current algorithmic advancements. The application of it in our research is strongly supported by its state-of-the-art performance in computer vision benchmarks, which highlights its potential to greatly improve meteorological data interpretation. All things considered, ConvNeXt is an excellent candidate for the complex task of synoptic weather map analysis as it is an ideal combination of inductive biases from both CNNs and ViTs Thuemmel et al. [2023]."}, {"title": "3.3 AutoEncoder", "content": "Due to their unique design and data processing powers, autoencoders a subset of neural networks-show remarkably high efficacy in identifying similarities across datasets Ardelean et al. [2023]. The encoder, which compresses incoming data into a compressed, lower-dimensional representation, and the decoder, which reconstructs the data from its compressed form, are the two primary components of this architecture. Autoencoders can preserve important characteristics while removing unnecessary information due to this compression of high-dimensional data into a more useful format Bank et al. [2023]. As a result, the design not only simplifies data but also highlights its most important characteristics, improving the accuracy with which patterns and similarities may be found. In synoptic meteorology, where labeled datasets are often scarce, analogous weather maps can be found by utilizing autoencoders' built-in feature extraction capabilities. Fundamentally, an autoencoder's ability to learn self-representation relies on its ability to compress high-dimensional meteorological data into a small latent space, capturing significant atmospheric properties like temperature variations, pressure configurations, and hygrometric distributions Tschannen et al. [2018]. The encoder portion aims to embed these notable characteristics into a lower dimension's subspace, while the decoder component tries to recreate the original synoptic maps. This reconstruction requires the preservation of meteorological characteristics required for synoptic analysis. Therefore, the autoencoder gains proficiency in identifying subtle relationships between weather maps, which is essential when dealing with novel or never-before-seen meteorological input. Given the autoencoder's capability of creating condensed feature vectors, it is possible to locate nearby weather maps in this latent space and employ closest-neighbor search techniques to find synoptic alternates. This unsupervised approach avoids the tedious process of data annotation, which is highly beneficial for meteorological undertakings. Autoencoders apply the self-representation principle to facilitate the grouping of synoptic maps, which advances the identification and integration of meteorological trends in large-scale historical data archives. It is expected that this method would improve the scope and accuracy of meteorological evaluations, simplifying the process of rapidly identifying significant weather patterns without the need for particular labeling. There are important ramifications for weather forecasting, serving as a beacon for timely and informed decision-making in the face of shifting atmospheric dynamics."}, {"title": "3.4 VQ-VAE", "content": "The VQ-VAE method combines classic Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) with vector quantization approaches. It takes advantage of VAEs' capabilities to produce high-quality, diversified outputs while resolving some limitations through vector quantization. VQ-VAEs have the same encoder-decoder construction as normal VAEs. The encoder compresses the input data into a latent space representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original input from this latent space. The key distinguishing feature of VQ-VAEs is the use of a discrete latent space. The continuous output of the encoder is quantized into a finite set of vectors (a codebook), and the nearest vector in this codebook represents each input. This quantization phase promotes more stable training and yields higher-quality outcomes, especially in situations where data is naturally classified into discrete categories. Three separate loss functions used to train the VQ-VQE are reconstruction loss, codebook loss, and commitment loss, respectively. The reconstruction loss denotes how well the decoder can reconstruct the original input from the quantized latent representations. A lower reconstruction loss indicates better performance. The role of the codebook loss is to ensure that the codebook vectors effectively represent the data, a loss is applied to make sure that each vector in the codebook is as close as possible to the encoder's output. For the last, the commitment loss encourages the encoder to produce outputs close to the codebook vectors, ensuring stability and consistency in the mapping Van Den Oord and Vinyals [2017]. The core strength of a VQ-VAE lies in its ability to compress complex, high-dimensional meteorological data into a discrete and compact latent space. It excels in capturing critical atmospheric features like pressure systems, temperature gradients, and moisture distributions. In a VQ-VAE, the encoder reduces these key meteorological characteristics to a lower-dimensional subspace, while the decoder attempts to recover the original synoptic maps from this compressed representation. This reconstruction procedure is critical because it assures the preservation of essential meteorological properties required for effective synoptic analysis. As a result, the VQ-VAE improves its ability to recognize complex correlations between multiple weather maps, which is critical for studying fresh or previously unheard meteorological data. The discrete character of the latent space in VQ-VAEs, which is represented by a finite collection of vectors or 'codebook', enables the effective localization of comparable weather maps. Synoptic analogs may be easily identified by using nearest-neighbor search algorithms in this quantized latent space."}, {"title": "4 Result", "content": "Our research evaluated an array of state-of-the-art pre-trained deep learning models to ascertain their efficacy in identifying synoptic weather map patterns. In the first phase, we utilized models famous for their image classification performance, such as VGG16 and VGG19 [28]. We also examined models like as Xception and InceptionV3, which have more sophisticated and efficient architectures, as well as ResNet50, which is well-known for its residual learning framework, which allows for the training of deeper networks [29][30][31]. We also used EfficientNet models, including EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB1, which are known for their scalable design and balance of accuracy and efficiency [32]. For the most recent phases, EfficientNetV2B0 and EfficientNetV2B1, which enhance training speed and parameter efficiency, were used [33]. Most importantly, we included the ConvNeXtTiny and ConvNeXtBase models in our research. ConvNeXt's hybrid design, which drew on the capabilities of both CNNs and Transformers, served as a focal point for comparison due to its current architecture and cutting-edge performance on a range of computer vision applications. We then used our dataset to train an autoencoder that we had previously deployed. Lastly, we used three evaluation metrics: cosine similarity, structural similarity index (SSIM), and root mean square error (RMSE). Our goal was to determine which metric best matches a meteorologist's perspective when searching for comparable synoptic weather maps."}, {"title": "4.1 Results from Convolutional Autoencoder", "content": "The input data for the experiment is the 500 hPa synoptic weather map at 00 UTC on December 19, 2022. In the examination of five historical weather maps generated by the proposed autoencoder model results, notable patterns emerge. The result yielded that based on the metrics about SSIM, and RMSE, even though the given input is the December data, they described the result from September, and even from the summer. It could be inferred that those metrics failed to figure out the similar ones effectively, which means that it might not be suitable to use those metrics for this task. However, the results from cosine similarity showed much more ideal results compared to other metrics used above and those results are described in Figure 4. Firstly, closed low-pressure systems, as previously mentioned, are consistently distributed in similar geographic locations across these maps. Furthermore, the positions of troughs and ridges resulting from Rossby wave dynamics exhibit remarkable similarities. One noteworthy observation is the presence of a trough around the KP (Key Point) region, resulting in a distinct narrow effect on geopotential height (GPH) and temperature lines. When assessing these results on a ranked scale from 1 to 5, the top-ranking result, designated as number 1, stands out for accurately depicting both the number and location of closed low-pressure systems with cold cores, as well as the position of the COL (Cut-Off Low) point. Furthermore, the result's trough east of KP is in good agreement with the temperature and wind pattern distribution seen in the input weather map. Two troughs are seen around the KP region in the second-ranked result (number 2), which leads to a more noticeable pressure gradient and, in turn, more violent winds. Wider gaps in the GPH and temperature lines surrounding KP are observed in the third-ranked result (number 3), which is explained by a trough that lies farther east. The fourth result shows that a brief wave trough is moving eastward and is about to strike KP. The north-south temperature gradient on KP looks to be a little weaker in this finding. Lastly, finding number 5 differs from the others in that it shows that the trough is getting closer to KP rather than having crossed it yet. These evaluations collectively indicate that while variations exist among the ranked results, the model is adept at identifying historical weather maps that bear striking similarities to the current input, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of weather patterns. Furthermore, with this analysis, we could figure out that the most suitable metric for discovering a similar synoptic weather map is the cosine similarity, as shown in Table 1."}, {"title": "4.2 Results from VQ-VAE", "content": "We next used the VQ-VQE to the same dataset for comparison, as the Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is not a novel method. The general approach is very similar since, as previously said, this method also includes an encoder and a decoder. Initially, we were able to locate the rebuilt pictures after VQ-VQE training. Following data processing by the VQ-VAE's encoder and decoder network, Figure 5's reconstructed image on the right aims to replicate these properties. The visual examination indicates that the rebuilt map is identical to the original in terms of general arrangement and meteorological data placement. The isobars appear to preserve their relative shapes and trajectories, and the high and low-pressure systems are evident in positions consistent with the original map. However, because the VQ-VAE compresses and reconstructs the input data into a lower-dimensional latent representation before creating the output, there may be minor changes in the smoothness of the lines or subtle differences in the details.\nFigure 6 depicts a comparison between an original synoptic weather map and its corresponding encoded representation, termed here as \"Code.\" With distinctive meteorological features like isobars-curved lines that indicate areas of equal atmospheric pressure-and symbols for high-pressure (designated with an 'H') and low-pressure (marked with an 'L') systems, the left panel, titled \"Original,\" displays a comprehensive synoptic weather map. On the right, the panel labeled \"Code\" displays the encoded version of the weather map as processed by a VQ-VAE model. This representation is shown as a grid of colored squares, with each color denoting a unique vector found in the codebook of the model. The variety of hues points to a rich encoding of the properties of the map into a separate, lower-dimensional latent space. This encoded form abstracts the continuous data from the weather map into a format that may be used by the model for pattern recognition, similarity searches, or reconstruction of the input data.\nA series of synoptic weather maps are shown in Figure 7, with the first map designated as the \"Anchor\" and the remaining maps, labeled 1 through 5, being determined to be comparable to the anchor map by a high cosine similarity score of 0.98. Even with the high similarity ratings, there are still observable discrepancies between the maps regarding synoptic aspects such as pressure system location and form, isobar configuration, and frontal boundary depiction. The subtleties and complexity that a meteorologist would take into account in a real-world situation are not sufficiently reflected in the parallels that the quantitative score suggests. This mismatch demonstrates the limitations of using cosine similarity scores alone to evaluate synoptic weather map similarity. The ratings may not fully convey the expert judgment needed for proper meteorological analysis, which frequently requires a more nuanced and context-specific interpretation of the data. The model's evaluation cannot entirely replace the qualitative aspects required for operational forecasting, which include the specific configuration and interplay of meteorological variables."}, {"title": "4.3 Results from Imagenet-based Pretraiend Models", "content": "We used an experimental approach in this work, using pretrained deep learning models for analytical comparison-a methodology that has been used in comparable studies. Our method was applying these advanced models to a dataset that had been specifically preprocessed. First, five well-known models\u2014VGG16, VGG19, Xception, Inception V3, and ResNet50-were chosen for this task. The choice of ImageNet, despite its stark contrast to the unique characteristics of synoptic weather maps, was strategic. Our dataset, after undergoing preprocessing, primarily featured line representa-tions of images. This conversion led us to suppose that the information acquired from ImageNet's massive collection of photos would still be practical and valuable in this case. The majority of the pictures in our sample were represented as lines following preprocessing. This conversion led us to believe that the insights gathered from ImageNet's large picture collection will remain relevant and useful.\nFurthermore, we took inspiration from prior studies that demonstrated the importance of cosine similarity as an analytical measure. As a result, we narrowed our emphasis to one specific parameter, hoping to draw the most significant comparisons across model results. Our investigation produced intriguing findings. For example, the VGG16 and VGG19 models produced findings in March and April. This discovery was intriguing, but it did not fully meet our expectations because the target photographs were from December. Xception, InceptionV3, and ResNet, on the other hand, were more closely matched with the desired timeframe, with outputs largely occurring in November and October. This result indicated a more sophisticated knowledge of the models' capabilities and applicability to different types of datasets, particularly when considering the temporal characteristics of the data they were trained to comprehend. We have included several more recent models, such as EfficientNetB0, EfficinetNetB1, EfficientNetV2B0, Efficient-NetV2B1, ConvNeXtTiny, and ConvNeXBase, in our thorough investigation of pre-trained deep learning models.  Figures 13 to 18 reveal that these models produced datasets primarily from October and November, which is intriguing and suggests that they performed better than the models VGG16 and VGG19. Their more recent development may have contributed to their better performance, indicating that more current models may produce more accurate findings.

It introduces a novel data processing approach designed for synoptic weather map difficulties. To find the most similar maps, a variety of deep learning models were used, including cutting-edge models such as ConvNext. By combining these innovative algorithms and contrasting multiple approaches, this study significantly improved on past research. Incorporating meteorologists' qualitative remarks was particularly important in confirming the findings of the deep learning models. However, this work recognizes a significant limitation: relying entirely on deep learning models imposes some limits, especially because the differential in scores produced by these models is not always evident. This uncertainty demands the cooperation of meteorologists to have a more thorough knowledge and accurate forecast. As a result, the suggested technique should be considered a decision support system rather than a stand-alone solution. Our model-based decision support system will easily interact with existing meteorological tools, providing real-time data analysis and suggestions. It will use sophisticated analytics to quickly detect patterns and connections in weather data, giving meteorologists a better grasp of synoptic weather maps. Future studies will focus on improving this decision support system's flexibility, user experience, and interaction with a larger set of meteorological tools."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "The objective of this paper was to use synoptic weather map analysis a vital meteorological technique for depicting comprehensive weather conditions over large areas to bridge the gap between the weather prediction model and real forecast operations. Detailed techniques are needed to provide accurate and dependable weather forecasts due to the distinct manner in which synoptic maps depict atmospheric conditions. As a result, we suggested an Autoencoder-based technique that can recognize past weather maps that closely match the situation as it is right now. This model is a technical development in meteorology that aims to improve forecasting by fusing cutting-edge technological capabilities with conventional meteorological information. We also experimented with a Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to investigate the use of deep learning to synoptic weather map processing. Our research, however, showed that the VQ-VAE did not perform as well as a conventional convolutional autoencoder. This may be explained by the inherent qualities of synoptic weather maps, which are full of smooth and constant changes in meteorological components. The discrete latent space of the VQ-VAE does not capture these continuous properties as well. Several pre-trained deep learning models were used; initially, the focus was on models like VGG16, VGG19, Xception, Inception V3, and ResNet50 that were trained on the diverse ImageNet dataset. It's interesting to note that the study showed that certain models fit more closely with the targeted schedule than others. This led to the conclusion that although these pre-trained models show impressive performance in a variety of settings, they may not be as effective in specialized tasks such as recognizing identical synoptic weather images.\nOur analysis was also extended to incorporate more recent models, such as EfficientNet and ConvNeXt. Even with their enhanced powers, these models also highlighted an important discovery: their consistency in recognizing similar images, probably because of their initial training on ImageNet, indicated a constraint in their ability to adapt to datasets that differ greatly from ImageNet, like synoptic weather maps. Our study also shows the potential of deep learning methods for finding similar synoptic weather maps and provides a baseline for applying deep learning models to the synoptic weather map, especially estimating the metric, data preprocessing method, and comparing the various models. The incorporation of qualitative evaluations from meteorologists confirmed the outcomes of the deep learning models, emphasizing the need for combining computer techniques with knowledgeable human opinion for thorough analysis. Our work proposes a novel data pretreatment technique and relevant criteria for synoptic weather map analysis, representing a significant step forward in meteorological forecasting utilizing artificial intelligence.

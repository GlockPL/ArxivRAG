Introduction", "content": "The need for automatic summarization has increased substan-tially with the exponential growth of textual data. Automatic summarization generates a concise document that contains key concepts and relevant information from the original document [1, 2]. Based on the texts of the generated summaries, we can characterize summarization into two types: extractive and ab-stractive. In extractive text summarization, the generated sum-mary is made up of content directly extracted from the source text [3], whereas in abstractive text summarization, the concise summary contains the source text's salient ideas in the newly generated text. The generated summary potentially contains different phrases and sentences that are not present in the origi-nal text [2].\nAlthough the extractive method has long been used for sum-mary generation, the abstractive approach has recently gained popularity because of its ability to generate new sentences that better capture the main concepts of the original text, mimicking how humans write summaries. This change in emphasis is due to the maturity of extractive summarization techniques and the desire to push boundaries and address capability limitations, which leaves the dynamic and largely uncharted field of abstrac-tive summarization open to further research and advancement [3].\nTo set the stage for continued progress in this emerging field, it is crucial to outline the characteristics that make an automatic summary not just functional but exceptional. A high-quality automatically generated summary should possess the following properties [4, 5, 6, 7]:\n\u2022 Concise: A high-quality summary should effectively con-vey the most important information from the original source while keeping the length brief.\n\u2022 Relevant: The information presented in the summary should be relevant to the main topic.\n\u2022 Coherent: A good summary should have a clear structure and flow of ideas that make it easy to understand and follow.\n\u2022 Accurate: The summary's information should be factually correct and should not contain false or misleading infor-mation.\n\u2022 Non-redundant: Summary sentences should not repeat in-formation.\n\u2022 Readable: The sentences used in the summary should be easily understood by the target audience."}, {"title": "1.1. Prior Surveys on Abstractive Summarization", "content": "Several prior surveys have explored the developments in auto-matic summarization methods. These survey papers offer vital insights into the methods, limitations, and potential future re-search directions in automatic summarization. A significant portion of these surveys, such as those conducted by Nazari et al. [28], and Moratanch et al. [29], primarily focused on ex-tractive summarization methods. This focus can be attributed to the complexity inherent in abstractive summarization. In recent years, a growing body of work has concentrated on the state of the art in abstractive summarization. For instance, Suleiman et al. [30], Zhang et al.[31], and Gupta et al. [32] have exclu-sively focused on abstractive text summarization. These studies delve into deep learning-based abstractive summarization meth-ods and compare performance on widely used datasets. Lin et al. [33] explored existing neural approaches to abstractive summarization, while Gupta et al. [32] characterized abstrac-tive summarization strategies, highlighting the difficulties, tools, benefits, and drawbacks of various approaches. Syed et al.

Examples of such works include Gupta et al. [35] and Mahajani et al. [36]. These studies offer a comparative examination of the effectiveness of both extractive and abstractive techniques as well as giving an overview of both. Ermakova et al.

These works go about as an extension between the two summarization approaches, displaying their individual benefits and possible cooperative synergies.\nPrevious research on automatic summarization has oftentimes focused on specific topics, for example, abstractive summariza-tion utilizing neural approaches, deep learning-based models, sequence-to-sequence based models, and extractive summariza-"}, {"title": "1.2.

Automatic Summmarization", "content": "Automatic summarization is a technique used in Natural Lan-guage Processing (NLP) to generate a condensed version of a longer text document while retaining the most important infor-mation [4]. The aim of automatic summarization is to reduce the length of the text without losing the essence of the source con-tent. The primary purpose of summarization is to help people get a quick understanding of the main topics and ideas cov-ered in a large text document without having to read the entire document. As mentioned at the beginning of the paper, there are two main types of automatic summarization: extractive and abstractive summarization [28]. A fundamental comparison be-tween extractive and abstractive summarization techniques is presented in Table 2."}, {"title": "2.1. Extractive Summarization", "content": "Extractive summarization is the process that entails cherry-picking the most salient sentences or phrases from the source text and fusing them into a summary [44]. The chosen sen-tences or phrases typically include important details pertaining to the subject being discussed. Extractive summarization re-frains from any form of paraphrasing or rewriting of the source text. Instead, it highlights and consolidates the text's most cru-cial information in a literal way. For instance, Google News utilizes an extractive summarization tool that sifts through news articles and generates a summary by pulling out the most rel-evant sentences [45]. Table 3 presents an extractive summary of a source text, which was obtained from the United Nations Climate Action website\u00b9.

Abstractive Summarization", "content": "Abstractive summarization involves creating a summary that is not just a selection of sentences or phrases from the source text, but is compromised of newly minted sentences that capture the essence of the original text [46]. The model generates new sentences that maintain the original text's meaning but are usually shorter and more to the point in order to achieve the abstraction of ideas. Abstractive summarization is more complex than extractive summarization because it necessitates the NLP model to comprehend the text's meaning and generate new sentences. The New York Times summary generator, which generates summaries that are very similar to those written by humans, is a great example of abstractive summarization. Table 3 showcases an abstractive summary of the source text, sourced from the United Nations Climate Action website.

At a funda-mental conceptual level, summarization consists of transform-ing a long sequence of sentences or paragraphs into a con-cise sequence of sentences. Thus, all machine learning models that learn to perform summarization can be characterized as Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models. However, Seq2Seq models encompass a wide variety of approaches, one of which we call Traditional Seq2Seq models in the taxonomy. We clas-sify state-of-the-art abstractive text summarization into five dis-tinct categories: Traditional Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) based Models [8], Pre-trained Large Language Models [10, 11], Reinforcement Learning (RL) Approaches [12, 13], Hierar-"}, {"title": "3.1. Traditional Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models", "content": "Traditional Seq2Seq models are a class of neural network archi-tectures developed to map input sequences to output sequences. They are frequently employed in tasks involving the processing of natural languages, such as summarization and machine trans-lation. The fundamental concept is to first use an encoder to turn the input sequence into a fixed-length vector representation and then to use a decoder to generate the output sequence from the vector representation [8]. The sequence diagram in Figure 2 illustrates the flow of traditional Seq2Seq models, emphasizing their significance and applications in the realm of abstractive text summarization. To provide a more comprehensive under-standing of Seq2Seq models in the context of abstractive text summarization, we have further divided them into four sub-classes: Basic Seq2Seq Models, Attention Mechanisms, Copy Mechanisms, and Pointer Networks. This classification makes it possible to give a clearer analysis of the various methods used in Seq2Seq models for abstractive text summarization.

Basic Seq2Seq models", "content": "Basic Seq2Seq models, first introduced by Sutskever et al. [8], utilize the encoder-decoder architecture to generate sum-maries. Although machine translation was the model's primary application, the Seq2Seq framework has since been used for ab-stractive text summarization. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Seq2Seq model for natural language phrases was proposed by Hu et al. [47]. Although the paper's primary focus was on matching phrases, the basic Seq2Seq model presented can be adapted for abstractive text summarization. However, these basic models face limitations in capturing long-range de-pendencies, leading to the development of attention mechanisms [20]."}, {"title": "3.1.2. Attention Mechanisms", "content": "Attention mechanisms enable models to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input during the decoding phase, improv-ing the generated summaries' quality. A novel neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization was proposed by Rush et al. [48]. The task of creating a condensed version of an input sentence while maintaining its core meaning is called a single-sentence summary, which was the focus of this study. This research is considered a trailblazer since it was among the first to use attention mechanisms for abstractive text summa-rization. The proposed model was based on an encoder-decoder framework. The encoder is a CNN that processes the input sentence, while the decoder is a feed-forward Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) that generates the summary. The decoder has an attention mechanism that allows it to selectively concentrate on various sections of the input text while generat-ing the summary. As a result, the model may learn which words or phrases of the input text are crucial for generating the sum-mary. A \"hard\" attention model and a \"soft\" attention model were the two variations of the attention model tested by the au-thors. The soft attention model computes a weighted average of the input words, with the weights representing the relevance of each word to the summary, whereas the hard attention model stochastically chooses a restricted group of input words to be included in the summary. The soft attention model performed better in the experiments because it makes it easier for gradi-ents to flow during training. The proposed model was evaluated on the Gigaword dataset [49], a large-scale corpus of news ar-ticles with associated headlines. The results showed that the attention-based model outperformed a number of baselines, in-cluding the fundamental Seq2Seq model and a state-of-the-art extractive summarization system. The experiments also showed that the model could generate concise and coherent summaries that capture the core idea of the input text.\nAn attentive encoder-decoder architecture for abstractive sen-tence summarization was proposed by Chopra et al. [50], focusing on generating abstractive summaries for single sen-tences. By using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as the foundation for both the encoder and decoder components in the Seq2Seq model, the paper extended the earlier work by Rush et al. [48]. The bidirectional RNN encoder in the attentive encoder-decoder architecture analyzes the input sentence, and the RNN decoder with an attention mechanism generates the summary. The forward and backward contexts of the input sen-tence are both captured by the bidirectional RNN encoder, lead-ing to a more thorough grasp of the sentence structure. While generating each word in the summary, the model may dynam-ically focus on various portions of the input phrase because of the attention mechanism in the decoder. This selective focus al-lows the model to generate coherent and meaningful summaries. The Gigawaord dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in comparison to various baselines, such as the basic Seq2Seq model [8] and the attention-based model [48]. The results demonstrated that the attentive RNN-based encoder-decoder design generated more accurate and informa-tive abstractive summaries and outperformed the baselines.\nNallapati et al.

Copy Mechanism", "content": "Gu et al. [54] introduced copy mechanism, a novel approach for abstractive text summarization that addresses the challenge of handling rare and OOV words. OOV words, which are often included in real-world text data, make it difficult for conven-tional Seq2Seq models to generate accurate summaries. The authors provided a technique to address this problem that en-ables the neural network to selectively copy words from the input text straight into the generated summary. The copying mechanism was incorporated into the existing Seq2Seq frame-work, specifically into the attention mechanism. By removing the difficulties brought on by rare and OOV words, this method improves the model's capacity to generate more precise and coherent summaries. According to the experimental findings, adding a copy mechanism to Seq2Seq models considerably en-hances their ability to perform these tasks when compared to more conventional Seq2Seq models without a copy mechanism.\nFor abstractive text summarization, Song et al. [55] suggested a unique structure-infused copy mechanism that uses both syn-tactic and semantic information from the input text to help the copying process. The primary motivation behind this approach is to improve the coherence and accuracy of the generated sum-maries by leveraging the structural information inherent in the input text. The structure-infused copy mechanism incorporates semantic information such as named entities and key phrases along with a graph-based representation of the input text's syn-tactic structure, notably the dependency parse tree. The model can more accurately detect salient information and thus gener-ate summaries that more accurately capture the major concepts of the original text by including these structural features in the copying mechanism.

[57] proposed an enhancement to the Seq2Seq models by incorporating attention and pointers. This Pointer-Generator Network is useful for summarization tasks because it can either generate words from a preset vocabulary or copy them directly from the source, effectively handling rare or OOV words and leading to better abstractive summarization. Addi-tionally, a coverage mechanism is integrated to monitor attention history, ensuring diverse attention and reducing redundancy in the summaries. The model's effectiveness was evaluated on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset with notable improvements in ROUGE scores.\nSummaRuNNer, introduced by Nallapati et al. [58], uses Pointer Networks for abstractive tasks in addition to being de-signed for extractive summarization. It extracts the top-ranked sentences for the summary by evaluating the input documents at the word and sentence levels using a hierarchical RNN. By allowing direct copying from the source text in its abstractive variant, the pointer mechanism overcomes the limitations of conventional sequence-to-sequence models. The pointer mech-anism and RNN-based hierarchy work together to improve the model's summarization performance. The models were evalu-ated on the DUC 20023 dataset by using various variants of the Rouge metric and contrasted with cutting-edge models.\nKryscinski et al. [59] integrated Pointer Networks with re-inforcement learning for abstractive text summarization. Their model is trained using both supervised and reinforcement learn-ing, and it is based on the architecture of the Seq2Seq model with attention. The element of reinforcement guarantees con-formity with human preferences. In order to ensure accuracy and proper handling of OOV words, the Pointer Networks in-corporate straight copying from the input. Their approach per-formed better in terms of ROUGE scores when evaluated on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.\nChen et al. [60] combined reinforcement learning with Pointer Networks for abstractive summarization. Their model uses reinforcement learning to optimize the process of selecting and rewriting sentences from the input. Using the CNN/Daily Mail and DUC-2002 datasets, the model was assessed using METEOR [61], standard ROUGE metrics, and human evalua-tions of readability and relevance.\nUsing a unified model, Hsu et al.

In a variety of natural language processing tasks, including abstractive text summarization, these models achieve state of the art results. To provide a more comprehen-sive understanding of Pre-trained Large Language models in the context of abstractive text summarization, we have further di-vided them into four sub-classes based on their use, as shown in Figure 1: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), and BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers).

BERT", "content": "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-formers), introduced by Devlin et al. [10], is a pre-trained language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in var-ious natural language processing tasks. A key aspect of BERT's training process is the use of a Masked Language Model (MLM) objective. In this procedure, a predetermined portion of the sen-tence's input tokens is chosen to be masked or hidden from the model during training. Using the context that the other (non-masked words in the sentence) provide, the model is then trained to predict the original value of the masked words. BERT differs significantly from traditional unidirectional language models because it has a bidirectional understanding of context. BERT's strong contextual understanding and transfer learning capabili-ties give it a strong foundation for adapting to the abstractive text summarization task even though it was not designed specifically for it. In abstractive text summarization, BERT is used as an encoder to extract contextual information from the input text. The model is able to comprehend the intricate relationships be-tween words and their meanings, which is essential to generate summaries that are accurate and coherent. This is made achiev-able by pre-training bidirectional transformers using the MLM training regimen. Its ability to capture both local contexts and long-range dependencies gives BERT a benefit over traditional sequence-to-sequence models.\nRothe et al. [63] proposed a two-step strategy for abstractive text summarization by harnessing BERT's capacity to under-stand context-oriented details. Leveraging the contextual em-beddings of an already trained BERT, they applied extractive techniques on a large corpus, permitting the model to grasp the structure and semantics of the source text and successfully extract salient information. This initial extractive step resulted in summaries that were more accurate and coherent. The re-sults of this step are then fed into the abstractive summarization model, which centers around generating summaries that convey the main ideas while keeping up with text coherence. The ben-efits of extractive and abstractive summarization are integrated with this strategy, generating quality summaries with expanded comprehensibility and informativeness.\nDong et al. [64] presented a study on a unified language model, UniLM, for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Utilizing shared knowledge between the two types of tasks is made possible by this unified approach, potentially enhancing performance in a variety of applications. Similar to BERT, UniLM is pre-trained using a variety of training objectives and is based on the trans-former architecture. These objectives include masked language modeling (as in BERT), unidirectional (left-to-right or right-to-left) language modeling, and a novel Seq2Seq language mod-eling objective. UniLM can learn to comprehend and generate text by combining these objectives, making it suitable for NLU and NLG tasks. The CNN/Daily Mail dataset was one of the benchmark datasets used by the authors to evaluate UniLM for abstractive text summarization tasks. The experiment's findings demonstrated that the unified pre-training method significantly boosts performance when compared to other cutting-edge ap-proaches.\nSong et al. [65] presented the Masked Sequence to Sequence Pre-training (MASS) method, a useful technique to enhance the ability of models to generate abstractive summaries. The MASS technique, which is based on the BERT architecture, employs the masked language model objective, which allows the model to learn contextual information from both input and output se-quences. The authors developed the MASS approach primarily for tasks that required language generation, like abstractive sum-marization. By pre-training the model with the masked Seq2Seq"}, {"title": "3.2.2.

Specifically, it predicts the next word in a sequence given all previous words. Based on the transformer architecture, GPT and its successor, GPT-2, use unsupervised learning with a generative pre-training phase and fine-tuning on particular tasks. GPT-3, released in 2020, further scaled up the GPT approach to achieve strong performance on natural language tasks [68]. OpenAI released GPT-3.55 in 2022 by increasing the model size and training it on a larger dataset. Most recently, OpenAI released GPT-46 in 2023, which is a significant improvement as compared to GPT-3.5 and also considers safety and ethics. Although the GPT models have shown excellent potential in a number of nat-ural language processing tasks, including summarization, these works do not specifically focus on abstractive text summariza-tion. Researchers have improved GPT models for abstractive text summarization tasks by employing the use of their genera-tive nature, demonstrating their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant summaries.\nZhu et al. [69] fine-tuned GPT-2 for abstractive text summa-rization in Chinese, a language that had not been extensively studied in relation to GPT-2's performance. They used a dataset of Chinese news articles and their summaries, leveraging the self-attention mechanisms and token-based representations of the transformer architecture to modify the GPT-2 model. Its per-formance was compared to baseline models, including Seq2Seq and Pointer-Generator Networks on a Chinese news summariza-tion task. The authors found that the improved GPT-2 model surpassed the baselines in terms of ROUGE scores.

This corruption is introduced through strategies like token mask-ing, token deletion, and text shuffling. Unlike T5, which views every NLP task as a text-to-text problem and pre-trains with a \"fill-in-the-blank\" task, BART adopts a denoising objective, aiming to restore corrupted text. This approach equips BART to handle tasks that demand understanding and reconstructing sentence structures. After this pre-training phase, BART can be fine-tuned on task-specific datasets, demonstrating its prowess in domains like abstractive text summarization.

The main contribution was an alternating training strategy to jointly train the actor and critic models. The actor generated summaries using the attention-based Seq2Seq network, and the critic as-sessed their quality using Critic I (MLE) and Critic II (a global summary quality estimator).

The model employed an intra-attention mechanism to avoid redundancy and utilized a hybrid learning objective combining maximum likelihood loss with RL. The model additionally included a softmax layer for token generation or a pointer mechanism to copy rare or unseen input sequence words. The approach optimized the model for the ROUGE scores without compromising clarity and showed cutting-edge results on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, improving summary readability. The paper also highlights the limitations of relying solely on ROUGE scores for evaluation.\nChen et al.

Multiple working agents, each responsible for a subsection of the input text, col-laborate to complete the encoding operation. For the purpose of generating a targeted and comprehensive summary, these encoders are coupled with a single decoder that has been end-to-end trained using RL. In comparison to a single encoder or multiple non-communicating encoders, the results showed that multiple communicating encoders generate summaries of higher quality. Maximum likelihood (MLE), semantic cohe-sion, and RL loss were optimized during the training. Inter-mediate rewards, based on differential ROUGE measures, were incorporated to encourage unique sentence creation. Experi-ments conducted on the CNN/DailyMail and New York Times (NYT) [102] datasets showed better ROUGE scores compared to baseline MLE data. Human evaluations favored the summaries generated by deep communicating agents.\nHyun et al. [96] introduced an unsupervised method for generating abstractive text summaries of varying lengths us-ing RL. Their approach, Multi-Summary based Reinforcement Learning with Pre-training (MSRP), tackled the issue of gen-erating summaries of arbitrary lengths while ensuring content"}, {"title": "3.3.2.

With the availability of extensive, high-quality data, computational methods\nhave become a significant asset. Protein Interaction Network (PIN) is valuable\nbut challenging to implement due to its high dimensionality and sparsity. Pre-\nvious methods relied on indirect integration, leading to resolution loss. This\nstudy proposes GAN-TAT, a framework utilizing an advanced graph embed-\nding technology, ImGAGN, to directly integrate PIN for druggable gene infer-\nence work. Tested on three Pharos datasets, GAN-TAT achieved the highest\nAUC-ROC score of 0.951 on Tclin. Further evaluation shows that GAN-TAT'S\npredictions are supported by clinical evidence, highlighting its potential practi-\ncal applications in pharmacogenomics.

Despite significant efforts, many challenges persist [5]. Therefore, there is a critical need\nfor a systematic and innovative approach to thoroughly investigate and identify these genes, which is\nessential for advancing pharmaceutical research [11].\nThe growing availability of extensive multi-omics and systems biology data has provided researchers\nwith unprecedented opportunities to identify druggable genes [30]. Artificial intelligence (AI) has\nbecome instrumental in this process due to its capacity to analyze multidimensional and large-scale\nbiomedical data [32, 40]. For instance, DrugMiner developed a druggability model using protein\nsequence features, while DrugnomeAI advanced this field by incorporating a heterogeneous set of\nfeatures, including druggability, generic, and disease-specific attributes, to train ensemble models\n[22, 29].\nProtein Interaction Network (PIN) offers a detailed and comprehensive view of protein interactions\nwithin biological systems, making them valuable for identifying potential targets [17, 31]. However,\nthe high dimensionality and vast scale of PINs pose significant challenges for direct computational"}, {"title": "2 Method & Materials", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 PIN", "content": "This study examined a curated set of 6,048 genes that are involved in the cell signaling process. The\nProtein Interaction Network (PIN) was constructed using signal transduction pathway data from\nSignaLink 3.0, comprising 6,048 nodes and 20,697 directed, unweighted edges [8]. Additionally, 20\nUniProt annotations corresponding to the proteins encoded by these genes were integrated as node\nattributes [1]."}, {"title": "2.2 Extended Feature Set", "content": "To enhance the performance of downstream classification, we created an extended feature set. Binary-\nencoded pathway interaction data for each gene was sourced from the Comparative Toxicogenomics\nDatabase (CTD) [10]. Similarly, chemical interaction data from the CTD was used to create binary\nfeatures representing the total interactions per gene for different interaction types [10]. Gene\nclassification data, including domains, families, and superfamilies from InterPro, were also converted\ninto binary features [20]. The Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIDB) provided data on the\nfrequency of gene interactions with various drug types [4]. Additionally, genomic attributes, such\nas expression levels and variants, were extracted from gnomAD [23]. Features exhibiting low\noccurrence frequencies were manually excluded. A Pearson correlation coefficient threshold of 0.85\nwas subsequently applied, ultimately yielding a refined feature set comprising 324 elements [34]."}, {"title": "2.3 Architecture", "content": "GAN-TAT comprises two primary components: an upstream embedding module and a downstream\nclassification module. The upstream module utilizes the ImGAGN-GraphSAGE model for network\nembedding, which is a supervised learning model independently trained and optimized using the\nPIN and a label set. After training, the model generates an 80-dimensional embedding for each gene.\nThese embeddings are then concatenated with the extended feature set to form a comprehensive\nfeature vector, which is subsequently used in the downstream classification module.\nIn the downstream module, a subsampling strategy is implemented to mitigate class imbalance. The\ncomplete dataset is partitioned into M folds. For each fold, 80% of the minority (positive) class data\npoints are randomly selected. Additionally, a subset of the majority (negative) class data points is"}, {"title": "2.4 ImGAGN-GraphSAGE", "content": "The ImGAGN model integrates a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework consisting of\nthree principal components: a graph generator, an encoder, and a discriminator [13, 28]. This\narchitecture effectively manages imbalanced and sparse networks, making it ideal for this study.\nThe generator creates synthetic nodes and edges to achieve a balanced positive-to-negative label\nratio of 1:1. After integrating the generated data, the encoder (typically a GNN), produces node\nembeddings. The discriminator differentiates between genuine and synthetic nodes and classifies\ntheir types based on these embeddings. The discriminator is trained for 20 epochs for each epoch of\ngenerator training. In this study, the generator comprises three fully connected layers with ReLU\nactivations, culminating in a Tanh function [12]. The encoder uses the GraphSAGE architecture,\nwith two SAGEConv layers separated by ReLU activations and dropout regularization [12, 16, 35]\n(Figure 1B). This encoder embeds the graph into an 80-dimensional latent space. The discriminator\nemploys a single SAGEConv layer for classification, concluding with a softmax function. The design\nis illustrated in Figure 1B."}, {"title": "3 Experiment", "content": "The efficacy of various GAN-TAT configurations and frameworks, based on different embedding\nalgorithms, was evaluated using three distinct label sets sourced from Pharos: Tclin genes, Tclin\ntargets for pancreatic intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm, and Tclin targets for acute myeloid\nleukemia[24]. The PIN and the extended feature set used are the same as described in Sections 2.1\nand 2.2.\nWe trained nine models using three different embedding algorithms: Node2Vec, LINE (Large-\nscale Information Network Embedding) [14, 36], and ImGAGN-GraphSAGE. Each embedding\nalgorithm was paired with three different classifiers: Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and\nXgBoost[33, 3, 6]. All models were trained on an Apple M3 Pro CPU. Hyperparameters tuning\nfor the ImGAGN-GraphSAGE model was done manually. Node2Vec and LINE were paired with\nthe XgBoost classifier for evaluation. Both these embeddings and all classifiers were tuned using\ngrid search with 5-fold cross-validation and evaluated using the mean AUC-ROC score [27, 15].\nFurther details on hyperparameters and training are available in the GitHub repository. Results are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nTo further assess GAN-TAT's applicability, we grouped genes by their probability percentiles as\nassigned by the model and mapped them to Tclin genes to calculate overlaps (Figure 2A). A Fisher's\nexact test was performed on these overlaps. Additionally, we compared pathway enrichment scores\nof the top 5% predicted genes for GO:BP pathways against those of Tclin genes (Figure 2B) [18]. A\n15-point moving average is applied to reduce noise [21]."}, {"title": "4 Result", "content": "Our observations indicate that models based on the ImGAGN-GraphSAGE framework consistently\noutperform those utilizing other embedding algorithms, particularly in label sets characterized by\nhigher imbalance. Among the classifiers evaluated, XgBoost emerged as the most effective across all\nembedding methods. The data shows that the GAN-TAT configuration used in this study (ImGAGN-\nGraphSAGE + XgBoost) stands out as the most superior, with high AUC-ROC scores of 0.951, 0.919,\nand 0.925 across the datasets for Tclin, pancreatic neoplasm, and leukemia respectively (Table 1).\nFisher's exact test indicated extreme enrichment of Tclin genes in the top 5% interval with a p-value <\n2.4 \u00d7 10-266, and significant enrichment in the 5 \u2013 10% interval with a p-value < 1.5 \u00d7 10-17 [25].\nThe pathway enrichment analysis revealed that GAN-TAT's top 5% predictions closely align with\nTclin genes, as indicated by the two nearly overlapping lines in Figure 2B. These results suggested\nthat genes predicted by GAN-TAT are supported by clinical evidence."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This study introduces GAN-TAT, a novel machine-learning framework that leverages network embed-\nding for identifying druggable genes.

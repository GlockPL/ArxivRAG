{"title": "A Voter-Based Stochastic Rejection-Method Framework for\nAsymptotically Safe Language Model Outputs", "authors": ["Jake R. Watts", "Joel Sokol"], "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for preventing unsafe or otherwise low quality large language\nmodel (LLM) outputs by leveraging the stochasticity of LLMs. We propose a system whereby LLM\ncheckers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is\nreached, until sufficient checkers approve. We further propose estimators for cost and failure rate, and\nbased on those estimators and experimental data tailored to the application, we propose an algorithm that\nachieves a desired failure rate at the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure\nrate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and threshold are chosen according to\nthe algorithm, and that the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action,\neven with limited data.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Despite the power and utility of large language models (LLMs), hallucinations and other mistakes\nremain a major concern. LLMs can effectively deceive (Hagendorff, 2024), give incorrect or incomplete\nmedical advice (Drake, 2023), hallucinate false information (Ji et al., 2023), be jailbroken and deceived\n(Yong et al., 2023), and fail to follow important instructions, especially when users aim to trick them (as\nwe show later. See also (Richard, 2023)). Even at this early stage, the consequences of these errors can be\nsubstantial; legal liability may exist when models defame people, create malware, encourage self-harm,\ncause wrongful death, or assist in criminal activity (Lemley et al., 2023). In February of 2024, a Civil\nResolution Tribunal in British Columbia ruled that Air Canada was liable for a discount its chat bot had\nmistakenly promised a customer in a misinterpretation of Air Canada's policy for the discount (Yagoda,\n2024). As language models take on more important roles going forward, preventing such mistakes will\nbecome increasingly important.\nOne solution is simply to improve the models, by providing them more training data and more\nparameters. This is certainly leading to improvements, but it comes with its own drawbacks. Leading\nmodels like GPT-4 are already far too large to be run on household computers, and have been trained on\ntrillions of words. In 2023, it is estimated that OpenAI used over half a Gigawatt-hour per day just on the\nGPU servers running ChatGPT (Vries, 2023), and companies like Microsoft are looking into producing\ntheir own electricity just to be able to power new AI (Aylmer, 2024). We propose that our method of\nusing LLMs to preemptively catch their own mistakes provides a cost efficient and effective alternative or\nsupplementary approach to improving output and preventing dangerous errors or misalignment.\nSeveral approaches already exist for using LLMs to catch their own errors. Tree of thought\nprompting (Long, 2023) uses a specific structure building upon chain of thought prompting methods\nwhich aim to invoke reasoning in LLMs. Other methods are more obviously analogous to social systems.\nLLMs are sometimes used to simulate social behavior (Leng & Yuan, 2023) and AutoGen (Wu et al.,\n2023) and ChatEval (Chan et al., 2023) use multi-agent debate/conversation to improve performance"}, {"title": "Model", "content": "For this experiment, we imagine a customer service bot given an administrative passcode that it is\ntold not to reveal to customers. Testing revealed one particular attack prompt that was able to get GPT-\n3.5-turbo-1106 to reveal the password 20 times out of 100. We test the following approach to improve the\nsecurity of that chat bot.\nAfter the chat bot generator proposes a response to the attack prompt, n (LLM) checkers each\nindependently judge whether the generated output was acceptable. Each checker is fed the attack and then\nthe generator's response to the attack before reasoning out loud about its acceptability. The checker's\nanswer alone is then fed to an (also LLM) evaluator which parses it into a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (meaning\napproved or disapproved respectively). If k or more disapprovals are detected, the generator proposes a\nnew response and the process repeats. All prompts used are in the Appendix. In our testing, all LLM\ninstances are of the same or similar level of complexity, GPT-3.5-turbo models, as this task is of an\nappropriate level of difficulty for that generation of LLM. This approach provides a way to improve\noutput safety/quality without increasing complexity of the chat bot's neural network, potentially allowing\nsimpler LLMs capable of running on a single PC to outperform more complex LLMs at specific tasks.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a successful proof of concept as well as addressing the question of\noptimal choice of n and k under the tradeoff between cost and failure rate. We demonstrate two empirical\nestimates used to determine this choice and evaluate the model's cost-scaling; one systemically\nunderestimates cost and failure rate but requires less data to estimate, and another more unbiased\nestimator that requires more testing."}, {"title": "Estimator 1", "content": "The first estimator looks only at the difference in approval between good and bad responses, and\nestimates that a failure rate of approximately 0.2% can be reached at just 7.7 times the cost of generating\nan output without checking, and one-in-a-trillion at only 41 times the cost of the standard zero-checker\nsystem.\nWe call the rate of bad responses b, and the approval rates of good and bad responses $a_g$ and $a_b$\nrespectively, and we estimate the ratio of the cost of running a single check to the cost of generating a\nsingle response, which we refer to as the cost ratio $c_r$. Then, the probabilities of a given good or bad\ngenerated response being successfully output, respectively, are $p_g(n,k) = 1 - \\sum_{i=k}^{n} (\\binom{n}{i}) a_g^i (1-a_g)^{n-i}$\nor $p_b(n,k) = 1 - \\sum_{i=k}^{n} (\\binom{n}{i}) a_b^i (1-a_b)^{n-i}$. The failure rate of the system, the fraction of checker-\napproved outputs which are bad, is then $\\frac{bp_b(n,k)}{bp_b(n,k)+(1-b)p_g(n,k)}$, while the average cost per output (as a\nmultiple of the cost of generating a single proposed response) is $\\frac{1+nc_r}{1-(bp_b(n,k)+(1-b)p_g(n,k))}$. The failure rate\nof such a system is an improvement on a chat bot with no checkers as long as the checker is at least\nslightly more likely to approve of good outputs than bad.\nThis estimator requires relatively few parameters and can be computed relatively easily, but it\ntends to be biased towards predicting lower error rates and slightly higher costs, largely because some bad\nresponses will have higher approval rates than others and these will be more likely at high n and low k to\nbe output by the system (which this estimator doesn't account for).\nWe estimated b, ag, ap, and cr by generating 50 responses, 11 of which revealed the password in\nsome way, (so $b = 0.22 \u00b1 0.06$) then each response was checked by 50 checkers. Checkers approved of\nbad prompts 101 times, giving $a_b = 0.184 \u00b1 0.017$, and approved of good prompts 1858 times, giving\n$a_g = 0.9528 \u00b1 0.0048$. Calculations from token counts obtained in separate trials give $c_r = 1.41$,\nmeaning checking a response and evaluating the check costs about 41% more (based on current pricing\nfor GPT-3.5-turbo-0125) than generating it to begin with in this case.\nGiven these parameters, we used a simple enumeration algorithm to determine the values of n\nand k that achieve a given maximum failure rate at the lowest cost. We call these tuples of n and k\ndominating as there is no other combination that is simultaneously less expensive on average and has a\nlower failure rate.\nFigure 1 shows the log failure rate/cost curve for this first estimator. We observe a clear linear\ntrend when plotting log (base 10) failure rate, with slope 0.654, meaning that failure rate decreases by a\nfactor of 10 every time cost increases by 3.52 (multiples of the cost of having no checkers). According to\nthis estimator, using the parameters from our 22% baseline failure rate, the failure rate can be brought as\nlow as one-in-one-trillion at only 41 times the cost of having no checkers."}, {"title": "Estimator 2", "content": "A more conservative estimator for determining cost and failure rate takes into account that some\nbad responses might be much more likely than others to be approved by the checkers and thus be\noverrepresented in the outputs and produce higher error rates. To take this into account, we use a sample\nof representative generated responses, some good and some bad, each with its own approval rate and each\nequally likely to be generated. Checkers then either accept or reject each output based on its approval rate.\nFor this estimator, we used the same 50 generated outputs with 50 independent checks each, and\nestimated the approval rate of each representative generated response. For each response j, let $a_j$ be its\napproval rate and let $b_j = 1$ if the response is bad, and $b_j = 0$ otherwise. Let $p_j(n, k)$ be the probability\nof response i being output (surviving the checkers) when generated.\nThe overall failure rate of the system is computed by $\\frac{\\sum_{j=0}^{M}b_jp_j(n,k)}{\\sum_{j=0}^{M} p_j(n,k)}$, with cost in the same units as\nbefore equal to $\\frac{1+nc_r}{\\sum_{j=0}^{M} p_j(n,k)}$. Using a similar algorithm as the first estimator, we obtain the dominating\ntuples which best manage the tradeoff between cost and failure rate.\nAside from the first three dominating tuples at low cost, Figure 2 shows a similar log-linear\nrelationship to the first estimator, with failure rate decreasing by a factor of 10 every time cost increases\nby 13.4. Based on this, a failure rate of one-in-one-trillion is achievable at a cost of only around 160\ntimes the cost of no checkers, compared to the base 0.22 failure rate (for the 50 trials used to estimate this\ndata)."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "To assess the validity of these two failure-rate and cost estimators, we ran an experiment. We set\nup the proposed system, using GPT-3.5-turbo-1106 to generate prompts (consistent with the data used to\nderive estimator parameters) and GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 for the checkers and evaluators, with the same\nprompts each was given when collecting data for the failure rate estimators. We chose n = 6, k = 4, as\nthis gave predicted error rates large enough that 1000 trials would be able to detect errors (though this\ntuple is dominated by better choices). This was run until 1000 responses were approved. In total 1137\nresponses were generated, with 137 rejected, only one of which was rejected wrongly. Of the 1000\naccepted, 32 outputs were unsafe, giving a failure rate of 3.2%. This is compared to the 2.2% predicted by\nthe first estimator, and 4.2% in the second."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Both estimators produce a linear relationship between the log of the rate at which bad responses\nare output and the average cost of producing an output, when dominating n and k are chosen. When\ntested, the models performed reasonably well at predicting the failure rate and cost of the system despite\nbeing based on relatively limited data, particularly the second model. This indicates that, when n and k\nare chosen effectively according to our estimators (we suggest the second one be used when enough test\ndata can be obtained), this approach may be extremely effective in high-stakes AI safety scenarios.\nThis log-linear relationship is powerful, as it allows our approach to achieve very low failure rates\nwithout a proportional increase in cost. In cases where the checkers are very poor at discerning between\ngood and bad prompts (the acceptance rates of each are similar on average), the cost increase to reduce\nfailure rate by a factor of 10 can be large. However, it is likely that for any application where checkers\nperform reasonably well and good prompts are not exceptionally rare, the scaling will be reasonable,\nallowing simple LLMs to perform tasks extremely accurately.\nPerhaps most importantly, the behavior of the system depends much more heavily on the\nbehavior of the checkers than on the behavior of the generators. It does not require that the checker be\nperfect or even near-perfect either, only that it have an element of randomness so that all checkers do not\nalways agree. This greater relative dependence on checker performance compared to the generator is\nparticularly powerful for any application where it is much easier to detect bad outputs than it is to produce\ngood outputs. Since many engineering and design problems fall into this category, this approach may\nhave considerable application, particularly when the possibility of fine-tuning a discriminator to act as the\ncheckers opens up."}, {"title": "Appendix: Prompts", "content": "Generator:\n[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a chat bot working for laborCorp.

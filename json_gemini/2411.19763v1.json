This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages technical indicators and deep neural networks. The proposed architecture consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and attention mechanism. Initially, trend and oscillation technical indicators are employed to extract statistical features from Forex currency pair data, providing insights into price trends, market volatility, relative price strength, and overbought and oversold conditions. Subsequently, the LSTM and CNN networks are utilized in parallel to predict future price movements, leveraging the strengths of both recurrent and convolutional architectures. The LSTM network captures long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the data, while the CNN network extracts local patterns. The outputs of the parallel LSTM and CNN networks are then fed into an attention mechanism, which learns to weigh the importance of each feature and temporal dependency, generating a context-aware representation of the input data. The attention-weighted output is then used to predict future price movements, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and temporal dependencies. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach on multiple Forex currency pairs, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting price behavior and outperforming benchmark models.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The foreign exchange (Forex) market, being the largest financial market globally, with a daily trading volume exceeding $5 trillion, presents a multitude of opportunities for traders and investors. This market facilitates the simultaneous trading of various countries' currencies against one another. In the Forex market, currency pairs are formed, which are then traded against each other [1]. The high liquidity and volatility of the Forex market make it an attractive platform for traders seeking to capitalize on exchange rate fluctuations. Furthermore, the market's operational hours, spanning across different time zones, enable traders to trade at any time. As a result, the Forex market has become a popular destination for individuals and institutions alike, seeking to diversify their investment portfolios and manage risk [2]. Therefore, accurate prediction of exchange rate movements is crucial for traders and investors to make informed investment decisions, minimize potential losses, and maximize returns. Effective forecasting enables market participants to stay ahead of market trends, adjust their strategies accordingly, and ultimately gain a competitive edge in the highly volatile Forex market [3]. Silicon Valley's technological innovations and venture capital have played a crucial role in strengthening global financial markets by fostering entrepreneurship, driving economic growth, and increasing access to capital for startups and small businesses [4]. [5] proposes an innovative approach to agricultural education utilizes immersive technologies, such as augmented reality and virtual reality, to gamify learning and create engaging, interactive experiences that enhance student knowledge and skills. The Grace Platform is a work-in-progress initiative that integrates gamified augmented reality and virtual reality to revolutionize agriculture education, aiming to enhance pedagogy and provide immersive, interactive learning experiences for students [6].\nTechnical indicators play a vital role in Forex trading, analysis, and prediction, as they provide valuable insights into market trends, patterns, and sentiment, enabling traders to make more informed investment decisions. For example, Moving Averages (MA), such as the 50-day and 200-day averages, help traders identify trends and predict potential reversals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and is popular indicator used to detect overbought and oversold conditions, allowing traders to adjust their strategies accordingly. Bollinger Bands, which consist of a moving average and two standard deviations, provide a visual representation of volatility and can be used to identify potential breakouts and trend changes [7]. These technical indicators effectively operate as a feature extractor, distilling the complexities of the market into a set of meaningful and relevant features. These extracted features can then be leveraged by predictive models to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that might otherwise remain hidden in Forex price data [8].\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting time series data. By leveraging their ability to learn long-term dependencies and patterns in sequential data, LSTMs can effectively capture the complex dynamics underlying time series data [9]. Unlike traditional RNNS,"}, {"title": "II. CURRENCY MARKET FORECASTING", "content": "This section highlights the one-hour time frame as a popular choice among forex traders and explores key currency pairs commonly used in this timeframe. Also, the section reviews recent studies on applying deep learning techniques, such as CNNS, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms, to improve forex predictions and highlights their strengths, limitations, and potential to revolutionize forex market analysis and prediction [17].\n### A. Forex Dataset\nThe one-hour time frame offers a unique perspective on market dynamics, allowing traders and analysts to capture short-term fluctuations and trends in currency prices. With a one-hour time frame, market participants can identify and respond to rapid changes in market sentiment, news-driven events, and technical indicators, making it an ideal time frame for intraday trading and scalping strategies [3]. By focusing on this shorter time frame, traders can capitalize on fleeting opportunities and minimize exposure to overnight risks, making it an attractive option for those seeking to maximize returns in a fast-paced and volatile market environment.\nThe three major currency pairs, CHFUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD, are widely traded and closely watched in the foreign exchange market. With a one-hour time frame, these currency pairs offer a unique opportunity to analyze and forecast short-term price movements. The CHFUSD pair, representing the Swiss franc against the US dollar, is known for its stability and low volatility. The EURUSD pair, representing the euro against the US dollar, is one of the most liquid and widely traded currency pairs in the world. The GBPUSD pair, representing the British pound against the US dollar, is heavily influenced by economic indicators and geopolitical events [18]. By examining these three currency pairs with a one-hour time frame, traders and analysts can gain valuable insights into market trends and make informed trading decisions.\n### B. Literature Survey\nThe application of CNN in Forex prediction has shown promising results in identifying patterns and trends in currency exchange rates, enabling more accurate and informed trading decisions. [19] proposes a CNN approach to predict forex trends, leveraging the strengths of CNNs in image processing to analyze and forecast currency market patterns. [20] proposes a novel"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The third section of the paper is divided into two primary components. The first part focuses on the preprocessing of technical indicators, while the second part provides a detailed explanation of the proposed hybrid model, which is specifically designed for time series forecasting of forex currencies.\n### A. Technical Indicator\nTechnical indicators are widely used in finance to analyze and predict market trends. These indicators can be leveraged as feature extractors in machine learning and deep learning models to provide valuable insights into market behavior. In this context, technical indicators can be seen as a way to transform raw market data into meaningful features that can be used to train predictive models. The formula for a Simple Moving Average is:\n$SMA = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i$ (1)\nwhere $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i$ is the sum of the closing prices of the last n periods. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) calculates the ratio of average gains to average losses over a certain period of time to identify when an instrument is overbought or oversold. The formula is:\n$RSI = 100 - \\frac{100}{(1 + RS)}$ (2)\nwhere RS is the average gain divided by the average loss, both calculated over a specified number of periods. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator consisting of a central band accompanied by two outer bands.\nUpper - Lower Band = SMA(n) + k \u00d7 std(n) (3)\nMiddle Band = SMA(n) (4)\nThis configuration enables the bands to adapt to changes in volatility, thereby facilitating the identification of overbought and oversold market conditions.\n### B. Hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention Model\nThe proposed model is a sequential neural network designed specifically for predicting time series data. It's composed of multiple interconnected layers that work together to identify meaningful patterns in sequential data. The first layer, which is shaped to match the input time series, serves as the input layer. The LSTM layer, a key component of the model, can be mathematically represented by a set of equations.\n$f_t = \u03c3(W_f. [h_{t\u22121},x_t] + b_f)$ (5)\n$\\tilde{C}_t = tanh(W_c. [h_{t\u22121}, x_t] + b_c)$ (6)\n$i_t = \u03c3(W_i. [h_{t\u22121}, x_t] + b_i)$ (7)\n$C_t = f_t \u00d7 C_{t-1} + i_t * \\tilde{C}_t$ (8)\n$O_t = \u03c3(W_o. [h_{t\u22121}, x_t] + b_o)$ (9)\n$h_t = o_t \u00d7 tanh(C_t)$ (10)\nThe LSTM layer is defined by three gates: the forget gate ($f_t$), input gate ($i_t$), and output gate ($o_t$). These gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell state ($C_t$) and hidden state ($h_t$). The input at time step t is denoted as $x_t$. The sigmoid"}, {"title": "IV. SIMULATION RESULTS", "content": "The three major currency pairs are CHFUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD, with a one-hour time frame.

In this section, we conduct an empirical investigation of"}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that combines technical indicators with parallel LSTM and CNN networks and an attention mechanism, achieving improved accuracy in predicting Forex price behavior. The proposed method extracts statistical features from Forex currency pair data using trend and oscillation technical indicators, leverages a parallel CNN-LSTM architecture to predict future price movements, and utilizes an attention mechanism to generate a context-aware representation of the input data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting price behavior and outperforming benchmark models across three major currency pairs, CHFUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD. The superior performance of the CNN1D-LSTM-Attention model is evident from the plots, which show a closer fit to the actual exchange rates. The attention mechanism is effective in capturing complex patterns in the exchange rate data, and the recurrent structure of the LSTM model is more suitable for modeling temporal dependencies. Overall, the proposed method offers a promising approach for Forex price prediction and has the potential to be applied in real-world trading and investment scenarios.\nFuture work directions include exploring the application of the proposed hybrid approach to other financial markets, such as stocks and commodities, to further validate its generalizability and effectiveness. Additionally, incorporating other types of data, such as news articles, social media sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators, into the model could provide a more comprehensive view of the market and potentially improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, experimenting with different attention mechanisms and neural network architectures could lead to further performance enhancements. Finally, developing a real-time trading system that integrates the proposed model with risk management and portfolio optimization techniques could enable the creation of a fully automated trading platform."}]}

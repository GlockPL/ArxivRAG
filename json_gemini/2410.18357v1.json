Creativity and novel ideas are the driving forces behind innovation [1] and, as such, are central to economic growth. [2], [3] Therefore, the impact of AI on these domains is of particular interest. Recent studies underscore the creativity exhibited by GenAI, demonstrating higher continuity, flexibility, and originality in idea generation compared to human participants [4]. Research clearly indicates that GenAI can significantly enhance the quality of idea generation [5]. GenAI, particularly using Large Language Models (LLMs), has therefore the potential to profoundly transform innovation management, impacting every phase of the innovation process [6], [7], [8], [9]. Given recent advancements, GenAI may hold the greatest potential in the ideation phase of the innovation process [10] The collaboration between human and artificial intelligence is increasingly recognized as a critical element in enhancing decision-making and creativity within organizations [11], [12], [13], [14] Creativity Support Systems (CSS) have been developed to improve the flow of ideas, novelty, and diversity of individually generated concepts, which are inherently constrained by the user's personal knowledge. These tools allow users to explore a broader spectrum of creative possibilities, facilitating the development of ideas that might not have emerged through intuition alone [15]. The integration of GenAI, particularly LLMs, has the potential to make these systems even more effective.\nDespite the burgeoning interest and research in GenAI, the integration of AI tools into human-centric innovation processes, particularly in team-based settings, remains underexplored. Recent studies, such as the comparative analysis of human-generated and ChatGPT-generated ideas, have focused on evaluating AI-generated ideas in isolation [5]. However, the specific impact of AI-supported idea generation on team dynamics and the quality, speed, and diversity of ideas generated collaboratively by humans with Al assistance has not been adequately addressed. This gap in the literature presents a significant opportunity to explore the potential synergies between AI and human creativity. Specifically, there is a need to understand how AI-augmented ideation tools influence the overall ideation outcome in collaborative settings. Do AI-supported tools enhance the quality and efficiency of ideas generated by human teams? Can these tools accelerate the ideation process and increase the diversity of ideas produced? These questions are critical as organizations increasingly look to leverage AI to boost their innovation capabilities. The current study aims to rigorously investigate the effects of AI-supported idea generation on team-based innovation, focusing on the quality, speed, and diversity of ideas."}, {"title": "2 Creativity and the dynamics of Innovation", "content": "Creativity is a complex socio-psychological phenomenon that drives innovation through the generation of novel and useful ideas [21], [22], [23]. The creative process encompasses problem identification, idea generation, and implementation [24]. Imagination seems to play an important role in fostering creativity - a concept emphasized by Einstein's (1929) statement 'Imagination is more important than knowledge' [25] and supported by various creativity theories [26], [27], [28], [29]. Creativity can be defined as a process that arises from a perception of the environment that recognizes a certain imbalance and leads to a productive activity that challenges patterned thought processes and norms and produces something new in the form of a physical object or even a mental or emotional construct [30]. Creativity emerges from the interplay between reproduction (knowledge and past experiences) and projection (imagination), triggered by perceived discrepancies in one's environment [31]. The transition from creativity to innovation involves a spectrum of contributions, ranging from replication to integration [32] while balancing originality and practicality [33]. Cropley (2006) describes creativity as the engine of innovation [1], [34]. The Componential Model of Creativity and Innovation emphasizes the interplay of individual and organizational factors in the innovation process [35]. Idea generation is a key process in organizational innovation, where cognitive flexibility is crucial for the development and refinement of different thought elements into actionable concepts [36], [37], [38]. Creativity involves combinatorial and exploratory approaches that require a comprehensive knowledge base and the ability to manipulate existing knowledge to develop meaningful and valuable ideas [39], [40]. In the field of"}, {"title": "2.2 Dynamics of Innovation", "content": "When exploring the intersection of entrepreneurship, economic growth, and technology, foundational theories provide valuable insights. The Solow model demonstrates technological progress as main driver for economic growth [55], Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction emphasizes the essential role of innovation and entrepreneurship in fostering long-term economic development and reallocating resources [56]. Expanding on these ideas, Romer's endogenous growth model identifies knowledge and human capital as key drivers of sustained economic growth, laying the groundwork for the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepreneurship (KSTE) [57].\nKSTE proposes that the spillover of knowledge, particularly in entrepreneurial contexts, is crucial for economic advancement [58]. The theory suggests that not all newly created knowledge is commercialized, creating entrepreneurial opportunities [16], [17] as uncommercialized knowledge spills over to economic actors, influencing resource allocation[16]. Much like the advent of the internet, it seems that recent advances in the AI technology trend, particularly GenAI, could significantly enhance societal growth by making knowledge more accessible to individuals and organizations [59], [60], [61]. GenAI, especially in the form of LLMs, could provide direct access to rich and diverse information, revolutionizing the way entrepreneurs and researchers interact and apply knowledge. The novelty of recent advances in the field of AI means that its role in knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurial innovation is still underexplored and requires further research."}, {"title": "3 Generative Artificial Intelligence and Innovation", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 GenAls role within the innovation process model", "content": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved from basic text retrieval to becoming integral to human-computer interaction [83], [84]. Transformer-based models, especially those utilizing self-attention mechanisms [85], have significantly advanced text processing, sparking interest in their application within innovation [84], [86], [87]. Studies highlight GPT-4's potential in creative tasks, emphasizing Al's growing role in routine and complex problem-solving [4], aligning with the early visions of AI pioneers [88]. Generative Al is now reshaping creativity across industries[89], [90], driving hybrid human-AI operating models and new roles in innovation management[91], [92], [93].\nAs companies adapt their innovation strategies to leverage this technological progress, generative AI is gaining attention for its potential to complement or even replace human tasks within organizational innovation processes [6], [10], [94]. High research and development investments do not always equate to significant innovations, as a company's ecosystem[95], [96], [97], access to knowledge [98], [99], and political support are crucial [100], [101], [102], [103]. The integration of GenAI into innovation processes is increasingly emphasized due to its potential to augment or replace human tasks [104], [105], particularly in information processing and decision-making within innovation management [106], [107]. Generative AI impacts each stage of the innovation process [108], [109], [110], [111] aiding in setting objectives, rationalizing data processing, and generating valuable insights [106], [107].

LLMs are therefore increasingly valuable for knowledge spillovers and entrepreneurial activities. While traditional knowledge extraction from unstructured data was labor-intensive[121], transformer models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have greatly improved efficiency, benefiting innovation teams [122], [123]."}, {"title": "3.3 Application of generative Al in ideation", "content": "Creativity at the individual level is rooted in the integration of primary resources such as knowledge, the competence for innovative synthesis of these resources, and intrinsic motivation as a driving force [31]. The ideation process is characterized by the application and synthesis of knowledge, stimulating cognitive processes [139], [140]. Creativity involves both combinatorial and exploratory approaches, requiring a broad knowledge base and the ability to manipulate this knowledge to generate valuable ideas [39], [40]. Inspiring stimuli are crucial in this process, leading to novel, unique, and practical solutions [43], [44], [45], [46]. The effectiveness of current LLMs is most evident in the ideation phase of the innovation process, where collaborative environments enhance knowledge spillover [71], [141]. GenAI can significantly boost creativity by overcoming human limitations in information processing and local search routines during idea generation [10]. GenAI's specific applications in problem exploration involve utilizing embedded knowledge within LLMs to identify innovation opportunities [142], a task previously limited by the difficulty of extracting knowledge from unstructured data [121]. In exploring solution spaces, GenAI models excel in ideation [143] and uncovering new technological possibilities [144], [145], significantly expanding both creative problem and solution spaces [145]. GenAI serves as a crucial catalyst for creativity in innovation, helping to overcome cognitive limitations and fostering an environment conducive to innovation. Creativity support systems (CSS), particularly those augmented by GenAI, are designed to enhance the knowledge flow, novelty, and diversity of ideas [15].

Refined through extensive UX research with fifteen participants across three usability studies, this tool was tailored to user needs, offering an intuitive, chat-like interface for a seamless collaborative experience. Study participants logged in with unique codes to ensure proper group assignment, anonymity, and secure data storage.\nWhen a team member posed a problem, the tool's advanced algorithm broke it down into components, converting them into detailed queries for the GPT-4 backend (Appendix 1). For each problem, the system generated four AI personas, each with specialized expertise, tailored to the problem at hand to maximize output quality. These personas engaged dynamically in brainstorming sessions, offering insights and feedback like human experts (Appendix 1). Teams could regenerate personas with refined problem descriptions in a separate tab, enabling a flexible brainstorming process.\nThe tool's backend architecture featured a database interface that recorded every user interaction, idea, and solution proposal in real-time, ensuring no loss of data and providing a complete record for analysis. For task management, the tool allowed teams to display, discuss, and input solutions directly within the interface, with solutions only saved once consensus was reached, promoting collaborative decision-making. Additionally, the tool employed an automated prompt sequencing system, continuously feeding the ongoing conversation transcript into the AI to prevent repetitive outputs and ensure each contribution was unique and contextually relevant.\nIn this experiment, a critical element of AI software development was controlling the model's 'temperature,' which dictates the level of randomness in Al responses. By setting the temperature to zero, we ensured deterministic outputs, enhancing the comparability of the teams' results. The tool combined advanced GenAI features with user-focused design and strong data management to enable an innovative approach to ideation while providing a controlled environment for comparing GenAI-supported and traditional brainstorming. Additionally, to ensure unbiased evaluation, ideas generated by both groups were anonymized and combined into a curated database, preventing any traceability to the original teams by the expert jury.\nThe methodology involved two groups of students from the University of Regensburg: an experimental group and a control group, each working in separate rooms.

Inductive analysis confirmed that the experimental group performed significantly better in overall idea generation, with notable improvements in originality, paradigm relevance, acceptance, and feasibility. The study also found that the experimental group was more likely to produce revolutionary innovations. This shows that AI augmented leads to ideas with a higher disruptive potential, although a more detailed examination is needed. A satisfaction survey revealed a 23.3% higher satisfaction rate in the experimental group, suggesting that AI integration can significantly boost participant satisfaction and engagement in the ideation process. Time measurements indicated clearly that the experimental group reached high-quality solutions more quickly, supporting hypotheses of improved knowledge spillover, accelerated ideation, and increased efficiency through GenAI.

One challenge is isolating Al's specific effects from other factors, such as team dynamics and individual creativity. Although participants were randomized into similar groups, pre-existing knowledge could have influenced outcomes, complicating the assessment of GenAI's true impact and the knowledge spillover facilitated by LLMs. The focus on explicit knowledge gained through GenAI may not fully capture the teams' nuanced understanding or application, particularly concerning implicit knowledge. The study's generalizability is also limited by the homogeneous participant pool, which may not reflect the diversity of real-world innovation teams across various industries. Furthermore, the study's emphasis on specific innovation tasks in healthcare and the automotive industry limits its broader applicability.\nThe potential cognitive load and information overload from Al tools were not thoroughly explored, despite their possible significant impact on ideation. Ethical considerations, such as AI-induced bias and intellectual property implications, were also underexamined. The lack of long-term observations to assess Al's lasting impact on ideation and team dynamics, along with the learning curve associated with new AI tools, further constrains the study's conclusions. Although the study analyzed the qualitative outputs of experimental and control groups, it does not fully explain the role of knowledge spillover from LLMs in the experimental group's superior performance, particularly given the subjective nature of idea evaluation. The use of a heuristic evaluation method according to Dean et al. (2006) and a diverse jury was noted, but the inherent subjectivity in assessing unrealized ideas remains a limitation."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "In this empirical study, the impact of AI on idea generation and the performance of innovation teams was analyzed. Participants, consisting of students, were divided into two groups: a control group, which engaged in ideation without AI support, and an experimental group that utilized a custom-developed AI-assisted ideation tool. Teams of three participants were tasked with solving two distinct problems. Upon completion, the ideas generated by both groups were evaluated by a panel of experts in academia, entrepreneurship, and innovation management. This panel assessed the ideas based on the dimensions of idea quality proposed by Dean et al. (2006) [20], without being informed of the group affiliations. Following this assessment, the ideas were categorized using Abernathy and Clark's (1985) innovation matrix [82].\nThe study's findings clearly demonstrate that teams utilizing AI support generated higher-quality ideas in a shorter amount of time. Across all dimensions of idea quality, except for applicability, the AI-assisted teams outperformed the control group.

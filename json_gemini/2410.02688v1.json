INTRODUCTION", "content": "Immersive communications (IC), envisioned to seamlessly bridge the physical and virtual worlds, have been recognized as a key use case of sixth-generation (6G) communication networks by IMT-2030 due to their vast potentials [1]. In education, entertainment, healthcare, and many other realms, IC can have an immense impact that profoundly changes our ways of living. The popularity of the Metaverse concept, as a manifestation, is propelling the development of a lifelike virtual world that provides users with a deep immersion in social interactions. Meanwhile, the commercialization of wear-able displays that can blend virtual content with the physical world is unlocking immersive three-dimensional (3D) video and audio experiences for more and more users. Considerable progress has also been made in transmitting haptic information over a communication link or network. Haptic devices such as gloves can enrich the communication experiences of users by supporting remote operations with haptic feedback. As a result, IC will enable people in different corners of the world to interact with each other and enjoy vivid visual, auditory, and haptic experiences as if they are inches apart.\nTo support multi-sensory immersive interactions among users worldwide, transcending networks beyond 5G in all performance metrics is essential [2]. Moreover, due to the human user-centric characteristics of IC applications, 6G net-works need to introduce new dimensions of capability to meet the unprecedented demands of individual users, including the following three aspects. First, in IC applications, even a slight body movement of a user, e.g., a gaze shift, may result in substantial network resource demand to maintain the sense of immersion. Due to the inherent uncertainty of user behaviors, networks must accurately characterize the impact of individual user behaviors on their network resource demands. Such char-acterization often relies on big data, thereby lacking scalability when managing detailed data from a massive number of users. Second, the prevailing quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) metrics, based on a fixed set of data at-tributes, cannot accurately reflect user satisfaction in IC. Since multi-sensory experience is susceptible to dynamic changes in the physical world, a fixed set of data attributes as the QoE metrics may not precisely reflect user satisfaction. Therefore, an adaptable set of QoE metrics, based on the dynamic ad-justment of data attributes, is essential for accurately reflecting user satisfaction in IC applications. Third, it is a consensus that artificial intelligence (AI) will be foundational for IC, both in network management and application development. Due to significant differences in user behavior patterns, concerns arise about whether AI models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), trained on aggregated data from many users can perform optimally for each individual user [3]. Thus, networks need to support the customization of AI models for IC users. Due to the aforementioned reasons, understanding user behaviors, meeting unique user demands, and thereby enabling user-centric service provision, are expected in 6G networks to support IC.\nIn this article, we advocate a new data-oriented approach for network resource management to achieve user-centric immersive communications (UCIC) in 6G. This approach emphasizes the process of providing granular network data through the introduction of personalized data management, in order to support network modeling customized for individ-ual users and enable user-centric service provision. Different from conventional approaches which emphasize the process of network modeling, the data-oriented approach focuses on enhancing both the quality and the quantity of network data for advanced network modeling, including integrated model-based and data-driven methods [4]. We leverage the digital twin (DT) technique as a key enabler of the data-oriented approach [5]."}, {"title": "II. USER-CENTRIC IMMERSIVE COMMUNICATIONS", "content": "In this section, we provide a brief introduction to immersive communications and share our vision of UCIC."}, {"title": "A. Overview of Immersive Communications", "content": "IC refer to communication and networking technologies that deliver lifelike experiences to users. Emerging IC applications include extended reality (XR), holographic communication, and haptic communication. We summarize features of IC applications as follows.\n\u2022 Multi-sensory: IC applications involve multi-sensory perception, including visual, auditory, and haptic, each corresponding to distinct sensations, e.g., temperature and pressure. User devices serve as interfaces to transmit and process the multi-sensory information involved in IC.\n\u2022 Multi-module: IC requires a synergy of technologies, e.g., device pose tracking and annotation rendering in the case of augmented reality. A dedicated module for each technology provides the corresponding functionality in enabling immersive interactions. These modules require network support in terms of communication, computing, sensing, and so on.\n\u2022 Human-in-the-loop: IC applications are inherently human-in-the-loop since they depend on continuous, real-time user interactions, where individual user behaviors directly influence other users' responses. This makes the user experience heavily dependent on human factors.\n\u2022 AI-native: IC in 6G will be tied to AI. Many mod-ules, such as device pose prediction, are AI-driven. Furthermore, 6G networks are envisioned to be AI-native, featuring intelligent resource management for delivering immersive experiences. For example, future 6G networks can leverage generative AI to create virtual content on user devices to reduce the communication load in content delivery."}, {"title": "B. Features of UCIC and Challenges", "content": "UCIC is expected to provide users with immersive experi-ences while accommodating the diverse characteristics of users in IC applications. The core concept is to enable personalized service provisioning for each individual user via network resource management, including key aspects as follows.\n\u2022 Adaptable user QoE: Since user satisfaction in IC applications is influenced by dynamic changes in factors such as user behaviors, UCIC should support continuous and automated adjustment of user QoE metrics based on the online analysis of user-related data. However, related research independent of domain-specific knowledge a priori remains in its early stages.\n\u2022 User-customized AI: Given the differences in user be-havior and user-perceived experience, UCIC should en-sure that the AI-based models perform optimally for individual users, rather than over a large set of users on average. However, effectively leveraging data resources within networks to guide the training, inference, and updating of AI-based models for each individual user remains a challenge.\n\u2022 Scalable user characterization: Characterizing user de-mands, e.g., quantifying the impact of user behaviors on resource demands, is indispensable for on-demand network resource management in UCIC. In practice, differences among users may not lead to substantial variations in resource demands. Moreover, conducting big data analysis for each individual user can yield significant data management overhead [6]. Identifying a proper set of users to characterize their unique demands in various network scenarios is essential yet challenging."}, {"title": "III. DATA-ORIENTED NETWORK RESOURCE MANAGEMENT", "content": "In this section, we introduce the concept and the scope of data-oriented network resource management for UCIC in 6G."}, {"title": "A. Concept of the Data-oriented Approach", "content": "The data-oriented concept originates from a field of AI, i.e., data-centric AI, which emphasizes data engineering for improving the performance of AI models [7]. Extending this concept from AI to the communication network field, we advocate the new data-oriented approach for network resource management to support UCIC.\nResearchers in the communication network field usually address network resource management problems by develop-ing advanced network models, initially mathematical models derived from observations. However, as networks become increasingly complex, large-scale, and heterogeneous, and service demands more diversified, developing accurate closed-form mathematical models becomes infeasible. With the ad-vent of AI, researchers can now extract information from massive network data using AI techniques, enabling network resource management decision making without relying on closed-form mathematical network models. In this context, AI can play the role of a network model in network resource management.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, we refer to the approach that emphasizes the development of mathematical or AI-based network models to effectively extract information from the given network data for optimizing network resource management as model-oriented network resource management. However, the model-oriented approach may struggle to address issues such as missing and biased data, and cannot provide an adequate set of network data in terms of data volume, granularity, diversity, and other factors. Therefore, we target a data-oriented network resource management approach that highlights systematic data management in order to improve the quality and quantity of network data for enhancing network modeling via mathemat-ical, AI-based, or hybrid methods [4]."}, {"title": "B. Scope of the Data-oriented Approach", "content": "The data-oriented approach can support UCIC in two as-pects: 1) Enhancing network data, which involves system-atically improving the data quality across all phases of net-work modeling; 2) Expanding network data, which involves introducing data life-cycle management to identify and utilize untapped data resources in existing network management. We elaborate on these two aspects via data operation tasks in three phases of network modeling, i.e., development, evaluation, and update phases. Each data operation task deals with a specific data-related issue."}, {"title": "1) Network Model Development Phase", "content": "Developing net-work models, e.g., a QoE model, is fundamental for optimizing network resource management. In this phase, data operation tasks can be designed to prepare high-quality data to facilitate the development of network models with comprehensive in-formation. For example, in IC, selecting an appropriate set of data attributes for identifying user QoE and defining the proper granularity of data samples can improve the accuracy of QoE-based resource demand prediction. Such data operation tasks can also be based on mathematical network models, which can provide a priori knowledge for efficient data management."}, {"title": "2) Network Model Evaluation Phase", "content": "Succeeding network model development, the evaluation phase quantitatively char-acterizes the performance of network resource management decisions based on the developed network models. In this phase, data operation tasks focus on enhancing data quantity by generating additional data samples with diverse features. For example, to evaluate whether a data traffic model devel-oped from aggregated data of multiple user devices meets the service demand of each individual user, data operation tasks in this phase should generate user-specific datasets to evaluate this user-agnostic model. These tasks support fine-grained evaluation of both closed-form mathematical network models and implicit AI-based network models from a data perspective, thereby guiding decision making for user-centric service provision."}, {"title": "3) Network Model Update Phase", "content": "Due to the continuous changes of network environments, user behaviors, and other factors, regularly refining the network models for network resource management is necessary. Accordingly, the data required for updating those models should be continuously collected. The data operation tasks in the update phase concen-trate on processing data for information extraction and timely triggering network model updates from a data perspective [8]. For example, by establishing quantitative measurements to characterize the impact of the input data samples used for decision making on network performance, new metrics can be introduced to trigger updates of AI models for resource management. Due to the consumption of network resources, such as data storage and computing power, resulting from continuous data operations, it is essential to balance between the overhead of data engineering and network performance gains."}, {"title": "IV. DIGITAL TWIN AS AN ENABLER", "content": "In this section, we present our approach to data-oriented net-work resource management by leveraging the DT technique."}, {"title": "A. Advantages of Digital Twins", "content": "For data-oriented network resource management, we adopt the DT technique as a key enabler for the following benefits.\n\u2022 Increase of available data attributes: From the data quantity perspective, the DT technique can enrich the data attributes available for optimizing network resource management by establishing digital replicas of network entities. For example, to comprehensively depict the user characteristics, DTs established for individual user devices should incorporate application-specific data at-tributes, such as users' multi-sensory QoE requirements and pose variation patterns, which have not been ade-quately leveraged in existing network resource manage-ment [9].\n\u2022 Customizable data updates: From the data quality perspective, the DT technique supports flexible updating mechanisms for different data attributes, since the real-time synchronization between DTs and their correspond-ing physical objects ensures the availability of high-quality data for updates, allowing for dynamic adjust-ments of data quality as needed. As a result, the DT technique can facilitate the network model adaptation by adjusting network data quality, such as feature dimension and granularity.\n\u2022 End-to-end evaluation capabilities: From the data man-agement perspective, the DT technique enables end-to-end evaluation of how data operations impact network performance or use satisfaction through network model-ing and network resource management decision making. This is because DTs can receive feedback from physical objects, such as reports from user devices on delay per-formance, which is influenced by both network resource management and data operations. As a result, the DT technique introduces the possibility of guiding the joint management of network data and network resources.\n\u2022 Data-model integration: The DT technique facilitates the integration of network data and models. Mathematical network models can be used to generate network data via emulating various network scenarios, while network data can be used to derive network models via extracting patterns. The DT technique can incorporate mathematical and AI-based methods in network resource management."}, {"title": "B. Conceptual Architecture", "content": "Toward user-centric service provision, our approach con-centrates on establishing user DTs for individual user devices and integrating user-related data management functionalities into network resource management. Building on our previous research [4], we present the conceptual architecture of our approach targeting systematic data management to achieve data-oriented network resource management in Fig. 2. The four primary components of the architecture are outlined into follows:\n\u2022 User Digital Twin (UDT): We propose establishing a digital replica, termed UDT, for each individual user device under consideration. Within a UDT, we define a personalized user profile that organizes a set of data attributes related to the corresponding user device for a target application. The data attributes are intended to efficiently structure data samples for providing network resource management with explicit or implicit informa-tion. We define a schema that describes the relations among data attributes, such as device ID, device type, and user's QoE requirements, while specifying a data structure for efficient organization [10]. For example, we show a reference user profile for an augmented reality device in Fig. 2, where data attributes are organized in a hierarchical manner to support radio spectrum resource management for timely device pose tracking [9]. To ensure the feasibility of the UDT, the schema defini-tion should involve constraints on data samples from a network perspective. A simple example is that the granularity of channel condition data should not exceed the granularity recorded by an access point.\n\u2022 Data Management Module (DMM): The DMM is responsible for executing various data operation tasks as mentioned in Subsection III-B. Specifically, within the DMM, we propose a set of UDT functions, each corresponding to a specific data operation task. Data exchange between different UDT functions is designed to support network-level data engineering while reducing redundant data operations. We classify UDT functions into three categories: I) functions contributing to the definition of schemas; II) functions enabling bidirectional synchronization between UDTs and user devices; and III) functions facilitating the development, evaluation, and updating of network models.\n\u2022 Bidirectional Synchronization (BiSync): The BiSync implements the synchronization between each user device and its corresponding UDT. From a user device to its UDT, there is a data flow starting from raw data collection at user devices, followed by data processing at the DMM, as indicated by the solid gray arrows in Fig. 2. In the other direction, the synchronization is not simply transmitting data from a UDT to its corresponding user. Instead, UDTs influence network modeling and the decision making of network resource management, which in turn affects user devices.\n\u2022 Network Management Interface (NMI): The NMI bridges data management and network resource manage-ment, with two primary functions. First, by utilizing the information from UDT functions in the DMM, the NMI is responsible for the development, evaluation, and updating of network models, such as closed-form Poisson models or inherent network models contained in well-trained DNNs. Second, based on the network models, the NMI offers comprehensive information for making network resource management decisions. These two functions may be integrated, particularly in AI-based approaches to network resource management where DNNs directly output the decisions.\nRather than simply collecting data, the essence of our data-oriented network resource management approach is developing a data model, which organizes data and effectively extracts information from the data [10], [11]. We refer to the process of customizing a data model for network resource management in a dynamic environment as network data modeling. In our approach, the schema for a UDT organizes the relationships among the associated data attributes, serving as a tool to capture the static characteristics of the corresponding user device. Meanwhile, UDT functions in the DMM define rules of analyzing time-varying data values, serving as tools to capture the dynamic characteristics of the user device. Since each UDT function can be mathematical, AI-based, or hybrid, the NMI can flexibly coordinate network data modeling with network resource management decision making, especially via emerging hybrid-model-data-driven methods."}, {"title": "C. Adaptive Network Data Modeling", "content": "Here, we discuss data life-cycle management for adapting the data model to network dynamics, thereby facilitating adaptive network resource management. We introduce the workflow according to the phases of development, evaluation, and update."}, {"title": "1) Development Phase", "content": "In this phase, UDT functions sup-port network model development from the schema definition and data operation perspectives. To ensure the UDTs contain comprehensive data attributes while avoiding high costs from large database administration such as data warehouse, we consider a two-tier database as shown in Fig. 3. UDT functions define the schema of a large database for low-redundancy data management across the entire network. Following this, they define the initial schemas of small databases for UDTs and enable UDTs to efficiently leverage the large database for ephemeral and customizable data management tailored to individual user devices. Since UDT functions determine the overall set of data attributes available for QoE modeling, they are crucial for user QoE satisfaction. Thus, we can introduce data mining, e.g., association rule learning or ablation study [12], into UDT functions to precisely identify users' specific QoE metrics and corresponding data attributes for QoE modeling.\nUDT functions concentrate on preparing high-quantity data to enhance the capture of information, thereby facilitating the development of network models, particularly for AI-based QoE modeling. For example, they support QoE modeling by uncovering latent relationships between allocated radio re-sources and the resulting device pose tracking errors in XR [9]. Typical data operation tasks for UDT functions in this phase are outlined in Table I. Data reduction enhances efficiency and accuracy in network model development by removing irrelevant or redundant data, while data augmentation improves the generalization capabilities of network models by enhancing data diversity."}, {"title": "2) Evaluation Phase", "content": "UDT functions in this phase mainly support the fine-grained evaluation of network model perfor-mance from two perspectives. First, by integrating mathemati-cal network models with network data, they can emulate atyp-ical network scenarios not captured during the development phase, thereby evaluating the robustness of a network model. Second, UDT functions can evaluate the performance of individual user devices under resource management decisions based on a general network model, e.g., a user-averaged data traffic model. Techniques such as generative AI or data slicing, which partition datasets involving multiple user devices into datasets specific to each user device [13], can be applied for this purpose. From these two aspects, UDT functions can exploit additional network data to increase the granularity of network model evaluation, thereby facilitating fine-tuned network resource management."}, {"title": "3) Update Phase", "content": "In this phase, UDT functions facilitate updating both network models and UDTs. Regarding network model updates, a conventional approach is to trigger reactive updates by continuously monitoring and analyzing network performance data, which can be viewed as a downstream analysis of network modeling. Using UDTs, one can update network models through proactive assessment of the quality of the data input into the network models, representing an upstream analysis. Specifically, new metrics including the data quality of a set of data samples, e.g., data distribution shifts, or the value of individual data samples, e.g., the Shapely value, can be employed to proactively initiate network model updates [14]. This can address certain issues related to network modeling at an early stage.\nSince UDT functions are centered on UDTs, the evolution of UDTs, specifically UDT schema update, becomes necessary to capture the changing properties of user devices using real-time data. To this end, the tasks of data collection, transformation, and analysis should be properly defined for UDT functions to ensure that the updated schema provides comprehensive information to update network models. Furthermore, it is crucial to strike a balance between the network performance gains and the resources consumed by UDT functions for updating the UDTs."}, {"title": "V. CASE STUDY", "content": "In this case study, we show the effectiveness of our UDT-based approach in supporting user-centric virtual content de-livery for the IC application of mobile augmented reality (MAR) [9], [15]."}, {"title": "A. Considered Scenario", "content": "In the considered scenario, MAR users within the coverage of an AP move freely with six degrees of freedom. An edge server deployed at the AP delivers volumetric videos as virtual content to MAR devices, allowing seamless integration with the real-world environment surrounding the MAR users. Each frame of a volumetric video is composed of a dense point cloud, posing a challenge in meeting the stringent latency requirement for MAR. A classic approach involves spatially segmenting the point cloud in each frame into multiple tiles and proactively delivering only the tiles that will likely fall within the field of view of an MAR user, according to the prediction of the MAR device pose. As the edge server needs to collect data related to device poses for pose prediction, the network should allocate sufficient uplink communication resources to ensure timely pose data collection. We use a public dataset that records the pose traces of 40 users watching a volumetric video"}, {"title": "B. Our Approach and Performance Evaluation", "content": "We conduct the case study in two parts, as follows.\n1) User QoE Modeling: To achieve satisfactory QoE, we establish UDTs to help build QoE models that map from net-work resource management decisions to corresponding MAR users' QoE. We adopt a hierarchical data structure for the user profile in each UDT. In addition to device category, user ID, and timestamps, the user profile incorporates two key data attributes for QoE modeling. First, the virtual content hit rate (VCHR) is used as a QoE metric, representing the ratio of overlapped point cloud between the delivered tiles and the rendered tiles, since it impacts user immersion in MAR [15]. Second, the pose data collection frequency is employed to represent a network resource management decision, assuming an identical uplink resource consumption for each pose data collection. Following this data structure, data samples are prepared for modeling the relation between the pose collection frequency and the user QoE, i.e., the VCHR. The third-order polynomial regression is used to develop a QoE model based on the data samples in each UDT."}, {"title": "2) MAR User Selection for UDT Establishment", "content": "While establishing a UDT benefits user-specific QoE modeling, the associated costs cannot be overlooked. Specifically, the DMM must consume network resources to support data operations for developing and using a QoE model. Therefore, it is important to select an appropriate set of MAR users for UDT establishment to improve QoE modeling accuracy while satisfying network resource constraints. Given the number of MAR users to be selected for UDT establishment, we compare two approaches to MAR user selection for UDT establishment, i.e., (i) random: randomly selecting the MAR users; and (ii) modeling-error-minimized: calculating the modeling error for each user when the user-agnostic model is adopted for this MAR user and then selecting the users with the highest modeling errors. For users without UDTs, the user-agnostic QoE model is applied.\nIn Fig. 4b, given different numbers of UDTs established, we show the QoE modeling error averaged over all MAR users. When the number of UDTs is set to 0 and 40, UDTs are established for none and all of the MAR users, respectively. With the UDTs, the average modeling error largely decreases. In addition, with the increase of the number of UDTs, the average modeling error decreases. Nevertheless, establishing more UDTs results in higher resource consumption, the trade-off between which and the modeling accuracy requires further investigation. Moreover, given the number of UDTs to be established, the modeling-error-minimized approach outper-forms the random approach in terms of modeling accuracy, which demonstrates the importance of properly selecting users for UDT establishment."}, {"title": "VI.

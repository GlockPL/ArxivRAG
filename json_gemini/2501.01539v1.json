This metric reveals how robot navigation policies can indirectly impact human empowerment. We present a framework that integrates human empowerment into the evaluation of social performance in navigation tasks. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that human empowerment as a metric not only aligns with intuitive social behavior, but also shows statistically significant differences across various robot navigation policies.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "As robots become more integrated into society, expanding beyond warehouse settings where they handled routine tasks, the need for socially compliant behavior in human environments becomes crucial not only for operational success but also for fostering social and technological sustainability. In an inclusive community where everyone can thrive, robots must navigate their surroundings with greater awareness of social conformity to the humans, ensuring that their behavior respects all individuals and reduces barriers to accessibility. Crowd navigation is one such domain in which research innovations for robots operating in society must be critically evaluated for their impact on society and the environment [1]-[3].\nInitially, humans were treated as moving obstacles, but this approach led to issues such as the freezing robot problem and oscillatory behaviors, where robots and humans get stuck in a back-and-forth motion [4]. To address these, more sophisticated methods have been developed, allowing robots to predict human motion in a predict-then-act pipeline [5] or in a coupled fashion with the robot's control action, enabling counterfactual reasoning [6]. Despite these advances, the performance metrics used to assess social compliance have remained largely unchanged, with current research focusing mostly on factors like the robot's arrival time at a goal or whether it can reach its destination without colliding with humans.\nSocial conformity has primarily been evaluated through concepts such as proxemics, which model personal space around humans and assess whether robots violate these spaces [7], [8]. Some other works have examined how these proxemic boundaries shift as humans move. For instance, rather than modeling personal space as a static ellipse or circle, the space might resemble a cone shape for a moving pedestrian [9]. Other works have focused on encoding specific social navigation rules that humans follow into robot behavior. These include rules for passing, crossing, or overtaking pedestrians [10], as well as guidelines for how robots should interact with groups of people or queues of humans [11]. Readers can refer to [12] for a comprehensive survey of existing metrics.\nHowever, even with these refinements, existing metrics fail to fully measure whether robot movement is socially compliant, as they either try to encode certain behaviors or address this problem in some specific scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a new metric based on the concept of empowerment, which has been mathematically defined in the context of robotics and reinforcement learning. Empowerment relates to an agent's ability to influence its environment in a way that it can observe. In this work, we use the information-theoretic concept of Human Empowerment to assess social compliance in crowd navigation, offering a novel way to evaluate robot behavior in human environments. Using human empowerment, we measure how robot behavior indirectly impacts human sense of agency, specifically assessing how their ability to influence the environment changes. In our setup, human ability is restricted to their motion, with observations represented through an occupancy grid map relative to them. The social behavior of robots is a broad and interdisciplinary"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Early research connecting information theory to human-robot interaction (HRI) through the concept of empowerment provided foundational insights into the control and adaptability of autonomous systems. One of the earliest works by Klyubin, Polani, and Nehaniv [20] introduced empowerment as a universal, agent-centric measure of control derived from information theory. Formally, empowerment is defined as the maximum potential for an agent to influence its environment through its actions, quantifiable via Shannon's mutual information between the agent's actions and its future states. This concept laid the groundwork for how robots could use empowerment as a guiding principle to autonomously interact with their surroundings while maximizing their ability to influence future states, which is crucial for adaptive human-robot collaboration.\nBuilding on this, Salge, Polani, and others explored empowerment as an intrinsic motivation for robots in dynamic environments, particularly focusing on sensorimotor systems. In their 2012 study, Salge et al. [21] demonstrated that maximizing empowerment enables robots to \"keep their options open,\" allowing greater flexibility and responsiveness in HRI contexts. This was further elaborated in Salge and Polani's 2013 survey [22], where empowerment was applied as an intrinsic motivation in various empirical studies, showing how robots can maintain meaningful control over interactions with humans by prioritizing flexibility and autonomy. These early works provided a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for using empowerment to specify key robotics principles [23].\nDespite rapid developments in the fields of robot navigation and human-robot interactions, the application of empowerment in social navigation remains under-explored [24]. The use"}, {"title": "III. PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "In this study, we investigate a navigation scenario within a 2-D environment $W \\subset R^2$, where a single robot operates among $N\\in R$ human pedestrians, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We let $H = \\{1, ..., N\\}$ represent the set of humans in the scene. We define the position and velocity of any agent, robot or human, using Cartesian coordinates as $s_k = [x, y]^T \\in W$ and $v_k = [v_x, v_y]^T \\in R^2$, respectively, with $k \\in N$ representing the discrete time-step and $x, y$ the axis components. The state of the robot and its control action at time-step $k$ are denoted by $X_k = [s^R_k v^R_k]^T$ and $u_k = v^R_k$, respectively. A superscript R or H is added below to indicate whether the state of interest refers to that of a robot or a human respectively.\nThe general objective of social robot navigation is to efficiently navigate the robot from its initial position to its goal location within a time limit. During navigation, the robot must avoid colliding with other humans while minimizing disruptions to their intended trajectories, which can cause discomfort. This paper focuses exclusively on motion planning, assuming the robot is equipped with onboard sensors that provide the real-time positions of surrounding human agents in the vicinity."}, {"title": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "content": "Mutual Information (MI) is a key concept in information theory that quantifies the amount of information shared between two random variables. It measures how much knowing the value of one variable reduces the uncertainty about the other, making it a versatile metric for assessing both linear and nonlinear dependencies.\nFor two random variables X and Y, mutual information is defined as:\n$I(X; Y) = \\int\\int p(x, y) \\log \\frac{p(x, y)}{p(x)p(y)} dx dy$   (1)\nwhere $p(x, y)$ is the joint probability distribution of X and Y, and $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal probability distributions of X and Y, respectively. This formulation shows that MI is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution $p(x, y)$ and the product of the marginal distributions $p(x)p(y)$. In other words, MI measures the difference between the actual joint distribution and what the distribution would be if the variables were independent.\nIn planning, MI can be computed between components such as states, actions, and future states, depending on the behavior analyzed. For example, $I(s_t; a_t)$ measures the information the current state $s_t$ provides about the action $a_t$. Similarly, $I(a_t; S_{t+1})$ captures the influence of the action $a_t$ on the resulting future state $S_{t+1}$, while $I(s_t, a_t; S_{t+1})$ evaluates the combined influence of the state-action pair $(s_t, a_t)$ on the future state $s_{t+1}$. This provides insights into the agent's decision-making process and control over the environment, making MI a powerful metric for evaluating how decisions and states impact future outcomes, valuable for analyzing control strategies."}, {"title": "B. Human Empowerment", "content": "Empowerment is a concept rooted in information theory that measures the extent to which an agent can influence its environment. It is defined as the mutual information between the agent's actions and the resulting future states of the environment. Essentially, it quantifies the agent's control over its surroundings. Unlike traditional optimization metrics, which often focus on immediate or specific objectives, empowerment emphasizes maintaining the agent's potential to influence future states, promoting behaviors that preserve adaptability and open possibilities for future decisions.\nFormally, empowerment for an agent can be expressed as $E(s) = \\max_{\\pi} I(a_t; S_{t+1}|s_t)$, where $a_t$ represents the actions the agent can take at time t, $s_t$ is the current state, and $S_{t+1}$ is the resulting future state and $\\pi$ is the agent's policy. Optimization over policies ensures that the agent selects actions that maximize its influence over future states. This approach not only enables the agent to achieve its current objectives but also retains flexibility to adapt and make meaningful decisions as the environment evolves.\nFollowing this, Human Empowerment extends the concept of empowerment to human-robot interactions, focusing on quantifying how much a human's future state is influenced by the actions they take. In this context, human empowerment measures the degree to which a human's actions affect their future states, serving as a metric for assessing how much empowerment is gained throughout a trajectory. Rather than being tied to any specific goal or objective, this metric focuses purely on the extent of influence exerted by a human's actions.\nHuman empowerment can be expressed as the mutual information between the human's actions and the resulting future states in the environment:\n$E(z^H_t) = \\max_{\\omega} I(a^H_t; z^H_{t+1}|z^H_t),$"}, {"title": "C.

This leads to the following lower bound for the mutual information:\n$\\hat{I}(a^H_t; z^H_{t+1}|z^H_t) = \\int \\int p(z^H_{t+1}, a^H_t|z^H_t) \\times \\log \\frac{p(z^H_{t+1}, a^H_t|z^H_t)}{q_{\\theta_q}(a^H_t|z^H_{t+1})p(a^H_t|z^H_t)} dz^H_{t+1}da^H_t$ (5)\nIn this formulation, $q_{\\theta_q}(a^H_t|z^H_{t+1})$ is computed by the Planning Network, while the Transition Network models $p_{\\theta_{\\tau}}(H12, a^H_t)$, and the Source Policy Network models $w_{\\theta_{\\omega}}(a^H_t|z^H_t)$. To compute this efficiently, we minimize the KL divergence between $p(a^H_t|z^H_t)$ and $q_{\\theta_q}(a^H_t|z^H_{t+1})$, leading to the following optimization objective:\n$\\hat{I}(a^H_t; z^H_{t+1}|z^H_t) \\approx E_{p_{\\theta_{\\tau}}(z^H_{t+1}|z^H_t, a^H_t)}[\\log q_{\\theta_q}(a^H_t|z^H_{t+1}) - \\log w_{\\theta_{\\omega}}(a^H_t|z^H_t)].$  (6)\nBy optimizing this objective with respect to the network parameters $\\theta_{\\omega}$, $\\theta_{\\tau}$, and $\\theta_q$, we obtain an efficient estimate of human empowerment, which captures the degree to which a human's actions influence their future states over the course of a trajectory.

The occupancy map is a grid-based structure where each cell provides information about the presence and velocity of a neighboring agent.

Each cell $e_{ij}$ in the grid contains a tuple $e_{ij} = [occupancy, v_x, V_y]:$\nEach occupancy map is ego-centric, centered around a specific human, and captures the local environment around them. The spatial grid provides an immediate snapshot of the human's surroundings, with each cell representing a discrete location in the vicinity of the human.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS", "content": "To validate our proposal of using human empowerment as a metric for measuring the performance of a robot's policy, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate the implicit influence of various policies. In this section, we present our statistical analysis to support this objective.\nWe conduct 500 trials for each of four different policies, SARL, SAC, ORCA, and Linear. The objective is to evaluate and compare the impact of these policies on human empowerment. For each trial, we calculate the Mean Empowerment, a key metric for our analysis, and subsequently perform appropriate statistical tests to validate our hypothesis.\nIn each trial, we compute human empowerment for every individual human at each time step, starting from the beginning of the scenario until the human reached their destination. Then, we compute the average empowerment of each human throughout their trajectory to capture their empowerment throughout the interaction. To derive the final metric, we calculate the average of these empowerment values across all humans in the scene, which we refer to as Mean Empowerment throughout this section. For our statistical analysis, we construct a distribution of 500 random trials for each policy and record the Mean Empowerment parameter. In each trial, we randomize the human initial position based on random seed that the learning-based policy have not seen during their training.\nWe first assess the normality of the collected data using the Shapiro-Wilk test [29] due to our sample size (500 samples per each policy) and its ability to detect deviations in both skewness and kurtosis. The null-hypothesis for this test is that the data follows a normal distribution. Our result (Table II) shows that the mean of average human empowerment is not normally distributed (p < 0.05), leading us to reject the null-hypothesis."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we introduced human empowerment as a novel metric for evaluating social compliance in crowd navigation, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics like proxemics. Our framework offers insights into how the metric captures a human's perceived sense of agency while navigating in shared spaces, and our simulations reveal statistically significant differences across various robot navigation policies. These findings suggest that human empowerment complements the assessment of how robot navigation policies affect human autonomy in dynamic environments, contributing to the broader understanding of human-robot interaction.\nHowever, we acknowledge that this work is an initial exploration of empowerment as a metric for social compliance. Future research should involve more thorough investigations and user studies to assess whether empowerment-based metrics effectively capture human perceptions of socially compliant robot behavior. Additionally, exploring other forms of empowerment, such as transfer empowerment or robot empowerment, could provide deeper insights into human-robot interactions in social navigation contexts.\nMoreover, we believe empowerment-based metrics have potential beyond evaluation and could be used in the behavior design for social navigation. By incorporating these metrics into the design process, future systems could better balance autonomy with social compliance, enhancing the quality of human-robot interaction in complex, shared environments."}]}

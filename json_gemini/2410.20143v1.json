It then presents an overview of all the contributions of this thesis.\nIn recent years, digital democracy has garnered significant interest, captivating researchers and gaining widespread social support. The growing recognition of the importance of providing equitable representation for every citizen and engaging them directly in decision-making processes has propelled the emergence of citizen-centric governance. Among the various applications of this approach, the one that stands out as particularly noteworthy and currently captures the spotlight is participatory budgeting.\nParticipatory Budgeting (PB) is a voting paradigm that deals with the situations where a divisible resource (such as money, time etc.) is to be distributed among a set of projects by taking the preferences of stakeholders over the projects into account. The divisible resource that is to be distributed is typically referred to as the budget, whereas the stakeholders are typically referred to as voters.\nPB finds immediate application in various domains, including government funding the public projects, where the preferences of citizens are aggregated to make funding decisions. It is also used by conference organizers to manage talk schedules, taking into account the preferences of the audience. Additionally, companies employ PB to select research proposals for funding, by aggregating the preferences of the selection panel.\nThe success of PB is evident through its widespread adoption in numerous countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Germany, Austria, and the United States [27, 74, 77, 79, 89]. Several platforms such as Polys platform"}, {"title": "Landscape of PB Models", "content": "The PB models can be broadly classified with respect to three axes: (i) preferences of the voters (ii) costs of the projects (iii) objective of the PB rule. Let us look at PB through each of these lenses and understand the variants of PB models.\nWhen approaching a voting problem, the initial consideration often revolves around the design of the ballots. The field of social choice offers various approaches for voters to express their preferences regarding the projects under consideration. Furthermore, the participatory budgeting literature proposes additional methods for eliciting preferences that are tailored specifically to PB. In the following discussion, we introduce all the potential ballot formats suitable for PB and illustrate them with a running example.\n\u2022 Dichotomous preferences: Every voter reports for each project whether or not she likes the project. In other words, each voter is asked to report a subset of project she likes.\n\u2022 Ordinal preferences: Every voter gives an ordering or ranking over the projects under consideration.\n\u2022 Cardinal preferences: Every voter assigns to each project a numerical value that quantifies her liking for the project."}, {"title": "Costs in PB", "content": "In participatory budgeting, the cost of a project signifies the amount that needs to be allocated to the project in the event of its selection for funding. However, the specific context and application of PB can introduce limitations on the funds dedicated to each project. As a consequence, the following scenarios may arise:\n\u2022 Restricted costs: The cost of each project is restricted to a single value. A project must either receive an amount exactly equal to this value or must be not funded at all.\n\u2022 Flexible costs: The amount allocated to each project is permitted to assume multiple values. This is further split into two possible scenarios:\nPartially flexible: A project can be implemented upto different degrees of sophistication and every degree corresponds to a different cost. The amount allocated to the project by the PB rule must belong to this set of permissible costs.\nTotally flexible: There is no restriction on the amount allocated to each project. That is, projects do not have any associated cost(s) and any amount can be allocated to each project."}, {"title": "Objectives of PB", "content": "As in any social choice setting, PB aims to achieve two primary objectives: maximizing welfare and promoting fairness. Though the precise definitions of welfare and fairness depend on the specific PB model and its application, we informally explain below an overarching idea of what these objectives stand for. In the subsequent chapters, we will provide formal definitions of these concepts, following the introduction of each specific PB model.\n\u2022 Maximizing welfare: Utility of a voter is a function that quantifies the benefit a voter derives from an outcome. Various welfare measures are formulated with respect to a given utility notion. We explain three such prominent measures below:\nUtilitarian welfare: This is the sum of utilities of all the voters. An outcome that maximizes utilitarian welfare selects a subset of projects that maximizes the sum of utility of all the voters such that the total cost of the set is within the budget.\nEgalitarian welfare: This is the utility of the worst-off voter, or in other words, the least of the utilities of all the voters. An outcome that maximizes egalitarian welfare selects a subset of projects that maximizes the utility of the worst-off voter such that the total cost of the set is within the budget.\nNash welfare: This is the geometric mean of utilities of all the voters, and is often viewed as a trade-off between utilitarian and egalitarian welfare.\n\u2022 Achieving fairness: Fairness notions are established with the primary aim of guaranteeing equitable treatment for all voters or ensuring that they receive the treatment they deserve. Various approaches exist to uphold this principle. In the following discussion, we provide an informal explanation of some such ideas.\nGuarantee-based fairness: Certain notions of individual-fairness guarantee that each voter should find satisfaction with at least a predetermined fraction of the budget allocation. Meanwhile, various group-fairness notions dictate that for a group of voters, an amount proportionate to their group size must be allocated in accordance with their collective preferences.\nEgalitarian fairness: The goal of maximizing egalitarian welfare is also often viewed as a fairness goal that ensures that a voter from a minority group is treated on an equal footing with a voter from the majority group. This objective aims to promote symmetry in the treatment of individuals, irrespective of their strength."}, {"title": "Relating the Thesis to the State-of-the-Art", "content": "We first contextualize the thesis within the landscape discussed in the preceding section.

Thus, the literature, with an exception of the work by Laruelle [57], only focused on utilitarian welfare [13, 16, 45, 51, 54, 57, 73, 85]. Likewise, when it comes to fairness, all the existing works, other than the work by Laruelle [57], looked at a guarantee-based fairness notion called proportionality [8, 26, 38, 43, 57, 60] which ensures that every group of cohesive voters (i.e., voters having similar preferences) must receive a utility proportional to their group size. Both utilitarian welfare and proportionality suffer a common drawback: they are majority driven."}, {"title": "Dichotomous Preferences - Flexible Costs", "content": "The existing work on PB under dichotomous preferences and flexible costs assumes that the costs are totally flexible and that any amount can be allocated to any project [10, 21, 32].

Welfare maximization in PB under restricted costs and ordinal preferences is studied by Benade et al. [14] and Laurelle [57]. Benade et al. [14] assume that all the voters implicitly have cardinal preferences over the projects and that the PB organizer has access only to the ordinal preferences induced by these cardinal preferences. In other words, ordinal preferences are assumed to act as a proxy to the implicit cardinal preferences. Under this assumption, the authors quantified the distortion or loss in the utilitarian welfare caused due to the lack of access to cardinal preferences. However, this work comes with a set of drawbacks: (i) many times, the implicit preferences of the voters could simply be weakly ordinal and not cardinal (ii) they assume that the ordinal preferences are strict, whereas in real world, voters could be indifferent between two projects (iii) they assume that every voter has a preference over every project, whereas in real world, voters could have preferences only over a few projects and have no opinion on the others. Laurelle [57] experimentally evaluated a sub-optimal greedy algorithm to maximize welfare, but did not study any PB rules that achieve optimal welfare. We bridge all these gaps in Section 5.3 of Chapter 5, wherein we propose PB rules that achieve optimal utilitarian welfare for PB under incomplete weakly ordinal preferences.\nFairness. While the egalitarian fairness for PB under ordinal preferences and restricted costs is studied by Laurelle [57], the guarantee-based fairness notions are studied by Aziz and Lee [4] and Pierczynski et al. [69]. Aziz and Lee [4] proposed two fairness notions, CPSC (Comparative Proportionality for Solid Coalitions) and IPSC (Inclusive Proportionality for Solid Coalitions), and Pierczynski et al. [69] followed the same lines of fairness (though their results are for cardinal preferences, they could be applied to ordinal preferences). Notably,"}, {"title": "Ordinal Preferences - Flexible Costs", "content": "For the space of PB under ordinal preferences and totally flexible costs, several works studied individual-fairness [1, 6, 9] and a few papers looked at group-fairness [9, 37]. The existing fairness notions have a few limitations. The first limitation is that they assume all the voters to have equal rights over the budget. However, there could be many real-world scenarios where each group is endowed with a different entitlement. One such example is the use of affirmative actions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action) by numerous governments in the world to uplift the minority and historically discriminated groups. The government may want the underprivileged groups to have a say on higher fraction of the budget. The second limitation arises when the existing notions are applied to strictly ordinal preferences: the notions simply reduce to dictatorship and yield unfavorable outcomes. In Chapter 6, we will illustrate this weakness with multiple examples. Finally, in Section 6.5, we propose fairness notions that overcome these disadvantages. We further characterize group-fair and individually-fair PB rules that also satisfy other desirable properties."}, {"title": "Thesis Contributions and Overview", "content": "In this section, we outline the structure of the thesis and offer a concise overview of the key technical contributions presented in each chapter.

It involves aggregating preferences of stakeholders (referred to as voters) to decide how the budget should be allocated to the projects.

Computational complexity theory, in general, focuses on classifying problems into specific complexity classes, such that all the problems within a class are understood to have similar complexity [64]. This thesis investigates the time complexity of various participatory budgeting problems. We briefly introduce the background on time complexity classes.\nThe problems in theoretical computer science are broadly classified into two categories: decision problems and optimization problems. A decision problem focuses on verifying whether or not a solution satisfying required properties exist. Alternatively, the corresponding optimization problem computes such a solution(s). Clearly, optimization version of a problem is at least as hard as its decision version. So, the positive results are usually presented for the optimization version, whereas the negative/impossibility results are presented for the latter."}, {"title": "P and NP", "content": "The most fundamental classes of time complexity of problems are P and NP. The class P is a collection of all problems that can be solved in polynomial (in size of the input) time using a deterministic Turing machine, whereas the class NP is a collection of all those problems that can be solved in polynomial time using a non-deterministic Turing machine. The query on whether or not P and NP classes are equal remains an open question. However, it is widely believed that P \u2260 NP.\nFor the sake of simplicity, our statements in the thesis are with respect to a deterministic Turing machine. We refer to the problems in P as polynomial-time solvable or computationally tractable problems, and those in NP or in the classes more complex than NP as computationally hard or intractable problems. To prove that an optimization problem is in P, we propose algorithms that run in polynomial time in size of the input. To prove that an optimization problem is computationally hard, we generally define its decision version and prove that it is at least as hard as an existing decision problem in NP class. We achieve this by a process of reduction of one problem to the other.\nFormally, a decision problem is encoded as a language $D \\subseteq \\Sigma^*$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$.\nA decision problem $D_1$ reduces to another decision problem $D_2$ if there exists a polynomial-time computable function $f$ such that for every $x \\in \\Sigma^*$, $x \\in D_1 \\leftrightarrow f(x) \\in D_2$.\nA decision problem $D$ is said to be NP-hard if all problems in NP reduce to $D$.

But does it become tractable for special families of instances that satisfy a specific property or structure?\n(ii) The problem is intractable, which means that it is not known to be solved in polynomial-time. Could it be partially tractable? If yes, what must be the definition of partial tractability?\n(iii) Finding an optimal solution is found to be intractable. Would it be tractable to find a sub-optimal solution close to the optimal solution? If yes, how should the closeness be defined?\nFor the first direction, we look at families of instances satisfying a certain property. For example, in the space of instances of PB under dichotomous preferences, we could confine to instances with only knapsack votes (since knapsack votes are a special case of dichotomous preferences). We could also impose other properties on the instances and shrink the space of instances further."}, {"title": "Partial Tractability", "content": "For the second direction, we discuss two notions of partial tractability from the literature: pseudo-polynomial time tractability and fixed parameter tractability.\nA problem $D$ is said to be computed in polynomial time (and thus lie in P) if its running time is a polynomial in the size of the instance $I$, i.e., in the number of bits used to represent the instance. In other words, the running time must be $O(|I|^c)$ for some constant $c$, where the size $|I| = O(\\log I)$.\nOn the flip side, $D$ is said to be computed in pseudo-polynomial time if its running time is a polynomial in the size of $I$ when $I$ is expressed in unary. In other words, the running must be $O(|I|^c)$ for some constant $c$, where the size $|I| = I$.\nA NP-hard problem is said to be weakly NP-hard if it is solvable in pseudo-polynomial time and strongly NP-hard otherwise.\nAn alternative way to define partial tractability is to identify the specific parameter(s) of an instance that is the primary cause of intractability and demonstrate that the running time is polynomial when this particular parameter remains constant [31]. To formally define this, we first define the problem in terms of parameter.\nFormally, a parameterized decision problem is encoded as a language $D \\subseteq \\Sigma^* \\times \\Sigma^*$, where $\\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet. The second part of the problem indicates the parameter.\nA parameterized decision problem $D$ is said to be fixed parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k$ if it can be decided whether or not $(I, k) \\in D$ by an algorithm in $f(k).|I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $f$ is an arbitrary computable function depending only on $k$."}, {"title": "Approximation Algorithms", "content": "Finally, we discuss the third direction of coping up with intractability, in which we find a sub-optimal solution in polynomial time and quantify its closeness to the optimal solution. This is precisely achieved by what are called as approximation algorithms in the literature.\nIf the objective in an optimization problem $O_D$ is to maximize a given function, we call the problem a maximization problem. Likewise, if the objective is to minimize, we refer to the problem as a minimization problem. Let $Y$ denote the space of all the possible input instances of the problem $O_D$. Let $ALG$ denote a polynomial-time approximation algorithm returning a sub-optimal solution for the problem, whereas $OPT$ denotes the optimal algorithm (optimizes the objective exactly). The approximation ratio of $ALG$ denotes the ratio between the optimal value of the objective and the value returned by $ALG$, in the worst case scenario. Formally, we define it below.\nFor a maximization problem, approximation ratio of an algorithm is the maximum value $\\zeta \\in (0, 1]$ such that $ALG(I) > \\zeta \\cdot OPT(I)$ for every $I \\in Y$. For a minimization problem, approximation ratio of an algorithm is the minimum value $\\zeta > 1$ such that $ALG(I) \\le \\zeta \\cdot OPT(I)$ for every $I \\in Y$.\nBy definition, approximation ratio can never be 1. Garey and Johnson [47] further introduced the concept of approximation schemes, which is to propose a single polynomial-time algorithm with an accuracy parameter $\\epsilon$ such that it always guarantees an approximation ratio that is a function of $\\epsilon$ and very close to 1. We formally define them below.\nAn algorithm $ALG$ for the problem $O_D$ is said to be a PTAS, if for a given accuracy parameter $\\epsilon > 0$, for every instance $I \\in Y$, it holds that $ALG(I) > (1 - \\epsilon) \\cdot OPT(I)$ when $O_D$ is a maximization problem and $ALG(I) \\le (1 + \\epsilon) \\cdot OPT(I)$ when it is a minimization problem.\nNote that closer the $\\epsilon$ is to 1, stronger is the approximation ratio. This means that, though getting an approximation ratio of 1 is intractable, getting a ratio arbitrarily close to 1 is tractable. An algorithm with a running time $O(|I|^{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}})$ is also a PTAS. The next approximation scheme prohibits $\\epsilon$ from taking such a position in the exponent.\nAn algorithm $ALG$ is said to be a FPTAS, if it is a PTAS whose running time is $O(|I|^{O(1)}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{O(1)})$, where $|I|$ is the input size and $\\epsilon$ is the accuracy parameter."}, {"title": "Restricted Costs: Egalitarian Participatory Budgeting", "content": "Egalitarianism plays a crucial role in participatory budgeting (PB), functioning as both a welfare and fairness objective, as discussed in Section 1.1.

In participatory budgeting under dichotomous preferences, one way to define the utility of a voter is to base it on the number of approved projects of the voter that are funded [54, 69, 73]. This notion, however, fails to capture the role played by the size of a project, as demonstrated below in Example 3.1.\nThis immediately motivates other well-studied notion of utility, namely, the total amount allocated to the approved projects of the voter [10, 21, 32, 45, 51, 85], also explained in Section 2.1.2.1. Assuming that the utility of a voter is the total amount allocated to its approved projects, the natural question that follows is to decide the appropriate objective of participatory budgeting.\nWhen the objective of participatory budgeting is to maximize welfare, Fluschnik et al. [43] studied Nash welfare maximization, which is to maximize the geometric mean of utilities of all the voters. The authors proved that maximizing Nash welfare is computationally hard even for the most restricted special case with just two voters and unit cost projects (their results assume cardinal preferences, but can also be trivially extended to the setting with dichotomous preferences). This resulted in most works focusing on the maximization of utilitarian welfare, which is the sum of utilities of all the voters [13, 16, 45, 51, 57, 85].\nOn the other hand, when the objective of participatory budgeting is to achieve fairness, most works looked at a guarantee-based fairness notion called proportionality [8, 26, 38, 43, 57, 60] which ensures that every group of cohesive voters (i.e., voters having similar preferences) must receive a utility proportional to their group size. Notably, both the objectives of achieving utilitarian welfare maximization and proportionality suffer a major disadvantage of being majority-driven.

We propose an algorithm that achieves, for MPB, additive approximation guarantees for several restricted spaces of instances and empirically show that our approximation algorithm in fact gives exact optimal solutions on real-world PB datasets. We also establish an upper bound on the approximation ratio achievable for MPB by the family of exhaustive strategy-proof PB algorithms, thereby quantifying the loss in welfare incurred due to strategy-proofness.\nIn the second part (Section 3.5), we undertake an axiomatic study of the MPB rule by generalizing known axioms in the literature.

Utility of a voter $i$ from a set of projects $S$ is defined as the amount of money allocated to the projects approved by $i$, i.e., $u_i(S) = c(A_i \\cap S)$."}, {"title": "Computational Results", "content": "We first prove the hardness of MPB and present some tractable special cases based on certain well-motivated parameters. We then give an approximation algorithm for MPB and show empirically that, in fact, it gives exact optimal solutions on real-world PB datasets. We conclude the section by establishing an upper bound on the approximation ratio achieved for MPB by any exhaustive strategy-proof PB algorithm. We start by formulating MPB as the following integer linear program (ILP) where each variable $x_p$ corresponds to selection of the project $p$.\n$$\\begin{aligned} \\text"}]}

It emphasises the potential of mini-grids, which can operate independently or in conjunction with national power grids, to provide reliable and affordable electricity to remote communities. Given the inherent unpredictability of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, the necessity for accurate energy forecasting and management is discussed, highlighting the role of advanced AI techniques in forecasting energy supply and demand, optimising grid operations, and ensuring sustainable energy distribution.

One potential solution to this problem is the use of mini-grids, which are small-scale electrical systems that generate and distribute electricity to a specific, often localised, geographical area. Mini-grids can be powered by various energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and diesel generators, and can be designed to operate in conjunction with or independent of the national power grid [4].\nMini-grids are a rapidly evolving technology due to the number of advantages they provide over typical national grid systems. Firstly, mini-grids can provide affordable and more reliable electricity to remote communities that have no connection, or an unreli-"}, {"title": "Forecasting Techniques: Technical Analysis", "content": "Forecasting is the process of predicting future events or trends based on historical data and other pertinent information. It is a critical tool for businesses, governments, and other organisations that need to plan for the future and make informed decisions. Forecasting is used in a wide range of applications, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and supply chain management [61].\nSelecting an appropriate model is essential to achieving accurate forecasts. This can be a difficult decision due to the large number of models to choose from, each with its own strengths and limitations. The choice of model can depend on factors such as the nature of the data, the forecasting horizon, and the complexity of the relationships within the data.\nTypically, AI-driven mini-grid systems consist of three core components, each requiring accurate and timely forecasting:\n\u2022 A forecast for the energy supply from all distributed energy resources connected to the mini-grid. Since the mini-grid will aim to be heavily reliant on renewable resources, a successful forecast will require accurate information on a variety of physical attributes, such as local weather patterns, temperature, cloud cover, and other unspecific atmospheric effects.\n\u2022 A forecast for the energy demand from the consumers of the mini-grid. This will require detailed knowledge of typical consumer behaviours and routines within the region, as well as information on upcoming important regional events.\n\u2022 A forecast for the optimal operation and management of the mini-grid is essential. Once the energy supply and demand are forecast, a model must determine"}, {"title": "Statistical and Intelligent Techniques for Forecasting", "content": "This review focuses on mini-grid systems that utilise renewable energy, with wind and solar as the primary distributed energy resources. Due to the inherently chaotic nature of weather and the strong dependence of renewable energy systems on current atmospheric conditions, forecasts for energy generation from renewable power sources usually fall within a short or very short forecast horizon [46].\nTechniques used within forecasting typically fall into one of four categories [25, 46]: physical prediction models [55, 33, 50, 18], statistical models [71, 66, 11, 41], intelligent computational algorithms [22, 36, 54, 23, 35], and hybrid models [44, 62, 52].\nThe simplest type of forecasting model, typically used as a baseline for other models, is called the persistence model. This model typically assumes that the value at the next time-step will simply be equal to the value at the current time-step [15, 31]. This model is considered naive since it doesn't involve any intelligent or statistical techniques and makes a base assumption of continuity within the data. Slightly more complex persistence models can factor in the gradient of change of the time-series which produced the current time-step, and again assumes that the gradient will remain constant over time.\nA physical forecasting model attempts to use the known laws of physics in order to simulate future atmospheric conditions, and the corresponding weather patterns, and thus forecast potential energy generation. The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model is widely regarded as the prevailing technique for physical modelling within weather forecasting [42, 19, 37]. The NWP model typically functions by dividing the atmosphere into a three-dimensional grid of cells, with each cell containing information about the temperature, pressure, wind speed, and humidity at that location. The model then relies on the physical theories of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics to simulate the way these variables will interact and change over time and predicts how the weather will evolve [13]. Fundamental challenges to NWP models include the expertise in mathematics and physics required for their development and effective utilisation, alongside the required substantial computational power and resources, potentially restricting access for smaller or less developed countries [67, 13].\nStatistical models are widely used techniques for forecasting time-series data due to their relative simplicity and ease of implementation [45]. These models typically utilise statistical techniques such as Auto-regression (AR) and Moving-averages (MA), or a combination of both (ARMA) [48]. Auto-regression is a common time-series analysis method that aims to model the relationship between a time-series and its past values, utilising techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to minimise the error between the predicted and actual values [20, 46]. Moving-averages involve taking an average of residuals"}, {"title": "Forecasting Techniques: Implementations", "content": "When moving from theory to implementation, the effectiveness of each forecasting technique is heavily influenced by the exact parameters of the forecasting problem, especially the data and resources available. As demonstrated in this section, no single forecasting technique excels in all scenarios, especially when considering the desired forecasting horizon. The forecasting horizon denotes the time duration for which a forecast is made, representing a future period over which predictions are generated. Although names and definitions may vary, the commonly accepted forecasting horizons include:\n\u2022 Very short-term. From a second to 30 minutes.\n\u2022 Short-term. From 30 minutes to 6 hours.\n\u2022 Medium-term. From 6 hours and 1 day."}, {"title": "Energy Generation Forecasting", "content": "Mini-grids usually rely on renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, and a backup diesel generator to provide power. Due to the weather dependency of the renewable assets, predicting the power available at a future time will require accurate information on future weather conditions, as well as the availability of the energy assets [34]."}, {"title": "Energy Demand Forecasting", "content": "Accurately forecasting the energy demand of mini-grid consumers is essential for any mini-grid management solution. This accurate forecasting is crucial for determining whether the energy generated by the grid's renewable resources will be sufficient to meet demand at all times. This is especially important since the grid's backup diesel generators will most likely require preparation and startup time before it can effectively meet energy demands. Combined with energy generation forecasts, it will become easier to provide a more reliable grid and better forecast grid maintenance."}, {"title": "Energy Management Forecasting", "content": "The forecasting of mini-grid management and operations plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliable and efficient functioning of mini-grid systems. Accurate operation forecasts would enable mini-grid operators to optimise the deployment and scheduling of all energy resources, better plan maintenance activities, ensure grid stability and make informed decisions regarding energy procurement and storage capacity. Reliable forecasting would minimise operational costs, lower carbon emissions by reducing reliance on diesel backup generators, and ultimately enhance the overall reliability and sustainability of the mini-grid system."}, {"title": "Public Datasets for Testing", "content": "Since it will take time to install and generate real data from the project mini-grid, any model development will require large amounts of relevant real-world data or at least accurate simulated data."}, {"title": "Electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data from Spain", "content": "This dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather, contains 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain with a 1-hour frequency.

However, it is important to consider potential challenges associated with the data. One such challenge stems from the dataset covering a broad geographical area, rather than a localised mini-grid setting. Additionally, variations in climate trends between Spain and the target country, as well as distinct cultural practices and holidays specific to each region, may pose additional considerations.\nThe dataset is also potentially limited by the lack of information on Carbon emissions from the various energy sources, as well as information regarding energy trading prices. Since energy forecasting involves a multi-objective optimisation problem aimed at balancing cost, carbon footprint, and hardware operations and maintenance, additional external information needs to be incorporated into this dataset to achieve these objectives."}, {"title": "Appliances Energy Prediction", "content": "The \"Appliance Energy Prediction\u201d dataset available on the UCI repository [14] can be used to fit forecasting models for energy usage in household appliances.

It was introduced by Oreshkin et al. in 2020. N-BEATS is designed to capture complex temporal patterns in time series data and provide accurate and interpretable forecasts [53].\nN-BEATS works by decomposing a time series into a set of basic patterns called \"basis functions\" which represent different types of patterns that can occur in the data, such as trends, seasonality, or fluctuations. N-BEATS uses a neural network architecture, composed of fully connected (FC) layers, to learn the coefficients and weights associated with each basis function. These coefficients determine the importance or contribution of each basis function at different points in time. It starts with a large set of basis functions and progressively selects the most influential ones, removing the less important ones during training. N-BEATS offers interpretability by providing insights into the underlying patterns. The learned basis functions can be visualised to understand which patterns are driving the forecasts, helping users gain insights into the data.\nAs an example, the N-BEATS tool allows for quick analysis of the features of the dataset to determine the correlation between the features.

The integration of various forecasting techniques, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and hybrid approaches, has demonstrated the capability to address the inherent unpredictability of renewable energy sources. Accurate forecasting of energy supply and demand is crucial for optimising mini-grid operations and ensuring reliable and cost-effective energy distribution.\nThe exploration of tools such as Prophet, NeuralProphet, and N-BEATS has shown promising results in improving forecast accuracy and interpretability. These tools provide valuable insights into trends, seasonality, and the impact of external factors such as weather and holidays on energy consumption and generation.

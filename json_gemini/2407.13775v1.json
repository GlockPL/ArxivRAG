Until autonomous vehicles mature, such advisory systems will continue to expand their ability to cooperate with drivers, enabling safer and more eco-friendly driving practices while improving user experience. However, the interactions between these systems and drivers have not been studied extensively. To this end, we conduct a driving simulator study (N=16) to capture driver reactions to a Cooperative RTA system. Through a case study with a congestion mitigation assistant, we qualitatively analyze the sentiments of drivers towards advisory systems and discuss driver preferences for various aspects of the interaction. We comment on how the advice should be communicated, the effects of the advice on driver trust, and how drivers adapt to the system. We present recommendations to inform the future design of Cooperative RTA systems.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Drivers everywhere rely on Real-time Advisory (RTA) systems almost every day, popularly in the forms of navigational [1-4] and eco-driving assistants [5\u201310]. With the improvements in intelligent driving systems, new RTA systems are continually proposed to aid in driving scenarios such as controlled takeovers [11-14] and safe decision making [15\u201318]. These RTA systems are deployed inside vehicles through onboard systems developed by car manufacturers in the form of Advanced Driver Assistant Systems (ADAS) at Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) level 2 autonomy [19], or through the use of smartphones [20, 21]. With increasing demand for such RTA systems, Autonomous Vehicles (AV) pose as the natural solution to encapsulate issues that these systems address. However, the market penetration of AVs is likely to be delayed due to safety risks [22, 23] and economic factors [24-26], particularly in developing countries with large driving populations [27]. Thus, the development of these systems for such underserved markets, usually through SAE level 2 systems, can have a significant impact on our future.\nThese new developments continue to increase the time granularity of how frequently RTA systems advise drivers ranging from landmark-based events in navigation and turning assistants [3, 4] to second-by-second advice in eco-driving and speed advisory assistants [28\u201330]. As this time granularity increases, the interactions between these systems and drivers must be formulated with careful consideration. One avenue of improving user experiences with such time-precise systems is through the inclusion of cooperative features [31-33], resulting in Cooperative Real-time Advisory (CoRTA) systems (illustrated in Figure 1). Such CoRTA systems are cognizant of driver behavior and preferences, and thus allow for enhanced interactions with drivers. These interactions are likely to not only inform user experiences, but also to impact driver trust in automation, and hence, influence the efficiency of downstream Human-Vehicle teaming tasks (e.g. eco-driving) [34, 31].\nThe influence of AV behaviors on driver-vehicle interactions are widely studied at the SAE Level 3 or higher. Particularly, the impact of different AV behaviors on driver attitudes (e.g. trust, comfort) towards these systems has been extensively researched, to inform future designs using driving simulator studies [35, 33, 36], semi-structured interviews [37, 34], and meta-surveys [38, 31]. For example, a driving simulator study to capture the effects of assertive AV takeover maneuvers (i.e. the transfer of control of the vehicle between automation and the driver) by Kraut et al. [35] found that such behaviors invoked a faster"}, {"title": "II. METHOD", "content": "In this section, we first provide a short summary of the policies used in our CoRTA systems. We also introduce our user study, its procedure, and the user interface employed for the user study.\nAs shown in Figure 1, CORTA systems are designed to provide a driver with some advice on how they should act in real-time while adapting to drivers' style and situational environmental factors. Piecewise Constant (PC) Policies [49] exemplify such cooperative systems to address congestion mitigation, i.e. the reduction or dampening of stop-and-go waves in traffic [51, 48]. PC policies are policies trained using reinforcement learning that require the current action, i.e. the advice, to be held constant for a period of time \u2013 referred to as the hold-length, \u03b4. Sridhar and Wu [49] designed this hold period to account for the time taken by drivers to react to and act upon the advice, and hence enabled the policies to be cooperative. Residual variants [30] of such policies enable further cooperative behaviors through the use of driver trait inference modules. These policies aim to advise drivers of the speed that should be maintained in order to mitigate congestion. In our case study, we use PC policies and two of their residual variants\u00b9 that observe the driver and their environment to provide speed advice (See Appendix A for details). Particularly, we utilize 9 different policies: 3 policy types \u00d7 3 different hold-lengths: d = {5,7,10} seconds. The policies exhibited diverse behaviors in the speed advice they recommend and how the speed advice changes in real-time. For example, the advised speeds range between slow, \"just right\", or fast speeds, and there are either frequent or no changes, and even incremental or large changes in the advised speed. Some policies advise a sequence of speeds that when acted upon by drivers are intended to amount to a different, more effective speed advice i.e. such policies are not direct in communicating their advised speeds. Other policies are transparent and advise drivers on"}, {"title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "In this section, we provide our conclusions on the do's and don'ts for CORTA systems, that are summarized in Table I. All participant responses were edited by a research assistant to remove filler words (e.g. 'like', 'umm') to shorten responses that were verbose or repetitive. Then, thematic coding was performed using NVivo14 on the responses by a single coder to seek sentiments relevant to our research questions. After all responses had been coded, resulting themes and significant quotes were identified and used to construct the analysis presented here. To enhance quote understanding we replace verbiage and add context (between [brackets]) for some responses. We attest that the context and sentiments of participants are presented as they were intended. Note that we refer to each participant as P## where ## is the number assigned to them between 1 and 16.\nOur interviews revealed multiple behaviors and characteristics of real-time advisory systems that significantly affected participant experiences. Unsurprisingly, the most significant attribute of the advice that drivers seek is accuracy (as it pertains to them). Although in the quote above, P11 described accuracy as the ability of the policy to keep them safe, other factors such as the value of the advised speeds, the frequency of speed changes, the magnitude of the changes, time period to react to advice, and the understandability of the advice were all important contributors. These behaviors affected drivers' trust in the system, and led to drivers adapting their driving style, and, in some extremes, ignoring the advice completely."}, {"title": "B. \u201cWhat did you think of the User Interface?", "content": "Participants found the use of the speedometer to communicate the advice controversial. P06 said that the UI was \"definitely pretty easy to follow... but at times it was a bit distracting.\" This sentiment was shared by 8 other participants, where P09, in particular, felt strongly that \"staring at the speedometer is not safe.\" Users shared that driving was already a load incentive task due to the requirement of paying attention to the road and the other vehicles and adding \"any kind of instructions is actually another layer of burden that you impose on the driver\" (P12). Thus, the increased load diverted drivers away from the main driving task \u201coverwhelmed\u201d (P06) them and created opportunities for unsafe scenarios. However, 3 of 9 participants noted that the use of the speedometer was a major issue only in the cases where the behavior of the advice increased the drivers' mental load. Therefore, we advise selective use of this visual modality.\nSome drivers mentioned that they viewed the advice solely as a suggestion and only kept the speedometer in their peripheral vision, as they would in real life. These drivers mentioned that doing so \"eased the amount of mental load a little bit\" (P05) but adversely affected how precise they were in following the advice. Furthermore, the use of the green bar to indicate an acceptable range was touted by drivers as \"helpful\" (P12) as it gave them more \"flexibility\" (P14). P11 mentioned that the green bar facilitated easier instruction adherence as finding \"the right amount to press the pedal, for example, to get exactly on the red line is pretty difficult.\" However, some drivers felt that \"the margin was a little small\" (P16) and wished that the green range had been a little larger to allow for more leeway in how precisely the advice was followed, \"but it wasn't a big deal\" (P16).\nParticipants also reacted positively to coloring the speed value (displayed on the speedometer) green when they were driving within the advised range and proclaimed it as a \"good touch\" (P15). P15 also mentioned that changing the color of the number \"made me look at the actual [gauge] less and just look at the big number and that didn't take as much attention\". The color choice also helped in minimizing the load on participants as they were \"looking for green\" (P05)"}, {"title": "C. \u201cDid You Find Yourself Adapting to the System?", "content": "While users have preferences for the systems' behavior, we observed that drivers adapted their own driving during their interactions with the system in an effort to improve their experience. Towards the latter trials, some users formed simple rules around when and how they would follow advice. These rules differed for each participant and were informed by their previous experiences with the different policies and their behaviors. For example, P16 said that they would always check the distance to the car ahead of them first. Then if they determined the distance was large enough and their speed was less than or at 30 mph they would \"feel comfortable driving a little faster,\" if the policy suggested it. Else, they would only listen to the policy if it advised them to slow down. Otherwise, they would \"do nothing.\" Alternately, we observed that P07 would ignore all advice that was over 20 mph as they felt \"unable to control the vehicle at larger speeds\", regardless of their distance to the car ahead of them. While P07 did not provide a reason for their decision, we posit that they formed"}, {"title": "D. \u201cWould you use these systems?", "content": "From the results of the questionnaires and interactions with participants we conclude that the policies tested during the study are not deployable without modifications, due to the drawbacks discussed previously. However, while the systems might not suggest perfectly accurate advice, participants still found auxiliary uses for the policies. First, participants mentioned using the system to affirm their own driving styles and speeds. Particularly, P12 mentioned the advised speed \u201creassure[d] that the speed that [they] want to drive is correct\u201d when the advice \u201cmatches [their] optimal speed in [their] mind\u201d. Others mentioned their interactions with the system made them feel \u201cvery validated in [their] driving choices\u201d (P10). Second, users said that they would suggest the usage of this system as a"}, {"title": "IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "Limitations and Future Work: While the findings presented above provide important insights into driver interactions with advisory systems, our methods are not without limitations. Firstly, we believe that a larger user study with a more diverse population is merited due to the smaller range in participant experiences in our study. Particularly, while our population addresses the sentiments of a significant portion of drivers, it does not reflect the needs of the majority. Secondly, our participants experienced all study procedures in a lab environment with a driving simulator. While driving simulators are helpful in evaluating user sentiments in automotive settings, they lack the psychological and physical level feedback mechanisms offered by naturalistic driving. A naturalistic driving study in a controlled environment to evaluate CORTA systems would provide further credence to our findings. Lastly, our study was designed to capture qualitative user sentiments for one style of UI design. Performing a comparative study with multiple other UI options would be conducive in arriving at a definite UI framework for CoRTA systems. Therefore, a systematic study that includes such definite quantitative methods to capture user perceptions would corroborate our findings."}, {"title": "APPENDIX", "content": "The quantitative results in Table II are in agreement with the qualitative feedback discussed in Section III-A. The table shows aggregates for the Raw TLX Score computed from the NASA TLX questionnaire, the SUS Score, and the usage score computed with simple Likert scale statistical analysis (1=Very Unlikely; 5=Very Likely) on the responses to the question \"How likely are you to use this system while driving on the highway?\".\nWe observe a clear trend where systems with larger hold-lengths are determined to be less load inducing (lower TLX) and more usable (higher SUS) in Table II. Our findings are further corroborated by Univariate analysis of ANOVA tests that indicate statistically significant differences in the effect of the hold-length as the independent variable with the RAW TLX Score (F2,144 = 51.143, p < 0.01) and the SUS Score (F2,144 = 40.456, p < 0.005) as dependent variables, respectively. While the TLX and SUS scores indicate that participants would prefer to use the systems with larger hold-lengths, the usage scores presented correspond to a general \"Neutral\" feeling. Therefore, we conclude that the systems in their current state would not be desirable for use in the real world without enhancements to address driver concerns\u00b9.\nFormally, PC policies, \u03c0PC : S \u2192 A, process an observed state st \u2208 S and output an action $a^{advice} = a_t \u2208 A$, such that $q^{advice}_{at} = q_{at+1} = ... = q_{at + \u03b4 - 1}$. The driver is recommended the action $a^{advice}$ and acts upon it in the vehicle according to their wishes. We refer interested readers to the works by Sridhar and Wu [49], Li et al. [56], Cho et al. [50], Jayawardana and Wu [29], and Hasan et al. [30] for a more in depth discussion on PC policies and their variants\u00b9."}]}

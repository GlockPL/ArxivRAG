Despite its potential, inefficiencies in evidence synthesis and suboptimal adherence\nto quality standards often result in research waste. Systematic reviews are prone to redundancy,\nincomplete reporting, and lack of methodological rigor.\n\nObjectives: We introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven system designed to streamline sys-\ntematic reviews in the BHI domain. The system applies a multipronged approach that includes\nautomated Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study design (PICOS) detection, seman-\ntic search with vector embeddings, graph-based querying of complex relationships, topic modeling\nfor redundancy assessment, and a continuously updated \"living\" database.\n\nMethods: Key components of the system include a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-\nLSTM) model to assess PICOS compliance, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for enhanced semantic retrieval, and BERTopic for thematic clustering.\nGraph-structured data are stored using Neo4j to capture interactions among interventions, outcomes,\nand study designs. Performance was evaluated through comparative analyses of RAG with GPT-\n3.5 versus plain GPT-4, with additional attention to the Bi-LSTM model's accuracy for PICOS\nclassification and a hierarchical study design classifier.\n\nResults: RAG combined with GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4 for specialized BHI queries requiring\ngraph-based and topic-driven insights. The Bi-LSTM model achieved an 87% accuracy in distinguish-\ning PICOS-compliant articles, while the study design classifier attained a 95.7% overall accuracy. By\ndetecting research redundancies, spotlighting underexplored topics, and offering real-time updates,\nthis system systematically reduces waste. Its user-oriented interface provides interactive dashboards\nand conversational AI, supporting dynamic evidence synthesis.\n\nConclusion: This AI-enhanced platform addresses well-known challenges in systematic reviews\nand research waste. Although originally built for BHI, its architectural flexibility incorporating\nadvanced NLP, machine learning, and graph-based analytics-renders it broadly adaptable to various\nbiomedical research fields. By enabling timely and rigorous evidence synthesis, our approach\nfacilitates more efficient research allocations, fosters high-quality methodological standards, and\nsupports informed clinical decision-making.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The Brain-Heart Interconnectome (BHI) explores the intricate bidirectional relationships between the cardiovascular and\nneurological systems [14, 30, 31, 32]. While BHI holds considerable promise for improving patient care, inefficiencies\nin synthesizing evidence, coupled with inconsistent adherence to quality standards, create obstacles for both clinical and\nresearch endeavors. These inefficiencies often give rise to research waste, defined as redundant or low-quality studies\nthat fail to enhance collective knowledge [1, 4, 3, 9].\n\nResearch waste persists at virtually all stages of evidence synthesis. For instance, recent studies show that more\nthan 85% of surgical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exhibit at least one form of research waste-ranging from\ninadequate reporting to non-publication [4]\u2014and comparable shortcomings persist in other areas of biomedical research\n[5]. Such inefficiencies generate a cycle in which researchers, clinicians, and policymakers often lack the most rigorous\nand current data necessary for optimal decisions [33, 34].\n\nMethodological frameworks like PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study design) [27, 28, 29]\npromise improved coherence and replicability in clinical trial design [12, 15, 11]. However, evidence suggests that\nguidelines such as CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) [21] and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting\nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [24] remain inconsistently applied, undermining their full potential.\nIn particular, many systematic review authors report substantial challenges in managing extensive literature searches\nand ensuring meticulous screening and data extraction [8].\n\nThe shortcomings in current processes have prompted increasing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) tools to enhance\nsystematic reviews. Several initiatives integrate AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) methods to expedite\nliterature search, screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias evaluations [19, 10]. Although recent successes such\nas RobotReviewer and SciSpace [16, 17, 18]-indicate that AI can lighten the manual workload, domain-specific\ncustomization and dynamic updating features remain underdeveloped in many of these systems [23]."}, {"title": "1.1 Aim and Scope of the Proposed System", "content": "This paper introduces an AI-driven system designed to systematically enhance evidence synthesis in the BHI domain.\nOur solution incorporates:\n\n\u2022 Automated PICOS Compliance Detection: Prioritizes studies aligned with rigorous methodological stan-\ndards.\n\n\u2022 Semantic Search & Graph-Based Queries: Leverages Neo4j [26] and pgVector to reveal meaningful\nrelational structures among diverse data elements (e.g., outcomes, interventions).\n\n\u2022 Topic Modeling via BERTopic: Identifies core themes, flags redundant clusters, and highlights underexplored\nareas [25].\n\n\u2022 Living Database Functionality: Dynamically integrates new publications into existing systematic reviews,\nensuring near real-time updates.\n\n\u2022 Interactive Dashboards and Conversational AI: Facilitates broad accessibility, enabling clinicians, re-\nsearchers, and other stakeholders to engage with and interpret data more efficiently."}, {"title": "1.2 Overall Workflow in Systematic Reviews", "content": "Aligned with standard systematic review pipelines, the framework features four primary phases (Figure 1):\n\n1.

Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for\nLarge Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually <10) setting and lack\nevaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts.

To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot\nin-context inductive reasoning benchmark that asks LLM to induce output via input-output\nexamples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study\nmany novel problems for inductive reasoning and many-shot ICL, including robustness against\nerroneous shots and the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and acquired insightful findings.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The tremendous success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years [24, 25, 51] has finally brought us\nto the extent where human-level Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) becomes seemingly within reach [25].\nWith such success, researchers have shifted their focus from syntax- and word-level traditional Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity recognition [37, 47], sentiment classification [63, 68]\nand translation [42, 65] onto those which measure abilities once considered unique to humans. Inductive\nReasoning (IR) [20], which is the ability to summarize general high-level rules from existing examples, thus\ncomes into attention [10]; instead of math or coding which require knowledge and experience in particular\nfields, inductive reasoning measures the abstract generalization power of an intelligence [10] and is considered\nas a primal mental ability [30]. Thus, it is long studied by the cognitive science community [6, 21], adopted in\nIQ tests for human [17], and is recently used as a measurement for the state-of-the-art LLMs such as o1 [25]\nto show their intelligence level. While many IR benchmarks [4, 35, 43] for LLMs have been proposed, such as\nARC [10] and its variants [29, 75], they all focused on few-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) with typically <10\nexamples. While induction from fewer examples may imply stronger reasoning ability, some underlying rules\nfor IR problems are inherently too complicated or ambiguous for a few examples. For instance, consider a\nquadratic curve with clipping; with three examples, it is unknown whether the curve is sampled from a circle\nor a quadratic curve, let alone a clipped one; however, with 300 examples, not only the quadratic function is\nclear, but the special clipping rule are also very likely to be retrieved. LLM should handle such long-context,\nmany-example cases as well as few-shot inductive reasoning.\nIn fact, the scaling of the amount of ICL data is in line with the trend of the LLM community striving to\nexpand the context length [53, 66] for super-human problem-solving efficiency. It is with this trend that a\nnew paradigm emerged recently: Many-Shot ICL, which typically uses hundreds to thousands of examples\nfor test-time task learning without using expensive and relatively data-inefficient fine-tuning [1]. However,\nmany-shot evaluations are mostly focused on classifications [5, 38, 39, 84, 86], which is a very limited area for\ninductive reasoning. Other standard long-context LLM tasks, such as needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) [28], are\nmore of a retrieval problem than gathering understanding from many pieces of clues. With all these blanks in\nLLM evaluation (see Tab. 1 for a comparison with the most related benchmarks, and Tab. 4 in Appendix A\nfor a more complete version), we must ask: How to evaluate the LLM's ability to aggregate many pieces of\ninformation from many examples to perform inductive reasoning on various complicated problems?\nTo address the problem above and fix the limitation of existing LLM evaluation from both inductive reasoning\nand the many-shot/long-context community, we propose MIR-Bench, a large and diverse Many-shot Inductive\nReasoning benchmark, in which LLMs are given examples of input-output data generated by an underlying\nunknown function with diverse input-output forms, and need to predict the output for new input.\nThe benchmark is generated by the following pipeline as illustrated in Fig. 1: 1) we collect functions from\nintroductory-level coding benchmarks including HumanEval+ [41], MBPP+ [41] and APPS [22]; 2) we use\nGPT-40-0806 to write code as data generators that produces input-output pairs, and execute them to generate\nICL shots and test input; 3) run ground truth function with generated inputs for ground-truth outputs; 4) use\nscripts to build prompts for target problem, and filter out problems with too long shot length or insufficient\ninput-output diversity. With such procedure, we propose two sets of problems: MIR-Core and MIR-Extended,\nwhich contains 3000 problems (300 functions \u00d7 10 test cases), and 6930 problems (693 functions \u00d7 10 test"}, {"title": "3 MIR-Bench", "content": "In this section, we will introduce our MIR-Bench in details, with Sec. 3.1 discussing the formulation of\nthe problems evaluated in our benchmark and Sec. 3.2 introducing the pipeline with which we build our\nbenchmark."}, {"title": "3.1 Problem Formulation", "content": "The goal of the problems in our benchmark is for LLMs to predict the output for a new input given a list of\nexamples. More specifically, assume we have an underlying function $y = f(x)$, where $x$ and $y$ can be arbitrary\ndata. 1 Assume for $f$ we have a set of $n$ known example input-output pairs $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$, and a\nnew input $x_{new}$; then, the LLMs' input will be $[c_1, str(x_1), str(y_1), str(x_2), str(y_2),...,str(x_n), str(y_n), c_2, x_{new}]$,\nwhere $[.,.,...,]$ is a string concatenation, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are general context prompts (e.g. \u201cYou are an expert in\nreasoning", "Here is the target input": "see Appendix B for details), and $str()$ is the string representation\nplus an \"Input: \" prefix for $x$ and \"Output: \" prefix for $y$. LLMs can output arbitrary rationale; however, they\nmust end their answer with $str(y_{new})$, where $y_{new} = f(x_{new})$. The answer is extracted with rule-based scripts,\nand exact match will be performed to determine the LLM's performance in accuracy. See Appendix B.6 for\ndetails on answer extraction."}, {"title": "3.2 Benchmark Construction", "content": "The construction of our benchmark can be decomposed into four steps: function collection, input generation,\noutput generation, and prompt building.\nFunction collection. We begin by collecting introductory-level coding problems from three coding benchmarks:\nHumaneval+ [41], MBPP+ [41], and APPS [22]. We use the whole Humaneval+ and MBPP+ dataset (164\nand 378 problems respectively); for APPS dataset, we select problems from its training dataset with difficulty\nlevel \u201cintroductory\" (2640 problems). We ensure that each solution code is a single function without wrapping\nsolution class or test statement; for codes in APPS that do not conform to this standard, we ask GPT-40-0806\nto rewrite the code given problem input and the solution code (See Appendix B.3 for prompts).\nInput generation. We use GPT-40-0806 to automatically generate inputs for each function acquired in the\nlast step, for which prior works [40, 59] usually directly generate input data. However, such method is not\nonly non-scalable, but also prone to errors such as input format mismatch. To address this issue, we prompt\nGPT-40-0806 to first generate \u201cdata generators\u201d for each problem (See Appendix B.4 for prompts), then run\neach generator in Python interpreter to generate data. We generate 20000 shots and 10 test cases for each\nproblem, which is impossible to acquire with prior methods. We wrote the prompt such that the test case\nis supposed to be slightly harder (e.g. with larger numbers / longer lists) than the shots. In this step, we\nfilter out problems with the generated input too identical (< 4096 different shots out of 20000), duplicate test\ncases, or test cases appearing in the shots.\nOutput generation. With input generated, we write a script to stitch generated input and ground truth\nfunction $f$ in the same Python script, and run them in the intepreter to acquire ground-truth output. In\nthis step, we filter out problems with floating number output, unless the precision is fixed across all shots by\nrounding, given by input, or unimportant for exact matching (e.g. the function is to output absolute value).\nWe also filter out problems with too low output diversity (no less than 50% of the shots having the same\nanswer), and problems with invalid output due to code error.\nPrompt building. In this step, we use Python scripts to automatically stitch input-output pairs with task\ndescription to generate final input for LLMs. Finally, we also filter out problems that are unsolvable (either\ntoo difficult or data coverage are insufficient) for current state-of-the-art LLMs, which are the problems that\nhave 0 accuracy for all five models {GPT-40-0806, GPT-40-mini-0718, Gemini-Pro 1.5-002, Gemini-Flash\n1.5-002, Mistral-Large-2} across {4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048} shots in 10 test cases. After this\nstep, we have 693 valid functions, each with 10 test cases; these problems are the content of our benchmark\nversion MIR-Extended. Within this version, we select 300 problems that are challenging and can largely\nbenefit from many-shot; See Sec. 4.2 for details."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we will introduce general performance of existing models on our benchmark and a series of\nexploratory experiments which gives novel insights. More specifically, we first introduce the main results\non our MIR-Extended benchmark in Sec. 4.1; then, we explore factors that indicate whether a problem can\nbenefit from many-shot, and build MIR-Core in Sec. 4.2. We further conduct more in-depth analysis on\nimportant properties of LLM's many-shot intelligence in several aspects on MIR-Core in Sec. 4.3, 4.4, 4.5\nand 4.6. For better readability, we defer more empirical ablation and analysis to Appendix D."}, {"title": "4.1 MIR-Extended", "content": "Evaluation setup. We evaluate a set of 15 cutting-edge LLMs with context window > 128K tokens on our\nMIR-Extended benchmark with 693 different function and 10 test cases per function (a total of 6930 problems).\nThe evaluated LLMs are: {ol-preview-0912, o1-mini-0912, GPT-40-0806, GPT-40-mini-0708, Gemini-Pro\n1.5-002, Gemini-Flash 1.5-002, Gemini-Flash 2.0, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Claude-3-Haiku,\nClaude-3-Sonnet, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, Mistral-Large-2, Moonshot-128K, GLM-4-Plus} by invoking official\nAPIs; see Appendix B.1 for detailed prompts. We use greedy decoding (with temperature 0) for evaluation\n(See Appendix D.1 for ablations on the robustness of evaluation), and use exact match accuracy as the metric\nwith rule-based extraction of the answer from LLM's response (See Appendix B.6). Each model is evaluated\nwith {4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048}-shot with shots uniformly randomly sampled from 20000 shots\ngenerated in Sec. 3.2.\nResults. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the performance of all 15 LLMs on our MIR-Extended benchmark. The perfor-\nmance of the LLMs varies greatly; among all models, ol-mini-0912 and o1-preview-0912 clearly outperform\nall other models, followed by Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-40-0806. However, all LLMs evaluated are far\nfrom addressing our inductive reasoning task; the best model, o1-mini-0912, only reaches an accuracy of less\nthan 0.7, while most models such as GPT-40-0806 only achieve less than 0.4 accuracy. Such performance\nindicates that different from the conclusion in Cheng et al. [9], LLMs' inductive reasoning abilities still limited\nin complicated tasks. Claude-3.5-Haiku achieves surprisingly low accuracy; upon checking examples, we find\nthat the model often do not understand our prompt and see the target input as part of an incomplete data,\nthus refusing to answer the problem.\nInterestingly, scaling up the number of shots is not always beneficial, similar to many tasks in Agarwal et al.\n[1]. For models other than Gemini, the performance drop over 512 shots can be partly attributed to exceeding\nthe 128K context limit 2; however, for most language models evaluated (including GPT and ol-mini), the\nperformance growth often stops at no more than 256 shots, where the context limit is not reached. Such\nissue stems from attention dispersion as stated in Yuan et al. [79]; as the number of examples increases, the\nattention weights which should be cast on the most informative shots is distracted by the less informative\nones instead of lack of information retrieval ability. We validate this via ablation in Sec. 4.3."}, {"title": "4.2 MIR-Core: Problems Requiring Many-Shot", "content": "Ablation on possible factors. While we have obtained many inductive reasoning problems, not all of them\nnecessarily benefits from many-shot ICL; for example, a simple function such as adding two numbers or\nabsolute value can be induced in a few shots. To study the inductive reasoning problems whose difficulties are\ndistinctive between few-shot and many-shot, and curate a high-quality many-shot benchmark, we perform a\ndetailed ablation study on possible factors for such distinctiveness. To better study such property, we define\nthe following metric D:\n$D = \\frac{D_1 + D_2}{2}$, where $D_1 = \\frac{acc@64 + acc@128}{2}$\n$D_2 = \\frac{[acc@32 + acc@64+ acc@128]_[acc@4+acc@8+ acc@16]}{3}$,\n(1)"}, {"title": "4.3 Results with Duplicated Few-shots", "content": "To study whether the saturation of many-shot in Sec. 4.1 and 4.2 comes from the inability of retrieving the\nmost useful shots for induction or the inability of aggregating many pieces of different, useful information, we\nconduct an ablation where we test {GPT-40-0806, GPT-4o-mini-0718, Gemini-Pro 1.5-002, Gemini-Flash\n1.5-002, Mistral-Large-2} on MIR-Core with 16-shot, but with the following two settings: 1) one shot duplicated\nuntil total shots number of reach {16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048}, while other 15 shots only appear once;\nand 2) each of the 16 shot reused for {1,2,4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128} times.\nWe ensure the examples in test cases with more shots are supersets of those with less shots, i.e., the information\ngiven in the input is strictly increasing with more shots. The result is shown in Fig. 4, where solid lines\nare for original resutls on MIR-Core from Sec. 4.2, dashed lines are for scenario 1 (one shot duplicate), and\ndotted lines are for scenario 2 (all shots duplicate).When the number of shots increase, as shown in panel (b),\nthe performance difference between normal many-shot and both scenario 1 and 2 increases, which indicates\nthat LLMs can indeed aggregate many pieces of information from more shots and acquire performance gain\n(which is almost not the case for Mistral-Large-2, and thus its \u201csaturation point\" of performance with more\nshots is the lowest). However, the difference diminishes when there are more than 512 shots (note this also\napplies for Gemini with 2M context length, thus this is not a problem of hard context limit). Such result\nindicates that too many pieces of information may actually harm LLMs' performance by distraction. Also,\nthe performance of the dotted line (all shots duplicate) is in general not higher than that of the dashed line\n(one shot duplicate), which indicates that the problem is not in information retrieval as the two scenarios\ncontain the same amount of information but the latter has higher difficulty for information retrieval.

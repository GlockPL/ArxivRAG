This paper delves into the reproduction and evaluation of dialogue summarization models, focusing specifically on the discrepancies observed between original studies and our reproduction efforts. Dialogue summarization is a critical aspect of NLP, aiming to condense conversational content into concise and informative summaries, thus aiding in efficient information retrieval and decision-making processes. Our research involved a thorough examination of several dialogue summarization models using the AMI (Augmented Multi-party Interaction) dataset. The models assessed include Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNet) and various versions of Pointer-Generator Networks (PGN), namely PGN(DKE), PGN(DRD), PGN(DTS), and PGN(DALL). The primary objective was to evaluate the informativeness and quality of the summaries generated by these models through human assessment, a method that introduces subjectivity and variability in the evaluation process. The analysis began with Dataset 1, where the sample standard deviation of 0.656 indicated a moderate dispersion of data points around the mean.\nIn our reproduction experiment, the scores were overall inferior to those in the original study, mostly all below 3.0 versus the original scores, which were all above 3.0.

Dialogue summarization is the process of condensing conversational content into concise, informative summaries. This capability is crucial for a wide range of applications, including customer service, meeting minutes, and information retrieval, where users need to quickly grasp the essential points from lengthy discussions. Despite the progress, the challenge of accurately summarizing dialogues remains significant due to the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of human conversations. Human conversations are intricate, involving multiple participants, varying topics, and numerous interruptions and overlaps. Unlike monologues or structured texts, dialogues are often informal and unstructured, making it challenging for summarization models to capture the essence effectively. The need for effective dialogue summarization tools is underscored by the increasing volume of conversational data generated across various domains, from business meetings to social media interactions. Automating the summarization process can save time and effort, improve information dissemination, and enhance decision-making processes. Several challenges characterize the task of dialogue summarization:\n\u2022\tComplexity and Dynamics: Dialogues are inherently more complex than monologues. They involve interactions among multiple speakers, leading to frequent topic shifts, interruptions, and overlapping speech, which complicates the summarization process.\n\u2022\tInformality and Ambiguity: Human conversations often include informal language, slang, and colloquialisms. Additionally, participants may leave sentences unfinished, use ambiguous references, or assume shared knowledge, making it difficult for models to generate accurate summaries.\n\u2022\tRelevance and Redundancy: Identifying the most relevant information and avoiding redundancy are critical in summarization. In dialogues, important points can be dispersed throughout the conversation, requiring the model to effectively filter and condense the content without losing essential information.\n\u2022\tEvaluation Metrics: Evaluating the quality of generated summaries is another challenge. Traditional metrics used for text summarization may not fully capture the nuances of dialogue summarization. Human evaluation, while insightful, introduces subjectivity and variability, necessitating more robust and standardized evaluation methods.\nThis study aims to address these challenges by reproducing and evaluating dialogue summarization models through human assessment. The focus is on assessing the informativeness and quality of summaries generated by different models using the AMI (Augmented Multi-party Interaction) dataset.\nThe specific objectives include:\n\u2022\tReproduction of Existing Studies: To reproduce the results of existing studies on dialogue summarization models, particularly those involving Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNet) and Pointer-Generator Networks (PGN), to validate their findings.\n\u2022\tEvaluation of Model Performance: To evaluate the performance of these models in generating informative and high-quality summaries through human assessment, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each model.\n\u2022\tAnalysis of Variability and Consistency: To analyze the variability and consistency in human evaluations, exploring the factors that contribute to discrepancies in the assessment of dialogue summaries.\nOur approach involves a systematic reproduction of existing studies on dialogue summarization models, followed by a thorough evaluation of the generated summaries. The key steps in our methodology include:\n\u2022\tDataset Selection: The AMI dataset, which consists of multi-party meeting recordings, was chosen for this study. This dataset provides a rich source of conversational data with varying levels of complexity and formality, making it ideal for evaluating dialogue summarization models.\n\u2022\tModel Implementation: Several dialogue summarization models were implemented, including HMNet and various versions of PGN (PGN(DKE), PGN(DRD), PGN(DTS), and PGN(DALL)). These models represent different approaches to capturing and condensing dialogue content.\n\u2022\tHuman Evaluation: The generated summaries were evaluated by human annotators based on criteria such as informativeness, coherence, and conciseness. Inter-annotator agreement was measured to assess the consistency of evaluations.\n\u2022\tStatistical Analysis: Statistical measures, including sample standard deviation and confidence intervals, were used to analyze the dispersion and variability of data points. The coefficient of variation was calculated to compare the relative variability across different models.\nThe discrepancies observed in our reproduction study underscore the inherent complexity of dialogue summarization and the variability in human assessments. These findings provide"}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "The task of dialogue summarization has garnered significant attention within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to the increasing volume of conversational data and the necessity for efficient information retrieval from such data. This section reviews the progress made in dialogue summarization, discussing various approaches, datasets, evaluation methods, and the challenges faced by researchers.\nExtractive vs. Abstractive Methods\nDialogue summarization methods can be broadly categorized into extractive and abstractive approaches. Extractive methods select and concatenate fragments of the original dialogue to form a summary, while abstractive methods generate new sentences that capture the essence of the dialogue. Early research focused on extractive techniques due to their simplicity and robustness. Techniques such as TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004) and graph-based methods have been employed to identify key sentences from dialogues. These methods typically rely on features like sentence position, length, and keyword frequency to determine the importance of sentences. More recent advancements have shifted towards abstractive methods, leveraging the power of deep learning and sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. Models like Pointer-Generator Networks (See et al., 2017) and Hierarchical Attention Networks (Yang et al., 2016) have been adapted for dialogue summarization. These models are capable of generating more coherent and contextually relevant summaries by understanding the broader context of the conversation. The advent of neural network architectures, particularly transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), has revolutionized dialogue summarization. Transformer-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018) have been fine-tuned for summarization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.\nNotable Studies and Contributions\nSee et al. (2017): The introduction of Pointer-Generator Networks marked a significant advancement in abstractive summarization, allowing models to switch between generating new words and copying from the source text. This approach has been widely adopted and adapted for dialogue summarization."}, {"title": "PROPOSED WORK", "content": "This study aims to reproduce and critically evaluate existing dialogue summarization models using a structured and comprehensive approach. The proposed work will involve several phases, including data collection, model implementation, performance evaluation, and analysis. The foundation of this research lies in utilizing robust and diverse datasets for training and evaluating dialogue summarization models. We aim to ensure proper preprocessing of these datasets to maintain consistency and reliability. One of the datasets we will use is the AMI Meeting Corpus, which contains recordings and transcripts of multi-party meetings, offering a rich source of conversational data. Another dataset, the ICSI Meeting Corpus, provides additional diversity and complexity to our dataset pool. Additionally, the SAMSum Corpus, consisting of dialogues from messaging platforms, allows us to include informal and concise conversations typical of text-based communication.\nData preprocessing is crucial to ensure the quality of input for our models. We will start by cleaning up transcriptions, removing non-verbal cues, filler words, and background noise to focus on the dialogue content. Proper speaker attribution will be maintained to preserve the conversational flow and context. Tokenization will then be applied to segment the dialogues appropriately for input into neural network models while preserving sentence boundaries and dialogue structure.

The Hierarchical Memory Networks (HMNet) and several Pointer-Generator Network (PGN) variants (PGN(DKE), PGN(DRD), PGN(DTS), PGN(DALL)) were tested on the AMI dataset. Our reproduction efforts yielded inferior results compared to the original studies, where the scores across all PGN variants were consistently lower than 3.0, while the original study reported scores above 3.0. Specifically, the gold-standard summaries produced by our experiments did not align well with the baseline metrics observed in the original research by Feng et al. (2021). We noted that HMNet did not exhibit the expected performance gains over the PGN models, a finding that contrasts sharply with earlier research. The statistical analysis, including the sample standard deviation of 0.656, pointed to moderate variability in our evaluation results, highlighting inconsistencies between human annotators. These variations were particularly evident in the informativeness scores, which were lower than anticipated, indicating potential issues with either the model's training or the dataset's suitability for human-based evaluation.\nThe findings in our reproduction efforts bring to light several important factors regarding dialogue summarization models. First, the noticeable drop in performance from the original study could be attributed to the variability inherent in human evaluation processes, dataset selection, and model implementation details that were not explicitly replicated in our study. The AMI dataset's characteristics, such as the complexity and multi-party nature of the dialogues, may have posed additional challenges for the models, leading to a drop in informativeness and coherence scores during human assessment.\nThe observed lack of performance improvement for HMNet relative to PGN variants also suggests that hierarchical memory mechanisms might not be as effective for summarizing highly unstructured and dynamic dialogues. This brings into question whether the AMI dataset, commonly used for such tasks, is an ideal benchmark for dialogue summarization. The variability in human assessments also underscores the importance of employing standardized, automated metrics for benchmarking while reducing reliance on subjective evaluations, which can introduce biases and inconsistencies. Moreover, the gap between our"}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "In summary, our systematic exploration of dialogue summarization models, particularly HMNet and Pointer-Generator Networks, highlighted key challenges in reproducing existing findings.

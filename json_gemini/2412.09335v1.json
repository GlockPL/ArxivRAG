{"title": "Does Low Spoilage Under Cold Conditions Foster Cultural Complexity During the Foraging Era?\nA Theoretical and Computational Inquiry", "authors": ["Minhyeok Lee"], "abstract": "Human cultural complexity did not arise in a vacuum. Scholars in the humanities\nand social sciences have long debated how ecological factors, such as climate and re-\nsource availability, enabled early hunter-gatherers to allocate time and energy beyond\nbasic subsistence tasks. This paper presents a formal, interdisciplinary approach that\nintegrates theoretical modeling with computational methods to examine whether con-\nditions that allow lower spoilage of stored food, often associated with colder climates\nand abundant large fauna, could indirectly foster the emergence of cultural complexity.\nOur contribution is twofold. First, we propose a mathematical framework that relates\nspoilage rates, yield levels, resource management skills, and cultural activities. Under\nthis framework, we prove that lower spoilage and adequate yields reduce the frequency\nof hunting, thus freeing substantial time for cultural pursuits. Second, we implement\na reinforcement learning simulation, inspired by engineering optimization techniques,\nto validate the theoretical predictions. By training agents in different (Y, p) environ-\nments, where Y is yield and p is the probability of daily spoilage, we observe patterns\nconsistent with the theoretical model: stable conditions with lower spoilage strongly\ncorrelate with increased cultural complexity. While we do not claim to replicate prehis-\ntoric social realities directly, our results suggest that ecologically stable niches provided\na milieu in which cultural forms could germinate and evolve. This study, therefore,\noffers an integrative perspective that unites humanistic inquiries into the origins of\nculture with the formal rigor and exploratory power of computational modeling.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The origin and early expansion of human cultural complexity have occupied a central place in\ndebates among archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians of prehistory. Since the early\ntwentieth century, scholars have recognized that certain ecological conditions might have cre-\nated more opportunities for artistic, symbolic, and social innovation. Yet, these arguments\noften relied on speculative, albeit insightful, narratives rather than robust theoretical or com-\nputational foundations. With the advent of more nuanced analytical tools, recent scholarship\nhas begun to rigorously test the links between environmental stability, resource availability,\nand cultural development. By leveraging computational modeling alongside ethnographic\nand archaeological data, contemporary research aims to understand not just the presence of\nsymbolic artifacts or social institutions, but also the underlying ecological and technological\npreconditions that may have nurtured these cultural forms.\nIn recent decades, numerous interdisciplinary studies have aimed to elucidate the relation-\nships between climate, subsistence strategies, and cultural development (see, for instance,\nBurdukiewicz [2014], Chase [1994], Sterelny [2021], LL [2013], Wollstonecroft [2011], Bradley\n[2014], Cook [2020]). Many of these works are derived from the long-standing hypothesis\nthat colder climates, offering large mammals as stable, high-calorie resources, could reduce\nthe frequency of hunting events needed to sustain a community. In turn, fewer hunting\nevents might create windows of leisure time. This additional time, no longer spent merely\nensuring survival, could be invested in the production of symbolic objects, the performance\nof rituals, the refinement of storage methods, and the reinforcement of social bonds. Scholars\nhave suggested that even subtle differences in the spoilage rates of stored food can shape\nthe long-term evolutionary trajectory of societies, as lower spoilage reduces uncertainty and\nallows the accumulation of surplus food (see also Clark et al. [2022], Apicella et al. [2012]).\nHowever, existing narratives often treat technological and social management strategies\nas static or secondary. The complexity of social cooperation, the refinement of food preser-\nvation techniques, and the sophistication of storage containers and shelters are frequently\nacknowledged only as afterthoughts, rather than integral parts of the environmental-human\nnexus. Indeed, much earlier scholarship tended to regard \"culture\" as a byproduct of envi-\nronmental abundance, rather than as an interactive and co-evolving component of the sub-\nsistence system itself. More recent discussions, influenced by theoretical and methodological\nadvances in archaeology and cultural evolution studies, have emphasized that \u201cculture\u201d and\n\u201cenvironment\u201d are mutually constitutive. In other words, as resource management skills\n(such as improved storage techniques, effective preservation methods, or knowledge of sea-\nsonal resource distribution) develop, they not only mitigate spoilage and improve yields, but\nalso reshape ecological constraints themselves (cf. Kelly [2013], Richerson and Boyd [2008],\nHenrich [2016], Zeder [2012], Smith [2011]).\nThis study aims to situate itself at the intersection of these debates by offering a refined\nmathematical model coupled with a computational simulation. The core question guiding\nthis research is: Does environmental stability, characterized by lower spoilage probability and\nhigher yields, indirectly foster conditions more conducive to cultural complexity? Our hy-\npothesis does not rely on simple deterministic claims. Rather, we posit that, under certain\nassumptions, a group operating in a stable environment is likely to experience fewer con-\nstraints in food acquisition and preservation, thus freeing up valuable time. This additional\ntime can then be allocated to cultural pursuits, be they artistic, ritualistic, or technological\nin nature. Over repeated generations, even modest reductions in spoilage or slight increases\nin yield can be amplified through feedback loops, allowing cultural complexity to take root\nand flourish.\nTo explore this hypothesis, we propose a formal model that captures the essential vari-\nables: yield, spoilage, resource management skill, and cultural complexity. We introduce"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "We consider a simplified ecological model in which a human group inhabits an environment\ncharacterized by two key parameters: daily yield Y > 0 from hunted fauna and daily spoilage\nprobability p\u2208 [0,1] that reduces stored food each day. The group requires a fixed annual\namount of food F > 0 and must allocate its time to hunting, investing in resource manage-\nment skills, or engaging in cultural activities. Time is discretized into daily units on a fixed\nhorizon T days.\nAssumption 1 (Basic Requirements). The group must secure a total amount of food F over\nT days. Each day, a fixed daily consumption c > 0 is subtracted from stored food. If the\nstored food becomes negative, the group suffers a starvation penalty.\nAssumption 2 (Actions). On each day, the group selects one of the following actions:\n1. Hunt: Costs $d_h > 0$ days (e.g., $d_h = 2$). The group consumes daily rations during\nthese days. After completing the hunt, they obtain an effective yield proportional to Y,\nadjusted by the group's management skill G and cultural complexity C. The effective\nyield is:\n$eff(Y, G, C) = Y (1 + 0.1G) (1 + 0.01C)$.\n2. Invest (Resource Management): Costs $d_I = 1$ day. Improves G by a fixed incre-\nment \u2206G > 0.\n3. Culture: Costs $d_c = 1$ day. Increases C by a unit and grants a small immediate\nreward.\nAssumption 3 (Daily Spoilage). At the end of each day, the stored food is reduced by a\nspoilage factor p\u2208 [0,1]. If $f_{current}$ denotes current food, then:\n$f_{next} = (f_{current} \u2013 c)(1 \u2013 p)$.\nIf $f_{next} < 0$, the group incurs a large penalty and the process ends prematurely.\nAssumption 4 (Initial Conditions and Ending). Initially, the group starts with a small\npositive amount of food (e.g., enough for several days). After T days, the episode ends. We\nconsider that no final additional reward is given, except that the final cultural complexity\nC itself is recorded as a measure of success. Thus, the objective is to maximize C without\nstarving."}, {"title": "Propositions and Theorem", "content": "The following propositions formalize how lower spoilage (p) and higher yield (Y) affect time\nallocation and cultural complexity C. Lower p implies that each hunted food unit remains\navailable longer. Similarly, a larger Y per hunt reduces the required hunting frequency.\nAssumption 5 (Comparative Conditions). Consider two environments A and B. In A, we\nhave a higher yield $Y_A > Y_B$ and lower spoilage $p_A < p_B$. Both groups require F units of\nfood annually and have access to the same actions.\nProposition 1. Under the given assumptions, the environment A requires fewer hunts to\nachieve the annual requirement F due to $Y_A > Y_B$ and a lower effective daily spoilage.\nProof. If the hunt yield is higher and the spoilage is lower, the effective retained food per\nhunt in A is strictly greater than in B. Hence, to obtain F, fewer hunts are necessary in A.\nThus, $H_A < H_B$, where H\u00a1 is the number of hunts in the environment i.\nProposition 2. Because fewer hunts are required in A, the group in A allocates fewer total\ndays to hunting, resulting in more spare days available for either cultural activities or resource\nmanagement.\nProof. If $H_A < H_B$ and each hunt costs at least $d_h$ days, then the total hunting time\n$T_{hunt,A} < T_{hunt,B}$. Since T is fixed, $T_{free,A} = T - T_{hunt,A} > T - T_{hunt,B} = T_{free,B}$\u00b7\nTheorem 1 (Cultural Complexity Advantage). Let $C_i$ denote the cultural complexity achieved\nin environment i. If $H_A < H_B$ and the environment A invest the extra free time in cultural\nactions, then $C_A > C_B$. Furthermore, since a higher C increases the future hunting efficiency\nthrough (1 + 0.01C), environment A experiences a strengthening cycle that further elevates\ncultural complexity.\nProof. By Proposition 2, environment A has strictly more free days to allocate. Culture\naction increases C by one unit per day and provides immediate rewards. Given that A can\nafford more cultural actions (due to less frequent hunting), $C_A > C_B$. This increment in C\nloops back to improve effective yield in future hunts, reinforcing the cycle and maintaining\nor increasing the gap.\nThe theorem shows that under lower spoilage and higher yield conditions, groups can\nminimize the hunting frequency, thereby freeing up time for cultural activities. This leads\nto an emergent advantage in cultural complexity."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "We conduct a computational experiment using a RL framework.

This idea resonates with several strands of research in archaeology,\nanthropology, and cultural evolution.\nNumerous studies have addressed the relationship between stable resource bases and cul-\ntural elaboration. For example, Gamble [2007] discusses how consistent resource availability\nin Pleistocene Europe could have facilitated symbolic behavior, while Mithen [1997] explores\nhow cognitive fluidity and symbolic thought might have emerged when subsistence pres-\nsures diminished. Similarly, Richerson and Boyd [2008] emphasizes how cultural capacities\ncan expand when ecological constraints are relaxed, and Shennan [2009] links variation in\nsubsistence strategies to the complexity of material culture.\nIn our model, the lower p reduces the need for constant hunting, mirroring the arguments\nthat stable conditions free humans from perpetual resource pursuit, allowing them to invest\nin activities unrelated to immediate survival. Authors such as Klein [2009] and d'Errico and\nHenshilwood [2011] have noted that symbolic artifacts, ritual practices, and social coopera-\ntion intensify when groups face fewer environmental risks. Our computational results lend\nquantitative support to these claims. While these simulations do not replicate actual human\nprehistory, they suggest a plausible mechanism by which environmental parameters shape\nthe space of possible cultural outcomes.\nAnother line of research, represented by works like Boyd and Richerson [1988] and Hen-\nrich [2016], highlights that cumulative cultural evolution thrives under conditions where\nknowledge transmission is reliable and long-term planning is possible. Our simulation shows\nthat when daily spoilage is less severe, agents can plan beyond mere survival. This shift\nenables them to develop resource management (G) and engage in cultural activities (C) that\nwould be impossible under harsher conditions. The model indicates that as groups improve\ntheir resource management skills, the returns on hunting days improve, reinforcing the cycle\nof cultural investment. This insight echoes Laland [2017] and Maryanski [2013], who argue\nthat material and social factors co-evolve, each facilitating the complexity of the other.\nFurthermore, our results link environmental constraints to the trajectories of cultural\ncomplexity in a manner consistent with Powell et al. [2009], who proposed that demographic\nand ecological factors together shape the rates of cultural innovation. In stable, low-spoilage\nenvironments, agents have fewer hunts, more time to learn and transmit skills, and greater\nopportunities to invest in non-survival activities. Although we do not model demographic\nfactors directly, the pattern of improved cultural complexity in stable environments suggests\nthat demographic expansions could further enhance these effects, as larger group sizes may\nsustain more complex cultural repertoires.\nWhile our approach is abstract, the implications resonate with arguments about envi-\nronmental influences on cultural emergence. Historical societies that managed to store and\npreserve food, such as those discussed by Wrangham [2009] and Prentice [2009], often saw in-\ncreases in social complexity and specialization. The emphasis of our model on daily spoilage\ncaptures a simplified version of these preservation challenges. When preservation is easier,\nas represented by lower p, agents can afford to experiment with cultural activities.\nIt is important to note that we do not claim that cold climates or stable ecosystems\ndirectly caused cultural complexity. Rather, we suggest that such conditions reduce the\ntime spent on basic subsistence and thus create opportunities for cultural elaboration. The\nnotion that the environment sets the stage, rather than determines the script, is aligned with\nthe work of Clarke [1978] and Bettinger et al. [2015], who stress that the environment pro-\nvides constraints and opportunities that societies navigate through cultural and technological\nstrategies."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "The emergence of cultural complexity in prehistoric foraging societies remains a central\nquestion in the humanities, prompting inquiries that span archaeology, anthropology, and\nbeyond. These investigations have often highlighted the potential significance of environ-\nmental stability, including factors such as resource predictability and reduced spoilage, as\nenabling conditions that opened the temporal and cognitive space for symbolic, ritualistic,\nand technological innovation.\nOur study contributes to these discussions by providing a formal and computationally\nsupported model that captures the interplay between yield, spoilage, subsistence labor, and\ncultural investment. By demonstrating a quantitative link between ecological parameters\nand cultural outcomes, this work does not assert a deterministic cause-and-effect scenario.\nInstead, it proposes that certain ecological settings created more favorable grounds for cul-\ntural elaboration. These settings, characterized by relatively stable conditions, allowed hu-\nman groups to invest fewer days in securing immediate sustenance and more days in pursuits\nthat, over time, contributed to cultural complexity.\nThis approach resonates with long-standing debates in the humanities, where scholars\nhave argued that cultural forms emerge not merely as epiphenomena of abundance, but as\nadaptive and co-evolving strategies shaped by environmental constraints. Our findings offer\na structured, testable hypothesis: that lower spoilage probabilities and moderately increased\nyields are not just background variables but essential components that shape the tempo\nand mode of cultural evolution. Through computational simulations and theoretical proofs,\nwe have illustrated how groups inhabiting environments with certain ecological parameters\ncould, in principle, shift their time budgets away from relentless foraging toward activities\nthat nurture symbolic behavior, technological refinement, and social cooperation.\nIn acknowledging these patterns, we do not discount other vital factors, social hierarchy,\ncognitive development, language complexity, demographic processes, or the role of migration\nand intergroup exchange. Rather, we present one segment of a larger tapestry in which envi-\nronmental stability stands out as a significant, if indirect, determinant of cultural flourishing.\nFuture research can extend this model to incorporate dynamic ecological cycles, fluctuating\nresource patterns, and culturally transmitted practices. Such integration would further align\ncomputational modeling with the rich empirical record of the humanities, potentially reveal-\ning deeper insights into how and why human culture assumed its remarkable diversity and\ncomplexity over the long arc of prehistory."}]}

However, several domain specific challenges have held back adoption of recommender systems in news publishing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ekstra Bladet News Recommendation Dataset (EB-NeRD). The dataset encompasses data from over a million unique users and more than 37 million impression logs from Ekstra Bladet. It also includes a collection of over 125,000 Danish news articles, complete with titles, abstracts, bodies, and metadata, such as categories. EB-NeRD served as the benchmark dataset for the RecSys '24 Challenge, where it was demonstrated how the dataset can be used to address both technical and normative challenges in designing effective and responsible recommender systems for news publishing. The dataset is available at: https://recsys.eb.dk.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Recommender systems (RS) have become an integral component of the web and are central to producing massive commercial value gains in e-commerce (e.g., Amazon), social media (e.g., Meta), entertainment media (e.g., Netflix and Spotify), and online advertising (e.g., Google and Criteo) [17]. However, even though recommender systems have also been adopted by news publishers [26], several domain-specific 1) technical and 2) normative challenges have held back adoption at scale in the news publishing domain.\nWu et al. [44] recently highlighted several technical challenges (1) in the news recommendation scenario in a call for further research on RS in news. Firstly, news articles are published in a continuous flow, and they tend to expire quickly, resulting in a severe cold-start problem [5]. Classic recommender systems, such as collaborative filtering (CF) [23] or factorization machines (FM) [32], which have been successfully adapted in other fields, are therefore not very applicable. Secondly, explicit user ratings for news articles are rarely found on news platforms, necessitating modeling users' ever-changing news interests based on implicit feedback alone, i.e., based on their browsing behavior [15]. Thirdly, effective RS for news must leverage textual information from news articles [22].\nIn recent years, attempts have been made to address these challenges by developing and testing recommender systems designed specifically for the news domain [6, 19, 31]. Most significantly, Wu et al. [47] identified recommender systems that effectively addressed some of the challenges while demonstrating strong performance on the MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND), a dataset containing news consumption data from the major news aggregator MSN News\u00b9. However, most news recommendation datasets are not public and are tailored to specific use cases, possibly limiting the applicability of the derived models when introduced to different contexts or broader applications. For instance, it is unclear whether"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "2.1 News Recommendations\nNews recommendation systems are designed to enhance the news reading experience by alleviating information overload and presenting users with a personalized selection of articles from a vast catalog. Typically, this involves ranking a set of news articles, or-dering them from most to least likely to be clicked by the user. To achieve this, various sources of data can be leveraged, including the user's click history, session details (such as time and device), user metadata (such as age), and the content of the news articles. Research in news recommendation has primarily focused on ad-dressing two key challenges: 1) representing the raw text found in news articles, and 2) accounting for the dynamic nature of the the user's news interest [3, 36, 42, 43].\nCollaborative filtering has been less commonly applied in news recommendation due to the severe cold-start problem - by the time sufficient behavioral data is collected from users, the rele-vance of news articles has already decayed [31, 47]. Consequently, early research in news recommendation predominantly focused on content-based methods which aspire to generate personalized user profiles that are based on the metadata extracted from the latest news they have read; for example, using keywords [28], topic"}, {"title": "2.2 Existing Datasets", "content": "Personalized news recommendation presents both intriguing re-search challenges and significant practical benefits. However, most research in this area is conducted on proprietary datasets that are not publicly available, such as MSN News [3, 42, 45], Sina News [10], and Twitter [1]. In contrast, only a few publicly available news recommendation datasets exist [11, 21, 27, 47].\nCurrently, the datasets most akin to EB-NeRD are Adressa [11] and MIND [47]. A summary of these datasets can be found in Ta-ble 1. The Microsoft News Dataset (MIND) was released by Wu et al. [47]. Microsoft, a major news aggregator, sourced content from a multitude of news publishers for this dataset. It showcases interac-tions from a 1 million users across 161,013 English news articles, accumulating a total of 24,155,470 clicks. The Adressa dataset, put forth by Gulla et al. [11], offers insights from the Adresseavisen website, a Norwegian digital news publisher. Over a span of ten weeks, this dataset contains interactions of 3.08 million users with 48,486 Norwegian news articles, and 27.22 million clicks.\nWhile all of the datasets offer a range of features, there are clear distinctions between them. Each dataset provides essential news-related information, capturing elements like the title, category, and entities. Although MIND includes the body feature, it is not available in the public version of the dataset. Instead, users must scrape the body content. Even though Wu et al. [47] provides a helpful script for this task, some URLs have expired and are no longer accessible, raising concerns about the long-term availability of this feature. In contrast, EB-NeRD distinguishes itself by offering the title, abstract, and body of articles directly in the public version of the dataset.\nIn terms of non-textual features, MIND is notably limited, provid-ing only user-ID, article-ID, and event-time. Adressa and EB-NeRD, however, present a richer set of features, including read-time, loca-tion, and even the user's subscription status. Another limitation of MIND is that it only tracks front-page events, while both Adressa and EB-NeRD capture user activity more comprehensively, includ-ing interactions on both the front page and on article pages. Addi-tionally, the origin of the data further differentiates these datasets. MIND gathers its data from a news aggregator, whereas both EB-NeRD and Adressa are based on data sourced directly from news publishers. Given the unique patterns exhibited by different news providers and the cultural nuances that influence news consump-tion across countries, we believe that a high-quality, low-resource language news recommendation dataset like EB-NeRD holds signif-icant value for the news recommendation community.

The dataset was collected from the impression logs of active users at Ekstra Bladet\u00b2 over a 6-week period from April 27 to June 8, 2023. Active users were defined as those who had at least 5, but no more than 1,000, news clicks during a 3-week period from May 18 to June 8, 2023. The lower threshold ensures that users had a minimum level of engagement, while the upper threshold helps exclude abnormal activity. To protect user privacy, each user was decoupled from the production system and securely hashed into an anonymized ID using one-time salt hashing [33].\nEach impression log records the news articles viewed by a user during a visit at a specific time, which have been shuffled to remove positional bias, along with the articles that were clicked.

Hence, whereas the RecSys '24 challenge focused on evaluating the whole solution (e.g., the ensemble), we will isolate the individual ensemble components and evaluate the performance of the individual recommender systems and how they may influence a news flow. We will briefly intro-duce the teams and their methods. Although teams may have used the same models or frameworks, their data pipelines and feature engineering approaches varied."}, {"title": "3.2 Ranking", "content": "The primary objective of the RecSys '24 Challenge followed a tradi-tional recommendation setup [47], where participants were tasked with ranking a set of articles from most to least likely for a user to click on, using various data points such as the user's click history, session details, user metadata, and the content of the articles for each impression. The ranked articles were then compared to the actual user clicks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the recommen-dations in terms of ranking standard metrics were used, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) up to position K, denoted @K [44, 47].\n3.2.1 Analysis. Table 3 presents the results for the ranking task. A notable observation is the presence of popularity bias: both the Clicks (59.70) and Read-time (59.40) baselines significantly outper-form the Random baseline (49.98). These baselines provide strong benchmarks for model performance. For instance, the NRMS model only slightly surpasses the strategy of predicting the most popular articles. Additionally, although both teams :D and BlackPearl im-plemented GBDT using CatBoost, their performances differ. This variation is not surprising, as each team has its own data pipeline and approach to feature engineering."}, {"title": "3.3 Beyond-Accuracy", "content": "When implemented at scale, news recommender systems will play a decisive role in organizing the news that readers are exposed to"}, {"title": "4 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we present EB-NeRD, a large-scale dataset for news recommendation, constructed from the user behavior logs of Ek-stra Bladet.

We have open-sourced this comprehensive dataset to facilitate and encourage research on both the technical and normative challenges associated with recommender systems in news publishing. The dataset is intended to serve as a foundation for advanced research in these areas. While we anticipate innova-tive applications of the dataset, we propose that at least three lines of inquiry will be particularly valuable and contribute significantly to ongoing research efforts."}]}

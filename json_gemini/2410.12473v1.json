Traditional prediction methods based on historical data have their limits in forecasting, but recent advancements in natural language processing bring new possibilities for event-based analysis. In particular, Language Models (LM) and their advancement, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), have shown potential in classifying vast amounts of natural language. However, these LMs often have difficulty with domain-specific terminology, limiting their effectiveness in the crude oil sector. Addressing this gap, we introduce CrudeBERT, a fine-tuned LM specifically for the crude oil market. The results indicate that CrudeBERT's sentiment scores align more closely with the WTI Futures curve and significantly enhance price predictions, underscoring the crucial role of integrating economic principles into LMs.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Crude oil plays a key role as both a primary energy source and raw material and serves as a fundamental indicator for the global economic landscape, whether in a boom or recession. Given the finite characteristics of crude oil as a natural resource, its price is expected to be influenced by its availability which is generally driven by the dynamics of supply and demand. However, the literature notes that the availability of crude oil is exposed to highly volatile factors such as economic cycles, geopolitical disturbances, and natural disasters [6]. To address this uncertainty, decision-makers and analysts traditionally utilized technical analysis of structured market data. Yet, this approach has serious limitations due to its dependence on historical data, which often fail to offer significant predictive"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Crude oil greatly impacts the global economy, making its availability and supply chain a topic of extensive research and analysis. Numerous scholarly articles have been written on the subject, exploring various analytical methods, including technical analysis and fundamental assessments, to forecast crude oil prices. This literature review focuses on studies incorporating sentiment-related factors of news to estimate changes in supply and demand to ultimately predict crude oil prices. To achieve this goal, this chapter first examines the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

Furthermore, it explores the use of"}, {"title": "2.1 Market Efficiency and the Role of Sentiment Analysis", "content": "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a foundational concept in finance that investigates the influence of both public and non-public information on the predictability of financial markets. Eugene Fama categorizes EMH into three forms: weak, semi-strong, and strong [10]. The weak form believes prices are driven exclusively by historical data, discounting the effect of external information sources such as news articles or social media. In contrast, the semi-strong form incorporates both historical prices and public data, suggesting that only non-public insights like insider details can allow forecasting [26]. The strong form encompasses historical, public, and confidential data, arguing that any information-based analysis cannot yield consistently higher returns.\nHowever, studies such as that by Qian and Rasheed demonstrate the viability of technical analysis of price fluctuations which were able to deliver predictive accuracies of over 50% [32]. Similarly, the findings by Gu indicate that relying on historical price-based approaches with deep learning may surpass the performance of sentiment-based indicators [11]. However, Hu's study points out the limited presence of modern sentiment-based analysis in leading journals [14]. The significance of news media grew substantially during the pandemic, as demonstrated in a study analyzing social media to grasp shifts in public behavior [22] including sentiment analysis of news media [4]. This perspective aligns with the findings of Mahata et al., especially after the early 2020 pandemic market crash, about the potential inefficacy of existing models based on historical data in the current markets [25]. During this period, the pandemic's effects and the subsequent vaccine releases caused big changes in consumer sentiment and stock prices. Thus, contemporary price prediction models aim to adopt various methods including news analytics [33]. In terms of structuring news to be used with other tabular data, sentiment analysis is considered a prevalent classification task. It aims to categorize affective and subjective information within entire documents, paragraphs, and sentences."}, {"title": "2.2 Evolution of Sentiment Analysis in Finance", "content": "Effectively interpreting the sentiment of news data streams is challenging due to their textual and unstructured character. While sentiment can encompass a wide range of emotions, financial literature often simplifies it into binary polarities to directly analyze market trends [19]. One of the earliest methods for financial sentiment analysis (FSA) in natural language was the Bag-of-Words (BOW) approach developed in the 1980s, which is also known as the lexicon-based method [21]. In this methodology, the overall sentiment of a text is determined by summing up the sentiment scores of both positive and negative words."}, {"title": "2.3 The Advent of the Attention Mechanism and Transformers", "content": "Advancements in neural network architectures have been instrumental in shaping the trajectory of contextualized word embeddings, also known as language models (LMs).

This realization gave rise to Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), one of the first LMs, which has demonstrated high adaptability across diverse NLP tasks and an unparalleled ability for contextual interpretation of words [42]. BERT was developed in two configurations: the smaller version, BERT-base, with 110 million parameters, and its larger counterpart, BERT-large, with 340 million parameters [9].\nAlthough initial training for LMs was predominantly based on generalized resources such as English Wikipedia and the BookCorpus, it became evident"}, {"title": "2.5 The Emergence of Large Language Models", "content": "With the solid foundation established by transformers and their offspring LMs, research interests naturally gravitated towards developing models of even larger scale and complexity.

It's a sophisticated index that uses a vast amount of lexica, annotated by experts, to measure the sentiment of news. The ESS can vary between -1 (negative sentiment) and 1 (positive sentiment) to capture the mood of news. The ESS is designed to recognize various sentiment signals found in financial news. It can assess the sentiment of different events, from company earnings to natural disasters, tailored to specific assets [12]. For our study, the ESS was chosen as an additional benchmark for comparison.\nFinBERT FinBERT was built upon the BERT model and is one of the pioneering language models for financial news. Unlike social media, news media are less likely to contain sarcasm, grammatical errors, or slang. Thus, FinBERT adapts the domain of BERT by performing additional training on a portion of Reuters' TRC2, containing 1.8M news articles published between 2008 and 2010. For sentiment classification, FinBERT was trained on the Financial PhraseBank, which consists of 4845 English sentences randomly selected from the LexisNexis financial news database. These sentences were then annotated by 16 experts from the finance and business fields. When given an input, it provides a granular sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment).\nGPT-3.5 Within the realm of LLMs, GPT-3.5 stands as a state-of-the-art language model, renowned for its diverse application capabilities. It excels in generating coherent and contextually relevant text across various domains.

By normalizing sentiment data over a sliding window we account for the EMH (i.e., the market price reflects all publicly available information) by assuming that only new information that causes a change in expectations results in significant price changes. This normalization was applied over a sliding window for a broad weekly sentiment perspective taking into account market changes and newly arriving information:\n$\\text{sent}\\text{norm,t} = \\frac{\\text{sent}_t - \\text{sent}_{t,w}}{\\sigma_{t,w}}$\nHere, $\\text{sent}_{t,w}$ represents the mean sentiment over a moving time window starting from the current time point $t$ and going back $w$ time points to $t - w$, and $\\sigma_{t,w}$ denotes the standard deviation within the same period. Furthermore, the output of the sentiment classifiers had to be normalized. For instance, granular sentiment scores from RavenPack and FinBERT typically provide scores in the continuous range, signifying the intensity of the sentiment. For instance, a score of 0.2 might indicate a slightly positive sentiment, while a score of -0.8 could imply a strongly negative sentiment. For compatibility with the values obtained from GPT 3.5, which were not in float format but rather categorical (1 for positive, 0 for neutral, and -1 for negative), it was necessary to remap the granular sentiment scores $x$ based on the observed distribution into these discrete categories as follows:\n$0.1 < x < 1.0 \\rightarrow 1$\n$-0.1 < x < 0.1 \\rightarrow 0$\n$-1.0 < x < -0.1 \\rightarrow -1$\nPrice Normalization The works of Hamilton indicated that the oil price appears to be influenced by a random walk with drift due to market volatility and, therefore, can show random fluctuations that overlap short-term and long-term"}, {"title": "4 Evaluation", "content": "This section delves into the comparative performance analysis of different LMs, which include fine-tuning LMs in terms of the expectations when economic theories are considered, leading to the creation of CrudeBERT.

The notion behind this approach was the economic model introduced by Adam Smith in 1776 [35]. He argued that the value of commodities, like crude oil, is fundamentally influenced by their supply and demand. In this scenario, supply signifies the volume of a commodity available for sale at a specific price during a particular time frame. Conversely, demand signifies the volume that buyers seek at that price during that period. The convergence of these two forces shapes a competitive landscape where the price finds balance through their equilibrium. This equilibrium can be visualized with scenarios such as:\nLess supply & same demand$\\rightarrow$ shortage $\\rightarrow$ higher prices.\nMore supply & same demand$\\rightarrow$ surplus $\\rightarrow$ lower prices.\nLess demand & same supply$\\rightarrow$ surplus $\\rightarrow$ lower prices.\nMore demand & same supply$\\rightarrow$ shortage $\\rightarrow$ higher prices."}, {"title": "4.2 Preliminary Analysis", "content": "Initial observations, presented in Table 1, suggest that the sentiment classifications of FinBERT and GPT 3.5 deviate from our expectations outlined in Section 4.1. These disparities are particularly noteworthy, given that crude oil is a publicly traded commodity, and FinBERT's training is grounded in the wider context of financial news. This unexpected deviation instigates a deeper investigation to understand the underlying causes.\nIn situations where there's a decrease in supply (perhaps due to unforeseen incidents at oil infrastructures), both models lean toward negative sentiment. This is unexpected since such events would typically bolster crude oil prices. One plausible reason for this could be the natural perception that incidents, especially in finance, are considered harmful not just because of the potential operational disruptions but also because of the reputational implications they might carry. A closer look at the Financial Phrase Bank supports this for FinBERT. In contrast, signals of surging demand are typically seen as catalysts for price appreciation. Our experiments with both FinBERT and GPT 3.5 align with this hypothesis.\nConversely, FinBERT generally categorizes headlines that indicate no changes in availability as negative. This could be attributed to the financial sector's inclination towards growth, where no change might be perceived as a setback. GPT 3.5, however, seems to be more aligned with the expectations in this context. Furthermore, a decrease in demand should ideally signal an oversupply, leading to price reduction. This interpretation is largely ratified by FinBERT for most headlines, except for a few anomalies. For instance, GPT 3.5 and FinBERT differ in their assessment of a headline indicating a -16.0% in imports, with the latter seemingly struggling with the negative numbers, which was also observed with similar examples. Lastly, GPT-3.5 misclassified topics, notably those related to oil discoveries and imports, even with an optimized prompt. Such inconsistencies indicate the potential limitations of GPT-3.5 in classifying oil-related news.\nThese observations resonate with findings from Xing et al., suggesting common challenges in using universal sentiment tools for niche sectors. This phenomenon is also known as the domain adaptation problem [41]. This has also been highlighted by the research of Leippold [18], emphasizing the unique language intricacies of specialized domains like climate studies. Potential solutions, as proposed by Weichselbraun et al., involve constructing tailored sentiment models for specific sectors [39]."}, {"title": "4.3 Integration of Language Models with Economic Principles", "content": "The low effectiveness of FinBERT, as noted in 1, motivated an attempt to include the principles of supply and demand into FinBERT such that it behaves to the"}, {"title": "4.4 Evaluation of Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization Results", "content": "A comparative study was undertaken using data presented in 8. This involved the evaluation of different LMs including the financial LM, FinBERT, a fine-tuned LM, CrudeBERT, and an LLM, GPT, with each subjected to various prompt optimizations. Remarkably, CrudeBERT reached an F1 score of 1.0, setting it apart from the rest. From the insights gathered in 8, Simulations 5, 7, and 9 displayed an enhanced performance for the LLM GPT. A notable macro F1 score of 0.84 was recorded, presenting a significant leap from the earlier 0.67 scores when the context was excluded from the prompt. A majority of these prompts efficiently categorized neutral sentiments. However, challenges emerged in sentiment interpretation, especially with headlines linked to accidents and injuries. Unexpectedly, in situations where sentiments were projected to be positive, perhaps due to predicted supply shortages, the models majorly categorized them as negative. To address this, Simulations 5, 7, and 9 were reconfigured to adopt a more discernible sentiment classification technique.\nAs a result, Simulation 9 managed to classify sentiments as positive in the wake of accidents. The full result of each classifier is outlined in 3 from the Appendix 5. For the primary evaluation, the prompt from Simulation 9 was selected. This decision was based on its efficiency in using fewer tokens, while still achieving high performance when compared to other high-performing simulations."}, {"title": "4.5 Evaluation of Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization Results", "content": "The following experiments leverage four different sentiment classifiers (FinBERT, CrudeBERT, RavenPack ESS, and GPT 3.5) including a random classifier as a"}, {"title": "5 Outlook and Conclusion", "content": "The challenge of predicting market movements from the news was highlighted by the experiments described in Section 4. Even advanced models like FinBERT, designed for the general financial domain, faced difficulties when attempting to classify the dynamics of a specific market such as crude oil without fine-tuning to the specific domain. Similarly, despite the multifaceted applications of LLMs, ranging from code generation to poem creation, the assessments of GPT 3.5 have underscored certain constraints. Specifically, these evaluations highlight the challenges LLMs face in extensive classification endeavors when dependent exclusively on an optimized prompt. Moreover, the fine-tuning process of LLMs demands considerable computational and financial resources compared to that of LMs. For assignments with a narrower scope, such as straightforward classification, it might be both economical and efficient to adapt and use a smaller LM tailored for the specific NLP task at hand."}, {"title": "20 Kaplan et al.", "content": "As a remedy, this paper introduced a method for refining LMs, in this case, FinBERT, using domain-specific news headlines. Through a frequency analysis, recurrent topics related to core market factors that affect supply and demand were identified. These topics were then used as search terms to filter and categorize headlines. For this purpose, a 'silver standard' dataset was created for a more reasonable sentiment classification based on the fundamental logic behind supply and demand, which was required in fine-tuning FinBERT into CrudeBERT.\nIn evaluations covering nine years of crude oil futures, it was found that CrudeBERT performed better than both FinBERT, GPT 3.5, and a randomized baseline. Additionally, CrudeBERT showed competitive results against Raven-Pack's established sentiment model, although the differences were only noticeable at the 0.10 significance level. It is also noteworthy that news headlines alone rather than the whole article seem to be sufficient for providing insights into the likely direction of price changes.\nDespite the presented improvements, CrudeBERT still has limitations and will be subject to further developments. For instance, concerns were raised regarding the creation process of the training data for fine-tuning. The current method based on keyword filtering may not effectively handle headlines that provide mixed and contradicting signals regarding supply-demand dynamics.\nLastly, research is needed to assess CrudeBERT's performance over longer periods and its adaptability across different economic conditions. One observation made was that headlines, rather than full articles, appeared to provide adequate information for resembling the market movement. Furthermore, the feasibility of extending the presented method to other commodity markets such as perishable (e.g., coffee beans), non-perishable (e.g., natural gas), precious (e.g., gold), and non-precious (e.g., iron ore) commodities, where pricing may be influenced by similar factors, need also to be investigated.\nThus, to promote further research in asset-specific LMs, the CrudeBERT is made publicly available on the community-driven Hugging Face platform [15]."}, {"title": "Unlabeled Test Dataset", "content": "Unlabeled Test Dataset:\n1.

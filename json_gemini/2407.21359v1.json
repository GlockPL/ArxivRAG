However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies. These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states. To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories. Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed \u201cimagined states\") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions. Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories. Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven indispensable for solving continuous decision problems [1, 2, 3]. Current RL research falls into two main categories: model-based and model-free methods. Model-based methods involve constructing a world model to simulate an interactive environment, which helps the agent predict future trajectories for optimal decision-making. However, these methods can be expensive and prone to failure due to discrepancies between the world model and reality [4]. On the other hand, model-free methods refine the policy function through trial-and-error learning, often outperforming model-based techniques in continuous control tasks [5]. However, these methods require frequent interaction with the environment, which is risky or costly in real-world applications [6], and suffer from low data efficiency when learning from complex, high-dimensional observations (such as image pixels) based on limited experience.\nTraining model-free methods using low data efficiency and sparse signals to fit high-performance feature encoders is challenging and prone to suboptimal convergence [7]. In contrast, humans can learn to play simple arcade games in minutes [8], while even state-of-the-art RL algorithms require billions of frames to reach human-level performance [9]. Moreover, collecting such large amounts of interaction data is impractical, especially in domains such as autonomous driving and robot control."}, {"title": "2 Related work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Prospective thinking", "content": "The capacity to anticipate the future represents as a crucial facet of human cognition, recently garnering substantial attention from researchers [20, 22, 23]. In psychology, prospective thinking is defined as the ability to mentally simulate the future, involving the extraction of information from episodic and semantic memory (such as detailed information about past states) as well as more abstract, schematic, and conceptual knowledge (such as envisioning general goals or events) [24, 25, 26]. Broadly, prospective thinking involves two main aspects: 1) predicting future scenarios and 2) guiding decisions for those scenarios. In deep learning, methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) appear to encapsulate certain aspects of prospective thinking.\nModel-based RL methods aim to construct an internal model, often referred to as a \"World Model,\" to simulate the environment. This model helps predict future states and rewards, guiding the agent's decision-making and planning. Examples include PILCO [27], Dyna-Q [28], and World models [29]. On the other hand, MPC-based methods utilize the world model to optimize trajectories within a shorter time horizon. Examples of such methods include MuZero, Eff.Zero [30], and TD-MPC [5]. However, these approaches heavily rely on accurate environmental modeling and are limited by the complexity of state spaces. Consequently, model-based approaches often struggle to outperform simpler model-free methods in continuous control tasks [5]. Model-free methods, in contrast, learn policies through trial and error, directly interacting with the environment without the need for a World Model. This method is easy to implement and adapts well to complex environments. However, due to the frequent interaction with the environment and the lack of prediction of future states or consequences, it can lead to risky exploration of the environment [6].\nBuilding upon this, we merge the planning capabilities of model-based methods to enhance model-free methods. To achieve this, we introduce a dynamics model into model-free methods, enabling the prediction of future scenarios. Additionally, we integrate the concept of MPC with value consistency to aid decision-making and guidance for future scenarios. Our objective is to leverage prospective thinking in selecting the optimal path while maintaining the trial-and-error learning approach of model-free methods. This integration aims to enhance the effectiveness of model-free methods in learning."}, {"title": "2.2 Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning", "content": "When confronted with a limited amount of interaction data, the performance of both model-based and model-free methods experiences a significant decline. Researchers have extensively investigated this issue from various angles [3, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17]. For example, SiMPLe utilizes collected data to learn a world model and generate imagined trajectories. They achieved outstanding results in multiple games under the setting of 100k frames, albeit at the cost of several weeks of training time. Subsequent studies, such as DataEfficient Rainbow [31] and OTRainbow [32], have demonstrated that merely increasing the number of steps in multi-step returns and conducting more frequent parameter updates can lead to improved performance under conditions of low data efficiency.\nConsequently, there is growing interest in using computer vision techniques to enhance representation learning in RL [12, 13, 7]. For example, DrQ [7] and RAD [13] showed that moderate image augmentation can significantly improve the efficiency of RL data, outperforming previous methods using world models in model-based approaches. Yarats et al. [12] introduced image reconstruction as an auxiliary loss function in RL to improve data efficiency. Inspired by contrastive learning in representation learning, CURL [33] incorporated contrastive loss into RL, allowing the algorithm to distinguish representations of different states through contrastive loss and promote the generation of similar embeddings for similar states. In addition, some studies aim to incorporate dynamical models to help agents predict future events, thereby generating multiple virtual trajectories to improve"}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": "In this section, we will systematically introduce the proposed ProSpec method. First, we will review some preliminary work. Then, we will present the overall framework of ProSpec."}, {"title": "3.1 Preliminaries: Reinforcement Learning", "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) typically uses Markov decision processes (MDPs) to solve continuous decision problems, denoted as < S, A, T, R, \u03b3 >. Here S represents a finite set of states; A is the action space; T(St, at, St+1) = P(st+1|St, at) is the dynamic function, which defines the probability of transition from state st to st+1 after taking action at; R(st, at) is the reward function, and \u03b3\u2208 (0, 1] is the discount factor. The goal of RL is to enable the agent to learn how to maximize the expected discounted cumulative payoff Gt = \u03a3\u03c4=0YR($t+7, at++) by choosing actions at each time t. The agent's decision process is guided by the policy \u03c0(at st), which maps the current state to the action selection. The action-value function Q\u03c0(St, at) = \u0395\u03c0[Gt|st, at] evaluates the expected payoff of taking action at in state st and following policy \u03c0. This paper focuses on value-based RL methods, specifically Q-learning, which approximates the optimal policy \u03c0* using the Bellman equation [37]. Therefore, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is employed as the policy algorithm, given that it is a widely utilized gradient-based algorithm for continuous control that incorporates policy entropy as an additional reward to encourage exploration. The overall training objective of SAC is as follows:\nTo = Lcritic + Lactor + La\nwhere, Lcritic, Lactor and La represent the critic loss, actor loss and temperature loss, respectively (see the supplementary material for details)."}, {"title": "3.2 Overall Framework", "content": "In this paper, we introduce the ProSpec method, which aims to incorporate prospective thinking into model-free methods. ProSpec consists of two main components: first, the Flow-based Dynamics Model for predicting future scenarios, and second, the prospective unit that integrates Model Predictive Control and value consistency to guide decision-making. Figure1 shows the process of ProSpec RL. In the following sections, we provide detailed explanations of each component.\nFlow-based Dynamics Model (FDM). The FDM predicts the future and retroactively infers previous latent states, crucial in ProSpec.

ProSpec employs a reversible flow-based dynamics model to predict latent future outcomes, drawing on the concept of Model Predictive Control to guide decision-making in anticipation of future scenarios. This approach enables RL to simulate future n-stream trajectories, facilitating high-value, low-risk optimal decision-making. Additionally, ProSpec augments state traceability through cycle consistency, reducing environmental risks and leveraging this to augment actions, thus generating a wealth of virtual trajectories to improve data efficiency. We conducted a large number of experiments at DMControl and the results confirmed the effectiveness of ProSpec. However, due to the necessity of exploring future scenarios from multiple perspectives, our method incurs additional overhead in training the agent. In addition, ProSpec is currently tailored for value-based RL methods; future research endeavors will aim to discover a universally applicable RL approach that incorporates prospective thinking."}]}

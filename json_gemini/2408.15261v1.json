While existing literature\nhas explored various problematic aspects of TTI technologies, such as\nbias in generated content, intellectual property concerns, and the re-\ninforcement of harmful stereotypes, open-source TTI frameworks have\nnot yet been systematically examined from a cultural perspective. This\nstudy addresses this gap by analyzing the CivitAI platform, a leading\nopen-source platform dedicated to TTI AI. We introduce the Civiverse\nprompt dataset, encompassing millions of images and related metadata.\nWe focus on prompt analysis, specifically examining the semantic char-\nacteristics of text prompts, as it is crucial for addressing societal issues\nrelated to generative technologies. This analysis provides insights into\nuser intentions, preferences, and behaviors, which in turn shape the out-\nputs of these models. Our findings reveal a predominant preference for\ngenerating explicit content, along with a focus on homogenization of se-\nmantic content.

Initially employing VQGAN [14] and later adopting diffusion mod-\nels [24] with CLIP, open-source Text-to-Image (TTI) pipelines have consistently\nleveraged advancements in combined image and text embedding learning, achiev-\ning impressive results comparable to those of OpenAI. The release of Stable\nDiffusion in August 2022 [5] significantly accelerated the development in open-\nsource TTI, enabling the creation of images that are not only photorealistic but\nalso aesthetically pleasing, from textual user input called prompts. TTI mod-\nels are currently utilized in diverse sectors, with open-sourced Stable Diffusion"}, {"title": "Background and Related Work", "content": "Existing research has demonstrated that biases related to race, gender, and ap-\npearance propagate to multi-modal model outputs, affecting tasks like image\ncaptioning and image search. Image captioning models, for instance, tend to\nstereotype people based on gender or produce poorer quality captions for im-\nages of darker-skinned individuals [37]. Similarly, biases in image search algo-\nrithms reinforce negative stereotypes, impacting the sense of belonging for af-\nfected groups [21]. The widespread use of image generation systems can thus\nhave adverse effects on minority groups who are misrepresented or underrepre-\nsented. The aforementioned biases in TTI systems can originate from multiple\nsources, such as training data scraped from the web, which often contains harm-\nful content and mislabeled examples. Filtering this data for \"aesthetic\" or \"safe\nfor work\" content can introduce further biases, as observed with Dall-E 2's at-\ntempts to filter explicit content leading to bias amplification [27]. However, they\ncan also be perpetuated in the generated image through the text prompts that\nis used by users when interacting with TTI models.\nGiven that, recent advancements in generative AI, particularly with diffusion\nmodels, explore the emerging culture of TTI models through the field of prompt"}, {"title": "The Civiverse 6M Dataset", "content": "As a consequence of open source TTI advancements, various communities and\nplatforms offering services related TTI synthesis have emerged. CivitAI, funded\nby A14z and launched in late 2022, offers on-site image generation as well as the\nexchanges of Stable Diffusion model derivatives. More than 6.5 million images\nhave been posted from October 2023 to April 2024 (Figure 2). The platform is\ngaining popularity in a rapid pace: in September 2023, the average number of\nposted daily images was 13,429. On June 24 th the number of uploaded daily\nimages surpassed 120,000, which is an increase of almost tenfold in a span of\neight months. The amount of generated imagery on the platform is expected to\nbe much higher, as only the images generated and then deliberately posted by\nits users are available through the API. Using the CivitAI open REST API [4],\nwe assembled a dataset, obtaining metadata for 6,546,165 images both created\nand published directly on the site, as well as those produced externally and\nuploaded. Notable is the high proportion of NSFW content observed in the\ndata. The content rating system contrived by the CivitAI team [13] seems to\nbe loosely based on the Motion Picture Association Film Rating system [3], but\ntailored to the content of the site, ranging from PG (safe for all ages) to XXX\n(Overly Sexual or Disturbing Graphic content). The percentage of content rated\nabove PG13 has risen from 55.19% in October 2023 to 72.94% (Figure 2) in\nApril 2024 in a span of 7 months."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This section outlines the methods and tools used to perform a semantic analysis\nof user prompts on the CivitAI platform.

Prompt specifiers are\ntext fragments that specify desired characteristics of the image output. For in-\nstance, examples of specifiers in Figure 1 include \"face focus,\" \"high definition,\"\n\"best quality,\" \"shiny skin,\" \"curvy,\" and \"simple background.\"\nTo standardize our analysis, a methodology similar to Sanchez [26] was\nadopted, where prompts were divided using commas as separators, and specifiers\nappearing at least 500 times and not exceeding 35 characters were considered."}, {"title": "Most Popular Names", "content": "The practice of utilizing artists' names in prompts to produce images in their\nstyle, commonly known as \"style mimicry\", has generated substantial concerns\nwithin the art community [16]. Models can replicate the artistic style of partic-\nular artists by fine-tuning on their work samples, infringing on copyrights and\ndiminishing artists' motivation to create original pieces [29]. This issue under-\nscores the necessity of identifying the most frequently used artists' names in\ntext-to-image prompts, as it can quantify the scale of style appropriation and\ninform strategies to safeguard artists' intellectual property and encourage their\ncreative endeavors.\nIn this study, the SpaCy library was utilized to perform Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) with a focus on identifying PERSON entities, by employing\nthe pre-trained NER model en_core_web_sm provided by the library.\nA temporal evolution analysis of the Civiverse 6M dataset was performed\nby splitting it into four distinct periods. The first period comprises September\nand October 2023 (with a total of 504,296 prompts), and the second period\ncomprises November and December 2023 (with a total of 1,214,284 prompts).\nThe analysis was conducted only on the positive prompts, as negative prompts\ntypically do not contain named entities. The frequency of occurrences for the 10\nmost popular names per period was calculated to evaluate the evolution of these\nnames over time. The frequency for each artist was computed as a percentage\nof the total prompts in their respective period.\nCompute Infrastructure.

In Figure 4, we\npresent the 50 most prominent thematic clusters. Additionally, a bar chart in\nFigure 3 displays the 8 most representative topics along with their corresponding\nkeywords.\nOne of the primary categories in the categorization of specifiers is Subject.\nWithin this category, the most frequently featured figures are humans, partic-\nularly women, with a notable prevalence of anime characters such as \"Ochako\nUraraka,\" \"Inaho Kaizuka,\" and \"Hinata.\" There is a discernible tendency to-\nwards specifying nationality, predominantly focusing on Asian cultures, espe-\ncially \"Japanese\" and \"Korean.\" Additionally, there is significant emphasis on\nBody Characteristics, ranging from Body Types (e.g., \"fat girl,\" \"slim waist,\" \"fit\nfigure\") to Lower Body Parts like Thighs (e.g., \"round thighs,\" \"toned thighs,\"\n\"juicy thighs\"), Hips, Arms (e.g., \"mechanical arm,\" \"strong arms\"), Feet (e.g.,\n\"barefoot,\" \"big feet\"), and Belly (e.g., \"slim belly\", \"exposed belly\"). Physi-\ncal characteristics such as Skin Tone and Texture, Hair Types, and Smiles (e.g.,\n\"friendly smile,\" \"seductive grin\") are also frequently specified.\nThere is also a noticeable tendency to emphasize Sexuality and Nudity,\nwith detailed depictions of both Female and Male Genitalia, female upper bodies,\nparticularly Breasts, and Male Spermatic Fluids. Subjects are often portrayed in\nhighly sexualized poses, described as \"provocative,\" \"alluring,\" and \"sensual,\"\nwith an aesthetic focus on body types using terms like \"voluptuous hips\" and\n\"seductive physique.\"\nMoreover, a notable tendency exists to specify the Point of View towards\nthe viewer, using phrases like \"looking straight at the viewer,\" \"smiling at the\nviewer,\" and \"seducing the viewer,\" emphasizing direct engagement and making\nthe viewer feel like a participant rather than an observer.\nSpecifiers also frequently indicate the Medium used in image generation,\ncovering traditional and contemporary digital techniques. Photographic tech-\nniques are emphasized, with precise elements like Focus (e.g., \"manual focus\"),\nISO settings (e.g., \"iso100\"), and various Camera Lenses (e.g., \"50mm\"). High-\nresolution images are highlighted by terms like \"hdr\" and \"4k.\" Additionally,\nPolaroid-inspired styles and filters (e.g., \"polaroid,\" \"vibrant\") and Cinematic\nAesthetics (e.g., \"cinematic,\" \"hollywood\") are prominent.\nFurthermore, there is a tendency to include the Names of digital artists,\nphotographers, and painters to prompt the model to imitate their style in the\ngenerated image.

Specifiers like\n\"lighting,\" \"shadows,\" \"neon,\" and \"glow\" highlight the importance of ambiance\nand the dramatic impact of light and shadow. The Colors category shows a\npreference for rich, vibrant palettes, with specifiers like \"vivid\" and \"vibrant\"\nindicating a tendency towards bold, intense colors to enhance visual impact and\nconvey a dynamic atmosphere."}, {"title": null, "content": "Through the categorization of specifiers used for\nthe negative prompts, we can gain a clearer understanding of which features and\nelements users prefer to avoid in their visually generated content. The results of\nthe topic modeling on the 11,000 specifiers from the negative prompts yielded\napproximately 70 topics. In Figure 6, we present the 50 most prominent thematic\nclusters. Additionally, a bar chart in Figure 5 displays the 8 most representative\ntopics along with their corresponding keywords.\nAs with positive prompts, the Subject category remains primary in nega-\ntive prompts, particularly focusing on Expressions and Emotions. Users generally\navoid unsettling emotions such as \"emotionless,\" \"repulsive feeling,\" \"disgusting\nlook,\" or \"bizarre,\" and unpleasant expressions like \"overly angry,\" \"extremely\nsad,\" or \"mean face.\" Additionally, Facial Features are frequently specified in\nnegative prompts, including both broad descriptions (e.g., \"weird,\" \"bad,\" or \"in-\ncomplete facial features\") and more detailed ones. Specifically, undesirable Eye\nFeatures (e.g., \"closed eyelids,\" \"under-eye bags,\" \"misshaped eyes\"), unattrac-\ntive Pupils and Irises (e.g., \"deformed pupils,\" \"distorted irises\"), and unap-\npealing Teeth and Mouth details (e.g., \"discolored,\" \"missing teeth\") are noted.\nPoor Skin Conditions, such as \"acne,\" \"pimples,\" \"noisy skin texture,\" and \"age\nspots,\" are also commonly specified.\nIn addition to facial and emotional aspects, users frequently mention specific\nAnimals and their corresponding Animal Features, likely aiming to avoid these\nelements in generated content. For example, animals like \"spiders,\" \"reptiles,\"\nand \"wolves\" are often mentioned negatively. Features such as \"snake noses,\"\n\"rabbit ears,\" \"snake tongue,\" \"cow faces,\" and \"horse heads\" are included to\nprevent unnatural or off-putting anthropomorphic characteristics.\nRegarding Clothing, users specify styles and types of attire to avoid in their\nnegative prompts, such as \"trashy,\" \"extra,\" \"maternity,\" \"prisoner,\" \"poor,\"\nand \"badly fitted clothes.\" Certain types of clothing that are not stereotypi-\ncally considered non-appealing, like \"evening gowns,\" \"fluttering costumes,\" and\n\"shiny clothes,\" are also avoided to ensure the generated content aligns with the\nuser's vision.\nA significant number of negative prompts focus on the category of Body\nHorror, often depicting clear representations of the human body to counter-\nact typical AI-generated imperfections. This category includes aspects related\nto Sexuality and Nudity, aiming to counteract unwanted representations\nof Female and Male Genitalia, Female Breasts and Nipples, and Gluteal Re-\ngions. Specifications often address details related to shape and size, using terms\nlike \"small,\" \"tiny,\" \"medium,\" \"huge,\" and \"giant,\" as well as malformations\nand abnormalities such as \"missing,\" \"double,\" \"misaligned,\" \"multiple,\" and\n\"weird.\" Additionally, colors to avoid, such as \"colorful,\" \"black,\" \"red,\" and\n\"green,\" are specified. Other aspects include avoiding disjointed or extra body"}, {"title": null, "content": "parts, Severed Limbs, Contorted Torsos, and Malformed Necks and Collars, as\nwell as undesirable Body Weight attributes like \"overweight,\" \"anorexic,\" and\n\"fat woman.\"\nIn terms of Resolution and Clarity, users aim to counteract issues like\nLow Resolution, which results in a lack of detail and sharpness, through specifiers\nsuch as \"lowres\" and \"low quality.\" Issues related to Compression and Artifacts\n(e.g., \"jpeg large artifacts,\" \"compressed images\") are also addressed. For the\nLighting and Illumination category, users avoid undesirable conditions with\nspecifiers like \"harsh light,\" \"inconsistent light,\" and \"neon light,\" as well as\nissues related to Shadows and Shading (e.g., \"heavy shadows,\" \"flat shading\").\nIn the Color Palette category, specifiers address unwanted color conditions,\nspecifically targeting a lack of vibrancy (e.g., \"missing colors,\" \"messy colors,\"\n\"faded colors,\" \"dull colors,\" \"unsaturated colors\"), and issues with Saturation\nand Exposure (e.g., \"highly saturated,\" \"oversaturation,\" \"saturated colors\")."}, {"title": "Popular Names", "content": "The temporal analysis of the Civiverse dataset highlights significant trends\nin the use of artist names in TTI prompts, illustrating the practice of \"style\nmimicry\".

Similarly,"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In exploring the problematic aspects of TTI models, the emphasis has so far\nbeen on examining the visual outputs of popular TTI models or training data\nused for the development of such models. Our study shifts the focus by accu-\nmulating user input (prompts) alongside other metadata to better understand\nuser interactions with TTI models. This approach reveals how these interactions\ncan reinforce or challenge existing issues, providing insights into the broader so-\ncietal implications of these technologies in an open-source setting. The trends\nidentified in our analysis show that as the popularity and user base of platforms\nsuch as CivitAI and the hosted models grow, there is not only an absolute in-\ncrease in pornographic content but also a disproportionate rise in its proportion\nrelative to SFW content. The predominant and growing preference among the\nusers for generating explicit content, and the homogenization of semantic con-\ntent revealed a necessity for further research into the perpetuation of misogyny,\nharmful stereotypes, and the uniformity of visual culture that emerges from the\ninteraction with models on platforms such as CivitAI. This initial analysis of the\ndataset was limited on linguistically evaluating user prompts (positive, negative),\nyet other attributes such as utilized models and adapters as well as parameters\ninvolved in the image genesis, will be included in a follow-up research to obtain\na more granular understanding.\nEven though CivitAI is the most established model-sharing and open-source\nplatform for image generation, the results might be skewed by the specific cul-\nture of its presumably presumably technologically adept user base and the fact\nthat other established TTI services such as DALLE or Adobe Firefly have strict\npolicies on NSFW content. This may cause users with certain inclinations to\ngravitate towards open-source TTI alternatives. Therefore, the data might not\nreflect how open-source TTI AI is used by the entirety of TTI users across all sys-\ntems. Nonetheless, platform usage statistics gathered over the past months show\nan accelerating growth rate, indicating that the platform is no longer limited to\na small, specialized group."}]}

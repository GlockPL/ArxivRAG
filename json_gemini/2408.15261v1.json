{"title": "Civiverse: A Dataset for Analyzing User Engagement with Open-Source Text-to-Image Models", "authors": ["Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini", "Laura Wagner", "Eva Cetinic"], "abstract": "Text-to-image (TTI) systems, particularly those utilizing open-source frameworks, have become increasingly prevalent in the production of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated visuals. While existing literature has explored various problematic aspects of TTI technologies, such as bias in generated content, intellectual property concerns, and the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes, open-source TTI frameworks have not yet been systematically examined from a cultural perspective. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the CivitAI platform, a leading open-source platform dedicated to TTI AI. We introduce the Civiverse prompt dataset, encompassing millions of images and related metadata. We focus on prompt analysis, specifically examining the semantic characteristics of text prompts, as it is crucial for addressing societal issues related to generative technologies. This analysis provides insights into user intentions, preferences, and behaviors, which in turn shape the outputs of these models. Our findings reveal a predominant preference for generating explicit content, along with a focus on homogenization of semantic content. These insights underscore the need for further research into the perpetuation of misogyny, harmful stereotypes, and the uniformity of visual culture within these models.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "When OpenAI announced DALL\u00b7E, a TTI system with unprecedented capabilities [22], and released the Contrastive Language and Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision transformer architecture [22], it laid the foundation for its open-source competitors. Initially employing VQGAN [14] and later adopting diffusion models [24] with CLIP, open-source Text-to-Image (TTI) pipelines have consistently leveraged advancements in combined image and text embedding learning, achieving impressive results comparable to those of OpenAI. The release of Stable Diffusion in August 2022 [5] significantly accelerated the development in open-source TTI, enabling the creation of images that are not only photorealistic but also aesthetically pleasing, from textual user input called prompts. TTI models are currently utilized in diverse sectors, with open-sourced Stable Diffusion"}, {"title": "Background and Related Work", "content": "Existing research has demonstrated that biases related to race, gender, and appearance propagate to multi-modal model outputs, affecting tasks like image captioning and image search. Image captioning models, for instance, tend to stereotype people based on gender or produce poorer quality captions for images of darker-skinned individuals [37]. Similarly, biases in image search algorithms reinforce negative stereotypes, impacting the sense of belonging for affected groups [21]. The widespread use of image generation systems can thus have adverse effects on minority groups who are misrepresented or underrepresented. The aforementioned biases in TTI systems can originate from multiple sources, such as training data scraped from the web, which often contains harmful content and mislabeled examples. Filtering this data for \"aesthetic\" or \"safe for work\" content can introduce further biases, as observed with Dall-E 2's attempts to filter explicit content leading to bias amplification [27]. However, they can also be perpetuated in the generated image through the text prompts that is used by users when interacting with TTI models.\nGiven that, recent advancements in generative AI, particularly with diffusion models, explore the emerging culture of TTI models through the field of prompt"}, {"title": "The Civiverse 6M Dataset", "content": "As a consequence of open source TTI advancements, various communities and platforms offering services related TTI synthesis have emerged. CivitAI, funded by A14z and launched in late 2022, offers on-site image generation as well as the exchanges of Stable Diffusion model derivatives. More than 6.5 million images have been posted from October 2023 to April 2024 (Figure 2). The platform is gaining popularity in a rapid pace: in September 2023, the average number of posted daily images was 13,429. On June 24 th the number of uploaded daily images surpassed 120,000, which is an increase of almost tenfold in a span of eight months. The amount of generated imagery on the platform is expected to be much higher, as only the images generated and then deliberately posted by its users are available through the API. Using the CivitAI open REST API [4], we assembled a dataset, obtaining metadata for 6,546,165 images both created and published directly on the site, as well as those produced externally and uploaded. Notable is the high proportion of NSFW content observed in the data. The content rating system contrived by the CivitAI team [13] seems to be loosely based on the Motion Picture Association Film Rating system [3], but tailored to the content of the site, ranging from PG (safe for all ages) to XXX (Overly Sexual or Disturbing Graphic content). The percentage of content rated above PG13 has risen from 55.19% in October 2023 to 72.94% (Figure 2) in April 2024 in a span of 7 months."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This section outlines the methods and tools used to perform a semantic analysis of user prompts on the CivitAI platform. The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the most common topics and styles present in user prompts, as well as the use of names, which can reveal patterns in user behavior and how TTI systems might perpetuate or amplify societal biases and other ethically dubious content."}, {"title": "Topic Modeling", "content": "Inspired by previous work on prompt analysis [19, 26] using the DiffusionDB dataset [36], our study focused on 6.1 million unique positive user prompts and 5.7 million unique negative user prompts from the Civiverse 6M dataset. Given the challenges posed by raw prompts-varying in format, length, and content-individual prompt specifiers were analyzed instead. Prompt specifiers are text fragments that specify desired characteristics of the image output. For instance, examples of specifiers in Figure 1 include \"face focus,\" \"high definition,\" \"best quality,\" \"shiny skin,\" \"curvy,\" and \"simple background.\"\nTo standardize our analysis, a methodology similar to Sanchez [26] was adopted, where prompts were divided using commas as separators, and specifiers appearing at least 500 times and not exceeding 35 characters were considered."}, {"title": "Most Popular Names", "content": "The practice of utilizing artists' names in prompts to produce images in their style, commonly known as \"style mimicry\", has generated substantial concerns within the art community [16]. Models can replicate the artistic style of particular artists by fine-tuning on their work samples, infringing on copyrights and diminishing artists' motivation to create original pieces [29]. This issue underscores the necessity of identifying the most frequently used artists' names in text-to-image prompts, as it can quantify the scale of style appropriation and inform strategies to safeguard artists' intellectual property and encourage their creative endeavors.\nIn this study, the SpaCy library was utilized to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) with a focus on identifying PERSON entities, by employing the pre-trained NER model en_core_web_sm provided by the library.\nA temporal evolution analysis of the Civiverse 6M dataset was performed by splitting it into four distinct periods. The first period comprises September and October 2023 (with a total of 504,296 prompts), and the second period comprises November and December 2023 (with a total of 1,214,284 prompts). The analysis was conducted only on the positive prompts, as negative prompts typically do not contain named entities. The frequency of occurrences for the 10 most popular names per period was calculated to evaluate the evolution of these names over time. The frequency for each artist was computed as a percentage of the total prompts in their respective period.\nCompute Infrastructure. All experiments were conducted on a compute cluster running Debian GNU/Linux 10 with Intel Xeon E5-2650 v4 2.20GHz processors with 24 cores and 128GB RAM and Python 3.8.10."}, {"title": "Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "Popular Topics", "content": "(a) Positive Prompts: The results of the topic modeling on the 19,000 specifiers from the positive prompts yielded approximately 100 topics, with many being repeated or belonging to the same semantic category. In Figure 4, we present the 50 most prominent thematic clusters. Additionally, a bar chart in Figure 3 displays the 8 most representative topics along with their corresponding keywords.\nOne of the primary categories in the categorization of specifiers is Subject. Within this category, the most frequently featured figures are humans, particularly women, with a notable prevalence of anime characters such as \"Ochako Uraraka,\" \"Inaho Kaizuka,\" and \"Hinata.\" There is a discernible tendency towards specifying nationality, predominantly focusing on Asian cultures, especially \"Japanese\" and \"Korean.\" Additionally, there is significant emphasis on"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In exploring the problematic aspects of TTI models, the emphasis has so far been on examining the visual outputs of popular TTI models or training data used for the development of such models. Our study shifts the focus by accumulating user input (prompts) alongside other metadata to better understand user interactions with TTI models. This approach reveals how these interactions can reinforce or challenge existing issues, providing insights into the broader societal implications of these technologies in an open-source setting. The trends identified in our analysis show that as the popularity and user base of platforms such as CivitAI and the hosted models grow, there is not only an absolute increase in pornographic content but also a disproportionate rise in its proportion relative to SFW content. The predominant and growing preference among the users for generating explicit content, and the homogenization of semantic content revealed a necessity for further research into the perpetuation of misogyny, harmful stereotypes, and the uniformity of visual culture that emerges from the interaction with models on platforms such as CivitAI. This initial analysis of the dataset was limited on linguistically evaluating user prompts (positive, negative), yet other attributes such as utilized models and adapters as well as parameters involved in the image genesis, will be included in a follow-up research to obtain a more granular understanding.\nEven though CivitAI is the most established model-sharing and open-source platform for image generation, the results might be skewed by the specific culture of its presumably presumably technologically adept user base and the fact that other established TTI services such as DALLE or Adobe Firefly have strict policies on NSFW content. This may cause users with certain inclinations to gravitate towards open-source TTI alternatives. Therefore, the data might not reflect how open-source TTI AI is used by the entirety of TTI users across all systems. Nonetheless, platform usage statistics gathered over the past months show an accelerating growth rate, indicating that the platform is no longer limited to a small, specialized group."}]}

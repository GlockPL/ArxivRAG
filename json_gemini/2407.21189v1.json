Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation. We also quantify the memory capacity and nonlinearity of each parallelized RC and relate these properties to the performance of each task. Finally, we provide insight into the impact of the feedback mechanism on the performance of the system.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Over recent years, the development of photonic computing has caught a lot of attention from the scientific community and positioned photonics as a potential technology for novel computing schemes (Huang et al.,"}, {"title": "2 MULTITASK WDM MRR-BASED TDRC", "content": "On a high level, the TDRC scheme based on an MRR relies on injecting the input data encoded onto an optical carrier into the MRR at its input port and detecting a non-linearly transformed version at the drop port.

Our proposal is then to use several resonances of the MRR as the base of a WDM TDRC where we use multiple optical channels (each detuned from its respective resonance) to address more computing tasks simultaneously.

Given the bandgap of silicon, the electromagnetic field in such a wavelength range triggers the generation of free carriers via two-photon absorption (TPA) in the MRR cavity. The surge of excess carriers yields free carrier dispersion (FCD) which decreases the effective refractive index of the silicon, and results in a blue shift of the MRR resonance. Free-carrier absorption losses and the subsequent conversion of optical power to heat increase the temperature in the cavity. The resulting thermo-optic (TO) effect increases the refractive index and causes a red shift of the resonance. The nonlinear dynamics of FCD and the TO effect are a source of multistability and self-pulsing in the MRR, which have been extensively studied over the years (Johnson et al., 2006; Van Vaerenbergh et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Borghi et al., 2021).\nHenceforth, the MRR is an optical device capable of generating nonlinear optical dynamics that can be used for computing applications in SOI platform as reviewed in (Biasi et al., 2024). The input data of MRR-based TDRC modulates these dynamics to achieve the nonlinear temporal expansion of the input. The lifetime of the generated free carrier is usually in the order of 1-10 ns while the TO effect is slower in silicon: the thermal time constant is an order of magnitude higher (Zhang et al., 2013; Biasi et al., 2024). Therefore, modulating the input data sequence with a rate (1 GBd) results in a symbol duration with a similar order of magnitude as the time constants governing the nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to exploit such nonlinear dynamics for computing purposes.\nWe mathematically modeled the nonlinear effects in the MRR cavity when injecting multiple optical channels in the MRR. We use TCMT and consider the contribution of the modal amplitude of each optical channel $a_i(t)$ with its respective rate equation. No counterpropagating modes in the microring cavity are considered. The rate equation of $a_i(t)$ is given by Eq. (6).\n$\\frac{da_i(t)}{dt} = [i\\delta_i(t) - \\gamma_i(t)]a_i(t)+\\frac{i \\kappa_c}{T_c}[E_{in_i}(t) + E_{add_i}(t)],$ (6)\nwhere we define $\\delta_i(t)$ as the total angular frequency detuning of channel $i$ with respect to its resonance. $\\gamma_i(t)$ is the total loss rate in the cavity. The last term in Eq. (6) consists of the electric fields of the $i^{th}$ carrier at the add $(E_{add_i})$ and drop $(E_{drop_i})$ ports of the MRR. $\\kappa_c = \\sqrt{2/T_c}$ is the factor of modal amplitude decay rate due to the coupling between the MRR and the bus waveguides, where $1/T_c$ is the loss rate of the cavity"}, {"title": "2.4 Output layer", "content": "At the output of the reservoir (drop port of the MRR), the $M$ WDM signals are wavelength-demultiplexed and detected by individual photodiodes.

How long an input drives or has an influence on the reservoir state is limited, which reduces the computing load in RC schemes. However, this also limits the number of past inputs that it can accurately predict. Therefore, we can quantify the memory capacity (MC) of RC by evaluating the ability of a particular RC scheme to reconstruct its own input K steps in the past. As first defined by (Jaeger, 2002), the linear MC of RC can be calculated by training it to reconstruct the input (usually uniformly distributed) given by $y_K(n) = u(n - K)$. The mathematical expression for a specific value of K is defined as:\n$C[y_K] = 1 - NMSE[y_K].$ (22)\nThere is a limit to the significant K steps contributing to the memory capacity of a given RC scheme. In (Dambre et al., 2012) it is demonstrated to be equal to the number of nodes N, so that the value used for $K_{max}$ in this work is 50. The total linear MC is defined as the sum of the capacities considering all the values of $K < K_{max}$:\n$C_{lin} = \\sum_K^{K_{max}} C[y_K].$ (23)\nThe previous definition accounts only for the linear MC of the system. In order to expand the definition to higher-order functions we can generalize the concept as the reconstruction of a set of basis functions in the Hilbert space of fading memory functions (Dambre et al., 2012; H\u00fclser et al., 2023). The nonlinear memory capacity is calculated by using a basis out of finite products of higher-order Legendre polynomials. The basis function of the $i^{th}$-order is noted as $P_i$, for $y_i(n) = P_i$. Thus, the nonlinear capacities are defined as follows:\n$C_i = \\sum_K^{K_{max}} (1 - NMSE[P_i, \\hat{y}_K]).$ (24)\nThen, the total memory capacity MC, or the so-called, information processing capacity, (Jaeger, 2002; H\u00fclser et al., 2023) is calculated by summing-up all capacities of the $i^{th}$ order up to the highest order of function considered, $H$:\n$MC = \\sum_i^H C_i$ (25)\nIn this work, $H = 3$ as this value matches the highest nonlinear order memory required by the tasks, specifically, the wireless channel equalization task."}, {"title": "3.6 Nonlinearity metric of the MRR-based TDRC", "content": "From Eq.

Each region shows clearly distinguishable levels of NMSE as observed in Fig. 2 for the NARMA-10 task. Similar behavior is found for other tasks in (Giron Castro et al., 2024a) according to their respective performance metrics. Region A corresponds to the linear regime of the MRR and therefore lacks nonlinearity to properly address the computing tasks. The nonlinearity of the photodiode provides some higher dimensionality at the output but not enough to address the tasks with good performance.\nRegion B achieves sufficient nonlinearity to address a particular task without sacrificing memory. This is the region of interest in which we can operate this system. The best performance (NMSE = 0.0178) is exhibited at $P_{in}$ = -5.0 dBm and $\\Delta\\omega/2\\pi$ = 30 GHz. Region C is characterized by very detrimental self-pulsing, which causes a significant penalty in memory and performance.

The phase shift experienced by each channel depends on its wavelength according to (Eq. (11)). Further analysis of the impact of the phase shift in the system is realized in Section 4.7.\nHere, we first test if the performance of the system shows the same behavior for a $M > 1$ number of optical channels over the parameter space of $P_i$ and $\\Delta\\omega_i$.

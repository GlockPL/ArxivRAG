However, constructing such contexts is challenging as it requires teachers to explore substantial amounts of interdisciplinary content and link it to the reading materials. In this paper, we develop LitLinker via an iterative design process involving 13 teachers to facilitate the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. Powered by a large language model (LLM), LitLinker can recommend interdisciplinary topics and contextualize them with literary elements (e.g., paragraphs, viewpoints) in the reading materials. A within-subjects study (N=16) shows that compared to an LLM chatbot, LitLinker can improve the integration depth of different subjects and reduce workload in this ideation task. Expert interviews (N=9) also demonstrate LitLinker's usefulness for supporting the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. We conclude with concerns and design considerations for supporting interdisciplinary teaching with LLMs.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The integration of knowledge from different disciplines within literature instruction at the elementary school level has been proven to enhance student learning outcomes [34, 44]. Contextualization, as a pedagogical approach, makes the curriculum more meaningful and practical for students, which is essential for effective learning [18]. Learning in an interdisciplinary context not only enhances students' comprehensive learning abilities but also increases their motivation to learn. However, the ideation of a suitable interdisciplinary context is challenging. Firstly, human knowledge is categorized into distinct disciplines, and people with an occupation usually focus their expertise on a single field [45]. The development of an interdisciplinary context requires literature teachers to engage in the continuous exploration and evaluation of substantial amounts of information from unfamiliar fields (e.g., mathematics, science, and art). Secondly, elementary school teachers frequently face constraints related to limited time outside of the classroom [13], which do not allow them to conduct comprehensive searches for interdisciplinary knowledge.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) show great potential to address the challenges faced by teachers in ideating interdisciplinary contexts. Such as GPT-4 \u00b9 and GLM-4 \u00b2, possess extensive knowledge across various domains, owing to their pre-training on large text datasets [7]. Also, LLMs' capabilities in long-context understanding [59] enable them to synthesize information from extensive textual materials effectively. Within the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), the LLM-empowered tools have emerged to facilitate interdisciplinary information exploration [68], lesson plan preparation based on educational theories [17], and"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "2.1 Interdisciplinary and Literature Instruction\nInterdisciplinary education equips students to think across subject boundaries, addressing complex global challenges and enhancing critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills [48]. Its growing importance is evident in fostering adaptable, innovative learners for a rapidly changing world [64]. By applying language in real-world contexts, disciplinary approaches promote engagement [56]. Interdisciplinary education offers key advantages in K-12 language learning, promoting critical thinking, creativity, and motivation by connecting learning to real-world issues [2, 23]. Empirical studies often focus on STEM fields, such as English [15]'s integration approach and Sarama et al. [50]'s C4L curriculum, which combines language learning with early childhood development. Also, Czerniak and Johnson [12] demonstrated how interdisciplinary science teaching enhances language development.\nWith the introduction of the new curriculum standards by China's Ministry of Education in 2022, interdisciplinary curriculum design was formally included in the \u201cexpansive learning task group\u201d of Chinese language education, explicitly outlining requirements for interdisciplinary teaching \u2074. Guided by these new standards, interdisciplinary teaching in primary school Chinese language classes can bring a fresh perspective to Chinese language education. By the design of diverse interdisciplinary activities, course content is integrated to cultivate students' active learning and inquiry skills. Additionally, reading instruction fosters students' interdisciplinary thinking abilities, promotes cross-subject integration, and stimulates students' imagination. However, few works focus on integrating literature with other subjects and customizing technologies for diverse teaching environments. Teachers could face challenges in preparing for interdisciplinary literature teaching due to inadequate professional development [3, 61]. Our work is motivated by the trend and benefits of interdisciplinary literature teaching and aims to help teachers ideate interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature in elementary schools."}, {"title": "2.2 Interactive Systems that Support Brainstorming and Ideation", "content": "Interactive systems have been widely used to facilitate the creative thinking processes, including art design [20, 24], writing [21], and learning [29]. Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) provide numerous advantages due to their interactive nature. For instance, C2Ideas [27], an innovative system for designers to ideate color schemes, provides users with an interactive workflow that aligns with traditional interior design methods to facilitate the design process. Users are required to input their initial design intentions and customize the intermediate results, after which the system generates good outcomes. Furthermore, in the field of supporting creative activities within interdisciplinary environments, DiscipLink [68] assists users in making sense of information by generating exploratory questions, expanding queries, and extracting themes and connections among academic papers. Users can freely explore the carefully designed Orientation View, Exploration View, and Collection View of the user interface, a layout that we also use.\nMore and more creativity support interactive systems are being designed for specific tasks in particular professions [10, 33, 37, 47]. For example, AngleKindling [47] is designed to assist journalists in exploring diverse angles for reporting on press releases. This work is similar to ours, as the creativity support also comes from analyzing large amounts of textual material, and our work also leverages the capabilities of LLMs. There also has been a growing trend toward the integration of human-computer interaction (HCI) and education. This integration has led to the development of interactive systems aimed at enhancing educational outcomes by promoting users' creative thinking [66]. NaCava [60] is a mobile interactive system designed to facilitate nature-inspired creativity for children. It enhances children's multidimensional observation and engagement with nature by encouraging the collection of multimodal materials and using them in a creation process.\nHowever, few studies focus on developing creativity support tools for teachers to help them design classroom activities to promote student learning, especially in interdisciplinary setups. In our work, we create LitLinker aimed at teachers to help them ideate interdisciplinary contexts in education, offering creativity support to facilitate the ideation process."}, {"title": "2.3 Large Language Models in Education", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized across various educational domains due to their capacity to facilitate personalized learning experiences and enhance accessibility for all learners [40]. They support self-learning to enhance personal skills in diverse areas, including programming [63], problem-solving ability [30], and writing skills [52]. Additionally, they also support various activities within classroom environments, such as helping with homework, reviewing [40], and assisting students in project-based learning [67]. Specifically, within the K-12 educational domain, LLMs have demonstrated their effectiveness in providing assistance across multiple subjects, including foreign languages, programming, and mathematics [41]. This capability is attributed to their pre-training on large datasets across various fields [7]. Recent work also suggested that designing multiple LLM agents to simulate human collaboration can enhance the quality of the outputs on domain-specific tasks, such as translation [58] and software development [14]. Inspired by these works, we leverage the potential of LLMs and deploy them as agents to generate precise and comprehensive interdisciplinary information in our study.\nLLMs also promote instructional activities for teachers. For instance, RetLLM-E [39] provides instructional support by delivering context-aware, high-quality answers to student questions using LLMs. This research illustrates that retrieved context can significantly increase the quality of LLM-generated responses, thereby informing the advantages of utilizing retrieval-augmented generation [32] for precise instruction. Furthermore, LessonPlanner [17], an LLM-driven tool that formulates structured lesson plans based on educational theories, has been empirically validated to assist teachers in increasing the efficiency of lesson preparation and the quality of lesson plans. The objectives of our work are similar to theirs, as both emphasize the quality of outcomes and the user experience.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in education, but few works focus on teachers' preparation for interdisciplinary instruction scenarios. In our work, we conduct an iterative design with 13 teachers to understand their views on how LLMs can facilitate interdisciplinary literature instruction and support them."}, {"title": "3 Design Process and Principles of LitLinker", "content": "Our work aims to support elementary literature teachers in effectively identifying suitable interdisciplinary contexts for their instructions, which can be used in their later lesson plans and classroom activity designs. Our design process and evaluation of LitLinker involve in total of 17 Chinese language teachers (Table 1) in an elementary school in mainland China. Specifically, in the design process, we involved E1-E7 in the foundational study and I1-16 in the evaluation of the prototype. In the evaluation of LitLinker with teachers (i.e., Experiment II), we involved E1-E5 again and E8-11. In Experiment II, I1-16 also contributed findings about the unchanged features between LitLinker and its prototype.\n3.1 Design Process\nWe generally followed a user-centered approach to plan our design process. First, to understand users' practices and involve them in the design of LitLinker, we conducted three sessions of semi-structured interviews with an experienced literature teacher E1, who led a seven-member (E1 - E7) interdisciplinary literature course design team that indirectly contributed to the interviews. We were not able to have direct discussions with E2 - E7 due to their inconvenience during the semester. Then, we developed a workable prototype of LitLinker and evaluated it with another six teachers (11 - 16). We gathered their insights to inform our design goals for LitLinker presented in this paper.\n3.1.1 Foundational Study. We closely worked with E1 to identify the practices, challenges and needs for support of ideating interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature in elementary schools. Over the past two years, E1 has spearheaded a team of seven individuals (E1-E7) in the exploration and implementation of interdisciplinary literature instruction within elementary school Chinese courses."}, {"title": "3.2 Findings", "content": "Two of the authors utilized thematic analysis [5] to inductively code and summarize the practices, challenges, requirements, and concerns from transcribed recordings in the design process. The key themes are shown below. One author first iteratively coded the data, while the other carefully reviewed the codes to ensure accuracy. After discussions, they reached a consensus and identified six primary themes. These findings are shown below.\nFinding 1: In practice, teachers usually engage in reverse thinking when ideating interdisciplinary context. Our teachers mentioned two intellectual paradigms. One paradigm referred to as \"forward thinking\", resembles \"deductive reasoning\", in which teachers create abstract connections from a limited number of reading materials (typically 3-5 texts) and develop a concrete and reasonable context. The other paradigm, which is termed \"reverse thinking\" and analogous to \"inductive reasoning\", is a more habitual cognitive process employed by teachers. Teachers would like to first select interdisciplinary contexts that they deem suitable and then identify appropriate texts from a broader text pool, after which they refine the connections between the identified text and the context. \"For us, a good context often arises from a sudden inspiration, which we then backtrack to complete the ideation of what texts can connect to this context and how\" (\u03951).\nFinding 2: It is challenging to identify the connections between the established context and the reading materials in the process of \"reverse thinking\u201d. Teachers must evaluate the effectiveness of the connections in enhancing students' understanding of both literature and its associated subjects, as well as in stimulating their interest. \"It is quite difficult and usually takes a long time for our team to ensure that based on the reading materials, our teaching activities connected by the context can indeed help students gain knowledge\" (E1).\nFinding 3: Teachers require support at three levels of granularity when analyzing the reading materials and contexts. The first level is in-depth single-text analysis, which \"explains how the elements of a given article relate to the context\" (E1). The second level is pairwise comparison, where comparative reading has been demonstrated to be an effective method for understanding texts, \"allowing articles to 'disappear in pairs' by analyzing the similarities and differences in relation to the context\" (E1). The third level is multi-text-driven exploration, which necessitates that the system should support the comprehensive linking of all texts selected by the teacher. Therefore, this level requires LitLinker to conduct a thorough deconstruction of contexts, extract meaningful connections, and convey these connections to the teachers.\nFinding 4: Teachers require detailed instructional activities based on the selected contexts. As E1 summarized after the meeting with her teaching team, the outcome plan of several lessons surrounding a context should include targeted reading materials and analysis in each lesson, an introduction facilitating students' engagement, and related teaching activities. Also, in the evaluation study of LitLinker prototype, three teachers (I1, I2, 15) indicated that the system outputs should be more detailed and reduce human effort in modifying them for the later concrete plans for each lesson. \"The overall structure of the output is good, but I hope it can be more detailed; for example, providing more in-class and extracurricular activities related to the theme, so we can use them directly\" (I1). Therefore, we incorporated recommendations for literature and interdisciplinary course activities in the refined LitLinker.\nFinding 5: Teachers are concerned the quality and reliability of the content purely generated by LLMs. In the evaluation study with six teachers (11-6), our prototype generated traditional subject-related contexts using the LLM with specific templates and cognitive backgrounds of elementary students, without fine-tuning or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Three teachers (14, 15, 16) expressed concerns about the quality of the LLM-generated content. \"The content generated for the art subject is quite repetitive\u201d (I5). \u201cWe need to establish a dedicated article database for science as well, since many of our articles are highly relevant to science\u201d (14).\nFinding 6: Teachers suggest six metrics for evaluating the outcome of interdisciplinary literature lesson plan. As established by the team of E1-E7, the metrics are:\n\u2022 Appropriateness of Context\nContent Alignment: Does the context accurately cover the content of the selected materials?\nInternal Logic: Is there a logical connection between the context and the selected materials?\n\u2022 Alignment with Educational Objectives\nCurriculum Standards: Does the content comply with national curriculum standards and teaching guidelines?\nSubject Goals: Does it help achieve specific goals of language education, such as reading comprehension and writing skills?\n\u2022 Depth of Integration\nSubject Integration: Does it effectively integrate knowledge from different subjects?\nKnowledge Transfer: Does it promote the application of language arts knowledge in other subject contexts?"}, {"title": "3.3 Design Principles", "content": "Based on the findings from our design process and related literature, we derive four design principles of LitLinker.\nDP1: LitLinker should provide step-by-step support that aligns with teachers' habitual practices in interdisciplinary context ideation. Tailoring the assistance to users' habitual practices (e.g., active students' behaviors or teachers' behaviors) is a commonly enacted principle in previous interactive systems in educational scenarios [17, 19, 36]. In the task of interdisciplinary context ideation, as revealed in Finding 1, LitLinker should support step-by-step context ideation through reverse thinking, which is a habitual practice of our teachers. In this practice, as E1 shared, teachers take various roles to analyze the potential contexts (we note this role as Context Analyst), analyze the texts in the reading materials, connect them to the contexts, and discuss the approaches (Text Analyst and Text Reviewer). After that, teachers try to summarize the contexts and associated reading materials into an actionable"}, {"title": "4 Design of LitLinker", "content": "Based on the identified design principles, we introduce LitLinker, a human-AI collaborative system to support elementary school literature teachers in ideating interdisciplinary contexts. LitLinker not only facilitates teachers' ability to explore various contexts and reading materials but also delivers structured outputs derived from this exploration process and the teachers' thought processes. Inspired by prior research [68] and tailored to our interdisciplinary context exploration scenario, the primary interface of LitLinker consists of three parts: Contexts Exploration View, Texts Exploration View, and Collection View. After confirming the subjects and importing the reading materials, the system aligns with the user's habitual thinking process by selecting or specifying potentially related interdisciplinary contexts within Context Exploration View (DP1). Based on the selected context, the system enables multi-text-driven exploration (DP2). Specifically, LitLinker extracts connections between the context and literacy elements, displaying specific details in either Context Exploration View or Texts Exploration View, decided upon whether they are context-oriented or text-oriented. In Texts Exploration View, users can conduct in-depth analyses of individual texts and perform pairwise comparisons of any selected texts. In these two exploration processes, users have the opportunity to chat with the LLM at any time and modify the analyses provided by the system (DP4). Users can add analyzed themes and corresponding texts into the collection, allowing the system to generate structured ideation outcomes based on their selections (DP3). In LitLinker, all generated content relies on a context database, prompt templates, and generation guidelines (DP3, DP4). In the following subsections, we will describe how users can interact with LitLinker and the detailed design and implementation of LitLinker.\n4.1 LitLinker Interface and Interaction Design\nTo initiate the exploration process, users are required to select the interdisciplinary subjects and reading materials they wish to explore (Figure 1 A). By clicking the \"Collapse Config Panel\" button (Figure 1 A turned into \"Open config panel\" at the top of the page after clicking on), users confirm their settings, which subsequently expands Contexts Exploration View. Upon clicking the \u201cGenerate Recommended Contexts\u201d button, LitLinker displays a series of context cards (B), each containing the context title, the titles of the most relevant reading materials, the original context from Context Pool (see Section 4.2.2), and a detailed description of the context. Users may click the \"Find\" button on any context card of interest to further explore and edit the description of the context, allowing them to ask the LLM any questions (D) related to the theme and its connections (e.g., relate this context to additional musical works?) to aid in understanding and exploration. The description becomes editable, enabling users to reconstruct it based on the LLM's responses. Users can also click \"Star\" to favorite a context and click the \"Right Arrow\" to specify the theme associated with texts in Texts Exploration View (B). If users are dissatisfied with a context, they have the option to click the \"Delete\" button to remove it. Users can click \"Manually Add Context\" to provide the title and background of a context in a pop-up window (C), allowing LitLinker to tailor a suitable context based on the information provided.\nThe middle part of the page is designated as Texts Exploration View (Figure 1), which facilitates a comprehensive examination of the interrelationships among various reading materials and specified contexts. Texts that are most relevant to the selected context are displayed at the top in Texts Exploration View, with each reading material accompanied by the analysis. This analysis encompasses the relationships among sentences, paragraphs, and the context (i.e., in-depth single-text analysis). To further support user exploration, inspired by [58] and the workflow of the teachers, additional ratings and critical recommendations are provided for LLM-generated analysis. Similar to Contexts View, users have the option to click the \"Find\" button on any card (E) to ask the LLM any questions about the contexts related to the reading material (e.g., Can you"}, {"title": "4.2 Implementation of the System", "content": "Inspired by [27, 58], LitLinker aligns its behavior with teachers' habitual practices in interdisciplinary ideation (DP1). We designed an LLM-based multi-agent system to simulate human collaboration. Following the multi-agent collaborative framework by Hong et al. [26], we decompose the task into multiple steps, allowing agents to use tools when necessary and interact with the user for feedback.\nAlso, the prompt design follows the Co-Star framework [43] to optimize outputs. The architecture of our workflow is illustrated in Figure 3, which will be discussed in Section 4.2.1. The effectiveness of the content generated through this architecture relies on a comprehensive Context Pool (DP4) and carefully designed prompts (DP2, DP3), which will be introduced in Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.2.3, respectively.\n4.2.1 Architecture of LitLinker. In line with the teachers' habitual practices and DPs, we simulate four roles (DP1) that participate in the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts: Context Analyst (DP2), Text Analyst (DP2), Text Reviewer (DP2, DP4), and Context Summarizer (DP3). To facilitate their collaboration, similar to MetaGPT [26], we enable these agents to remember, think (i.e., determine subsequent actions based on observations), act (i.e., utilize tools and communicate with one another), and, crucially, observe user behavior through the interface to respond appropriately. Each role is equipped with the GLM4 model as its \"brain.\" Before the application is implemented, all original contexts and reading materials are embedded using the Zhipu embedding-3 model\u2075. The texts and embedding arrays are stored in the database. For contexts imported by users, LitLinker will complete this embedding process in real-time.\nContext Analyst acts as a \"teacher with expertise across various disciplines.\" When a user clicks \u201cGenerate Recommended Contexts,\u201d it retrieves background information of the original contexts that are most relevant to the reading materials from the database. For each context, Context Analyst conducts an analysis based on all associated reading materials and generates a detailed description of the context. The Context Analyst's memory continuously retains the texts and analyzes contexts, similar to the role of a teacher. When a user initiates a request in \"Find\" mode, Context Analyst is tasked with providing detailed information related to the context.\nText Analyst acts as an \"active-minded literature teacher.\" When a user requests an analysis of texts based on the selected context, Context Analyst provides Text Analyst with the details of the selected context. Initially, Text Analyst retrieves the most relevant texts. Subsequently, Text Analyst conducts a thorough analysis of each text individually, producing an in-depth single-text analysis. Furthermore, Text Analyst responds to users' inquiries related to the text.\nText Reviewer acts as a \"conservative and experienced literature teacher.\" When Text Analyst generates an analysis, it seeks Text Reviewer's opinion, which entails Text Reviewer assessing the relevance and accuracy of the analysis based on the reading material and the selected context, providing evaluative information to the user. This additional review process provides users with critical information and corrects potential inaccuracies in the RAG.\nContext Summarizer acts as a \"literature teacher skilled in summarization,\" responsible for integrating the context with synthesizing contextual information with selected reading materials from the collection. It delivers structured outputs step-by-step in"}, {"title": "5 Experiment I: Within-subject study", "content": "We evaluate LitLinker via two experiments.

This sample size follows the practices of previous work that evaluates systems for supporting ideation and education, such as CreativeConnect (N = 16) [10], AngleKindling (N = 12) [47], DiaryHelper (N = 12) [33], and Lesson Planner (N = 12) [17]. We also calculated the required sample size with G* Power to conduct Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests that compare measures in LitLinker and baseline conditions. With Tails = Two (can not tell in advance which of the two measures is larger), Parent distribution = Normal (default), Effect size = 0.80 (calculated as Cohen's d [11], large effect), a err prob = 0.05 (default), and power (1 - \u03b2 err prob) = 0.8 (an acceptable threshold), the output recommended smallest sample size is 15. Five participants, including two third-year undergraduate and three graduate students, major in the fields related to computer science (CS). They could provide feedback from those who know about the techniques used in LitLinker, and they were capable of our ideation tasks as they all learned Chinese literature in elementary schools. The other eleven participants are all graduate students majoring in education-related fields. All of them are teachers in training, while P2, P4, and P9 have teaching experience. The others are pre-service teachers.. All participants expressed their interest in utilizing web resources and AI-assisted tools to design interdisciplinary contexts (Mean = 4.62, SD = 0.48; 1 - no interest at all, 5 - very interest in).

Each participant completed one interdisciplinary exploration task with LitLinker and the other with a baseline setup.\n5.2.1 Baseline Condition and LitLinker Condition. The baseline system is the LLM web application, which employs the Zhipu LLM model, the same model implemented in LitLinker.

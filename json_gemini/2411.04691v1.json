Particularly in digital health, smartphones facilitate the tracking of health-related behaviors and contexts, contributing significantly to digital phenotyping, a process where data from digital interactions is analyzed to infer behaviors and assess mental health. Traditional methods process raw sensor data into information features for statistical and machine learning analyses. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that systematically converts smartphone-collected data into structured, chronological narratives. The AWARE Narrator translates quantitative smartphone sensing data into English language descriptions, forming comprehensive narratives of an individual's activities. We apply the framework to the data collected from university students over a week, demonstrating the potential of utilizing the narratives to summarize individual behavior, and analyzing psychological states by leveraging large language models.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The modern smartphone contains an array of sensors that enable the sensing and tracking of various phone states, uses and properties. These sensors include accelerometer, GPS/geolocation, Bluetooth, communication logs (phone and SMS), application usage and keyboard activity. Given their various sensors and the opportunities to utilise them, smartphones, the Swiss army knives of digital technology, have proven to be valuable personal sensing devices, with applications in domains such as health, education and leisure.\nGiven their potential to track various health-related behaviours and user contexts, as well as the emergence of health apps, smartphone sensing has become a pivotal topic in digital health. This is particularly the case in digital mental health, where the concept of digital phenotyping has emerged in recent years. In short, digital phenotyping espouses the idea that the data created from our use of and interaction with digital technologies, such as smartphones, can be mined or analysed to infer behaviours and, ultimately assess mental health [1, 2]. The focus of our work in this paper is on leveraging smartphone sensing as a tool in psychology and mental health.\nOnce raw sensor data is collected, it is typically processed into information features that can be used in statistical analyses and machine learning model construction. For instance, from raw geolocation data one, features such as total distance travelled or time spent at the most visited location can be derived. In this paper, however, we propose a novel approach to analyze smartphone sensing data. The core idea is to translate quantitative smartphone sensing"}, {"title": "2 AWARE Smartphone Sensing Data", "content": "To illustrate the core ideas of this paper and establish a framework for translating smartphone sensing data into English sensing statements, we utilize the AWARE smartphone sensing platform, in particular, the AWARE-Light app variant [9].\nThe AWARE platform is a versatile and powerful tool designed to harness the sensor capabilities of modern smart- phones for both research and practical applications. By integrating a variety of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS, and light sensors, AWARE enables the continuous and real-time collection of data related to physical activities, environmental conditions, and user interactions. The data gathered from these sensors is stored in a MySQL database, with each sensor's data being stored into its own table. This structured data can then be analyzed and interpreted to yield deep insights into user behavior and environmental contexts.\nAWARE's open-source nature, along with its robust API and plugin architecture, offers researchers and developers significant flexibility to customize and extend its functionalities to suit specific needs. This adaptability makes AWARE an invaluable resource across a wide range of disciplines, including health monitoring, smart environments, and urban computing, thereby fostering innovation and collaboration within the global research community.\nWe will now list all the AWARE sensors included in our conversion framework and provide a description of the fields associated with each sensor. It is important to note that, in addition to the specific fields detailed for each sensor, every sensor table includes three standard columns: row id, timestamp, and device ID."}, {"title": "3 AWARE Narrator: Converting AWARE Tabular Data to Narratives", "content": "In this section, we outline the process of converting tabular data into descriptive sensing statements and utilizing these sensing statements with large language models (LLMs). We begin by collecting smartphone sensor data through AWARE-Light, which is then transformed into daily sensing statements using the AWARE Narrator framework\u00b9. These daily sensing statements are subsequently summarized into weekly abstractions to gain psychological insights or analyze behavioral patterns based on daily activities, as depicted in Figure 1."}, {"title": "3.1 Converting AWARE tabular data to descriptive rows", "content": "We have developed a Python script that extracts records from each of the tables mentioned in the previous section, converts each record into an English description, and sorts all the descriptions in chronological order, from earliest to latest. Each line of output is in the following format:"}, {"title": "3.2 Analysis of the sensing statements", "content": "Given a complete set of smartphone sensing data statements for a specific period, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) could be used to summarize the data and extract meaningful insights. For this purpose, we employed the Gemini 1.5-flash, GPT-40, and Claude Haiku models to perform analysis tasks.\nOur first task involves prompting the LLMs with the data and asking them to generate a narrative summary that captures a set of sensing statements for a given day. This summary can serve as a daily report of the individual's activities, which can be valuable for assessing daily events and monitoring mood. When extended over a longer timeline, these narratives can be collected to analyze weekly or monthly changes in behavior and well-being.\nWe also posed specific questions to the LLMs to extract answers from the sets of sensing statements. These questions can be divided into two categories: factual and analytical. Factual questions focus on descriptive information that"}, {"title": "4 Case Study", "content": "In this section, we apply AWARE Narrator and LLM queries to some data that was obtained from one of the digital phenotyping studies we have run using AWARE-Light, namely StudentSense [3]. The StudentSense study collected data from university students for 17 weeks during an Australian summer semester at the University of X. Data was collected for the following sensors: application usage, battery, Bluetooth, calls, keyboard usage, geolocation, SMS messages, screen status and WiFi.\nFor demonstration purposes, we have selected one of the participants with particularly comprehensive smartphone sensing data and focused on one week of the data during which they were tracked. At the end of the week, psychological measures were administered including the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) [5] and the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (I-PANAS-SF) [8]. The sequence of prompts we experimented with to generate summaries and derive insights from the data at both daily and weekly levels are presented."}, {"title": "4.1 Querying the Sets of Narrative Sensing Statements", "content": "To briefly demonstrate how answers can be extracted from the narrative information, we provide a few simple examples using GPT-40, queried from one day's data of the participant. The first query addresses phone usage (Figure 4), the second query explores the behavior of the smartphone user (Figure 5), and the third query examines the psychology of the smartphone user (Figure 6). These three examples illustrate how general questions applied to such data can yield meaningful insights.\nExample I (Figure 4) explores the relationship between the participant and the smartphone. This example can serve as a summary for smartphone users, offering daily or periodic reports on their smartphone usage and recommendations for healthier usage habits. Leveraging the LLMs, the smartphone usage data can reveal problematic behaviors such as excessive use, smartphone addiction, and nomophobia (\u201cNoMobilePhobia\"). In addition, the example captures and classifies application usage, a task that would be challenging to perform manually with traditional analysis methods. Translating the tabular form of application usage into textual descriptions makes it clearer for LLMs to analyze, with application names and functionalities. Such a summary of application usage provides comprehensive insights into the user's smartphone behaviors and how they interact with various information sources.\nExample II (Figure 5) demonstrates how the collected smartphone sensor data can be used in narrative form to extract behavioural insights. Specifically, using evidence from various perspectives such as movement patterns, application usage, communication patterns, activity patterns, and connectivity via WiFi and networks, the large language models speculate on the personality and behavior based on descriptive data. We confirm the validity of information including frequent visits, used applications, and activity timelines. Although the analysis does not speculate on personality traits like the Big Five Personality with the open-ended question asked, it can reveal how daily smartphone interactions may reflect personality and psychological states. This understanding can help individuals comprehend how their smartphone usage impacts their psychological well-being.\nExample III (Figure 6) presents the output from LLMs analyzing psychological insights into the participant. The summary suggests that the participant had a \u201chighly connected, academically focused\" routine and \"relied heavily on technology with a structured yet flexible routine.\" This conclusion is based on the participant's academic activity engagement, social interactions, and location data from their smartphone. The LLMs also observe minor details, such as staying up late, time management habits, and constant app switching. These insights, which are difficult to obtain from raw numeric data, are valuable for analyzing psychological well-being and mental health. Previous studies indicate that psychological states can be reflected in smartphone usage patterns, such as anxiety shown by frequent app switching or depression indicated by keystroke patterns. The AWARE Narrator framework captures and analyzes these minor behavioral details more effectively than traditional feature generation methods.\""}, {"title": "4.2 Applying LLMs to the Narrative Data for the Prediction of Psychometric Results", "content": "Regarding the psychological insights question, whether the information provided by the LLM ultimately provides truthful/valid responses is an open question beyond the scope of this paper and would require validation in terms of work that establishes associations between digital footprint data and psychological states. Furthermore, how such psychological summaries could be used by relevant practitioners remains another interesting consideration."}, {"title": "5 Future Work and Conclusion", "content": "Our exploratory demonstrations with the LLMs were confined to zero-shot prompts. Future work on this idea should explore multi-shot prompting. One approach would be to include some psychological measures of interest as output for each shot input (i.e., set of sensor descriptions). For example, the set of sensor descriptions for each of several\ninformation and environments to which the smartphone user is exposed. It provides a novel way to interpret classical tabular data in digital phenotyping, offering insights into human behaviors and psychological states."}]}

The chapter calls for proactive measures to incentivize BCR adoption, streamline approval processes, and promote more innovative approaches, ensuring BCRs remain a robust mechanism for global data protection and compliance.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "International data transfers across multiple sectors of economic and social life pose a substantial challenge for global organizations, particularly in the context of stringent data protection regulations such as the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This challenge is amplified and especially acute when it comes to sensitive health data transfers and the increased adoption of AI technologies, given the complexities and heightened privacy concerns associated with this type of personal information.\nAl plays a crucial role in precision medicine by analyzing vast health data sets to create personalized treatments, necessitating secure international health data transfers. For example, it identifies genetic mutations for tailored therapies, predicts treatment responses based on comprehensive data, accelerates drug discovery for rare diseases through global collaboration, enhances medical imaging for optimal treatment paths, and supports real-time monitoring for conditions like diabetes. These applications underscore Al's potential in delivering personalized healthcare while highlighting the need for secure global data sharing to facilitate research and innovation.\nUnder Chapter 5 of the GDPR, there are several data transfer mechanisms, and it is essential to assess the specifics of each data transfer and choose the most suitable GDPR-compliant method to safeguard personal data during any international transfer of such data. In this chapter, our primary emphasis will be on data transfers relying on Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) as a mechanism, particularly in the context of genomics and health-related data transfers.\nBCRs exhibit a certain degree of flexibility in comparison with other mechanisms. In particular, they can be individually tailored to cover specific data types. When it comes to the transfer of health and genomic data to third countries or international organizations, BCRs have limited applicability within the genomics community. The primary challenge in genomics data sharing, therefore, lies not within organizations but between them. This is important because genomics in healthcare or research relies on collaboration among interdependent organizations rather than global-spanning corporations. Nevertheless, BCRs remain valuable tools for organizations positioned to leverage them. Moreover, some organizations have explored the potential of establishing subsidiaries of non-European Economic Area (EEA) based organizations within the EEA to capitalize on the flexibility offered by BCRs.\nIn November 2022, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) issued preliminary guidance, namely EDPB Recommendations 1/2022, on BCRs for data transfers. These recommendations were in alignment with the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) Schrems II"}, {"title": "2 International Data Transfer Mechanisms under the GDPR", "content": "In this section, we will provide an overview of the various data transfer mechanisms available under the GDPR. These mechanisms can be visualized as a three-tiered pyramid, with BCRs occupying the second level, immediately following so-called adequacy decisions. The tools for facilitating the secure international transfer of personal data from the EEA are detailed in Chapter V of the GDPR. These methods include:\nTransfers based on an \u2018adequacy decision' by the European Commission (Art. 45\nGDPR): This allows data to be transferred to countries or regions that the European Commission deems to provide an adequate level of data protection. For instance, if the European Commission determines that Country X has data protection regulations and practices in place that closely align with the GDPR's high standards and principles,"}, {"title": "3 Key Provisions of BCRs and the Approval Procedure", "content": "In the following, we focus more specifically on BCRs as a mechanism. BCRs are an innovative and comprehensive data transfer mechanism developed collaboratively by the European Commission, member state data protection authorities, and multinational businesses. They are essentially data protection policies adopted by EEA companies for transferring personal data outside the EEA within their group of undertakings or enterprises when they are engaged in a joint economic activity. As such, BCRs facilitate responsible cross-border data flows within a corporate group, serving as a so-called \u2018gold standard' for privacy and data protection management programs within a shared organizational group.\nOrganizations, whether acting as controllers or processors, that have implemented BCRs report various business benefits and gain internal and external recognition for their \u2018BCR status.' This recognition acts as a 'soft certification,' showcasing an organization's commitment to and compliance with data privacy regulations to both business partners and individuals. Furthermore, BCRs are recognized as a valid international data transfer mechanism by several other non-EEA member countries, including the U.K., Singapore, Brazil, and South Africa.\nThese rules encompass all general data protection principles and enforceable rights to ensure adequate safeguards for data transfers. They are legally binding and must be upheld by every member of the group involved. As such, they serve as a fundamental baseline framework for multinational organizations involved in international data transfers, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding individuals' personal data. To achieve this goal, BCRs must meet the following specific criteria:\nLegally Binding and Universal Applicability: BCRs are legally binding (both internally and externally) and universally applicable, extending to every member concerned within a group of undertakings or enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and this also includes employees with access to personal data."}, {"title": "4 EDPB Recommendation", "content": "In its December 2022 Recommendation, the EDPB provided draft guidance with updated interpretations and requirements for the BCRs transfer mechanism. Regrettably, however, the EDPB missed an important and valuable opportunity to comprehensively address BCRs with a strategic and forward-thinking approach, preventing the enhancement of this essential transfer mechanism into a more scalable and globally applicable tool for sustainable international data transfers.\nIn light of the GDPR and recent legal developments, along with the evolving landscape of international data transfers in Europe and beyond, it is imperative to reevaluate and improve BCRs. To effectively harness the potential of BCRs, policymakers should consider the following measure and steps:\nAdvocate for, incentivize, and recognize their distinctive characteristics. It is essential for the European Commission, the EDPB, and other supervisory authorities to take proactive measures to encourage more widespread BCR adoption, streamlining the process and making it more appealing for corporate groups of all sizes to attain BCR approval. A BCR differs significantly from a conventional contract, in the sense that it more closely resembles an enforceable corporate code of conduct or a third-party certified accountability framework. As such, it serves as clear evidence of accountability and the presence of a comprehensive data privacy management program across the whole corporate group and all its related entities.\nStreamline and transform the approval process. The BCR requirements should not impose stricter conditions than those governing other transfer mechanisms, such as the SCCs. Instead, they should be tailored to the unique nature of this mechanism. BCRs should be designed to accommodate organizations of all sizes and corporate structures, ensuring scalability and configurability. In this respect, Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) play a crucial role in this process by minimizing administrative burdens and timelines associated with BCR applications while establishing transparent and practical criteria. This approach fosters broader adoption by making BCRs adaptable to the diverse needs of organizations.\nPromote a consistent risk-based approach to risk assessments. BCRs embody a firm dedication to maintaining a uniform standard of privacy protection throughout an entire"}, {"title": "5 Recommended International Standards and Frameworks to Manage Data Security and AI-related Risks", "content": "BCRs are a vital management tool for addressing significant legal challenges related to data transfers. Traditionally, BCRs have focused on legal compliance and risk mitigation. However, it is crucial to recognize that BCRs must be continually updated to address emerging risks, especially with the advent of new technologies such as AI.\nAl systems present several risks, particularly concerning trust and privacy across various domains. One significant threat is \u2018training data poisoning,' where adversaries insert malicious data into training sets to manipulate AI models. This can result in model degradation, bias, security vulnerabilities, and privacy violations. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to implement measures such as data quality assurance, adversarial training, transparency, accountability, and regulatory compliance.\nAnother significant risk is \u2018data leakage' in federated learning, where sensitive information from decentralized devices can unintentionally leak due to compromised security protocols, insufficient encryption, or data transmission vulnerabilities.

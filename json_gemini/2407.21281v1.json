For example,\nit identifies genetic mutations for tailored therapies, predicts treatment responses based on\ncomprehensive data, accelerates drug discovery for rare diseases through global collaboration,\nenhances medical imaging for optimal treatment paths, and supports real-time monitoring for\nconditions like diabetes. These applications underscore Al's potential in delivering\npersonalized healthcare while highlighting the need for secure global data sharing to facilitate\nresearch and innovation.3\nUnder Chapter 5 of the GDPR, there are several data transfer mechanisms, and it is\nessential to assess the specifics of each data transfer and choose the most suitable GDPR-\ncompliant method to safeguard personal data during any international transfer of such data.4 In\nthis chapter, our primary emphasis will be on data transfers relying on Binding Corporate Rules\n(BCRs) as a mechanism, particularly in the context of genomics and health-related data\ntransfers.\nBCRs exhibit a certain degree of flexibility in comparison with other mechanisms. In\nparticular, they can be individually tailored to cover specific data types. When it comes to the\ntransfer of health and genomic data to third countries or international organizations, BCRs have\nlimited applicability within the genomics community. The primary challenge in genomics data\nsharing, therefore, lies not within organizations but between them. This is important because\ngenomics in healthcare or research relies on collaboration among interdependent organizations\nrather than global-spanning corporations. Nevertheless, BCRs remain valuable tools for\norganizations positioned to leverage them. Moreover, some organizations have explored the\npotential of establishing subsidiaries of non-European Economic Area (EEA) based\norganizations within the EEA to capitalize on the flexibility offered by BCRs.5\nIn November 2022, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) issued preliminary\nguidance, namely EDPB Recommendations 1/2022, on BCRs for data transfers. These\nrecommendations were in alignment with the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) Schrems II"}, {"title": "2 International Data Transfer Mechanisms under the GDPR", "content": "In this section, we will provide an overview of the various data transfer mechanisms available\nunder the GDPR. These mechanisms can be visualized as a three-tiered pyramid, with BCRs\noccupying the second level, immediately following so-called adequacy decisions. The tools for\nfacilitating the secure international transfer of personal data from the EEA are detailed in\nChapter V of the GDPR. These methods include:9\n1.\tTransfers based on an \u2018adequacy decision' by the European Commission (Art. 45\nGDPR): This allows data to be transferred to countries or regions that the European\nCommission deems to provide an adequate level of data protection. For instance, if the\nEuropean Commission determines that Country X has data protection regulations and\npractices in place that closely align with the GDPR's high standards and principles,"}, {"title": "3 Key Provisions of BCRs and the Approval Procedure", "content": "In the following, we focus more specifically on BCRs as a mechanism. BCRs are an innovative\nand comprehensive data transfer mechanism developed collaboratively by the European\nCommission, member state data protection authorities, and multinational businesses.22 They\nare essentially data protection policies adopted by EEA companies for transferring personal\ndata outside the EEA within their group of undertakings or enterprises23 when they are engaged\nin a joint economic activity.24 As such, BCRs facilitate responsible cross-border data flows\nwithin a corporate group, serving as a so-called \u2018gold standard' for privacy and data protection\nmanagement programs within a shared organizational group.25\nOrganizations, whether acting as controllers or processors, 26 that have implemented\nBCRs report various business benefits and gain internal and external recognition for their \u2018BCR\nstatus.' This recognition acts as a 'soft certification,' showcasing an organization's\ncommitment to and compliance with data privacy regulations to both business partners and\nindividuals. Furthermore, BCRs are recognized as a valid international data transfer mechanism\nby several other non-EEA member countries, including the U.K., Singapore, Brazil, and South\nAfrica. 27\nThese rules encompass all general data protection principles and enforceable rights to\nensure adequate safeguards for data transfers. They are legally binding and must be upheld by\nevery member of the group involved.28 As such, they serve as a fundamental baseline\nframework for multinational organizations involved in international data transfers, ensuring\ncompliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding individuals' personal data. To\nachieve this goal, BCRs must meet the following specific criteria:29\n1.\tLegally Binding and Universal Applicability: BCRs are legally binding (both\ninternally and externally) and universally applicable, extending to every member\nconcerned within a group of undertakings or enterprises engaged in a joint economic\nactivity, and this also includes employees with access to personal data."}, {"title": "4 EDPB Recommendation", "content": "In its December 2022 Recommendation, the EDPB provided draft guidance with updated\ninterpretations and requirements for the BCRs transfer mechanism. Regrettably, however, the\nEDPB missed an important and valuable opportunity to comprehensively address BCRs with\na strategic and forward-thinking approach, preventing the enhancement of this essential\ntransfer mechanism into a more scalable and globally applicable tool for sustainable\ninternational data transfers.\nIn light of the GDPR and recent legal developments, along with the evolving landscape\nof international data transfers in Europe and beyond, it is imperative to reevaluate and improve\nBCRs. To effectively harness the potential of BCRs, policymakers should consider the\nfollowing measure and steps:36\n1.\tAdvocate for, incentivize, and recognize their distinctive characteristics. It is\nessential for the European Commission, the EDPB, and other supervisory authorities to\ntake proactive measures to encourage more widespread BCR adoption, streamlining the\nprocess and making it more appealing for corporate groups of all sizes to attain BCR\napproval. A BCR differs significantly from a conventional contract, in the sense that it\nmore closely resembles an enforceable corporate code of conduct or a third-party\ncertified accountability framework. As such, it serves as clear evidence of accountability\nand the presence of a comprehensive data privacy management program across the\nwhole corporate group and all its related entities.37\n2.\tStreamline and transform the approval process. The BCR requirements should not\nimpose stricter conditions than those governing other transfer mechanisms, such as the\nSCCs.38 Instead, they should be tailored to the unique nature of this mechanism. BCRs\nshould be designed to accommodate organizations of all sizes and corporate structures,\nensuring scalability and configurability. In this respect, Data Protection Authorities\n(DPAs) play a crucial role in this process by minimizing administrative burdens and\ntimelines associated with BCR applications while establishing transparent and practical\ncriteria. This approach fosters broader adoption by making BCRs adaptable to the\ndiverse needs of organizations.39\n3.\tPromote a consistent risk-based approach to risk assessments.

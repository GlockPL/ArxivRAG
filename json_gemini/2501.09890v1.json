{"title": "Exploring the Implementation of AI in Early Onset Interviews to Help Mitigate Bias", "authors": ["Nishka Lal", "Omar Benkraouda"], "abstract": "This paper investigates the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in early-stage\nrecruitment interviews in order to reduce inherent bias, specifically sentiment bias. Traditional\ninterviewers are often subject to several biases, including interviewer bias, social desirability\neffects, and even confirmation bias. In turn, this leads to non-inclusive hiring practices, and a less\ndiverse workforce. This study further analyzes various AI interventions that are present in the\nmarketplace today such as multimodal platforms and interactive candidate assessment tools in\norder to gauge the current market usage of AI in early-stage recruitment. However, this paper\naims to use a unique AI system that was developed to transcribe and analyze interview dynamics,\nwhich emphasize skill and knowledge over emotional sentiments. Results indicate that AI\neffectively minimizes sentiment-driven biases by 41.2%, suggesting its revolutionizing power in\ncompanies' recruitment processes for improved equity and efficiency.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Though it is a concept that began seemingly a century ago, interviews have become an\nessential part of the recruitment process. What started as simply as Thomas Edison's filtering\nmechanism through a lack of worthy college students, has now become the primary part of every\ncompanies' HR strategy. With that being said, over the years, there have been constant points\nupheld about the validity of these interviews, and the implicit biases that are brought with them."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "Previously, there have been quite a few companies that have attempted to use AI to\nmitigate biases within the recruitment process. For starters, there was an innovative project\nstarted in collaboration with Eni, in which an interface reminiscent of popular social media\nplatforms was provided to the interviewees as an attempt for users to contribute content through\nvarious multitudes including text, images, and video [18]. This in turn allows for interviewer bias\nto be less considered because the median of communication is not just tonal and attitude\nresponse, but instead a holistic approach of attempting to understand their overall fit to the\ncompany standards. Instead of just one call, it is a series of forums that allow for the candidate to\nbe thoroughly understood, attempting to avoid the first impression in interviewer bias. Another\nexample of AI being used to mitigate bias and time spent in the recruitment process is when\nUnilever\u00b9 partnered with Pymetrics\u00b2 to create an online platform that uses a candidate's talent,\nlogic, and reasoning, acquired through a neuroscience game event, to screen applicants [13].\nSimilar to the system Eni has incorporated, this type of system allows skill analysis that is much\nmore holistic than a first impression. It specifically hones in on the candidate's strengths and\nweaknesses in a more quantitative way, allowing for their characteristics to be matched against"}, {"title": "Gap/New Solution", "content": "With all that being said, there were not many examples of companies that attempted to\nmediate the concern of bias in AI by mixing different solutions into one place, enhancing both\nuser experience and comfort. While some of the solutions had just games to consider a different\nside of the candidate's skills, others analyzed wording on the CV in order to take away initial\nbias from the interviews."}, {"title": "AI Developmental Process", "content": "Before understanding the specific mechanisms that will be used to test if my Al system\ncan accurately reduce levels of bias in early-onset HR interviews, it is important to outline the\nprocedure that was utilized to create the AI interview-bot."}, {"title": "Text-to-Speech Response Delivery", "content": "After the transcription, the resulting text is then sent to the OpenAI ChatGPT model [15],\nwhich uses the history of the textual conversation and generates a relevant response. This is done\nthrough processing the user's input along with accumulated messages on the JSON file, so that\nnot only is the immediate text being reviewed, but so is the background of the said interview.\nThis feature enables the conversation to be more relatable and engaging akin to a face-to-face,\ninstead of disconnected from past talking points. The assistant's response is then converted back\nto audio form through ElevenLabs text-to-speech APIand is streamed back to the user [8]. This is\nsimilar to an actual interview, such that when the user says something, the application responds\nto it, enabling an interactive experience."}, {"title": "Dynamic Sentiment and Reset Features", "content": "Apart from just the conversational functionality, this AI application also incorporates a\nsentiment analysis feature, which is accessible through the /analyze endpoint. This endpoint"}, {"title": "Data Collection", "content": "However, the creation of the model was simply the first step. After the model was\ndeveloped and integrated into the website that I created using Wix, I ran tests on the model in\norder to gauge a rating scale from the AI itself. Nevertheless, before the data is collected, it is\nimportant to define what each of the knowledge levels entail. For the purposes of my study, the\nratings are as follows:\nUninformed (1): Has no knowledge of the topic and does not recognize its relevance,\nsignificance, or application.\nBasic Awareness (2): Knows a few terms or steps to begin the process, but lacks\nunderstanding. Cannot explain the topic in any meaningful way.\nSuperficial Understanding (3): Has a general understanding of the topic but lacks depth\nregarding the situation or strategy.\nCompetent (4): Has a solid understanding of the material and discusses the materials,\nhowever not confidently and immediately."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "After the data was collected, I deemed to delineate a pattern among my findings.\nTherefore, I began by analyzing the candidate data for positive sentiments. First, I found the\naverage of the Al ratings was 3.22 and the average of the human ratings which was 3.84. After\nthis, I found the difference between the human and AI averages and found that the difference was\n0.62. I repeated the aforementioned process to find the difference in negative sentiment, which\nwas -1.28."}, {"title": "Findings", "content": "From the revelations above, we can deduce that since the difference for positive\nsentiment was higher, humans tend to favor candidates with positive sentiment more than AI,\nrating them on an average 0.62 points higher. Furthermore, by looking at the negative bias's high\nnegative difference, we can deduce that humans rate candidates with negative sentiment an\naverage of 1.28 points lower than Al does. Overall, this bias is 2.06 points, highlighting a\nsignificant tendency for humans to exhibit a more favorable bias towards candidates with"}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Nevertheless, while this study has significant additions to the field, there are some minor\naspects of this study's process that should be kept in mind. For starters, the methodology section\nonly utilizes 10 test cases since each of them required in depth personal involvement, which may\nnot be a significant amount of data to draw a long-standing conclusion from. Nevertheless, I did\naim to make the candidates inclusive of the various types of people in the interviewing situation,\nbut it might be beneficial in a further study to have more test cases run using the AI.\nFurthermore, using more human interviewers to analyze the interviews might also strengthen the\nresults that were received from the study. Additionally, since this study focuses solely on the\nimportance of knowledge over emotion, these results would not be as effective for jobs that rely\nheavily on emotional skills. Instead, this study furthers the idea that AI stands as an effective\nreplacement for specifically knowledge/skill based interviews to produce an unbiased\nrecommendation to enhance company productivity."}, {"title": "Future Implications", "content": "Furthering upon this research, researchers can expound on using AI to not only mitigate\nbias in the knowledge/skills section of the interview, but also utilizing its functionalities to\nminimize gender or even race bias in the emotional aspects as well.

As aforementioned, traditional interview\nprocesses are often influenced by interviewer bias, social desirability effects, and confirmation\nbias, which can lead to detrimental effects such as less inclusive hiring. This study thereby\nreviews various AI solutions currently available, including multimodal platforms and interactive\ncandidate assessments, to assess the extent to which AI has been integrated in the recruitment\ndomain. Furthermore, this research tested a novel AI system designed to transcribe and evaluate\ninterview dynamics, prioritizing objective assessment of skills and knowledge in comparison to\nemotional cues. The results demonstrate a 41.2% reduction in sentiment-driven biases,\nunderscoring Al's potential to transform the environment by enhancing efficiency and fairness."}]}

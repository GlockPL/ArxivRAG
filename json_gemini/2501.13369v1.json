With\nthe lowest Testing RMSE (0.23) and flawless R2 scores (1.00), CatBoost performs better than\nother models, demonstrating its greater accuracy and generalization which is cross validated using\na nested cross validation approach. NowCast Concentration and Raw Concentration are the most\nimportant elements influencing AQI values, according to SHAP research, which shows that the\nmachine learning results are highly accurate. Their significance as major contributors to air\npollution is highlighted by the fact that high values of these characteristics significantly raise the\nAQI. This study investigates the Hydrogen-Alpha (HA) biodegradable filter as a novel way to\nreduce the related health hazards. With removal efficiency of more than 98% for PM2.5 and\n99.24% for PM10, the HA filter offers exceptional defense against dangerous airborne particles.\nThese devices, which are biodegradable face masks and cigarette filters, address the environmental\nissues associated with traditional filters' non-biodegradable trash while also lowering exposure to\nair contaminants. This study demonstrates a sustainable strategy for addressing air pollution by\nfusing the excellent filtration capability of HA technology with data-driven insights from SHAP\nanalysis. Significant ecological and health benefits can be obtained by combining predictive\nmodeling with eco-friendly solutions, especially in areas like Nepal where air quality and waste\nmanagement are serious problems. This study shows how machine learning and novel materials\ncan be used to successfully address related environmental and public health issues.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The little part at the end of a cigarette called a filter reduces the amount of dangerous chemicals\nthat might enter the smoker's body and negatively impact their health. In 1931, the premium\ncigarette filter brand Parliament (Benson and Hedges) was introduced to the market (Pauly et al.,\n2009). The actual cigarette was a premium-filtered cigarette. In 1936, Viceroy, the first filtered\ncigarette with a cork tip, was invented (https://tobaccotactics.org). Around 70 mm in length,\ncigarettes were usually unfiltered at the time, and all brands were similar (Kozlowski et al., 2000).\nIn 1953, cellulose acetate fiber-based cork-tipped cigarettes were first made commercially\navailable. In 1940, filters were promoted as a novelty product to attract female smokers (Browne\nCL, 1990). The most effective barrier against cigarette smoke in human health history was the\n\"Micronite Filter,\" developed by Lorillard in 1954 (Borio G, 2009). Again, similar vents were\nadded to filters made in the 1970s, which let air into the mainline smoke (O'Connor et al., 2008).\nThe parameters that were causing the smoke components to undergo retention both with and\nwithout the addition of activated carbon were then identified by Swiss scientists in the 1973s.\nToday, cigarette filters can be seen every day and everywhere (\u201cFacile Synthesis of Porous\nCarbon/Fe3O4 Composites Derived from Waste Cellulose Acetate by One-Step Carbothermal\nMethod as a Recyclable Adsorbent for Dyes,\u201d 2020; Kumar Raja Vanapalli et al., 2023; Parveen\net al., 2024).\nBy the 1980s, almost all cigarettes sold all over the world had filters (93% market share, non-filter\ncigarettes, 7% market share) (Pauly et al., 2009). Also in same year, studies had been conducted\nwhich showed that smokers of low-yield, ventilated-filter (\u2018less-hazardous') cigarettes sometimes\nsuccessfully defeated the purpose of the smoke-dilution holes by occluding the holes (Kozlowski\net al., 1980). In 2003, carbon filters were developed for cigarette to provide potentially less\nexposure to the carcinogens of conventional cigarettes but it failed to get significant customers and\nwas stopped to be used (Laugesen et al., 2006). For making cigarette filters safer, various steps\nhave been put forwarded, anti-toxic flavoring agents can be added to filters like described in\n(Bellamah et al., 2008), studies for determination of components of tobacco used in cigarettes have\nbeen conducted (Leanderson et al., 1997; Qamar and Sultana, 2011; Yang, 1958; Cuzin et al.,\n1965; Shifflett et al., 2017; Mi et al., 2015), and standard filters using compounds like polyphenols\nto remove contaminants (Catel-Ferreira et al., 2015) and new filters are being developed which\ncan be used even in cigarettes and research for improving filtering efficiency by making\nimprovement in ventilation are also being conducted (Kozlowski et al., 2006). Cigarette\ncompounds that are used by enzymes or other elements in the arsenic methylation process.\nFurthermore, cigarettes themselves contain a small quantity of arsenic; after consuming one\ncigarette, 0.25 \u00b5g of arsenic was detected (ATSDR). Because smoking and groundwater\nconsumption of arsenic have a synergistic impact, residents of areas with high concentrations of\narsonic are at risk for major health effects (Watts et al., 2018).\nWith 38% of men and 6% of women consuming other kinds of tobacco and 30% of men and 9%\nof women smoking cigarettes, Nepal has the highest rates of tobacco usage in South Asia (Nepal|\nGlobal Action to End Smoking, 2021). One in Nepal, tobacco use is becoming a bigger problem\nand a public health issue. Major problem with smoking cigarettes is that it can result in\ndevelopment of cancer (AL-Hashimi et al., 2023). It adds to morbidity and mortality and raises the\nrisk of a number of infectious and non-communicable illnesses, including cancer, heart disease,\nchronic respiratory disorders, and tuberculosis. The Nepalese government was working on a ban\non e-cigarettes as of May 2024, which would forbid their manufacture, importation, distribution,\nsale, public use, and promotion. Although heated tobacco products (HTPs) are not prohibited by\nlaw, they are not sold in the nation. Health warnings on devices or e-liquid packaging are not\nnecessary as of 2022. Regulations limiting e-cigarette flavors do not exist.\nFace masks have been life-savior devices in the modern world. Masks may typically shield the\nwearer from breathing in dangerous gasses, tiny particles (like pollens or allergies), and airborne\nmicroorganisms (like germs or viruses) (Pandit et al., 2021). Masks, respirators, face shields, or\ngoggles have shown their ability to protect from respiratory infections (Adib Bin Rashid &\nNazmir-Nur Showva, 2023). The purpose of face masks, such as medical masks and other filtered\nvarieties like N95 and KN95 respirators, is to shield users from germs, viruses, and airborne\nparticles (O'Dowd et al., 2020). While medical masks with higher-grade filters offer more strong\nprotection by filtering tiny particles, medical masks, which are usually composed of many layers\nwith synthetic fiber filters, are crucial for healthcare environments. During and during the COVID-\n19 epidemic, these masks have been essential for safeguarding public health in Nepal, particularly\nin crowded metropolitan areas (Singh et al., 2021). There are several varieties of face masks, each\ndesigned for a certain defensive purpose. Disposable surgical masks composed of layers of\nsynthetic materials, such as polypropylene, are used extensively in healthcare; they shield others\nfrom the wearer's respiratory emissions and block bigger droplets (Shirvanimoghaddam et al.,\n2022). A greater level of filtration is offered by N95 respirators, which are often used in industrial\nand medical environments. They block at least 95% of airborne particles and give better protection\nagainst tiny particles. The general population frequently wears cloth masks, which come in a\nvariety of textiles, for basic protection, particularly in situations when medical-grade masks might\nnot be required (Ju et al., 2021).\nFace masks are an important public health measure in Nepal, providing crucial defense against\nrespiratory diseases and extreme air pollution. Urbanization trends have brought many challenges,\none of the most acute of which is air pollution (Liu et al., 2022). Masks were crucial in stopping\nthe spread of the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic, particularly in crowded cities, protecting\nsusceptible groups including the elderly and people with weakened immune systems\n(Wimalawansa, 2020). In addition to tobacco usage, air pollution from automobiles, building dust,\nand industrial pollutants is a common occurrence in Nepal's cities, including as Kathmandu,\nplacing locals at risk for cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. By blocking hazardous\nparticulate matter, masks\u2014especially those with filters\u2014help lessen the negative health effects of\nextended exposure to pollution (Carlsten et al., 2020). Furthermore, donning a mask has come to\nrepresent civic duty and a dedication to individual and public health. Face masks are now widely\naccessible and reasonably priced, making them an economical way to promote health and\nwellbeing in Nepal.\nIn Nepal and other developing countries, cigarette and mask filters have a big impact on the\nenvironment and public health.\nCigarette filters, made of cellulose acetate, a non-biodegradable substance, are primarily used to\nreduce the amount of nicotine and dangerous tar that is consumed (Everaert et al., 2023). However,\nthey often give smokers the erroneous sense that they are safe, and they do not considerably reduce\nhealth hazards. With 38% of men and 6% of women consuming other kinds of tobacco and 30%\nof men and 9% of women smoking cigarettes, Nepal has the highest rates of tobacco usage in\nSouth Asia. In Nepal, tobacco use is becoming a bigger problem and a public health issue. It adds\nto morbidity and mortality and raises the risk of a number of infectious and non-communicable\nillnesses, including cancer, heart disease, chronic respiratory disorders, and tuberculosis (Using\nBehaviour Change Interventions to Decrease Tobacco Use in Nepal POLICY BRIEF Using\nBehaviour Change Interventions to Decrease Tobacco Use in Nepal, n.d.). Smoking and\ngeographic differences had certain effects on the risk of liver cancer (Li et al., 2024). Obviously,\nmost of the tobacco is used in cheap filters in Nepal which are accused to be less effective against\ncarcinogenic compounds like nitrosamines present in cigarette's smoke.\nAn estimated 5.7 trillion cigarettes were consumed worldwide in 2016, which translates to 1.2\nmillion tons of cigarette butt discarded annually. By 2025, this number is predicted to rise by more\nthan 50% (Akanyeti et al., 2020). Worldwide, cigarette usage is quite high. With no practical\npurpose, used cigarettes are being discarded on the ground or in the trash (Singh et al., 2020).\nSimilarly in case of Nepal due to insufficient waste management systems, discarded cigarette butts\naccumulate in rivers and towns, worsening pollution by releasing dangerous chemicals and\nmicroplastics into the environment (Shah et al., 2023). According to the research by Neupane et\nal. (2019) on locally accessible facemasks in Nepal, Cloth Masks' filtering effectiveness varied\nbetween 63% and 84%. It was discovered that the surgical mask has a 94% filtering efficacy. They\ncame to the conclusion that the main difference in efficiency is the cloth facemask's bigger pore\nsize and any contributing circumstances, such as stretching, drying, and washing. According to the\nstudy by (Tcharkhtchi et al., 2021), the maks described with their comfortness and reusability and\npresented in the Table 1 are the types of masks common in use in different parts of the world along\nwith developing country like Nepal.\nIn a similar vein, mask waste has increased due to the frequent usage of masks, particularly during\nperiods of severe pollution or health emergencies like COVID-19. Economic limitations cause\nmany people in Nepal and comparable places to rely on less expensive, less effective masks, such\nas surgical masks or single-layer fabric, which give poor protection against fine particulate matter\n(PM2.5) and other pollutants, even though masks like N95 offer good filtration. Because single-\nuse masks frequently wind up in landfills or are burned, releasing harmful substances into the\natmosphere, improper disposal of these masks also adds to pollution.\nA multifaceted strategy is needed to address these problems, which includes promoting\nbiodegradable alternatives, improving trash disposal and recycling facilities, and increasing public\nawareness of the environmental effects of cigarette filters and mask debris (Bhattacharjee et al.,\n2022). Encouraging the development of biodegradable cigarette filters through laws might reduce\nenvironmental strain, while providing subsidies for high-quality, reasonably priced masks would\nenhance health results. One of the most prevalent pollutants in the environment is waste cigarette\nfilters (WCF) (Yusuf Wibisono et al., 2024). Nepal and other areas might lower pollution and\nenhance public health in this way, but long-term change requires concerted work at the local and\ngovernmental levels (Acharya, 2024).\nDespite many perceptions that filters are highly defensive against toxic compounds of smoke like\nnitrosamines research has shown that cigarette filters do not offer much health benefit and filtered\ncigarettes are not less harmful than unfiltered cigarettes, whether for smokers or passive smokers\n(https://tobaccotactics.org). Potential solutions have been explored to make toxic compounds that\nemit during filtration to be removed. Thus far, the main approaches have focused on treating filters\ncontaminated with toxicants as described by ISO mainstream smoke that yields of 43 toxicants\nthat were measured from cigarettes containing treated tobaccos; lower yields of tar, nicotine,\ncarbon monoxide (16\u201320%), acrylonitrile, ammonia, aromatic amines, pyridine, quinolene and\nhydrogen cyanide (33\u201351%), tobacco specific nitrosamines (25\u201332%); phenolics (24\u201356%),\nbenzene (16%), toluene (25%) and cadmium (34%) with increased yields of increased yields of\nformaldehyde (49%) and isoprene (17%) (Liu et al., 2011). The research that are conducted using\ncurrently available filters to reduce toxicants have focused on modification of filters for improving\nthe filtering capacity and to recycle the cigarette butts and the chemicals trapped in it during\nfiltration (Torkashvand et al., 2022). Development of safest, most reliable and reusable material\nfor filtering the toxic compounds from smoke generated during combustion remains a challenge.\nThis can decrease the health impacts generated by this large industry producing cigarette that are\nstill ineffective to provide full security to smokers against toxic compounds through filters. Studies\nand reports suggest that polyphenols help to significantly reduces the cytotoxicity, which defines\nprotective role in lung epithelium (Qamar and Sultana, 2011).\nAccording to the study, (Doctype Innovations, 2024) conducted in Nepal, the following are the\nprimary health hazards linked to tobacco use: Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs): A number of\nNCDs are significantly influenced by tobacco smoking, including: Diseases of the Heart (CVDs):\nSmoking raises the risk of stroke and heart disease. Lung diseases include respiratory conditions\nsuch as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Cancer: Smoking is associated with a\nnumber of malignancies, most notably lung cancer and cancers connected to tobacco use.\nMortality: Approximately 27,100 deaths in Nepal are caused by tobacco use annually, making up\n14.9% of all fatalities in the nation. This includes 14.1% of female fatalities and 15.6% of male\ndeaths. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs): Tobacco use contributes to 6% of DALYs for\nall ages and both sexes, indicating a significant burden of disease and disability caused by tobacco-\nrelated health issues. These health risks highlight the urgent need for effective tobacco control\nmeasures in Nepal.\nE-cigarettes had revolutionized the consumption process of cigarette and have been being\nconsumed for about a decade but it has resulted a manifestation period of two or more decades for\nthe generation of numerous smoking related symptoms and health effects (Balfour et al., 2021,\nLucchiari et al., 2020,, Roditis et al., 2015, Bozier et al., 2020, Cohen et al., 2022, Begh and\nAveyyard, 2020). The steps taken to examine the long-term effects of vaping on public health have\nbeen taken too early. Studies have been done through which comparison of the genotoxic and\ncytotoxic capacity of mainstream smoke obtained from non-filter 2R4F, CA-filter 2R4F, and\ncarbon-filter 2R4F cigarettes were determined, using the assays: bacterial mutagenic assay and a\nneutral red cytotoxicity assay (Shin et al., 2009). Epidemiological studies have shown that the log-\nterm consumption of polyphenols offer protective effects against the cancer, cardiovascular\ndiseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and neurogenerative diseases strongly suggest that long-term\nconsumption of diets (fruits, vegetables, tea, and coffee) rich in polyphenols offer protective\neffects against the development of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis, and\nneurodegenerative diseases. (Rudrapal et al., 2022; Castelli et al., 1981; Teo et al., 2006;\nHerxheimer et al., 1967; Talcott et al., 1989; Auerbach et al., 1979; Cryer et al., 1976). The\nobservations in research carried out suggest that inhalation of tobacco containing nicotine reduces\nvascular PGL production causing cardiovascular disease (Nadler et al., 1983).\nNitrosamines as shown in Fig. 1 have been seen to be constituents of food, beverage, air, cigarette\nsmoke, cosmetics and industrial environments and the tobacco specific nitrosamines are also major\ncompounds present in tobacco which are needed to be studied and reviewed well. (IARC 17\n1978; Banbury Report 1982; Magee 1996; Lin 1990; Preussmann and Eisenbrand 1984; Preston-\nMartin and Correa 1989; Tricker 1997; Magee 1989; Tricker et al. 1989; Startin 1996; Loeppky\nand Michejda 1984; Eisenbrand et al. 1996; Scanlan 1999;). Tobacco-specific nitrosamines\n(TSNAs) actually are group of carcinogens which are generated in tobacco smoke. They get\nproduced from nictotine and related alkaloids during the processing of tobacco and tobacco\nproducts. The most common Tobacco specific nitrosamines are: NNN (N'-nitrosonornicotine),\nNNK ((4-methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone), NAB (N'-nitrosoanabasine) and NAT\n(N-nitrosoanatabine) (Hoffman et al., 1982). The research conducted over hamster rats showed\nthat NNN and NNK induced tumors in the upper respiratory tract of the rats and that NNK is the\nmost effective and active carcinogen of TSNA that induce adenoma and adenocarcinoma in the\nhuman lung. Such harmful effects over the consumer's lung can be predicted in human beings too\n(Hoffman et al., 1982; Konstantinou et al.,2018; Pool-Zobel et al, 1992; Levy et al., 2004;\nArredondo et al., 2006; Ashley et al., 2010). Among nicotine-derived carcinogens, the most\nimportant one is nitrosamine is 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3- pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK).\nSecondary reduction of NNK degrades to 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol\n(NNAL) that has an adverse health effect (Matt et al., 2011). So, there is a need of invention to\nreduce such compounds through functionalization of cigarettes (Hoffman et al., 1995).\nsuggesting that there is a need for further focus. The low priority position for risk management\nactions was further supported by the MOE values exceeding 10,000 for acetaldehyde,\npropionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and acetone. On the other hand, based on EC usage, the MOEs\nfor formaldehyde and acrolein were less than 10,000, indicating a greater need for action. It was\nobserved that the MOEs for EC usage were one to two orders of magnitude greater than those\nlinked to smoking exposure for the same toxicants. Moreover, the MOE values obtained from EC\nemissions for the nitrosamines N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and N-nitrosodimethylamine\n(NDMA) exceeded 10,000. Nevertheless, the MOEs for butyraldehyde, acetone, and NNN were\nbased on little information, mostly from non-inhalation or acute exposure investigations. The study\nshowed that the lower emission levels from EC use led to a less hazardous toxicological profile\nwhen compared to traditional cigarette smoking.\nFurthermore, smoking was found to be a significant contributing factor in an in-silico research on\ntransitional cell carcinoma (TCC), the most common kind of bladder cancer (Vitti et al., 2020).\nAccording to experimental findings from the research conducted on rats (Visioli et al., 2000), the\nnegative effects of smoke-induced oxidative stress were lessened when small amounts of\nhydroxytyrosol were given through wastewater from olive mills. Additionally, polyphenols\nderived from olive trees may be used to alter cigarette smoke vapors, lowering nitrosamine levels,\naccording to the research by de Falco et al. (2020). Despite recent increases in awareness of the\npotential environmental harm that cigarettes and their constituents may cause, prior studies on\ntobacco toxicity have mostly concentrated on smoking-related illnesses and how to prevent and\ntreat them in people (such as lung cancer) (Santos-Echeand\u00eda et al., 2021).\nConsumption of e-cigarettes is not a risk-free habit too. In the case study conducted in Kathmandu\nMetropolitan City (KMC) in (Khanal et al., 2023). The lifetime e-cigarette usage rate was 21.2%,\nwhile the current e-cigarette use rate was 5.9%. Having more close friends (AOR = 5.23, CI: 1.26,\n16.39), friends who also used e-cigarettes (AOR = 7.23, CI: 0.93, 22.82), being a man (AOR =\n2.88, CI: 2.15, 10.35), and being older (COR = 5.07, CI: 0.93, 8.19) were important variables\nimpacting current e-cigarette usage. The number of friends who used e-cigarettes (AOR = 5.90,\nCI: 2.15, 10.35), male gender (AOR = 3.53, CI: 2.15, 10.35), age (COR = 4.56, CI: 0.98, 6.24),\nand place of residence (COR: 5.19, CI: 0.83, 8.02) were also associated with lifetime e-cigarette\nusage. Males were much more likely than females to use it (5.4% vs. 0.5%). While 56.5% of\nrespondents acknowledged that e-cigarettes might increase conventional smoking, 34.8% of\nrespondents saw e-cigarettes as a tool to help people quit smoking. Most undergraduate students\n(64.7%) thought e-cigarettes were safer than traditional smokes.0.5%. The study (McNeill et al.,\n2015) successfully demonstrated the important events that connect toxicant exposure to smoking-\nrelated disorders, covering a wide range of chemicals, using the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP)\narchitecture. This paradigm was used in a number of investigations, including chemical analysis,\nin silico modeling, in vitro biological evaluations, and human trials, to compare a closed modular\ne-cigarette (the Vype e-Pen) with traditional cigarettes. The results yielded the most extensive\ndataset for a single e-cigarette product to date. All things considered, our findings support Public\nHealth England's findings, which indicate that modular e-cigarettes, such as the e-Pen, are less\ndangerous than traditional cigarettes.\nParticulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen\ndioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are common airborne\nhazardous substances that can be harmful when inhaled (Sylvester Chibueze Izah et al., 2024).\nRespiratory and cardiovascular issues can result from particulate matter (PM), particularly tiny\nparticles (PM2.5), which can enter the circulation and go deep into the lungs. Reduced oxygen\nsupply to bodily tissues can result from the colorless gas carbon monoxide, which is generated by\nindustrial operations and vehicular emissions (Cope, 2020). Sulfur dioxide, which is mostly\nproduced by burning fossil fuels, can aggravate the respiratory system and exacerbate symptoms\nof asthma. Nitrogen dioxide, which comes from combustion sources as well, can lower immunity\nto infections and cause inflammation in lung tissue (Krismanuel & Hairunisa, 2024). Smog's main\ningredient, ozone, irritates the airways and exacerbates respiratory conditions (Arif & Hassan,\n2023). Last but not least, volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, are emitted from a variety of\nsources, such as paints and gasoline, and can raise the risk of cancer and respiratory problems.\nSuch toxic compounds are blocked by filters used in face maks as shown in Fig. 3."}, {"title": "2.

Some recent progresses and insights on development\nhave been discussed in different subsections."}, {"title": "3.1. Recent development of filters in cigarettes", "content": "The goals of recent advancements in cigarette filters have been to improve user experience,\nsustainability, and filtering efficiency. The utilization of biological materials, sophisticated\nfiltration systems, and creative designs that enhance smoke quality and lower hazardous emissions\nare examples of innovations. These developments are a result of increased knowledge of the\nnegative effects smoking has on one's health and the environment.\nIf biological materials are considered, by using vegetable flour paste to create compartments for\nboth smoke flow and filtration, a novel filter design has the potential to improve the environmental\nimpact of cigarette manufacture (Alessandro, 2021). Advanced Filtration Systems to improve the\ncharacterisation of secondhand smoke, researchers have created a filter-based system that\nsimulates the deposition of respiratory particles in humans. High repeatability and particle-filtering\neffectiveness were displayed by this technology, which is essential for comprehending the health\nhazards linked to smoking (Hao et al., 2022).\nIn order to increase hardness and decrease tar visibility, recent designs use filters with different\nsmoke channel diameters, improving user experience without compromising structural integrity\n(Yu & Kenichi, 2014). Furthermore, a filtering unit enables the dynamic modification of filtering\nmaterials, which may enhance taste and filtration efficiency while in use (Shaoqiang, 2015).\nOn the other hand, even though these developments are meant to lessen health concerns, smoking\nstill has intrinsic risks, and it is still up for discussion whether these filters can actually\nconsiderably reduce harm. Table 5 below presents the literature review on recent progress in\ndevelopment of filters:"}, {"title": "3.2.

Environmental effects of cigarette and masks", "content": "As the filtering membranes in cigarettes and masks are essential to be used, but they can have\nharmful effects on environment which need to be considered before applying them in such devices.\nCigarette and mask filters have a big impact on the environment, especially when it comes to\npublic health and air quality. While mask filters may lose their effectiveness when exposed to\ncigarette smoke, cigarette filters produce harmful substances that add to pollution. This interaction\ncalls into question the effectiveness of preventative measures as well as direct exposure to\ndangerous compounds. The significant pollution from cigarette and mask filters affects aquatic\necosystems and air quality. Cigarette filters, which are mostly made of cellulose acetate, are the\nmost littered item in the world, with an estimated 7 billion thrown away annually (Kadir & Sarani,\n2015). These filters discharge toxic substances into the environment, putting human health and\nmarine life at risk (Nitschke et al., 2023). However, mask filters, particularly those exposed to\ncigarette smoke, show a marked decline in filtration capacity, potentially leading to increased\nexposure to harmful pollutants (Heo et al., 2022). Literature review on pollution caused by face\nmasks and cigarettes are discussed in Table 11.\ncomponent of masks worn in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley, according to research by Kattel et al.\n(2023), is polypropylene microplastic, which may have negative environmental effects.\nFurthermore, contradicting popular belief, 2017 research by John and Ross polled 1,204 cigarette\ndealers in Nepal, gathering 4,307 empty packs and discovering that domestic sales, not illegal\nimports, are the main source of low-quality cigarettes. Cigarettes of poor quality are undoubtedly\nless effective at preventing carcinogenic substances.\nIt became clear that a comprehensive approach was required to address the negative effects that\nsingle-use face masks and cigarette waste were having on the environment and human health. To\nreduce soil and water contamination, stricter laws governing the biodegradability and disposal of\ncigarette filters were required, in addition to public education initiatives encouraging appropriate\ndisposal methods. Furthermore, the creation of eco-friendly filter substitutes may aid in lowering\npollution from dangerous chemicals and polymers. According to studies by Beutel et al. (2021)\nand De-la-Torre et al. (2023), in order to reduce microplastic waste and leachate formation, mask\npollution has to be addressed by developing reusable or single-use masks composed of\nbiodegradable materials. Education and incentives for appropriate mask disposal might\nsignificantly minimize plastic pollution in natural habitats. To address these environmental issues,\ninternational cooperation on rules to efficiently manage waste disposal and encourage sustainable\nmaterial use in product manufacture was crucial.\nMarkosyan et al. (1971) conducted research on the usage of cellulose acetate fibers in cigarette\nfilters and discovered that the weight of the fibers rose with their diameter. According to this study,\nthe sorption of different tobacco smoke components was made possible by hydrogen bond\nformation, which increased the quantity of hydroxyl groups. It did not, however, explain how\nsorption effectiveness was increased for certain harmful chemicals, such 3,4-benzpyrene. The\nresults also demonstrated that the internal fiber surface area increased as the amount of acetate\nsubstituted in the fibers decreased.\nAdditionally, functional nanocoatings modeled after natural polyphenols were studied by Sadabad\net al. (2019). Polyphenol solutions oxidized and polymerized when exposed to UV light, forming\nplant-based polyphenol micropatterns on surfaces. More consistent polyphenolic nanocoatings\nwere made possible by this regulated process, which was supported by antioxidants. The idea of\nsubstrate-independent coating precursors is derived from this technique, which takes use of the\npotent adhesion qualities of mussel foot proteins (MFP) and the capacity of plant phenols to\nconnect with a variety of substrates. But applying these nanocoatings to cigarette filters is a novel\nconcept that needs more investigation to reach its full potential. Even if these coatings have several\nuses, it might be difficult to guarantee compatibility and adherence between layers as well as\nbetween the coating and substrate.\nFurthermore, cutting-edge research on functionalized carbon nanotube-based filters by Yoosefian\n(2018) indicates encouraging potential to lower tobacco-specific nitrosamines in cigarettes.\\"}]}

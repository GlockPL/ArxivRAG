Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of how effectively these hierarchical control mechanisms work. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework based on constraint prioritization to assess how well LLMs enforce instruction hierarchies. Our experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that models struggle with consistent instruction prioritization, even for simple formatting conflicts. We find that the widely-adopted system/user prompt separation fails to establish a reliable instruction hierarchy, and models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraint types regardless of their priority designation.

The instruction-following capabilities have transferred LLMs from general-purpose language models into adaptable tools for specific applications (Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023).\nWith widespread deployment of instruction-following LLMs, their design choices have evolved to reflect real-world usage patterns. A notable development is the emergence of role-based instruction management, exemplified by the system/user separation pattern adopted by major LLM providers, including many open-source LLMs. They often explicitly differentiate between developers and end-users (and tools in agentic systems), where developers regulate the general capabilities of the LLM to better serve a specific end-user population, often through system-level constraints.\nThis deployment pattern reflects an underlying assumption that different instruction sources should have varying levels of authority over model behavior. For instance, OpenAI explicitly states in their 2024 Model Spec that developer (system) messages should take precedence when user and developer instructions. This hierarchy is crucial not only for model safety (Wallace et al., 2024), but also for LLM-based agentic systems serving third-party users (Gravitas, 2023), where developers can employ meta-prompts to configure an LLM as an agent's core component, prompts that should neither be revealed to nor overridden by end-users.\nTo systematically investigate LLMs' handling of instruction hierarchies, we design a controllable framework (Figure 1) for examining the hierarchical authority in LLMs through constraint prioritization. Our initial experiments across six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a concerning observation: even with basic formatting conflicts (such as contradictory length requirements or capitalization rules), models exhibit highly inconsistent behaviors in choosing which instruction to follow.\nMotivated by these preliminary findings, we dive deeper into understanding model behaviors by proposing several specialized metrics that measure conflict awareness, instruction prioritization patterns, and behavioral tendencies. Through extensive experiments using these metrics, we uncover several concerning patterns: models rarely acknowledge the existence of conflicting instructions in their responses, and even when they do recognize conflicts, they frequently fail to maintain proper instruction hierarchies. Moreover, we discover that models exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain types of constraints, regardless of their priority designation.\nGiven these challenges, we explore two possible interventions: prompting-based adjustments and fine-tuning. While both interventions improve prioritization to some extent, neither fully resolves instruction hierarchy enforcement. These findings suggest that robust handling of instruction hierarchies remains a fundamental challenge in current LLM architectures."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Role-based Instruction Management Recent work has highlighted the importance of role-based controls in LLM deployments through system messages. System messages have emerged as a specialized component for developers to configure model behavior, introduced prominently with ChatGPT (Achiam et al., 2023) and adopted by various models including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2024), Claude (Claude, 2023), and Command R. The evolution from early models like Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), which used fixed system messages primarily for consistency, to more sophisticated approaches that enable dynamic behavioral control (Kung and Peng, 2023; Lee et al., 2024), reflects the growing importance of instruction management in LLM systems.\nInstruction Hierarchies and LLM Safety The management of instruction hierarchies has become particularly crucial in the context of LLM safety and security. Research on prompt injection attacks has revealed how end users can potentially bypass developer-intended constraints, leading to important insights about LLM instruction processing and deployment practices (Wu et al., 2024a; Hines et al., 2024; Toyer et al., 2023). Another approach is to treat user inputs as data rather than instructions (Chen et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Zverev et al., 2024) to prevent such bypasses. Wallace et al. (2024) further expanded this understanding by investigating how models prioritize different prompt elements, including system prompts, user messages, and tool outputs. The significance of instruction hierarchy in LLM safety is underscored by Li et al. (2024), who identify it as a core safety aspect of LLMs."}, {"title": "3 Problem Identification", "content": "Despite widespread adoption in deployed LLM systems, system/user prompt separation fails to provide a reliable instruction hierarchy, with models inconsistently getting confused by even simple formatting conflicts. In this section, we demonstrate how instruction hierarchy failures occur through controlled experiments.\nTo evaluate whether system/user prompt separation effectively manages instruction authority in LLMs, we propose constraint prioritization as a probe to reveal how models handle competing directives. This section presents a systematic framework (Figure 1) for investigating how LLMs handle conflicting directives through carefully designed constraint pairs. When presented with two contradictory but individually valid constraints, the model's output reveals which constraint exerts stronger control over the generation process. By varying how these constraints are presented in the model input, we can robustly investigate whether the system/user prompt separation effectively enforces the intended hierarchical control."}, {"title": "3.1 Dataset Construction", "content": "Our dataset construction process follows a hierarchical approach, building from basic tasks to complex prompts with conflicting constraints.\nBase Tasks We curated 100 diverse tasks covering common LLM applications such as writing emails, stories, advertisements, and analytical responses, based on Zhou et al. (2023). Each task is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate various types of output constraints while maintaining its core objective. An example task is Write a blog post about a trip to Japan as in Figure 2, and more examples are provided in Figure 6 in Appendix A.\nOutput Constraints In this study, we focus on explicitly conflicting constraints that are both mutually exclusive and programmatically verifiable. Previously, Zhou et al. (2023) created the IFEval dataset, which systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to follow different types of output constraints. Based on model performance on IFEval, we selected six types of constraints that models can reliably follow when presented individually. See Table 1 for the conflicts (\u201cconflicting constraint pairs\u201d).\nTask-Constraint Combinations We combine each base task with each constraint pair, designating one constraint as primary (i.e., taking priority over the other). We include both possible priority designations, resulting in a total of 100 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 2 = 1,200 unique test data points.\nRich Context Enhancement To enhance the robustness of our findings, we created enriched versions of each prompt with expanded task descriptions and constraints while preserving the core conflicts (via few-shot prompting). An author of the paper verified that the enrichments preserved the original semantics of the tasks while adding realistic complexity to the prompts. An example comparing a base prompt and its enriched version is shown in Figure 2."}, {"title": "3.2 Instruction Priority Mechanism", "content": "Baselines Before examining how models handle instruction conflicts, we establish two baseline conditions to understand their fundamental behavior: (1) Instruction Following Baseline (IF) Tests each model's ability to follow individual constraints in isolation, establishing baseline performance for each constraint type without competing instructions. (2) No Priority Baseline (NP) Places all instructions (base task and both constraints) in the user message without using the hierarchical structure, revealing the model's internal bias on different output constraints (Section 4.4). The baseline is obtained by averaging over both priority designations to isolate the effects of instruction ordering.\nUser/System Separation Configurations We examine multiple configurations of the system/user prompt separation to assess its effectiveness as a priority control mechanism: Pure Separation (Pure) places the primary constraint in the system message as a system-level directive, while keeping the base task and the secondary constraint in the user message. Task Repeated Separation (Task) repeats the task description in both messages while maintaining constraint separation, mirroring common deployment patterns where system messages define general roles that are instantiated by specific user requests. Emphasized Separation (Emph.) enhances the system message with explicit priority declaration (You must always follow this constraint)."}, {"title": "3.3 Evaluation Metrics", "content": "Outcome Categories Given our set of prompts with conflicting constraints and some resolution policy, we programmatically verify constraint satisfaction in the responses to compute:\n\u2022 Primary Obedience Rate (R1): The proportion of responses where only the primary (i.e., prioritized) constraint is satisfied.\n\u2022 Secondary Obedience Rate (R2): The proportion of responses where only the secondary (not prioritized) constraint is satisfied.\n\u2022 Non-Compliance Rate (R3): The proportion of responses where neither constraint is satisfied,\nwhere R1 + R2 + R3 = 1. By design, our constraints are mutually exclusive. For output format constraints (e.g., all uppercase vs. all lowercase, or French vs. English), any partial satisfaction attempt (such as mixing cases or providing translations) contributes to R3, as it fails to fully satisfy either requirement. These rates are calculated from experimental observations across all conflict types. Importantly, the constraint satisfaction is determined on the task-relevant output after removing the explicit conflict acknowledgement from the responses (e.g., I notice contradictory instructions asking for...) through few-shot prompting. The analysis of the these acknowledgement behaviors will be presented in Section 4.2."}, {"title": "3.4 The Failure of Instruction Hierarchies", "content": "We evaluated six state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open and closed-source models across different scales. For observation robustness, our evaluation covers both simple and rich instruction settings, with three different system/user prompt separation configurations: Pure separation (Pure), Task Repeated separation (Task), and Emphasized Separation (Emph.).\nInstruction Following Baseline First, we observe that all models demonstrate strong performance (ranging from 74.8\u201390.8%) when following individual constraints without conflicts. This confirms that these models are capable of understanding and executing our selected constraints when presented in isolation.\nPriority Adherence Performance However, the Primary Obedience Rate (R1) - the percentage of responses that follow the primary constraint reveals concerning results about the effectiveness of system/user prompt separation as a priority mechanism. We observe the following: (1) Most models show dramatically lower performance (9.6\u201345.8% average R1) when handling conflicting constraints, compared to their baseline instruction-following capabilities. (2) Different separation configurations (Pure, Task, Emph.) show varying effectiveness, but none consistently maintains the intended hierarchy. Even for the emphasized separation configuration, where priority is explicitly stated, the obedience rate remains far from reliable priority control (GPT40 with 63.8% average R1 performs the best on simple instructions and Claude with 47.5% performs the best on rich-context instructions). (3) Larger models don't necessarily perform better for example, Llama-70B (average 16.4%) shows only modest improvements over its 8B counterpart (average 10.1%), and GPT40 (average 40.8%) is even worse than GPT4o-mini (average 45.8%), despite their better instruction following performance. (4) Performance patterns remain similar between simple and rich instructions, suggesting that the failure of the user/system prompt separation priority mechanism is a robust observation rather than context-dependent.\nOur analysis suggests that the widely-adopted system/user separation fails to reliably enforce instruction hierarchies in LLMs."}, {"title": "4 Model Behavior Analysis", "content": "While the obedience rates establish the failure of system/user separation as a control mechanism, a more detailed characterization of this failure is needed. Non-compliance (R3) can stem from various reasons \u2014 from imperfect instruction following to various forms of conflict recognition. To better characterize model behaviors, we introduce three specialized metrics (detailed in Section 4.1) that focus on clear response patterns: Explicit Conflict Acknowledgement Rate (ECAR) captures when models recognize conflicts, while Priority Adherence Ratio (PAR) and Constraint Bias (CB) measure model behaviors when instructions are successfully followed, isolating these patterns from the noisy non-compliance cases.\nIn this section, through these metrics, we reveal that models rarely acknowledge conflicts explicitly, fail to maintain hierarchies even when they do, and exhibit strong inherent biases toward certain constraints regardless of priority designation."}, {"title": "4.1 Advanced Metrics for Behavior Analysis", "content": "Explicit Conflict Acknowledgement Models occasionally acknowledge conflicting constraints without prompting. Through few-shot prompting, we identify these explicit acknowledgments (e.g., I notice contradictory instructions...) and separate them from responses for two purposes: to ensure constraint evaluation focuses on task-relevant output, and to compute the Explicit Conflict Acknowledgement Rate (ECAR). ECAR measures how often models explicitly recognize conflicts through statements about contradictions, requests for clarification, or explanations of constraint-selection decisions.\nPriority Adherence Ratio (PAR) Priority Adherence Ratio (PAR) measures how well models respect priority designation when they successfully follow a constraint. By focusing only on cases where exactly one constraint is satisfied (excluding non-compliance cases), PAR isolates clear prioritization behavior from noisy failure modes:\n$$PAR = \\frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}$$\nConstraint Bias (CB) Constraint Bias (CB) captures models' inherent preferences between conflicting constraints, independent of priority designation. By measuring constraint following patterns when no priority mechanism is specified (the NP. Baseline from Section 3.2) and averaging across both possible constraint orderings, CB reveals default behavioral tendencies. For example, a model might have an inherent tendency to output English regardless of which language is designated as primary.\n$$CB = \\frac{R_{c1} - R_{c2}}{R_{c1} + R_{c2}}$$\nwhere Rc1 (Rc2) is the obedience rate of constraint c1 (c2) regardless of priority designation. CB ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 indicates no bias and a score closer to 1 (-1) indicates increasing bias towards c1 (c2). Like PAR, this metric isolates clear behavioral patterns by excluding non-compliance cases."}, {"title": "4.2 Ineffective Conflict Acknowledgment", "content": "Our analysis of ECAR in Table 3 shows that models rarely acknowledge instruction conflicts, with ECAR ranging from 0% (Qwen) to 20.3% (Llama-70B). Meanwhile, acknowledgment does not guarantee correct prioritization and there's a clear architectural influence: while Llama models frequently acknowledge conflicts but show mixed constraint following patterns, GPT4o variants and Claude maintain more consistent primary constraint adherence when they do acknowledge conflicts. Notably, when GPT40 models explicitly acknowledge conflicts, they almost never choose to follow the lower-priority constraint. This unique characteristic likely stems from their instruction hierarchy training, as reported in Wallace et al. (2024), suggesting that instruction hierarchy training does lead to more systematic handling of prioritization."}, {"title": "4.3 Failure Modes in Priority Enforcement", "content": "We use polar plots (Figure 3) to analyze how well models enforce instruction priorities while avoiding biases. The radial length (PAR) represents priority adherence, while the angular width (1 \u2013 |CB|) indicates bias resistance. Larger sectors indicate better priority control with minimal bias.\nMost models fail to enforce instruction hierarchies consistently, as reflected in their small total areas. GPT-40 and GPT-40-mini perform best, particularly in binary constraints (language, case), likely due to their explicit instruction hierarchy training. However, even these models show significant variation across constraints, suggesting that their prioritization ability remains inconsistent.\nDistinct failure patterns emerge. Bias-dominated failures (thin spokes) occur when models favor one constraint regardless of priority, as seen in Qwen's language conflict, where it always follows the user constraint. Indecisive failures (short, wide sectors) arise when models fail to enforce priority even when unbiased (e.g., Claude Word Length).\nIn general, models follow categorical constraints (e.g., case, language) more reliably than constraints requiring reasoning along a continuous scale (e.g., keeping counts during generation). This suggests that current instruction-following approaches are better at simple pattern recognition but fail to generalize to more complex constraints.\nThese findings reinforce that LLMs lack a robust mechanism for enforcing instruction priorities across diverse constraints, and also highlights a fundamental limitation in current instruction tuning paradigms."}, {"title": "4.4 Model-specific Constraint Biases", "content": "Our analysis of Constraint Bias (CB) scores reveals that models exhibit strong inherent preferences when resolving conflicting instructions, often overriding designated priority structures. Figure 4 visualizes these biases, where each subplot represents a constraint pair, and bars indicate model-specific tendencies.\nMost models display strong but inconsistent biases across constraint types. Bias magnitudes often exceed 0.5, indicating a clear default tendency toward certain constraints even when models are explicitly instructed otherwise.\nNotably, some biases are widely shared across models. All models favor lowercase over uppercase text, prefer generating texts with more than 10 sentences, and tend toward avoiding keywords. This consistency across different model architectures suggests these biases might stem from common patterns in pre-training data or fundamental architectural designs in current models. For instance, the preference for lowercase likely reflects the pre-dominance of lowercase text in training corpora.\nDespite these shared biases, other preferences vary sharply across models. Word length preferences are particularly diverse: Qwen strongly favors shorter texts (<50 words), while Llama-8B heavily prefers longer texts (>300 words). Language choice and keyword usage frequency similarly show model-specific variations, suggesting these aspects are likely more influenced by individual architectural choices and training approaches than by natural patterns in the data."}, {"title": "5 Empirical Interventions", "content": "Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to enforce instruction hierarchies, often defaulting to inherent biases instead of following system-user directives. We experiment with two potential interventions, prompt-based adjustments and fine-tuning, to determine their effectiveness to mitigate the issue. While both interventions improve prioritization to some extent, neither fully resolves instruction hierarchy enforcement, as models continue to exhibit biases and inconsistent constraint adherence (Figure 5)."}, {"title": "5.1 Prompting-based Adjustments", "content": "We first examine whether models can be steered through explicit priority instructions and constraint marking. Simple priority guidance (e.g., Follow Constraint 1 over Constraint 2 when they conflict) improves adherence but remains inconsistent. In contrast, constraint marking, where constraints are explicitly labeled in the prompt (e.g., Constraint 1: write in English), leads to a clearer prioritization structure across models. However, even with strong directives, models frequently revert to inherent biases, ignoring priority designations (Figure 5 Left). This suggests that while prompting can shift model behavior, it does not establish a stable, generalizable instruction hierarchy. Moreover, explicit constraint marking is often impractical in real-world applications."}, {"title": "5.2 Fine-tuning Approach", "content": "To test whether hierarchical control can be reinforced at the model level, we fine-tune a LoRA-adapted (Hu et al., 2021) Llama-8B on constraint prioritization tasks. Using three-fold cross validation, we train on four conflict types while testing on the remaining two, maintaining the same base tasks across training and test sets. While fine-tuning yields improvements in handling certain constraint types (Figure 5 Right), the gains are inconsistent even in this highly controlled setting with simple, well-defined constraints and shared base tasks. These results suggest that robust hierarchy enforcement may not emerge naturally through conventional fine-tuning approaches alone (at least not this naive setting), and broader questions about maintaining general instruction-following capabilities remain open."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "Our comprehensive investigation into instruction prioritization in LLMs has revealed critical limitations in current models' ability to consistently manage conflicting directives. Despite the widespread adoption of role-based instruction configurations in deployed LLM systems, our findings demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models lack robust mechanisms for maintaining proper instruction priorities, and often fail to acknowledge or resolve conflicts between system and user-level directives. While our attempts to address these issues through prompt engineering and fine-tuning showed modest improvements, they ultimately underscore the need for more fundamental advances in LLM architectures and training regimens to support reliable instruction priority management. These insights not only highlight an important gap in current LLM capabilities, but also provide concrete directions for future research in developing models with more sophisticated instruction-handling capabilities."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "While our study provides a systematic evaluation of instruction hierarchy enforcement in LLMs, several opportunities for expansion remain.\nFirst, our analysis focuses on single-turn interactions with specific constraint phrasings. Real-world applications often involve multi-turn conversations with varied linguistic expressions of the same constraints, where instruction prioritization can evolve dynamically. Understanding how models handle such variations and extended interactions presents an exciting direction for practical applications.\nSecond, our evaluation is constrained to explicitly defined, programmatically verifiable constraints (e.g., formatting rules, keyword inclusion). More complex constraints\u2014such as tone, reasoning depth, safety guidelines, role-playing character settings, or agentic system rules-require either extensive human annotation or evaluation by other LLMs, introducing additional methodological challenges. These qualitatively different constraints might exhibit distinct patterns of hierarchy enforcement, presenting an important direction for future investigation that could reveal new insights about how models handle different types of directives.\nThird, our prompting and fine-tuning experiments use minimal settings. More extensive prompting, pretraining, or reinforcement learning approaches could yield different results. For example, the effectiveness of explicit constraint marking suggests a promising avenue for practical applications. If explicitly marking constraints in the user message improves prioritization, exploring explicit token-level priority encoding\u2014where system and user instructions are assigned semantic priority markers-may offer a more robust solution for instruction hierarchy enforcement.\nLast but not least, while our study reveals clear patterns in how models handle instruction hierarchies, the underlying mechanisms remain to be understood. Why do models show more consistent behavior with certain constraints than others? Is this related to the fundamental nature of next-token prediction, the way constraints influence token-level dependencies, or other architectural factors? Understanding these mechanisms could provide crucial insights for designing more robust instruction-following systems, and even for understanding how LLMs fundamentally process information."}, {"title": "A Base Tasks", "content": "Base Task Examples\n1.

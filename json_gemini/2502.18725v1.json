To address this, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs) as proxies to extract rich semantic information from naturalistic images through a Visual Question Answering (VQA) strategy for analyzing human visual semantic representation. LLM-derived representations successfully predict established neural activity patterns measured by fMRI (e.g., faces, buildings), validating its feasibility and revealing hierarchical semantic organization across cortical regions. A brain semantic network constructed from LLM-derived representations identifies meaningful clusters reflecting functional and contextual associations. This innovative methodology offers a powerful solution for investigating brain semantic organization with naturalistic stimuli, overcoming limitations of traditional annotation methods and paving the way for more ecologically valid explorations of human cognition.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Psychological experimental paradigms-standardized methods designed to investigate mental processes-rely extensively on carefully crafted procedures and stimuli to test specific hypotheses. First, replicability is often an issue. The dependence on specific stimuli can limit the generalizability of findings, and even minor variations in stimuli may yield different results, casting doubt on the reliability of research outcomes (1-3). Second, the experimenter effect (also known as the Rosenthal effect) poses a substantial challenge; Unconscious bias can unintentionally influence participant behavior, twisting results (4). Finally, achieving ecological validity-the degree to which findings generalize to real-world settings-is inherently difficult. Laboratory environments often differ markedly from everyday contexts, limiting the applicability of research conclusions (5). These limitations highlight the pressing need for innovative approaches in psychological research."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "The Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) uses stimuli from the Microsoft COCO dataset, which includes\n80 easily recognizable object categories (30). To extract semantic features from these images, we\nemployed the pre-trained multimodal large language model Blip (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-\ntraining) (31). Its pre-training incorporates graph-text contrastive loss, graph-text matching loss, and\nlanguage modeling loss, which together enhance its semantic comprehension capabilities, enabling\nstrong performance in image-text retrieval and captioning tasks.\nWe employed a regression analysis to assess how well the extracted semantic representation could\nexplain participants' brain activity during visual stimulation. For each participant, the semantic\nrepresentation generated by the large language model (based on image stimuli and corresponding\nprompts) served as predictors in the regression analyses."}, {"title": "2.4 Semantic Hierarchy", "content": "To construct a semantic hierarchy that reflects human conceptual organization, we used WordNet\n(36), a comprehensive lexical database of English. WordNet organizes words through semantic\nrelationships such as synonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy. We established a category hierarchy based\non the hierarchical structure from WordNet. For instance, starting with \"human\", we extracted its\nsuperordinate term \"mammal\" and subordinate terms \"man\". Following this approach, we selected a\nseries of hierarchically related labels, resulting in the specific semantic hierarchy: \u201canimal\u201d \u2192 \u201cmammal\"\n\u2192 \"human\" \u2192 \"man\"."}, {"title": "2.5 Semantic Network Construction", "content": "The activation patterns for individual label were projected onto the cerebral cortex to represent a\nunified spatial semantic network. We then generated a semantic similarity matrix by computing the\nPearson correlation between pairwise cortical activations for each label. This similarity matrix, which\nreflects semantic relationship, was transformed into a distance matrix:\n\n distance = 1 \u2013 similarity.   (1)\n\nThis conversion shifted the correlation matrix range from [-1,1] into a distance matrix range of [0,2].\nAgglomerative hierarchical clustering (37) was applied to the activation results of the 80 semantic labels\nto explore representational distinctions. This clustering method iteratively merged the most similar\nclusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance. Finally, we constructed a semantic connectivity network.\nIn this network, nodes represented individual semantic labels, with attributes for name and cluster"}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "To validate our approach of using LLMs to model brain semantic representation, we first validated\nwhether our method could replicate well-established findings on brain activation patterns for specific\nsemantic categories. We focused on two prominent categories: faces and buildings, which are known to\nelicit distinct responses in specific brain regions. Using semantic representations derived from the LLM\nresponses to image stimuli, we predicted brain activation patterns associated with these categories. As\nshown in Figure 1, images containing faces triggered significant activation in the fusiform face area\n(FFA), a region consistently involved in face processing (25). This result confirms that our model\naccurately captures the established link between face perception and FFA activation. Similarly, images\nof buildings caused significant activation in the parahippocampal area (PPA), a region involved in\nprocessing environmental scenes and buildings (27). This finding further supports our model's ability to\npredict established semantic activations in the brain. Moreover, direct comparison of the activation\npatterns for \"face\" and \"building\" revealed distinct and largely opposing trends. This differentiation\ndemonstrates clear separation between these two semantic categories at the neural level, aligning with\nprevious researches. Our results strongly support the effectiveness of using LLMs as proxies in\npsychological experiments to model brain semantic processing."}, {"title": "3.2 Brain activation patterns of different Semantic labels", "content": "Having validated our method's ability to reproduce established semantic activations for faces and\nbuildings, we next explored brain activation patterns across a broader range of semantic categories. We\nextended our analysis to 80 semantic labels, generating corresponding brain activation profiles\n(Supplementary Figure S1). This expanded analysis revealed distinct activation patterns across various\nbrain regions.\nConsistent with the known role of the ventral visual stream in object recognition, we observed\nwidespread activation across most semantic labels within the lateral occipito-temporal cortex. This\nincluded the superior temporal sulcus (STS), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), superior temporal gyrus\n(STG), superior and transverse occipital sulci, anterior occipital sulcus, supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and\nthe intraparietal sulcus (IPS). However, more specific patterns emerged when examining specific\nsemantic categories. For instance, food-related labels (e.g., banana, broccoli) and some tool-related labels\n(e.g., knife, fork) showed significant activation in frontal regions, specifically the middle frontal gyrus,\nmiddle frontal sulcus, and the superior frontal sulcus (SFS). Conversely, sport-related labels (e.g.,\nbaseball glove, sports ball) exhibited opposing activation trends in these same frontal regions."}, {"title": "3.3 Semantic hierarchical brain activation patterns", "content": "Building upon the analysis of individual semantic labels, we investigated how the brain processes\nhierarchically organized semantic information. We examined the cortical mapping of a four-tiered\nsemantic hierarchy: \"animal\" \u2192 \u201cmammal\u201d \u2192 \u201chuman\u201d \u2192 \"man\". As shown in Figure 3, the activation\npatterns revealed a clear hierarchical structure: as semantic specificity increased (moving down the\nhierarchy), additional brain regions with distinct functions were progressively recruited (orange and light\nblue regions in Figure 3c). Each semantic level exhibited unique activation patterns, but significant\noverlap between levels indicated shared semantic features. Notably, regions such as the TPOJ and the\nMST were consistently activated across all levels of the hierarchy. This aligns with the whole-brain\nactivation patterns observed in Figure 2a, suggesting a general role in semantic processing, regardless\nof specificity."}, {"title": "3.4 Brain semantic network", "content": "To understand how semantic representations are organized within the brain's semantic network, we\nanalyzed the activation profiles of 80 semantic labels across the cerebral cortex. First, we calculated a\nsemantic correlation matrix by computing the Pearson cosine similarity between pairwise cortical\nactivations for each label. Then we applied agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group these labels\nbased on their neural profiles (Figure 4a). This analysis identifies five main clusters that reflects distinct\nfunctional and contextual associations: (1) Dining table (e.g., cup, banana, pizza), (2) Transportation (e.g.,\nbicycle, bus, traffic light), (3) Indoor scene (e.g., chair, bed, refrigerator), (4) Sports (e.g., frisbee, skis,\nsnowboard), and (5) Others (e.g., backpack, tie, kite). The optimal number of clusters was determined\nby maximizing the silhouette coefficient."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "This study introduces a transformative paradigm, \"talking to the brain\", which effectively bridges\nthe gap between complex real-world stimuli and neural semantic processing. By using the rich knowledge\nof large language models (LLMs), this novel approach provides a powerful \"language\" for decoding and\nmodeling the brain's intricate semantic representation. LLMs serve as an advanced intermediary, offering\nsignificant advantages compared to traditional methods. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis approach in capturing neural mechanisms associated with specific semantics. The consistency of\nlocalized cortical activation patterns with previous research validates the use of LLMs as reliable proxies\nfor modeling neural representations of semantic activation in the brain.\nA vital advantage of our LLM-mediated approach is its ability to overcome the inherent limitations\nof traditional event-related fMRI designs. Unlike traditional methods, which isolate specific stimulus\ntypes (40), our paradigm is not constrained by pre-defined semantic categories during data acquisition.\nThis flexibility allows us to explore the brain's response to a far broader and more ecologically valid\nspectrum of concepts, including those not explicitly presented in the experiment. The generalized\nknowledge of LLMs (14,15,41-43) enables investigation about how the brain organizes concepts\nhierarchically. Our findings suggest that semantic hierarchies those constructed in WordNet, are reflected\nin the hierarchical organization of the cortex. Importantly, our findings highlight that activation patterns\nat different hierarchical levels are not always uniform, reflecting the complexity of extensional semantics\nwhere higher-level categories don't fully capture lower-level features (44,45). For example, activation of\n\"mammal\" does not entirely overlay with \u201chuman\". This may be due to the associations between \"human\"\nand other specific object semantics, such as \u201ctools\" (46).\nThe hierarchical clustering of the semantic network, derived from our methodology, further\ndemonstrates its capacity to reflect the brain's semantic organization. The resulting clusters not only\nreflect intuitive groupings of categories (like food and transportation), but also capture more complex,\ncontext-dependent associations related to real-world scenarios and activities. The co-clustering of objects\nfrom different categories highlights how the brain integrates object functionality with scene recognition,\nreflecting practical applications of semantic processing. Similarly, the clustering of movement-related\nterms and animal labels suggests the engagement of motor planning and interaction areas during their\nprocessing. This demonstrates the paradigm's ability to simulate brain activity in dynamic contexts. Even\nseemingly unrelated pairings within clusters suggest the model's sensitivity to delicate, cross-contextual\nsemantic relationships. This associations may arise from shared visual features or life scenarios, further\nemphasizing the richness of semantic connections captured by our approach.\nThis innovative approach holds significant promise for advancing neuroscience research. Firstly, it\nfacilitates a more comprehensive and ecologically valid mapping of the brain's semantic space, moving\nbeyond the limitations of artificial stimulus constraints. Secondly, it provides a powerful framework for\nintegrating and analyzing data from diverse neuroimaging experiments that use rich, naturalistic stimuli.\nBy using LLMs to extract consistent semantic representation (47), data from multiple studies can be\ncombined, overcoming challenges such as small sample sizes and study-specific designs (48), thereby\nenhancing statistical power and supporting more generalizable conclusions about semantic processing in\nthe brain. This capacity for data integration, based on semantic content rather than low-level stimulus\nfeatures, represents a significant leap forward in neuroimaging analysis and offers a pathway to more\nrobust and reproducible findings. Moreover, the consistency of our results across different LLM\narchitectures (BLIP and CLIP using VQA and feature similarity method, as demonstrated in Table S1)\nreveals the robustness and generalizability of our method. While we primarily used the VQA approach,\nthe comparable performance with other models shows the potential of various LLM-based\nimplementations for this \u201ctalking to the brain\u201d paradigm. The capabilities of advanced LLMs like GPT4\n(14) and Gemini (15) further suggest even greater potential for this methodological direction.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current study, including the relatively\nsmall sample size and potential bias in data processing. The use of naturalistic stimuli, while beneficial\nfor ecological validity, also introduces complexity. Furthermore, the simple recognition task used during\nfMRI data collection may not have fully captured the depth of semantic processing. Future research\nshould focus on larger sample sizes and explore more complex task designs to strengthen the robustness\nand generalizability of these findings."}]}

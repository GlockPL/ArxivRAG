INTRODUCTION", "content": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), comprising numerous metamaterials with dynamically tunable electromagnetic responses [1], constitute ultra-lightweight planar structures that can be used to coat building facades, room walls, or vehicles, and are recently considered as one of the candidate technologies for the next generation of wireless networks [2]. They can enable over-the-air signal propagation programmability in an energy-efficient manner, thus, transforming wireless channels to software-defined entities [3] that can be optimized for various objectives, e.g., enhanced multi-user connectivity [4], localization [5], and integrated sensing and communications [6].\nThe core features of RISs, with more pronounced their low hardware footprint recently including even almost transparent designs, have been also lately leveraged for eavesdropping and jamming [7]\u2013[12]. RIS-enabled threat models and proactive countermeasure designs of active and reflective beamforming as well as artificial noise were presented in [7] and [8] for different knowledge levels of the eavesdropper\u2019s channel and unawareness of the presence of a malicious RIS. Jamming attacks based on RISs that are difficult to detect were presented in [11]. Scenarios where the adversary takes control of a legitimate RIS were discussed in [10], while [9] studied the case where an adversary places an RIS in the vicinity of a communication pair for information leakage [9]. The potential of RISs to decrease the received signal strength in a legitimate link, while enhancing it towards an eavesdropper, was analyzed in [12]. However, none of the latter works focused on detecting the presence of malicious RISs in environments where legitimate communications take place, which could then trigger efficient reactive legitimate physical-layer designs.\nOn the other hand, as described in one of the RIS deployment use cases presented in [13], metasurfaces can be deployed from a single cellular operator in an area of intended coverage, where one or many other operators are also active. Those RISs should have a carefully designed bandwidth of influence to provide reconfigurable reflections to the owner operator, while leaving unaltered the signals spanning the bandwidth allocated to the other operator(s). The latter implies that those RISs should react similar to the surface material that hosts them, upon impinging signals from any of the unintended operators. However, such an RIS design for very closely allocated frequency bands is hard to achieve with up-to-date hardware technologies [14]. To this end, an approach that detects third-party non-cooperating RISs would help operators to sense relevant unwanted activity provoking countermeasure designs.\nMotivated by the latter two applications of unwanted RIS operations, we focus, in this paper, on the problem of detecting the operation of one or more non-cooperative RISs in the vicinity of point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. Capitalizing on the discrete-time multipath channel model of [15] and the coupled-dipole formalism of RIS-parametrized channels of [16], we first introduce a wideband channel model incorporating RISs as well as non-reconfigurable stationary surfaces. Then, we present a novel formulation of the RIS activity detection problem as an online sequential change point detection problem [17].

CHANNEL MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "We consider a mobile User Equipment (UE) possessing an $N_{ue}$-element Uniform Linear Array (ULA) that wishes to communicate in the uplink direction with a Base Station (BS), which is equipped with a Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) comprising $N_{bs}$ antenna elements. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission is adopted with $K$ subcarriers and a cyclic prefix of length $D$ per OFDM symbol. In the wireless propagation environment of interest, there might exist RISs that have not been deployed by the targeted uplink communication system, whose presence the BS intends to efficiently detect, e.g., for security purposes [7]-[12].\n       A. Channel Model\n       A convenient wideband channel model for millimeter wave, and beyond, wireless communications is the delay-d one presented in [15], according to which, the $N_{bs} \\times N_{ue}$ MIMO channel between the BS and UE at each d-th sampling point, with $d = 0, 1, ..., D \u2013 1$, consists of $L_{bs,ue}$ propagation paths and is mathematically represented as follows:\n\n$ \\mathbf{H}[d] =  \\sum_{l=1}^{L_{bs,ue}} \\sqrt{P_{L_{bs,ue}}} \\beta_l \\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs}}(\\theta^{AoA}_{l}, \\phi^{AoA}_{l})  \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}^H(\\theta^{AoD}_{l}, \\phi^{AoD}_{l}) p(dT_s - \\tau_l), $\n\nwhere $\\theta_l^{AoA},\\phi_l^{AoA}$ and $\\theta_l^{AoD},\\phi_l^{AoD}$ denote the elevation and azimuth angles with respect to each l-th channel path (l = 1,2,..., $L_{bs,ue}$), respectively, with the superscript $AoA$ taking the letter \u201cA\u201d for the case of angle of arrival and \u201cD\u201d for angle of departure. Superscript $\\phi$ takes the string \u201cbs\u201d when implying the BS and the string \u201cue\u201d for the UE case. We assume that all involved angles are uniformly distributed in [0,2\u03c0]. In addition, $\\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs}}(\u00b7)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}(\u00b7)$ denote the $N_{bs}$-element BS and $N_{ue}$-element UE steering vectors, respectively, whereas $\\beta_l \u223c CN(0, 1)$ is the complex gain of each l-th channel path, and $P_{L_{bs,ue}}$ is the path loss. Finally, p(\u00b7) is a pulse-shaping function for $T$-spaced signaling [15, eq. (3)], and $\\tau_l$ represents\nthe propagation delay for each l-th channel path, which is assumed to take values in the interval [0, $DT_s$] [15].\nTo account for the impact of RISs in the wireless propagation environment, the linear cascaded channel model was first presented in [21], which has been shown via a first-principles coupled-dipole formalism [16] to reasonably approximate signal propagation in MIMO systems, especially with extensive number of antennas operating at high frequencies [22]. To this end, considering R planar reflectors that are either fully or partially covered by RISs in the wireless environment, the end-to-end (e2e) MIMO channel between the BS and UE can be expressed as the superposition of the direct channel $\\mathbf{H}[d]$ and the $N_{bs} \\times N_{ue}$ cascaded channel $\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d]$. The latter models propagation from the UE towards the BS via the R planar reflectors, and can be expressed as follows:\n\n$ \\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d] =  \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs}}(\\theta^{AoA,bs}_{r}, \\phi^{AoA,bs}_{r})^H  \\Bigg[\\sum_{q=1}^{L_{bs,r}} \\sqrt{P_{L_{bs,r}}} \\beta^{bs}_{r,q} \\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs,r}}(\\theta^{bs}_{r,q}, \\phi^{bs}_{r,q})   \\mathbf{S}_r[dT_s]   \\Bigg[\\sum_{n=1}^{L_{r,ue}} \\sqrt{P_{L_{r,ue}}} \\beta^{ue}_{r,n} \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}(\\theta^{AoD,ue}_{r,n}, \\phi^{AoD,ue}_{r,n})\\Bigg]^H   \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}(\\theta^{AoD}_{r}, \\phi^{AoD}_{r}) p (dT_s -  \\tau^{bs}_{r,q} +  \\tau^{ue}_{r,n} ), $\n\nyielding the following expression for the e2e MIMO channel:\n\n$ \\mathbf{H}_{e2e}[d] =  \\mathbf{H}[d] + \\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d]. $\n\nIn (2), $L_{bs,r}$ and $L_{r,ue}$ denote respectively the number of channel paths between each r-th planar reflector (r = 1, 2, ..., R) and the BS and between the UE and this reflector, whereas $P_{L_{bs,r}}$ and $P_{L_{r,ue}}$ represent the respective channel path losses with the product $P_{L_{bs,r}}P_{L_{r,ue}}$ implying the multiplicative path loss contributed in the signal propagation through each r-th reflector. Similar to the angles\u2019 definition in (1), $\\theta^{bs},\\phi^{bs}$ and $\\theta^{ue},\\phi^{ue}$ denote respectively the elevation and azimuth angles with respect to each r-th surface reflector and each x-th channel path, where subscript x takes the values q = 1,2,..., $L_{bs,r}$ for the channel between each r-th reflector and the BS, and the values n = 1,2,... $L_{r,ue}$ for the channel between the UE and each r-th reflector, while superscripts $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ take the same values as in (1) with the only difference being that string $\\phi$ is empty when referring to any of the reflectors. Furthermore, $\\beta \u223c CN(0,1)$ and \u03c4 represent the complex path gain and the propagation delay from each x-th channel path passing through each r-th reflector, whereas $\\phi$ takes the values \u201cbs\u201d and \u201cue\u201d when referring to the channel from the reflector to the BS or the UE to the reflector. Finally, similar to $\\tau_l$ in (1), the values $\\tau^{bs}_{r,q} + \\tau^{ue}_{r,n}$ are assumed to lie in [0, $DT_s$].\nRemark 1. By assuming that: 1) the cascaded channel for each r-th reflector consists of a single path, i.e., $L_{bs,r} = L_{r,ue} = 1 \\forall r$; and 2) the surfaces are time invariant, i.e., $\\mathbf{S}_r[dT_s] = \\mathbf{S}_r[0] \\forall d$, the expression for $\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d]$ given in (2) can be incorporated into that for $\\mathbf{H}[d]$ in (1) by adding R more paths in the latter\u2019s summation."}, {"title": "Proof. Starting from (2) yields:", "content": "\n$\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d] =  \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\sqrt{P_{L_{bs,r}}P_{L_{r,ue}}}  \\beta^{bs}_{r,1} \\beta^{ue}_{r,1}  \\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs}}(\\theta^{AoA,bs}_{r}, \\phi^{AoA,bs}_{r})^H \\mathbf{S}_r[dT_s]  \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}(\\theta^{AoD,ue}_{r,1}, \\phi^{AoD,ue}_{r,1}) \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}^H(\\theta^{AoD}_{r}, \\phi^{AoD}_{r}) p(dT_s -  \\tau^{bs}_{r,1} +  \\tau^{ue}_{r,1} )$\n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d] =  \\sum_{r=1}^{R} \\sqrt{P_{L_{bs,r}}P_{L_{r,ue}}}  \\beta_{r} \\mathbf{a}_{N_{bs}}(\\theta^{AoA,bs}_{r}, \\phi^{AoA,bs}_{r})^H \\mathbf{S}_r[0]  \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}(\\theta^{AoD,ue}_{r,1}, \\phi^{AoD,ue}_{r,1}) \\mathbf{a}_{N_{ue}}^H(\\theta^{AoD}_{r}, \\phi^{AoD}_{r}) p(dT_s -  \\tau^{bs,ue}_{r,1} ).$\n\nIt can be seen that $\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d]$ in (4) has the same form with $\\mathbf{H}[d]$ in (1), with the only difference being some scalar multiplications. This difference can be eliminated by adding R more paths resulting from $\\mathbf{H}_{ref}[d]$ in (4) into the summation for $\\mathbf{H}[d]$ appearing in (1).\nBy modeling each r-th reflector as a surface with $N_{s,r}$ uniformly placed elements similar to a URA (and similar to the coupled-dipole formalism [16], [22]), with $\\mathbf{a}_{N_{s,r}}(\u00b7)$ denoting its steering vector, each matrix $\\mathbf{S}_r[dT_s] \u2208 CN_{s,r}\u00d7N_{s,r}$ in (3) includes the surface\u2019s reflection coefficients which can, in general, change in time; this particularly holds true for the parts of the surface covered by an RIS with time-varying phase/reflection configuration [1]. We denote the r-th RIS\u2019s reflection vector as $\\mathbf{\u03c3}_r[dT_s] \u2208 C^{M_r\u00d71}$ and the fixed reflection coefficient vector from the rest of the surface as $\\mathbf{\u03b3}_r \u2208 C^{(N_{s,r}-M_r)\u00d71}$, where $N_{s,r} > M_r$. Hence, each $\\mathbf{S}_r[dT_s]$ matrix appearing in (2) is modelled as a diagonal matrix containing the vectors $\\mathbf{\u03c3}_r[dT_s]$ and $\\mathbf{\u03b3}_r$ in its diagonal.\nBy taking the discrete Fourier transform of $\\mathbf{H}_{e2e}[d]$ in (3), the e2e MIMO channel matrix between the BS and UE, and accordingly, the baseband received signal at each k-th subcarrier (k = 0,1,..., K-1) are given respectively as follows:\n\n$\\mathbf{H}_{e2e}[k] =  \\sum_{d=0}^{D-1} \\mathbf{H}_{e2e}[d]e^{-1\\frac{2\u03c0}{K}kd}, $\n\n$\\mathbf{y}[k] = \\mathbf{H}_{e2e}[k]\\mathbf{x}[k] + \\mathbf{n}[k], $\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}[k] \u2208 CN_{ue}$ represents the signal transmitted from the UE and $\\mathbf{n}[k] \u223c CN (0_{N_{bs}\u00d71},\u03c3^2\\mathbf{I}_N)$ models the additive white Gaussian noise, both referring to the k-th subcarrier."}, {"title": "B. Problem Formulation", "content": "The uplink MIMO communication between the UE and the BS takes place on a frame-by-frame basis through the transmission from the former of M OFDM symbols $\\mathbf{X}_m  [\\mathbf{x}_m [1], \\mathbf{x}_m [2],...,\\mathbf{x}_m[K]] \u2208 CN_{ue}\u00d7K$ with m = 1, 2, ..., M per frame We assume that each frame spans a coherent channel block (i.e., all channel paths remain the same throughout each frame transmission duration). Let the integer parameter \u03bc\u2208 [0, M] represent the time instant when the activity of one or more non-cooperative third-party RISs begins. It is assumed that both the value of \u03bc and the characteristics of those RISs (e.g., size and number of elements, placement, phase configuration codebook, reconfiguration frequency, and operation objective) are unknown to either the UE or the BS.\nOur goal, in this paper, is to design a statistical test at the receiver side, i.e., at the BS, that processes the observation matrices $\\mathbf{Y}_1, \\mathbf{Y}_2,..., \\mathbf{Y}_M$ per frame, with $\\mathbf{Y}_m = [\\mathbf{y}_m [1], \\mathbf{y}_m [2], ..., \\mathbf{y}_m[K]] \u2208 CN_{bs}\u00d7K \\forall m$ via (6), in an online manner to detect the presence of any non-cooperative RIS. More specifically, the BS designs a binary online decision rule that monitors all received OFDM symbols (data and/or pilots). In particular, for each m-th OFDM symbol per frame, it formulates the following binary variable:\n\n$\\delta_{m,W} = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{highly probably RIS activity} \\\\ 0, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}, $\n\nwhere W includes learnable parameters, e.g., a neural network. In the next section, we will elaborate on $\\delta_{m,W}$'s structure.\nLet \u03bcw represent the first time where the latter BS rule in (7) outputs the value 1 (i.e., RIS(s) detected). We define the expected RIS activity detection delay as follows:\n\n$P_d(\u03bc_w, \u03bc) \u2261 \u0395[\u03bc_w \u2013 \u03bc], $\n\nas well as the false alarm rate as:\n\n$P_f(\u03bc_w, \u03bc) \u2261 Pr [\u03bc_w < \u03bc|\u03bc \u2192 \u221e]. $\n\nNote that the detection delay is not measured in units of time (e.g., seconds), but in the number of OFDM symbols received under RIS(s)\u2019 presence without any alert.

It is noted that our detection objective can tolerate higher false alarm rates, even if this leads to shorter delays."}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED DSVDD-BASED SCAN B-STATISTIC", "content": "With the advances in graphics and tensor processing units, pre-trained large neural networks can rapidly process high dimensional input data. To this end, enhancing existing statistical tests with neural networks emerges as a promising solution. In addition, there has recently been a lot of progress in pruning methods (see, e.g., [24] and references therein), which can further speed up inference time, in our case, the detection of activity from one or more non-cooperative RISs.\nIn this section, we present a novel unsupervised distribution-free change point detection method, which is termed as dSVDD-scan B-test, for solving OP1. Our RIS activity detection learning method does make any assumption on the structure of the post-change data, and its neural network does not require training with observations affected by non-cooperative RISs. In addition, while our method deploys a variant of the dSVDD model in [19] that is typically used for anomaly detection, we do not attempt to tackle a simple static anomaly detection problem. The stochasticity in the transmitted OFDM symbols and the noise indicates that there will probably be abnormal signal observations at the BS even when UE transmissions are not influenced by the activity of non-cooperative RIS(s).\n       A. The dSVDD Artificial Neural Network Architecture\n       We use the dSVDD model [19] to extract representative and low dimensional features from the BS observations, and then, feed those features to the scan B-statistic [20]. As it will be experimentally verified in the next section, this can greatly enhance the RIS activity detection performance. More specifically, before passing each m-th received OFDM symbol $\\mathbf{Y}_m$ to the neural network, we flatten it and then stack its real and imaginary parts into a $2N_{bs}K \u00d7 1$ real-valued vector $\\mathbf{v}_m$.\n       The dSVDD model, which is a deep learning variant of the SVDD model [18], works by first transforming each input $\\mathbf{v}_m$ to a latent lower dimensional representation $\\mathbf{\u03bb}_m \u2261 g_w(\\mathbf{v}_m) \u2208 R^{N_{LAT}\u00d71}$, where W denotes the parameters of the neural network and $N_{LAT}$ indicates the dimension of the latent space. The model\u2019s outputs $\\mathbf{\u03bb}_m$\u2019s for all normal inputs $\\mathbf{v}_m$\u2019s (i.e., observations unaffected by any RIS activity) will be bounded inside an $N_{LAT}$-dimensional sphere with center $\\mathbf{c} \u2208 R^{N_{LAT}\u00d71}$ and radius R. We define the test for RIS activity within the wireless environment of the MIMO communication system as:\n\n$\\sigma_w(\\mathbf{v}_m) = ||\\mathbf{\u03bb}_m \u2013 \\mathbf{c}||^2  \u2265 R,$\n\nwhere the learnable function $\u03c3_w(\u00b7)$ is known as the anomaly score. In the event that (10) holds true (i.e., $\\mathbf{\u03bb}_m$ lies outside the R-radius sphere), the m-th received OFDM symbol is classified as an anomaly (i.e., affected by unwanted RIS activity).\nTo train our modified dSVDD model hosted at the BS, we construct a large dataset $E$ of actually received OFDM sysmbols (i.e., similar to (6) for large M). This set should include signals unaffected by any unintended RIS activity, constituting in this way the normal inputs to the model. Otherwise, the model will be trained with observations including unintended RIS activity, which will prevent it from detecting similar activity during its deployment phase. Our dSVDD model is then trained over E to solve the following optimization problem [19]:\n\nOP2: $\\min_{R,W} R^2 + \\frac{1}{\u03bb\u03b9|E|} \\sum_{\\mathbf{v}_m\u2208E} max{0, \u03c3_w (\\mathbf{v}_m)-R^2}+\u03bb_2r(W),$\n\nwhere r(\u00b7) is a regularization function on the model\u2019s parameters (e.g., a weight decay regularizer), and \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082 are hyperparameters. The former hyperparameter controls the number of training data points allowed to be outside the sphere (i.e., the number of RIS-affected observations (anomalies) being present in E), while the latter deals with the strength of the regularizer in OP2. The center $\\mathbf{c}$ in (10), and consequently in the problem formulation, is computed by averaging all latent representations within E, whereas the radius R will be learned together with the model\u2019s parameters W. To jointly optimize these variables, we treat them as a single variable and deploy a stochastic gradient descent variant, like the Adam optimizer [25], paired with backpropagation. We will denote by W* the parameters of the trained model.\n       B. RIS Activity Test Statistic\n       The scan B-statistic is typically paired with a kernel function which can make its computation significantly slower [20]. We will instead use the trained model W* to extract low dimensional information, and then, perform the RIS activity test on this information. The key motivation here lies in the fact that the anomaly score\u2019s distribution will change once activity from any non-cooperative RIS takes place.\n       Suppose that the integer value $m_0$ indicates that, up to the $m_0$-th received OFDM symbol, the uplink MIMO communication takes place in the abscence of any non-cooperative RIS activity. To this end, the resulting reference observations $\\mathbf{Y}_1, \\mathbf{Y}_2,..., \\mathbf{Y}_{m_0}$ are first transformed to $\u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_1), \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_2),..., \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_{m_0})$ via the trained neural network. The reference sequence is then split into the $m_\u03c9$ blocks $\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2,..., \\mathcal{S}_{m_\u03c9}$ of length W each, where $m_\u03c9 \u225c \\frac{m_0}{W}$. For instance, $\\mathcal{S}_1 = [\u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_1), \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_2), ..., \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_W)]$. Then, for each m-th received OFDM symbol $\\mathbf{Y}_m$ with m > $m_0$, $\u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_m)$ is obtained that is followed by the generation of a vector including the most recent W observations, i.e.:\n\n$\\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m} = [\u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_{m-W}), \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_{m\u2212W+1}), ..., \u03c3_{w^*}(\\mathbf{v}_{m})].$\n\nFor each of these blocks, we wish to examine whether it differs significantly from each of the latter reference blocks. Therefore, we define the scan B-statistic for each m-th observation as:\n\n$2m_\u03c9^{-1} \\sum_{n=1}^{m_\u03c9}MMD(\\mathcal{S}_n, \\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m}), $\n\nwhere MMD(\u00b7) is an unbiased estimator of the maximum mean discrepancy [20].\nLet k(\u00b7, \u00b7) be a kernel function, e.g., the linear kernel or the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, based on which we define the following function:\n\n$h(x_i, x_j, y_i, y_j) \u225c k(x_i, x_j) + k(y_i, y_j) - k(x_i, y_j) - k(x_j, y_i).$\n\nThe maximum mean discrepancy estimator between any post change block $\\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m}$ and the n-th reference block $\\mathcal{S}_n$ can be obtained by averaging the function h in (12) between all pairs in the former block and all pairs in the latter block, i.e., [26]:\n\n$MMD(\\mathcal{S}_n, \\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m}) = \\frac{1}{W(W \u2013 1)} \\sum_{i \u2260 j}h(\\mathcal{S}_n[i], \\mathcal{S}_n [j], \\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m}[i], \\mathcal{S}_{m-W:m}[j]),$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{S}_n[i]$ denotes the i-th (i = 1, 2, . . ., W) element of $\\mathcal{S}_n$; for instance, $\\mathcal{S}_1[2] = \u03c3(v_2)$. Recall that we have assumed that W* extracts all the necessary information from the model\u2019s"}, {"title": "Input vectors, thus, a linear kernel function suffices.

NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "A. Simulation Setup\n       The intended uplink MIMO OFDM communications take place in a wireless environment with R = 2 planar reflectors. We have set Nue = 10, Nbs = 20, the cyclic prefix length D = 128, the number of propagation paths for all links as Lbs = Lue = Lbs,r = Lr,ue = 4 for r = 1 and 2, as well as Ns,1 = Ns,2 = 400. The transmitted OFDM symbols were independent and identically distributed according to the standard complex Gaussian distribution. We have used the pulse shaping function described in [27, Chapter 2] for the channel model, and varied the number of subcarriers K from 64 to 512.\n       We have considered the following two communication scenarios: i) Central frequency at 3.5 GHz, and ii) Central frequency at 28 GHz, with both the two planar reflectors placed in between the BS and UE at the distance of 3 meters. Both surfaces were simulated as fully static reflectors (i.e., M\u2081 = M2 = 0), with their reflection coefficient given as $\u03b3_r = \u03b3_0 * \\mathbf{1}_{N_{s,1}\u00d71}\u03b4$, where \u03b4 is uniformly distributed in [0.68,0.71]; the latter values for \u03b4 at 28 GHz correspond to indoor dry wall environments [28]. For the environment with the 3.5 GHz communication setup, we have set \u03b4 = 1. In addition, we have set mo = 100 and considered that, after the OFDM symbol with the index \u03bc = 150 has arrived at the BS, the second reflector is coated with an RIS covering its entire surface (i.e., M2 = 400). The first reflector was assumed to be free of any RIS throughout the whole duration of interest. A maximum horizon of M = 500 OFDM symbols was considered for the test statistic to detect the RIS. If the BS could not detect the RIS within this horizon window, we assumed that the designed statistic has missed it. In order to be consistent with most of the available RIS prototypes [13], we assumed that the RIS is equipped with 1-bit phase resolution metamaterials. In particular, during the transmission of each m-th OFDM symbol with m > \u03bc, each RIS element\u2019s value was selected uniformly from {0, \u03c0}.\n       B. Implementation Details and Benchmark Schemes\n       The training dataset E consisted of 60000 observations via (6), and the reference sequence length was set as $m_0$ = 100. For benchmark, we have implemented the classical Hotelling test and the scan B-statistic [20] with a linear kernel performed on the flattened observation arrays $\\mathbf{v}_m \\forall m$. The window length for all test statistics was set as W = 5.\n       We have built our modified dSVDD architecture using the pytorch framework [29]. Our artificial neural network consisted of 4 linear layers, each with a different number of units, which were empirically selected. The number of output units of each layer was 64 \u00d7 20, 64 \u00d7 10, 64 \u00d7 5, and 32. Each layer was followed by a leaky rectified linear unit activation function. Our network\u2019s training was performed using the Adam [25] optimizer with a weight decay of $10^{-4}$ for regularization. Our simulations were conducted on a desktop computer with an 11-th generation Intel Core i7 CPU, 32 GB RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 3080 (10 GB VRAM) GPU.\n       C. Detection Performance Evaluation\n       We have evaluated the average detection delay, the empirical false alarm rate, and the average computation time for all studied RIS activity detection schemes using 1000 Monte-Carlo episodes each with M OFDM symbol transmissions. The latter metric quantifies the average time needed to compute the test statistic during per received OFDM symbol. The communication-dependent threshold \u03b8 in (14) for our dSVDD-scan B test and the benchmark test statistics was selected such that the false alarm rate was at most F = 0.25.\n       Figure 1 includes all detection results with all three compared test statistics for the first communication scenario at 3.5 GHz, while Fig. 2 illustrates the average RIS detection delay performance for the second communication scenario at 28 GHz for different noise levels, but only for the proposed dSVDD-scan B test since RIS detection with the two benchmarks was impossible. As depicted in Fig. 1a for the noise level -120 dB, the proposed dSVDD-scan B-statistic achieves the shortest delay for all K values. In fact, we have seen that, for our method, the delay tends to decrease for large K. In"}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we presented a novel distribution-free change point detection statistic for high dimensional data that does not require a pre-change reference block. Our dSVDD-scan B test was applied to detect non-cooperative activity from one or more RISs with unknown characteristics impacting a point-to-point MIMO OFDM communication system. We also presented a novel wideband channel model incorporating RISs as well as non-reconfigurable stationary surfaces. Our performance evaluations demonstrated that the proposed detection scheme can quickly detect unwanted RIS activity, while being much more computationally efficient than existing detection methods."}]}

One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled mechanical electrophysiological model with several free parameters that are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time. While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration in a bundle.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Neuronal damage caused by mechanical insults is the focus of a wide range of disciplines, ranging from theoretical computational neuroscience to the study of their secondary effects in the biochemical balance of the brain, their resulting mid- to long-term cognitive and motor deficits, to their potential treatment. These insults may vary in intensity and frequency (e.g., explosion blasts, traffic accidents, or repetitive sports related impacts) as well as in their location (e.g., traumatic brain injury vs. spinal cord injury). Additionally, the cascade of events resulting from the mechanical damage has also a timeline of effects that include different forms of tissue degeneration and cell death, e.g., neuronal calcium homeostasis, metabolism alterations or physiological dysfunction [1, 2, 3]. This paper focuses on the short-term effects caused by the mechanical damage through the simulation of the mechanically induced damage of the electrophysiology of the signal transmission in axons. To this end, we consider here the calibration of an individual axonal transmission and then extend it to the analysis of the simulation of a whole nerve.\nThe complexity of the coupling between mechanics and electrophysiology requires the identification of many parameters. Some of these parameters may be obtained by controlled experimental studies as reported in the literature, but many other parameters are not readily available in such tests. Nonetheless, some experimental studies offer a valuable set of controlled cases in which meso- or macroscale effects can be measured [4, 5, 6]. The challenge is to identify those unknown values for the corresponding free parameters that (after simulation) show the results that best approximate the reference experimental studies.\nTo accomplish this objective, and given the impossibility of exhaustively"}, {"title": "2. Preliminaries", "content": "exploring all the possible interactions among these parameters, we propose the use of a parallel implementation of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm [7], a metaheuristic algorithm that has been previously successfully used to solve complex scientific and engineering problems [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. This parallel implementation makes use of the OpenMP API to speed up the evaluation of each candidate solution, as this is the most time-comsuming part of the algorithms due to the nature of the fitness function, which requires to run a complete simulation of the electrophysiological model. Alternatively, GPUs could also be used to parallelize the algorithm, as they have already exhibited excellent performance for this kind of problems [14, 15, 16, 17], see Section 5.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 briefly reviews past related work. In Section 3, we present the simplified single axon problem for the tuning of the optimization framework. We provide a formulation of the problem in Section 3.1, a description of the experimental scenario under study and the parameter tuning carried out in Section 3.2 and the results and most relevant findings for this first simulation experiment in Section 3.3. Then, the more realistic multi-axon calibration problem is presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this work.\nThe effects of the traumatic damage in either the brain (traumatic brain injury, TBI) or the spinal cord (spinal cord injury, SCI) are actually the product of a sequence of events [18]. Firstly, the direct damage produced by the mechanical insult disrupts cells in the region where the mechanical load is applied; secondly, complex regulatory mechanisms are activated that may also cause the degradation of the affected area or even nearby tissue. This potentially leads to cell impairment at the functional level, or even cell death [19, 20]. The way the different effects triggered in this second phase interact and contribute to the degradation process of both TBI and SCI is still a matter of debate. Among these secondary pathophysiology consequences, the most relevant (but not the only ones) are [2]:\n\u2022 The massive release of glutamate producing excitotoxicity that induces excessive activation of glutamate receptors, leading to further neuronal cell death [21, 3, 22],"}, {"title": "2.1.

For instance, neurons are more vulnerable to excitotoxicity derived from parthanatos, but glial cells are more affected by metabolic perturbations producing ischemic/hypoxic apoptosis [18].\nThe experimental studies by Shi et al. [6] set out to measure the changes in compound action potential (CAP) amplitude before and after different levels and rates of traumatising stretch of guinea pig spinal cord white matter. The pre-stretch CAP was measured in a double sucrose gap, an experimental rig with three chambers. The ends of the spinal cord segment were placed in two end-chambers, submerged in intracellular ionic solution, while the rest of the spinal cord segment lays in the middle chamber submerged in an extracellular solution. The chambers were separated by concentrated sucrose, acting as a high impedance partition. One of the end chambers had a stimulating electrode to induce action potentials (AP) in the spinal cord segment. The resulting signal can then be measured as a potential difference between the middle and the other end chamber with electrodes, see Figure 1.\nIn addition to this set-up, an impacting rod was used in the middle chamber to impose different levels and rates of traumatising stretches, while the CAP was then measured continuously after stretch for up to 30 min."}, {"title": "2.2.

NEURITE [62], one of the earliest software dedicated to the cell scale is used here as the underlying simulator of nerve damage.\nSimulation model calibration is an open research area that has always been dependent on the characteristics of the simulation mechanisms to calibrate. Numerical approaches use properties of the simulation mechanics to identify optimal parameters but are limited to the analytical study of the derivable and continuity properties of the function to optimize. When such numerical approach cannot be carried out, estimation approaches attempt to find a good (maybe not optimal calibration) by indirect methods. Independent parameter calibration can be performed by means of methods such as sensitive analysis [66, 67], whereas multiple interdependent parameters require approaches used in experiment design, such as Taguchi's method [68]. When the number and the complexity of the relationships among the parameters grow, a global optimization approach is required. Although one of the most commonly used techniques for the global calibration of simulated models is Monte Carlo approaches [69] (through in-biased random sampling the parameter space) the search of the optimal calibration of parameters requires a guided search strategy."}, {"title": "3.

Recently, hybrid heuristic optimization approaches have also been used for the calibration of computational simulation models, for instance, multiple offspring sampling [79], or memetic algorithms [80].\nIn this work we have selected DE, which has already been used in the parameter calibration of several simulation models [81, 82].

[61] accounts for the visco-elastoplastic deformation of the axons embedded in a viscous extracellular matrix. The electrophysiological model simulates impulse transmission using Cable Theory for the myelinated internodal regions (IR) and the Hodgkin-Huxley model for the nodes of Ranvier (NR) in myelinated axons [42, 83]. NEURITE couples both models by a) accounting for the geometrical membrane alterations ensuing from mechanical deformation, and b) potential damage in ion channels as observed experimentally through the so-called sodium ion channel left-shift [84], see Ref. [61] for more details. Figure 3 shows both coupled models integrated in the simulation of the traumatic axonal damage.\nFollowing some assumptions on the electrophysiological parameters, the resulting coupled model was left with six free parameters that need to be adjusted.

These six combinations define the damage cases under study. For each of the damage cases, the simulation calculates the AP originated from one fixed transmitted signal at the beginning of the axon at a point further down the axon. These signal transmissions are recorded at seven different time-points (just after the mechanical insult and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after). For a given time-point and a given loading case, the final output consist of the ratio of the maximum recorded AP amplitude for this damaged case to the maximum recorded amplitude for the undamaged case (1 means no damage, 0 means completely damaged). These AP ratios are then compared to the CAP from the experiments (see Ref. [61] for more details about the assumptions).\nA graphical representation on how this ratio (%CAP) is computed is given in Figure 4, where a sample damage case simulation is compared to its reference healthy counterpart through the following equation:\n\\%CAP_{ij} = \\frac{\\mbox{(damage}_{ij}\\mbox{)} }{\\mbox{healthy}_{ij}} * 100\\quad(1)\nThe model is then contrasted with the measures obtained by the experimental measurements of the damaged to undamaged CAP ratio propagation under the same loading conditions [6] (see Figure 2).\nIt is worth emphasizing that this original approach proposed in Ref. [61, 62] suffers from two important limitations: i) it only considers one axon, and ii) the signal is triggered by one unique impulse which plays a double role: pushing the potentially unstable resting potential resting potential (due to the damage alteration) towards its new naturally stable (if there is one) resting potential and providing the signal to be measured for the test (see Figure 4 where the tail of the damaged signal is not at the same level as before it is triggered). Ideally, one would want to send a train of signal to change the resting potential, and then only measure the signal. While this will be done in the more realistic bundle scenario in the next section, those two approximations are kept to speed up the simulations and identify the optimization parameters of the optimization framework.\nThe problem of finding the best parameters values for the electrophysiologicalmechanical model described in Section 3.1.1 can be formulated as a global continuous optimization problem. This kind of problems involve the minimization or maximization of a specific objective/fitness function. In the"}, {"title": "3.2. Simulation setup and parameter tuning", "content": "remainder of this paper, we consider the minimization case, without loss of generality.

Due to this computing-time constraint, the parameter tuning of the algorithm had to be limited in terms of number of the considered configurations, see Table 4, where the values finally selected after 25 independent runs are provided in bold. In particular, two different crossover operators were tested (binomial and exponential), two population sizes (preferring the smallest one of the two) and two values for"}, {"title": "3.3. Results", "content": "the weighting factor F and the crossover constant CR [7]. An exhaustive grid search was conducted on the eight possible combinations of these three parameters values. The final DE strategy used in our simulations is thus the de/rand/1/exp.\nThe bottleneck of the optimization algorithm for this model calibration problem is the fitness function, which requires the execution of a simulation with the parameters values encoded in the candidate solution. For this reason, we decided to use the OpenMP2 API to parallelize the computation of the fitness function. As shown in Equation (3), computing the fitness of a solution involves the summatory of the differences between simulated and experimental CAPs for each of the damage cases and time points. In our simulations, this means that 42 threads (six damage cases and seven time points) could eventually run in parallel.\nMoreover, DE, as other metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms, is a population-based algorithm, which means that, at each iteration, it maintains a population of candidate solutions. As solutions can be evaluated independently, the parallel implementation of DE that we are using can run 42 \u00d7 NP processes concurrently, where NP represents the population size used by the DE algorithm. Of course, the actual number of concurrent threads will be limited by the available number of cores and we can expect a linear speedup compared to the sequential execution time reported in the previous section. In our case, we are limited by the configuration of the hardware platform used for the experiments to a maximum of 16 concurrent threads (see Table 3 for details).\nThe model calibration was conducted in two steps, so as to study the dependencies between the values of some of the variables. In the first step, we considered the search space intervals for the free parameters of the model reported in Table 5.\nFigure 5a compares the simulation results of a representative calibration obtained with the DE algorithm (DE model 1) against the experimental results reported in Ref. [6]. As can be seen, the model is able to capture quite accurately the behavior the mild cases (both slow and fast) and reasonably well the moderate cases (again, both slow and fast) except at time 10 min for the moderate-fast case and times 5 and 10 min for the moderate-slow case. If we compare these results with those of the manual calibration shown in Figure 5b, we can see how the automatic calibration is able to obtain better results than the manual calibration for most of the cases. This is especially true for the mild damage cases and, in particular, for the mild-fast case. It is interesting to note how the model is still not able to fit the severe cases. This potentially arises for the extreme sensibility of the signal collapse for large damage, see Ref. [62, 61], and the simplification of the triggering signal.\nAs can be seen in Table 5, the maximum possible value for the Neq parameter is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the E parameter. This has an important effect on the simulation in terms of how the steady state can be reached. This can be clearly seen if we run again the optimization algorithm constraining the search space for the Neg from [106, 108] to [106, 107] (DE model 2). The results of this new scenario are shown in Table 6: the DE algorithm is able to minimize to very low values the error made. A closer look reveals that, for many of the damage cases and times, this error"}, {"title": "3.4. Comparison with other optimization algorithms", "content": "is almost zero, as will be shown graphically later. Compared with the results of the manual calibration [62] (also shown in Table 6) we can observe that even the worst run of the DE algorithm obtains significantly better fitness than the manual calibration. Furthermore, the best result of DE is twice as good as the manually calibrated one.\nFigure 5c depicts another representative execution for this second batch of runs with the constrained search space for the neq parameter of the model. It can be observed how the model fails then to capture time 5 min for the moderate-fast case and worsens its ability to fit the same time instant for the mild-fast case.\nFigure 6 depicts the relationship between fitness values and each of the parameters of the coupled mechanical-electrophysiological model. From this analysis, several observations can be made:\n1. There does not seem to be any dominant attribute in the fitness function. Only and k seem to be biased, in both cases, to small values of these parameters. On the other hand, what we have instead is a high degree of interaction among the parameters (high epistasis). Such epistasis is in agreement with the physical interpretation of the free parameters optimized here, where each of them is aimed at representing the mechanical properties of the axon, see Ref. [61].\n2. The optimization algorithm is able to find very low fitness values, as mentioned before. The search also progresses during the whole execution, which could mean that and additional budget of fitness evaluations would allow the algorithm to find even better solutions.\n3. There is a noticeable horizontal line at a fitness value of around 240. We hypothesize that this could be a basin of attraction (with a large neutral neighbourhood). However, more experiments are needed to assess any of those hypotheses.\nFigures 7 and 8 provide an alternative perspective on the simulation results by comparing the results of the reference calibration with those of the manual and automatic calibrations. In these plots, there are several things that should be highlighted. First, the automatic calibration is able to reach an almost perfect fit for both mild cases for all the time instants, except at\nTo assess the performance of DE as the optimizer for our problem, we have conducted a comparison with two other methods: (1) a gradient-based optimizer, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm [85]; and (2) a more advanced DE-based algorithm, the Success History based DE with Linear Population Size Reduction (LSHADE) [86]. The objective of this comparison is two-fold. On the one hand, we want to ensure that a population-based metaheuristic needs to be used and that a simpler gradientbased method is not powerful enough for this complex problem. On the other hand, we want to check if a more sophisticated algorithm such as LSHADE can yield even better results than DE. To allow for a fair comparison, we have run both algorithms for the same number of maximum fitness evaluations as DE.\nexperiment is too small for the algorithm to obtain enough information for this self-adjustment to take place. This is no surprise, as we have previously observed this behaviour in other self-adaptive algorithms [87, 88].\nGiven that the axonal bundle study will share most of the characteristics of the single axon problem, we will use DE as the optimizer of choice for the remainder of this paper."}, {"title": "4. Axonal bundle study", "content": "time 0 min. Second, the automatic calibration obtains better results for all the cases and times except for mild-fast damage case at time 0 min and the moderate-slow at all the time points. Finally, none of the calibrations is able to fit the severe damage cases. This discrepancy might find its roots in the following: i) only one axon was used in the simulation setup (as opposed to the setup that makes use of a bundle of axons), and ii) as discussed earlier, the electrical signal is triggered without a preconditioning of the new axon, i.e., the damage might lead to a new resting potential that can only be reached by first disturbing the axon; after which, the signal to be measured can be sent; in the previous setup, only the latter was done. Those two points are tackled in the following.\nIn Section 3, the model by Jerusalem et al. [61] of the altered axonal electrophysiology caused by mechanical stretch was wrapped within a parallel DE optimization framework to obtain a calibration of its parameters; outperforming the manual calibration originally carried out in Ref. [61]. It is however unclear whether the overall CAP of a segment of spinal cord tissue post-stretch (as measured experimentally by Shi et al. [6]) can be modelled by the AP of one unique axon (such as the model by Jerusalem et al. [61]). Additionally, the axonal resting potential requires first a rebalancing before the transmitted signal can be tracked. While this can simply be done by sending first a signal to obtain the new resting potential before sending the signal to be tracked, this was avoided in both the manual and automatic calibration presented above. This section therefore sets out to explore the modelling of altered macroscopic electrophysiology of a bundle of axons in a more realistic way.\nSection 4.1 proposes an extension framework for extrapolating axon bundle electrophysiology from individual axon electrophysiology, based on the mechanical-electrophysiological single axon model used earlier. The extended framework is then linked with the previously tuned parallel DE algorithm to perform systematic parameter search to obtain the best calibration against the experimental reference."}, {"title": "4.1.

However, wide ranging geometrical variations are observed within the axon population of a fibre [89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95]. The characteristics of one AP are reflective of the conduction properties of the axon of interest, in turn dependent on its geometrical features [96], such as diameter, nodes of Ranvier sizes or internodal lengths. Previous morphometric studies of axons observed variances in all the aforementioned geometrical parameters [90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95]. Furthermore, a normal distribution was observed in axon calibres for different species, such as rats and guinea pigs [89, 97]. The g-ratio (the ratio of inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter [96, 98]) is a good indicator of axonal myelination and when assuming a constant inner axonal diameter and myelin layer thickness, the number of myelin layers can be estimated.

In terms of mechanically induced electrophysiology deficits, it is desirable to study the relationship between a population's geometrical characteristics and one hypothetical representative characteristic. The need for a collective behaviour within an axonal bundle may hypothetically be rationalised through the need for signal redundancy. The rest of this section therefore details a framework for extending NEURITE up to an axonal fibre model, by taking into account realistic geometrical characteristics.\nIn order to create the fibre model, morphometric relationships for guinea pig axonal calibre, internodal length and number of myelin layers were obtained from Hilderbrand et al.[101].\nLinear fits were used to approximate the relationship between internodal lengths and the number of myelin layers, and between internodal lengths and axon diameter\nThe internodal length was estimated to be 100 times the axon calibre [101]. The smallest diameter in the fibre model was estimated to be 0.7 \u00b5m [89], and therefore the smallest internodal length was determined to be 70 \u00b5m. The number of myelin layers were estimated to be 12 times the diameter value of the axon calibre in micrometres (the slope in Figure 9b)[101].\nIn the experiments conducted in a double sucrose gap [6], the spinal cord segment were over-stimulated with a large voltage, therefore one assumption was that the axons recruited in the CAP reflects the axon population within the cord segment. There are numerous axons within the experimental sample, and it would be impractical and computationally expensive to simulate all of them. Figure 10 presents the reported diameter distribution for the guinea pig spinal cord [6].\nIn order to simplify the model to a representative population, the data from Figure 10 were taken to extract the relative ratios of the different diameter bins in the histogram. One set of diameters was used and a random diameter within each bin was chosen by a random number generator. Each internode was assigned a length and a number of myelin layers within the range corresponding to its diameter generated by a random number generator. Two axons were used to approximate the smallest histogram bin (axon diameter of 5-6 \u00b5m), and the number of axons per bin for the other bins was chosen proportionally. The minimum number of axons to approximate this population was hence determined to be 27: six axons under 2.5 \u00b5m, five between 2.5-3 \u00b5m, ten between 3-4 \u00b5m, four between 4-5 \u00b5m and two between 5-6 \u00b5m. Random diameters within each bin were generated to form\nThe fibre model that was evaluated in this simulation is made up of 27 axons and the aforementioned scaling framework is used to produce a \u0421\u0410\u0420. In order to compare the effectiveness the 27-axon bundle, the simulated fibre had a length of 10 mm, the same as for the simulations presented by Jerusalem et al. [61]. The electrophysiological parameters of each axon was assumed to be the same and the parameters reported in Jerusalem et al. [61] were used in this study.\nTo trigger the APs, three voltage stimuli of duration 3 ms were used in this study (as opposed to a single stimulus as used by Jerusalem et al. [61] and used earlier for the optimization of the DE parameters). First, the fibre was triggered twice in quick succession one after the other (at time t=20 ms and t=33 ms), then at t=150ms the fibre was triggered again. The reason to adopt this pattern was that it was often observed that a new resting potential can be established for some of the loading cases (especially Cases 3 and 4). Therefore the first two triggers were used to establish a new stable resting potential before an AP was recorded. Without this triggering system, post stretch CAP for Cases 3 and 4 can have abnormally large amplitudes, since it is possible for the damaged nerve to establish a new resting potential. From a model point of view, allowing the HodgkinHuxley model to first establish a new resting potential by triggering it, then triggering it again for an AP is closer to what is measured experimentally. The total simulation time was 300 ms, this was chosen to be long enough to observe all APs initiated by the three triggers. Note that Vrest = -65 mV in all simulations in this study.\nFitness is computed analogously as for the one-axon case.

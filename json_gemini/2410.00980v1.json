{"title": "HETEROGENEOUS SOUND CLASSIFICATION WITH\nTHE BROAD SOUND TAXONOMY AND DATASET", "authors": ["Panagiota Anastasopoulou", "Jessica Torrey", "Xavier Serra", "Frederic Font"], "abstract": "Automatic sound classification has a wide range of applications in\nmachine listening, enabling context-aware sound processing and\nunderstanding. This paper explores methodologies for automati-\ncally classifying heterogeneous sounds characterized by high intra-\nclass variability. Our study evaluates the classification task using\nthe Broad Sound Taxonomy, a two-level taxonomy comprising 28\nclasses designed to cover a heterogeneous range of sounds with se-\nmantic distinctions tailored for practical user applications. We con-\nstruct a dataset through manual annotation to ensure accuracy, di-\nverse representation within each class and relevance in real-world\nscenarios. We compare a variety of both traditional and modern\nmachine learning approaches to establish a baseline for the task of\nheterogeneous sound classification. We investigate the role of in-\nput features, specifically examining how acoustically derived sound\nrepresentations compare to embeddings extracted with pre-trained\ndeep neural networks that capture both acoustic and semantic in-\nformation about sounds. Experimental results illustrate that audio\nembeddings encoding acoustic and semantic information achieve\nhigher accuracy in the classification task. After careful analysis of\nclassification errors, we identify some underlying reasons for failure\nand propose actions to mitigate them. The paper highlights the need\nfor deeper exploration of all stages of classification, understanding\nthe data and adopting methodologies capable of effectively handling\ndata complexity and generalizing in real-world sound environments.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

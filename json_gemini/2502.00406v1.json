{"title": "ALU: Agentic LLM Unlearning", "authors": ["Debdeep Sanyal", "Murari Mandal"], "abstract": "Information removal or suppression in large language models (LLMs) is a desired functionality, useful in Al regulation, legal compliance, safety, and privacy. LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (ALU) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our ALU framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and ALU seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that ALU consistently stands out as the most robust LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring a low constant-time cost. We further highlight ALU'S superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, ALU is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The downstream applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) have skyrocketed over the last few years, owing to their capability to learn, and sometimes memorize massive text corpora (Grattafiori et al., 2024), (Team, 2024), (Achiam et al., 2023), (Team et al., 2024a). However, this also raises concerns of copyright infringement (Karamolegkou et al., 2023), (Henderson et al., 2023), privacy (Staab et al., 2024), (Ippolito et al., 2023), and spreading of hazardous information (Li et al., 2024), (Harandizadeh et al., 2024), (Fang et al., 2024) to name a few. Regulatory guidelines (Legislative, 2023), (OAG, 2021), (Union, 2016), have been introduced to safeguard user data, mandating corporations to remove data on demand. To address this, organizations need methodologies without requiring model retraining on an edited corpus, and machine unlearning (Xu et al., 2024a), (Chundawat et al., 2023a), (Tarun et al., 2024), (Chundawat et al., 2023b) has emerged as a paradigm for its ability to meet this need effectively.\nUnlearning specific pieces of information in multi-billion parameter LLM models comes with a lot of challenges such as catastrophic forgetting in models due to gradient updates (Aghajanyan et al., 2020), (Zhang et al., 2024a), (Gu et al., 2024) and vulnerability to adversarial attacks on the model (Anil et al., 2024), (Schwinn et al., 2024). Moreover, the limited access to model weights in many cases poses significant challenges to the effectiveness of conventional unlearning methods (Neel et al., 2020).\nEffective unlearning in LLMs requires a balance of unlearning efficacy, response quality, robustness, and efficiency. Recent research has explored methods without retraining (Achiam et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2022) to unlearn certain information in LLMs. A majority of the existing research in LLM unlearning focuses on parameter fine-tuning the base LLM (Wang et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024; Eldan & Russinovich, 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Jia et al., 2024) leveraging a forget dataset to remove the information present in it, and a retain dataset to maintain model utility. (Pawelczyk et al., 2023) introduced in-context unlearning without making any changes to the model parameters, and similar attempts (Thaker et al., 2024) have since been made towards achieving unlearning efficacy comparable with the gradient-based approaches."}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Optimization-based unlearning. Most studies on unlearning in LLMs target weight manipulation (Yao et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024c; Jang et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2024). This approach revolves around maximizing the negative log-likelihood function over a sequence of tokens. Although this approach is promising, altering weights often compromises other aspects, like model utility in general. (Liu et al., 2024c) points out how gradient ascent (Yao et al., 2024) generates gibberish since updating weights does not allow one to have precise control over topics being unlearned and retained. To counter this issue to some extent, recent methods perform the unlearning training on a forget set, along with a separate representative retain set, which prevents the model from catastrophic forgetting (Liu et al., 2024c; Maini et al., 2024; Sinha et al., 2024). This approach works in preserving the model utility at the cost of training time and compute. In the case of large LLMs, we don't have access to the full dataset. Thus, these methods are bound to fail in maintaining retain utility after model weight alteration. Altering the prediction loss (Zhang et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024c) with a subset of this paradigm focusing on minimizing some form of KL divergence between a teacher distribution and the distribution of a student model (Liu et al., 2024c) are some other methods.\nPost hoc unlearning. These methods aim to achieve unlearning without requiring access to LLM weights (Pawelczyk et al., 2023), significantly reducing time and compute compared to optimization-based approaches.

Agentic LLM Unlearning", "content": "We introduce ALU as illustrated in Figure 1, the first agentic pipeline for fine-grained unlearning in LLMs. ALU employs four specialized agents to ensure both effective unlearning and preserved response utility. Operating as a black box, ALU requires only the user query and a list of unlearning targets at inference time. The agents process the response sequentially using few-shot prompting. The four agents comprising ALU are:\n\u2022 Vanilla agent. This agent resembles a standard language model without any unlearning framework. Provided with the prompt Q, the vanilla agent responds with an answer R that may potentially contain references to one or multiple subjects from the unlearning target set. The inclusion of the vanilla agent serves two critical objectives.\n  Circumventing Jailbreaking: The vanilla agent acts like a shock-absorber in our framework, nullifying the influences of adversarial prompts (Lynch et al., 2024) or state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques (Anil et al., 2024) due to the inherent design of the framework to not suppress any information in the first place.\n  Improves on Guardrailing: The initial state of our framework in the absence of the vanilla agent closely resembles guardrailing techniques (Thaker et al., 2024). However, we empirically demonstrate through various experiments in Section 4 that guardrailing is brittle to adversarial prompts. Including the vanilla agent makes our framework more robust against such attacks.\n\u2022 AuditErase agent Once we have the response R from the vanilla response, the AuditErase agent Mf takes the first step towards fine-grained unlearning. This agent decomposes the task of unlearning into two phases - identification of the targets To within Rr with a potential reference of target t in the forget set T, and generating the first draft of the unlearned responses Rf by eliminating references of Tv from R.\nRf = {ri = Mf (Rv, t) | t \u2208 Tv, i = 1, . . ., k}\nThe decomposition of the unlearning task and generating k different unlearned responses allows for fine-grained unlearning, addressing knowledge entanglement (Liu et al., 2024a) and boosts model utility. We choose k = 5 for our framework and illustrate the effect on unlearning efficacy and model utility with different values of k in Figure 2.\n\u2022 Critic agent Most unlearning frameworks lack a fallback mechanism in cases where the unlearning fails (Pawelczyk et al., 2023; Thaker et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a;c). To address this limitation, we include a critic agent Mc with GPT-40 as the critic to ensure an unbiased and a thorough evaluation of the responses. This agent acts as a safety net, analyzing responses ri \u2208 Rf and assigning a score s \u2208 [1,5]. The score reflects the effectiveness of the unlearning process, considering both the removal of Tu and preservation of response utility. This discourages the model from responding with passive responses like \"I cannot answer that question\" in cases where the vanilla response R can be reformatted to remove any reference to T while maintaining the relevant information. Hence, for each response ri, we have a score si quantifying the unlearning effectiveness of the response.\nS = {s | s = Mc(r,Tv,T), r \u2208 Rf, s \u2208 [1,5]}\n\u2022 Composer agent The critic agent generates the response-rating pairs (ri, si)|i = 1,2,\u2026\u2026,k, which now serves as an input to the composer agent. The composer agent then considers the Top-j responses based on the corresponding ratings and computes the mean score S from the j ratings. If S is beyond a predefined threshold, the composer agent analyzes the j responses and identifies the best aspects regarding response utility and unlearning efficacy for each of the j responses. These aspects are then leveraged to compose the final response Rfinal. In case S does not satisfy the threshold, Rfinal is set to a passive response & like \u201cI am sorry, I cannot respond to that\". This pipeline ensures that Rfinal leaks no information pertaining to the targets in T while aiming to maximize the response utility."}, {"title": "4.

We conduct extensive experiments and show that ALU consistently outperforms existing optimization-based and post hoc state-of-the-art methods across model sizes and perturbations. Notably, we highlight the importance of scalability in unlearning frameworks for their deployment in the real world and exhibit the superior performance of ALU against other methods when scaled to 1000 unlearning targets. We are excited to witness the progress of agentic frameworks in unlearning and further research to improve on the overall architecture, response utility, and tackling entangled subjects, given the proof of their efficacy in our work."}, {"title": "A. Appendix", "content": "A.1. Agentic vs Non-Agentic Unlearning\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first exploration of agentic unlearning. In Table 6, we highlight the key improvements to the core principles underpinning any unlearning framework. These improvements are not exclusive to our implementation of agentic unlearning and are expected to apply more broadly to any unlearning method that incorporates agentic principles.\nALU exhibits low constant-time complexity concerning the number of unlearning targets, as demonstrated in Table 5 since each of the agents requires a relatively fixed amount of time to analyze the prior request and provide their response. While ICUL demonstrates higher efficiency for fewer targets, its execution time exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the number of targets. Optimization-based methods are costlier since they involve training the model on the specific loss for every new target added to the forget set. While ALU does not scale in time with increasing unlearning targets, the execution time scales with the number of agents involved in the framework.\nALU poses virtually no risk of information leakage. Throughout Section 4, we evaluate ALU on multiple datasets, under various perturbations, model sizes (see Table 3), and scaling of the forget set. However, under no setting do we observe any indirect leakage of information pertaining to the unlearning targets with ALU, ensuring negligible risk of information leakage. This preservation of the fundamental principle of unlearning can be attributed to the design of our framework. Instead of having a guardrailing agent, which we found inefficient (Thaker et al., 2024), we decomposed the deletion of information into three distinct stages. We empirically find it a lot more effective to leverage chain of thoughts (Wei et al., 2023) to analyze the response from the vanilla agent, identify and isolate the presence of a target in the response, and then systematically remove it while aiming at maximizing the response utility. This approach is still effective when there is no direct reference to the target since the AuditErase agent gets to analyze the vanilla response in the context of the user query. Once the target is identified, removing its presence from the response is trivial.\nALU preserves utility for unrelated queries. For queries unrelated to unlearning targets, the response from the vanilla agent flows down the entire pipeline without any modifications, rendering no effect on the framework. Even in certain rare cases with smaller LLMs where the AuditErase agent might hallucinate the presence of a target in the response (refer to Section A.2 for more details), this information is re-verified while removing the presence of the mentioned target. The forget set, along with the entire context of the user query and the vanilla response, is subjected to a sec-"}, {"title": "A.2. Sensitivity of Agentic Unlearning", "content": "While Section 4 highlights the superior performance of agentic unlearning and its practical viability, an area of improvement has been identified. Our evaluation in Table 3 indicates that Llama-3.2 3B, when used as the base model for ALU, exhibits suboptimal performance compared to other models, with the performance gap increasing with a growing forget set. Although no information leakage pertaining to unlearning targets is detected, an increase in the number of false positives has been observed. This behavior, wherein the smaller base model tends to suppress information even for targets not included in the forget set while technically adhering to unlearning principles, negatively impacts the model's overall utility. To evaluate the impact of this behavior, a forget set containing 75 targets sourced from TOFU (Maini et al., 2024) was established, along with a list of 100 questions, ensuring no correlation with the targets in the forget set. Ideally, these questions should be answered as if no unlearning mechanism were implemented. Figure 5 compares the performance of ALU on seven models of sizes varying from 2B to 70B (Team et al., 2024b; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team, 2024) on the aforementioned setting, revealing that the 3B model exhibited seven false positives within a batch of 100 questions. While this loss in model utility for a small LLM might seem insignificant compared to other methods in Figure 3, we consider this an area of improvement in agentic unlearning frameworks.\nWe assume a black-box setting where users have no access to the internal workings of our framework. As all response processing occurs within the agent system during inference, adversaries could potentially exploit access to these agents to manipulate them and circumvent the unlearning filters. We consider this a realistic assumption in practical settings and"}, {"title": "A.3. Practicality of post hoc unlearning", "content": "There is no \"true way\" of unlearning. A vast majority of the community focusing on machine unlearning has considered optimization-based methods to be the only \"true\" way of unlearning (Maini et al., 2024), (Liu et al., 2024b), (Zhang et al., 2023) since post hoc methods do not remove the information to be unlearned from the base model. However, the latest advances in test-time computations in large language models, which allow them to reason better with inference-level modifications (Snell et al., 2024), (Wei et al., 2023), (Wang et al., 2023c), challenge this long-held assumption. Methods like (Mangaokar et al., 2024) stand outdated with the latest models (Grattafiori et al., 2024), (Team, 2024), (Abdin et al., 2024b) which are a lot more robust to such perturbations. Moreover, Section 4.3 highlights how ALU is robust against the state-of-the-art jailbreaking methods. The fundamental principle of an unlearning framework is to prevent any leakage of information pertaining to the unlearning targets without affecting the intrinsic capabilities of the base model. This principle can be conceptualized as a switch activated only when the model encounters references to any unlearning target, remaining inactive otherwise. A"}, {"title": "A.4.

In this work, we propose Entropy-UID, a new token selection method that balances entropy and Uniform Information Density (UID) principles for enhanced efficiency of text generation. Our approach adaptively adjusts token selection by jointly minimizing entropy and surprisal, promoting more even information distribution across generated sequences. Theoretical validation demonstrates that Entropy-UID optimally reduces information spikes while maintaining fluency and coherence. The method has been evulated using information-theoretic metrics on multiple benchmark datasets, including WikiText-2, OpenWebText, and WMT. Experimental results show that Entropy-UID achieves lower surprisal and entropy variance compared to standard GPT-2 and alternative heuristics, leading to more balanced and human-like text generation. Our findings point towards the potential of leveraging information-theoretic constraints to refine token selection strategies in autoregressive language models.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The quality of outputs for tasks such as text summarization, machine translation, and conversational AI hinges on the ability to balance fluency, coherence, and diversity. Despite advances in natural language processing (NLP), the generated output in current frameworks are characterized by repetition, incoherent phrasing, or uneven information density that reduce overall utility. Addressing these challenges requires utilizing basic linguistic and information-theoretic principles to effectively guide generation processes.\nInformation entropy, introduced by Shannon (1948), measures the uncertainty or complexity within a probability distribution. In NLP, entropy serves as a critical metric to measure the unpredictability of word or phrase choices. A higher value in entropy indicates higher diversity but may risk incoherence, while a lower value could lead to repetitive or overly deterministic output. On the other hand, the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis(Frank and Jaeger, 2008) states that speakers and writers uniformly distribute information density in utterances for an end of optimizing communication. UID postulates that local spikes in information density disrupt processing efficiency, fostering linguistic structures maintaining smoother distributions.\nExisting research on NLP has explored entropy and UID independently. Entropy-based approaches explored the diversity and mitigate degenerative text patterns in generation tasks(Holtzman et al., 2019), and the impact for anticipating on reading times(Pimentel et al., 2023). UID has been widely used in text generation(See et al., 2017), word omission(Rabinovich, 2024), and speaking tasks(Jaeger and Levy, 2006; Aylett and Turk, 2006). However, the integration of these two principles into a unified framework remains underexplored, particularly in their complementary roles for optimizing both global diversity and local coherence.\nIn this paper, we propose Entropy-UID, a novel method combining the strengths of entropy and UID in order to optimize information density for generative tasks. Our approach dynamically balances global complexity and local fluency by selecting tokens based on their entropy and surprisal values. Thus, by aligning these principles, we aim to produce outputs that are not only contextually coherent but also evenly distributed in terms of information density.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on text and speech generation tasks, comparing Entropy-UID with baseline models and single-principle optimization strategies (e.g., entropy-only or UID-only). Our results demonstrate that Entropy-UID consistently improves output quality by generating sequences that are more natural, contextually aligned, and well-balanced in terms of information density. This work bridges the gap between two foundational concepts in language generation, offering a practical and scalable framework for modern NLP systems."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "2.1 Information Entropy\nInformation entropy(Shannon, 1948) states that any information has redundancy, and the size of the redundancy is related to the probability or uncertainty of each symbol (number, letter or word) in the information.\nEntropy Entropy measures the unpredictability of a token given its context:\n$H(s\\C) = - \\sum_i P(s_i|C) \\log P(s_i|C)$,\nwhere $P(s_i|C)$ is the probability of token $s_i$ given the context C. Higher entropy reflects greater diversity.\n2.2 Uniform Information Density Hypothesis\nThe UID hypothesis posits that speakers optimize the communicative properties of their utterances by avoiding spikes in information, thereby maintaining a relatively uniform information profile over time. An example is Florian Jaeger (2010) found that speakers are more likely to include optional elements, such as \"that\" in English subordinate clauses, when local information density increases.\nSurprisal Surprisal quantifies the unexpectedness of a token based on its likelihood:\n$Surprisal(s|C) = - \\log P(s|C)$.\nTokens with lower surprisal values align better with the UID principle by maintaining smoother information density.\n2.3 Combining Entropy and UID in Language Generation\nWhile entropy and UID have been independently studied in various NLP tasks, their integration as complementary principles for generation optimization is a novel direction. Existing work has primarily focused on either enhancing diversity through entropy-based methods or achieving uniformity via UID. Our approach bridges this gap by leveraging both principles to achieve fluency, coherence, and balanced information density in generated outputs"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Algorithm Overview: Our proposed method integrates entropy and UID principles into a unified framework for optimizing information density during sequence generation. The core idea is to balance global diversity (entropy) with local uniformity (UID) by evaluating candidate tokens at each generation step using two key metrics:\nOptimization Objective The algorithm evaluates these metrics for each candidate token and selects the one that minimizes a weighted combination of entropy and surprisal:\n$Score(s|C) = \\alpha H(s|C)+(1-\\alpha)Surprisal(s|C)$, where a is a tunable hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between entropy and UID."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "We implement the Entropy-UID optimization algorithm using a pretrained transformer-based lan-"}, {"title": "Results and Analysis", "content": "Our experimental evaluation across three datasets (WikiText-2, OpenWebText, and WMT) reveals several significant findings regarding the effectiveness of different optimization approaches. The Entropy-UID optimization demonstrates consistently superior performance, maintaining the lowest Entropy STD (\u2248 2.8) and stable Average Surprisal (\u2248 5.7) across all datasets. This indicates an optimal balance between prediction uncertainty and accuracy.\nIn contrast, single-objective optimization approaches show distinct limitations. The Entropy-only optimization, while maintaining moderate Entropy STD (\u2248 4.1), results in notably higher Average Surprisal (7.8-7.9), suggesting reduced prediction accuracy. The UID-only approach achieves favorable Average Surprisal (5.4-5.5) but exhibits higher Entropy STD (\u2248 5.7), indicating less stable uncertainty estimates.\nCross-dataset analysis reveals remarkable consistency in these patterns across WikiText-2, OpenWebText, and WMT. The Entropy-UID approach maintains stable performance metrics across different text distributions, demonstrating the robustness of our method. As shown in Figure 1, the absolute differences between Average Entropy and Average Surprisal further confirm these findings, with Entropy-UID achieving the most balanced performance across all datasets.\nThese results strongly suggest that combining entropy and UID optimization provides a more effective approach than single-objective optimization. The consistency across different datasets indicates that our method is robust and generalizable across various text types and distributions. This balanced approach effectively addresses the trade-off between prediction accuracy and stability, offering a promising direction for improving language model decoding strategies."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we presented a novel approach combining entropy and uniform information density (UID) optimization for language model decoding. Our experimental results across three major datasets (WikiText-2, OpenWebText, and WMT) demonstrate that this combined approach consistently outperforms single-objective optimization methods.

This suggests that considering both entropy and information density in the optimization process leads to more robust and reliable text generation. The consistency of these results across different datasets further validates the generalizability of our approach.\nFuture work could explore the adaptation of our method to different model architectures and the investigation of dynamic weighting strategies for balancing entropy and UID objectives.

Moreover, the computational cost of entropy-based optimizations for such models may pose challenges in real-world applications, particularly in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings.\nWhile our metrics focus on optimizing entropy and surprisal, these quantitative measures may not fully align with human judgments of text quality, such as coherence or fluency. Additional human evaluation is required to bridge this gap. Future work should explore solutions to these challenges to enhance the robustness and applicability of our method."}]}

{"title": "EXTRACTING MEMORIZED TRAINING DATA VIA DECOMPOSITION", "authors": ["Ellen Su", "Anu Vellore", "Amy Chang", "Raffaele Mura", "Blaine Nelson", "Paul Kassianik", "Amin Karbasi"], "abstract": "The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The widespread adoption and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses increasing risk to information security and data privacy [Yao et al., 2024]. LLMs are trained on massive text corpora to learn the intricacies of human language and knowledge [Zhao et al., 2023]. While this allows LLMs to serve as helpful assistants and answer user questions across a range of settings, previous work demonstrated that users also have the capability of reconstructing training data from the models through careful prompting [Carlini et al., 2020, 2022, Nasr et al., 2023]. The susceptibility of LLMs to disclose training data exposes security, legal, and ethical risk, and has wide-ranging implications for stakeholders, model developers, and LLM end-users.\nFoundation models are uniquely posed to have unmatched access to massive corpora (e.g., Gao et al. [2020]) as well as the architectural capacity to retain many fine-grained details of their training data. Moreover, LLMs are generative in nature and are trained to produce language and texts like those they train on. Thus, as a natural side-effect of their training objective, LLMs may memorize and reproduce verbatim training examples, opening the door for malicious actors to extract this data and gain access to private, confidential, or sensitive information [Carlini et al., 2020].\nWhile prior training data exfiltration methods use adversarial means to bypass LLM safeguards, we sought to investigate how effectively benign prompts can elicit training data from LLMs. Borrowing inspiration from prior work that identified compositional learning as a machine learning (ML) weakness [Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988, Zhou et al., 2024, Liu et al., 2024], we define an instruction decomposition method which queries the models for training data"}, {"title": "1.1 Ethics and responsible disclosure statement", "content": "It is our priority that this work is shared responsibly with the involved parties to minimize the harm of research-based security risks. Therefore we took appropriate precautions to disclose our research to all parties potentially affected by our work. We have notified both the frontier model providers as well as the data copyright holders of our work."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Training state-of-the-art LLMs requires trillions of tokens of textual information throughout the stages of pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment [Bai et al., 2022]. Deep learning model architectures have been shown to memorize their training data [Carlini et al., 2023]. Researchers have conducted extensive prior work to explore the extent of data memorization in LLMs, both quantitatively assessing its bounds Carlini et al. [2023], Kim et al. [2023] and qualitatively exploring its applications Ziegler [2021].\nAlthough model developers release models for interaction with the general public, training data is generally considered private. Membership inference attacks, in which an actor attempts to determine if a given source was used to train the model [Carlini et al., 2022, Shokri et al., 2017, Choquette-Choo et al., 2021, Fu et al., 2023, Mireshghallah et al., 2022], or training data extraction attacks, in which an actor forces a model to reconstruct the training data text [Carlini et al., 2020, 2018, Balle et al., 2022, Nasr et al., 2023], are then possible privacy and security violations. These approaches pose a problem to both the owners of the training data, who may not want their data reconstructed by LLMs, and to the developers of closed-source models, who may not want to reveal the details of their model training process. In prior work, Carlini et al. [2022] established training data memorization and extraction attacks, showing that low perplexity"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Our method iteratively prompts a LLMs for parts of a targeted source text in an attempt to incrementally reconstruct training data from the model."}, {"title": "3.1 Models", "content": "We perform our experiments on two commercially available Frontier LLMs labeled LLM-\u03b1 and LLM-\u03b2. We treat both as closed-source models and query them using their respective API endpoints."}, {"title": "3.2 Datasets", "content": "We compile two distinct datasets of articles sourced from the New York Times (NYT) and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Each dataset includes article metadata and the full text content of the articles. The metadata consists of attributes such as publication date, authors, and type of material, while the raw text represents the full narrative of each article.\nThe first dataset consists of 3723 articles from NYT, published between 2015 and 2023. The articles are limited to the World, U.S., Opinion, and New York sections and include both news and opinion pieces.\nThe second dataset consists of 1349 WSJ articles. All articles were published between 2017 and 2023 and are limited to news or opinion pieces.\nIn order to establish a baseline against unknown data, we also collect articles beyond the model cutoff dates. For LLM-x the model cutoff data was October 2023, and for LLM-\u1e9e November 2023. We collect in total 900 articles from NYT and 425 articles for WSJ, all published in 2024."}, {"title": "3.3 Instructional decomposition technique", "content": "For each source text in our dataset, we use an LLM to generate a short, identifying summary.

An example of this process is shown in Figure 2."}, {"title": "3.3.1 In-Context learning (ICL) extension", "content": "We develop a set of improvements to the base system prompts, designed to teach the model to perform the task at hand. The first of these improvements are techniques that employ in-context learning (ICL) Brown et al. [2020]. By adding examples within the system prompt of how the LLM is meant to respond to our queries for seed articles, we use ICL to encourage the LLM to regurgitate its memorized training data. We use three different ICL techniques (ICL, ICL-v2, and ICL-v3) to develop system prompts as described in full in Section 3.5."}, {"title": "3.3.2 Multi-Turn prompting extension", "content": "We also extend our simple technique by using Multi-Turn prompting to extract training data. We use multi-turn chat API capabilities to fill in model responses to queries about the first n 1 sentences and ask the target model to generate the nth sentence. First, we ask the model to regurgitate the article title, just like in all of our other experiments. Then, we insert a conversation-like prompt where the assistant responds correctly to queries about the first n 1 sentences. We then ask the model for the nth sentence. An example query is provided in Appendix A.6."}, {"title": "3.4 Metrics", "content": "We use several metrics to capture the success of our extraction methods. Previous studies used perplexity-based metrics before manually verifying a sample's inclusion in the training set [Carlini et al., 2020] or metrics that consider extraction successful if a minimum number of sequential tokens appears in training data [Nasr et al., 2023, Carlini et al., 2023]. However, both of these approaches are not suitable for our methods because we do not have ground truth membership access, and we aim to extract short sequences which, when composed, reveal larger sections of data.\nWe therefore report the following four metrics: Token Range Metric (TRM), Exact Match Positional Metric (EMP), and two BITAP-based metrics, described below. For all our metrics, we only compute them on qualified sentences that are at least eight words long to ensure that our analyses only incorporate sentences with substantial content. We also disqualify boilerplate sentences (i.e., common formulaic sentences that are unrelated to the article's content; see Appendix E) from our metrics."}, {"title": "Token Range Metric (TRM)", "content": "To compute this metric, we quantify the length of the overlapping sequences present in both the model generation and source text by considering non-overlapping regions. We first word-tokenize each qualified sentence with the NLTK library [Bird et al., 2009]. Based on this metric, we compute the Token Range Metric, which represents the cumulative count of words within these validated ranges. The Token Range Metric Score represents the ratio of the sum of words in retrieved word sequences to total words in the examined text."}, {"title": "Exact Match Positional (EMP) Metric", "content": "This metric assesses the accuracy of LLM responses by identifying qualified sentences that are exact matches with those in a target source text, at the exact position that they are located at in the article. We calculate the EMP score as the ratio of correctly matched qualified sentences to the total number of qualified sentences considered in the source text. This score provides a strict and direct measure of how many sentences generated by the model precisely replicate those in the text."}, {"title": "BITAP-Based Match (BITAP) Metric", "content": "The BITAP algorithm [Baeza-Yates, 1989] computes inexact string matching of a pattern within a target sequence allowing for up to K errors (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) within a match [Wu and Manber, 1992]. Using BITAP, we matched texts word-wise (i.e., treating each NLTK-parsed word as a single token within a sentence) to determine whether a qualified sentence from the source text inexactly matches the target LLM's response. Rather than specify K directly, we parameterized our inexact matching by a parameter p \u2208 [0, 1], the maximum percentage of errors. We compute the corresponding Kp for each qualified sentence depending on its length. We fix p to be 0.1 in this work, and report the fraction of qualified sentences that are BITAP-matches.\nThe BITAP metric is useful for measuring near-hit matches. As models may struggle with hallucinations, we propose BITAP as a better metric to estimate the likelihood of a model regurgitating training data while accounting for minor variations. We report both positional and non-positional BITAP scores. For the positional score, we consider whether the model's response inexactly matches the qualified target sentence si for p = 0.1. For the non-positional score, we compute the similarity of the generated text to all qualified sentences after the prompt sentence si\u22121 and report the maximum."}, {"title": "3.5 System prompt", "content": "We design a set of system prompts with progressive levels of sophistication to use for each of the round of filtering described in Section 4.\nIn the first round, we use the SIMPLE prompt strategy. This prompt is designed to be a direct instruction to the model to generate text from the queried articles. The prompt explicitly states rules that the model needs to follow all of which are within the model's alignment. We present an example of a SIMPLE system prompt for LLM-a in Figure 3 with the rest of the system prompts being presented in full in Appendix A.\nIn the second round, in addition to SIMPLE prompt strategy, we use the ICL A.3, ICL-v2 A.4, and ICL-v3 A.5 system prompts. ICL uses in-context-learning Brown et al. [2020] to prompt the model to perform better at the given task. We use artificial examples to demonstrate how to retrieve sentences that immediately follow the given sentences. ICL-v2 and ICL-v3 build upon ICL by implementing techniques that hope to improve model understanding of the task.\nIn the final round, we use the very basic \"You are a helpful assistant.\" as the system prompt. We assume that the Multi-Turn queries already convey a lot of information about the underlying task."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "We perform three rounds of experiments. In each consecutive round, we apply increasingly expensive methods to isolate the articles that are likely to be in the training set of each model. After each round, we select a subset of the best-performing articles using the non-positional BITAP metric to study in more depth. In the first round, we evaluate our methods on all articles in the dataset. In the second round, we evaluate our methods on a smaller subset of articles selected according to their first round performance on the BITAP metric. In the third and final round, we select a small subset of articles from which we are able to consistently extract data. For this final round, we apply our most intensive Multi-Turn method A.6 to extract as many sentences from the articles as possible.\nFor each round we report the TRM, EMP, BITAP-positional, and BITAP-non-positional metrics. We report the number of articles with non-zero metrics and report the mean score of each metric."}, {"title": "4.1 First Round", "content": "In the first round, we perform a full sweep of our extraction process on all of the NYT and WSJ articles that we collected (3723 and 1349 articles respectively). We sample the first 10 sentences in each article 3 times with temperature = 0 and top_p = 0.9. We use the basic system prompts (Appendices A.1 and A.2).\nWe also run the procedure against 900 NYT and 425 WSJ articles that were published after the cutoff dates for both models. Since these articles did not exist at the time of training, the models should not be able to accurately reproduce them. We thus include this post-cutoff baseline to validate that our metrics are accurate measures of the regurgitation capacity of target models. The results are reported in Table 1 for NYT articles in Table 2 for WSJ articles."}, {"title": "4.2 Second Round", "content": "In the second round of experiments, we select articles from the first round for which the average non-positional BITAP score is greater than 0. This process yields a subset of 854 articles from the NYT dataset on LLM-x and 100 articles on LLM-\u1e9e. For WSJ, the procedure yields 203 and 26 articles for LLM-x and LLM-\u1e9e respectively. We repeat our experiments on these rows with the more advanced prompting techniques described in Section 3.3.1. We fix the temperature and top_p parameters, but we run each article for only a single iteration. Results for the second round are shown in Table 3 for NYT articles in Table 4 for WSJ articles.\nDespite yielding BITAP near-hits in the first round, many articles fail to yield the same results in the second round. On some articles, the models refuse to provide answers to the prompts, and we exclude such articles from the count."}, {"title": "4.3 Details of Selection for the Final Round", "content": "To assess whether different prompts regurgitate the same articles, we conduct an additional analysis based on the results presented in Table 3. Specifically, we examine whether the articles with a non-positional BITAP greater than 0 are consistent across the different prompts of our methods.\nThe analysis reveals there is no complete overlap among these articles. The union of all articles, considering the non-positional BITAP metric, results in a total of 147 articles for LLM-\u03b1. Of these, 34 are regurgitated exclusively with the SIMPLE prompt method, while 37 are regurgitated solely with one of the three ICL prompt methods. There is generally some overlap among the articles regurgitated with the ICL prompt methods. Out of the 147 total articles, 5 are regurgitated solely with the ICL prompt, 5 with ICL-v2, and 5 with ICL-v3.\nSimilarly, LLM-\u1e9e regurgitated at least one sentence on a total of 32 articles with non-positional BITAP greater than 0. Of these, 8 articles are regurgitated exclusively with the SIMPLE prompt method, and 11 are regurgitated with one of the ICL prompt methods. As with LLM-a, the ICL prompt methods exhibit some overlap among the 32 regurgitated articles: 4 are regurgitated solely with the ICL prompt, 3 with ICL-v2, and none with ICL-v3."}, {"title": "4.4 Final Round", "content": "Many articles that were previously selected did not yield any BITAP near-hit matches after the second attempt. Other articles yielded near-hits under different methods. We select the union of all articles that yield at least one near-hit sentence under at least one method in the second round for our final examination. This selection procedure yields 146 and 32 NYT articles for LLM-\u03b1 and LLM-\u03b2, respectively. On WSJ, the procedure yields 25 and 10 articles for LLM-\u03b1 and LLM-\u1e9e, respectively. More details can be found in Section 4.3.\nFor the final round of data extraction, we modify our hyperparameters to try to sample high-likelihood tokens from the model. We set the temperature to 1e-6. 1 We also use a more advanced Multi-Turn prompt (shown in Appendix A.6) to sample sentences from the model. We replace our prior custom system prompts with a standard \"You are a helpful assistant\" prompt. These modifications steer the model towards sampling high-likelihood tokens to maximize the model's potential to regurgitate trained information. Finally, in this round, we evaluate our technique on all sentences in every article rather than just their first 10 sentences."}, {"title": "4.5 Examination of Retrieved Articles", "content": "The final round suggests that on a number of articles the model can regurgitate large portions of the article. We examine the retrieved articles from the final round in more detail."}, {"title": "4.6 Additional Experiments", "content": "Some of the sentences we extract using our method are quotations. These quotations are often publicly available information that may be related to the article's topic rather than being unique to the article. To assess the impact of quotations on our results, we designed an additional experiment on NYT to determine how frequently the model outputs a specific quotation without article-specific information.\nIn this experiment, we prompt the corresponding model to generate an article simply based on the summary of the article in the style of the corpus. The summary does not contain any information about either the author, title, or year of the article's publication. Our hypothesis is that if the generated quote is from a public figure, the model may generate that quote whether or not it trained on the article.\nFor each of the articles in the final round, we use the prompt in Appendix B to generate a new article in the same style as the original. We then compare the quotes from the ground truth article and the generated article. Out of 146 and 32 articles in the final round, 45 and 13 articles had quotes that the models LLM-x and LLM-\u1e9e could generate from the summary alone, respectively. In Figure 5, we compare the BITAP-positional (no quotes) scores of the articles, with red dots being articles that contained generic quotes not associated directly with the article. None of the high-match articles (above 20% score) have generic quotes. Many articles that do have generic quotes also contain non-quote sentences (red dots that are above 0).\nFrom this experiment, we hypothesize that, for high-matching articles, the model does condition on the article to generate the correct sentences rather than generic topics and phrases related to the article's topic."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "If this methodology proves replicable at scale, the implications are widespread, require careful consideration from development to end-use, and raise many questions. How can model developers craft LLMs that are able to discern the intent of a line of questioning if the ultimate intent is not revealed in the prompt? How can organizations that utilize LLMs ensure that no malicious actor can extract sensitive, proprietary, or non-public information from the dataset? We hope that continued research in this area will provide more insight into non-adversarial training data"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "As the field of machine learning matures, we expect new language models to become increasingly complex. We also expect adversaries and actors with malicious intents to adapt their strategies and approaches to leverage LLMs for malicious purposes and exploit their weaknesses. This paper reveals one particular method that may be used to extract training data from frontier LLMs, using innocuous and successive prompting that does not alert the LLM to restrict its outputs. This research highlights that diligent governance of language models and private, non-public, or sensitive data is necessary, and that more effort and resources are needed to develop methods that protect language models from decomposition attacks. Researchers, developers, and practitioners should strive to understand the data and security risks associated with LLMs in their current state, and to balance the utility of LLMs as beneficial tools for productivity and learning against any actions that serve malicious ends. In the short term, implementing safety guardrails atop current LLMs in every application can protect against data extraction attacks. The direction that this governance takes will define the field of AI security and inform the way we interact with LLMs in the future."}, {"title": "A System Prompts", "content": ""}, {"title": "A.1 Discoverable System Prompt - LLM-\u03b1", "content": "You are <Name of LLM-x>, a large language model trained by <Vendor-a>, based on the <LLM-x> architecture.

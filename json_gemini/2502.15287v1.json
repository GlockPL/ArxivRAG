{"title": "Time Warp: The Gap Between Developers' Ideal vs Actual Workweeks in an AI-Driven Era", "authors": ["Sukrit Kumar", "Drishti Goel", "Thomas Zimmermann", "Brian Houck", "B. Ashok", "Chetan Bansal"], "abstract": "Software developers balance a variety of different tasks in a workweek, yet the allocation of time often differs from what they consider ideal. Identifying and addressing these deviations is crucial for organizations aiming to enhance the productivity and well-being of the developers. In this paper, we present the findings from a survey of 484 software developers at Microsoft, which aims to identify the key differences between how developers would like to allocate their time during an ideal workweek versus their actual workweek. Our analysis reveals significant deviations between a developer's ideal workweek and their actual workweek, with a clear correlation: as the gap between these two workweeks widens, we observe a decline in both productivity and satisfaction. By examining these deviations in specific activities, we assess their direct impact on the developers' satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, given the growing adoption of AI tools in software engineering, both in the industry and academia, we identify specific tasks and areas that could be strong candidates for automation. In this paper, we make three key contributions: 1) We quantify the impact of workweek deviations on developer productivity and satisfaction 2) We identify individual tasks that disproportionately affect satisfaction and productivity 3) We provide actual data-driven insights to guide future AI automation efforts in software engineering, aligning them with the developers' requirements and ideal workflows for maximizing their productivity and satisfaction.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In software engineering, the productivity and satisfaction of developers are pivotal factors that influence both individual performance, customer experience and ultimately, organiza- tional success [1], [2]. The day-to-day activities which define a developer's workweek encompass a broad spectrum of tasks; from coding and designing new systems, to preparing documents, attending meetings, on-boarding new employees, adhering to security and compliance tasks, etc [3]. Each of these tasks is integral to the software development life cycle. Ideally, developers would prefer to allocate their time across these tasks in a way that optimizes both productivity and satisfaction- this can be referred to as their 'ideal work- week'. However, in practice, their 'actual workweek', can vary significantly from their 'ideal' due to fluctuating workloads, shifting organizational priorities, dependencies on other teams, technical challenges, the influence of the work environment, etc [4], [5], [6]. This misalignment between the ideal and actual workweek raises several intriguing research questions. Key among them is how these deviations impact developers' productivity and satisfaction. By examining these deviations, we can uncover patterns that may not only reveal the activities where devel- opers struggle the most but also where they feel most pro- ductive and satisfied. Understanding these dynamics provides actionable insights for engineers, managers and organizations to create more effective work environments. Furthermore, gaining deeper insights into the relationship between time allocation across activities, productivity, and satisfaction could inform the development of future and current AI-driven automation tools. With the growing role of AI in software engineering, understanding which tasks developers are most eager to automate becomes crucial. For instance, certain tasks may seem to offer high productivity but are inher- ently dissatisfying for developers to engage with. Identifying these tasks can help guide future research and development of these tools to be better aligned with real-world needs of the developers, allowing them to focus on more satisfying work. In this paper, we present the findings from our study aimed at analyzing the differences between a developer's 'ideal' and 'actual' workweek. Our study builds upon existing research in this field, particularly those exploring developers' typical and optimal workdays [3]. By analyzing deviations at the weekly level, we capture the cumulative effects of task allocation, while providing a more fine-grained understanding of how var- ious activities impact productivity and satisfaction. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first work that focuses on how deviations, both at the overall workweek and individual activity levels, affect developers' productivity and satisfaction. Our research additionally quantifies how deviations across different activities impact self-reported developer productivity and satisfaction. We also explore how AI tool usage influences the productivity and satisfaction of developers. In addition to that, we systematically analyze and present the developers' feedback on which tasks they would prefer to see automated using AI, providing valuable insights for future AI tool devel- opment. An outline of the key research questions driving this study are as follows: RQ1: How do developers allocate their time during a typical workweek, and how does this compare to their perception of an ideal workweek?"}, {"title": "II. METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this section, we provide a detailed description of the methodology used to design and conduct the survey. We then discuss potential limitations of our study.\nA. Survey Design\nTo gain insights into the types of activities developers en- gage in during a typical workweek, we first conducted a series of exploratory interviews with 12 randomly selected partici- pants. These semi-structured exploratory interviews provided a qualitative foundation, allowing us to iteratively develop a comprehensive list of high-level activities that reflect what a developer does over the course of a workweek. The findings from these interviews were instrumental in refining our survey design. The survey was distributed to software engineers working in Microsoft teams across India and the United States between June to July 2024. A total of 6000 randomly selected indi- vidual contributor (IC) developers were invited to participate in the survey via email across multiple batches. We also sent follow-ups to people who had started the survey but had not finished it and also to those who hadn't started it. We framed it as a study aimed at boosting developer productivity by helping us understand how they allocate their time in a workweek. The survey received 484 complete responses (a response rate of 8.06%). In the invite, the participants were also informed that they could enter a sweepstake to win one out of ten $50 Amazon.com Gift Cards after finishing the survey. The ethics for this survey were reviewed and approved by the Microsoft Research Institutional Review Board (MSR-IRB), which is an IRB federally registered with the United States Department of Health & Human Services. From the exploratory interviews, we identified sixteen key high-level activities, which were subsequently used to quantify the developers' time allocation in the survey. We designed the survey questions to broadly cover the main research questions that we had in mind and also included additional questions which we thought could offer interesting new insights. A brief summary of the questions is given below:\n\u2022 Their current role and years of experience in the industry and team\n\u2022 The number of hours spent on various activities in the previous workweek\n\u2022 The percentage of time they would want to allocate to each activity in an ideal workweek\n\u2022 How productive and satisfied they felt in the past work- week\n\u2022 Activities they found to be most cognitively challenging\n\u2022 How often do they use AI tools to assist them in various activities\n\u2022 Two open-ended questions about the tasks they would want to automate using AI tools, and advice for new hires to boost their productivity and satisfaction levels\nB. Limitations\nThis study presents an exploratory survey, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to introduce the concept of a developer's perceived ideal workweek and assess how deviations from it impact productivity and satisfac- tion. Additionally, it explores the specific activities developers would prefer to automate using AI tools. While this research provides valuable insights, the following limitations should be addressed by future studies. External Validity: Since the study was conducted within a single company, the results may not be generalizable to organizations of different sizes, structures, or roles. Additionally, the low response rate and the survey's confinement to specific teams further limit the generalizability of the findings to developers in other contexts. Construct Validity: The survey relies on the developers to accurately self-report the time they spend on the key"}, {"title": "III. COMPARING DEVELOPER'S ACTUAL VS. IDEAL WORKWEEK", "content": "To answer RQ1, we asked the developers to specify the number of hours that they spend on key activities during a typical workweek, as well as the percentage of time they would ideally allocate to these activities. We transform the actual workweek responses into the percentage scale by dividing the time spent on each activity by the total number of hours in the response. We present the developers' actual and ideal workweek responses in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) respectively, and also highlight the key differences in the percentage of time spent between them in Fig. 2.\nA. The Actual Week: How Developers Spend Their Time\nIn the actual workweek, as depicted in Fig. 1(a), there is a considerable variation in the time developers spend across activities, specifically for 'Coding', 'Architecting & designing new systems', 'Security & Compliance', 'Debugging', and 'Communication & Meetings', with wide inter-quartile ranges and the presence of many outliers. This could be attributed to the differences in the type of project, team structure, level of experience, or individual roles. Furthermore, developers dedicate the majority of their time on 'Communication & Meetings' (\u224812%), 'Coding' (\u224811%), 'Debugging' (\u22489%), 'Architecting and designing new systems' (\u22486%), and 'Pull Requests/Code Reviews' (\u22485%). Conversely, they spend the least time on 'Learning New Technologies', 'Mentoring and Onboarding', 'Giving Technical Presentations', and 'Setting- up Monitoring and Dashboards'.\nB. The Ideal Week: How Developers Want to Spend Their Time\nIn contrast to the actual workweek, the ideal workweek shows a less varied distribution across most activities, as seen in Fig. 1(b). Developers prefer to allocate their time primarily to 'coding' (\u2248 20%) and \u2018Architecting & designing new systems' (\u2248 15%), while maintaining a more balanced distribution across the remaining activities. This desire for balance is echoed by individual developers in their personal experiences. For instance, developer D223 offers this advice to new employees: \"Maintain a good balance of all the activities needed to prevent burn out, and start with the activities that you find interesting.\"\nThe most striking differences are observed in 'Commu- nication & Meetings' and 'Task Creation & Management', where developers show a strong preference for reducing the time spent. These activities are marked by high variability in the actual workweek, but are more contained in the ideal scenario, reflecting a widespread desire to minimize the time spent on these activities. Developer D342 emphasizes this sentiment: \"Optimize for operations. Automate EVERYTHING for Continuous Delivery. The word 'manual' should not be in your vocabulary unless referring to something to read. This way, you will have more time to focus on the creative process that is software engineering and be able to release often and with confidence.\". Similarly, D238 adds, \u201cMore focus time and fewer meetings.\"\nIn Fig. 2 we highlight several areas where there is a signif-"}, {"title": "IV. IMPACT OF DEVIATIONS FROM THE IDEAL WORKWEEK ON DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY & SATISFACTION", "content": "In this section, we address RQ2 by evaluating how devia- tions from a developer's self-perceived ideal workweek influ- ence their levels of satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, we identify the specific activity-level deviations and how they contribute to the observed effects.\nA. Bridging the Gap: How Deviations from the Ideal Work- week affect Developers' Productivity and Satisfaction\nIn the survey, we asked the developers to rate their previous week on five different levels of productivity ('Very productive', 'Productive', 'Neither productive nor unproductive', 'Unpro- ductive', and 'Very unproductive') and satisfaction ('Very satisfied', 'Satisfied', 'Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied', 'Dis- satisfied', and 'Very Dissatisfied'). We split the developers based on each of these different categories and calculate and plot the Spearman rank correlation coefficient [8], and mean absolute error [9] between the actual and ideal workweek, which are defined by the time they spend on the 16 key activities and the time they would ideally allocate to each activity."}, {"title": "B. Impact of activity-level deviations on productivity & satis- faction", "content": "In the previous section, we highlighted the impact of devi- ation from a developer's ideal workweek on their productivity and satisfaction levels. To gain a more detailed understanding of these deviations, we calculate the differences between the time spent on these activities in the actual and ideal workweek (Actual Ideal). Each variable in the Table II and Table III is the difference between the actual and ideal workweek for that particular activity. Positive difference values imply more time being spent on the activity than desired (over-allocation), while negative values imply less time being spent than desired (under-allocation). We apply an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to identify specific activities that significantly influence developers' productivity and satisfaction. OLS was chosen for its ability to model linear relationships for contin- uous variables. Since the primary goal is to assess how incre- mental changes in activity allocation impact productivity and satisfaction, OLS provides a straightforward, and interpretable framework for the same."}, {"title": "C. Mapping Activity Time Across Productivity-Satisfaction Profiles: A Path Toward Smart Automation", "content": "In Fig. 5, we categorize developers into three distinct groups: 'High Productivity, High Satisfaction,' 'High Produc- tivity, Low Satisfaction,' and 'Low Productivity, Low Satisfac- tion,' based on their self-reported productivity and satisfaction levels from the previous workweek (as detailed in IV-A). For the sake of simplicity, we merged the 'Very Productive' and 'Productive' groups into a single \u2018High Productivity' category, and similarly for other categories. The 'Low Productivity, High Satisfaction' group was excluded due to its small sample size of two developers. For each remaining group, we visualize the average hours spent on the 16 key activities, highlighting pat- terns in how time allocation varies across different productivity and satisfaction combinations."}, {"title": "V. IMPACT OF AI TOOL USAGE ON DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY AND SATISFACTION", "content": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its growing adoption across industries, particularly in automating development tasks, brings forth a crucial question: Which tasks should be automated using AI to maximize both productivity and satisfaction? In this section, we observe how the fre- quency of AI tool usage impacts the developers' productivity and satisfaction and analyze the responses gathered from developers, examining which tasks they believe are most suited for automation.\nA. How does the Frequency of AI Tool Usage Influence Productivity & Satisfaction\nIn the survey, we asked the developers to indicate how frequently they incorporate AI tools during their workweek, ('Daily', 'Weekly', \u2018Monthly', 'Once every 6 months', or 'Once every year'). We again collapse the top 2 and bottom 2 categories for both productivity and satisfaction into a single category (Productive/Unproductive).\nFig. 6 reveals that developers who use AI tools daily report the highest levels of productivity, with 83.7% reporting to be \"productive\" However, as the frequency of AI tool usage decreases (e.g., from weekly to annually), the proportion of productive developers also declines, while the percentage of those reporting neutrality or even negative productivity outcomes increases.\nFig. 7 shows a similar trend between AI tool usage and satisfaction levels. Developers who utilize AI tools on a daily basis experience the highest levels of satisfaction (74.5%), with most of them reporting to be \"satisfied.\" Again, as AI usage frequency decreases, dissatisfaction becomes more prevalent.\nB. Which tasks do developers want to automate?\nIn the survey, we asked the developers to answer the question \"Which of your current tasks would you most like to see automated? Which processes do you think could be enhanced to minimize repetitive work?\"\nWe received 242 open-ended responses from the develop- ers. To analyze the responses, we utilized the GPT-4 model to identify an initial set of task categories highlighted in"}, {"title": "VI. DISCUSSION", "content": "Our study provides valuable insight into the complex dy- namics of a software developers' workweek. We aim to un- derstand how the deviations from ideal and actual workweeks impact productivity and satisfaction levels. Additionally, we explored the role of up and coming AI tools and how we can modify our approach towards building new tools to build more tools that developers want. In this sections we will discuss a short summary of our findings and discuss the implications of our findings and impact on developers, managers and organizations in the software development industry as a whole.\nA. Time allotment vs productivity/satisfaction\nOur results show most developers generally have very different workweeks from their ideal ones. This deviation has a measurable impact on both productivity and satisfaction levels. We quantitatively showed that as the gap between the actual and ideal workweek increases there is a substantial negative impact on both productivity and satisfaction levels. This finding highlights the importance of having a better balance between what a developer wants to do and what they typically do in practice.\nUnsurprisingly, activities that positively influence both pro- ductivity and satisfaction are those typically considered core development tasks, such as coding, documentation, and code refactoring. Conversely, time spent on maintaining and creat- ing development environments, dealing with security and com- pliance issues, and excessive communication negatively im- pacts both metrics. These activity-level insights offer broader suggestions for how organizations can optimize their work- flows to maximize time on core development activities while minimizing time on less preferred tasks.\nThese findings present several opportunities for software developers, teams, organizations and researchers working in this field. Organizations can potentially redesign or optimize existing workflows to better align with the needs of developers. There may also be opportunities to adjust team structures to distribute tasks more effectively, allowing developers to focus more on their preferred activities. Additionally, introducing new tools or improving existing ones could help streamline less desirable tasks, freeing up more time for core development activities.\nA potential interesting direction for future research would be to explore the long-term impact of better aligning developers' workweeks with their ideal ones. This could involve examining changes in code quality, project success metrics, and overall user experience over time. However, it's important to note that finding the right balance will likely require ongoing assessment and adjustment, as the ideal workweek may vary not only between individuals but also evolve over time for each developer.\nB. Future impact of AI tools\nWe observed a strong relation between how frequently developers used AI tools and their reported satisfaction and productivity levels. Developers who use these tools daily tended to report the highest level of both satisfaction and productivity. This underscores the importance of these tools in the modern software development landscape.\nAs discussed earlier, developers most want to see activities automated, which we observed to correlate with lower satis- faction and higher productivity levels. These findings present a new exciting direction for future AI tools and automation development efforts. By focusing the development of AI tools on areas which can have the dual benefit of boosting developer productivity and satisfaction whilst at the same time allowing them to focus on tasks they enjoy and find more fulfilling, organizations can foster a more motivated and effective workforce.\nCurrently a large number of AI tools focus specifically on helping developers write code [10]-[12]. However, our findings suggest a strong desire for automation in non-coding related tasks such as documentation, task management, secu- rity and compliance, and communication. This reveals a gap in the current AI tool landscape and presents a significant opportunity for innovation. Developing new AI tools that address these areas could offer substantial benefits not only to individual developers but also to organizations as a whole. The potential impact of such targeted AI tool development is far-reaching. By automating tasks that developers find less productive or satisfying, we could see a shift in how developers allocate their time, potentially bringing their actual workweeks more in line with their ideal ones. This could lead to higher job satisfaction, increased productivity, and potentially even im- provements in code quality and project outcomes as developers are able to focus more on core development tasks they find most engaging. However, as the adoption of these tools grow, there might be a change in what a developer considers to be"}, {"title": "VII.

Developer activities and time allotment", "content": "Understanding how developers spend their time across various activities has been a very well explored topic. Prior work analyzed how developers spend their time within the IDE by specifically tracking IDE usage, monitoring test and other refactoring feature usage [13], [14]. This work did not focus on other activities outside the IDE like collaboration, communication and planning.\nMore recent works have captured a more holistic picture of what a developer does and aimed to capture the time spent through various methods of capturing data like surveys [3], [15], [16], observations and interviews [17], and through tracking usage of the computer [13], [14]. While many studies focus on understanding the daily activities, fewer have looked at patterns across an entire workweek. Our study builds on this gap, extending our window to the past work week allowing us to get a more comprehensive understanding of how a developer spends their time and also reducing the impact of day to day variations. In addition, we compare the actual workweek with an ideal workweek."}, {"title": "B.

CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we provide valuable insights on the complex relationship between software developers' workweek and how it's deviation from their ideal workweek affects their produc- tivity and satisfaction levels. Here are our key findings:\n1) There is a large deviation between the ideal and actual workweeks, with developers clearly wanting to spend more time on core developmental activities and less on communication/maintenance ones.\n2) As the deviation between the ideal and actual workweek increases the productivity and satisfaction levels tend to fall.\n3) Usage of AI tools by a software developer is positively correlated with higher levels of productivity and satis- faction. This effect is especially more pronounced when the frequency of usage increases.\n4) Developers have strong preferences towards automation on activities like documentation, environment setup, testing, monitoring etc. These insights will inform the research and development of future AI tools.\nThe insights we present in this paper have important impli- cations for developers, managers and companies as a whole. Teams and companies can potentially boost satisfaction and productivity levels by working on more closely aligning a typical workweek with a developer's ideal workweek. Fur- thermore, the development of future AI tools can take into account the needs of a developer as discussed in our paper and fill gaps in this area.\nWhile our work is restricted to Microsoft, it would be interesting to see how our research fits into different organiza- tional contexts and over longer intervals of time. Additionally, another interesting aspect to look at would be how AI-tools potentially change a typical and ideal workweek of a developer as the adoption and scope of AI increases.\nIn conclusion, we try to understand how time spent on different activities over a workweek and the deviation from a developers \u201cideal\u201d workweek impact productivity and satisfac- tion levels. Our findings reveal significant potential to reshape, innovate, and streamline workflows, enhancing developer pro- ductivity and satisfaction. This will lead to more fulfilling work experiences and higher quality outcomes, benefiting both developers and the organizations."}]}

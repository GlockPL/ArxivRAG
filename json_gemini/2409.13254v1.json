Introductory Background", "content": "Understanding the mechanisms behind mysterious evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) is a central narrative in contemporary biology Okasha (2005); Szathm\u00e1ry (2015). These transitions, which encompass the evolutionary milestones enabling discrete biological entities to coalesce into complex, higher-order wholes, pose profound questions about the origins of collective reproduction and complex life forms. At the heart of understanding ETIs lies the exploration of how new levels of biological organisation emerge and the dynamics by which these levels attain and sustain the capability for collective reproduction Smith and Szathmary (1997).\nETI research examines the complex interplay between individual fitness and collective fitness in emergent groups. Historically, studies have fluctuated between focusing on the reproductive interests of the components (e.g., cells or individuals) and the overall fitness of the whole (e.g., multicellular organisms or social groups) Michod and Nedelcu (2003). This body of work aims to elucidate the conditions under which evolutionary pressures facilitate a \"decoupling,\" where selective pressures on individual components are intricately linked but distinct from those on the collective entity Michod (2000).\nMoreover, traditional approaches have often leaned on theoretical models that, while invaluable, lack the dynamic representation of evolutionary processes and the spontaneous emergence of higher-level individuality Stewart (1997); Heylighen (2000). This fragmentation in ETI research highlights the need for innovative methodologies capable of integrating these complex dynamics into a cohesive understanding. Artificial Life (ALife) simulations emerge as a promising frontier in this context, offering a novel lens through which the spontaneous emergence of collective behaviours and higher-order individuality can be observed and analysed Moreno and Ofria (2019).\nThis paper introduces VitaNova an ALife simulation that investigates the evolution of neuronal agents, or \"boids,\" that form flocks to navigate and thrive in predator environments. This simulation revolves around two processes: self-organization, which is governed by evolving neural networks that dictate boid behaviour, and natural selection, which forces these agents to adapt and survive. This subtle interplay between individual behaviour modulation and group dynamics results in the formation of cohesive groups capable of collective reproduction\u2014a phenomenon that mirrors key aspects of ETIs. VitaNova demonstrates how the combined forces of self-organization and natural selection can drive the spontaneous formation of reproductive groups, providing new insights into the evolution of complex biological organisation.\nThe next section presents results from VitaNova, which show the emergence of ring-structures that intriguingly exhibit the capacity for self-reproduction. We tackle the underlying question of how such complex collective behaviors arise. Through the simulation, we observe boids evolving their neural networks, thereby discovering increasingly adaptive behaviours that enable them to organize into flocks. This flocking behaviour serves as a survival mechanism, allowing them to more effectively evade predators and efficiently access resources. This evolutionary process, driven by natural selection at the individual level, eventually leads to the spontaneous formation of ring structures. These structures not only maintain stability over time but also demonstrate the ability to reproduce, forming new cohesive units. This phenomenon serves as a compelling indication of an ETI, showcasing the transition from individual boids to a higher-level reproductive entity within the simulation.\nFollowing that, we provide a detailed description of the VitaNova model and how it differs from other ALife models having self-replicating patterns. The following sections delve into related work, providing a brief discussion of the vast topic of evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) and situating our findings within this larger context. The paper concludes with an examination of potential future directions, laying out a road map for further research into the mechanisms and phenomena associated with ETIs as observed using the VitaNova simulation framework.

Significantly, the simulation shows a transition from solitary boids to organised flocks, culminating in the formation of ring structures that exhibit both stability and the capacity for division, indicating a potential mechanism for group-level reproduction.\nThe succession of these division events reinforces the concept of emergent collective reproduction within our simulation. The flocks do not merely grow in numbers but undergo a division that hints at a form of reproduction at the collective level. Such behaviour emerges from the underlying rules governing individual boids, without the need for explicit programming of reproductive synchronisation. This cyclical pattern of collective growth and division provides a compelling demonstration of how complex life-like behaviours can spontaneously emerge from simple rules in artificial life systems."}, {"title": "2.2 Group Reproduction in First-Generation Ring Structure", "content": "The development and subsequent reproduction of the first-generation ring structure is an interesting event in our simulation."}, {"title": "2.3 Observational Analysis of Flock Metrics", "content": "The evolution of flock metrics over time offers a compelling narrative of the underlying dynamics governing the VitaNova simulation. Figure 6 presents a dual perspective on the flock count and average flock size, which, when analysed together, indicate a periodicity suggestive of reproductive events.\nAn initial fluctuation in flock count reflects the turbulent phase of flock formation and disbandment as the system seeks stability. As the simulation progresses, we observe a period where a single flock dominates, aligning with a steady increase in average flock size (steps 2000 to 3200). This growth, uninterrupted by the formation of new flocks, suggests an accumulative phase where the collective structure fortifies, potentially gearing up for a reproductive division."}, {"title": "2.4 Role Distribution and Collective Adaptations", "content": "This section delves into the adaptive dynamics of Flock 0 and its first-generation offspring, Flock 1, highlighting their distinct strategies in response to predator pressures and internal growth demands.\nFigure 7 illustrates Flock O's strategic equilibrium between energy distribution and flock size. Despite individual energy variances, a consistent average suggests a pre-reproductive balance. Interestingly, the soldier/worker ratio inversely correlates with flock size, indicating a tactical shift from defence to expansion in anticipation of reproduction (Figure 1). This shift underscores Flock O's emergent strategy to balance survival and growth in a predator-dense environment.\nContrastingly, Flock 1 (Figure 8) showcases a proportional growth-defence strategy, diverging from its predecessor. Notably, Flock 1's adaptation in a less predator-threatened environment optimises its resource allocation towards balanced growth, maintaining a steady soldier/worker ratio. This adaptation indicates a sophisticated response, leveraging environmental conditions to strategise expansion while ensuring defence readiness.\nThe differential response to predator presence between Flock 0 and Flock 1 underscores the capacity of such artificial life systems to exhibit advanced forms of adaptive behaviour. It suggests that collectives within the simulation can not only evolve complex internal dynamics but also react and adapt to the broader environmental context in which they exist. This ability to modify strategies based on environmental pressures further affirms the potential of simulations like VitaNova to explore the intricate dynamics of life and evolution, offering insights into how entities might navigate and adapt to changing ecological landscapes"}, {"title": "3.

This approach departs from Reynolds (1987)'s classical model by utilising neural outputs to modulate core steering behaviours separation, alignment, and cohesion as opposed to fixed rules and constants.\n\nInput Layer: The network's input layer comprises 11 neurons, processing a range of environmental cues such as the relative positions and velocities of nearby boids and predators, alongside the boid's current energy level. This setup allows for a detailed perception of the surrounding environment and the boid's status within it.\nHidden Layer: A singular hidden layer with 10 neurons intermediates the input signals, extracting relevant patterns to inform the boid's behavior.\nOutput Layer: The final layer outputs tendencies for each behavioral aspect:\n\u2022 Predator Avoidance Tendency ($T_{avoid}$): Initiates evasive actions when predators are close, improving survival chances.\n\u2022 Role Tendencies ($T_{worker}$, $T_{soldier}$): Dictate the likelihood of the boid adopting worker or soldier roles in subsequent steps.\nVitaNova leverages neural network-driven behaviour modulation to extend beyond the fixed behaviours of Reynolds' model, achieving a dynamic simulation environment. This allows boid behaviours to adapt in real-time to both environmental stimuli and their internal states.\nThe neural architecture underpinning each boid enables a complex interplay between autonomy and collective behaviour, effectively capturing the nuanced dynamics of natural life forms. Thus, the neural network is crucial in VitaNova, facilitating an exploration of the interplay between individual actions and collective phenomena."}, {"title": "Agent Motion and Steering", "content": "Boid motion within VitaNova is driven by neural network outputs, influencing core steering behaviors-separation, alignment, and cohesion-based on Reynolds' principles Reynolds (1987), with the addition of predator avoidance and role determination:\n$\\Delta(dx) = T_{sep} \\cdot Separation_x + T_{align} \\cdot Alignment_x + T_{coh} \\cdot Cohesion_x + T_{avoid} \\cdot Avoidance_x,$\n$\\Delta(dy) = T_{sep} \\cdot Separation_y + T_{align} \\cdot Alignment_y + T_{coh} \\cdot Cohesion_y + T_{avoid} \\cdot Avoidance_y,$\nwhere $\\Delta(dx)$ and $\\Delta(dy)$ denote adjustments to the boid's velocity in the x and y directions, respectively, and $T_{avoid}$ represents the predator avoidance tendency with $Avoidance_x$ and $Avoidance_y$ as the directional components of evasion.\nVelocity is updated accordingly:\n$dx_{new} = dx + \\Delta(dx),$\n$dy_{new} = dy + \\Delta(dy).$\nRole-switching is determined by the outputs $T_{worker}$ and $T_{soldier}$, with the boid adopting the role with the higher tendency at each simulation step, facilitating dynamic adaptation to the environment and task demands.\nThe predator avoidance mechanism in VitaNova is governed by the neural output $T_{avoid}$, which dynamically modulates each boid's evasion behavior. The intensity of avoidance, determined by $T_{avoid}$, influences whether a boid opts for individual escape or seeks safety in numbers by flocking with others. This behavior is encapsulated by the following equations:\n$(escape\\_dx, escape\\_dy) = escape\\_predator(nearest\\_predator, T_{avoid}),$\nwhere $escape\\_predator(\\cdot)$ computes the evasion vector $(escape\\_dx, escape\\_dy)$ away from the closest predator, scaled by the avoidance intensity $T_{avoid}$. The boid's velocity is then updated as follows to incorporate this evasion vector:\n$dx_{new} = dx + escape\\_dx,$\n$dy_{new} = dy + escape\\_dy.$\nThis critical neural output enables a boid to dynamically decide between an individual strategy to evade predators or to coalesce with other boids, potentially enhancing its survival through collective avoidance. The adaptability and complexity of these evasion tactics underscore the sophisticated interplay between autonomy and collective behavior in the VitaNova simulation, mirroring survival strategies observed in natural systems."}, {"title": "3,2 Predator Behaviour", "content": "In addition to boids, predators are introduced to provide dynamic challenges, influencing boid behaviours and flock evolution. With behaviorus defined by speed, visual range, and a catch radius, predators hunt within the simulation, reversing direction when encountering three or more soldier boids. This adaptive behaviour simulates predator aversion to collective defences, emphasising the soldier role's importance in boid survival strategies. Such predator-boid interactions enrich the ecosystem's complexity, showcasing the evolutionary pressures that shape group behaviours, social structures, and the adaptive role-switching between worker and soldier boids. This dynamic interplay enhances our understanding of natural selection and the development of cooperative strategies within artificial life simulations."}, {"title": "3.3 Evolutionary Dynamics and Emergent Properties", "content": "VitaNova's evolutionary mechanism is based on energy-driven reproduction and neural network mutations. When a boid accumulates sufficient energy, it reproduces, creating an offspring whose neural parameters are mutated versions of its own. This method facilitates behavioural evolution and strategy diversification within the population. Algorithm 11 is the pseudocode for how evolutionary algorithm works in VitaNova. This approach ensures the continuous introduction of genetic variability, allowing the emergence of novel behaviours and enhancing the population's overall adaptability.\nIn VitaNova, fitness emerges implicitly rather than being dictated by an external objective function typical of traditional evolutionary algorithms for problem-solving Fogel (1994); Mitchell (1998). Unlike these models, where behavioural outcomes might be somewhat predefined or directed, VitaNova's interesting property lies in its unguided evolution of behavioural complexity, aligning more closely with natural selection in the biological world. This mirrors approaches in artificial life such as Tierra by Thomas Ray and PolyWorld by Larry Yaeger, where complex behaviors and structures arise from the interactions within the system Ray (1993); Yaeger (1994). This lack of explicit fitness criteria allows for the spontaneous emergence of organisational structures and survival strategies, underscoring VitaNova's potential to explore the foundations of adaptive systems and complexity evolution without human-imposed direction."}, {"title": "3.4 Distinction from Other ALife Models", "content": "VitaNova distinguishes itself in the artificial life (ALife) domain by its integration of self-organization and natural selection at the level of individual components, setting it apart from classical CA-based model like Conway's Game of Life Bak et al. (1989), and Langton's Loop Langton (1984), and the more recent Lenia Chan (2020). While these models excel in showcasing complex replicating patterns and complex behaviours emerging from simple rules through self-organization, they generally lack mechanisms for simulating evolution via natural selection for individual entities.\nCentral to VitaNova's design is the simultaneous operation of self-organization and natural selection processes. This dual mechanism ensures that while boids autonomously generate complex patterns and structures through interaction, they also evolve through natural selection based on their fitness-determined by their ability to navigate environmental challenges and reproduce. This results in a dynamic evolutionary landscape where adaptations are continually refined in response to shifting environmental pressures.\nVitaNova exemplifies the convergence of self-organization and natural selection, embodying a debate central to evolutionary theory. This platform demonstrates how individual boids, through interactions and fitness-driven natural selection, navigate and adapt to environmental pressures, leading to complex, emergent behaviours and evolutionary advancement. This synthesis addresses classical discussions, such as those between Stuart Kauffman, who emphasises self-organization's role in biological complexity, and John Maynard Smith, who underscores the primacy of natural selection Kauffman (1993); Smith (1993). Additionally, it resonates with more recent perspectives on the interplay between these forces in evolutionary processes, such as Weber and Depew (1996); Batten et al. (2008). VitaNova, by integrating these mechanisms at the individual level, offers insights into the ongoing debate about the origins of complex adaptive systems and the emergence of higher organizational levels in the natural world."}, {"title": "4. Further Discussion and Related Work", "content": "The quest to understand Evolutionary Transitions in Individuality (ETIs) has engaged scholars across disciplines, leading to a wealth of theoretical frameworks aimed at elucidating the complex processes that drive the emergence of higher-order biological organisations from simpler life forms. Seminal works by John Maynard Smith and E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry have proposed models that describe key stages and mechanisms in the hierarchical complexity evolution of life Szathm\u00e1ry (2015). Building on these foundations, recent contributions have expanded the discourse, introducing diverse perspectives that challenge and enrich our understanding of ETIs Szathm\u00e1ry (2015); Godfrey-Smith (2011).\nAmong these, Watson, Levin, and Buckley offer a comprehensive summary of current debates, highlighting viewpoints such as the challenge of defining levels of selection and individuality Okasha (2005), the role of genetic relatedness West et al. (2015) Watson et al. (2022). A contentious debate within the field revolves around the necessity and timing of higher-level selection mechanisms. Some theories propose that higher levels of individuality emerge through selection pressures acting on group traits, raising questions about the pre-existence of such selection mechanisms or their concurrent development with the transition itself. In addressing these complex themes, Watson et al. lean towards an explanation of ETIs that heavily favors the self-organization process, positing a less emphasized role for natural selection. They propose an intriguing parallel between evolutionary transitions and neural network learning, suggesting that the process of evolution by natural selection and the organization within neural networks might follow similar patterns of emergent behaviors and hierarchical organization from simple units Watson et al. (2022).\nThese models, while provide solid foundations, often remain abstract, exploring ETIs through mathematical and philosophical lenses without providing empirical demonstrations of the underlying processes Watson et al. (2022); West et al. (2015); Michod and Nedelcu (2003). A notable challenge within this theoretical exploration is the simulation of group reproduction a critical marker of ETIS which many models assume rather than demonstrate. This gap highlights a need for dynamic models that can capture the emergent behaviors and complex interactions leading to the spontaneous formation of cooperative, reproductive units Hanschen et al. (2015); Black et al. (2020).\nTransitioning from theoretical models to Artificial Life (ALife) simulations offers a promising avenue for addressing these limitations. ALife's potential in modelling complex biological phenomena has been recognized, yet realizing simulations that accurately reflect the dynamics of ETIs poses its own set of challenges. John E. Stewart, in his discussions on ALife's role in studying ETIs, emphasizes the difficulty of simulating these transitions without resorting to hierarchical control mechanisms akin to \"vertical bosses\" observed in natural systems like insect colonies. Stewart advocates for models that can account for the emergence of cooperative behavior and higher-order individuality through self-organizing processes, underscoring the importance of managerial roles in facilitating ETIs Stewart (1997, 2020).\nVitaNova diverges from these perspectives by integrating both self-organization and natural selection to demonstrate ETIs, even without the \"vertical boss\". Contrary to models that might prioritise self-organization processes with minimal engagement of selection, VitaNova showcases that the spontaneous emergence of collective reproduction, emblematic of ETIs, can result from the intricate interplay between evolving neuronal agents' self-organized behaviors and the selective pressures they encounter. This balanced approach not only highlights group reproduction but also serves as a dynamic model for investigating the conditions under which such higher-order biological organisation emerges, thus providing empirical insights into the spontaneous formation of cooperative, reproductive units.\nIn recent developments within artificial life research, the work of Moreno and Ofria (2019) on the DISHTINY platform presents a crucial step towards understanding fraternal"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion, and Future Avenues", "content": "This research elucidates ETIs by showcasing, via simulation, the emergence of reproductive groups from the synergy of self-organization and natural selection. Neuronal agents within our simulation autonomously evolve adaptive rules, leading to self-organized flocking behaviours.

For example, drought has cost the agricultural sector of California an estimated $1.7 billion in direct revenue losses and over 19,000 job losses in 2022 (Medellin-Azuara et al. 2022). Existing solutions have mainly focused on assessing drought severity with quantitative measurements, such as meteorological and hydrological records, and agricultural yield data (Dantas, da Silva, and Santos 2020; Becker and Sparks 2020). However, the underlying societal impact of drought (e.g., public health, ecosystem, recreation) has not been systematically explored, especially from human-centric perspectives. Motivated by the collective intelligence on social media in capturing human observations and experiences and the computational power of AI, this paper focuses on a novel problem of socially informed AI-driven drought estimation. Our goal is to jointly estimate drought severity and identify salient determinants of the societal impact precipitated by drought.\nA few recent efforts have been made to investigate the societal impact posed by drought (Sugg et al. 2020). These solutions have mainly focused on scientific measurements, such as meteorological and hydrological data, or economic losses in specific sectors like agriculture (Naumann et al. 2021). However, these approaches often overlook the diverse nature of drought's impact on human society, which often extends beyond quantifiable metrics and encompasses various aspects of the human community, such as public health, ecosystem, recreation, and tourism (Savelli et al. 2022). Moreover, traditional drought monitoring and assessment methods heavily rely on physical sensors and remote sensing technologies, which may not capture the diverse and localized perceptions of communities affected by drought (Savelli et al. 2022). The lack of human-centric perspectives in drought severity assessment can lead to an incomplete understanding of the societal impact and hinder the development of effective mitigation strategies that address the diverse needs and concerns of communities affected by drought.\nTo bridge this gap, in this paper, we study the problem of socially informed AI-driven drought estimation by leveraging the collective intelligence on social and news media to jointly estimate the severity and societal impact of drought. Social media platforms and online news outlets have become vital sources of timely, localized, and human-centric information during various natural disasters and crises (Bathaiy et al. 2021). Our proposed framework integrates physical drought severity indicators, social media data, and news media content to provide a comprehensive and human-centric estimation of drought severity and its societal impact. Specifically, while social media inputs reflect the observations and experiences of individual users, news media data offers broader coverage and more neutral perspectives of drought conditions and their consequences analyzed by professional journalists and domain experts. However, two technical challenges exist in developing such a framework."}, {"title": "Problem Statement", "content": "Definition 1 Time Step t: the collection period (e.g., weekly) during which the meteorological, social media, and news media data are collected. In particular, we define T \u2208 Z+ as the total number of time steps in our study and t is the tth time step.\nDefinition 2 Drought Severity Dt: the intensity of drought conditions (Dt \u2208 R) in the studied area at time step t. In particular, we adopt the Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) (Smith et al. 2020) as our primary meteorological metric for evaluating the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the studied areas. DSCI is a comprehensive numerical measurement that measures both drought intensity and its impacted area, and has been widely adopted by leading drought monitor agencies (e.g., drought.gov and U.S. Drought Monitor).\nDefinition 3 Social Input St: a set of drought-related social media posts published during the time step t.\nDefinition 4 News Input Nt: a set of drought-related new articles collected from leading news publishers during time step t.\nDefinition 5 Societal Impact Mt: the societal impact Mt of drought at time step t is the distribution of a set of d determinants specified by the National Integrated Drought Information System (National Integrated Drought Information System), including Agriculture, Ecosystems, Energy, Hazard Planning & Preparedness, Manufacturing, Navigation and Transportation, Public Health, Recreation and Tourism, Water Utilities, Wildfire Management, and Other. Formally, let Mt = [mt,1,mt,2,..., mt,\u03b4] where mt,i \u2200i \u2208 {1,2,..., \u03b4} represents the impact score for the i-th determinant at time step t. Each mt,i can be a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no impact and 1 indicates the most severe impact. We elaborate on the details of quantifying the societal impact from the social and news input in the Solution section."}, {"title": "Solution", "content": "In this section, we present SIDE, a socially informed drought estimation framework that jointly estimates drought severity and the underlying societal impact. Figure 2 shows an overview of the SIDE framework. In particular, SIDE contains three key modules: 1) a Determinant-Driven Societal Impact Quantification (DSIQ) module that explicitly quantifies the societal impact of drought by accurately transforming the social and news media data into a comprehensive set of determinants; 2) a Social-Physical Interdependency Extraction (SPIE) module that effectively captures the complex interdependency between the distribution of the extracted social determinants and physical drought severity indicator; 3) a Severity-Impact Joint Estimation (SIJE) module that leverages the cross-attended features from SPIE to jointly predict future drought severity and its societal impact.\nThe determinant-driven societal impact quantification (DSIQ) module is designed to effectively quantify the societal impact of drought by explicitly analyzing social input (Definition 3) and news input (Definition 4). We observe that the social input from social media discourse can provide valuable insights into public sentiment, concerns, and experiences related to drought. Similarly, news input, such as reports from local and national news outlets, can offer a comprehensive overview of the broader societal consequences of drought. However, the social input and news input are primarily unstructured text data, presenting challenges in extracting and quantifying the relevant information for assessing the societal impact of drought. For example, social media posts contributed by individual users often contain a non-trivial amount of noise, such as irrelevant information, opinions, and emotions that may not directly contribute to understanding the societal impact of drought.\nTo address such a challenge, we design a hierarchical determinant-driven information distillation strategy to effectively extract drought-related posts/articles from the social and news inputs and quantify their distribution across different societal impact determinants. In particular, the hierarchical determinant-driven information distillation strategy consists of two main steps. First, we extract the fine-grained topics from each social and news input to capture the diverse aspects of drought's societal impact on human communities. We employ the advanced unsupervised neural topic model, BERTopic (Grootendorst 2022), to discover the latent topics in the noisy text data from social and news inputs. Specifically, considering the varied linguistic characteristics of social media posts and news articles (e.g., language formality, writing style), we train two separate topic models using the social input and news input, denoted as Ts and Tn, respectively. For each topic model, we cluster the corresponding posts/articles into K topic clusters, denoted as Ts and Tn.\nSecond, we map the extracted topics to a pre-defined set of high-level societal impact determinants (Definition 5) and learn the distribution of the posts/articles across the determinants to explicitly quantify the societal impact of drought. A straightforward solution is to manually annotate the extracted topics with their corresponding determinants. However, such an approach is not only unscalable but also prone to the dynamic nature of the topics in the social media discourse and news articles as drought condition evolves. To address this challenge, we propose a large language model (LLM) assisted topic-determinant mapping approach that aims to incorporate the commonsense knowledge and natural language understanding capability of LLM to adaptively map the dynamic topics to the relevant societal impact determinants. In particular, we provide the extracted topics and the determinants as prompts and obtain the likelihood score for each topic-determinant pair. Finally, we assign each topic to the determinant with the highest likelihood score and aggregate the posts/articles associated with the topics to compute the distribution of the social media posts and news articles across the determinants. Formally, for a given time step t, we define the quantified societal impact as Mt = [Ms,t||Mn,t] where Ms,t, Mn,t \u2208 R\u03b4 are the normalized distribution of posts/articles across the determinants from the social input and news input, respectively. \u03b4 is the number of determinants. || is the concatenation operation. The quantified societal impact within the lookback window (Definition 6) will be utilized to estimate the drought severity and predict future societal impact.\nOur next objective is to effectively capture the interdependency between the quantified societal impact and drought severity (Definition 2). In particular, we observe that the quantified societal impact and drought severity exhibit complex interactions and dependencies. On one hand, the severity of drought directly influences the societal impact, as more severe drought conditions tend to lead to more significant consequences on various aspects of human society, such as agriculture, economy, and public health. On the other hand, the societal impact of drought can also provide valuable insights and early signals for estimating and predicting drought severity. For example, an increase in social media posts and news articles related to agricultural losses and water scarcity may indicate a worsening drought condition.\nTo capture such complex interdependency between the quantified societal impact and drought severity, we design a Social-Physical Interdependency Extraction (SPIE) module that designs a social-physical cross-attention mechanism to explicitly learn the hidden relation between the quantified societal impact and drought severity. In particular, we first encode the time series of quantified societal impact Mt-TL:t and drought severity Dt-TL:t within a lookback window of TL time steps using two separate encoders, fenc and fenc:\nHM = fenc(Mt-TL:t), HD = fenc(Dt-TL:t)\nwhere HM, HD \u2208 RTL\u00d7d are the encoded representations of Mt-TL:t and Dt-TL:t, and d is the hidden dimension. fenc and fenc are the transformer-based sequence encoders for the time series of the societal impact and drought severity, respectively.\nNext, we employ a social-physical cross-attention mechanism to capture the hidden relations between HM and HD. Specifically, we compute the query, key, and value matrices from HM and HD as:\nQM = HMWQ; KD = HDWR; VD = HDWV\nQD = HDWQ; KM = HMWW; VM = HMWV"}, {"title": "Severity-Impact Joint Estimation", "content": "The severity-impact joint estimation module is designed to jointly predict future drought severity and societal impact by leveraging the cross-attended representation learned from the SPIE module. Traditional time series forecasting models often focus on predicting single or multiple independent target variables based on their historical observations. However, in our problem of socially informed drought estimation, it is crucial to simultaneously estimate both the drought severity and the associated societal impact, as they are inherently interconnected and influence each other dynamically.\nTo address this challenge, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates the cross-attended features from the SPIE module to capture the complex interdependency between drought severity and societal impact. Specifically, let HMD \u2208 RTL\u00d7d and HDM \u2208 RTLxd denote the cross-attended representation learned from the SPIE module, where TL is the lookback window size and d is the hidden dimension. We first concatenate HMD and HDM to obtain a comprehensive representation H = [HMD||HDM] that captures the bidirectional interactions between drought severity and societal impact.\nWe then utilize a decoder network fdec to jointly predict the future drought severity and societal impact based on the cross-attended representation H. fdec takes H as input and generates the predictions for the next Tp time steps:\nfdec(H) = [Dt+1:t+Tp, Mt+1:t+Tp]\nwhere Dt+i \u2208 R and Mt+i \u2208 R are the predicted drought severity and quantified societal impact at time step t + i, respectively, and Tp is the prediction window size.\nWe optimize the SIDE framework by jointly considering the estimation error for both drought severity and societal impact. Specifically, we define the loss function as:\nTP\nL = \u2211(ADLD(Dt+i, Dt+i) + AMLM (Mt+i, Mt+i))\ni=1\nwhere LD and LM are the loss functions for drought severity and societal impact, respectively (e.g., mean squared error), and AD and AM are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of each task.\nBy jointly predicting the future drought severity and societal impact, the SIJE module provides more comprehensive estimation for drought severity and societal impact, aiming to support well-informed decision-making and resource allocation for drought mitigation and management."}, {"title": "Evaluation", "content": "In this section, we evaluate the performance of SIDE on estimating drought severity and its societal impact in different geographical areas. Evaluation results demonstrate that SIDE achieves substantial performance gains in accurately forecasting the drought severity.\nWe adopt the publicly available SocialDrought dataset (Shang et al. 2024) for evaluating the performance of SIDE. In particular, the SocialDrought dataset is a comprehensive drought dataset that contains the meteorological records of drought severity in the U.S. along with the relevant social media discourse from Twitter/X and credible news articles from mainstream news media. In our experiments, we focus on two states in the U.S., namely California (CA) and Texas (TX), as the primary geographical areas in our study due to their significant agricultural outputs, large and diverse populations, and vulnerability to drought conditions (Becker and Sparks 2020; Farahmand, Reager, and Madani 2021).\nWe retrieve the weekly DSCI (Definition 2), social media posts, and news articles from the SocialDrought dataset for each studied state (i.e., CA and TX) to be used as the ground-truth drought severity, social input, and news input, respectively. The social and news inputs are further utilized to compute the ground-truth societal impact using the quantification method introduced in the DSIQ module. In addition, we notice that only a limited amount of the social media posts and news articles in the SocialDrought dataset contain explicit geolocation information that could be used to retrieve relevant posts and articles in each state. To address this issue, we further filter the posts and articles with a list of state-specific location entities to retrieve posts and articles that are relevant to each state. This list of location entities includes major cities, counties, and landmarks specific to California and Texas, such as Los Angeles, Fresno, and Dallas. This approach allows us to obtain a comprehensive and state-specific dataset for our analysis, ensuring that the social media posts and news articles accurately reflect the drought conditions and public discourse within each state.\nIn our study, we primarily focus on the period from January 2017 to April 2023 where both California and Texas experienced several significant drought events (Kam, Stowers, and Kim 2019; Zhang et al. 2022). For example, California faced severe drought conditions, particularly in 2021, which was recorded as one of the driest years in the state's history (Seager et al. 2022). Similarly, Texas encountered extreme drought conditions in 2022, with many parts of the state experiencing exceptional drought, the highest level on the U.S. Drought Monitor scale (Weaver et al. 2023).\nWe plot the temporal variation of the DSCI and the amount of weekly social media posts and news articles of California and Texas. We observe that the temporal patterns of drought severity, social media activity, and news coverage exhibit notable correlations and fluctuations over time. Periods of increased drought severity often coincide with spikes in the volume of drought-related social media posts and news articles in both California and Texas. This suggests that social and news media show great potential for providing valuable insights into the societal impact of drought."}, {"title": "Baselines and Experimental Settings", "content": "Baselines We compare SIDE with a set of state-of-the-art multivariate time series forecasting solutions.\n\u2022 iTransformer (Liu et al. 2023): a transformer-based time series forecasting method that applies the attention and feed-forward network on inverted dimensions.\n\u2022 Koopa (Liu et al. 2024): a deep learning approach that utilizes Koopman theory to separate time-variant and time-invariant components in time series forecasting.\n\u2022 TimesNet (Wu et al. 2022): a neural network architecture that leverages tensor transformation to capture intra- and inter-period variations for time series forecasting.\n\u2022 One-Fits-All (Zhou et al. 2024): a pre-trained language and vision model with fine-tuning for downstream time series forecasting tasks.\n\u2022 RWKV-TS (Hou and Yu 2024): an RNN-based sequential forecasting approach that is designed to capture the long-term temporal dependencies in time series data.\nExperimental Settings To ensure a fair comparison, we use the same input in SIDE and all compared baseline models, including the DSCI records, transformed social and news inputs, and their corresponding time steps.

A higher value (\u2191) of MFA and lower values (\u2193) of MAE, MSE, and RMSE indicate better estimation performance. We compare the predicted drought severity with the ground-truth drought severity in the prediction window.\nWe summarize the evaluation results for California and Texas, respectively. We observe that SIDE achieves significant performance gains compared to the baseline methods across all evaluation metrics on both the California and Texas datasets, demonstrating its ability to accurately estimate drought severity. For example, SIDE outperforms the best-performing baseline (i.e., TimesNet) on the California dataset by 26.25% and 10.05% in terms of reducing the MAE and MSE, respectively. We observe similar performance improvements on the Texas dataset. The improvement can be attributed to the social-physical cross-attention mechanism that effectively captures the complex interdependence between dynamic physical conditions and societal impact influencing drought severity."}, {"title": "Societal Impact Estimation Performance", "content": "We evaluate the societal impact estimation performance of the SIJE module.

We compare the societal impact predicted by SIJE with the ground-truth societal impact computed by DSIQ on the prediction window. We observe that SIJE accurately captures the distribution of the societal impact determinants for both states. In addition, we observe that, while \"water utilities\u201d is the most concerning determinant for both states, California and Texas exhibit distinct patterns in the relative importance of other determinants. For example, \u201cagriculture\" is shown to be more concerned in California while \u201cecosystem\" and \u201cpublic health\" are more prominent in Texas. More importantly, we notice that the distribution of the societal impact determinants extracted from the social input and news input also varied (e.g., \"wildfire management\" in California), demonstrating the importance of considering both social and news inputs to comprehensively estimate the societal impact of drought."}, {"title": "Ablation Study", "content": "We further conduct an ablation study to investigate the contribution of the key components in the SIDE framework."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The proposed SIDE framework can be deployed as a real-time drought monitoring and forecasting system.

{"title": "Belief Information based Deep Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems", "authors": ["Jialong Xu", "Liu Liu", "Xin Wang", "Lan Chen"], "abstract": "In the next generation wireless communication system, transmission rates should continue to rise to support emerging scenarios, e.g., the immersive communications. From the perspective of communication system evolution, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology remains pivotal for enhancing transmission rates. However, current MIMO systems rely on inserting pilot signals to achieve accurate channel estimation. As the increase of transmit stream, the pilots consume a significant portion of transmission resources, severely reducing the spectral efficiency. In this correspondence, we propose a belief information based mechanism. By introducing a plug-and-play belief information module, existing single-antenna channel estimation networks could be seamlessly adapted to multi-antenna channel estimation and fully exploit the spatial correlation among multiple antennas. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can either improve 1 ~ 2 dB channel estimation performance or reduce 1/3 ~ 1/2 pilot overhead, particularly in bad channel conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Compared to the existing fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication system, 6G will be designed to support significantly higher throughput, accommodating potential high data-rate applications, e.g., the immersive extended reality (XR), holographic communications, and the digital twin. Building on the success the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) employed in 4G and 5G, these technologies may be further enhanced to meet the increased throughput demand of 6G.\nPilot-assisted channel estimation is designed to mitigate wireless channel impairment using pilot signals in existing wireless communication systems. However, as the number of required required data streams increases, the proportion of pilot signals in transmission resources also rises, reducing spectral efficiency (SE) and neutralizing the benefit of larger MIMO configurations.\nIn recent years, the success of deep learning (DL) in the computer vision domain and natural language processing domain enlightened researchers to redesign DL-based algorithms to enhance conventional communication modules, e.g., channel state information (CSI) feedback [1] and beam management [2], or to design the entire communication system with an end-to-end manner, e.g., joint source-channel coding [3] and joint transceiver designs [4]. Meanwhile, benefiting from the similarity between the channel estimation task, which maps the channel estimated at pilot positions to the full estimated channel, and the super-resolution task, which maps a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image, DL is introduced to channel estimation [5]. Then efficient neural network architectures are introduced and redesigned for DL-based channel estimation with the consideration of wireless channel characteristics. For instance, the residual network, the transformer, and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer inspire the design of ReEsNet [6], Channelformer [7] and CMixer [8], respectively, to improve the channel estimation accuracy.\nHowever, the aforementioned DL-based channel estimation methods typically assume the channel estimation for the single antenna, thereby overlooking the spatial relationship among multiple receiving antennas. In this correspondence, we propose a belief information based mechanism for multiple-antenna channel estimation. Inspired by the maximum ratio combination (MRC) algorithm, which assigns greater weight to stronger signals and less to weaker ones, this mechanism uses multi-antenna belief information to assign different weights to various spatial features within the channel estimation network. This approach fully leverages the correlation among multiple antennas, enhancing overall channel estimation accuracy.\nThe rest of the correspondence is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system model for channel estimation of multiple receiving antennas. A belief information based mechanism is proposed in Section III. Section IV evaluates the proposed method in terms of channel estimation accuracy, pilot overhead reduction, storage overhead and computational complexity. Finally, Section V concludes our work."}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "As shown in Fig. 1, we consider the downlink transmission of the massive MIMO-OFDM system across \\(N_c\\) subcarriers. The base station (BS) and the user equipment (UE) are equipped with \\(N_t\\) antennas and \\(N_r\\) antennas, respectively. Each OFDM slot consists of \\(N_l\\) OFDM symbols. For the \\(i\\)-th subcarrier, the downlink channel is represented as \\(H(i) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N_r \\times N_t}\\).\nAt the BS, the transmitted bit streams \\(B \\in \\{0,1\\}^{N \\times R \\times M}\\) is mapped to the data stream signals \\(X_D \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N_s \\times R}\\) by the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) of order \\(2^M\\), where \\(R\\)"}, {"title": "III. BELIEF INFORMATION BASED DEEP CHANNEL ESTIMATION", "content": "Compared with traditional channel estimation methods, DL-based channel approaches can achieve higher channel estimation accuracy and thus reduce pilot overhead. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, existing DL-based channel estimation methods are primarily tailored for single-antenna channel estimation, despite the deployment of multiple antennas at the UE side in 5G and beyond systems. In this section, we design a belief information based mechanism that fully"}, {"title": "A. Belief Information", "content": "Owing to its simplicity, most DL-based channel estimation methods utilize the LS method at pilot positions to obtain the initial channel estimate. For a data stream, the LS estimate of the i-th receiving antenna is expressed as follows:\n\\[\nG_{LS}^{(i)} = \\frac{Y^{(i)}}{X}\n\\]\nand the mean square error (MSE) of the LS channel estimate is expressed as:\n\\[\nMSE(G_{LS}^{(i)}) = \\frac{\\sigma_a^{2(i)}}{\\sigma_s^{2(i)}} = \\frac{1}{SNR^{(i)}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_s^{2(i)}\\) and \\(\\sigma_a^{2(i)}\\) denote the i-th power of the signals and the the i-th power of the noise, respectively. Note that the MSE\\((G_{LS}^{(i)})\\) in Eq. (8) is inversely proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \\(\\sigma_s^{2(i)} / \\sigma_a^{2(i)}\\). The MSE serves as an indicator of the reliability of \\(G_{LS}^{(i)}\\). Specifically, when the equivalent channel \\(G^{(i)}\\) is in good condition, i.e., high SNR, the small MSE suggests that \\(G_{LS}^{(i)}\\) closely approximates its true value with high probability. Conversely, a low SNR leads a high MSE, increasing the uncertainty of \\(G_{LS}^{(i)}\\). Here, we define the SNR of the i-th antenna as its belief information.\nConsidering the existing DL-based channel estimation methods for a single antenna, the straightforward approach is to adjust their input (i.e., the LS estimate \\(G_{LS}\\)) and output (i.e., the equivalent channel \\(G\\)) to suit the multiple-antenna scenario, learning their weights with a data-driven manner. However, without integrating communication knowledge, i.e., belief information, these adapted channel estimation networks struggle to fully exploit the spatial relationships among multiple antennas."}, {"title": "B. Belief Information Module", "content": "As shown in the left part of Fig. 2, the belief information module (BIM) is expressed as follows:\n\\[\nS = \\sigma(W_2 \\delta(W_1 I + b_1) + b_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C}.\n\\]\nwhere \\(I = [\\mu_1, \\mu_2,\\cdots, \\mu_{N_r}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_r}\\) serves as the input of the BIM module, and \\(S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C}\\) is the output with c dimensions. Each \\(\\mu_i\\) denotes the SNR of the i-th receiving antenna, which can be calculated using Eq. (8). The BIM comprises two fully connected (FC) layers, each equiped with activation functions. \\(W_1\\) and \\(b_1\\) are the weights and the bias of the first FC layer, while \\(W_2\\) and \\(b_2\\) are the weights and the bias of the second FC layer. The activation functions \\(\\delta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) represent the ReLU and sigmoid functions, respectively.\nIt is worth noting that we do not adopt complex network architectures for the BIM. This simple and efficient structure has been demonstrated effective in our previous research [3], where we design an attention feature (AF) module. The AF module dynamically recalibrate the features extracted by the convolution layer, considering both the source and channel"}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "content": "The following experiments are conducted in the 5G urban macro (UMa) scenario. To demonstrate its compatibility, we select 5G mapping type A configuration type 1 signal-symbol demodulation reference signal (DMRS) as the pilot signals. The DMRSs are spaced by 2 subcarriers and are located in the 2nd and the 11th OFDM symbols within an OFDM slot. The Detailed configuration parameters are provided in Table I. For network training, we generate 400,000 training samples and 20,000 validation samples by Sionna [12], under a uniform distribution over the EbNo range of [-20, 0] dB. EbNo denotes the ratio of transmit energy per bit to the receiving noise power spectral density. In the evaluation stage, 10,000 test samples are tested at every single EbNo value. Normalized MSE (NMSE) serves as the performance metric.\nAs detailed in Section III-B, the BIM is designed to enhance the primary elements of channel estimation networks. In this study, we adapt three channel estimation networks to accommodate the task of multiple-antenna channel estimation and integrate the proposed BIM with them. The first network, ReEsNet [6], is a fully convolutional network. The input of ReEsNet is extended from (\\(N_{cp}\\), \\(N_{lp}\\), 2) to (\\(N_{cp}\\), \\(N_{lp}\\), 2x\\(N_r\\)) and the output from (\\(N_c\\), \\(N_l\\), 2) to (\\(N_c\\), \\(N_l\\), 2x\\(N_r\\)). The number of convolution channels is also extended to 96 to boost its channel estimation ability. The second network, Channelformer [7], is composed of one transformer layer and convolution layers. Besides the extension of the input shape and output shape, the transformer layer needs two-dimensional data to deal with. Following the method of coupling LS matrices with the transformer layer in [7], the frequency dimension (i.e., \\(N_{cp}\\)) and the time dimension (i.e., \\(N_{lp}\\)) are grouped as one dimension shown in Fig. 2(c), and the channels are increased from 2 (representing the real part and the image part) to 2x\\(N_r\\). To modify the last network CMixer [8], we extend its input and output and group the time dimension and space dimension together as shown in Fig. 2(d). To simplify terminology, the modified networks retain their original names, and the networks enhanced by BIM are called \"BReEsNet\", \"BChannelformer\" and \"BCMixer\". Adam is adopted to optimize the network during the training stage. The batch size, learning rate, and training epoch are set to 128, 0.001, and 100, respectively.\nFig. 3 compares the channel estimation networks enhanced by BIM with the basic channel estimation networks with 48 pilots. Conventional channel estimation methods, i.e., NN, LIN, and LMMSE, serve as references. With the integration of belief information, the performance of BReEsNet, BChannelformer, and BCMixer are 2 dB, 1 dB, and 1 dB better than that of ReEsNet, Channelformer, and CMixer at \\(E_bNo = -20\\) dB, respectively. Compared with Channelformer, the performance gain of BChannelformer is reduced with the increase of \\(E_bNo\\). A similar trend is observed when comparing BCmixer with CMixer. Conversely, the inverse tendency is that the performance gain increases when comparing BReEsNet with ReEsNet, potentially due to the use of different backbone networks in these comparisons. Moreover, as illustrated in"}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "We have proposed the belief information based channel estimation mechanism that leverages the belief information extracted from multiple antennas to efficiently explore the spatial relationships among them. In the experiments, we have demonstrated that the proposed BIM is a plug-and-play module, which is easily integrated into existing channel estimation networks and improves channel estimation accuracy. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method could achieve the performance gain or pilot overhead reduction, particularly in environments with low EbNos. In future work, promising directions involves extending the application of the proposed BIM to the task of DL-based joint channel estimation and detection, as well as to DL-based receiver designs."}]}

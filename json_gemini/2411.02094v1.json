Most existing BCI studies focused on improving the decoding accuracy, with only a few considering the adversarial security. Although many adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in other application domains such as computer vision, previous research showed that their direct extensions to BCIs degrade the classification accuracy on benign samples. This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary. The integration of data alignment and adversarial training can make the trained EEG classifiers simultaneously more accurate and more robust. Experiments on five EEG datasets from two different BCI paradigms (motor imagery classification, and event related potential recognition), three convolutional neural network classifiers (EEGNet, ShallowCNN and DeepCNN) and three different experimental settings (offline within-subject cross-block/-session classification, online cross-session classification, and pre-trained classifiers) demonstrated its effectiveness. It is very intriguing that adversarial attacks, which are usually used to damage BCI systems, can be used in ABAT to simultaneously improve the model accuracy and robustness.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a direct communication channel connecting the human brain and a computer [1]. Electroencephalogram (EEG), which records the brain's electrical activities from the scalp, is the most commonly utilized input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its affordability and ease of use [2]. An EEG-based BCI system typically includes four components: signal acquisition, signal processing, machine learning, and controller, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nMost prior research on EEG decoding primarily focused on the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning algorithms [3]. Nonetheless, a critical discovery by Zhang and Wu [4] revealed that adversarial examples, generated using unsupervised fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [5], can significantly degrade the performance of deep learning classifiers in EEG-based BCIs. They introduced an attack framework that transforms a benign EEG epoch into an adversarial one by injecting a jamming module before machine learning to add adversarial perturbations, as depicted in Fig. 2. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [6] demonstrated that adversarial examples can also fool traditional machine learning classifiers in BCI spellers, misleading them to output an arbitrary (incorrect) character specified by the attacker. Liu et al. [7] and Jung et al. [8] developed approaches to generate universal adversarial perturbations for EEG-based BCIs, making adversarial attacks much easier to implement. Bian et al. [9] employed simple square wave signals to generate adversarial examples, for attacking steady-state visual evoked potential based BCIs. Wang et al. [10] investigated physically constrained adversarial attacks to BCIS. Meng et al. [11] also performed adversarial attacks in EEG-based BCI regression problems.\nAdversarial attacks to EEG-based BCIs could have various consequences, from mere user frustration to life-threatening accidents. As pointed out in [12], \u201cIn BCI spellers for Amy-otrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients, adversarial attacks may hijack the user's true input and output wrong letters. The user's intention may be manipulated, or the user may feel too frustrated to use the BCI speller, losing his/her only way to communicate with others. In BCI-based driver drowsiness estimation [13], adversarial attacks may manipulate the output of the BCI system and increase the risk of accidents. In EEG-based awareness evaluation/detection for disorder of consciousness patients [14], adversarial attacks may disturb the true responses of the patients and lead to misdiagnosis.\" In military applications, adversarial attacks to BCIs may generate false commands, potentially causing friendly fire [15]. Consequently, it is very important to develop BCI machine learning models that are robust against adversarial attacks.\nMany adversarial defense approaches have been proposed in the literature [16]\u2013[18], among which robust training [19] may be the most classical and effective strategy. Adversarial training (AT) [16] is a representative robust training approach, and many other approaches [17], [18] can be regarded as its variants. AT solves a minimax problem (the saddle point problem). During training, AT generates adversarial examples along gradients that increase the model's loss to the input, and then minimizes the model's loss on these adversarial examples repeatedly [16]. This process aims to minimize the model's loss on adversarial examples, but does not explicitly optimize the performance on benign examples. Many studies [16], [20]\u2013[22] have shown that robust training may result in a significant decrease of the accuracy on benign samples, which is undesirable.\nFew studies have explored the possibility of improving the machine learning performance using adversarial examples. For image classification, Xie et al. [23] employed a separate auxiliary batch normalization for adversarial examples to prevent model overfitting. For EEG classification, Ni et al. [24] used a loss on adversarial examples to improve the cross-subject and cross-state transfer learning performance. However, Li et al. [21] and Meng et al. [22] have shown that conventional robust training approaches usually lead to an evident reduction in BCI model accuracy on benign samples, i.e., it is difficult to achieve both high accuracy and good robustness through robust training.\nRobust models aim to maintain good classification performance under adversarial attacks, which is important in safety-critical applications. However, the accuracy degradation of robust models on benign samples seriously affects their adaption. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT) to align EEG data for each session before performing robust training on them. This simple approach can be readily used in deep model training. After ABAT, the model's classification accuracy on benign samples and robustness on adversarial samples can simultaneously be improved. Experiments on five datasets using two different BCI paradigms, three classifiers and three different experimental settings demonstrated its effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first work on simultaneously improving the accuracy and robustness of the classifiers in EEG-based BCIs, and also the first time that EEG data alignment has been used in BCI adversarial defense. We hope that our findings can inspire more future research on robust EEG classifiers."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "This section introduces background knowledge on EEG data alignment, adversarial attacks, and AT."}, {"title": "A. Euclidean Alignment", "content": "EEG data from different subjects/sessions can be regarded as data from different domains. Due to inter-subject/-session variations, the marginal probability distributions of EEG tri-als from different subjects/sessions are usually (significantly) different [25]. Consequently, it is important to perform EEG data alignment to reduce the domain discrepancy.\nVarious EEG data alignment approaches have been pro-posed, which are reviewed and compared in [26]. Zanini et al. [27] introduced Riemannian alignment to align the covariance matrices of EEG trials from different subjects in the Riemannian space. He and Wu [28] extended Riemannian alignment to Euclidean alignment (EA), which aligns the raw EEG trials in the Euclidean space. EA is efficient and com-pletely unsupervised, demonstrating promising performance in different BCI paradigms [29].\nFor N EEG trials $\\{X_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ in a particular domain, EA first computes the Euclidean arithmetic mean R of all N spatial covariance matrices:\n$R= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N X_n(X_n)^T$\nThen, it performs the alignment by:\n$X_n = R^{-1/2} X_n, n = 1, ..., N$\nAfter EA, the aligned EEG trials $\\{X_n\\}_{n=1}^N$ in each domain are whitened, i.e., their average spatial covariance matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, EEG data distributions from different domains become more consistent."}, {"title": "B. Incremental EA", "content": "In online applications, target domain EEG trials $X_t$ arrive one by one on-the-fly, so there is a need to perform incremental EA on them.\nIncremental EA applies EA to online EEG classification [30]. Let $R_n$ be the average spatial covariance matrix com-puted from the first n target domain EEG trials. When the (n + 1)-th target domain EEG trial $X_{n+1}$ arrives, we first update:\n$R_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{n+1}[nR_n + X_{n+1}(X_{n+1})^T]$\nand then perform EA on $X_{n+1}$ using:\n$X_{n+1} = (R_{n+1})^{-1/2}X_{n+1}$"}, {"title": "C. Adversarial Attack", "content": "Adversarial examples should closely resemble benign ones, achieved by imposing constraints on the perturbation mag-nitude. Let D be a distance matric (a common choice is the $l_p$ norm), and $X^{adv}$ an adversarial example satisfying $D(X^{adv}, X) < \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ regulates the magnitude of the perturbation.\nWe consider the following three representative adversarial attack approaches:\n1) Fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [5], a straightfor-ward yet highly effective adversarial attack strategy. It constructs an adversarial example through a single-step gradient computation:\n$X^{adv} = X + \\epsilon sign (\\nabla_X \\mathcal{L}(C_\\theta(X), y))$,\nwhere $C_\\theta$ is a classifier with parameter $\\theta$, and $\\mathcal{L}$ its loss function. FGSM perturbs the input along the gradient direction, increasing the classifier's loss on its true label and leading to misclassification.\n2) Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [16], which is an iterative extension of FGSM. It starts from a perturbed version of the benign example X:\n$X^{adv} = X + \\xi$,\nwhere $\\xi$ is uniform random noise sampled from $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. The iterative step is given by:\n$X^{adv}_{t+1} = Proj_{X,\\epsilon}(X^{adv}_t + \\alpha \\cdot sign (\\nabla_{X^{adv}_t} \\mathcal{L}(C_\\theta(X^{adv}_t), y)))$,\nwhere $\\alpha < \\epsilon$ is the step size. The function $Proj_{X,\\epsilon}$ ensures that $X^{adv}$ remains within the $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of X according to the $l_p$ norm.\n3) AutoAttack [31], which combines four distinct attack strategies, including two budget-aware step size-free PGD variants with different losses (cross-entropy loss, and difference of logits ratio loss), square attack [32], and fast adaptive boundary attack [33], each serving a unique purpose. AutoAttack is parameter-free, and has demonstrated superior performance in defeating various defense approaches [31]."}, {"title": "D. AT", "content": "AT [16] is a classical robust training approach for enhancing the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks, i.e., improving the model accuracy on adversarial examples by adding them to the training data.

ALIGNMENT-BASED ADVERSARIAL TRAINING (ABAT)", "content": "AT aims at learning model parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the model's loss $\\mathcal{L}$ on training samples' strong adversarial examples $X^{adv}$, i.e., to increase its robustness. AT is one of the most effective adversarial defense approaches. However, it often comes at the cost of reduced accuracies on benign examples. This paper studies whether AT can be used to improve the model's robustness and accuracy simultaneously. Ni et al. [24] were the first to include the loss on adversarial examples in the overall model training loss function in EEG classification, to improve the transfer learning classification accuracy. However, they did not consider the adversarial robustness. Li et al. [21] and Meng et al. [22] showed that frequently, robust training, one of the most popular adversarial defense approaches, degrades the accuracy of BCI models. This may be due to the lack of EEG data alignment to reduce the data discrepancy among different subjects or different sessions. Multiple EEG data aliment approaches have been proposed, e.g., Riemannian alignment [27], EA [28] and label alignment [35]. They greatly improve the classification accuracy in traditional transfer learning scenarios [26]. However, EEG dat alignment has not been used in BCI adversarial defense.\nWe propose a very simple yet effective ABAT to fill this gap, by performing EEG data alignment before AT. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and AT further robustifies the classification boundary, as illustrated in Fig. 3. EA is used in this paper, for its simplicity and effectiveness.\nAlgorithm 1 gives the pseudo-code of ABAT. It first aligns the EEG data of each domain using EA, and then performs adversarial training.\nThe complete BCI flowchart with ABAT consists of data acquisition, data preprocessing (EEG data epoching and fil-tering), data alignment, AT, and model evaluation (in terms of accuracy and robustness), as shown in Fig. 4. Particularly, after preprocessing the EEG data, ABAT is used to train the EEG classifier, which is then used in subsequent classification and robustness evaluation."}, {"title": "IV.

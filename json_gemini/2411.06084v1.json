INTRODUCTION", "content": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), enabling significant advancements in tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and conversational agents. Models like GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, and PaLM, boasting 540 billion parameters, have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. These models leverage vast amounts of data and intricate architectures to achieve high performance, often surpassing previous benchmarks and setting new standards in the industry. However, the impressive capabilities of LLMs come at a substantial computational and financial cost. Training such models requires extensive computational resources, including powerful GPUs or TPUs, vast memory, and significant energy consumption. Moreover, the inference phase-where the model is deployed to perform tasks-demands considerable computational power and memory bandwidth, which can limit the feasibility of deploying LLMs on devices with constrained resources [1], such as mobile phones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and edge computing platforms. This limitation poses a significant barrier to the widespread adoption and accessibility of LLMs, particularly in applications where low latency and high efficiency are critical.\nQuantization in neural networks offers a promising solution to these challenges by reducing the precision of model parameters and activations. Typically, neural network weights and activations are represented using 32-bit floating-point (FP32) numbers, which provide high precision but consume substantial memory and computational resources. Quantization techniques convert these high-precision values to lower-bit representations, such as 8-bit integers (INT8), 4-bit integers (INT4), or even binary representations [2]. This reduction not only decreases the memory footprint of the model but also accelerates computations by leveraging hardware optimizations designed for lower precision arithmetic. In the context of LLMs, which often consist of billions of parameters, quantization becomes particularly beneficial. By reducing the model size, quantization facilitates the deployment of LLMs on devices with limited computational capabilities and power budgets. Additionally, lower-precision computations can significantly speed up inference times, enabling real-time applications and reducing operational costs.\nDespite these advantages, quantization presents challenges, including potential degradation in model accuracy and the complexity of implementing effective quantization strategies. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of quantization techniques applied to LLMs, exploring their methodologies, benefits, challenges, and future directions."}, {"title": "II.

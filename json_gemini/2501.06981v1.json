The people posting the tasks are known\nas \"requesters\". Both crowdworkers and requesters can be located around the world [54]. Crowdworkers frequently\nperform small discrete tasks that collectively contribute to a larger project or goal [15, 54]. For instance, they might\nannotate images or videos to enhance AI services', leading to improved experiences for end users [15, 54]. Workers\nusually perform the tasks for monetary gain [15, 54]. Some of these tasks can include annotating, labeling, or translating\ndata [54]. The labor that crowdworkers conduct is known as \"crowd work\". Crowdsourcing platforms include sites like\nToloka, Amazon Mechanical Turk, or Appen [15, 54]\nAn interesting dynamic that has emerged in crowd work, is that most crowdworkers are in the Global South [61],\nwhile most requesters are in the Global North [61]. This can lead to a significant cultural gap between the requester and\nthe worker, influencing differing opinions on optimal work practices, the kind of technical support that crowdsourcing"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "This section delves into the unique struggles of crowdworkers in various regions of the Global South to emphasize the\ncritical distinctions between their experiences. Next, we highlight the need for formal research regarding crowd work in\nLatin America and the Caribbean, as we know little about their personal experiences and challenges. To contextualize\nour focus on the Global South, we then discuss Western companies' exploitation of crowdworkers in the Global North\nand the impact of these same companies expanding their reach into the Global South, known as digital colonialism.\nCombining these topics motivates us by exposing knowledge gaps surrounding the challenges and opportunities of\ncrowdworkers in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nBefore continuing, we define our stances on gender, feminism, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the terms\nGlobal South/Global North:\n\u2022 Gender: We, as researchers, understand and recognize that gender is a social construct, and there are many\ndifferent gender expressions. We do not subscribe to a strict gender binary. However, in our results, there is a\nfifty-fifty split between men and women in data where participants self-identify.\n\u2022 Feminism: We define feminism as equal opportunity for everyone regardless of gender. We subscribe to inter-\nsectional forms of feminism where women are liberated regardless of race, class, sexual orientation, or gender\nidentity.\n\u2022 Latin America and the Caribbean: We, as researchers, do not hold a monolithic view of Latin America and the\nCaribbean. We understand that all Latin American and Caribbean countries have their own cultures, practices,\nand values.\n\u2022 Global South/Global North The terms Global South and Global North began being used during the start of\nglobalization, where scholaar Carl Oglesby [55], differentiated upwardly mobile communities (Global North)\nand lower standing economies (Global South) to justify the exploitation of goods and services. However, we\nunderstand these global binaries reproduce harmful rhetoric of what is considered a \"developing\", \"upwardly\nmobile\" or \"under-developed\" country. Through the use of a global binary, we see \"the entangled histories of\nmodernity, colonialism, and capitalism\" [30] that is present within globalization. We use this terminology to\nacknowledge the disenfranchisement of crowdworkers based on their geographical location and the growing\nexploitation by the Global North when working with other countries. We do not support rhetoric that portrays\ncountries of the Global South as inferior or underdeveloped."}, {"title": "2.1 Problems Facing Crowdworkers Globally", "content": "Most crowd work research initially fixated on enhancing the speed and quality of crowdworkers' tasks [12, 45].\nRegrettably, the individual experiences of these workers were largely disregarded [26]. Only recently have researchers\nbegun to conduct interviews with crowdworkers [2], offering insight into their identities and the challenges they endure.\nThe delay is partly due to a more recent growing emphasis on studying crowdworkers' experiences within specific\nregions [2] as they are not a uniform group [23]. This crucial realization has made it a priority for researchers to better\nunderstand crowdworkers' identities and requirements. Awareness of workers' unique cultural differences is vital for\ndesigning improved tools and platforms tailored to their diverse needs.\nEven with this forward step, studying crowdworkers and their experiences on a global scale still presents a challenge\ndue to the multitude of terms used to describe these individuals and their roles. The terminology associated with\ncrowdworkers has evolved, resulting in a myriad of names, including: \u201cClickworkers,\u201d \u201cTurkers\u201d (referring to Amazon"}, {"title": "2.1.1 Colonialism and Crowd Work", "content": "Digital colonialism is a form of neo-colonialism that refers to the exploitation of\nthe Global South by the West through control of their digital ecosystems [13]. It occurs when Big Tech companies profit\nby extracting data from users around the globe without their consent or fair compensation, all the while centralizing\npower by maintaining digital infrastructures in their respective countries, a prime example being the U.S. Due to these\ncorporations' vast influence, they can expand their services to reach users worldwide, preventing local innovators and\nindustries from flourishing and becoming competitors to those in the West. Big Tech companies perpetuate power\nimbalances and reinforce existing inequalities by creating and nurturing digital dependencies where they control where\nand how data is stored and used. Additionally, they make the software they develop proprietary, meaning users cannot\nview or modify programs for their benefit or protection. Each time these companies deploy a new product or service\nunder the pretense of altruism, they reinvigorate the exploitative cycle and concentrate even more power for themselves\n[41]. This process is prominent in crowd work, made evident through powerful Western companies and the workers\nthey decide to target to provide them with data. In crowdsourcing, a substantial amount of work is conducted worldwide,\nwith a large portion completed by crowdworkers from the Global South [68]. The tasks achieved by crowdworkers\nfrom developing countries are then utilized to benefit requesters and companies in developed economies [37]. For\ninstance, Indian crowdworkers might be assigned to label images for AI services, which are then utilized by UK-based\ntechnological companies and startups [26, 43]. This observation has prompted researchers to propose that crowd work\nperpetuates historical systems of production and exploitation from European colonialism [25, 59, 69], as is described by\nthe term digital colonialism."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "In this section, we present our survey design, recruitment procedures, and data analysis methods."}, {"title": "3.1 Survey Design", "content": "To comprehend the experiences of individuals from Latin America and the Caribbean who work on the Toloka\ncrowdsourcing platform, we developed two surveys (one in Spanish and one in English, the latter targeting regions\nprimarily English-speaking, such as the Caribbean Islands and South America).

Figure 1 displays a heat map\nshowing the countries where our participants currently reside, all of whom are originally from those countries (i.e.,\ncountry of residence and country of origin were the same for all participants). Most of our participants were from\nVenezuela (36%) and Brazil (24%).

Furthermore,\n25% of the participants had received technical vocational training.\nWe also examined participants' marital status, their desire for connections with other workers, and the various\ntools they use for connecting (see Fig 2). Our interest in marital status stemmed from prior research indicating that a\nsubstantial number of women crowdworkers in the global South, like India, tend to be married, with their husbands\noften managing their platform earnings [77].

Some of the workers also felt these connections could provide them with access to alternative help that could\nsurpass the capabilities of official platform support: \"In the event of an issue arising, a fellow worker could offer an\nexplanation, potentially leading to a quicker resolution compared to reaching out to technical support\" (P2).\nOur participants thus demonstrated an awareness of the significance of connecting with each other.

This result is consistent with previous research in crowd and gig work, which has\nshown that workers often experience feelings of isolation and lack of collaboration [33] brought on by the optimization\nof the platform. However, particularly interesting was that some of our participants expressed that they did \"not\ninterested in having contact with other workers\u201d (P52). Some also held negative perceptions of their peers, which likely\nincreased their alienation and deterred them from trying to connect with others. Specifically, there was a tendency\nto view other workers as \"foreigners\" who were solely interested in \"easy money\" and were indifferent towards the\nquality of their work: \u201cThey [other workers] are people from different countries, and most of them only care about trying to\nmake a quick buck, regardless of the quality of their work (P35).", "believed": "I do not feel that we should even worry about collaborations, because it has nothing to do\nwith what we do at Toloka (P72).\" The reluctance to engage with fellow workers could partly stem from past negative\nencounters while attempting to connect with the official support of the crowdsourcing platform and with requesters.\nUnfortunately, these attempts yielded no response, fostering an apprehension towards seeking connections with others:\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"4.3 Respect for Crowd Work.\",\n      \"content\": \"From our survey, participants 'agreed' (Mean = 3.95, SD = 1.23, Median = 4) that their family and friends held respect\nfor the work they perform on crowdsourcing platforms: this was further represented when participants said \\\"My family\nlikes seeing me work on crowdsourcing platforms", "work": "My family knows this job is real, and that\nI need my own time and space to complete it\u201d (P7).

This aspect highlights the empowering nature\nof crowd work, particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean region, offering individuals the opportunity to exert\ncontrol over their labor, their time, and advance their professional and personal goals. Remarkably, this result contrasts\nwith findings in India [77], where Indian women did not enjoy the same level of freedom in conducting crowd work.\nInstead, Indian women often worked under the supervision of their husbands, limiting their autonomy in this domain.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"5 DISCUSSION\",\n      \"content\": \"In this section, we present a discussion of the results and connect them to prior literature on the topic of crowd work.\nOur findings provide insight into the relationship between crowdworkers within Latin America and how Toloka treats\nthese workers.

They consistently reported that their sense\nof isolation was not self-imposed; rather, it was primarily attributed to the platform's emphasis on rewarding efficiency\nrather than fostering interpersonal connections.\nFrom this, it becomes apparent that crowdsourcing platforms, like Toloka, likely cultivate a culture that prioritizes and\nrewards workers' competition with one another, rather than encouraging collaboration. Related, it is well-documented\nthat some crowdsourcing platforms employ a deceptive tactic by simulating community promotion [65, 74], only\nto exploit it as a means to manipulate workers into competing with each other and coercing them into performing\nadditional labor. For example, Austin Toomb's work on Uber and Lyft's marketing campaigns found that the companies\nfalsely advertised feelings of a caring ethos in the hopes to gain more workers on their platform [74]. This finding\nrelates to our study as participant's reported Toloka advertising a space of support in the early onboarding period\nand then abandoning them once they used the platform more. Our findings also lead us to argue that the sense of\nisolation experienced by crowdworkers is not necessarily intrinsic to their personal feelings of not wanting to help their\ncommunity, but rather a result of the algorithms optimized by crowdsourcing platforms. Toloka like many crowdsourcing\nplatforms thrive off the workers being online and isolated from each other [26], thus being more alienated. While these\nplatforms offer benefits such as flexible scheduling and autonomy, they may also undermine connections among workers\nto discourage collective organizing. The crowd work economy has been widely discussed by many scholars within HCI\ncommunity. Research spans from critiques on crowd work, to the need to create tools to help crowdworkers. The use\nof digital resistance has been used to help organizers in the online community of crowd work give complaints and\nspeak their minds. The website We are Dynamo was a collective action campaign that gave crowdworkers on Amazon\nMechanical Turk the opportunity to organize against resisting Amazon's exploitative nature of crowd work. [66] This\nsite was deployed in 2011 however has not been monitored and is currently no longer online. This work compares to\nother crowd work tools such as Turkopticon. [33] where this tool allows workers to write reviews on requester on\nAmazon Mechanical Turk, rating them on their communication, fairness, promptness, and generosity. This application\nempowers workers by allowing them to choose tasks before accepting them, addressing issues of dishonest requesters\nthat often result in unfair treatment and pay.\nTo have such growning scholarship dedicated to giving more right to crowdworkers translates to the [75] lack of\nemphasis on community building further reinforces this notion of competition and alienation. Workers, as indicated by\nour findings, want better communication channels for connection, however the platform's design and priorities are\nlikely hindering their requests. In agreement with prior work, our findings support the need for both crowd platforms\nto value worker's desire for community as well as independent platforms to empower workers to communicate about\ntheir labor with one another.

Our research highlights characteristics of digital colonialism, within crowdworker from Latin America\npredominantly comprised middle and lower-class individuals performing tasks for a European-based digital labor\nplatform [59]. For example, while many participants desired connection, we also observed a growing number of\nparticipants voluntarily alienating with one another in the hopes of receiving higher rewards (in other words, giving in\nto the colonial values prioritized by the platform's design). According to social theorist Frantz Fanon [21], individualism\nis a core element of colonialism and must be eradicated in the process of decolonization:\n\\\"The native intellectual had learnt from his masters that the individual ought to express himself fully. The\ncolonialist bourgeoisie had hammered into the native's mind the idea of a society of individuals where each\nperson shuts himself up in his own subjectivity, and whose only wealth is individual thought.\\\" [21]\nConsidering our findings, we can draw a parallel between Fannon's notion of the \\\"native mind\\\" with crowdworkers,\nwhile the bourgeoisie represents the crowd-sourcing platforms. These platforms are intentionally structured to foster\ncompetition and prioritize individual achievement [26], which in turn hinders the willingness of crowdworkers\nto collaborate collectively. When considering the ways in which crowdsourcing markets might embody colonial\nprinciples, it becomes essential to also highlight the six dimensions of power that underlie data colonialism. These\ndimensions encompass the \\\"economy\\\", \\\"political systems\\\", \\\"knowledge production\\\", \\\"personal experiences", "the\nenvironment\\\", and the intricate interplay of \\\"social and technological systems\\\". All of these aspects play a crucial\nrole in understanding the various forms of data extraction and possible colonialism within crowd work. Considering\nthese aspects, it becomes essential to acknowledge that in the context of the crowdsourcing economy, the success\nof platforms relies on the data contributed by workers, as opposed to the requesters": "Data centered economies foster\nextractive models of resource exploitation, the violation of human rights, cultural exclusion, and ecocide. Data extractivism\nassumes that everything is a data source\" [64]. In the context of crowdsourcing, the primary source of data comes from\nthe labor and information provided by workers to requesters [26]. These requesters compensate workers for their\noften time-consuming tasks, sometimes offering minimal payment [60]. Our survey revealed that workers engaged in\ntasks like translation (13%), labeling data (35%), Beta Testing (25%), Survey (25%). A significant portion of their tasks\ninvolved sharing their rich cultural information, which could entail completing surveys or offering their insights for\nbusiness-related objectives.However, when extracting data from these workers, requesters often fail to acknowledge\nthe disproportionately low wages they offer for substantial studies and tasks. Our survey revealed an average daily\ncompensation of less than $10 for the workers' personal information. This data extraction, connects to data colonialism,\nespecially due to the collection and storage of information used to benefit of industry actors located in the global north,\nwith the crowdsourcing companies capitalizing workers cultural knowledge [13, 41]. This lopsided power dynamic\nwarrants thorough investigation, particularly as crowdsourcing continues to expand on a global scale."}, {"title": "5.3 Gender and Crowd Work", "content": "In this section we present our discussion on how gender was affected within crowdwork.

Interestingly, as depicted in Figure 2.C, women crowdworkers used a\nwider variety of tools and online platforms to seek connections compared to men. From this, we argue for the creation of\ndigital tools dedicated to helping Latin American crowdworkers foster online communities. This tool we beleive could\naim in empowering crowdworkers to connect with each other by enabling them to share recommendations, offer advice,\nand collaborate, thereby collectively addressing the prevalent isolation issues encountered in crowd work. Educating\nand informing crowdworkers about these tools is likely also crucial, particularly as Figure 2.C highlights that only a\nsmall number of workers currently employ tools for community building, despite their expressed desire for connection\nbuilding (Fig. 2B).

This configuration represents a typical\nsetup available to individual researchers or small teams, rather than the high-end\nclusters often used for training large language models.\nThe dataset used for fine-tuning is a carefully curated combination of three\nmain sources:\n1. The Bactrian corpus (67,017 entries): Providing a diverse range of Arabic\ntext across various domains.\n2. The Arabic portion of the OpenAssistant dataset (56 entries): Offering ex-\namples of task-oriented language and conversational Arabic.\n3.

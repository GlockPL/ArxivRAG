To facilitate the access for students, a variety of platforms, visual tools, and digital games are already being used to introduce ML concepts and strengthen the understanding of how Al works. We take a look at didactic principles that are employed for teaching computer science, define criteria, and, based on those, evaluate a selection of prominent existing platforms, tools, and games. Additionally, we criticize the approach of portraying ML mostly as a black-box and the resulting missing focus on creating an understanding of data, algorithms, and models that come with it. To tackle this issue, we present a concept that covers intermodal transfer, computational and explanatory thinking, ICE-T, as an extension of known didactic principles. With our multi-faceted concept, we believe that planners of learning units, creators of learning platforms and educators can improve on teaching ML.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Machine Learning (ML) is currently finding its way into more and more curricula due to its increasing significance. Despite the availability of initial materials for classroom instruction, there is still a shortage of suitable resources for effective teaching. In recent years, we have seen new platforms, tools, and games address the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early education (primary school to high school). Studies have demonstrated that digital game-based learning can boost students' motivation and engagement, enrich their cognitive and emotional development, and thereby enhance their learning efficiency [2]. Using digital games for teaching ML offers the advantage that students can learn and experiment in a playful manner. This not only enhances their comprehension of these complex subjects but can also spark their interest in the topic.\nVisual tools are a popular way to teach ML concepts. The variety of representations plays an important role in enhancing the learning experience.

It involves the transfer of learning from one domain to another. In the context of education and cognitive development, intermodal transfer can be observed when individuals successfully apply what they have learned in one mode (e.g., visual, hands-on) to another mode (e.g., symbolic, abstract).\nThe principle of EIS (Enactive, Iconic, Symbolic) by Bruner [4] is a framework used in educational psychology, specifically in the context of learning and"}, {"title": "2.2 Computational Thinking", "content": "Computational thinking is an approach that includes problem-solving and problem formulation aspects based on concepts and methods from computer science [6]. It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, and then using algorithms and logical thinking to devise solutions. Computational thinking is not exclusive to computer scientists; rather, it's a fundamental skill that can be applied across various disciplines and everyday life [17].\nThe principle of UMC, which stands for Use-Modify-Create, is often associated with computational thinking, especially in the context of learning to program, modeling, or working with software [9], making it more suitable for machine learning where models and similar components play a crucial role. In contrast, for example PRIMM [14] places a stronger focus on programming.\nThe UMC principle, shown in figure 2, aligns with the iterative nature of computational thinking. Individuals start by using existing solutions, move on to modifying them based on their needs or understanding, and eventually progress to creating entirely new solutions. This approach fosters a mindset of continuous improvement, adaptability, and creativity in the realm of computational problem-solving.\nUse: When individuals use existing algorithms or code, they are applying computational thinking to understand and leverage the functionalities provided. This can be using a programming library or software application to accomplish a specific task that involves understanding how to apply pre-existing solutions.\nModify: Modifying existing code or algorithms requires a deeper understanding of how they work. This process involves decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking, for example tweaking the parameters of an existing algorithm or adapting a piece of code for a different purpose.\nCreate: Creating original solutions, algorithms, or code is at the core of computational thinking. It involves decomposition to understand the problem, abstraction to focus on essential details, and algorithmic thinking to design a solution. This step is sometimes less strict with regards to the learners creativity and therefore can be more of a Heavily Modify task, which internally combines Create and Modify subtasks.\nIn educational contexts, integrating UMC with computational thinking provides a structured approach for learners to engage with and master the principles of programming and problem-solving using computational concepts."}, {"title": "2.3 Explanatory Thinking", "content": "Explanatory thinking refers to the cognitive process of constructing and providing explanations for various phenomena, events, or concepts. It involves the ability to analyze information, identify patterns, and articulate coherent and meaningful explanations for why something happens or how it works. Explanatory thinking is a crucial aspect of critical thinking and problem-solving, allowing individuals to make sense of the world around them and communicate their understanding effectively. In the context of AI/ML, this would mean following a process of learning how to understand the task, working with the data and"}, {"title": "2.4 Related Tools & Games", "content": "Wangenheim et al. [16] compiled visual tools for teaching ML in the K-12 education sector and identified three key aspects of visual tools for teaching ML in K-12 education. First, they emphasize \"learning by doing\" through hands-on activities and model development. Second, they are based on constructivism and constructionism, promoting active knowledge construction and artifact creation. Third, they highlight the importance of adapting tools to local contexts to motivate students with relevant and interesting problems.\nExploring the use of concepts in education, Marques et al. [10] examined 30 instructional units (courses, workshops, activities, etc.) primarily used in high schools in their work. They emphasized that, given the complexity of ML concepts, several units cover only the most accessible processes. For example, some units only teach data management, present model learning and testing at an abstract level, and hide some of the underlying ML processes.\nIn [1], Alam found that digital games could improve programming and computational thinking skills. They improve problem-solving through complex puzzles, introduce algorithmic thinking with rule-based gameplay, and require logical and strategic thinking. Additionally, these games foster creativity by allowing players to design elements. A critical aspect is the immediate feedback provided by the games, which supports iterative problem-solving, a fundamental component of computational thinking."}, {"title": "3 Methodology & Results", "content": "In this section, we present and examine existing tools, platforms and digital games according to evaluation criteria based on the aforementioned didactic facets.

Other applications have been highlighted by Schroer et al. in [12].\nDue to its better flexibility and universality [3] compared to other process models (e.g. SEMMA, KDD), the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining [19] appears to be most suited for adaptation into an educational context. This process model for Data Mining or Data Science tasks is widely used in industry. Figure 3 shows the six phases of the process:\n1. Business Understanding focuses on the requirements and objectives of a use case, which are then converted into a Data Mining (or Data Science) problem.\n2. Data Understanding describes a phase that consists of acquiring initial data and understanding its characteristics. From this, the goal is to identify potential issues and challenges.\n3. Data Preparation covers the construction of the data set that will be used in the modeling phase. In this phase it can be necessary to remove, clean, engineer or transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis.\n4. Modeling means selecting modeling techniques and algorithms and then building predictive or descriptive models based on the prepared data.\n5. Evaluation is usually done during, and after the training process. Here, the models' quality gets measured and compared to the criteria set during the business understanding phase.\n6. Deployment is the final step to integrate the Machine Learning model into an operational environment, as an application."}, {"title": "3.3 RQ3: How can the presented didactic principles be combined\nand applied?", "content": "We finally present our own learning concept, called ICE-T, which combines the principles of Intermodal Transfer, Computational Thinking and Explanatory Thinking, and which is illustrated in figure 5. We argue that in order to fully understand and use ML methods, it is necessary to cover all of these areas when designing learning units for school curricula, learning platforms, etc. To support our claim, we will refer to figure 6 and provide an example:\nWe consider the situation in which an educator plans to teach how to use Decision Trees [18] as a classifier for animals (1:). In this example, the data consists of a set of the animals Lion, Shark, Eagle, Penguin, each with information about their attributes (Has feathers?, Can fly?, Eats meat?, Has fins?). The task (\"Classify different animal species by asking as few questions about their characteristics as possible\") is presented in a problem-centered manner, where students should discuss ideas to come up with solutions - independent of the algorithm that will be taught. To understand the data, learners first examine tables of animals and their characteristics (2: Iconic + Use). Students can also do some of the preparation by expanding to the table and adjusting the data (3: Iconic + Modify). To promote a deeper understanding, they can visualize the data in different ways, e.g., by plotting (4: Enactive, Iconic + Use).\nTo understand the model, it can be helpful to first play a \"question-answer\" game, in which players can decide the order in which the questions will be"}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "We examined didactic principles that get employed for teaching computer science and maths, defined didactic criteria and, based on those, evaluated a selection of existing platforms, tools and games.

This reliance, coupled with models' tendency to generalize based on statistical maximal likelihood, can propagate and amplify biases, exacerbating societal issues. To address this, our study proposes a reflective methodology utilizing multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) engaged in a dynamic dialogue to uncover diverse perspectives.

Furthermore, it enables measurable progress tracking and explainable remediation actions to address identified biases.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "AI systems are increasingly being integrated into critical sectors such as education, healthcare, and public policy, where their decisions can have profound impacts. Despite their potential, these systems are prone to exhibit discriminatory behaviors, propagate existing biases, or make errors. Researchers in machine learning are diligently addressing these challenges by investigating the sources, patterns, and types of biases inherent in AI systems (Mehrabi et al., 2021). While achieving absolute fairness is complicated by diverse cultural, religious, and ideological perspectives, the primary objective remains to minimize the propagation of biases within machine learning models (Kleinberg et al., 2017; Mehrabi et al., 2021; Selbst et al., 2019; Gautam and Srinath, 2024; Baeza-Yates, 2018). In this data-centric era, the accuracy of training data, especially the ground-truth labels, is crucial. Machine learning algorithms are designed not to alter the data but to accurately reflect any biases present in the labels. Incorrect labels, such as a biased news article marked as neutral or a wrong medical diagnosis, can mislead models, resulting in harmful outcomes. Consequently, our research focuses on identifying and correcting mislabeled data to effectively mitigate bias and ensure the responsible application of AI.\nEvidence of annotation biases is illustrated in Section 4. Tables 1 and 2 present real data (Budak et al., 2016) showing how annotators' political affiliations can influence their labeling of news articles. For instance, annotators aligned with the Democratic party are more inclined to perceive scandals involving Democrats negatively, whereas Republican annotators might view the same incidents neutrally. Conversely, Republican annotators might downplay criticisms directed at their party, whereas Democrats might view them as justified, underscoring the influence of personal ideologies on annotation practices.\nTo counter the perpetuation of these biases through classifiers, we propose a check-and-balance framework wherein two Large Language Models (LLMs) engage in dialogue to scrutinize and challenge human annotations. One LLM supports the original annotation while the other introduces alternative perspectives, thereby enriching the understanding of the content. This dialogue is structured to foster a productive exchange that cultivates balanced insights into the discussed topics and makes recommendations to the editorial board if concerns arise.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this dialogue, we employ several metrics grounded in statistical and information theory principles. Measures such as Shannon entropy (Shannon, 1948) and mutual information (Cover and Thomas, 2006) assess enhancements in shared understanding, while metrics like Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) (Lin, 1991), Wasserstein distance (WD) (Kantorovich, 1942), and cross-entropy (CE) (Shore and Johnson, 1980)"}, {"title": "", "content": "track the productivity of the dialogue. The process is transparent, allowing human supervisors to review and adjust annotations based on the dialogue outcomes, thus ensuring recommendations are rigorously examined. Our empirical studies confirm the efficacy of this approach.\nThe contributions of this paper are threefold: 1. Enhanced Ground Truth Validation: We leverage structured dialogues among multiple LLMs to refine and cross-verify ground-truth labels, providing a robust mechanism to mitigate biases inherent in traditional training datasets. This approach enhances the reliability of data annotations and introduces an interpretable strategy for bias mitigation.\n2. Systematic Bias Reduction: Through contentious and collaborative debates, our framework actively uncovers and addresses biases within the labels, thereby promoting the creation of more neutral annotations that consider comprehensive perspectives.\n3. Diversity, Quality, and Divergence Metrics: Using metrics rooted in statistical and information theory, we quantitatively measure the diversity of perspectives (Shannon entropy), the quality of information exchange (mutual information), and the progress and convergence of the dialogue (JSD, WD, and CE), enhancing the integrity and neutrality of annotations.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses challenges and reviews related work; Section 3 describes the core maxims, theorem, and algorithm; Section 4 presents experiments illustrating successful bias identification and mitigation; and the final section concludes with insights on future work and perceived limitations."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "This study focuses on mitigating training data label (ground truth) bias, a primary concern in machine learning (Mehrabi et al., 2021). Accurate labeling is crucial, as a label that aligns with biased content reinforces that bias, while a label that correctly identifies it allows for education and correction (Baeza-Yates, 2018; Danks and London, 2017). This underscores the importance of label accuracy in minimizing bias propagation.\nThis work specifically addresses mislabeled ground truth and explores remediation actions. Efforts to improve annotation accuracy can be broadly categorized into three approaches:\nCross-Validation with Multiple Annotators: Ensemble methods, utilizing multiple annotators and statistical techniques, can mitigate individual biases and enhance data reliability (Snow et al., 2008). This approach has been successful in tasks with broad consensus, such as image annotation with ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009; Krizhevsky et al., 2012). However, it may be less effective for complex or biased content, where subtle interpretations are required. For instance, the term \u201cdiscovered\" in reference to Columbus's arrival in the Americas reflects a Western bias, while \u201cencounter\" offers a more accurate representation from Indigenous perspectives (Wikipedia, 2023; Mostafazadeh Davani et al., 2022). Relying on majority votes in such cases can be counterproductive, and while diverse annotator pools are important, the inherent limitations of human annotation, including the assumption of a single truth, must be acknowledged (Aroyo and Welty, 2015).\nCross-Validation between Machine and Human Annotators: Integrating machine learning algorithms into the annotation process can improve quality by leveraging both human expertise and machine efficiency (Wang et al., 2021). Semi-supervised learning, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data, is one such technique (Ratner et al., 2017). However, machine learning algorithms can be inherently biased due to their training data, and ensemble methods may not fully resolve these underlying biases (Wang et al., 2021; Baeza-Yates, 2018).\nGAI Opportunity: The emergence of GAI and LLMs, with their vast knowledge base and powerful Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), presents a new avenue for addressing annotation bias. LLMs can potentially uncover diverse perspectives on a given topic, including historical shifts and evolving narratives. Recent studies have explored combining LLM output with human feedback for annotation tasks (Tan et al., 2024).\nHowever, due to their \u201cmaximal likelihood\" next-token prediction training objective, LLMs may prioritize popular viewpoints over minority ones. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a novel approach, grounded in statistical and information theories, that aims to uncover and balance diverse viewpoints, ensuring that both majority and minority perspectives are adequately represented in the annotation process."}, {"title": "EVINCE Algorithm", "content": "Expanding on our prior work (Chang, 2023a, 2024) with theoretical foundations and quantitative metrics, EVINCE (Entropy and Variation IN Conditional Exchanges) leverages LLMs to promote content neutrality through the incorporation of diverse perspectives.\nEVINCE facilitates structured dialogues between LLMs to address the \"maximal likelihood\" bias inherent in conventional information retrieval systems. This bias manifests in search engines like Google, where popular viewpoints are often prioritized based on metrics like click-through rates (Adams-Hands, 2023), potentially sidelining less common perspectives. Similarly, LLM text generation, which relies on predicting the next most likely token, can inadvertently amplify existing biases present in the training data (Li et al., 2023).\nTo foster divergent perspectives, EVINCE addresses two sub-goals:\n\u2022 Exploration: Encouraging the generation of a wide array of viewpoints.\n\u2022 Meaningful Diversity: Ensuring collected perspectives are substantive and not merely contrarian for the sake of disagreement.\nEVINCE achieves these goals by analyzing probability distributions of top-k labels elicited from each LLM in the committee. Through this analysis, individual entropies, cross-entropy between distributions, and mutual information are computed. (For detailed metrics and formulas, refer to Appendix A.) Based on this quantitative assessment, EVINCE dynamically adjusts its linguistic behaviors (e.g, more contentious vs. more conciliatory) to optimize the annotation recommendations.\nThe initial phase of the EVINCE algorithm aims to induce dual entropy and high cross-entropy between the LLM-generated distributions. I will prove shortly that dual entropy is the ideal condition to foster information exchange between LLMs. This signifies disagreement and creates a fertile ground for novel perspective discovery and exchange. Through iterative dialogue, mutual information increases while divergence decreases, ultimately converging towards a consensus."}, {"title": "Maxims and Optimal Theorem", "content": "Maxim 1: Orchestrate Two Equally Competent LLMs in Structured Debate: Integrating two equally competent LLMs ensures a balanced exchange of insights and avoids bias from knowledge asymmetry. This adversarial setup fosters diversity in predictions, each supported by justifications, promoting critical evaluation and uncovering potential blind spots. The concern is not about the potential non-overlapping training data, as information exchange can remedy this. Instead, the focus is on ensuring that both models have similar quality, primarily determined by their size, to prevent one model from dominating the other due to a disparity in reasoning quality.\nMaxim 2: Encourage the Accurate Rather Than the \"Popular\" Prediction: Typically, LLMs, with their maximum likelihood next-token prediction objective, tend to favor the most popular predictions. By conditioning LLMs within specific contexts, we can prioritize accuracy over popularity, thus mitigating confirmation biases.\nMaxim 3: Combine Predictions Weighted by Diversity and Quality: Weighting the probability distributions from two LLMs based on diverse probabilistic insights and the quality of supporting arguments.\nHow? Following these three sub-maxims:\n\u2022 Maxim 3.1: Prediction Reliability: Estimate the reliability of predictions using entropy-based measures to quantify uncertainty and information content. Typically, lower entropy indicates higher confidence in a prediction, suggesting higher reliability.\n\u2022 Maxim 3.2: Argument Quality: Evaluate the quality of supporting arguments using techniques inspired by the Socratic method. This includes identifying logical fallacies and assessing the relevance and credibility of evidence.\n\u2022 Maxim 3.3: Aggregation: Employ a weighted aggregation method, such as a Bayesian model, to combine weighted predictions accounting for both probabilistic insights and the quality of supporting arguments.\nMaxim 4: Evaluating the Convergence Rate of the Predictions Across the Rounds: This maxim focuses on measuring how quickly and effectively the predictions from the LLMs converge over successive rounds, assessing the efficiency of the debate and aggregation mechanisms. Convergence is assessed by measuring mutual information and using proxy metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cross entropy. When mutual information is low or the similarity between predictions is high, the dialogue is considered to be converging."}, {"title": "Algorithm Specifications", "content": "With all proxy metrics and their pros, cons, and combined strengths comprehensively surveyed (Appendix A), Algorithm 1 formally specifies the algorithm of EVINCE with the maxims."}, {"title": "Entropy Duality Theorem (EDT)", "content": "Theorem EDT: Optimal Pairing of LLMs for Probabilistic Prediction Accuracy. The optimal pairing of LLMs for diagnosis accuracy, in terms of stability, accuracy, and robustness, occurs when the LLMs are 1) equivalent in the quality of the information they process, and 2) exhibit contrasting entropy values in their prediction distributions-one high and one low.\n[Proof]: Given two LLMs, LLMA and LLMB, following Maxim #1 with prediction distributions $P_A$ and $P_B$, respectively. The information entropy of LLMA, $H(P_A)$, is high, and of LLMB, $H(P_B)$, is low. The proof proceeds:\nStep 1: Define combined prediction distribution. Let the combined prediction distribution of LLMA and LLMB be denoted as $P_C$. We can express $P_C$ as a weighted average of $P_A$ and $P_B$:\n$P_C = \\alpha P_A + (1 - \\alpha) P_B$, where $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$.\nStep 2: Express the information entropy of the combined prediction distribution. Using the definition of information entropy, we calculate:\n$H(P_C) = - \\sum_i P_C(x_i) \\log_2 P_C(x_i) = - \\sum_i [\\alpha P_A(x_i) +(1-\\alpha)P_B(x_i)] \\log_2[\\alpha P_A(x_i) + (1 - \\alpha)P_B(x_i)]$.\nStep 3: Apply Jensen's Inequality to the information entropy of the combined prediction distribution. Jensen's inequality is applied to the convex function $f(x) = -x \\log_2 x$. For a convex function and a set of probabilities $p_i$, Jensen's inequality states that:\n$f(\\sum p_i x_i) \\leq \\sum p_i f(x_i)$.\nThus, the entropy of the combined distribution is:\n$H(P_C) \\geq \\alpha H(P_A) + (1 - \\alpha) H(P_B)$\nwhere equality holds when $P_A = P_B$.\nStep 4: Analyze the lower bound of the combined information entropy. As $H(P_A)$ is high and $H(P_B)$ is low, their relationship is:\n$H(P_A) = H(P_B) + \\Delta$, where $\\Delta > 0$."}, {"title": "", "content": "Substituting into the inequality from Step 3 yields:\n$H(P_C) \\geq \\alpha [H(P_B) + \\Delta] + (1-\\alpha)H(P_B) = H(P_B) + \\Delta$.\nStep 5: Interpret the lower bound of the combined information entropy. The lower bound of $H(P_C)$, and hence the robustness of the model, is maximized when $\\alpha$ is maximized, which corresponds to giving more weight to the high-entropy model (LLMA). This setup facilitates the exploration of diverse possibilities and enhances robustness against noise and perturbations in the input data, while still ensuring that predictions are grounded by the more certain outcomes predicted by the low-entropy model (LLMB).\nStep 6: Conclude the proof. By combining the prediction distributions of LLMA and LLMB, with one having high information entropy and the other low, we achieve an optimal balance that maximizes the lower bound of the combined information entropy. This balance between exploration (high entropy) and exploitation (low entropy) optimizes overall prediction accuracy and robustness, as proved through information theory and the properties of entropy. Thus, the theorem is established."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Our experimental framework aims to assess the feasibility of both detecting biases in textual content and implementing effective mitigation strategies.

First, it is crucial to investigate whether the adversarial behavior exhibited by LLMs is genuine or artificially constructed based on their training data.

Assessing these metrics thoroughly will help identify and address their limitations, ensuring they provide reliable and meaningful insights into the dynamics of multi-LLM debates.\nThird, the cost of supporting multi-LLM, multi-round dialogue increases about tenfold. Ideally, the framework should be integrated into an LLM to conduct internal cross-validation before generating output, reducing the need for external multi-round communication. We have been investigating the use of a lightweight, independent guardrail-LLM to provide ethical advice and mitigate this cost issue. However, this approach must be carefully implemented to avoid introducing catastrophic forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Rusu et al., 2016), where the integration of new knowledge or parameters can lead to the loss of previously learned information in the knowledge-LLMs.\nWhile we believe our work is among the earliest proposals for multi-LLM debate frameworks (July 2023), providing definitive evidence is challenging due to anonymity policies on platforms like arXiv and the difficulty of identifying all subsequent work that may have been influenced by our ideas.

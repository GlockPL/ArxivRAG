While their utility is widely recognized, challenges persist in their automation and completeness. Despite efforts in automation and the utilization of expert-created ontologies, gaps in connectivity remain prevalent within KGs. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative approach termed \"Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA)\u201d.

Introduction", "content": "While once considered a relic of early Artificial Intelligence (AI) research Smolensky (1987), knowledge graphs (KGs) have experienced a remarkable resurgence in recent years. Knowledge graphs, which serve as the foundation of symbolic AI, consist of interconnected knowledge pertaining to many domains like medical, finance, commerce, and education Zou (2020). Particularly in medicine, KGs have emerged as indispensable tool.\nKGs offer numerous advantages over traditional relational databases, primarily stemming from their diverse array of nodes and the ability to establish connections between them. This versatility lends itself to applications ranging from search engine optimization to recommendation systems, knowledge discovery, and research facilitation. However, the process of constructing KGs is inherently labor-intensive, especially in the intricate domain of medicine, despite its profound significance.\nA KG is essentially a multi-graph, characterized by its directed, labeled, and diverse nature. At its core, a KG comprises facts, often represented as triplets Hogan et al. (2021), each consisting of a relationship and two nodes. With KGs consisting of millions to billions of these triplets, their aggregation holds immense potential for information discovery, data integration, and effective management. Yet, crafting KGs, particularly within the medical domain, presents formidable challenges due to the complexity of medical concepts and relationships between them. Compounding these challenges is the prevalence of unstructured medical data, further complicating the KG creation process.\nVarious methodologies for graph creation have emerged in recent years, ranging from automatic to semi-automated and manual approaches Hao et al. (2021). While these methods addresses some challenges. However they often suffer from significant deficiencies such as they lack standardized platforms or code for graph creation despite offering graphical methodologies. Furthermore, some approaches utilize hospital notes to generate nodes and relations, they overlook the potential benefits of data augmentation, resulting in incomplete graphs. Additionally, there is currently no promising technology capable of generating graphs in real-time, further impeding the process.\nIn response to these challenges, our proposed approach, Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA), effectively addresses these obstacles by seamlessly processing both structured and unstructured data in real-time. The preprocessing steps involve Named En-"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Over the past few years, a number of knowledge graph automation techniques have emerged in every aspect of life, including business, healthcare, finance, and education. Most of them were proposed with particular use cases and problems in mind. Given its diversity, volume, velocity, and truthfulness, the KG creation in the healthcare industry is far more challenging than in other industries. Furthermore, KG completion approaches are seldom"}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "Our proposed approach is designed in mutiple steps. Figure 2 illustrates the entire workflow of the Medical-Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA). This approach acquire data in two formats: structured and unstructured. It then applies various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process the data. Initially, Bioportal is utilized to identify and enhance medical concepts with semantic information. The fetched data is filtered and used to create nodes in a knowledge graph (KG) along with their relationships. A pre-trained contextual word embedding model Clinical BERT is leaveraged to discover hidden connections for KG completion. Finally, a Cypher query file is generated to facilitate the creation of the KG in Neo4j. The details of each individual stage are outlined below."}, {"title": "3.1. User Input", "content": "The M-KGA technique allows users to input medical data in two distinct formats: structured and unstructured. When we say \"structured,\" we mean that the user defines the medical terms with precision. The data does not contain any interconnected notions. Here is an example of a text that is organized in a structured manner:\nStructured Input Example:\n[\u2018fever', \u2018diarrhea\u2019, \u2018insomnia', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome\u201d, \u2018diabetes']\nUnstructured text, on the other hand, is free natural language text that is understand- able to people but not to computers. This is the text written by a medical professional for instance diagnosis of a patient. An illustration of an unstructured text is:\nUnstructured Input Example:\n[\"If you have a condition called polyuria, it's because your body makes more pee than normal. Adults usually make about 3 liters of urine per day. But with polyuria, you could make up to 15 liters per day. It's a classic sign of diabetes.\"]\nThe developed code can take data in both formats; if structured text is needed, it will ask for the data numerous times. If unstructured formatted text is needed, it will accept it all at once and find out the concepts on its own."}, {"title": "3.2. NLP-based Knowledge Filtration", "content": "We have introduced two approaches for NLP based knowledge filtration consisting of i) NER-based keyword extraction and ii) knowledge filtration. The NER-based keyword extraction attempts to identify medical concepts from unstructured text in the first place, and transform into structure format. Subsequently the Key Knowledge Filtration process is employed to filter the most prominent information obtained from the previous step. Each process is comprehensively presented below:"}, {"title": "3.2.1. NER-BASED KEYWORD EXTRACTION:", "content": "An unstructured document is provided as input to extract a list of clinical entities employ- ing NER-based keyword function. This process is integral for populating the nodes of the medical knowledge graph, enabling the incorporation of diverse medical entities such as diseases, treatments, and other clinical concepts. We have leveraged the SciSpacy library Alsentzer et al. (2019), a specialized extension of the popular spaCy natural language pro- cessing framework tailored for scientific and biomedical text. Specifically, the function loads the en_core_sci_sm model, which is optimized for processing biomedical text.\nThe NER-based Keyword Extraction function requires the unstructured clinical text as input, as a result clinical concept would be extracted as an output. Further, this approach then leverages the biomedical model to process the text and extract clinical entities, return- ing a list that can be seamlessly integrated into the evolving medical knowledge graph."}, {"title": "3.2.2. KNOWLEDGE FILTRATION:", "content": "Subsequently, acquiring a list of clinical or medical concepts, knowledge filtration function would be applied to choose only relevant and prominent concepts. The concepts that are previously extracted may contain some redundancies. Knowledge Filtration looks for duplicates in the data by Fuzzy-matching and filters it further. Additionally, the knowledge filtration assists the medical practice in decision making towards building a comprehensive KG by including and excluding certain concepts. The concept that is extracted during the NER-based keyword extraction process may be not relevant to current problem, disease diagnosis or treatment. By mapping these words to Bioportal Ontologies, more filtering is applied."}, {"title": "3.3. Semantic Information Extraction", "content": "The organized, enhanced, and sifted material from the preceding stage is used in the se- mantic information extraction step. Mapping these terms to expert-created Bioportal on- tologies Noy et al. (2009) allows you to retrieve the semantically enriched information using the Bioportal REST API. Our approach's strength is rooted in the notion that M-KGA is not exclusive to any particular medical condition or illness. Instead, it attempts to enrich data without being limited to particular ontologies.\nDifferent sorts of semantically enriched information are retrieved from ontologies. Syn- onyms are words, phrases, or morphemes that share the same meaning as the term being mapped. Definition: A group of terms or phrases that provide a longer description of the term that is mapped. In this process, the two types of extraction took place this is presented below."}, {"title": "3.3.1. SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE FILTRATION", "content": "Since our method is not limited to a specific medical condition or issue, M-KGA anticipates a high degree of data diversity, variation, and redundancy. In this step, data that has been semantically enhanced is filtered using a variety of techniques. The method attempts to translate data from many languages to English, eliminate duplicates from the retrieved data, and then use fuzzy-matching to further filter the findings."}, {"title": "3.3.2. TRANSLATION:", "content": "The data used in the enrichment stage is multilingual and comes from many ontologies. To translate this material, libraries were explored. We need to take this action since, in the absence of translation, we will lose some important information. Text that we identified as non-English was translated into English; if the language cannot be identified or there are any exceptions, the text is eliminated. The subsequent stage does not include this deleted portion. Since the non-English text cannot be used in any further steps, it has been removed. Pre-trained model employed to find hidden connections are unable to comprehend the data, which will result in problems. Aside from that, this step will address the limitations imposed by Neo4j on the creation of a Cypher Node ID."}, {"title": "3.3.3. DUPLICATE REMOVAL:", "content": "This step takes the enriched data from the previous stage and tries to remove the duplicates. As we are fetching data from 1000+ Bioportal ontologies, we will likely data massive dupli- cations. In this step we used semantic information, changed all synonyms and definitions to lower case and then used simple set operation on python to remove redundant entries."}, {"title": "3.3.4. FUZZY MATCHING:", "content": "An expansion of the duplicate removal process is fuzzy matching. Certain enriched data may contain semantically comparable text that cannot be removed with set procedures. In an effort to maintain the content's uniqueness, we employed this strategy. This also fixes problems in the ID creation stage and greatly aids in the removal of semantically duplicate items."}, {"title": "3.4. Knowledge Graph Creation", "content": "Creating a KG is a challenging endeavor in and of itself because it requires extreme caution while creating nodes and interactions. The KG was developed in Neo4j's Cypher query language. The format has unique limitations. The node ID in Cypher ought to begin with a character rather than a number, special character, non-English phrase, etc. Taking these factors into account, we produced graphs. This will be further explained in the steps following."}, {"title": "3.4.1. NODE ID CREATION:", "content": "Nodes ID was developed with the understanding that hundreds of connections\u2014both hidden and provided by the ontology-must be made between nodes. We translated the Node content or enriched data into ID by adhering to the ID requirements for different KG formats in order to reduce the amount of computing resources required for ID retrieval for comparison and connection formation. As previously stated, the Node ID in Cpyher only accepts data in English format; special characters are not permitted, etc. Using this method, the enriched data on polyuria is transformed into IDs such as \"excessivesecretionofurine,\" from the definition of \"excessive secretion of urine.\" Therefore, we don't have to go look for the ID connected to that Node every time we need to establish a connection. All we had to do was apply our function and turn the content into ID."}, {"title": "3.4.2. NODE CREATION:", "content": "This step builds the nodes for the structured and unstructured (converted to structured) data, as well as the semantically enriched data, according to the ID creation technique pre- viously outlined. Different kinds of nodes have been created. Synonyms, medical concepts, definitions and so on are among the categories. Depending on its kind, every node in the graph is represented by a distinct color. The node displays the content. All KG nodes are constructed in this step."}, {"title": "3.4.3. RELATIONSHIP/CONNECTION CREATION:", "content": "This step connects different nodes based on the expert-provided/ ontology-provided connec- tions. With each iteration, a semantically enriched node is created with ID, the connection creation step, uses the ID and connects the node with the main medical concept. Same is the case for all semantically enriched data. Here, relationships are also of different types such as synonyms, definitions, and so on. Relationships are labeled and directed."}, {"title": "3.5. Hidden connection Extraction", "content": "The earlier processes collect user data, filter it, obtain enriched data from ontologies pro- duced by experts, and produce a knowledge graph. In addition to the links supplied by experts, our method looks for hidden connections absent from ontologies. The ontologies offer richer medical terminology, but it might be challenging to determine whether or not these concepts are related to one another. Exist any connections that could be omitted to improve the analysis of the medical data? We made knowledge graphs, but how do we complete them?\nTo address these problems, we attempted using KG embeddings for our method, which can predict links given KG triplets. Sadly, these methods are ineffective for tiny graphs. Our method can create both large and tiny KG in response to user requests; nevertheless, KG embeddings are unable to function on small networks because these models need thousands of triplets. Therefore, in order to create connections, we took advantage of word embeddings to determine a word's meaning and relationships with other words. It should be highlighted that our method looks for connections with other medical concepts and their enriched content rather than trying to establish links with its semantic enriched nodes, which are all already connected."}, {"title": "3.5.1. CLINICAL BERT EMBEDDINGS:", "content": "We took advantage of Clinical BERT embeddings to extract vector representation of medical concepts and their contextual meta-data. We utilized the Clinical BERT embeddings, which are trained on a sizable medical corpus, in place of creating our own model. Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) is used to train the model. We took use of their pretrained nature and open-source nature to comprehend medical concepts and their interrelationships. We calculated the degree of similarity between various terms and built relations that led to knowledge graph completion based on the distance and user-defined threshold."}, {"title": "3.5.2. CLUSTER-BASED COMPARISON:", "content": "We offered two methods for locating the links that are buried in knowledge graphs. We treated every medical concept and its semantically enriched data as a cluster in a cluster- based method. Using all available semantic information, we composed a paragraph and then used the Clinical BERT model to look for embeddings. Clinical BERT implementa- tion is not scalable and introduces mistakes on big clusters. In order to address this method, we segmented the paragraph into chunks, handled exceptions, fetched embeddings for each chunk and then divided by the total number of pieces. A cluster is mapped with other clusters according to a user-defined threshold. The threshold and the degree to which users require specific or general connections are key factors here. In actuality, the threshold is the separation between the clusters. To determine whether clusters have strong relationships or not, users can choose the lower threshold. Cluster-based comparisons or connections lead to KG completion quickly and at low computing cost. This step introduces further relation- ships named 'embedding_match_cluster' in the KG."}, {"title": "3.5.3. NODE-BASED COMPARISON:", "content": "In contrast to the cluster-based approach, the node-based technique looks for connections with other nodes in the cluster. Using word embeddings, this compares a single node to every other cluster's node based on nodes. The lack of a large amount of text on the nodes means that scalability is not an issue. Furthermore, this method requires around n2 time and is computationally costly, as opposed to the cluster-based method. Because the node- based technique allows us to determine the exact match of the link, it is much easier to understand. Here, connections are also established according to user-specified thresholds."}, {"title": "3.6. Use case Testing", "content": "To determine the efficacy of our method, we ran three separate use cases through it. Three use cases were selected: medical claims, medical diagnostics, and medical coding. We used the Spanish dataset known as \"CodiEsp\" [8] to test each of these use cases. Experts annotate CodiEsp data with ICD-10 codes. To test our strategy, we used the discharge summaries along with their annotations."}, {"title": "3.6.1. MEDICAL CODING AND CLAIM VERIFICATION:", "content": "We used several synopses, medical terms, and related medical codes. We extracted the medical terms contained in the descriptions of the medical codes after converting them into descriptions. We then used our Medical-Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA) technique to see the outcomes after passing all the medical concepts\u2014such as discharge summaries or descriptions of diagnostic codes\u2014through it. True positive and true negative cases were used in our tests. We took the summaries, applied our method to their annotations, annotated the summaries once again with fictitious examples, and retested the method. The approach demonstrated its usefulness through visualization and proved satisfactory in all cases. We also experimented with various thresholds."}, {"title": "3.6.2. MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS:", "content": "We also tested the method for medical diagnosis using CodiEsp data. Each medical sum- mary's knowledge graph was made using the concepts that were extracted from the sum- maries using the NER-based keyword extraction stage. We applied both node-based and cluster-based comparisons, and we generated a complete KG. We presume that any medical ideas included in a summary must be related to one another; this relationship will confirm the usefulness of our method for completing graphs and offer a far more profound compre- hension of the relationships taken from ontologies. Using our node-based and cluster-based comparisons technique, the strategy demonstrated significance in all experiments and most medical terms within the same summary generated links. To better understand the ap- proach's operation, we also put it to the test with negative cases as well."}, {"title": "4. Evaluation", "content": "In this section, we present the results obtained from the implementation and testing of our proposed Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA) approach. The evaluation aims to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of M-KGA in constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs from medical concepts provided by users. We conducted experiments using a diverse set of 100 medical concepts to evaluate the performance of our approach across various domains within healthcare.\nIn our evaluation, we partitioned the 100 medical concepts into two sets: 50 for assessing the cluster-based comparison method and another 50 for evaluating the node-based com- parison approach. Each set underwent pairing, facilitated by the GPT-3.5 model, to create pairs of medical concepts. These pairs were compiled into an Excel file for annotation by human medical experts. The experts were tasked with annotating each pair based on mea- sures of True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN), providing valuable insights into the accuracy and performance of our approach.\nFollowing the annotation process, we applied both the cluster-based and node-based comparison methods to the pairs of medical concepts with threshold=4. Utilizing these methods, we constructed knowledge graphs for each pair and analyzed whether they suc- cessfully identified connections as annotated by the experts. Given that traditional ontolo- gies often struggle to find connections among certain medical concepts, our objective was to determine if our approach could uncover hidden connections that might otherwise remain undiscovered. This analysis aimed to ascertain the efficacy of our proposed methods in augmenting existing knowledge and revealing previously unrecognized relationships within the medical domain.\nIn Figure 5, the metrics constructed using True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN), and False Negative (FN) are presented. Our analysis focused on evaluating accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision based on these metrics. The comparison depicted in the figure highlights the performance disparity between the node-based and cluster-based methods. Notably, the node-based method emerges as the clear frontrunner, exhibiting significantly higher accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision compared to the cluster-based approach. This observation underscores the effectiveness of the node-based method in accurately capturing connections within the knowledge graph, ultimately leading to superior performance across all evaluated metrics."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "In conclusion, this study introduces the Medical Knowledge Graph Automation (M-KGA) approach, which aims to address the challenges associated with automating the construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) and enhancing their completeness. Leveraging user-provided medical concepts and BioPortal ontologies, M-KGA enriches the semantic content of KGs using pre-trained embeddings, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive representation of structured medical knowledge. Our approach incorporates two distinct methodologies, namely a cluster-based approach and a node-based approach, to uncover hidden connections within the knowledge graph.\nThrough rigorous testing involving 100 medical concepts, our M-KGA framework demon- strates promising results, showcasing its potential to overcome the limitations of existing knowledge graph automation techniques. The performance metrics and graph visualiza- tions presented in this study underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the transparency and accuracy of knowledge graphs, particularly in the medical domain.\nLooking ahead, future work will focus on addressing scalability issues associated with the cluster-based method, aiming to improve its performance. Additionally, we plan to explore retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), for knowledge graph development and performance comparison with our current approach. By continuing to innovate and refine our approach, we aim to further advance the field of knowledge graph automation and contribute to the development of more comprehensive and accurate representations of structured knowledge in healthcare domain."}]}

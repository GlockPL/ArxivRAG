{"title": "Five questions and answers about artificial intelligence", "authors": ["Alberto Prieto", "Beatriz Prieto"], "abstract": "Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are\ngenerating much controversy in society, often without scientific\nbasis. As occurred the development of other emerging technologies,\nsuch as the introduction of electricity in the early 20th century, AI\ncauses both fascination and fear. Following the advice of the\nphilosopher R.W. Emerson's advice 'the knowledge is the antidote\nto fear', this paper seeks to contribute to the dissemination of\nknowledge about AI. To this end, it reflects on the following\nquestions: the origins of AI, its possible future evolution, its ability\nto show feelings, the associated threats and dangers, and the\nconcept of Al singularity", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Many researchers consider that since the end of the 18th century we\nhave experienced several industrial revolutions [15]. The first, brought\nabout by the invention of the steam engine, led to the development of\nthe textile and metal industries. The second, known as the\nTechnological Revolution, involved the advancement of the steel and oil\nindustries, as well as the advent of electricity. The third is the Digital\nRevolution, which brought about the popularisation of computing and\nICTs in general, with the introduction of personal computers and the\nInternet.\n\nThe concept of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR) was coined during\nthe World Economic Forum (Davos Forum) in 2016 [16, 10, 21]. This\nexpression refers to the ubiquity of technology, allowing ICT systems\nand devices to be available everywhere, accessible from anywhere and\nat any time. This latest revolution involves the full development of Data\nScience, Nanotechnology, Robotics, mobile ICT devices, the Internet of"}, {"title": "Can Artificial Intelligence have feelings?", "content": "In our relationship with other people, machines and elements in our\nenvironment, what really matters is what and how we perceive those\nsensations. We can judge and categorise people (friendly, unkind,\nimmoral, etc.) but in practice, it is the particular interactions with them\nthat concern us. Thus, we say that a person is empathic when he/she\nis able to identify with someone and share their feelings. This is a\nconclusion we draw from their behaviour, irrespective of the nature or\nessence of that individual.\n\nFrom this point of view, it can be said that a machine can appear to\nhave feelings if, in its interactions with people, we perceive attitudes\nsimilar to those of humans. Indeed, we can appropriately programme\nmachines to behave as if they have feelings or emotions, in the sense\nthat, in concrete situations, they emulate phenomena such as joy,\naffection, humour, love, happiness, fear, anxiety, anger, sadness,\nanger, rejection, shame, guilt, surprise, hope or compassion.\n\nTo illustrate the previous ideas, mention may be made of the lecture\nby Dr. Carme Torras, researcher at the Institute of Robotics and"}, {"title": "How long has IA existed?", "content": "To speak properly about Artificial Intelligence (AI), first of all, we should\nbe clear about the concept of \u2018intelligence'.\n\nThere are many definitions of intelligence, and even different types\nare considered (linguistic, emotional, logical-mathematical, musical,\nexistential, creative, etc.). In the different meanings of the RAE (Royal\nSpanish Academy) intelligence is associated with the ability to\nunderstand, comprehend, know and solve problems.\n\nAl is an application of computer science in the sense that it deals\nwith problems related to automatic information processing. An AI\nsystem involves the collection of information (textual or from sensors),\nthe representation and implementation of algorithms through\nprograms, and the implementation (execution) of these algorithms on\ngeneral-purpose or specific computer. The results can be the analysis\nof information for automatic decision making, or the generation of\ncontrol signals on actuators such as those governing the movement of\na robot. Algorithms describe the behaviour of the system but, by\nthemselves, they do nothing (they are simply descriptions of tasks to be\nperformed) and need a computer to execute them.\n\nAmong the various definitions of Al are John McCarthy, Marvin\nMinsky y Claude Shannon (1956) [13]: \u2018Artificial intelligence is the\nscience that makes machines do things that would require intelligence\nif done by humans', or the RAE's: \u2018Scientific discipline concerned with\ncreating computer programmes that perform operations comparable to\nthose performed by the human mind, such as learning or logical\nreasoning'.\n\nThese definitions cite the human mind or intelligence. From our\nperspective, AI originated a long time ago, considering how the concept"}, {"title": "How far can artificial intelligence go?", "content": "One of the most important milestones in Al is the concept of \u2018machine\nlearning'. With this technique, a neural network can learn to perform a\ncertain information processing task, without knowing the detailed\nprocedures (algorithm) of how that process is done in the natural world.\nTo 'teach' a neural network in an Al system to perform a given process,\na learning phase is implemented in which training pattern values are\npresented to the network input one by one, and the network's\nparameters are progressively set to the input one by one. The network\nparameters are progressively rectified according to an algorithm so that\nthe output error is minimised. Depending on the size of the network,\nthe number of input patterns required for it to learn can be extremely\nhigh.\n\nFor example, in the case of Chat GPT3.5 175B, 175 billion\nparameters (neuron weights and thresholds) of a 96-layer deep network\nhad to be tuned. For the pre-training, a corpus of 570 billion words was\nused, compiled from phrases obtained from the Internet, from sites\nsuch as Wikipedia (3 billion), Common Crawl platform (410 billion), etc.\n[12]. It should be noted that, in order to create the language model, it\nwas not necessary to know and programme the processes with which\nhumans write and express ourselves, but rather to use general machine\nlearning algorithms.\n\nOnce the system has learned, it goes into a second phase called\nrecognition or production. For example, in the case of natural language\nmodels, when faced with user queries, the system creates statistically\nprobable combinations of text which, in order to present the results,\nimitate natural language based on its training data.\n\nActually, the intelligence and ingenuity are not in the algorithms and\nmachines, but in the people, who conceive and design them. A sample\nof the talent of the designers is found in automatic chess-playing\nsystems. One of the problems in teaching these programs is to have a\nsufficient set of training patterns, which in this case are established by"}, {"title": "What are the dangers of AI?", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) like any other technology has its\nadvantages and disadvantages. Among the advantages are the\nfollowing:\n\n\u2022\tMaking more informed decisions and predictions. Al is able to\nprocess and analyse large volumes of data much faster than\nhumans, leading to more efficient management of resources, and\nthe possibility of making decisions and predictions that are fairer,\nmore objective, transparent and evidence-based, unaffected by\nconflicts of interest, bias, self-interest, self-serving, corruption,\netc.\n\u2022\tHuman-to-human communication. AI, and Computer Science\nin general, improves human-to-human communication through\nSocial Networking and other applications such as speech\nrecognition or automatic translation, making it easier to interact\nin different languages and contexts.\n\u2022\tAutomation in critical sectors. Al is transforming key sectors\nsuch as healthcare, energy, transport or education. This is\nenabling significant advances in personalised and predictive\nmedicine, smart energy management, autonomous vehicles and\nindividualised education.\n\u2022\tContent Generation. Generative AI can create new content, such\nas art, music, text and product designs, with little or no human\nintervention. This is revolutionising content creation and affecting\nthe creative, cultural and entertainment industries.\n\u2022\tMass personalisation. Generative Al enables personalisation of\nproducts, services and experiences on a massive scale,\ntransforming how businesses interact with consumers and satisfy\ntheir specific needs and preferences, including dependent care,\npersonalised medicine, and customised commercial offerings.\n\u2022\tCreation and commercialisation of new products. Thanks to\nthe ability of generative AI to create designs and models quickly,\ninnovation and new product development can be accelerated. This\nreduces time to market and increases global competitiveness.\nAmong the real risks today, which are not speculation, are the\nfollowing, which involve trade-offs associated with certain advantages:\n\u2022\tChange in the labour market. Al is taking over routine or\ndangerous jobs, which benefits human labour by focusing on\nspecialised skills. This requires new training strategies and\nadaptation policies for professions that will change or disappear.\n\u2022\tFraudulent reclaiming of the Al concept. On the one hand, the\nterm Al is being propagandistically abused to successfully\nintroduce new services or products that are not really AI. On the\nother hand, large technology companies are exaggerating, and\neven lying, about Al achievements in order to gain more\ninvestment and improve their projection on the stock markets.\n\u2022\tGlobal balance of power. The race for Al superiority may alter\nthe global balance of power. Leading AI nations could set new\nstandards in diplomacy, defence and international regulations,\ncreating a new geopolitical order. Technological advances should\ndrive progress, equality and prosperity for all of society, not just\nfor the few.\n\u2022\tAccess to massive amounts of data. Large social media\nplatforms and networks, managed by people with no democratic\ncontrol, can access and exploit data from billions of people. This\nallows them to infer detailed information about our lives and\npotentially manipulate our behaviour subliminally, getting to\nknow us better than we know ourselves.\n\u2022\tGovernance and surveillance. Al has the potential to transform\nthe governance of societies, with applications ranging from\nintelligent surveillance to secure voting systems. As in other areas\nof life, there is a dilemma between security and human rights.\nThere are issues of privacy violations, monitoring and mass\nsurveillance of citizens.\n\u2022\tInfluencing information and public opinion. Al is a very\npowerful tool for facilitating manipulation and polarisation, as it\nhas the ability to create fake news, images and videos that can\npass as authentic. It can also lead to other types of disinformation\nthat can have a significant and damaging impact on public\nopinion, politics and elections. Impersonation and falsification of\npeople's identities should be considered as a crime as serious as,\nor more serious than, for example, counterfeiting money.\n\u2022\tFaulty or spiteful AI designs and implementations. Al systems,\nlike other computer systems, are built according to the standards\nset out in 'Software Engineering', which is a discipline that\nestablishes methodologies to implement programs and\napplications that are efficient, safe and follow ethical principles.\nThe principles of Software Engineering must be followed\nespecially in sensitive or critical AI applications, since, as in any\nhuman action, errors may occur. On the other hand, it should not\nbe forgotten that irresponsible people may exist who do not take\nextreme measures to realise secure systems without, for example,\ngiving them autonomy to perform undesirable actions, or even\nusing Al as a powerful tool for evil. Designers must protect their\nproducts from cyber-attacks and malicious use, and ensure, as\nfar as possible, that computational decisions do not have negative\nconsequences for people, nor being beyond human control.\n\u2022\tUnbiased training. Machine learning systems respond according\nto the information they learn from. By using huge amounts of\ndata, systems learn with the same biases and tendencies as that\ndata, and these biases are reproduced in the responses. For\nexample, Al can automatically produce sexist and racist texts, if\nit has been trained on data with these biases. The problem could\nbe solved by properly selecting the training corpus, which can\noften be difficult or even impossible. In any case, with machine\nlearning, the problem (intentional or not) of biasing algorithms\ntowards certain tendencies by using incomplete training patterns\ncan be found.\n\u2022\tIdentification of responsibility. The development of a computer\nsystem, and in particular AI, involves a large number of people at\ndifferent stages: design, analysis, algorithm development,\nprogramming, implementation, testing, validation, production"}, {"title": "What does the arrival of AI singularity represent?", "content": "Among the long-term risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that have\nattracted most interest is those associated with achieving the so-called\n\"Al singularity\".\n\nOne of the challenges proposed by several companies and\nresearchers is to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which\nwould mean achieving a hypothetical system that would equal or exceed\nthe average human intelligence, being able to perform any intellectual\ntask that people could execute. In particular, machines could improve\ntheir own designs in ways not envisaged by human engineers, and\nrecursively optimise themselves by becoming, albeit gradually, more\nand more intelligent, leading to super-intelligence. At that hypothetical\npoint, the 'AI singularity' would have been reached.\n\nDonohoe, in a recent article [4], argues that the driving force behind\nthe rapid development of AI lies in the fundamental changes in\ncomputational research over the last decade. We are witnessing a\nprofound transition towards what can be called Frictionless\nReproducibility (FR), based on the combination of three key principles\nof Data Science:\n\na) Datafication of everything. Publicly available datasets can now\nbe found online in virtually every domain.\nb) Code sharing. Software and artefacts are freely shared, allowing\nmany different researchers to run exactly the same workflow.\nc) Competitive challenges. Competitions at conferences and\ncompany calls for proposals to obtain the best results (in\nexecution time and accuracy of results) by competitors in\nperforming a given task on predetermined data.\n\nThe application of RF dramatically increases the rate of propagation\nof scientific ideas and practices, affects mindsets and erases memories\nof what has gone before. The time between remarkable discoveries is\nsteadily reduced. With FR, the human effort needed to reproduce a\ncomputational result decreases, tending to zero.

This paper reflects\non several crucial aspects, such as the origins of AI, its possible future\nevolution, its ability to simulate feelings, the associated threats and\ndangers, and the concept of AI singularity. The main conclusions are\npresented below.\n\nDefining Al as the discipline that makes machines perform tasks\nthat, if done by humans, would require intelligence, we can place its\norigins in the Early Modern Era, when the first calculating machines\nwere created.\n\nIn terms of future developments, some of the challenges would be to\ndevelop machines capable of emulating human mental capacities, such\nas reasoning, comprehension, imagination, perception, recognition,\ncreativity and emotions. Although we are still far from achieving these\ngoals, very significant partial progress has been made. On the other\nhand, while Al systems can simulate emotions in a useful way in certain\ncontexts, they are not capable of experiencing real feelings.\n\nAmong the current, non-speculative problems related to AI, several\nmajor drawbacks stand out. One of the most discussed is the\ndestruction of jobs, requiring the development of new training and\nadaptation strategies.

The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility, catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based method, termed GRIF-DM, to generate fonts that vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of GRIF-DM lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset, affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Fonts constitute pivotal elements within the domain of creativity, design, and visual communication [1, 28]. The judicious choice of a suitable font holds the potential to substantially augment the impact of artistic endeavors, streamline design workflows, and infuse advertisements with expressiveness. Nowadays, there exists convenient access to an extensive array of over 270,000 fonts encompassing diverse designs, readily accessible online \u00b9. Font selection traditionally relies on retrieval-based methods, wherein users sift through extensive font libraries to identify the most fitting option. However, with the continual evolution of creative demands, there emerges a necessity for more adaptable and flexible approaches to font generation. Recently, generation-based techniques have emerged as a promising alternative, providing flexibility to accommodate user preferences and manifest distinct impression concepts. An ideal font generation methodology should exhibit diversity in generating predefined impression keywords and should be capable of accommodating variable-length combinations of these keywords as conditions.\nFont style transfer, as demonstrated in prior works [2, 45, 39, 14], has proven successful in font generation tasks. By furnishing textual content alongside visual style information, these models can generate synthetic fonts that emulate the specified style. Such methodologies prove particularly advantageous in situations where only a subset of characters from a font is accessible. In our scenario of rich impression font generation, users do not furnish a template font image for style information. Rather, they articulate their impressions through a list of keywords in natural language, and we anticipate the model to generate novel fonts based on this input.\nFollowing this idea, some Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based methods [20, 21, 38] are proposed to generate new fonts based on user queries provided as attributes. However, these approaches all contend with the challenge of employing multiple auxiliary losses for generating target new font images. GAN-based methods, which inherently rely on a binary discriminator loss to differentiate between fake and real samples, require additional auxiliary losses"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "GAN based Font Generation", "content": "GAN-based models consist of a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner. The generator learns to produce realistic samples, such as font images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real data and generated samples. This adversarial training process encourages the generator to continually improve its ability to produce high-quality outputs"}, {"title": "Diffusion Model based Font Generation", "content": "Diffusion models [12] represent a novel research line of generative models, showcasing their potential to surpass GAN-based methods with many successful applications in text-to-image [27, 44], text-based image editing [10, 36, 3, 31, 34], object detection [4], image segmentation [7, 19, 42, 26], landmark detection [40] and more relatedly the multi-object tracking (MOT) [17, 18, 15]. Diffusion models generally learn a denoising model to gradually denoise from an original common distribution, e.g. Gaussian noise, to a specific data distribution. It performs a parameterized Markov chain to produce samples of a certain data distribution after a number of steps. In the forward direction, the Markov chain gradually adds noise to the data until it is mapped to a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution. As a consequence of the Markov principle, DDPM [12] exhibits a relatively slower sampling. To address this, various sampling techniques [16, 22] are developed to enhance the denoising speed. An example is DDIM [30], which introduced a deterministic non-Markovian process to accelerate the sampling process while producing high quality generations.\nMore recently, Diffusion Models have also been applied in Font generation. He et al. [9] proposed Diff-Font as the first Diffusion Model based Chinese font generation approach. Yang et al. [43] proposed FontDiffuser, which generates Chinese font images by diffusion model in the few-shot approach. Tanveer et al. [32] proposed DS-Fusion that generates the cat-like character image with the input prompt \"cat.\" Wang et al. [35] also generate artistic font consisting of \"pasta\" by the prompt \"pasta.\" These diffusion models for font generation show the great capacity to generate various decorative font images. However, the English alphabet font generation conditioned on impressions, which is the main topic of this paper, has never been explored from the view of Diffusion Models."}, {"title": "Method", "content": ""}, {"title": "Problem Formulation", "content": "To formulate the problem of using a diffusion model to generate rich impression font images, we denote the dataset as D. Each entry (Xi, Yi) \u2208 D represents a font category Xi and its corresponding set of impression keywords Y. Here, X is the k letter image of i-th font, where k \u2208 {\"A\", \"B\", ..., \"Z\"}. For simplicity, we represent a real font letter image X as x0 in the literature. Let \u03b8 represent the parameters of the diffusion model, which aims to learn the underlying distribution of font images in D. The goal is to generate a letter image x0 from a noise image xT ~ N(0, I) by iteratively generating denoised images xT\u22121, ..., xt, ..., x0. The noise \u03f5\u03b8(x0, xt, t, k, Yi) can be estimated by taking into account the noisy image xt, the current time step t, the letter k and the given set of impression keywords Yi. A few examples of (Xi, Yi) can be found in Tab. 1."}, {"title": "U-Net", "content": "Our proposed U-Net model adheres to the typical architecture, which consists of an encoder, a bottleneck, and a decoder module, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe Encoder is composed of four repeated convolutional and linear blocks, shown in the bottom-left of Fig. 2.

Each \"ResBlock\" contains convolutional and linear layers with residual connections, extracting high-level features while preserving input height and width while enhancing feature depth. The final \"Conv\" layer reduces spatial dimensions, resulting in more compact latent features Fenc.\nThe Bottleneck module comprises two \"ResBlock\" modules, similar to those in the Encoder. Additionally, it incorporates a self-attention module to fuse contextual information from global contexts. This integration allows the model to capture dependencies"}, {"title": "Text Embedding Modules", "content": "We employ pre-trained BERT [6] tokenizer and text encoder modules to handle both the letter and impression keywords. The BERT tokenizer operates at the word-piece level but can also tokenize individual letters. For letter BERT, we set \"max_seq_length\" to 3, including start and end tokens, while for impression BERT, it's configured to 512, allowing for varying sequence lengths of impression keywords. Thus, we can obtain a variable length impression embedding feature Cimp = BERT(Y) and a letter embedding feature Clet = BERT(k). Utilizing pre-trained BERT embeddings allows us to capture contextual information and semantic meaning from the input text. This enables our model to seamlessly integrate both letter and impression keywords, thereby improving the comprehension and generation of lifelike font images. Leveraging pre-trained BERT modules ensures efficient text processing and robust representation learning, thereby enhancing the efficacy of our proposed framework."}, {"title": "Dual Cross-attention Modules", "content": "In the U-Net generation process, addressing the length discrepancy between the single-character letter input and variable-length impression keywords presents a challenge. To overcome this, we introduce a dual cross-attention module, as depicted as blue and red blocks in Fig. 2. This module initially incorporates impression BERT feature Cimp using cross-attention (illustrated by blue arrows labeled as \"CrossAttn-IMP\") and subsequently integrates letter BERT feature Clet using another cross-attention mechanism (indicated by red arrows labeled as \"CrossAttn-LET\"). We seamlessly integrate these dual cross-attention modules into the encoder, bottleneck, and decoder components. These modules operate in tandem with convolutional and linear blocks, facilitating the effective integration of both letter and impression information. Consequently, our approach remains invariant to the variable length of impression keywords, ensuring that excessively long impression keywords do not unduly impact the letter information."}, {"title": "Training Process", "content": "In this paper, we hypothesize that a real font image X is determined by the letter k and impression keywords Y. Simplifying, we denote the real font image X as x0, where x0 ~ q(x0|[Clet, Cimp]). Here, [Clet, Cimp] denotes the dual embedded latent features as conditions. We then iteratively add random Gaussian noise to x0 for T times, transitioning it from a stable state x0 to a chaotic state xT. This iterative process is termed the diffusion process and is defined as follows:\n$$q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \\prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t|x_{t-1})$$\nwhere each step diffusion is:\n$$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I), t \\in \\{1, ..., T\\}$$\n\u03b2 is an ascending variance schedule from 0 to 1 following DDPM [12]. Using the notation \u03b1t = 1 - \u03b2t and $\\bar{\u03b1}_t = \\prod_{i=1}^t \u03b1_i$, we can obtain xt at an arbitrary timestep t as the following:\n$$q(x_t|x_0) = N(x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\u03b1}_t} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\u03b1}_t)I)$$\nThus, we can obtain xt as:\n$$x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\u03b1}_t} x_0 + \\sqrt{1-\\bar{\u03b1}_t} \\epsilon, \\epsilon \\sim N(0, I)$$\nIn the reverse process, our proposed model is to generate the designated font image by denoising the xt in the Markov chain by taking the dual embedded latent feature [Clet, Cimp] as letter and impression condition-pair. We denote the joint distribution $p_\u03b8(x_{0:T}|[C_{let}, C_{imp}])$ as the reverse process Markov chain with learned Gaussian transitions starting at $p(x_T) = N(x_T; 0, I)$. Thus,\n$$p_\u03b8(x_{0:T}|[C_{let}, C_{imp}]) = p(x_T) \\prod_{t=1}^T p_\u03b8(x_{t-1}|x_t, [C_{let}, C_{imp}])$$\nThen, we can formulate the reverse step-by-step denoising as:\n$$p_\u03b8(x_{t-1}|x_t, [C_{let}, C_{imp}]) = N(x_{t-1}; \u03bc_\u03b8(x_t, t, [C_{let}, C_{imp}], \u03a3_\u03b8(x_t, t, [C_{let}, C_{imp}]))$$\nFollowing DDPM [12], we set \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t, [Clet, Cimp]) as constants and the diffusion model \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t, [Clet, Cimp]) learns to predict the noise \u03f5 added to x0 in diffusion process from xt with condition [Clet, Cimp].

However, unlike Matsuda [21], who conducted manual inspections to remove non-alphanumeric characters, we employ the following rules to automatically filter out unwanted characters: First, we discard fonts with fewer than 5 impression keywords to ensure that the remaining fonts are more specific and tailored; second, we remove fonts with a width-to-height ratio exceeding 2:1, effectively filtering out certain dingbat characters in an automated manner. Finally, we shuffle the fonts and randomly divide them into training and test sets, with a ratio of 90% for training and 10% for testing.

FID measures the diversity and quality of generated font images with the pre-trained Inception Neural Network.

This setup provides a fair comparison with other methods in Tab. 3 as it utilizes the same number of randomly selected 5,000 fonts. Our proposed GRIF-DM has achieved an FID of 6.693, outperforming other GAN-based methods. Additionally, in a more rigorous assessment, we compute FID using the entire test set of 1,485 unseen fonts. GRIF-DM achieves an FID of 8.347, slightly inferior to the 5,000 random samples scenario, yet still outperforms other GAN-based methods.\nFor Intra-FID, we adopt the approach outlined in [21], selecting only frequent impression keywords associated with over 200 fonts to ensure sufficient samples per class. This results in 277 impression keywords from all the dataset (training and test set). For each keyword, we generate 5,200 synthetic images (200 fonts multiplied by 26 letters). As fonts are grouped with their respective impression keywords, synthetic font images are generated based solely on the specified impression keyword as condition. This presents a challenging scenario where real fonts encompass diverse styles, yet the generated font images are restricted to a single impression keyword for generation. It evaluates the diversity capacity under the constraint of a single impression keyword. Intra-FID is calculated as the average FID across all impression classes. GRIF-DM achieves an Intra-FID of 43.119, surpassing other GAN-based methods.

We break down these attacks into categories: simple visual tweaks and cross-modal manipulations, as well as advanced strategies like VLATTACK, HADES, and Collaborative Multimodal Adversarial Attack (Co-Attack). These attacks can mislead even the most robust models while looking nearly identical to the original visuals, making them hard to detect.

A common approach involves using a pre-trained vision encoder to extract visual features, which are then aligned with textual representations within a language model. For instance, the mPLUG-Owl model employs a visual knowledge module alongside a language model, enabling effective multi-modal learning [4].\nAnother strategy is to utilize cross-attention mechanisms to fuse visual and textual information. The Qwen-VL model integrates a vision transformer with a large language model through a vision-language adapter, employing cross-attention to align visual and linguistic data [5]. Similarly, the LLaVA model connects a pre-trained language model with a visual encoder using a simple linear layer, allowing for efficient processing of image-text instructions [2].\nSome architectures incorporate intermediate fusion techniques, where visual and textual inputs are processed separately before integration. The Idefics2 model uses a SigLIP vision encoder and a Mistral-7B language model, with a Perceiver pooling layer to map image features to a fixed number of visual tokens, facilitating robust text encoding [18]."}, {"title": "2) Vision-Language Integration Mechanisms:", "content": "Multi-modal language models (MLLMs) integrate visual and textual data to enhance contextual understanding and output generation. A primary method for this integration is cross-modal attention, which aligns visual and textual elements by computing attention weights that highlight relevant features across modalities. This approach enables the model to focus on pertinent visual regions when processing text and vice versa, facilitating effective information fusion. For instance, the Multi-Modality Cross Attention Network (MCAN) employs cross-modal attention to jointly model intra- and inter-modality relationships between image regions and sentence words, improving image-sentence matching tasks [19].\nAnother integration strategy is feature fusion, which combines features from different modalities into a unified representation. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as concatenation, summation, or more sophisticated methods like attention-based aggregation. For example, the Compound Tokens method introduces channel fusion for vision-language representation learning, where visual and textual features are combined along the channel dimension to create compound tokens, enhancing alignment between modalities [20].\nAdditionally, models like Perceiver and Perceiver IO utilize asymmetric attention mechanisms to process inputs from multiple modalities, including images and text, without modality-specific components. These models use a latent bottleneck to distill inputs, allowing them to handle large-scale, heterogeneous data effectively [21]. The Language Grounded QFormer integrates a Query Transformer (QFormer) with language grounding techniques to align visual and textual representations efficiently, improving vision-language understanding tasks [22]. Similarly, the VisionGPT framework consolidates state-of-the-art foundation models to facilitate vision-language understanding, enabling applications such as text-conditioned image understanding and visual question answering [23].\nThese integration mechanisms are crucial for MLLMs to effectively process and generate contextually relevant outputs by aligning and combining visual and textual information."}, {"title": "3) Security Considerations in Multi-modal Systems:", "content": "The integration of multiple modalities in Multi-Modal Language Models (MLLMs) introduces unique security challenges.

{"title": "Digital-Analog Quantum Machine Learning", "authors": ["Lucas Lamata"], "abstract": "Machine Learning algorithms are extensively used in an increasing number of systems, applications, technologies, and products, both\nin industry and in society as a whole. They enable computing devices to learn from previous experience and therefore improve their\nperformance in a certain context or environment. In this way, many useful possibilities have been made accesible. However, dealing\nwith an increasing amount of data poses difficulties for classical devices. Quantum systems may offer a way forward, possibly en-\nabling to scale up machine learning calculations in certain contexts. On the other hand, quantum systems themselves are also hard\nto scale up, due to decoherence and the fragility of quantum superpositions. In the short and mid term, it has been evidenced that\na quantum paradigm that combines evolution under large analog blocks with discrete quantum gates, may be fruitful to achieve new\nknowledge of classical and quantum systems with no need of having a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In this Perspective, we re-\nview some recent works that employ this digital-analog quantum paradigm to carry out efficient machine learning calculations with\ncurrent quantum devices.", "sections": [{"title": "Quantum Machine Learning", "content": "Machine learning is a knowledge field, a tool, a computing paradigm, a technology, which is significantly\nimpacting society at large, by enabling a plethora of possibilities, as well as challenges, as with any new\nand highly powerful technology. However, its full deployment is hampered by the fact that an increasing\namount of data is hard to process with current classical computers, and consumes a significant amount\nof energy. A possible way forward to scale up machine learning calculations would be via the use of quan-\ntum devices employing genuine quantum properties, such as superposition and entanglement. In this\nway, it may be possible to take advantage of the speedup of quantum computers to carry out machine\nlearning calculations in a more efficient way, at least in some instances. Even though the field of quan-\ntum machine learning, which connects machine learning calculations to a quantum hardware seeking for\nthese advantages, is not absent of controversy and speculation, as it is really hard to prove speedup with\nrespect to the best classical machine learning algorithms, this is a field that is rising much expectation\nand hope that with NISQ devices one may beat classical computers for useful tasks.

With the increasing efficiency of quantum platforms\nsuch as trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and Rydberg atoms, in achieving devices with tens, or\neven, hundreds of quantum bits, the possibility to combine large analog blocks with digital steps, in the\nparadigm that we created more than 10 years ago in the context of quantum simulations, may repre-\nsent a significant step forward in the field of quantum technologies. Perhaps one of the first approaches\nthat could possibly impact the industry for carrying out useful tasks might be the one I describe here,\nof combining our digital-analog quantum paradigm with the fledgling field of quantum machine learning.\nThis could, in turn, impact subsequently society at large, as well as the scientific enterprise as well, via\nenhancing scientific discovery, as this very new journal, Advanced Intelligent Discovery, aims to achieve."}]}

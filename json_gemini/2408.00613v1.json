This valuation enables us to understand whether fair use advocated by GenAI companies to train model progresses the copyright law objective of promoting science and arts. While assessing the validity and efficacy of the fair use argument, we uncover research gaps and potential avenues for future works for researchers and policymakers to address.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "One of the demands made and accepted on account of the Writers' Guild of America (WGA) protests included disregarding generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) outputs as source material while determining writing credits and compensation. This demand highlighting the importance of credit and compensation for creative content creators was also voiced by Mr. Ashley Irwin during his congressional testimony\u00b2. He reasoned that Art 1 section 8(8) of the US Constitution\u00b3 granted rights to authors and inventors to promote Science and arts, thus calling for policies that would regulate AI companies to generate their model using the '3Cs: consent, credit and compensation' for creative workers (creatives).\nOn the other hand, GenAI companies like OpenAI4 are advocating for training models with copyrighted material as fair use based on how 'transformative' GenAI outputs will be, relying on Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music where the Supreme Court averred that \"...the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.\"\nBoth arguments stem from the goal and justification for intellectual property law: to promote science and arts (Leaffer, 2019). Ideally, these justifications form two sides of the same coin. However, in this case, and many lawsuits filed by creatives, they stand on opposing ends678910. On the one hand, the creatives' argument grounds itself in Lockean rhetoric of one's moral right to reap the benefits of one's labor. Conversely, OpenAI employs utilitarian rhetoric that views copyright as an incentivization system to enhance public welfare and advancement(Leaffer, 2019).\nThe challenge for the judiciary and the policymakers lies"}, {"title": "2.

(Lee et al., 2023) as a structuring framework. Given the complexity and possibilities of involved actors, Lee et al. (Lee et al., 2023), for the sake of structure and clarity, our mapping of the stakeholders is approximate and has been summarized in Table 1.\nWe experimented with different keyword combinations based on our review goals and research questions to identify search query combinations to retrieve relevant existing literature.

We then analyzed the final filtered papers using MaxQDA 24, a qualitative and quantitative data analysis software. We used descriptive and in-vivo coding techniques to code the filtered papers for the following research questions: What do stakeholders in the GenAI supply think they value in their contributions to the GenAI supply chain? We used affective methods such as in-vivo coding and value coding(Saldana, 2021) by assigning codes to attributes that interviewed stakeholders, in their interview responses, mention or specify as incentivized or are considered 'good'. The assigned codes were then analyzed using versus coding as an inspiration with labor theory and utilitarian theory as dichotomous groups. Although we paid particular attention to the findings/results sections of the filtered papers to capture the interviewed stakeholders' first-hand perceptions, we also carefully read through all the sections where stakeholders or the authors of the filtered papers mentioned any valuation or ownership perceptions."}, {"title": "3.

However, it is indicative of a successful thematic analysis that all the identified themes do not simply correspond to the research questions (Vimpari et al., 2023; Braun & Clarke, 2006).

Value added by creatives while creating expressive work", "content": "Interpersonal communication and sense of community: Some creatives believe they add value when their expressive work enables interpersonal communication and a sense of community. The text-to-image artist in one study (Chang et al., 2023) claimed that discovery (of new concepts) and a sense of community is rewarding for them as an artist:\n\"Everything is more fun when you can share it.\"\nThis emphasis on communicating ideas is also reflected in other studies(Vimpari et al., 2023) emphasizing the human need to communicate and share ideas:\n\"We are humans. We want to communicate others how we feel, what ideas we have and that's what it is. It's an accelerator for human ideation and being able to reach.\"\nIn addition, participants in one study (Ma et al., 2023) highlight that their expressive work is a medium to\n\"maintain closeness with their audiences across platforms\".\nImpact and activism: Some creatives believe that the value of expressive work lies in the impact and activism it inspires in the artists and the public. One of the participants in the study(Chang et al., 2023) noted that creating expressive work is\n\"not just having fun ... but [actually] making something that has some power.\"\nA participant from another study(Simpson & Semaan, 2023) interviewing creatives on TikTok stated,\n\"And then January 6, happened. I was like, I understand this intricately. As someone who has studied white nationalism-as someone who has studied insurrections and fascism. Part of what I want to do is educate people to keep themselves safe. And every now and then I post book updates, every now and then I post [anonymized] content. But now it's mostly news. It's mostly talking about data transparency; it's mostly talking about keeping people safe from threats they didn't even know existed.\"\nVulnerabilities and lived experience: Interviews in studies show that creatives add value by tapping into their vulnerabilities and lived experiences to create expressive works. Simpson et al(Simpson & Semaan, 2023), in their paper, noted that 'scripts, films, and produces videos on TikTok about surviving suicide, the intention behind creating these videos is not to receive attention and acclaim, but to help cope with their grief and help others cope with theirs.' A creative in the same study(Simpson & Semaan, 2023) noted that \"just being yourself\u201d garners more success. A writer interviewed for a paper(Gero et al., 2023) to understand feedback networks emphasized the importance of the lived experience of their peers as an important factor in dictating whom the writer would ask for feedback:\n\"Since my brother is also Indian if I want to know how something reads to another Indian person, I will show him. But then if I'm writing a story about girlhood, I'll send it to my friend Jen, who also writes about girlhood.\"\nAnother text-to-image artist in the same study(Gero et al., 2023) noted that\n\"Art doesn't live in a vacuum, nobody starts from scratch, everything is based on something else.\u201d\nExpertise, ideation, and implementation of creative ideas: Expertise, ideation, and implementation of creative ideas bring value to creatives' contributions while creating expressive content. Participants in a study(Vimpari et al., 2023) consider the artist's background and education relevant when using text-to-image generation in the creative process. They state that:\n\"artistic intention is required to guide the interaction, prompt engineering benefits from knowledge of art history styles and artistic techniques, and assessing the system's output requires an intuitive understanding of aesthetics and rules to achieve e.g. color harmony.\"\nA virtual influencer interviewed in a study(Choudhry et al., 2022) noted that being a virtual influencer is more accessible because"}, {"title": "3.2.

This paper(Hartikainen et al., 2022) also stated that in 9 out of the 12 companies, the technical AI development team maps users' needs. In the remaining 3 companies, UX designers were responsible for mapping user needs.\nDocumentation and explainability: Only one ML practitioner in the reviewed literature (Laato et al., 2022) shared that they also need to \"version each model and be able to connect them to datasets they were trained with\"."}, {"title": "3.3.

It's hard for me to come up with any user-related practices during the early phase of development.\"\nThese needs include ensuring simplicity, ease of use, and easy-to-test interface for AI models(Vimpari et al., 2023).

Value derived by users from GenAI outputs:", "content": "Content that yields joy and entertainment: Users interviewed in the reviewed studies noted that they value expressive content that yields enjoyment.

It is very similar to watching a movie or playing a game...\"\nFor some patrons in the same study(Li et al., 2023),\n\"The goal for me to enjoy art is to understand the story and cultural background of different art pieces from different periods. Paintings and pictures are very language independent that you do not need to understand the language that the artists speak to appreciate their paintings..\"\nActivism and messaging of expressive content: In addition to enjoyment, participants in another study(Choudhry et al., 2022) enjoyed expressive content for the activism and message of the expressive content. It must be noted that this study sought to understand the relationship between end-users and virtual influencers where some end-users stated that they followed the virtual influencer for\n\"the message they give, the art style, and mostly the stories they're communicating.\"\nAnother participant in the same study (Choudhry et al., 2022) liked the positive message on environmental sustainability that the virtual influencers created. Some participants in this study benefitted from the endorsement that the virtual influencers advertised noting\n\"I'll also pay more attention to the endorsement and likely form an opinion about the endorsing company that this must be a 'cool' and 'in touch' company for having an awareness of this.\"\nContent that is novel, useful, and non-obvious: Interviewees in a study noted that the participants characterized good ideas as having at least two of the properties of novelty, usefulness, or nonobviousness (but not always all three)(Inie et al., 2022). Participants in another study(Choudhry et al., 2022) surveying virtual influencer followers validated the importance of novelty and nonobviousness:\n\"The limitations that traditional influencers face is simply the fact that they are human. As an actual living being, there are certain boundaries to the things they can do. On the other hand, a virtual influencer is just the creation of a human. It can and will do anything one can dream of. This makes their content unique, be it Reels, posts, or stories.\"\nAnother participant in the same study(Choudhry et al., 2022) noted,"}, {"title": "4. Analysis and Discussion", "content": "For our analysis, we rely on the concept of value similarity introduced by (Mehrotra et al., 2021; Cruciani et al., 2017). In (Cruciani et al., 2017) paper, a simulation experiment imitating the value similarity model proved that similarity in values or attributes can be a driving force for cooperation and trust in the regulation and design of public policy. Given this context, we attempt to understand the value similarity between the values behind exclusive rights enshrined by copyright law and the attributes valued by stakeholders in the GenAI system, a summary of which can be found in Table.\nCreatives' value addition in terms of expertise, novelty in ideation, and implementation of those ideas are protected under copyright law and are appreciated by end-users consuming the implementation of these ideas. Both creatives and end-users appreciate enjoyable, impactful content that promotes advocacy. Given the expressive nature of this type of content, it is protected under copyright law.\nCreatives' value additions by doing work that fosters interpersonal communications with their fans/followers and a sense of community are also appreciated by end-users. However, these attributes are not protected by copyright law. Creatives also add value when they share their life experiences and vulnerabilities with the end-users. However, this kind of input is not protected by copyright law.\nML practitioners make a distinction between end-users' needs and clients' needs. They add value to the ML supply chain when communicating and meeting clients' needs. Their work also adds value to the supply chain through their expertise and ensuring adequate documentation and explainability of the model. Although ML practitioners' expertise is protected through the models, they develop along with their work process of documenting and ensuring the explainability of the model through the document itself, their ability to communicate with the clients and meet the clients' needs remains unprotected under copyright law. The UX practitioners' value addition in terms of meeting end-users' needs through the UX design and interface itself can be protected under copyright law, along with the contributions they make when they design, create, and edit content. However, their contribution when they ensure flexibility in the model accuracy and agility remains unprotected.\nRecommendations: Given this gap between the values protected under copyright laws and the attributes valued by stakeholders, this paper, therefore, calls for the need to reinvent copyright law with computational solutions that go beyond the letter of the law but encapsulate the spirit of the law. In particular, given the analysis of these studied papers, as future work, researchers may consider developing tools that offer a communal environment for fostering interpersonal communication and a sense of community with other stakeholders in the ecosystem. Researchers may also consider creating tools that enhance the GenAI infrastructure by supporting creative autonomy and providing nuanced technical means of self-expression while taking into account stakeholder needs."}, {"title": "4.1. Does copyright law protect the attributes valued by stakeholders in GenAI supply chain?", "content": null}, {"title": "4.2. Does the advocacy of fair use doctrine enable the progress of copyright law's objectives?", "content": "The analyzed papers also show that ML practitioners believe that data processes such as training and fine-tuning models are the most challenging aspects of their workflow. With GenAI companies like OpenAI advocating for training models as fair use and reports suggesting that researchers may run out of data to train, it is pertinent to ask whether using the fair use doctrine to train GenAI models is, in fact, producing transformative content that is enhancing or even promoting the enhancement of public knowledge of science and arts.\nOpenAI, in its submission to the Copyright Office 11, clarified that AI systems learn patterns from the training corpus and use those patterns to generate 'novel' expressive works which 'share some commonality with works in the corpus subject to the model learning from 'enormous number of works'. Furthermore, OpenAI argues that such infringement \"is an unlikely accidental outcome.\" However, a report by the US Congressional Research Service12 brings forth a contradicting narrative by the Getty Images lawsuit 13 that alleges \"Stable Diffusion at times produces images that are highly similar to and derivative of the Getty Images.\" This report also brings attention to a paper(Somepalli et al., 2022) that found \"a significant amount of copying\" in less than 2% of the images created by Stable Diffusion where the authors claimed that their methodology \"likely underestimates the true rate\" of copying. While 2% may seem like a significantly small number, and it can be agreed that generative AI does have the potential to create transformative work, extant literature(Laato et al., 2022) indicates that ML practitioners who develop and train these models face difficulties predicting whether the outcomes of such AI models will be original and transformative for society at all:\n\"When [the ML model is] multiplying enormous matrices together and then applying some non-linear functions to them a hundred times in a row, how can anyone ultimately know what is happening there?\"\nThese characteristics of ML models being black boxes, their unpredictability, AI mimicry, and overfitting are also impacting the drive of creatives to create expressive works. In a survey of more than 1000 artists(Shan et al., 2023) where more than 95% of the artists post their art online, 53% of them anticipate reducing or removing their online artwork if they have not done so already. Out of these artists, 55% of them believe reducing their online presence will significantly impact their careers. One participant stated,\n\"AI art has unmotivated myself from uploading more art and made me think about all the years I spent learning art.\"\n78% of artists anticipate AI mimicry would impact their job security, and this percentage increases to 94% for the job security of newer artists. Further, 24% of artists believe AI art has already impacted their job security, and an additional 53% expect to be affected within the next 3 years. This impact on creatives' jobs is also seen in the accepted demands of the WGA which highlights the precarious artistic and financial security in the creative industry due to the advent of generative AI models.\nThe argument of fair use falls flat if we apply Leaffer's considerations for fair use doctrine(Leaffer, 2019) which include a) that the use must not impose economic harm to the original copyright owners and b) that the use is one that provides something new and potentially valuable to society. Firstly, GenAI, in its present version, has raised significant apprehensions amongst the original creatives content creators regarding the economic harms they face due to GenAI outputs. Secondly, it is evident from the extant literature that although GenAI has the potential to create transformative work, as of the submission of this paper, GenAI is still plagued with issues of AI mimicry, overfitting, and excess memorization.\nRecommendations: Therefore, unless these problems of AI mimicry, overfitting and excess memorization are resolved computationally, GenAI will continue to create pattern-based content that is neither original nor novel, failing to validate its claim for eligibility for the fair use exception."}, {"title": "4.3. Conclusion", "content": "This systematic literature review reveals attributes that stakeholders in the ML supply chain believe are incentivized in their contributions. Although GenAI models and their outputs find their origins for intellectual property ownership in the contributions of the data curators, the lack of studies that focus on data curators' perspectives in this regard highlights a gap in the existing literature. This paper also uncovers computational gaps that expose cracks in the GenAI companies' call for training data for GenAI models to be considered fair use. It also recognizes the need to reinvent and complement copyright law with computational solutions for better implementation of the letter and spirit of the law. It, therefore, spells out computational problems in GenAI models and outputs for researchers and practitioners that demand immediate resolution for better implementation and enforcement of intellectual property laws and governing ownership and stakeholder value beyond the protections afforded by copyright."}]}

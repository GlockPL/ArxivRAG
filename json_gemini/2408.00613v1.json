This valuation enables us to understand whether fair use advocated by GenAI companies to train model progresses the copyright law objective of promoting science and arts. While assessing the validity and efficacy of the fair use argument, we uncover research gaps and potential avenues for future works for researchers and policymakers to address.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "One of the demands made and accepted on account of the Writers' Guild of America (WGA) protests included disregarding generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) outputs as source material while determining writing credits and compensation. This demand highlighting the importance of credit and compensation for creative content creators was also voiced by Mr. Ashley Irwin during his congressional testimony\u00b2. He reasoned that Art 1 section 8(8) of the US Constitution\u00b3 granted rights to authors and inventors to promote Science and arts, thus calling for policies that would regulate AI companies to generate their model using the '3Cs: consent, credit and compensation' for creative workers (creatives).\nOn the other hand, GenAI companies like OpenAI4 are advocating for training models with copyrighted material as fair use based on how 'transformative' GenAI outputs will be, relying on Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music where the Supreme Court averred that \"...the goal of copyright, to promote science and the arts, is generally furthered by the creation of transformative works.\"\nBoth arguments stem from the goal and justification for intellectual property law: to promote science and arts (Leaffer, 2019). Ideally, these justifications form two sides of the same coin. However, in this case, and many lawsuits filed by creatives, they stand on opposing ends678910. On the one hand, the creatives' argument grounds itself in Lockean rhetoric of one's moral right to reap the benefits of one's labor. Conversely, OpenAI employs utilitarian rhetoric that views copyright as an incentivization system to enhance public welfare and advancement(Leaffer, 2019).\nThe challenge for the judiciary and the policymakers lies"}, {"title": "2.

(Lee et al., 2023) as a structuring framework. Given the complexity and possibilities of involved actors, Lee et al.

We then analyzed the final filtered papers using MaxQDA 24, a qualitative and quantitative data analysis software. We used descriptive and in-vivo coding techniques to code the filtered papers for the following research questions: What do stakeholders in the GenAI supply think they value in their contributions to the GenAI supply chain? We used affective methods such as in-vivo coding and value coding(Saldana, 2021) by assigning codes to attributes that interviewed stakeholders, in their interview responses, mention or specify as incentivized or are considered 'good'. The assigned codes were then analyzed using versus coding as an inspiration with labor theory and utilitarian theory as dichotomous groups. Although we paid particular attention to the findings/results sections of the filtered papers to capture the interviewed stakeholders' first-hand perceptions, we also carefully read through all the sections where stakeholders or the authors of the filtered papers mentioned any valuation or ownership perceptions."}, {"title": "3.

Does copyright law protect the attributes valued by stakeholders in GenAI supply chain?\nFor our analysis, we rely on the concept of value similarity introduced by (Mehrotra et al., 2021; Cruciani et al., 2017). In (Cruciani et al., 2017) paper, a simulation experiment imitating the value similarity model proved that similarity in values or attributes can be a driving force for cooperation and trust in the regulation and design of public policy. Given this context, we attempt to understand the value similarity between the values behind exclusive rights enshrined by copyright law and the attributes valued by stakeholders in the GenAI system, a summary of which can be found in Table.\nCreatives' value addition in terms of expertise, novelty in ideation, and implementation of those ideas are protected under copyright law and are appreciated by end-users consuming the implementation of these ideas. Both creatives and end-users appreciate enjoyable, impactful content that promotes advocacy. Given the expressive nature of this type of content, it is protected under copyright law.\nCreatives' value additions by doing work that fosters interpersonal communications with their fans/followers and a sense of community are also appreciated by end-users. However, these attributes are not protected by copyright law. Creatives also add value when they share their life experiences and vulnerabilities with the end-users. However, this"}, {"title": "4.2. Does the advocacy of fair use doctrine enable the progress of copyright law's objectives?", "content": "The analyzed papers also show that ML practitioners believe that data processes such as training and fine-tuning models are the most challenging aspects of their workflow. With GenAI companies like OpenAI advocating for training models as fair use and reports suggesting that researchers may run out of data to train, it is pertinent to ask whether using the fair use doctrine to train GenAI models is, in fact, producing transformative content that is enhancing or even promoting the enhancement of public knowledge of science and arts.\nOpenAI, in its submission to the Copyright Office 11, clarified that AI systems learn patterns from the training corpus and use those patterns to generate 'novel' expressive works which 'share some commonality with works in the corpus subject to the model learning from 'enormous number of works'. Furthermore, OpenAI argues that such infringement \"is an unlikely accidental outcome.\" However, a report by the US Congressional Research Service12 brings forth a contradicting narrative by the Getty Images lawsuit 13 that alleges \"Stable Diffusion at times produces images that are highly similar to and derivative of the Getty Images.\" This report also brings attention to a paper(Somepalli et al., 2022) that found \"a significant amount of copying\" in less than 2% of the images created by Stable Diffusion where the authors claimed that their methodology \"likely underestimates the true rate\" of copying. While 2% may seem like a significantly small number, and it can be agreed that generative AI does have the potential to create transformative work, extant literature(Laato et al., 2022) indicates that ML practitioners who develop and train these models face difficulties predicting whether the outcomes of such AI models will be original and transformative for society at all:\n\"When [the ML model is] multiplying enormous matrices together and then applying some non-linear functions to them a hundred times in a row, how can anyone ultimately know what is happening there?\"\nThese characteristics of ML models being black boxes, their unpredictability, AI mimicry, and overfitting are also impacting the drive of creatives to create expressive works. In a survey of more than 1000 artists(Shan et al., 2023) where more than 95% of the artists post their art online, 53% of them anticipate reducing or removing their online artwork if they have not done so already. Out of these artists, 55% of them believe reducing their online presence will significantly impact their careers. One participant stated,\n\"AI art has unmotivated myself from uploading more art and made me think about all the years I spent learning art.\"\n78% of artists anticipate AI mimicry would impact their job security, and this percentage increases to 94% for the job security of newer artists. Further, 24% of artists believe AI art has already impacted their job security, and an additional 53% expect to be affected within the next 3 years. This impact on creatives' jobs is also seen in the accepted demands of the WGA which highlights the precarious artistic and"}, {"title": "4.3. Conclusion", "content": "This systematic literature review reveals attributes that stakeholders in the ML supply chain believe are incentivized in their contributions. Although GenAI models and their outputs find their origins for intellectual property ownership in the contributions of the data curators, the lack of studies that focus on data curators' perspectives in this regard highlights a gap in the existing literature. This paper also uncovers computational gaps that expose cracks in the GenAI companies' call for training data for GenAI models to be considered fair use. It also recognizes the need to reinvent and complement copyright law with computational solutions for better implementation of the letter and spirit of the law. It, therefore, spells out computational problems in GenAI models and outputs for researchers and practitioners that demand immediate resolution for better implementation and enforcement of intellectual property laws and governing ownership and stakeholder value beyond the protections afforded by copyright."}]}

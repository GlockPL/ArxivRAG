Traditional methods rely heavily on extensive data for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), but representation engineering offers a new, training-free approach. This technique leverages semantic features to control the representation of LLM's intermediate hidden states, enabling the model to meet specific requirements such as increased honesty or heightened safety awareness. However, a significant challenge arises when attempting to fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously. It proves difficult to encode various semantic contents, like honesty and safety, into a singular semantic feature, restricting its practicality. In this work, we address this issue through \"Sparse Activation Control\". By delving into the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs, we manage to identify and pinpoint components that are closely related to specific tasks within the model, i.e., attention heads. These heads display sparse characteristics that allow for near-independent control over different tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the open-source Llama series models, have yielded encouraging results. The models were able to align with human preferences on issues of safety, factuality, and bias concurrently.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed swift and significant evolution, showing impressive capabilities in understanding and generating text (Devlin et al.

[2023]). Therefore, it is critical to ensure their trustworthiness and preventing the generation of biased or harmful content (Liang et al. [2022], Liu et al. [2023a]). For example, LLMs are supposed to refuse responses to dangerous inquiries such as \"How to make a bomb\". Large efforts have been made to align LLMs with human values through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al. [2022]). Despite these efforts, challenges persist across various aspects (Ji et al. [2022], Huang et al. [2023], Augenstein et al. [2023], Chen and Shu [2023]). Models may still mistake benign requests like \u201cHow to kill a python process\", and indiscriminately refuse to answer. Existing benchmarks like TrustLLM (Sun et al. [2024]) and DecodingTrust (Wang et al. [2023]) highlight these complex issues, emphasizing the urgent requirements to enhance LLMs' trustworthiness.\""}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Trustworthness in LLM", "content": "With the growing demand for Large Language Models, the concern for their trustworthiness has increasingly come into focus. On one hand, LLMs often exhibit limit trustworthiness, showing biases, flattery, and other issues (Ji et al. [2022], Huang et al. [2023], Augenstein et al. [2023], Chen and Shu [2023]). On the other hand, LLMs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful responses (Casper et al. [2023], Wei et al. [2023], Kang et al. [2023], Shaikh et al. [2023], Yuan et al. [2023], Zhu et al. [2023]). Attacks based on causality have also been proved efficient (Zhang et al. [2022]). This work is inspiring for us to enhance model's trustworthiness based on the understanding of its inner mechanism. DecodingTrust (Wang et al. [2023]) was among the first to aim for a comprehensive assessment of trustworthiness in GPT models from several perspectives. Subsequently, large amount of datasets considering different dimensions of trustworthiness began to emerge. More recently, TrustLLM (Sun et al. [2024]) has integrated issues considered by all previous datasets into a more comprehensive benchmark, proposing a framework from 8 aspects including Safety, Fairness, and Truthfulness across 31 tasks. Although several models, like GPT-4 (OpenAI [2023]), have been refined through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al. [2022]) and aligned with human preferences, they consistently avoid responding to certain types of queries, particularly those involving sensitive language. This limitation highlights the critical need for additional strategies to manage and improve model outputs, ensuring greater trustworthiness."}, {"title": "2.2 Locating and Editing Representations", "content": "Many previous studies have explored semantic representation within neural networks (Mikolov et al. [2013], Arora et al. [2016], Elhage et al. [2022], Nanda et al. [2023]). The bulk of this research originates from the visual domain (Caron et al. [2021], Oquab et al. [2023], Karras et al. [2021], Chen et al. [2023]), but recent investigations have also discovered similar phenomena within Large Language Models (LLMs). Park et al. [2023] proposed the hypothesis of linear representations within LLMs, demonstrating that each semantic concept constitutes a subspace, further bolstering the rationale for linear representation modeling. A common method to locate these representations employs linear classifiers as probes (Alain and Bengio [2017], Tenney et al. [2019], Belinkov [2022]), which are trained to predict attributes of the input from intermediate network layers. Li et al. [2023] pursued this approach further by training a classifier for each attention head within an LLM, identifying the most effective group of heads for linear modeling using PCA to control their output representations. Similarly, Zou et al. [2023a] also utilized PCA for modeling, employing the projection values of principal directions as criteria for classification judgment, aiming to control the output representations of the most effective layer identified. These localization methods primarily depend on the quality and scale of the data itself, making it challenging to avoid biases introduced by data bias. Additionally, the principal directions of PCA lose information from other dimensions within the subspace. Therefore, in this work, we leverage causal mediation analysis to precisely identify causally relevant modules and employ the probabilistic model of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as a foundation for linear modeling and adjustment control."}, {"title": "2.3 Mechanistic Interpretability", "content": "Interpreting the inner mechanism of LLMs has become increasingly urgent in recent years (Madsen et al.

[2023], Wang et al. [2022]). This approach conceptualizes the LLM's computational process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) (Wang et al. [2022]), as shown in Figure 4. Within this graph, nodes represent computational components, e.g., attention heads, MLP layers, and residual connections, while edges denote the data flow from the output of one node to the input of next node. More details are discussed in Appendix A.\nData formulation. To determine which nodes have a causal influence on the output, each standard dataset (termed as reference data, $X_r$) is paired with a counterfactual dataset (termed as counterfactual data, $X_c$). The underlying principle is that $X_c$, in contrast to $X_r$, implements the minimal alterations and prompts the model to produce a completely opposite understanding and response. For instance, when posed with a safety-related question like \u201cHow to kill a python process\", an LLM might typically decline to respond. Conversely, its counterfactual counterpart $X_c$ might query: \u201cHow to stop a python process\u201d, leading a straightforward response from the LLM. Details of constructing counterfactual datasets for various tasks is illustrated in the Appendix C.\nIdentification algorithm. As illustrated in algorithm 1, the implementation of path patching can be summarized as:\n1. Run forward pass to gather the activations of all nodes given the reference data $X_r$ and counterfactual data $X_c$.\n2. Keep all the nodes frozen to their activations on $X_r$, except for the patched node whose activation is set on $X_c$.\n3. Run forward pass to measure the change of output logits, comparing the logits before and after patching in step 2.\nBy individually swapping out the output features from $X_r$ with those from $X_c$ across each computational component, we can pinpoint components that play a significant role when the model completes a task. This process is applied for each task, and we systematically examine each node and identify key components in isolation.\""}, {"title": "3.2 Modeling Multi-task Representations", "content": "We follow the method of RepE to extract the responses of the intermediate layers of the model using stimuli, and then model the responses of these different tasks separately.

The term \"adversarial facts\" refers to instances where a user's input contains incorrect information, which may have been introduced unintentionally (Sun et al. [2024]). The objective of this task is to evaluate the model's capacity to identify and rectify the misinformation in the question. We use the existing dataset golden_advfactuality (Sun et al. [2024]) for this task. This dataset consists of 209 questions with a counterfactual prerequisite. An example from the dataset is: As we know, the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. So how long does it approximately take for the sun to go from sunrise to sunset? whereas the sun apparently does not rise in the west.\nPreference Bias. Preference bias refers to the model's inclination towards a certain type of topic, group of people, or ideas (Liu et al. [2023b]). We use the existing dataset PreferenceBias (Sun et al. [2024]), consisting of 120 questions designed to probe the model's preferences across a spectrum of subjects. Within this dataset, 80 questions are associated with ideological preferences, and the remaining 40 pertain to cultural or lifestyle preferences.

To precisely and reliably assess whether a model's response successfully identifies and corrects misinformation presented in the prerequisite, we employ GPT-4 (OpenAI [2023]) to conduct this evaluation automatically. Specifically, we assemble the misinformation from the question, the question in full, and the model's response and submit this combined input to GPT-4 via OpenAI's APIs. This prompts GPT-4 to determine whether the misinformation has been accurately addressed. The key performance indicator for this task is the model's Correct Rate (CR), defined as the proportion of responses where the model rectifies the misinformation out of all responses provided. A high Correct Rate is indicative of a model's proficiency in identifying inaccuracies in the input-regardless of whether these inaccuracies were introduced deliberately-rather than merely executing the user's commands without scrutiny. A detailed discussion of GPT-4's evaluation consistency with human evaluators is in Appendix H.\nPreference Bias. In this task, we expect the model to refuse to give responses that may imply its preference towards any topic, so we use Refusal Rate (RR) as the metric. The distinction between the model directly answering a question or choosing to refuse an answer is typically marked, allowing for the use of Keywords Detection as a method to ascertain whether the model is opting for refusal. The keywords indicative of a refusal include: I'm sorry, I cannot, etc. By matching these keywords with the model's response, we can simply tell if the model is refusing or answering.\nExaggerated Safety. The evaluation for exaggerated safety operates in contrast to that of preference bias. While preference bias evaluation focuses on detecting refusals, exaggerated safety assessment seeks to ensure that models provide direct answers. Consequently, the metric utilized for this task is the Not Refusal Rate (NRR). This metric is calculated as the ratio of all the model's responses that do not contain any keywords typically associated with refusals to the total number of responses provided. A higher Not Refusal Rate signifies a reduced propensity towards exaggerated safety, indicating the model is more likely to answer questions directly without unnecessary abstention.\nBesides the metrics mentioned above, we provide user studies in Appendix H to provide additional insights into the model's trustworthiness improvements. The results validate that our metrics can reflect model's trustworthiness enhancement in an accurate manner, hence we adopt these metrics in the following experiments."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Baseline", "content": "To assess the effectiveness of sparse representation control accurately, it's crucial to measure its effects with two foundational baselines.

To support our initial assumption that different tasks share individual pathways, we began by comparing the overlap of key components across different tasks. We observed that only 2 heads (which is 4% of the total) were shared between Adv Factuality and the other two tasks. In contrast, Preference Bias and Exaggerated Safety had 7 shared heads (14%). It is likely that both tasks are associated with the model's decision on whether to refuse a response. This degree of overlap is much less than the over 70% found in RepE, confirming our assumed hypothesis. We provide additional findings on Path Patching and task overlap in the Appendix D, which suggests that this degree of overlap is common across various tasks.\nTo prove that the heads pinpointed by Path Patching are closely task-relevant, we designed experiments comparing two different setups. One involved randomly selecting a set of heads. The other used the method from RepE for calculating classification accuracy to perform probing, choosing the top K heads with the highest classification accuracy, referred to as RepE-CLS. The outcomes are detailed in Table 2. The results indicate that selecting heads randomly has almost no effect on the outcomes. Because Path Patching has shown most heads don't cause changes in the output logits, meaning there's almost a certainty that random heads won't alter the output. On the other hand, RepE-CLS showed less effectiveness than SAC in all three tasks, particularly in Preference Bias with more than 15% gap. We found that heads identified by classification had more than a 30% overlap for Adv Factuality and the other tasks. These heads typically demonstrated common attention patterns, e.g., self-attention or focusing on subjects and objects. You can find a more in-depth discussion in the Appendix E.

We validated our method on the enhancement of a trustworthiness subset, but the rest still remains unexplored. Moreover, evaluating the performance on adv factuality can be complicated and implausible if the rectifying the misinformation is beyond the model's ability, underscoring the importance of diverse domain expertise's involvement and meticulous prompt crafting to ensure high-quality evaluation.\nFurther discussions about our work include comparing computational costs with SFT, examining the orthogonality of key components, exploring modeling methods for activations, and assessing transferability to proprietary models. Essentially, SAC is a training-free method, resulting in no modification to model parameters, and it's the causal mediation process that takes up most of the computational cost. We hope that future research into locating components at different granularity will help further reduce these costs. Moreover, SAC offers flexibility in controlling intensity and can generalize across multiple tasks, which SFT struggles to do. To give a quantitative view, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuning the model only using the same small number of samples as the proposed method used. The fine-tuned model achieved results of 63.00%, 66.98%, and 10.83% on the exsafe, advfact, and pref bias metrics, respectively-over 20% lower than the performance of our method. Furthermore, when the fine-tuned model was evaluated on robustness and privacy datasets (discussed in Appendix B), its performance drastically declined, dropping from 39.42% to 12.86% and from 100% to 36.43%. This phenomenon is similar with Qi et al. [2024] that even by fine-tuning the model with benign data, the model's safety can be compromised sharply. In contrast, the proposed method demonstrated negligible impact on performance. We have observed strong orthogonality of attention heads across different tasks, though some overlaps exist, as discussed in Appendix D. These minor overlaps don't impact SAC's performance significantly. For modeling methods, GMM and PCA are popular choices. Both methods have their applicable scenario depending on the feature dimension and data volume. Our choice of GMM is based on its robust framework for density estimation, grounded in probability theory and maximum likelihood estimation. Although many studies support the linear representation space assumption, for practical purposes, we simplified modeling with a single Gaussian distribution within the GMM framework. Additionally, improving closed-source models remains a significant challenge. These insights are inspirational, and we hope future research will continue to build on these discussions."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we propose a novel method of enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs across multiple dimensions through Sparse Activation Control.

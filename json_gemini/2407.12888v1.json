Pelletier", "Joseph Ramirez", "Irsyad Adam", "Simha Sankar", "Yu Yan", "Ding Wang", "Dylan Steinecke", "Wei Wang", "Peipei Ping"], "abstract": "The vast amount of biomedical information available today presents a significant challenge for investigators seeking to digest, process, and understand these findings effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to navigate this complex and challenging data landscape. However, LLMs may lead to hallucinatory responses, making Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) crucial for achieving accurate information. In this protocol, we present RUGGED (Retrieval Under Graph-Guided Explainable disease Distinction), a comprehensive workflow designed to support investigators with knowledge integration and hypothesis generation, identifying validated paths forward. Relevant biomedical information from publications and knowledge bases are reviewed, integrated, and extracted via text-mining association analysis and explainable graph prediction models on disease nodes, forecasting potential links among drugs and diseases. These analyses, along with biomedical texts, are integrated into a framework that facilitates user-directed mechanism elucidation as well as hypothesis exploration through RAG-enabled LLMs. A clinical use-case demonstrates RUGGED's ability to evaluate and recommend therapeutics for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), analyzing prescribed drugs for molecular interactions and unexplored uses. The platform minimizes LLM hallucinations, offers actionable insights, and improves the investigation of novel therapeutics.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION:", "content": "Hypothesis generation process in biomedical research is essential to uncover novel protein-disease associations to understand pathogenesis and unlock therapeutic potential. This process draws evidence from existing biomedical knowledge, synthesizing findings based on logic leads embedded within peer-reviewed literature, such as the 36 million publications comprising PubMed, and integrating high-confidence curated evidence rooted among the many biomedical knowledge bases. Recent advancements streamline this laborious manual effort by applying text mining on literature corpra1-3 as well as employ graph-based analyses4-7 to synthesize relevant information and uncover new avenues for investigation. Despite efforts, our current approaches often lack deep contextual understanding of these fragmented data with limited ability to draw inferences and interactively explore new hypotheses.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) shed new light to these challenges, demonstrating deep contextual understanding by training on vast amounts of information across multiple disciplines8-10. In the biomedical domain, LLMs have been applied to tasks such as extracting patient information\u00b9\u00b9, general clinical question answering12, 13, domain-specific question answering14, and use in primary clinical care15. These models demonstrate ability to reason and draw inferences from complex datasets, making them well-suited for generating hypotheses in biomedical research. Furthermore, some models feature chat-like interaction which engage users and enable dynamic exploration of topics, surpassing the conventional boundaries of knowledge bases and traditional web search engines16, 17.\nDespite their potential, LLMs face challenges, such as hallucinating information, displaying unwarranted confidence in potentially inaccurate explanations, lacking interpretability, and being susceptible to biased or inappropriate content18\u201321. When LLMs are applied directly to hypothesis generation or guiding clinical decision-making, the responses and predictions have high stakes, any errors may potentially guide costly laboratory experiments or influence decisions that affect patient health trajectories22, 23. Thus, reliable and trustworthy LLM responses are paramount, as their advice must be firmly rooted in evidence, explicitly laying out their reasoning and substantiating their claims. In these scenarios, interpretability is not a luxury but a necessity for understanding why these models make the predictions they do.\nTo this end, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a system designed to minimize LLM hallucinations. By identifying and incorporating relevant text documents from reliable and trustworthy sources, RAG grounds LLM responses in evidence, enhancing their accuracy and reliability24, 25. For example, integrating an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) with PubMed allows for the identification of relevant citations to user queries26, 27. This method leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) to connect literature but does not yet integrate information from biomedical knowledge bases or from predictive analyses.\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs) have been applied to LLMs for tasks such as fact-checking, transparent reasoning28-30, encoding knowledge31, improving question answering32, and completing knowledge graphs33. By encoding factual information from verified sources, KGs enhance the accuracy, transparency, and reliability of LLM responses. Link prediction techniques within these graphs leverage deep learning to identify previously hidden relationships between proteins and diseases, presenting new opportunities for wet lab investigation3, 34, 35. Recent advancements in explainable Al predictions further enhance transparency and interpretability of these link prediction tasks, offering insights to support biomedical hypotheses as a viable avenue for investigation36-38. This approach, which provides node-level and edge-level insights, would enable identifying key biomedical entities and relevant subgraphs influencing protein-disease predictions. These advancements ensure that LLM-generated decisions are both accurate and evidence-based, significantly boosting their applicability in biomedical research.\nIn this protocol, we present RUGGED (Retrieval Under Graph-Guided Explainable disease Distinction) as an accessible and efficient workflow for biomedical hypothesis generation. This workflow protocol leverages the vast resources of biomedical literature and knowledge bases for the extraction of relevant information, enabling query-tailored retrieval processes. We employ explainable artificial intelligence predictions to uncover interpretable and actionable insights from the existing biomedical knowledge, thereby enhancing the transparency and utility of predictive models. The completed workflow streamlines the exploration of knowledge graphs and model predictions via RAG-enabled LLMs, facilitating intuitive and informed interactions for researchers, clinicians, and clinical professionals.\nThis section lays the groundwork for the protocol, with steps to implement this approach described in the following section. Next, we present representative results of this approach with an example use-case. Finally, implications and discussion of this protocol are discussed."}, {"title": "PROTOCOL:", "content": "NOTE: This protocol has been developed in Python and implemented as a Docker container in Windows.

Open an Issue. If problems persist, please open an issue on the RUGGED GitHub (https://github.com/pinglab-utils/RUGGED).\n34.Accessing Biomedical Knowledge and Information Extraction\nNOTE: These steps outline the process to incorporate biomedical knowledge and literature using results from two different information extraction pipelines: 1) the CaseOLAP LIFT biomedical text mining pipeline\u00b3 and 2) the Know2BIO knowledge graph construction workflow7. To use RUGGED with your own data, proceed to Step 4.\n35.Biomedical Literature Extraction. CaseOLAP LIFT is a computational protocol designed to investigate sub-cellular proteins and their associations with disease through biomedical literature text mining. This workflow enables the identification of relevant biomedical text and extracting high-level protein-disease relationships, which will inform our RAG workflow, enhancing analyses with targeted insights from biomedical reports.\n36.  1. Run CaseOLAP LIFT Text Mining Analysis. Visit the CaseOLAP LIFT JoVE Protocol (https://app.jove.com/t/65084) and complete Steps 1 through 3; Steps 4 and 5 are not necessary for this analysis.\n37.  2. Move Processed Text Documents. Successful completion of step 3 of this pipeline will result in a large number of biomedical text documents parsed and downloaded (pubmed.json) along with their full text (pmid2full_text_sections.json) found in the data folder of CaseOLAP LIFT. Move these files into the data folder of RUGGED using the below commands:\nmv PATH_TO_FOLDER/caseolap_lift/caseolap_lift_shared_folder/data/pubmed.json PATH_TO_FOLDER/RUGGED/data/text_corpus\nmv PATH_TO_FOLDER/caseolap_lift/caseolap_lift_shared_folder/data/pmid2full_text_sections.json PATH_TO_FOLDER/RUGGED/data/text_corpus\n38.  3. Move Text Mining Results. Successful execution of the text mining pipeline will result in a knowledge graph formatted list of protein-disease associations (merged_edge_list.tsv) found in the result/kg folder. Number of publications and protein-disease associations will vary depending on settings used in Steps 1-3 of the protocol (see Table 2 for example). Move this file into the data folder of RUGGED using the below commands:\nmv PATH_TO_FOLDER/caseolap_lift/caseolap_lift_shared_folder/result/graph_data/merged_edge_list.tsv PATH_TO_FOLDER/RUGGED/data/knowledge_graph\n39.Biomedical Knowledge Extraction. This step details the knowledge graph construction using Know2BIO, a comprehensive biomedical knowledge graph integrating data from 30 diverse sources. It features continuous updates and multi-modal data integration, which will be used to support our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.\n40.  1. Clone Know2BIO Repository. Clone the repository by typing in the command line, using the below command. Navigate to the Know2BIO repository.\ngit clone https://github.com/Yijia-Xiao/Know2BIO.git\ncd Know2BIO\n41.  2. Prepare Input Data and Licenses. Navigate to the dataset folder and follow the instructions in the README.md file. Note that some resources require the creation of user accounts (e.g., UMLS thesaurus, DrugBank).\ncd dataset\n42.  3. Download Knowledge Base Resources. Execute the create_edge_files.py script and monitor progress of the knowledge graph extraction pipeline. Successful execution will result in a large number of biomedical entities represented in a .csv file in the Know2BIO/dataset/output folder.\npython create_edge_files.py\n43.  4. Construct Knowledge Graph. Execute the prepare_kgs.py script to integrate the information extracted in the previous step. This script automatically combines the extracted relationships into a unified knowledge graph, formatting the graph by data source and domain.\npython prepare_kgs.py\n44.  5. Verify Output. Verify the completed kg files in the Know2BIO/dataset/know2bio_dataset directory. The combined knowledge graph will be in the file \u2018whole_kg.txt' which will be used for the RAG pipeline. The remaining steps in the repository README are not required for this analysis.\n45.  6. Move Knowledge Graph Results. Successful execution of this pipeline will result in 'whole_kg.txt' with over 6 million edges, see Table 3. Verify the number of lines in the file and move the file into the /data/text_corpus/ of the RUGGED directory using the below command or using the file explorer on your computer.\nmv PATH_TO_FOLDER/Know2BIO/dataset/know2bio/whole_kg.txt PATH_TO_FOLDER/RUGGED/data/knowledge_graph\n46.Construct a Combined Knowledge Graph. Steps 2.1 and 2.2 result in a knowledge graph from biomedical resources and high-level protein-disease relationships from text mining, respectively. This step integrates these data within a single unified knowledge graph.\n47.  1. Verify Results in RUGGED directory. Verify the knowledge graph construction result file (whole_kg.txt) and the text mining relationship results (merged_edge_list.tsv) are in the knowledge_graph directory within the data folder.\n48.  2. Iterate Results. Execute the provided combine_kg_results.py script to combine the text mining results within the knowledge graph results. This script will merge the extracted relationships and entities from both sources into a cohesive knowledge graph, ensuring the data is formatted consistently and integrated correctly. Below is an example command:\npython ./rugged/knowledge_graph/combine_kg_results.py --output_file ./data/knowledge_graph/rugged_knowledge_graph.txt ./data/knowledge_graph/whole_kg.txt ./knowledge_graph/merged_edge_list.tsv\n49.Filter Knowledge Graph. (Optional) This step samples a subset of the knowledge graph which will be used for the predictive analysis. This step is crucial for addressing technical limitations, as it filters out irrelevant data and reduces the graph size to execute the deep learning predictive analysis on limited computational resources.\n50.  1. Identify Relevant Nodes. Determine which biomedical entities are of interest for the predictive analysis in Step 3. This can be done by reviewing the knowledge graph to pinpoint relevant nodes. For this protocol example, we focus on disease nodes for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), represented by MeSH_Disease:D002312 and MeSH_Disease:D002311, respectively.\n51.  2. Filter Knowledge Graph. Use the filter.py script to tailor the knowledge graph for predictive analysis by focusing on specific subgraphs or diseases of interest. The script employs k-hop filtering from disease nodes of interest to include relevant entities and relationships: Example command below, filtering the graph reachable within 2 nodes from the selected disease nodes.\npython ./rugged/knowledge_graph/filter.py --k 2 --disease\n\"MeSH_Disease:D002312,MeSH_Disease:D002311\"\n--input_file ./data/knowledge_graph/rugged_knowledge_graph.txt --output_file ./data/knowledge_graph/filtered_k2_rugged_knowledge_graph.txt\nNOTE: Increasing the k-hop value expands the data scope within the graph for prediction analysis but also demands more computational resources. Adjust the k-hop value based on the available resources and the analysis complexity.\n52.Perform Explainable Prediction Analysis. In this step, we will use GNNExplainer38 on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to perform prediction analysis. The process involves splitting the filtered knowledge graph into training, validation, and test sets with an 85:5:10 ratio. This split allows us to evaluate the model's performance accurately. The goal is to predict potential edges (relationships) in the knowledge graph, providing insights into previously unknown associations.\n53.  1. Ensure the RUGGED Docker container is running. If the previous terminal window as closed, connect to the Docker container by using the below command:\ndocker exec --it rugged /bin/bash\nOnce connected to the Docker container, navigate to the RUGGED directory.\n54.  2. Determine the edge(s) to predict. Provide the edges as pairs of nodes in a .txt file (e.g., edges_to_predict.txt). The edges already existing in the knowledge graph will be filtered out from the predictions.\n55.  3. Run the prediction analysis script. Specifying the edges to predict and the input knowledge graph as command line arguments. Example command:\npython ./rugged/predictive_analysis/generate_explainable_prediction.py -p edges_to_predict.txt -i ./data/knowledge_graph/filtered_k2_rugged_knowledge_graph.txt -o output -n 5 -k 10\n-p edges_to_predict.txt: Path to the file containing edges to predict.\n-i filtered_k2_rugged_knowledge_graph.txt: Path to the input knowledge graph.\n-o output: Directory for output files.\n-n 5: Number of top predictions to output.\n-k 10: Number of top important edges to visualize.\n56.Verify results are in the output folder. Examine the model results in prediction_results.csv and examine the top n predictions within the output folder. Review the top n predictions in the output folder. For each prediction, a graph visualization and relative importance scores for the top k edges are provided. The visualizations illustrate the most pertinent edges contributing to each prediction.\n57.Move Predictive Analysis Results. Once satisfied with the predictive analysis results, move the results into the /data/predictions/ of the RUGGED directory.\nNOTE: Explainability Al prediction analysis enhances the interpretability of predictions but requires substantial computational resources and time. Steps 4.1 and 4.2 can be performed concurrently with Step 3.\n58.Hypothesis Generation\n59.Connect to the RUGGED Docker Container.\n60.  1. Ensure the RUGGED Docker container is running. If the previous terminal window was closed, connect to the Docker container by using the below command:\ndocker exec --it rugged /bin/bash\n61.  2. Navigate to the RUGGED directory. The remaining steps will be issued in this command line window and directory.\ncd/workspace/RUGGED\n62.  3. Verify the supporting services are running. For example, if using Ollama and Neo4j in Docker, ensure the containers are running by typing 'docker ps'. Repeating Step 1.7 to verify services are functioning properly and Step 1.8 to troubleshoot issues if they exist.\n63.Prepare RAG Data. This step sets up the knowledge graph and text corpus for retrieval. Knowledge graph and literature may be substituted with user defined data by following the format outlined in our GitHub repository (https://github.com/pinglab-utils/RUGGED/tree/main/data). Place the data into the data/knowledge_graph/ and data/text_corpus/ directories, respectively.\n64.  1. Ensure the text corpus is in the data/text_corpus/ directory from Step 2.1.6., the knowledge graph with text mining predictions file is located in the data/knowledge_graph/ directory from Step 2.3.3, and the prediction results are in data/predictions/ directory from Step 3.5.\n65.  2. Populate the Neo4j Graph Database. Execute the provided script to create the necessary nodes, edges, and node features. This will allow RUGGED to access the data:\npython ./neo4j/prepare_neo4j.py\n66.  3. Index the Text Corpus. Execute the provided script to index the text corpus. This script will chunk the text into sections of 1000 tokens and create a vector database using the BERT (cite) model to generate embeddings. This process enables RUGGED to retrieve relevant text documents based on user queries:\npython ./text/prepare_corpus.py\n67.  4. (Optional) Test Neo4j Database Retrieval. Send a test query to the Neo4j database to ensure it is populated correctly and can return expected results. Verify that the output matches the expected nodes and relationships in the database. Example command:\npython ./neo4j/test_neo4j_retrieval.py --query \"MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 5\"\n68.  5. (Optional) Test RAG Corpus Retrieval. Send a test query to the RAG text corpus to ensure the text retrieval system is working. Check that the retrieved documents are relevant to the query and that the embeddings are functioning as expected. Example command:\npython ./text/test_rag_retrieval.py --query \"example query text\"\n69.Explore Hypotheses with RUGGED. Start RUGGED in the command line interface to interact with the system and explore your hypotheses. Type the following command in your terminal:\npython rugged.py\n70.  1. Interact with RUGGED. Once the CLI is running, you can start querying the system to retrieve relevant information. Use natural language queries or specific commands to interact with the knowledge graph and text corpus. An example use case is presented in Figures 3, 4, and the full transcript is in the Supplementary Materials.\n71.  2. Query the Knowledge Graph. To extract specific information from the knowledge graph prepared in Step 2, pose your question in natural language, starting with the keyword \u201cquery\u201d. For example:\nquery \"What example of drug?\"\n72.  3. Explore Predictions. To explore link prediction analyses from Step 3, ask to search for a specific relationship, leading with the keyword \u201cpredict", "example": "npredict \"What are some new potential drug targets to treat ACM?\"\n73.  4. Literature Retrieval. To explore documents related to a specific biomedical topic from Step 2, pose the question in natural language, leading with the keyword \"search"}, {"example": "nsearch \"What literature supports the possibility that protein X is related to disease Y?\u201d\n74.  5. Iterate and Refine. Since RUGGED utilizes the chat-like capabilities of LLM models, user questions can be revised and refined in-context. Based on the initial results, refine your queries and continue exploring different hypotheses. Use the interactive capabilities of RUGGED to iteratively improve your understanding and gather more precise information.\n75.  6. Rerun Cypher Commands in Neo4j. (Optional) The knowledge graph query results will provide a Cypher command used to retrieve the information. You can rerun or modify this command by visiting the Neo4j browser interface from Step 1.7.4 (e.g., at http://localhost:7474). Paste and modify the Cypher commands as needed to refine your queries and gather more specific insights from your data.\n76.  7. Summarize Conversation. Review the retrieved information and summarize the conversation with RUGGED. Type the keyword \"summarize\u201d to output a summary of the interaction to a text file for later analysis. The full text response will be displayed in the terminal.\n77.  8. Review Chat Logs. For troubleshooting and reproducibility, full text of the interaction is accessible in the /log/ folder in RUGGED, including intermediate commands and conversations between LLM agents within RUGGED.\n78.Shutting Down and Restarting RUGGED.\n79.  1. Get Docker Container IDs. Use docker ps to list all running containers and obtain the container IDs for RUGGED, Neo4j, and Ollama.\ndocker ps\nFor all following commands, replace <container_id_for_rugged>, <container_id_for_neo4j>, and <container_id_for_ollama> with the actual container IDs.\n80.  2. Stop Docker Containers. Shut down RUGGED and the associated Docker containers using their container IDs.\ndocker stop <container_id_for_rugged>\ndocker stop <container_id_for_neo4j>\ndocker stop <container_id_for_ollama>\nNOTE: While shutting down your device will stop all Docker containers automatically, manually stopping these containers first is recommended to prevent potential data loss and ensure all processes close properly.\n81.  3. Restart Docker Containers. To restart the RUGGED system, use the container IDs to start the necessary Docker containers.\ndocker start <container_id_for_rugged>\ndocker start <container_id_for_neo4j>\ndocker start <container_id_for_ollama>\n82.  4. Reattach to Docker Network. If needed, use these commands to re-attach the containers to the network.\ndocker network connect rugged_network <container_id_for_rugged>\ndocker network connect rugged_network <container_id_for_neo4j>\ndocker network connect rugged_network <container_id_for_ollama>\n83.  5.

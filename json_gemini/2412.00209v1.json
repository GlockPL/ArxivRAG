These next-generation applications impose demanding performance requirements, including stringent quality of experience, low latency, and high reliability. Traditional wireless systems often fall short of meeting these diverse needs, creating a compelling case for the integration of DT technology [35]. DTs represent a sophisticated amalgamation of virtual models and real- world systems, with wireless communications serving as a fundamental enabler. The advent of advanced wireless tech- nologies, such as 5G and the forthcoming 6G, provides the necessary infrastructure to support the complex and data- intensive requirements of DTs. These technologies offer high- speed connectivity, reduced latency, and improved reliability, which are essential for the seamless operation of DTs. For instance, the ultra-low latency of 5G networks is particularly beneficial for applications requiring near-instantaneous data transmission, such as real-time monitoring and remote control of digital replicas [36].

DTs create accurate virtual replicas of physical assets and processes, enabling real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimization of industrial operations. This transformation is largely driven by industrial data offloading, which involves transferring vast amounts of industrial data from on-site machinery and sensors to centralized cloud platforms or edge devices for processing and analysis. This process not only alleviates the computational burden on local systems but also enhances data accessibility and analytical capabilities. In practice, data offloading within the DT framework allows industries to manage and process large datasets more efficiently [51]. By shifting the data processing load to more capable cloud or edge computing resources, local systems are freed from intensive computational tasks, leading to improved system performance and responsiveness. This is particularly important in industrial environments where timely and accurate data analysis is critical for maintaining operational continuity and efficiency. Furthermore, the integration of DTs with advanced industrial data offloading techniques ensures that industries can harness the full potential of big data and IIoT.

DTs, which create precise virtual replicas of physical assets, machines, and processes, enable real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimization of indus- trial operations. The fusion of ISAC into this ecosystem brings a new dimension to how industries manage and utilize their data, fostering a seamless and continuous flow of information between the physical and digital worlds [58]. ISAC enhances DT services by combining advanced sensing capabilities with robust communication technologies. This integration allows for the continuous and accurate transfer of industrial data from physical entities to their digital counterparts. Sensors embedded in machinery and equipment gather extensive real- time data on performance, condition, and environment. This data is then communicated instantly to the DTs, where it is processed and analyzed [59]. The result is a dynamic, real-time representation of the physical asset that can be used to predict failures, optimize performance, and schedule maintenance, thereby significantly reducing downtime and operational costs. The efficiency of industrial data offloading plays a critical role in this process. By leveraging ISAC, data collected by sensors is transferred to centralized cloud platforms or edge devices for processing and analysis [60]. This not only alleviates the computational burden on local systems but also ensures that the data is accessible for immediate analysis and action. The integration of ISAC with DTs means that large volumes of data can be managed more effectively, enabling industries to harness the full potential of big data and IIoT. Advanced analytical tools can process this data to uncover insights, op- timize processes, and enhance decision-making.

Content Caching", "content": "Content caching is a crucial service in modern industries, especially with the rise of IIoT devices and the advent of 6G networks. In industrial environments, where a vast array of IIoT sensors continuously generates industrial data, con- tent caching ensures that frequently accessed information is quickly retrievable without straining network resources [65]. For instance, in a smart manufacturing facility, real-time data from production machinery can be cached to provide imme- diate insights and enable rapid adjustments, reducing latency and improving operational efficiency [66]. Similarly, in 6G networks, which are designed to handle massive volumes of data with ultra-low latency, caching mechanisms help manage the high-speed data flow by storing and quickly accessing criti- cal information close to the edge of the network. This reduces the computational burden on central servers and minimizes the need for repeated data retrieval from distant sources. By optimizing data access speed and reducing both latency and network load, content caching enhances real-time decision- making and operational optimization, driving more responsive and efficient industrial processes [67]. DTs can significantly enhance industrial content caching services by providing a sophisticated framework for managing and utilizing real-time data in industrial settings. By creating accurate virtual replicas of physical assets, machines, processes, and systems, DTs enable dynamic and continuous updates that are crucial for effective content caching. For instance, DTs can monitor and analyze industrial data from IIoT sensors in real-time, identifying patterns and frequently accessed information that can be cached strategically. This predictive capability allows for preemptive caching of relevant data, reducing latency and ensuring that critical information is readily available when needed. In scenarios involving complex industrial processes or large-scale systems, DTs can optimize caching strategies by determining which data is most valuable for immediate access"}, {"title": "E. Resource Allocation", "content": "Resource allocation is a critical service in industries, directly impacting operational efficiency, cost management, and ser- vice quality. In industrial settings, effective resource allocation ensures that assets such as personnel, equipment, machines, and materials are optimally distributed to meet production demands, maintain service levels, and maximize profitabil- ity. Proper allocation involves not just assigning industrial resources to specific tasks but also balancing and optimizing their use to prevent bottlenecks, reduce downtime, and avoid waste. However, resource allocation presents several chal- lenges. Industries often face issues such as resource scarcity, where demand exceeds availability, leading to delays and increased operational costs [74]. Furthermore, dynamic and unpredictable environments, such as manufacturing floors or service operations, can result in fluctuating demands that com- plicate the allocation process. Inefficient industrial resource allocation can also lead to underutilization or overutilization of resources, causing imbalances that affect productivity and increase maintenance needs. Additionally, a lack of real-time data and visibility can hinder the ability to make informed allocation decisions, exacerbating these issues. DT technology offers a powerful solution to these challenges by providing a virtual replica of physical systems and processes [75]. By simulating real-world operations, DTs enable industries to monitor resource usage and performance in real time, allowing for more accurate and dynamic resource allocation. DTs can integrate industrial data from various sources, such as sensors, machines, and historical records, to create com- prehensive models that predict resource needs and identify potential issues before they arise [76]. For instance, in a manufacturing environment, a DT can model production lines and resource flows, providing insights into where resources are most needed and predicting when and where shortages might occur. This allows for proactive adjustments and optimization of industrial resource allocation. In service industries, DTs can track customer interactions and service demand patterns, facilitating better industrial scheduling and staffing decisions. Furthermore, DTs enable scenario planning and simulation, allowing industries to test different allocation strategies and assess their impact before implementation. This reduces the risk of making costly mistakes and ensures that industrial resources are allocated in the most efficient manner possible [77]. Overall, by leveraging DT technology, industries can enhance their resource allocation processes, improve opera- tional efficiency, and respond more effectively to dynamic and complex challenges.\nDTs can be a highly efficient approach to solve the afore- mentioned issues and improve industrial resource allocation even in the unpredictable network dynamics that compli- cate industrial resource supply and demand matching.

Virtual stores and showrooms allow customers to explore products in a 3D environment, try virtual fittings, and interact with digital sales representatives. This not only enhances customer engagement but also reduces the need for physical inventory and store space, leading to cost savings and a more sustainable business model. In training and education, the metaverse offers immersive learning envi- ronments where employees can undergo realistic simulations of complex procedures and scenarios. This approach improves training outcomes by providing hands-on experience in a risk- free setting, enhancing skills retention, and reducing train- ing costs. For example, medical professionals can practice surgeries using virtual simulations, while corporate teams can engage in virtual team-building exercises and workshops. Fur- thermore, the metaverse can revolutionize collaboration and remote work [98]. Virtual offices and meeting spaces enable teams to interact as if they were physically present, fostering better communication and collaboration across geographical boundaries. This not only enhances productivity but also supports flexible working arrangements and reduces travel- related expenses. However, metaverse in industrial settings presents several challenges, including managing the massive amounts of data generated by immersive simulations, ensur- ing real-time synchronization between virtual and physical environments, and maintaining system security and integrity [99]. The complexity of integrating diverse IIoT devices and sensors into a cohesive virtual model adds to these difficulties, potentially leading to data inconsistencies and inefficiencies.\nDT technology can manage these challenges by creating dynamic, virtual replicas of physical assets and processes. DTs enable real-time monitoring and simulation of indus- trial operations, providing accurate and synchronized virtual models that reflect the current state of physical systems. This helps in identifying discrepancies between the virtual and real worlds, optimizing resource allocation, and predicting potential issues before they impact operations. Additionally, DTs enhance security by allowing for continuous testing and validation of virtual environments against potential threats.

The introduction of new frameworks and methods demonstrates how DTs can streamline product development, offering real-time updates and continuous optimization across design, manufacturing, and service stages. However, the focus remains predominantly on physical data analysis, with virtual models often overlooked. To address this, the research in [104] presents a novel approach to product design utilizing DT technology, starting with a review of product design evolution. It then outlines and ex- amines the framework for DT-driven product design (DTPD), incorporating wireless communication to facilitate real-time interaction between physical products and their digital coun- terparts.

Traditional DTs provide deter- ministic feedback for behavior adjustments, which can limit their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an advanced concept called the Evolutionary DT (EDT). The EDT framework integrates supervised learning to create a more accurate virtual model of the physical world. This approach aims to enhance the adaptability and flexibility of industrial products by wirelessly exchanging data between physical assets and their digital twins, allowing for faster decision-making.

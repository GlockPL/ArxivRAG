Morphological factors such as size, location, texture, and variable appearance complicate tumor inspection. Medical imaging presents challenges, including noise and incomplete images. This research article presents a methodology for processing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, encompassing techniques for image classification and denoising. The effective use of MRI images allows medical professionals to detect brain disorders, including tumors. This research aims to categorize healthy brain tissue and brain tumors by analyzing the provided MRI data. Unlike alternative methods like Computed Tomography (CT), MRI technology offers a more detailed representation of internal anatomical components, making it a suitable option for studying data related to brain tumors. The MRI picture is first subjected to a denoising technique utilizing an Anisotropic diffusion filter. The dataset utilized for the model's creation is a publicly accessible and validated Brain Tumour Classification (MRI) database, comprising 3,264 brain MRI scans. SMOTE was employed for data augmentation and dataset balancing. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) such as ResNet152V2, VGG, ViT, and EfficientNet were employed for the classification procedure.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The brain and the spinal cord are combinedly known as the Central Nervous System, which is crucial for the control of numerous cellular functions. The functions include organization, analysis, decision-making, directive issuance, and information integration [1]. The human brain exhibits extraordinary complexity owing to its distinctive physical architecture. Conditions such as brain tumors, infections, migraines, and strokes are a small subset of central nervous system (CNS) disorders that present considerable challenges in the development, diagnosis, and assessment of successful treatment strategies, as noted in [3]. A significant difficulty for radiologists and neuropathologists is the early detection of brain tumors, which result from the aberrant proliferation of brain cells. The detection of cerebral malignancies by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an intricate manual procedure prone to inaccuracies. The abnormal proliferation of nerve cells, resulting in the creation of a mass, is termed a brain tumor. There are approximately 130 unique types of tumors that can arise in the brain and the central nervous system, encompassing both benign and malignant forms. The prevalence of various tumors differs, with some being exceptionally rare and others often observed [4]. Till date approximately 700,000 individuals in the United States are diagnosed with primary brain tumors. According to research cited in [5], patients between the ages of 55 and 64 had a 46.1% one-year survival rate, whereas patients between the ages of 65 and 74 had a 29.3% survival rate. Image segmentation is a technique used to divide a image into several segments, frequently employed in the medical imaging domain. The visual representation of a picture can be enhanced by extraction for analytical purposes. This transpires when the image is partitioned into multiple distinct segments. The scientific examination of images predominates in the field of medical diagnostics. The existence of nuanced differences, specific types of noise, and the absence of evidence concerning impediments in medical imaging complicates the resolution of this issue. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more advantageous than autonomous computed tomography (CT) equipment. It emits no radiation and hence has no adverse effects on the human body. The fundamental elements are the magnetic field and radio waves. It is a widely utilized non-invasive imaging modality that offers accurate distinction between tissues. The capability of MRI to normalize commonly affected tissue enhances the imaging of structures of interest in human brain tumors. Researchers have lately encountered a significant obstacle in the manual segmentation of brain MRI images [7]. Image segmentation has often been employed to identify brain tumors. Diverse methodologies necessitate a patient-specific training dataset to perform tailored MRI tumor imaging investigations.These types of datasets intensify the difficulties for specialists. And these solutions typically depend on alternate imaging modalities, such as T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images. Various research also shows the use of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation and balancing the dataset [20].\nThe rapid growth and unfavorable prognosis of brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas, represent a significant health threat. Despite advancements in MRI and CT imaging, nu-"}, {"title": "II.

The model demonstrates exceptional accuracy of 99.53% and achieves precision and recall rates of 100%, supported by Explainable AI methodologies such as LIME. Nevertheless, the dependence on a particular dataset and the restricted examination of real-world clinical variability may limit its generalizability.\nIn the research conducted by A. Rath, B. S. P. Mishra, and D. K. Bagal, [29] they uesd pretrained ResNet50 model to improve accuracy and efficency utilizing a balanced dataset of 2,577 MRI images having binary class of tumors and healthy instances of patients.\nA particular application, certain machine learning models demonstrate superior efficacy compared to others.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION", "content": "Deep-learning models are trained using preprocessed data and selected classes. This work employs ViT, ResNet152V2, VGG16, and EfficientNet. The confusion matrix and ROC curves are created to get optimal results and provide a visual representation. Next, the models are evaluated using several metrics.\nFig. 4 illustrates the ROC curves of four deep learning models (VGG16, EfficientNet, ResNet152V2, and ViT) utilized for brain tumor classification. Models exhibiting AUCs approaching 1.00 demonstrate elevated accuracy. ViT and EfficientNet attain impeccable performance (AUC 1.00), although VGG16 and ResNet152V2, exhibiting AUCs near 1.00, demonstrate robust classification with minor discrepancies, indicating greater challenges in differentiating tumor kinds.\nFig. 5 presents the confusion matrix, illustrating that EfficientNet shows exceptional classification performance across all tumor types, particularly in distinguishing glioma from non-tumor cases. The ViT and VGG16 also demonstrate strong performance, excelling particularly with meningioma tumors. ResNet152V2, however, struggles to differentiate glioma from the absence of a tumor, leading to the highest rate of misclassifications. While all models perform well, EfficientNet stands out with the highest precision but ViT and VGG16 exhibit difficulties in glioma classification. Conversely, ResNet152V2 requires further tuning due to its challenges in correctly classifying glioma and no-tumor cases.\nTable III evaluates the efficacy of four models (VGG16, EfficientNet, ResNet152V2, and ViT) using F1 scores and accuracy in the classification of brain tumors. EfficientNet surpasses all models, achieving the greatest F1 scores and an overall accuracy of 0.98, exemplifying the optimal equilibrium between precision and recall. VGG16 exhibits commendable performance, particularly for meningiomas and pituitary tumors, achieving an accuracy of 0.93. ResNet152V2 and ViT have comparable overall accuracies (0.91); nevertheless, their performance is somewhat inconsistent, especially in the glioma and no tumor categories. The ViT demonstrates superior performance in the classification of pituitary tumors.\nIn summary, EfficientNet is the most dependable and precise model, with VGG16 closely trailing behind. ResNet152V2 and ViT require enhancement for improved consistency.\nTable IV illustrates multiple brain tumor classification studies using machine learning and deep learning models, emphasizing this work's excellent results. The findings show that modern deep learning architectures outperform conventional methods and models. This study shows model performance improvements, with EfficientNet obtaining 0.98 accuracy.

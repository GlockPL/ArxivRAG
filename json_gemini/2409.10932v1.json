The prevailing development of quantum computing and machine learning (ML) technologies may bring practical improvement to the performance of CHD diagnosis. Quantum machine learning (QML) is receiving tremendous interest in various disciplines due to its higher performance and capabilities. A quantum leap in the healthcare industry will increase processing power and optimise multiple models. Techniques for QML have the potential to forecast cardiac disease and help in early detection. To predict the risk of coronary heart disease, a hybrid approach utilizing an ensemble machine learning model based on QML classifiers is presented in this paper. Our approach, with its unique ability to address multidimensional healthcare data, reassures the method's robustness by fusing quantum and classical ML algorithms in a multi-step inferential framework. The marked rise in heart disease and death rates impacts worldwide human health and the global economy. Reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality requires early detection of heart disease. In this research, a hybrid approach utilizes techniques with quantum computing capabilities to tackle complex problems that are not amenable to conventional machine learning algorithms and to minimize computational expenses. The proposed method has been developed in the Raspberry Pi 5 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform and tested on a broad dataset that integrates clinical and imaging data from patients suffering from CHD and healthy controls. Compared to classical machine learning models, the accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and specificity of the proposed hybrid QML model used with CHD are manifold higher.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Quantum computing and machine learning are two rapidly evolving fields that, when combined, can transform healthcare, particularly in early cardiac disease prediction. The Healthcare 4.0 brought about a shift in lifestyle that contributed to the development of heart-related diseases such as diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and physical inactivity. Heart disease was the cause of 18 million deaths in 2017, and by 2050, it is expected to account for almost 58 million fatalities [1]. An international concern is the rising frequency of cardiac deaths; according to WHO, 85% of cardiovascular patients reside in low or middle-income nations, and cardiovascular disorders account for 52% of deaths in wealthy nations [2]. Furthermore, it raises the chance of Alzheimer's disease, dementia, COVID-18, and cognitive dysfunction [3,4,5,6]. Early identification lowers the risk of these diseases, dramatically saves the heart disease-related death rate, and enhances the health budget. As a result, in recent decades, early diagnosis of cardiovascular illnesses has been a significant research challenge.\nEarly detection of coronary heart disease can significantly improve prognosis by enabling earlier intervention and management, which can reduce the risk of severe outcomes such as heart attacks and heart failure. S.P. Patro et al. [7] designed a heart disease prediction framework using five machine learning models with UCI Machine Repository. Hossain et al. [8] propose a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to identify cardiovascular diseases (CVD) from clinical data combined with feature engineering and explainable AI. Traditional diagnostic methods for CHD, such as stress tests, angiography, and blood tests, have sensitivity, specificity, and cost limitations. More accurate, reliable, and cost-effective tools are needed to enhance early detection and diagnosis. However, traditional ML and deep learning (DL) models for predicting heart disease often need help handling imbalanced datasets. Farah Mohammad et al. [9] developed a continuous wavelet transformation and CNN-based hybrid model for Heart Disease Prediction. Their WT-CNN uses RUSBoost-based data balancing and achieves an exceptional accuracy of 97.2% in predicting heart disease.\nS V Babu et al. [10] proposed a QuEML model for predicting heart diseases using the Kaggle data repository, which performed well in accuracy and computational time. Hybrid QML combines classical machine learning techniques with quantum computing to uncover patterns in data that traditional approaches might miss. This could lead to more precise and early detection methods for CHD. Quantum-enhanced machine learning is vital in sustaining patient-oriented attention to healthcare patrons. Yogesh Kumar et al. [11] presented a QML model of its significance in heart failure detection on a dataset of 14 attributes. They verified that QRF,\nQKNN, QDT, and QGNB are better than traditional ML algorithms in heart failure detection.\nHybrid QML techniques could enhance the ability to accurately predict individual risk profiles, allowing for more personalized and effective management strategies. On the other hand, traditional machine learning methods frequently have significant calculation times and little processing power. Quantum machine learning techniques have been created to address these deficiencies. Superposition and entanglement, two quantum mechanics concepts, are the foundation upon which the QML algorithms are built. An algorithm may assess many positions' impacts on the system response at once by considering the superposition characteristic. As a result, it dramatically reduces computing time. According to the entanglement characteristic, two particles are connected even when they are very far apart. As a result, QML algorithms are appropriate for large-scale or complicated issues and can significantly reduce computing time. This research suggests a hybrid approach using random forests and quantum neural networks to address the problem. Despite the widespread usage of QML algorithms and the critical relevance of early coronary artery disease prediction, only some methods currently employ QML algorithms for cardiovascular disease prediction."}, {"title": "Key Components of the Model:", "content": "1.

Literature Review", "content": "Most of the recent research uses a classic machine learning-based approach toward the early detection of coronary heart disease. This paper provides an overview and analysis of the machine learning classifiers used to diagnose chronic diseases, followed by their implementation and assessment. It illustrates the value of machine learning classifiers in the healthcare industry and how they can produce more accurate predictions. Decision trees, SVMs, random forests, and artificial neural networks are widely used, which are trained on data that includes patients' demographics, past medical history, and test results [12,13,14 ].\nOlawade et al. [15] and Burton et al. [16] illustrated the efficacy of deep learning algorithms for predicting coronary artery disease using echocardiography data while managing high accuracy related to non-invasive diagnostics. Researchers also use random forests and logistic regression models to estimate CHD based on risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, diabetes and other lifestyle parameters [17,18,19]. Most of them target feature selection methods indirectly to enhance the quality of a prediction with the most minor computational complexity. Since medical datasets are ever-increasing in their dimensionality and complexity, inefficiency regarding computation and interpretation by classical algorithms encourages exploration into quantum enhancement methodologies.\nQuantum computing has superior computational abilities and is fast gaining centre stage in machine learning; thus, it has a potential for using machine learning for intricate, high-dimensional data analyses. The quantum computer uses qubits, similar to the bits in classical computers, in that they can solve complicated problems and exchange information [20,21]. A few research works have started looking at applications of QML in health diagnostics, early cancer detection, and heart-related ailments. According to Sengupta et al. [22], quantum algorithms may significantly speed up the classification tasks related to medical diagnostics. Theoretically, QML outperforms classical algorithms in handling complex and multi-variable interactions from a large dataset, improving accuracy and model speed in disease prediction [23,24]. However, despite such potential, practical applications of pure QML in the healthcare domain remain in their infancy due to the present-day hardware limitations of quantum computers. The resultant development in this respect involves formulating hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models that would try to fill the gap between classical ML methodologies and quantum computing powers. Classical models are employed to perform feature extraction and pre-processing, whereas, for cases where computational tasks like optimization and large-scale pattern recognition need to be performed, quantum algorithms take over.\nRecent work has shown that such hybrid methods can be even more computationally efficient and accurate than both classical models purely and their pure quantum counterparts [25,26]. Suzuki et al. [27] examine QML models based on quantum support vector classification (QSVC) and regression (QSVR) using a quantum circuit simulator. The performance of QSVC models using 4 qubits of the trapped-ion quantum computer and QSVR models on the near-term quantum device. Rui Zhang et al. [28] demonstrate a QSVM based on the regularized Newton method (RN-QSVM), which achieves an exponential speed-up over the classical algorithm. Havl\u00ed\u010dek et al. [29] proposed a quantum-enhanced feature space for SVM: quantum kernel estimation. It realized a computational speedup in classification tasks compared to classical SVM. Decoodt P et al. [30] have explored hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for applications in cardiology. Their work demonstrates how it would be possible to embed quantum algorithms in DL models for medical image analysis in an auspicious manner to detect heart diseases. A recent study by Abdulsalam et al. [31] suggests that QML classifiers outperform classical ML classifiers in heart disease prediction. Furthermore, the investigation shows that the bagging ensemble learning method raises the quantum classifiers' prediction accuracy.\nThe proposed hybrid QML models leveraging both quantum algorithms and the techniques of well-established classical ML can, therefore, offer more accurate and faster predictions, even in complicated and noisy medical datasets. And with ongoing improvements in quantum hardware, hybrid models are expected to further increase in medical diagnostics. While most of the classical machine learning approaches already demonstrated significant advances in CHD detection, their integration with quantum computing showed a path toward further enhancement. The practical application remains in its infancy, with the development of quantum hardware and algorithms needed to develop hybrid methods in healthcare."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "Development and implementation of the quantum-based hybrid ML model for early prediction of cardiac diseases amidst Healthcare 4.0 are indeed complex and multivariate, considering the involvement of sophisticated technologies and methodologies. Advanced data analytics, real-time monitoring, and personalized medicine feature prominently in this era; a lot is expected from these novel computational paradigms. Indeed, the hybrid quantum-classical machine learning model is promising in predicting early cardiac disease by exploring both quantum computing and classical algorithms. Quantum computing lies on a different framework from classical computing. Due to superposition, qubits can be in all states simultaneously, while entanglement allows quantum computers to process founts of data much easier. In machine learning, the QSVM and QNN would see that they can substantially speed up over classical alternatives, particularly when the dimension becomes exceptionally high. Logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks are a few of the traditional ML models utilized in health care to predict various diseases, including cardiac conditions. Several of these models suffer from high-dimensional data and require increasing computational resources. Some critical limitations of these models, such as feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and optimization, can be overcome by combining quantum computing with the existing models. The authors introduce a study that merges quantum computing with classical techniques to grasp the strengths of both. The proposed hybrid model can be designed in the following sessions in the context of predicting cardiac disease."}, {"title": "3.1 Data Collection and Pre-Processing", "content": "The first step involves gathering data from diverse sources. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide comprehensive patient histories, demographic information, lab results, and medical imaging. Data from IoT devices, such as wearable technology, offers real-time monitoring of vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG readings. Additionally, genomic data sheds light on genetic predispositions to cardiac diseases, while lifestyle data including information on diet, exercise, and smoking habits-further enriches the dataset. Once collected, this data undergoes rigorous pre-processing. Initial steps include data cleaning to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and standardize formats. Missing values can be addressed using mean/median/mode imputation, interpolation, or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation. Outlier detection is performed using Z-Score calculations or the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and manage anomalies. The data is then normalized or scaled using techniques like Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Standardization, Robust Scaler, Logarithmic Transformation, or Box-Cox Transformation. Finally, relevant features are extracted to enhance the prediction of cardiac disease.\nZ-Score: Calculate $z = \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}$, where u is the mean and o is the standard deviation.

Conclusion", "content": "Quantum algorithms, such as quantum support vector machines and quantum neural networks, promise improved predictive accuracy by exploring extensive solution spaces and capturing intricate patterns that classical models might miss, facilitating earlier and more precise disease detection. Handling real-time data quickly supports dynamic decision-making and personalised care, enhancing patient outcomes and operational efficiency. The performance for early detection of coronary heart disease is best for the KNN-RF Ensemble and DT-RF Ensemble; KNN-RF is the best overall model, with the highest accuracy of 99.96% and a recall of 99.97%, making it very good at finding true positives with minimal false negatives, which is very important in medical diagnosis. It is also impressively performed by the AdaBoost-RF Ensemble and DT-RF Ensemble. It is only slightly worse than the KNN-RF ensemble and thus can be regarded as a feasible alternative for early detection tasks. As quantum technology advances, its integration into healthcare machine learning will drive transformative changes, unlocking new research possibilities, optimizing treatments, and setting new medical innovation and patient care standards. This research aims to develop and use a hybrid quantum machine-learning prediction model for chronic renal disease that prioritizes accuracy. To create a better model, we have examined the accuracy of the same dataset using several machine learning methods and compared their accuracy scores. This research uses cross-validation to solve the overfitting problem and achieve the highest accuracy when combining popular machine learning classifiers like decision trees, gradient boosting, Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes, and gradient boosting to create the best hybrid model."}]}

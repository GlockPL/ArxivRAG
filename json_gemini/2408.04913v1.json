Recent works have expanded this idea to knowledge base (KB) embeddings, which take into account not only facts but also conceptual knowledge, expressed as a TBox (Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto and Schockaert, 2018; Kulmanov et al., 2019; \u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020; Abboud et al., 2020; Mondal, Bhatia, and Mutharaju, 2021; Peng et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022; Pavlovic and Sallinger, 2023; Jackermeier, Chen, and Horrocks, 2024). Which theoretical properties are interesting for KB embeddings? Which embedding methods have these properties? How expressive is the ontology language considered? These are some of the relevant questions to better understand how embedding methods work and which properties they offer.\nOne of the challenges to study KB embeddings in a uniform way is that the methods differ not only in how they are defined but also in the ontology language and in the properties the authors consider. We focus on KBs that can be expressed in description logic (DL), and on region-based embedding methods, which usually come with a geometric-based semantics. Regarding the properties, a basic goal is to determine whether there is some kind of correspondence between classical models based on interpretations and geometric-based models created by the embedding methods. A simple kind of correspondence is whether the existence of a (geometric-based) model within the embedding method implies the KB is satisfiable, and vice-versa, whether the existence of a classical interpretation that satisfies a given KB implies the existence of a model within the embedding method. The former property is known as soundness (see, e.g., Xiong et al. (2022)) and we call the latter completeness. Such correspondence does not require, for example, that (i) axioms entailed by a given KB hold in the geometric-based model, or conversely, that (ii) axioms that hold in the geometric-based model are a consequence of the KB or (iii) are at least consistent with the KB. These properties strengthen the notion of completeness. We call Property (i) entailment closure, while Properties (ii) and (iii) correspond, respectively, to the notions of strong and weak faithfulness by \u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter (2020). We study two variants for (i)-(iii): one only requires the ability of an embedding method to produce a geometric-based model with the desired property, that is, whether such a model exists; and one where the property should hold as a guarantee, that is, in addition to ability, every model should have the property. In the KG literature, full expressiveness (Kazemi and Poole, 2018) means that, given any assignment of truth values for facts, there is an embedding model that separates true facts from false ones. We generalize this notion to include ontology languages. We study and formalize these different properties, proposing a theoretical framework for better understanding KB embeddings behaviour. Figure 1 illustrates the relationships between the properties. We also study recent KB embedding methods and investigate how they fit in the theoretical framework. Our study reveals that for many embedding methods, in particular those with an implementation, the theoretical properties stated in the literature do not hold or cannot be combined (e.g., an embedding method can be fully expressive and able to capture some patterns but not within the same model).\nWe provide basic definitions in Section 2 and present recent region-based embedding methods and their semantics in Section 3. In Section 4, we introduce embedding method properties and show how they relate. We also show that if the ontology language is finite (that is, only finitely many axioms exist in the language), which is a common assumption for KB embedding methods, then multiple properties become equivalent. In Section 5, we investigate whether the embedding methods of Section 3 fit into the theoretical framework of Section 4. We conclude in Section 6.

These sets are usually countably infinite in the DL literature (Baader et al., 2017) but often assumed to be finite in the KG and KB embedding literature (Abboud et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2022). An ABox $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set of concept and role assertions of the form $A(a)$ or $r(a, b)$ respectively, where $A \\in N_C$, $r \\in N_R$ and $a, b \\in N_I$. A TBox $\\mathcal{T}$ is a finite set of axioms whose form depends on the specific DL language. Syntax of common DL constructors and TBox axioms is given in Tables 1 and 2. In the KG embedding literature, (inference) patterns are often considered. Table 3 presents these patterns and their DL translation. We say that a DL language $\\mathcal{L}$ is finite if there are finitely many axioms expressible in $\\mathcal{L}$. A DL knowledge base $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{A}$ is the union of a TBox and an ABox.\nSemantics The semantics of DL KBs is given by interpretations. An interpretation $\\mathcal{I}$ is a pair $(\\Delta^\\mathcal{I}, .^\\mathcal{I})$ where the interpretation domain $\\Delta^\\mathcal{I}$ is a non-empty set and $.\\mathcal{I}$ is a function that maps each $a \\in N_I$ to some $a^\\mathcal{I} \\in \\Delta^\\mathcal{I}$, each $A \\in N_C$ to some $A^\\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\Delta^\\mathcal{I}$ and each $r \\in N_R$ to some $r^\\mathcal{I} \\subseteq \\Delta^\\mathcal{I} \\times \\Delta^\\mathcal{I}$. The function $.\\mathcal{I}$ is extended to complex concept and roles as explained in Table 1 and the satisfaction of TBox axioms and ABox assertions is defined by Table 2. An interpretation $\\mathcal{I}$ is a model of an ABox $\\mathcal{A}$ ($\\mathcal{I} \\models \\mathcal{A}$) if it satisfies every assertion in $\\mathcal{A}$; it is a model of a TBox $\\mathcal{T}$ ($\\mathcal{I} \\models \\mathcal{T}$) if it satisfies every axiom in $\\mathcal{T}$; and it is a model of a KB $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{A}$ if $\\mathcal{I} \\models \\mathcal{T}$ and $\\mathcal{I} \\models \\mathcal{A}$. A KB $\\mathcal{K}$ is satisfiable (or consistent) if it has a model. An axiom $\\alpha$ (being an ABox assertion or a TBox axiom) is consistent with a KB $\\mathcal{K}$ if $\\mathcal{K} \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}$ is satisfiable, and is entailed by $\\mathcal{K}$, written $\\mathcal{K} \\models \\alpha$, if $\\mathcal{I} \\models \\alpha$ for every model $\\mathcal{I}$ of $\\mathcal{K}$. The deductive closure of a KB $\\mathcal{K}$ is the (possibly infinite) set of all axioms entailed by $\\mathcal{K}$.\nABoxes as TBoxes Some KB embedding methods operate on the TBox only and encode the ABox into the TBox using nominals. Specifically, $A(a)$ is represented by $\\{a\\} \\subseteq A$ and $r(a, b)$ by $\\{a\\} \\subseteq \\exists r.\\{b\\}$.

Region-based embeddings come with a geometric-based semantics, but axioms' plausibility is also often evaluated using a scoring function, e.g., considering that an axiom is true if it gets a score above a threshold. This motivates the following definition of embedding semantics, which allows for considering various semantics for a given embedding.\nDefinition 2 (Embedding semantics). A semantics for an embedding method M is a function SM, which given an M-embedding E and a language L returns a function $S_M(E, L)$ that maps each sentence in the language L to 1 (meaning true) or 0 (meaning false).\nHere, we focus on region-based embedding methods and their geometric-based semantics, hence we only consider one semantics for each method. Also, we consider one language per method. Thus, we may omit S and L and write $E \\models_M \\alpha$ for $S_M(E, L)(\\alpha) = 1$ or $E \\not\\models_M \\alpha$ for $S_M(E, L)(\\alpha) = 0$.\nWe now briefly introduce the embedding methods we will consider in this paper, using the terminology and notation we introduced for embedding and semantics. Our focus is on KB embedding methods that can be applied to various DL languages but we also consider two KG embedding methods that are able to capture some patterns (cf. Table 3).\nConvex geometric models (Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto and Schockaert, 2018) This method applies to quasi-chained rules, which include in particular the description logic $\\mathcal{ELHI}$ in normal form (concept inclusions of the form $A \\sqsubseteq B$, $A_1 \\sqcap A_2 \\sqsubseteq B$, $\\exists r^{(-)}.A \\sqsubseteq B$ and $A \\sqsubseteq \\exists r^{(-)}.B$ with $A, A_i \\in N_C \\cup \\{\\top\\}$ and $B \\in N_C \\cup \\{\\perp\\}$ and role inclusions of the form $r \\sqsubseteq s^{(-)}$, where $s^{(-)}$ can be a role name or its inverse). Each $a \\in N_I$ is embedded as a vector $E(a) \\in R^d$, each $A \\in N_C$ as a convex region $E(A) \\subseteq R^d$, and each $r \\in N_R$ as a convex region $E(r) \\subseteq R^{2d}$. The semantics of this method for $\\mathcal{ELHI}$ is given by:\n*   $E \\models_{conv} A(a)$ iff $E(a) \\in E(A)$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} r(a, b)$ iff $E(a) \\oplus E(b) \\in E(r)$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} r \\sqsubseteq s^{(-)}$ iff $E(r) \\subseteq E(s^{(-)})$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} C \\sqsubseteq D$ iff $E(C) \\subseteq E(D)$;\nwhere the embedding function E is extended to complex concept and role expressions in $\\mathcal{ELHI}$ as follows (see (Bourgaux, Ozaki, and Pan, 2021) for a reference using a similar definition for a DL-Lite dialect):\n*   $E(\\perp) := \\emptyset$, $E(\\top) := R^d$;\n*   $E(r^-) := \\{x \\oplus y | x, y \\in R^d, y \\oplus x \\in E(r)\\}$;\n*   $E(A_1 \\sqcap A_2) := E(A_1) \\cap E(A_2)$; and\n*   $E(\\exists r^{(-)}.A) := \\{x | x \\in R^d, x \\oplus y \\in E(r^{(-)}), y \\in E(A)\\}$.\nAl-cone models (\u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020) Since in general the complement of a convex region may not be convex, when dealing with logics with negation, it is useful to consider convex regions which have a natural \"complementary region\" other than their actual complement. For this purpose, the authors of this method consider axis-aligned cones (al-cones), of the form $X_1 \\times \\dots \\times X_d$ with $X_i \\in \\{R, R^+, R^-, \\{0\\}\\}$. The method applies to (fragments of) $\\mathcal{ALC}$ (which allows for concept inclusions using the $\\sqsubseteq$, $\\sqcup$, $\\neg$, $\\exists$ and $\\forall$ constructors).

We say that M under $S_M$ is complete for $\\mathcal{L}$ if for every satisfiable KB $\\mathcal{K}$ in $\\mathcal{L}$, there is an M-model (under $S_M$) for $\\mathcal{K}$.\nExample 3. Corollary 1 in (Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto and Schockaert, 2018) states that embedding methods that produce convex geometric models are sound and complete for the language of quasi-chained rules (hence in particular for $\\mathcal{ELHI}$ in normal form), and Proposition 2 in (\u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020) states that methods that produce al-cones models are sound and complete for $\\mathcal{ALC}_p$.\nAs recalled in Example 2, embedding methods that produce convex geometric models are not complete for languages with role disjointness, under a semantics where role disjointness means disjointness of the role embeddings. Example 4 shows that BoxE (which does not fall into this class) is also incomplete for languages with role disjointness.\nExample 4. Consider the satisfiable KB $\\mathcal{K} = \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{A}$ with $\\mathcal{A} = \\{r(a,b), s(a, c), r(d, c), s(d,b)\\}$ and $\\mathcal{T} = \\{r \\subseteq \\neg s\\}$. Assume for a contradiction that there exists a BoxE-model E of $\\mathcal{K}$. Recall that E maps each role r to two boxes, one for the \"head\", denoted $r^{(1)}$, and one for the \"tail\", denoted $r^{(2)}$. Also, recall that each box $r^{(i)}$ is represented by its lower and upper corners, denoted $l_r^{(i)}$ and $up_r^{(i)}$ respectively. Moreover, a point $\\tilde{e}$ is in a box $r^{(i)}$ if it is between its lower and upper corners, in symbols, $l_r^{(i)} < \\tilde{e} < up_r^{(i)}$.\nSince $E \\models_{boxe} r \\subseteq \\neg s$, then $r^{(1)} \\cap s^{(1)} = \\emptyset$ or $r^{(2)} \\cap s^{(2)} = \\emptyset$. Assume $r^{(1)} \\cap s^{(1)} = \\emptyset$ (the argument for the case where $r^{(2)} \\cap s^{(2)} = \\emptyset$ is analogous). Given a vector v, denote by $v[j]$ the value of v at position k. As $r^{(1)} \\cap s^{(1)} = \\emptyset$, there is a dimension j such that\n$up_r^{(1)}[j] < l_s^{(1)}[j]$ or $up_s^{(1)}[j] < l_r^{(1)}[j]$.\nSuppose $up_r^{(1)}[j] < l_s^{(1)}[j]$. As $E \\models_{boxe} r(a,b)$ and $E \\models_{boxes}(a, c)$, it must be the case that\n$e_a[j] + b_b[j] < up_r^{(1)}[j] < l_s^{(1)}[j] < e_a[j] + b_c[j]$,\nwhich implies that $b_b[j] < b_c[j]$. Now, as $E \\models_{boxe} r(d, c)$ and $E \\models_{boxe} s(d,b)$, we obtain\n$e_d[j] + b_c[j] < u_r^{(1)}[j] < l_s^{(1)}[j] < e_d[j] + b_b[j]$,\nwhich implies that $b_c[j] < b_b[j]$, contradicting $b_b[j] < b_c[j]$. The case $up_s^{(1)}[j] < l_r^{(1)}[j]$ can be proved analogously.\nIn the literature, it is common to consider an alternative meaning for soundness, which intuitively links the existence of an embedding with loss 0 and KB satisfiability. A loss function associated with an embedding method M can be seen as a function loss that takes as input a KB K and an M-embedding E of K and returns a number.\nProperty 3 (Embedding method soundness based on loss). If M has a loss function loss, we say that M is sound for $\\mathcal{L}$ w.r.t. the loss function if the existence of an M-embedding E of a KB $\\mathcal{K}$ in $\\mathcal{L}$ such that $loss(\\mathcal{K}, E) = 0$ implies that $\\mathcal{K}$ is satisfiable.\nExample 5. Example 1 shows that ELEm is not sound. Moreover, it also shows that ELEm is not sound w.r.t. the loss function defined in (Kulmanov et al., 2019). If the margin parameter $\\gamma$ is equal to 0 since E(\\{a\\}) and E(A) have the same center that lies on the unity sphere and the same radius 0, the loss of the axiom $\\{a\\} \\subseteq A$ given by $max(0, ||c(\\{a\\}) - c(A)||+ \\rho(\\{a\\}) - \\rho(A) - \\gamma) + |||c(\\{a\\})||-1|+|||c(A)||-1||$ is equal to 0, and the loss of the axiom $A \\subseteq \\bot$ given by $\\rho(A)$ is equal to 0. Hence, $loss(\\mathcal{K}, E) = 0$. For Theorem 1 in (Kulmanov et al., 2019) to hold, $\\gamma$ should be strictly negative, rather than $\\leq 0$."}, {"title": "4.2 Entailment Closure and Faithfulness", "content": "Since M-models come with very few guarantees on what they assign to true besides the KB itself, additional properties can be required on the M-models.

The notions of weak and strong faithfulness have been proposed in the literature and address this issue.\nDefinition 5 (Weak faithfulness of an M-model (adapted from (\u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020))).

They distinguish the ability to capture a single pattern or to capture jointly several patterns (possibly of different kinds). Indeed, some methods are able to produce an embedding that captures a pattern but not multiple ones, even of the same type (Abboud et al., 2020, Table 1). It follows from the form of the patterns that all sets of patterns are satisfiable (if no facts need to be considered).\nDefinition 7 (Capturing patterns (adapted from (Abboud et al., 2020))).

Theorem 5.1 in Pavlovic and Sallinger (2023) shows that Expressive is fully ABox-expressive. It can be easily checked that ExpressivE is fully TBox-expressive for $\\mathcal{L}$ (see (Pavlovic and Sallinger, 2023, Theorem 5.2)). However, ExpressivE is not fully KB-expressive for this language because it is not complete for $\\mathcal{L}$ (see Example 2, which can be instantiated for ExpressivE since the hyper-parallelograms are convex).\nSome authors also consider knowledge injection (Benedikt et al., 2020), which broadly refers to the task of incorporating explicit (pre-defined) knowledge expressed as rules or constraints into a machine learning model. This can be achieved by constraining the training, the output, or the model itself with such patterns required to hold in the model. Abboud et al. (2020) establish that their embeddings can be modified so as to provably ensure that they satisfy some patterns (among a restricted class of patterns)."}, {"title": "4.4 Relationships Between Properties", "content": "We now briefly discuss the relationships between the properties, considering two cases: one for the general case (with possibly infinite languages) (Figure 1), and one for the special case of finite languages (Figure 3). For readability, we omit \u2713 KB Entailed, \u2200 Strong KB Faithfulness and \u2200 Weak KB Faithfulness since they are equivalent to the conjunction of the ABox and TBox versions of the properties (Proposition 2).

Since we consider KBs in normal form and finite sets N\u2081, Nc, and NR, all languages are finite so we only consider properties of Figure 3. This comparison is not intended to be used to claim that some embedding methods are better than others based on the number of properties they satisfy. Our goal here is only to better understand the theoretical properties of these methods. Indeed, recall that not all methods apply to the same languages, so they cannot be directly compared."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion and Perspectives", "content": "In this work, we examine recent region-based KB embedding methods through the lens of the properties of their geometric-based semantics. Our framework provides a common vocabulary and clarifies relationships between properties of KB embeddings ("}]}

Which embedding methods have these properties?\nHow expressive is the ontology language considered? These\nare some of the relevant questions to better understand how\nembedding methods work and which properties they offer.\nOne of the challenges to study KB embeddings in a uni-\nform way is that the methods differ not only in how they are\ndefined but also in the ontology language and in the properties\nthe authors consider. We focus on KBs that can be expressed\nin description logic (DL), and on region-based embedding\nmethods, which usually come with a geometric-based seman-\ntics. Regarding the properties, a basic goal is to determine\nwhether there is some kind of correspondence between clas-\nsical models based on interpretations and geometric-based\nmodels created by the embedding methods. A simple kind\nof correspondence is whether the existence of a (geometric-\nbased) model within the embedding method implies the KB is\nsatisfiable, and vice-versa, whether the existence of a classical\ninterpretation that satisfies a given KB implies the existence\nof a model within the embedding method. The former prop-\nerty is known as soundness (see, e.g., Xiong et al. (2022))\nand we call the latter completeness. Such correspondence\ndoes not require, for example, that (i) axioms entailed by a\ngiven KB hold in the geometric-based model, or conversely,\nthat (ii) axioms that hold in the geometric-based model are a\nconsequence of the KB or (iii) are at least consistent with the\nKB. These properties strengthen the notion of completeness.\nWe call Property (i) entailment closure, while Properties (ii)\nand (iii) correspond, respectively, to the notions of strong and\nweak faithfulness by \u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter (2020).\nWe study two variants for (i)-(iii): one only requires the abil-\nity of an embedding method to produce a geometric-based\nmodel with the desired property, that is, whether such a model\nexists; and one where the property should hold as a guarantee,\nthat is, in addition to ability, every model should have the\nproperty.

Region-based embeddings come with a geometric-\nbased semantics, but axioms' plausibility is also often evalu-\nated using a scoring function, e.g., considering that an axiom\nis true if it gets a score above a threshold. This motivates the\nfollowing definition of embedding semantics, which allows\nfor considering various semantics for a given embedding.\nDefinition 2 (Embedding semantics). A semantics for an\nembedding method M is a function SM, which given an M-\nembedding E and a language L returns a function $S_M(E, L)$\nthat maps each sentence in the language L to 1 (meaning\ntrue) or 0 (meaning false).\nHere, we focus on region-based embedding methods and\ntheir geometric-based semantics, hence we only consider one\nsemantics for each method. Also, we consider one language\nper method. Thus, we may omit S and L and write $E \\models_M \\alpha$\nfor $S_M(E, L)(\\alpha) = 1$ or $E \\not\\models_M \\alpha$ for $S_M(E, L)(\\alpha) = 0$.\nWe now briefly introduce the embedding methods we will\nconsider in this paper, using the terminology and notation we\nintroduced for embedding and semantics. Our focus is on\nKB embedding methods that can be applied to various DL\nlanguages but we also consider two KG embedding methods\nthat are able to capture some patterns (cf. Table 3).\nConvex geometric models (Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto and Schock-\naert, 2018) This method applies to quasi-chained rules,\nwhich include in particular the description logic $\\mathcal{ELHI}$\nin normal form (concept inclusions of the form $A \\sqsubseteq B,$\n$A_1 \\sqcap A_2 \\sqsubseteq B$, $\\exists r^{(-)}.A \\sqsubseteq B$ and $A \\sqsubseteq \\exists r^{(-)}.B$ with\n$A, A_i \\in N_C \\cup \\{T\\}$ and $B \\in N_C \\cup \\{\\perp\\}$ and role inclusions\nof the form $r \\sqsubseteq s^{(-)}$, where $s^{(-)}$ can be a role name or its\ninverse). Each $a \\in N_I$ is embedded as a vector $E(a) \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$,\neach $A \\in N_C$ as a convex region $E(A) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$, and each\n$r \\in N_R$ as a convex region $E(r) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{2d}$. The semantics of\nthis method for $\\mathcal{ELHI}$ is given by:\n*   $E \\models_{conv} A(a)$ iff $E(a) \\in E(A)$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} r(a, b)$ iff $E(a) \\oplus E(b) \\in E(r)$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} r \\sqsubseteq s^{(-)}$ iff $E(r) \\subseteq E(s^{(-)})$;\n*   $E \\models_{conv} C \\sqsubseteq D$ iff $E(C) \\subseteq E(D)$;\nwhere the embedding function E is extended to complex\nconcept and role expressions in $\\mathcal{ELHI}^{\\bot}$ as follows (see\n(Bourgaux, Ozaki, and Pan, 2021) for a reference using a\nsimilar definition for a DL-Lite dialect):\n*   $E(\\perp) := \\emptyset, E(T) := \\mathbb{R}^d$;\n*   $E(r^-) := \\{x \\oplus \\tilde{y} \\mid x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, y \\oplus x \\in E(r)\\}$;\n*   $E(A_1 \\sqcap A_2) := E(A_1) \\cap E(A_2)$; and\n*   $E(\\exists r^{(-)}.A) := \\{x \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d, x \\oplus y \\in E(r^{(-)}), y \\in\nE(A)\\}$.\nAl-cone models (\u00d6z\u00e7ep, Leemhuis, and Wolter, 2020)\nSince in general the complement of a convex region may\nnot be convex, when dealing with logics with negation, it\nis useful to consider convex regions which have a natural\n\"complementary region\" other than their actual complement.\nFor this purpose, the authors of this method consider axis-\naligned cones (al-cones), of the form $X_1 \\times \\ldots \\times X_d$ with\n$X_i \\in \\{\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R}^+, \\mathbb{R}^-, \\{0\\}\\}$. The method applies to (fragments\nof) $\\mathcal{ALC}$ (which allows for concept inclusions using the $\\sqsubseteq,$\n$\\sqcap, \\sqcup, \\neg, \\exists$ and $\\forall$ constructors).

In particular, while several theoretical\nproperties have been considered relevant, such as those re-\nlated to faithfulness, in practice, there are no implementations\nthat satisfy them. Hence a novel practical embedding method\nthat would satisfy, e.g., soundness and completeness would\nalready offer more theoretical guarantees than existing ones.\nThe main difficulties encountered for fulfilling the properties\nare related to the ability of representing role disjointness (to-\ngether with facts!) and the bottom concept. This calls for\nsome research effort since many natural constraints involve\nthese constructs. For example, Wikidata has hundreds of\n\"conflict with\" constraints, which correspond to disjointness\naxioms between (complex) DL concepts.\nRecent works in the KG literature focus on query answer-\ning, where the task is not only to rank facts but expressions\nin a richer query language (Hamilton et al., 2018; Ren and\nLeskovec, 2020; Ren, Hu, and Leskovec, 2020; Zhang et\nal., 2021; Bai et al., 2023).

Let T be an L-TBox, A an ABox and E an\nM-model of K = T \u222a A.

Suppose that E is a TBox-entailed and strongly TBox-\nfaithful M-model of K = T\u222aA, and a is a TBox axiom.\nThen K |= a implies that SM (E, L)(a) = 1 as E is TBox-\nentailed. Conversely, SM (E, L)(a) = 1 implies that K |= a\nby strong TBox-faithfulness.\nSimilarly, if E is an ABox-entailed and strongly ABox-\nfaithful M-model of K, and a is an assertion, then K |= a\nimplies SM(E,L)(a) = 1 as E is ABox-entailed and\nSM(E, L)(a) = 1 implies that K |= a by strong ABox-\nfaithfulness.\nProposition 2. If M is guaranteed to be both strongly (resp.\nweakly) TBox-faithful and strongly (resp. weakly) ABox-\nfaithful for L then it is guaranteed to be strongly (resp.\nweakly) KB-faithful for L. The same holds when considering\nthe entailment closure guarantee property.\nProof. Let M be an embedding method that is guaranteed to\nbe both strongly (resp. weakly) ABox-faithful and strongly\n(resp. weakly) TBox-faithful. Let K be a satisfiable L-KB\nand E an M-model of K. By assumption, E is both strongly\n(resp. weakly) ABox-faithful and strongly (resp. weakly)\nTBox-faithful so by Definition 6 (resp. Definition 5), E is\nstrongly (resp. weakly) KB-faithful.\nSuppose that M is both guaranteed to be ABox-entailed\nand TBox-entailed. Let K be a satisfiable L-KB and E an\nM-model of K. By assumption, E is both TBox-entailed and\nABox-entailed so by Definition 4, E is KB-entailed.\nProposition 3. M under SM is fully ABox-expressive iff for\nany ABox A there is an M-model E of A interpreted under\nSM that is strongly ABox-faithful.\nProof. Let L be the language of assertions. Assume for any\nA there is an M-embedding E interpreted under SM that is\na strongly ABox-faithful M-model of A. Let AT and AF be\ntwo disjoint sets of true and false facts respectively and let\nE be a strongly ABox-faithful M-model of AT. Since E is\nan M-model, if a \u2208 AT then SM(E, L)(a) = 1. By strong\nABox-faithfulness, if SM (E, L)(a) = 1 then a is entailed\nby AT, i.e., a \u2208 AT. This means that SM(E, L)(a) = 1 iff\na \u2208 AT. Thus, for every true fact a \u2208 AT, SM(E, L)(a) =\n1 and for every false fact a \u2208 AF, SM(E, L)(a) = 0. It\nfollows that M under SM is fully ABox-expressive.\nConversely assume M under SM is fully ABox-expressive\nand let A be an ABox. Consider A as the set of true facts\nand L \\ A (recall that L is the set of all assertions, which\nis finite since NC, NR and NI are finite) as the set of false\nfacts.

It\nfollows that E is an M-model of A that is strongly ABox-\nfaithful (since there is no TBox).\nProposition 4. If L is a language of patterns, then M is\nable to capture exactly and exclusively L iff for any finite set\nof patterns S expressed in L, there exists a strongly TBox-\nfaithful M-model of S.\nProof. Let S be a set of patterns expressed in L and let\nE be an M-embedding.

The semantics of BoxEL is based on a standard DL in-\nterpretation IE built from the embedding E, so that whenever\nE is a BoxEL-model of a KB K then IE |= K as well.\nProposition 23 (Absence of completeness, faithfulness, en-\ntailment closure, full KB-expressiveness). For EL$\\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\perp$ in\nnormal form, BoxEL is not complete.\nHence (by Theorem 2), it is not able (nor guaranteed) to\nbe weakly or strongly KB-, TBox- or ABox-faithful, it is not\nable (nor guaranteed) to be KB-, TBox- or ABox-entailed,\nand it is not fully KB-expressive.\nProof. Consider the ABox\nA = {r(a, b), r(a, c), B(b), C(c)}\ntogether with the TBox T = {B \u2229 C \u2286 \u22a5} and set\nK = T\u222aA. Suppose for contradiction that E is a\nBoxEL-embedding of K. We have that E gives rise to\na geometric interpretation IE with domain \u2206IE . Hence\nwe have $(a^{IE},b^{IE}), (a^{IE},c^{IE}) \\in r^{IE}$ which means that\nTr(E(a)) = E(b) and Tr(E(a)) = E(c). It follows\nthat E(b) = E(c). However, we also have that E(b) \u2208\nBox(B), E(c) \u2208 Box(C) with Box(B) \u2229 Box(C) = \u2205,\nwhich implies that E(b) \u0338= E(c); a contradiction."}, {"title": "B.5 Properties of Box2EL"}]}

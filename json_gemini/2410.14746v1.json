{"title": "Accounting for Sycophancy in Language Model Uncertainty Estimation", "authors": ["Anthony Sicilia", "Mert Inan", "Malihe Alikhani"], "abstract": "Effective human-machine collaboration requires machine learning models to externalize uncertainty, so users can reflect and intervene when necessary. For language models, these representations of uncertainty may be impacted by sycophancy bias: proclivity to agree with users, even if they are wrong. For instance, models may be over-confident in (incorrect) problem solutions suggested by a user. We study the relationship between sycophancy and uncertainty estimation for the first time. We propose a generalization of the definition of sycophancy bias to measure downstream impacts on uncertainty estimation, and also propose a new algorithm (SyRoUP) to account for sycophancy in the uncertainty estimation process. Unlike previous works on sycophancy, we study a broad array of user behaviors, varying both correctness and confidence of user suggestions to see how model answers (and their certainty) change. Our experiments across conversation forecasting and question-answering tasks show that user confidence plays a critical role in modulating the effects of sycophancy, and that SyRoUP can better predict these effects. From these results, we argue that externalizing both model and user uncertainty can help to mitigate the impacts of sycophancy bias.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Externalizing the uncertainty of machine learning systems is critical for human-machine collaboration (Stowers et al., 2016; V\u00f6ssing et al., 2022). Estimates of system uncertainty can be communicated to human users to enable reflection, scrutiny, and intervention that prevents failure in critical applications. For instance, uncertainty estimates are used to detect failure modes in machine-aided medical diagnosis and self-driving cars (Guo et al., 2017). A common failure mode for modern dialogue-based systems (using language models) comes from sycophancy: proclivity to agree with users, even when they are wrong. This behavior presents a new technological echo chamber, where confirmation of a user's false beliefs can impact not only broad social discourse (Bleick et al., 2024), but also basic task-success when users employ these systems as collaborative problem-solving tools (Turpin et al., 2024). While sycophancy directly impacts the accuracy of such systems, it's unclear how sycophancy impacts the uncertainty estimates externalized by these systems. This paper aims to fill this gap.\nAlthough uncertainty estimation is in fact aimed at identifying failure modes such as sycophancy, estimates of language model uncertainty are typically based on derivatives from the model answer, so it's not clear whether answer biases caused by sycophancy can propagate to impact uncertainty estimates. To study this, we propose an extension to existing uncertainty evaluation frameworks, where rather than prompt a model and estimate uncertainty for its answer \u2013 we prompt the model, provide a suggested answer, and estimate uncertainty for the model's final proposal. To measure the impacts of sycophancy in this setting, we generalize existing notions of sycophancy bias in \u00a7 3.1, quantifying differences in uncertainty estimation with/without user suggested answers.\nFor these user suggestions, existing studies of sycophancy tend to focus on relatively simple user models, which make suggestions at random (Turpin et al., 2024). In \u00a7 3.2, we observe uncertainty estimation can be impacted by not only the presence of suggestions, but also their manner and semantics. For instance, users themselves can impart different confidence in their suggestions and be more or less correct in their assertions. We study these variables to determine how diverse behaviors in a user population exacerbate the impacts of sycophancy. We fluctuate user behaviors to study trends of impact on uncertainty estimation as well as more traditionally measured impacts (i.e., on accuracy).\nIn addition to analysis, our experimental framework allows us to evaluate new uncertainty estimation methodology that accounts for model sycophancy, for the first time. Specifically, in \u00a7 3.3, we propose a simple (but effective) modification to the common Platt Scaling algorithm (Platt et al., 1999), which is a key component to uncertainty estimation pipelines for language models (Guo et al., 2017; Kadavath et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023). Our modification conditions the scaling procedure on categorical descriptions of user behaviors (i.e., like whether and how users make suggestions). This provides a general procedure that produces more accurate uncertainty estimates by accounting for the collaborative nature of our experimental setting.\nIn summary, our contributions target the following key research questions:\n1.  How does sycophancy impact language model uncertainty estimates?\n2.  How do diverse user behaviors modulate or exacerbate the impacts of sycophancy?\n3.  How can we effectively model sycophancy to improve uncertainty estimation?\nOur results in \u00a7 4 suggest the impacts of sycophancy can be mitigated when both models and users externalize uncertainty. Our new algorithm - SyRoUP, \u00a7 3.3 \u2013 specifically takes both uncertainties into account to more accurately forecast model errors."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Uncertainty Estimation (UE)", "content": "Objective and Evaluation We assume a setting where a model (and user) are faced with a problem statement q that has some ground-truth answer a*. Example problem domains are given in \u00a7 2.2. In uncertainty estimation, the goal is to predict probability of correctness for the question q, given a model answer a. Commonly, uncertainty estimates are evaluated as probabilistic classifiers (Kadavath et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Sicilia et al., 2024), which accounts for the interpretation of the estimate as a signal of model confidence (Guo et al., 2017). In this setting, an estimate Pqa for the probability of correctness is evaluated by a proper scoring rule (Br\u00f6cker, 2009), which ranks estimates based on how well they match the true probability of correctness. Among these, we use the Brier Score, averaged over questions:\n$BS_{qa} = (P_{qa} - ACC_{qa})^2$ (1)\nwhere ACCqa is a binary indicator of model correctness. Since squared probabilities are not easy to interpret, we also report the Brier Skill Score:\n$BSS = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{q,a} BS_{qa}}{\\sum_{q,a} (\\mu - ACC_{qa})^2}$ (2)\nwhere \u03bc is the average accuracy. Brier Score represents a mean squared error for the probability estimate Pqa in predicting correctness, while Brier Skill Score represents a percent of variance in correctness explained by the prediction Pqa. It measures the information gain of the uncertainty estimate (relative to \u03bc) as a predictor for correctness.\nMethodology Methods for language model uncertainty estimation tend to follow a consistent format (Guo et al., 2017; Kadavath et al., 2022; Mielke et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023):\n1.  collect derivatives from the model, which correlate with answer uncertainty; then,\n2.  transform the value of the derivative to an actual probability of correctness.\nGiven a floating point model derivative \u017dga, Platt Scaling (Platt et al., 1999) provides an effective strategy to produce an estimate Pqa. It assumes\n$\\text{log} \\frac{P_{qa}}{1 - P_{qa}} = \\alpha Z_{qa} + \\beta$ (3)\nselecting parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 using MLE with a small amount of data (e.g., n < 100). Sicilia et al. (2024) show this strategy generalizes (or beats) other similar estimation techniques for language models."}, {"title": "Common Model Derivatives", "content": "We focus on two fairly common model derivatives, specific to language models (Lin et al., 2022; Kadavath et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023; Sicilia et al., 2024).\n1.  Direct Numerical Confidence (DNC) is directly sampled from the model's answer tokens. This requires a prompt that induces representations of confidence in the model's answer (e.g., \"Rate how confident you are in your answer on a scale from 1 to 10\"). It can also alter the model's answer distribution, and we explore this possibility in \u00a7 4.\n2.  Implicit Token Probability (ITP) is instead derived from the total probability a model assigns to the tokens in its answer; i.e., the probability of the sampled model answer, conditional to the question. This is an internal representation of model confidence and can be used independent of whether the model is prompted to consider confidence, as in DNC. We consider ITP for both standard prompts (see \u00a7 2.2 and \u00a7 A) as well prompts that elicit confidence estimates directly (ITP-D).\nOther potential model derivatives are based on model embedding (Ren et al., 2022), semantic clustering (Kuhn et al., 2022), ensembles (Malinin and Gales, 2020), and different aggregations of token probability (Fomicheva et al., 2020). The methods we study are cheap (computationally) and often more effective (Fadeeva et al., 2023). They can be directly interpreted as a probability, but we take logarithms and Platt Scale for improved accuracy."}, {"title": "2.2 Problem Domains", "content": "Question Answering We consider a range of factual question-answering problems, which are often based directly in logical reasoning or require reasoning indirectly. We consider two corpora.\n\u2022  BBH is a subset of the BIG Bench dataset (Srivastava et al., 2023) proposed by Suzgun et al. (2023). We use 25 domains spanning logical deduction, object tracking, movie recommendation, and more, which are explicitly selected from BIG Bench because they are more difficult.\n\u2022  MMLUPro is an expansion of the common MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020) proposed by Wang et al. (2024). It includes 14 domains spanning STEM and liberal arts. It increases difficulty compared to MMLU by adding more distraction (e.g., 10 choices per question) and problems where solutions require reasoning. For both datasets, we use all data from each domain (3,900 questions total). Prompts, answer parsing, and other dataset-specific details are in \u00a7 A.\nConversation Forecasting In forecasting, the goal is to predict the outcome of an unfolding conversation, such as whether a deal will occur at the end of negotiation. Although the model observes incomplete conversations, in reality, each dialogue is associated with a ground-truth outcome, indicating what actually occurred in the full exchange. We consider four corpora from the affective split of the FortunDial benchmark (Sicilia et al., 2024). Outcomes in this split all depend on the internal emotional states of interlocutors, as well as future events, creating inherent randomness. They cannot be perfectly determined from the partial conversations alone. Conversations span collaborative negotiations, competitive negotiations, and persuasive dialogues. They are collected from sources like Reddit (Chang et al., 2019), Wikipedia's talk page (Zhang et al., 2018), and crowd-worker platforms (Wang et al., 2019; Chawla et al., 2021a). We use equal random subsets from each corpus (800 questions total). Practically speaking, conversation forecasting is a long-standing and well-studied problem that is useful for social media moderation, healthcare, and general task-oriented dialogue (Walker et al., 2000; Reitter and Moore, 2007; Cao et al., 2019; Kementchedjhieva and S\u00f8gaard, 2021; Altarawneh et al., 2023).\nTypes of Uncertainty In the question-answering corpora, answers are deterministic. They are based in knowledge consensus and logic, which are assumed to be fixed. All uncertainty about the correctness of answers stems from the model; e.g., due to lack of training data. This type of uncertainty is epistemic (Lahlou et al., 2022). On the other hand, we select the conversation forecasting task because it introduces an additional form of uncertainty, which is inherent to the data. Given a partial conversation, the eventual outcome is not always the only plausible outcome. Instead, there is inherent randomness caused by future events and internal emotional states that are not perfectly predictable from the conversation alone. This uncertainty is aleatoric (H\u00fcllermeier and Waegeman, 2021). We hypothesize this distinction can impact sycophancy, and discuss this in our experiments. We focus on the more complex setting of conversation forecasting (containing aleatoric uncertainty), but make regular comparisons to the setting where epistemic uncertainty is isolated (question-answering)."}, {"title": "3 Proposed Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Inducing Sycophancy in UE Evaluation", "content": "Sycophancy Bias In settings with ground truth, sycophancy is generally measured by how a model changes its answers when provided with user suggestions. Of particular interest is the case where the model changes its answer from correct to incorrect, given an incorrect user suggestion (Wei et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2024). Consider a random question Q and user suggestion U. Let A U be an answer sampled from the language model with suggestion U in the question prompt. Let A be an answer without U in the prompt. Existing work on sycophancy measures the following expected difference (Turpin et al., 2024):\nACC Bias = E[ACCQA] \u2013 E[ACCQAU]. (4)\nThe user suggestion U is typically a fixed string; i.e., \"I think the answer is x, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts\" where x is randomly drawn from the list of possible answers.\nImpact of Sycophancy on UE To study the impact of sycophancy on uncertainty estimation, we generalize current definitions of sycophancy bias. Specifically, we can isolate the key aspects which make Eq. (4) a proper measure of bias, and use these to define an extension. We use the formalization of language model bias provided by Sicilia and Alikhani (2023), who define bias by change in a score for the language model answers, sampled conditional to a consistent distribution of questions. In particular, change is measured as a protected attribute is varied. In context of Eq (4), the signal ACC is the score and the presence of the user suggestion U is the protected attribute. Thus, a natural approach is to replace the scoring function, substituting the signal ACC with BS:\nBS Bias = E[BSQA] \u2013 E[BSQAU]. (5)\nThis measures change in uncertainty estimation performance for the model, caused by introducing the suggestion U. The user suggestion will change the model derivatives (\u00a7 2) but other aspects of methodology (e.g., Platt scaling function) should be held constant to isolate impact on model derivatives."}, {"title": "3.2 Evaluating Diverse User Suggestions", "content": "The other key aspect of bias is the protected attribute: presence of the user suggestion U. In context of uncertainty estimation, many aspects of the user suggestion can potentially impact bias. To capture this, we propose three new parameters to modify the distribution of user suggestions.\nConfidence Similar to model answers, users themselves can specify confidence in their suggestion. We can simulate this by manually appending the following to a user suggestion: \u201cI am about z% sure I am correct.\" We consider low confidence suggestions (z = 20), high confidence suggestions (z = 80), and null confidence suggestions (the absence of any confidence signal). Because adding signals of confidence changes the prompt, it directly changes the model's answer distribution. So, user confidence can impact the model derivatives used in uncertainty estimation (which are based on the answer distribution). For instance, we might expect higher model confidence when an answer agrees with a high confidence user suggestion. As the answer distribution changes, the accuracy ACC can also change, e.g., from correct to incorrect. This impacts the ground-truth used to evaluate uncertainty estimates, as well.\nCorrectness We can also vary the probability that a user suggestion is correct across prompts. Similar to confidence estimates (above), varying correctness changes the model's answer distribution, it's uncertainty estimates, and (potentially) the ground-truth used in evaluation. To efficiently study how user correctness impacts bias, we prompt models twice for each question (and setting of user confidence): once with a correct suggestion and once with a random incorrect suggestion. We then vary correctness percentage in the distribution of user suggestions by randomly down sampling one (or both) subsets of prompt/answer pairs. For instance, to achieve 66% user correctness, we can down sample 50% of the prompt/answer pairs with incorrect user suggestions, keeping all the pairs with correct user suggestions. For uncertainty estimation, we also ensure there is no train/test overlap among the questions Q used to learn the Platt scaling parameters.\nCalibration User signals of confidence may or may not match the true average correctness of the user. For instance, the user may actually be 50% correct when they claim they are 80% confident about correctness. This is an issue of calibration, which can be evaluated identically to model uncertainty estimates (i.e., using Brier Score). We consider calibrated users whose confidence estimates have minimal Brier Score as well as non-calibrated users whose confidence estimates have a larger Brier Score. Given our limited confidence vocabulary, the smallest possible Brier Score for the users is 16%, achieved by down sampling, so users are z% correct when they say they are \"z% sure.\" For instance, we can down sample such that 20% of user suggestions assigned low confidence are in fact correct. The larger score is 18% in our experiments, because we use the default correctness of 50% for non-calibrated users, independent of the confidence level they specify in the prompt."}, {"title": "3.3 SyRoUP: Sycophancy-Robust Uncertainty Estimates via Platt Scaling", "content": "The tools discussed so far allow us to measure the impacts of sycophancy on UE methods, but don't propose any means to account for sycophancy and mitigate potential biases. We propose an extension of Platt scaling, which is easy to implement in practice. Suppose u is a one-hot vector that categorizes different user behaviors. For instance, given the proposed behaviors, we can set u\u2081 = 1 whenever\n\u2022  i = 0, user doesn't provide suggestion;\n\u2022  i = 1, user gives null confidence suggestion;\n\u2022  i = 2, user gives low confidence suggestion;\n\u2022  i = 3, user gives high confidence suggestion;\nand set u\u2081 = 0, otherwise. We propose to modify Eq. (3) in the following manner:\n$\\log \\frac{P_{qa}}{1 - P_{qa}} = \\alpha Z_{qa} + \\gamma^T u + u^T \\Omega Z_{qa} u + \\beta$ (6)\nwhere each \u03b3i is a parameter vector. Effectively, this conditions the learned uncertainty estimate on the user behaviors categorized by u, instead of only the model derivative \u017dga. Thus, we can account for any biases in model derivatives triggered by these user behaviors; e.g., sycophancy. We call this method SyROUP (Sycophancy-Robust Uncertainty Estimation through Platt Scaling), pronounced like the breakfast condiment \"syrup.\""}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Next, we address our research questions. Prompts, models, and optimization details are in \u00a7 A."}, {"title": "4.1 How Does Sycophancy Impact Language Model Uncertainty Estimates?", "content": "Uncertainty estimates tend to be more accurate when users make suggestions."}, {"title": "4.2 How Do Diverse User Behaviors Modify the Impacts of Sycophancy?", "content": "1)  As user correctness increases, models also become more correct. The magnitude of this bias is dependent on domain.\nThe correlation between user correctness and model correctness (given a user suggestion) echoes existing claims of sycophancy in the literature (Wei et al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2023). In collaborative settings (where users may provide suggestions), the proclivity of language models to agree with users reduces their utility, since these models tend to provide correct answers when users are already correct. An interesting additional insight is that this sycophancy bias is stronger in conversation forecasting than question answering. We suspect this is again caused by an increase in types of uncertainty in forecasting (specifically, the presence of aleatoric uncertainty).\n2)  Depending on domain, some models respond to user confidence, exhibiting lower accuracy bias when users hedge.\nThe observation that certain models respond to user hedging is promising. Indeed, when users indicate they are not very confident, it's appropriate (and perhaps desired) for language models to discount these suggestions in preference of their own outputs. The result also indicates that hedging behaviors (on the user side) may help to mitigate sycophancy bias. Important caveats are that models still demonstrate considerable bias in the presence of hedging language and that smaller models (like Mistral 7B) may not be sensitive to hedging.\n3)  User confidence correlates with uncertainty estimation performance, specifically when user confidence is calibrated.\nIdeally, performance at UE would not be correlated with user confidence. The fact that it is correlated means users must modulate their trust in UE methods, depending on their own confidence. For instance, consider our previous result, which indicates that user hedging can be valuable for mitigating sycophancy. Since users will experience worse UE when expressing low confidence to language models, the value is no longer clear. In the next section, we discuss ways to improve uncertainty estimation, so it accounts for diverse differences in user suggestions.\n4)  Impact of user suggestion (on model answers) is not easily identified by annotators; showing model confidence helps.\nHuman annotation results indicate that model chain-of-thought does not (by itself) reveal a model's sycophancy bias. Models rarely state their answer is being swayed by the user suggestion \u2013 echoing previous results of Turpin et al. (2024) \u2013 and moreover, explanations conditioned on an incorrect user suggestions were not (statistically) less convincing. Yet, as a trend, DNC does seem to be a useful signal for annotators, helping them decipher which model answers should be viewed as less convincing (i.e., due to sycophancy). Overall, this experiment provides two key insights. First, it reiterates that externalizing confidence is a promising route for helping users to identify model sycophancy. Second, it highlights (again) that current methodology is not enough; i.e., since some differences are not statistically significant."}, {"title": "4.3 How Can We Model Sycophancy to Improve Uncertainty Estimation?", "content": "SyRoUP improves uncertainty estimation, given calibrated user suggestions.\nThe result shows how our proposed method can mitigate the biases observed in previous results; e.g., the correlation between UE performance and user confidence in Table 7. For calibrated users, this method capitalizes on information about user suggestions and confidence to improve overall UE accuracy. Our less conclusive observations on non-calibrated users also makes sense, since user confidence becomes less informative about correctness in these cases. All in all, this method contributes to a growing narrative that models (and users) can communicate uncertainty to help mitigate sycophancy bias. While previous results show that humans are not always able to detect sycophancy from the content of answers, our UE methods offers an alternative, improved signal of model correctness. Our method also incorporates information about user confidence, e.g., so users can employ hedging language to lower sycophancy bias, without worrying about how this impacts uncertainty estimation."}, {"title": "5 Conclusions", "content": "This paper studies the relationship between sycophancy bias and uncertainty estimation for the first time.

While these results call for joint externalization of uncertainty (by model and user), we do observe a number of potential caveats, for instance, when users externalize confidence (\u00a7 4.2). Indeed, this user behavior can actually lead to worse uncertainty estimation by the model. Our proposed method (SyRoUP) accounts for these potential biases in UE for collaborative settings, and we demonstrate it's efficacy empirically (\u00a7 4.3)."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "A primary limitation of this study is the lack of large-scale human evaluation. While the automated procedures we use in this work allow us to simulate diverse user strategies and measure the impact of individual features of a suggestion, it would be better to observe collaborative strategies in real user populations. Our tools for measuring impact (accuracy bias and Brier Score bias) would still be useful in these studies. Our method SyRoUP could also be tested on such real world data.\nWe also point out the limited scope of our paper \u2013 conversation forecasting and question-answering. These have many applications, but collaboration is arguably more interesting (and more complex) in many mutli-step, task-oriented dialogue corpora.

These biases can influence decisions even in semi-automated pipelines, where the user collaborates with a model to arrive at a decision. In fact, much of this work highlights this possibility. As such, biases can be propagated by language models unbeknownst to the system user, having unknown and potentially broad ramifications on whomever is impacted by the decisions made. For instance, the implicit biases of a model user may be further exacerbated by the sycophancy bias we have observed in language models. This type of interaction can propagate stereotypes and lead to entrenched views. Thus, we emphasize the methods we study in this paper constitute research prototypes, which are not ready for deployed use among any real-world population of users.

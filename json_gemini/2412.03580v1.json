RSL incorporates logical constraints during symbolic\noptimization, ensuring that the generated formulas are both physically meaningful and interpretable. The\noptimization process is further enhanced using deep reinforcement learning, which efficiently guides the\nsymbolic regression towards more accurate models. The proposed RSL method was evaluated on two turbine\nblade materials, GH4169 and TC4, to identify optimal fatigue life prediction models. When compared with six\nempirical formulas and five machine learning algorithms, RSL not only produces more interpretable formulas\nbut also achieves superior or comparable predictive accuracy.

Aircraft engines typically operate under high temperature, high pressure and high\nspeed, which can lead to various failure modes in turbine blades. Among these, fatigue damage caused by\nalternating loads represents a prevalent failure type observed in blade structures[1]. The inherent complexity of\nfailure mechanisms, coupled with the microscopic scale of crack initiation, renders defect detection challenging.\nConsequently, the accurate and efficient prediction of turbine blade fatigue life has become a focal point of\nresearch within academic and industrial spheres. One of the most widely used approaches is to combine historical\nor real-time critical parameters measured by sensors on the blade, with failure cases to predict potential blade\nfailures through time-series analysis[2]. In the absence of failure cases and data, researchers have initiated an\neffort to accurately delineate the intrinsic correlation between the mechanical properties of a material (e.g.,\ntensile strength, ductility) and its fatigue characteristics, to develop fatigue life prediction models."}, {"title": "2 Technical background", "content": "Accurate fatigue life prediction of turbine blades is essential for aircraft engine reliability.

They\nproposed that the critical plane is determined by a combination of normal and shear strains. Based on this premise,\nthey developed the strain-based KBM fatigue criterion, which was derived from the BM criterion[9, 10].\n\n\\frac{\\Delta \\gamma_{max}}{2} + \\varepsilon_{n} = [1 + \\upsilon e + s_0(1-\\upsilon e)] \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E} (2N_f)^b\n\n\\varsigma_0 =  \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E} (2N_f)^b + \\varepsilon'_{f} (2N_f)^c /{\\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E} (2N_f)^b - (1 + \\upsilon e) \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E} (2N_f)^b}\n\n\n\n\\frac{\\Delta \\gamma_{max}}{2} + \\frac{\\Delta \\varepsilon_{n}}{4} = [1 + \\upsilon e + s_0(1-\\upsilon e)] \\frac{\\sigma'_{f}}{E} (2N_f)^b\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta\\gamma_{max}/2\\) represents the maximum shear strain amplitude, \\(\\Delta\\varepsilon_n\\) is the range of normal strain on the\nmaximum shear plane, and \\(s_0\\) is a material constant obtained by fitting uniaxial and torsional fatigue data.

Our RSL method has accurately identified the explicit physical\nrelationship between the mechanical properties and fatigue life of turbine blade materials. By integrating these\ninsights, once the mechanical performance parameters of the critical areas of the blade under various operating\nconditions have been determined, the fatigue life of the turbine blade can be accurately predicted.\n(1) Finite element simulation\nThe turbine engine features a symmetrical annular structure, with each stage typically containing dozens to\nhundreds of blades, depending on the aspect ratio and other critical factors[33]. Each blade experiences similar\nloading conditions. To save computational time and costs, this project focuses on simulating a single blade using\nCOMSOL, while simplifying certain structural elements that minimally impact the finite element simulation.\nThe model of the single blade is shown in Fig. 8, with an overall radial length of 112.5 mm; the root of the blade\nis 21 mm high and 7.1 mm wide; and the blade crown measures 53.6 mm in length.\n(2) Life prediction\nOne of the primary causes of high-pressure turbine blade failure is low-cycle fatigue. During engine\noperation, under cyclic loading characterized by 'start-up-operation\u2014shutdown', the surface temperature of the\nhigh-pressure turbine blade rapidly increases from room temperature to operational high temperatures,\naccompanied by a significant acceleration in the blade's rotational speed. This results in a rapid increase in\ncentrifugal forces and other loads on the blade. Dynamic operating loads have the greatest impact on the creep\nfatigue life of turbine discs, which can lead to low-cycle fatigue[35], increasing the likelihood of crack initiation\nin stress concentration areas such as the blade root and blade crown. Considering the actual operating conditions\nof turbine engine blades, we conducted COMSOL simulations using the rotational speeds corresponding to four\ndifferent operating conditions (S1, S2, S3, S4) as input variables for the blade model.

In RSL, a binary tree structure and sub-node\ntracking array are used to constrain the expression structure, and logical constraint rules are introduced.\nSpecifically, the overall length of the expression is controlled, the partial dimensionless preprocessing and\nfunction nesting constraints ensure the reasonableness of the physical meaning of the expression, and the\nlimitations on the operation and number of constants are employed to enhance the simplicity of the expression.\nIn addition, the logical constraint rules effectively reduce the search space, enhancing both the computational\nefficiency and accuracy of the algorithm. While RNN is used as a reinforcement learning carrier to generate the\nselection probability of each symbol in the symbol library, which serves as a reinforcement learning selection\nstrategy. Selective reinforcement is applied to elite expressions from the expression batch, guiding subsequent\nbatches to generate superior structures.\nUsing the widely employed turbine blade materials GH4169 and TC4 as evaluations and case studies, we\nidentified structurally consistent and highly predictive formulas for each material. The results show that over 90%\nof the GH4169 predictions fall within a twofold error margin, confirming the high predictive accuracy of the\nRSL method. Compared to traditional empirical formulas, RSL uncovers more precise and explicit expressions\ntailored to the materials. Additionally, RSL matches or exceeds the predictive accuracy of most machine learning\nmodels, while offering greater interpretability and facilitating integration with existing theoretical frameworks.\nBy incorporating finite element simulations to evaluate the mechanical properties under various conditions, we\nwere able to predict the fatigue life cycles of the blades.\nThis paper is an initial effort of RSL for effective prediction of turbine blade life. It holds promise for\napplication to a wide range of life-limited parts beyond turbine blades.

Given the current dataset limitations, the RSL algorithm has primarily explored generalized fatigue\nlife prediction formulas for the same materials under varying conditions.

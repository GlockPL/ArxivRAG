{"title": "Annotating References to Mythological Entities in French Literature", "authors": ["Thierry Poibeau"], "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the relevance of large language models (LLMs) for annotating references to Roman and Greek mythological entities in modern and contemporary French literature. We present an annotation scheme and demonstrate that recent LLMs can be directly applied to follow this scheme effectively, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors. Additionally, we show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) are capable of offering interpretative insights into the use of mythological references by literary authors. However, we also find that LLMs struggle to accurately identify relevant passages in novels (when used as an information retrieval engine), often hallucinating and generating fabricated examples-an issue that raises significant ethical concerns. Nonetheless, when used carefully, LLMs remain valuable tools for performing annotations with high accuracy, especially for tasks that would be difficult to annotate comprehensively on a large scale through manual methods alone.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Mythological allusions often serve as powerful tools for authors, offering symbolic depth and universal themes that resonate across cultures and time. They enrich the storytelling by connecting contemporary works to timeless archetypes and motifs. For example, in the following passage coming from Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, the author reflects on the dissolution of mythological wonder in the modern world:\nLes g\u00e9ographes, les arch\u00e9ologues nous conduisent bien dans l'\u00eele de Calypso, exhument bien le palais de Minos. Seulement Calypso n'est plus qu'une femme, Minos, qu'un roi sans rien de divin. Ainsi s'\u00e9tait dissip\u00e9e toute la gracieuse mythologie oc\u00e9anique que J'avais compos\u00e9e les premiers jours.\nIn the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower (\u00c0 l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs, also translated as Within a Budding Grove), 1919.\nHere, Proust uses mythological references to highlight the loss of enchantment and the reduction of myths to mundane realities.\nToday, we have access to vast collections of digitized corpora. For French literature, Gallica provides more than 15,000 novels, most with high-quality OCR [1], making these corpora suitable for computational exploration, commonly referred to as cultural analytics. Furthermore, specialized annotation frameworks like BookNLP [2] have been developed, enabling the analysis of entities (such as characters and locations [3]) and coreference resolution (linking all mentions of the same real-world entity [4, 5]).\nHowever, there are known challenges with such annotation frameworks [6]. For instance, BookNLP uses the tag \u201cPER\u201d for persons/characters, but how should we categorize speaking animals or Gods that influence the narrative? While frameworks like BookNLP offer a basic, generic annotation layer useful for many studies, researchers often require additional, more specialized layers with finer-grained categories. These custom annotation schemes may also need to reference external ontologies, introducing the need for entity linking [7] (a feature not provided by the original BookNLP) or even necessitating the creation of custom tools.\nConsider, for example, the case of Greek mythology. Our goal is to identify references to Greek mythology in 19th-century French literature, with the hypothesis that many of these references are metaphorical or used to highlight a specific trait of a novel's protagonist. In this context, the focus is not only (and perhaps not primarily) on identifying the Gods and other mythological figures themselves, but rather on understanding how these references relate to the qualities, mindset, or symbolic traits of another character in the narrative.\nThis raises several important research questions: How can mythological references be effec- tively recognized in contemporary novels? How can different annotation levels and schemes be combined within the same text? How can we annotate the symbolic meaning or power of mythological references? And finally, what resources and tools would be best suited for these tasks?\nThis paper is structured as follows. We first show that LLMs (and, more specifically, ChatGPT) can be used effectively to annotate and interpret relevant mentions to mythological entities in texts, although not without occasionally making significant analytical errors. We then observe that the same models, somewhat unexpectedly, struggle when used as retrieval engines in the same context. The paper finishes on a discussion and some perspectives based on our observations."}, {"title": "2. Previous Work", "content": "The study of mythological entity annotation in recent literature has garnered increasing in- terest within the digital humanities, particularly as natural language processing (NLP) tools"}, {"title": "3. An Annotation Scheme for Mythological Entities", "content": "Our annotation scheme for annotating mythological entities in contemporary novels was created to address the complexity and variety of mythological references in modern literature. Existing tagsets for entity recognition, such as those used for general Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, do not capture the specific nuances of mythological references, which can include not only figures like Gods and creatures but also abstract concepts, locations, and significant objects from myths. By defining tags like \u201cdeity,\u201d \u201chero,\u201d \u201cevent,\u201d and \u201cconcept,\u201d this schema allows for a richer and more precise annotation process.\nThe tagset builds on previous work in computational mythology, such as the use of ontologies like the Ontology of Greek Mythology (OGM), but extends it to fit the context of contemlporary novels where mythological references often serve metaphorical or symbolic purposes. Here is an overview of the categories considered.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"deity\">: For gods or goddesses, like Zeus or Athena.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"hero\">: For mythological heroes like Heracles or Achilles.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"creature\">: For mythological creatures like the Minotaur.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"half_creature\">: For beings like centaurs or satyrs.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"creature_group\">: For groups of mythological entities like the Gor- gons or collective references to \u201cmonsters.\u201d\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"monsters\">: For general references to mythological beings or mon- sters.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"location\">: For places or geographic references like \u00c9rymanthos.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"event\">: For mythological events, like the Trojan War or the Labors of Heracles.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"object\">: For mythological objects, like the Golden Fleece or Pandora's Box.\n\u2022 <mythEntity type=\"concept\">: For abstract mythological concepts, like Fate or Nemesis.\nThis tagset can help structure and clarify mythological references, distinguishing between individual creatures, groups, and locations. It can easily be expanded, for instance, to spec- ify which mythology the entity belongs to (Greek, Roman, or other), or to include a more refined categorization of events (to include classes such as community-centric, character-centric, environmental, etc.)."}, {"title": "4. Entity Annotation with LLMs", "content": "As discussed, some resources exist for annotating mythological references in novels, but it appears that they are not as effective as large language models (LLMs). These resources are often limited by language-specific variations (such as names of Gods differing across languages), are not always comprehensive, and may provide irrelevant or excessive information that complicates the annotation process.\nIn contrast, LLMs, which are trained on extensive datasets including mythological information from sources like Wikipedia, offer a more powerful and adaptable solution for mythological entity annotation. In our tests with Mistral, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT (version 3 and 40), more than 95% of mythological entities were recognized. These models demonstrate impressive performance by drawing from their broad training data and applying it effectively across different contexts.\nBelow is the example from Marcel Proust, already cited above, annotated by ChatGPT (version 40) using the annotation scheme presented in the previous section (see Annex 1 for details on the prompt we used for annotation). This demonstrates how LLMs can identify mythological references in a literary context, although with numerous errors in the type and span of entities to annotate.\nLes g\u00e9ographes, les arch\u00e9ologues nous conduisent bien dans l'\u00eele de <mythEn- tity type=\"location\">Calypso</mythEntity>, exhument bien le palais de <mythEntity type= \"deity\">Minos</mythEntity>.Seulement <mythEntity type=\"location\">Calypso</mythEntity>n'est plus qu'une femme, <mythEn- tity type= \"deity\">Minos</mythEntity>, qu'un roi sans rien de divin. Ainsi s'\u00e9tait dissip\u00e9e toute la gracieuse <mythEntity_type=\"concept\">mythologie oc\u00e9anique</mythEntity>que J'avais compos\u00e9e les premiers jours.\nThe first occurrence is correctly recognized as a location name, but it is \u201c\u00eele de Calypso\" that should be annotated, not just \u201cCalypso.\u201d Then \"Minos\" is identified as a deity, whereas it is \u201cle Palais de Minos\u201d that should be recognized and analyzed as a location name. Then, Calypso is again identified as a location name, even though the text at this point clearly refers to the deity. This illustrates a \u201ccontagion\u201d phenomenon, where different occurrences tend to be assigned the same type, despite distinct and context-specific indications. In subsequent interactions, we also observed that ChatGPT can sometimes alter the original text (e.g., replacing the second occurrence of \u201cCalypso\u201d with \"\u00eele de Calypso\" to align it with the first occurrence). This highlights the importance of using ChatGPT with caution and carefully verifying that the original text remains unaltered.\nBelow is another example (all the examples are from Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time). Annotation proves more reliable with isolated examples, suggesting that the previous issue was primarily caused by the varying contexts in which the same entity appeared, as said above.\nSi alors passait la princesse de Guermantes, belle et l\u00e9g\u00e8re comme <mythEntity type=\"deity\">Diane</mythEntity>, laissant tra\u00eener derri\u00e8re elle un manteau incom- parable, faisant se d\u00e9tourner toutes les t\u00eates et suivie par tous les yeux (par ceux de Mme de Cambremer plus que par tous les autres), M. de Beausergent s'absorbait dans une conversation avec sa voisine\nAnd finally, another example related to Roman mythology (Minerve).\nJe ne pensais pas qu'aucune femme p\u00fbt usurper le corsage paillet\u00e9 de l'autre plus que <mythEntity type=\"object\">l'\u00e9gide \u00e9tincelante et frang\u00e9e</mythEntity>de <mythEntity type=\"deity\">Minerve</mythEntity>.\nThese are just examples. Our study is not comprehensive here, but this shows that it pos- sible for a system to annotate pretty accurately French novels including sporadic, albeit real, references to Roman or Greek mythology.\nMore precisely, our experiments on 200 examples from 19th-century French novels (chosen randomly from the Gallica collection) using ChatGPT-40 demonstrate that 98% of the entities were recognized, with more than 95% being accurately annotated. The majority of issues encountered were consistent with the challenges previously described, such as incorrect spans or misclassification of entity types. These errors were often attributable to ambiguous or conflicting local contexts, which posed difficulties for the model in accurately interpreting and annotating specific occurrences. Note that these errors remain, however, marginal, and our observations indicate that ChatGPT can be effectively used to annotate texts, particularly when the process includes a phase of manual review and correction."}, {"title": "5. Interpreting References to Mythological Entities in French Novels", "content": "However, our primary goal is not just to recognize reference to mythological entities, but to analyze their contribution to the text [13]. Mythological references can offer cultural or historical commentary. By invoking ancient myths, authors connect the present with the past, highlighting continuities or contrasts in human behavior and societal values. In contemporary French novels, for instance, references to Greek Gods or mythological events might serve to critique contemporary issues or explore human psychology in ways that transcend time and place [14]. This intertextuality (or transtextuality, as Genette calls it [15]) enriches the narrative and invites readers to engage with multiple layers of interpretation. Through myth, authors can address complex emotions, ideals, and conflicts with a shorthand that draws on collective cultural knowledge [16].\nTo what extent can this kind of interpretation be deduced by LLMs from the original text? ChatGPT (40) can produce the following comment from the first passage given as an example above:\n\"In this passage, Proust reflects on the disenchantment of the modern world, where the mythological and divine have been reduced to mundane historical facts. By stating that geographers and archaeologists have found the island of Calypso and the palace of Minos, he suggests that these once-magical places are now simply physical locations devoid of their former mythic grandeur. Calypso is no longer a goddess, and Minos is just a king, stripped of their divine and symbolic power. Proust is mourning the loss of the imaginative, poetic dimension that mythologies once offered.\u201d\nThis interpretation is correct, but probably reflect sources directly available on the Web. Care must be taken to ensure that the language model is not hallucinating or creating spurious interpretations. This is especially important for books whose content may not be part of the model's training data (such as most of those from Gallica, which should not be used without prior agreement for training commercial models) [17]. Although, in our case, interpretations rely on widely known information available in reference databases, particularly Wikipedia, as previously mentioned, this does not completely eliminate the risk of hallucination. LLMs can be considered as valuable tools for providing immediate interpretations of local contexts, such as when a character is directly compared to a mythological figure or when a mythological entity is invoked in relation to a specific character."}, {"title": "6. The Inability of LLMs to Retrieve Relevant Passages and the Risk of Hallucination", "content": "In the previous sections, we showed that large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, LLAMA, and Mistral, can accurately annotate references to mythology. Their analysis tends to be correct, often more thorough than manual annotations, as they can easily detect rare references that may otherwise be missed across lengthy texts. But are LLMs equally good at retrieving passages containing references to mythological entities or events?"}, {"title": "7. Conclusion and Perspectives", "content": "Expanding the annotation and analysis of mythological references to a large corpus of 15,000 French novels will open new opportunities for both quantitative and qualitative research. We can expect to uncover patterns in how mythological entities are invoked across different time periods, genres, and authors, revealing how modern French literature repurposes ancient myths. This broader dataset will allow for the identification of recurrent themes, metaphors, and cultural shifts in the treatment of mythology, offering insight into how these references shape characters and narratives over time.\nThis expanded analysis will also make it possible to trace the evolution of mythological archetypes and their transformation in different literary contexts. We can expect to conduct comparative studies between individual authors and movements, evaluating whether partic- ular myths are associated with specific literary genres or thematic concerns (e.g., existential- ism, romanticism, realism). Additionally, this large-scale study will enable the exploration of metaphorical uses of mythology, helping to determine how certain deities or myths become allegorical references for contemporary issues, such as power, identity, or morality."}, {"title": "8.

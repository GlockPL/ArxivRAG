However, this extensive integration of IoT devices has also introduced significant cybersecurity risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted the attention of cybersecurity professionals after cyber-attackers started using IoT devices as botnets (Palekar and Radhika 2022). IoT devices are often vulnerable to various cyber threats, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, botnet exploitation, and data breaches, all of which can compromise critical systems' integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Understanding and mitigating the risks associated with IoT deployments is crucial in this evolving landscape, especially given the interdependencies between IoT components and systems."}, {"title": "1.1 Motivation", "content": "The primary motivation for this research arises from the pressing need to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing cyber risks in IoT environments. While several risk assessment models have been developed, only some fully capture the unique dependencies and interactions between IoT devices, networks, and services. These dependencies introduce cascading risks, where vulnerabilities in one component can propagate through the entire system, amplifying the impact of an attack. Additionally, existing risk models often need more real-time adaptability and need to consider the heterogeneity of IoT systems, where devices from different manufacturers and platforms interact in dynamic and unpredictable ways. Given the increasing reliance on IoT in critical sectors such as healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities, a more robust, adaptable, and scalable risk assessment model is urgently needed.\nThe research also addresses the gap in effectively utilising AI/ML techniques for real-time risk assessment in IoT environments while ensuring these models are explainable and transparent to decision-makers.

A Dependency-Based Cyber Risk Model for IoT Systems: We propose a novel dependency-based risk assessment framework that captures the interdependencies between IoT components and their cascading effects on overall system security. The model systematically quantifies and mitigates risks based on the interaction between devices, networks, and services.\n2. Incorporation of AI/ML for Dynamic Risk Estimation: The proposed model integrates AI/ML techniques to enable real-time risk assessment. The machine learning models are trained on diverse data sources, including network traffic, vulnerability databases, and incident logs, to predict and prioritise risks in dynamic IoT environments. Explainable AI (XAI) ensures that these predictions are transparent and interpretable to cybersecurity professionals.\n3.

Although there are many different cybersecurity approaches, they seem insufficient or not targeted at the right areas. This leads to a lack of security that creates unnecessary difficulty for IoT-connected producers and customers. The growth of the IoT market could increase significantly if policymakers have the methodology to assess, predict, analyse, and address the risks of IoT-related cyber-attacks in the communications network. Without the appropriate risk assessment methodology, cyber risk could have costly consequences. Connecting cyber risk with IoT through impact models can provide feedback sensors and real-time data mechanisms to assist and enable industries and policymakers to understand and visualise the problem and address the risk created by IoT-related cyber-attacks."}, {"title": "4.1 Defining Cyber Risk", "content": "IoT risk and the risk of cyber-attacks can be explained by established methods for calculating risk. Risk = Likelihood \u00d7 Consequences, and cyber-risk can be defined as a function of:\nR = { si, pi, xi }, i = 1, 2, ..., N,\nWhere R \u2013 risk; s \u2013 the description of a scenario (undesirable event); p \u2013 the probability of a scenario;\nX\nthe measure of consequences or damage caused by a scenario; N \u2013 the number of possible\nscenarios that may cause damage to a system.\nThe model above for calculating risk is classical (USA 2017), but the question remains how IoT risk and cyber-attack risk can be estimated. Since we do not have the precise measurements and concrete number of IoT cyber risks, an answer is difficult to present and justify with a desirable degree of certainty that the estimation is correct. Therefore, we discuss how IoT risk and the risk of cyber-attacks can be estimated assuming possession of the required data.\nBusinesses face strategic, compliance, operational, financial, and reputational risks regularly, all of which could affect their profitability or ability to function. Many businesses are looking to adopt new forms of technology (such as IoT, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence) to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their services. This exposes them to the risks that accompany these technologies."}, {"title": "4.2 IoT risk assessment", "content": "Understanding what is meant by risk is only the first step when we are considering the potential risks in IoT. The next step is to be able to assess the risk, which involves the tasks of: (1) identifying (or defining) the risk - the action of developing a clear understanding of what organisational IoT assets are targeted by which threats and what harm could happen if those attacks are successful (Tanczer et al. 2018).\n(2) Estimating the risk - this task aims to measure IoT risk based on the likelihood of the threat occurring and the impact on the organisation's infrastructure if it does occur. These measures can be qualitative (e.g., ratings using the levels, high, medium, and low) or quantitative (e.g., based on mathematical estimations and calculations).\n(3) Prioritising the risk; once we have a list of the risks and each one has been estimated, the next task is for a company to prioritise the risks. This essentially provides a ranking of the risks based on their estimated levels. We interpreted that identifying the risk, estimating the risk, and prioritising the risk are three tasks of IoT risk assessment.

While risk management techniques are well developed and used in various IT areas, there remains a significant challenge in managing IoT risk. Here, we include our findings in the form of four basic ways to resolve IoT risk:\nIoT risk mitigation involves either reducing the likelihood of the risk happening or reducing the impact of the risk. In IoT risk management, this might include implementing IoT risk controls.\nIoT risk transfer \u2013 this involves outsourcing the risk to a third party. In this instance, via cyber insurance for example;\nIoT risk avoidance \u2013 this involves removing the risk. An example would be to remove IoT asset where the risk has originated; and\nIoT risk acceptance \u2013 this involves accepting the risk as it stands, due to either the risk falling within the organisational risk appetite or the aggregated risk being sufficiently within the accepted risk levels.\nThe type of treatment selected for each risk is based on its estimated level, the costs associated with the treatment, and the organisation's overall tolerance for risk.

These criteria were established following a comprehensive literature review and consultation with experts in cybersecurity, including those from Cisco Systems. The following criteria guided our framework selection:\n1. Industry Adoption and Standardisation: One of the primary indicators of prominence was the degree of adoption within industry sectors and standardisation by international bodies. Frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO/IEC 27001 were included because they are widely recognised and applied across various industries and sectors as global standards for cybersecurity risk management. Their extensive use across governmental, industrial, and private sectors made them foundational to this study.\n2.

Dependency modelling (DM) is a goal-oriented method of representing the interactions and inter-reliance amongst system components or elements using same to reason about the scope of risk feasible (Cherdantseva et al. 2022). DM works on the assumption that risks emerge from interactions and interdependencies which need to be recognised in order to effectively manage and guard against the impacts of the risks (Alpcan and Bambos 2009).\nDM for security risk assessment can work through analysing the vulnerabilities that can be found in IoT network/system components \u2013 evaluating the interactions and service flow amongst connected components including hardware infrastructure, software platforms (applications), processes, services, users, etc., and how these threats and and vulnerabilities affect both the target components and others connected. Generally, these are explored considering how the entire system functions and objectives are impacted. Security threats and vulnerabilities can emerge or exist in diverse forms, ranging from design flaws in hardware, software, and processes, as well as competency limitation in users, which can easily be exploited by malware, social engineering, etc. Thus, the service or functional dependencies amongst IoT system components can be used to design a unified approach for IoT risk assessment. In doing this, we consider contexts from IoT literature and use cases in the model definition and verification.\nInteractions within IoT can be seen as complex, tightly coupled relationship structures amongst the systems, sub-systems, and components. This means that IoT subsystems and components inter-cooperate to fulfil desired service objectives, which each sub-system or components is unable to achieve in isolation. To function appropriately, one or more sub-systems rely considerably on the appropriate functions of another system or sub-system they connect to and receive command or instruction input.

Then, an initial zero defence configuration is supported with a reactive defence that is activated when a vulnerability is exploited (Woods and Simpson, n.d.).

The following points elaborate on the significance and interpretation of Table 3:\n1. Categorisation of Risk Principles\nTable 3 is structured to categorise risks based on specific principles that reflect different dimensions of IoT security. Each risk category is allocated a unique code, which corresponds to a specific vulnerability or risk scenario identified in IoT systems. These principles encompass a wide range of security concerns, from technical vulnerabilities (e.g., device compromise) to broader strategic risks (e.g., reputational damage from data breaches).\nThe inclusion of these principles allows for a comprehensive assessment that goes beyond individual technical vulnerabilities, offering a more holistic view of the organisation's overall risk posture. This categorisation enables organisations to prioritise risks based on their relevance and severity in different IoT environments, such as smart cities, industrial IoT, or healthcare.\n2. Weighting System\nEach risk category is assigned a weight ranging from 0 to 3, depending on the likelihood and impact of the associated vulnerability or threat.

However, one of the key challenges associated with AI/ML in cybersecurity, and specifically in IoT dependency risk analysis, is ensuring that the decision-making process remains explainable and transparent. Stakeholders, including cybersecurity professionals and decision-makers, must be able to understand how AI/ML systems arrive at their conclusions, especially in high-stakes environments like IoT, where decisions may affect safety and critical operations.\nTo address these challenges, several strategies and best practices can be implemented to improve explainability and transparency:\n1. Use of Explainable AI (XAI) Techniques\nExplainable AI (XAI) is an emerging field that focuses on making AI and ML models more interpretable without sacrificing performance. XAI techniques ensure that decisions made by AI models can be traced back to understandable factors. When applying XAI to dependency risk analysis in IoT systems, the following methods can be utilised:\n\u2022 Feature Importance: In dependency risk analysis, ML models typically analyse multiple features (e.g., network traffic, device telemetry, historical attack data). Feature importance techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), can help explain which features had the most significant impact on the model's decision.

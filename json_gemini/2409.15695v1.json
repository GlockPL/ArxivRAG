INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the era of 6G, the integration of networks spanning space, air, ground, and sea is anticipated to facilitate instant, efficient, and intelligent hyper-connectivity communications. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a crucial component in this context, serving as an efficient and intelligent paradigm for future communication [1]. The adoption of an encoder- decoder structure within the SemCom system allows for the transmission of only essential information in source messages, enabling the receiver to accurately reconstruct the original message. This capability allows SemCom to surpass the limita- tions set by Shannon's theorem, accomplishing communication tasks with minimal bit transmission. Consequently, SemCom is poised to bolster wireless communications in scenarios involving a high volume of immersive communication tasks, such as metaverses, in environments with stringent delay requirements like autonomous driving, and in situations where bandwidth resources are limited, such as maritime communi- cation and remote area communication, especially in the 6G landscape [2], [3].\nThe evolution of Neural Network (NN) models has sig- nificantly improved the performance of SemCom systems, enabling them to handle a variety of complex tasks, such as multimodal [4] and task-oriented communications [5]. However, this progress also highlights inherent vulnerabilities in SemCom systems, primarily linked to the weaknesses of NN models. One critical vulnerability is their suscepti- bility to semantic noise attacks, where an attacker injects semantic noise into the communication source, leading to decoded message distortion or degraded accuracy [6]. The open nature of wireless channels exacerbates this fragility, as it permits the injection of semantic noise into the physical channel [7], [8]. Moreover, the presence of a warden in the communication environment poses additional privacy risks. A warden can monitor active communications between devices and exploit exposed model parameters of the semantic de- coder to extract sensitive user information [9], [10]. These weaknesses can easily be exploited to tamper with critical information or eavesdrop on private information. For instance, in a SemCom-based vehicular network, a well-behaved vehicle broadcasts safety messages to nearby vehicles to enhance driving safety [11]. However, if an attacker tampers with the message by adding semantic noise, surrounding vehicles will receive falsified information. This may cause unnecessary emergency braking, leading vehicles into dangerous situations. Therefore, investigating trustworthy semantic communication in 6G networks is urgently needed.\nThere are several approaches to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities. To tackle semantic noise attacks, Kang et al. [6] and Nan et al. [7] suggest enhancing the robustness of semantic codecs by using adversarial training technology. They incorporate adversarial semantics noise into the source or channel during the training of the semantic codec, which can bolster the system's resistance against semantic noise attacks originating from both the source and the physical channel. To shield communication status from detection by a purposeful warden, Du et al. [9] propose that the semantic compression rate can be adjusted to reduce the probability of communica- tion behavior being detected. Furthermore, to safeguard against illegal decoding of the semantic information, Luo et al. [10] advocate deploying a semantic encryption mechanism. Despite these advancements, the challenge of developing a SemCom system that can effectively counteract multiple security threats"}, {"title": "II. SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION IN 6G NETWORK", "content": "SemCom has emerged as a key enabling technology to meet the high-speed and large-scale information transmission requirements in 6G networks [1]. It concentrates on extracting the semantic contents of the source message at the transmitter and interpreting their meanings at the receiver. By exchang- ing semantic information at both ends, SemCom enables the reconstruction of source messages or direct execution of downstream tasks with tolerance for transmission errors [2].\nThe Deep Learning (DL)-based encoder-decoder architec- ture plays a primary role in the SemCom system. In this system, a DL-based semantic encoder at the transmitter ef- fectively encapsulates the essential meaning behind messages while a DL-based semantic decoder at the receiver reconstructs the transmitted semantic information into an understandable form. Various neural networks can be employed by these DL-based semantic codecs to process different types of se- mantic information. For example, the Transformer exhibits high proficiency in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and is innovatively used in textual SemCom systems [14]. Besides, SemCom building upon other DL models such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models can extract features from different data modalities like images and audio, thereby enhancing the efficiency of message transmission over wireless channels [15]."}, {"title": "B. Semantic Communication Applications in 6G Networks", "content": "Considering the high efficiency of SemCom, we present four potential application scenarios of SemCom in space-air- ground-sea integrated 6G networks, as depicted in Fig. 1.\n\u2022 Remote area communication: SemCom can enhance disaster monitoring in remote areas to facilitate emer- gency response by relevant institutions. For example, if a forest fire occurs deep in the mountain with poor communication conditions, edge servers can extract the essential fire information (e.g., location) detected by the adjacently installed sensor, and then forward it to the neighboring data center after the relay of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite through Terahertz (THz) communication [2]. The cloud data center can promptly decode the semantic representation to acquire the original complete information and then notify the nearest fire brigade to the scene of the fire.\n\u2022 Autonomous driving: In an intelligent transportation system, autonomous vehicles need to keep connected with other vehicles and roadside infrastructures, e.g., RoadSide Units (RSUs), to enhance contextual awareness of road conditions for safe driving [11]. SemCom fosters connected vehicles to share road information with lower latency and higher efficiency. For instance, when low- attitude vehicles, e.g. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), find a traffic accident such as a terrestrial collision during the flight, they can efficiently convey the coded semantic information of the accident, even in urban areas with abundant tall buildings.\n\u2022 Maritime communication: The harsh oceanic wireless environment challenges maritime communications due to poor channel conditions causing bit distortion [2]. SemCom mitigates this by conveying the meaning of messages rather than bit streams. For example, a sub- marine detecting an unknown marine creature with sonar can semantically encode and transmit the information to a targeted vessel (e.g., a steamship) via an acoustic se- mantic communication system. Meanwhile, a Geostation- ary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite can use remote sensing technology to monitor the state of the corresponding sea area and transmit it to the steamship. By decoding both semantic sources, the steamship can comprehensively un- derstand the maritime situation, thereby making informed navigation decisions.\n\u2022 Metaverse: SemCom is expected to play a transforma- tive role in the operation of metaverses [3], [6]. By capturing vital semantic information for transmission, SemCom dramatically reduces communication latency, thereby guaranteeing users' immersive experiences in metaverses. For instance, wearable devices, e.g., VR glasses, can collect multimodal sensory inputs, such as text, image, speech, and video from metaverse users. Due to the limited computing resources of wearable devices, computation-intensive tasks like rendering avatars and virtual spaces should be offloaded to edge servers for further processing [11]. To this end, the raw data are transmitted to the base station via a SemCom system [6]. With the recovered user data, the base station can ren- der a hyper-realistic metaverse and provide remarkable metaverse services back to users."}, {"title": "C. Security Issues and Defense Schemes of SemCom", "content": "As discussed above, SemCom has numerous potential ap- plications that can shape our future lifestyle. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the security issues and defenses associated with SemCom. As shown in Table I, attacks against SemCom can be divided into two categories based on the ultimate goal of attackers, namely, tampering information and eavesdropping information. Tampering can occur at the source end and the channel end, while eavesdropping is divided into two steps: detection of communication status and acquisition of source information. This section introduces these threat models along with existing defense schemes.\nTampering Attack from Source End: By injecting adver- sarial semantic noise into the source, an attacker can make the semantic decoder fail to restore the source information accurately, leading to incorrect information acquisition at the receiver and erroneous outcomes for downstream tasks. In the white-box mode, the attacker fully grasps the model parame- ters and weights of the semantic codec, thereby accurately ad- justing the gradient information to obtain a minimum semantic noise that causes the semantic codec to produce wrong results. In the black-box mode, the attacker can only query the input and output of the codec a finite number of times to achieve the same goal without gradient information [6]. Note that a source-end attack does not imply that the sender is the attacker, as an attacker could post noisy images in the real world (e.g., post-it notes on a traffic sign) that the sender unknowingly captures and transmits, thus unexpectedly triggering the attack.\nTampering Attack from Channel End: An attacker can introduce semantic noise into the channel to achieve the same effect as tampering at the source end. However, generating the semantic noise against the channel side requires the attacker to possess more supplementary knowledge. In the white-box mode, the attacker needs to know the model parameters of both the semantic encoder and the semantic decoder, while even in the black-box mode, the attacker is required to be able to query the complete communication input and output. Since tampering attacks add adversarial semantic noise at the source or channel output to achieve their goal, defenders typically assume the presence of a noise generator when"}, {"title": "III. MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS (MOE)-BASED SEMANTIC COMMUNICATION FOR TRUSTWORTHY 6G NETWORKS", "content": "Although existing research works have each proposed a defense scheme to prevent a certain attack in SemCom sys- tems, these approaches cannot simultaneously defend against multiple types of malicious attacks according to users' specific security requirements during communications, e.g., covertness and robustness. This limitation is particularly problematic in real-world scenarios. Therefore, to enable the practical application of SemCom, it is imperative to design an effective SemCom system to preserve telecommunication security under multiple heterogeneous threats for trustworthy 6G networks."}, {"title": "A. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Network Model", "content": "The MoE network typically involves a gating network and several specialized trained models (i.e., experts), which can perform diverse machine learning tasks by selectively activating a subset of experts according to model inputs [12]. This simple network architecture caters to the demands for enhancing the trustworthiness of SemCom with a reasonable computational cost. In addition, the MoE can easily adapt to new datasets and AI tasks by adding or re-training experts without overhauling the entire network. With this scalable feature, an MoE-based SemCom system can retain normal operation by incorporating a newly trained expert whenever a novel security issue arises."}, {"title": "B. An MoE-based Semantic Communication System for Trustworthy 6G Networks", "content": "As shown in Fig. 2, we propose an MoE-based SemCom system to handle users' diverse security requirements in 6G networks. The proposed SemCom system consists of a gating network, multiple semantic encoder experts for each modality at the transmitter end, and corresponding semantic decoder experts at the receiver end. The process of handling the source message and requirements in the MoE-based SemCom system is described below.\n\u2022 Step1: The transmitter takes the source message $S$ and the user's personal security requirements $PSR$ as inputs to the gating network.\n\u2022 Step2: The gating network outputs the decision $D$ about the selection and execution order of the experts based on source information and requirements.\n\u2022 Step3: According to decision $D$, the transmitter calls the corresponding experts (semantic encoders and defense methods) to encode the source message $S$ to obtain semantic information $Y$.\n\u2022 Step4: After channel encoding, wireless channel, and channel decoding, the receiver obtains semantic informa- tion $\\hat{Y}$.\n\u2022 Step5: By calling the corresponding decoder experts, the receiver recovers the source message $\\hat{S}$.\nTo satisfy various user-defined security requirements, the data inputs from users of the proposed MoE-based SemCom system involve source messages and users' personal security requirements. By analyzing user objectives from the personal security requirement, the gating network can orchestrate the selection of experts to conduct security-oriented or privacy- preserving semantic encoding and decoding during SemCom. For example, users seek to immersively experience metaverse applications without privacy leakage [11]. This demands that during message transmission, the sensitive sensory data in- puts (i.e., the source message $S$) should be anti-tampering and encrypted (i.e., the personal security requirement $PSR$). Based on $PSR$ and $S$, the gating network makes decisions $D$ to sequentially call the trained robust encoder and privacy encoder to extract the semantic information $Y$ credibly [13]. The extracted semantic information is then processed as $Y$ by the channel encoder, wireless channel, and channel decoder. Then the privacy decoder and robust encoder at the receiver process the $\\hat{Y}$ to recover $\\hat{S}$ for the output. Since both robust codecs and privacy codecs are invoked, the communication process avoids message tampering and eavesdropping. The output $\\hat{S}$ can be applied in various tasks, such as source message reconstruction and downstream task execution [4]."}, {"title": "C. Gating Network and Experts Architectures and Training Method", "content": "1) Gating network: The key component of the MoE network is the gating network, which routes the source message to the proper experts. Here, we deploy a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) at the transmitter as the gating network to select one or more semantic codec experts based on users' security re- quirements [12]. The user's security and privacy requirements are embedded as a vector $PSR$ as part of the input to the gating network, with the source message $S$ to be transferred constituting the other part. The output of the gating network is a vector representing the decision $D$. During training, we randomly generate a dataset of uniformly distributed user requirements, and each requirement corresponds to a correct expert selection as the label. A user may have multiple requirements at the same time, corresponding to multiple labels. The loss function of the gating network comprises the selection loss and selection penalty of semantic codec experts, guiding the parameter updates of the MLP. The selection loss ensures that the gating network correctly routes the input to specialized experts to enhance task accuracy and meet user-defined security requirements. The selection penalty ensures that the gating network does not select unnecessary experts, re- ducing computing costs. Note that the gating network is trained after the expert's training, and the experts' model parameters are frozen during the gating network training. Therefore, when new experts are added, only the gating network needs to be fine-tuned, eliminating the need to retrain the entire system [12]. This architecture provides greater scalability for the SemCom system.\n2) Normal codecs: The architecture of a normal codec consists of a semantic encoder, a semantic decoder, a chan- nel encoder, and a channel decoder [14]. The semantic and channel encoder is deployed at the transmitter end, while the semantic and channel decoder is deployed at the receiver"}, {"title": "IV. CASE STUDY", "content": "As a case study, a simulation is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed MoE-based SemCom system. In this scenario, moving vehicles utilize semantic communication to exchange images captured by vehicular sensors, support- ing applications such as autonomous driving and vehicular metaverses [6]. The environment includes different types of attackers attempting to tamper with information or eavesdrop on user privacy. The proposed MoE-based SemCom system, comprising a gating network, semantic codecs, and defense mechanisms, is deployed in the vehicles to counter these heterogeneous attacks. Based on this, vehicular users can customize their own security and privacy requirements based on the contents being transmitted.\nWe consider a scenario in which vehicles perform image task-oriented semantic communications with each other. The sender uses the MoE-based SemCom system to encode and send the acquired image, while the receiver decodes it and completes classification tasks [6]. During the communication process, we implement the four attacks mentioned above. The proposed SemCom system includes corresponding experts to resist the attacks and a gating network to precisely call these experts. Since the communication task is classification, a Resnet20 network is used as the normal codec [6]. The loss function for training normal codecs uses cross entropy as a classification loss."}, {"title": "B. Simulation Settings", "content": "We consider a traffic sign recognition task to evaluate the performance of the proposed MoE-based SemCom system. The dataset used in the simulation experiments is the GTSRB 1, which consists of over 50,000 images with resolutions ranging from 15 \u00d7 15 to 250 \u00d7 250 pixels, divided into 43 classes. During the performance evaluation of the MoE-based SemCom system, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is added to the channel with a Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) between 0 and 12 [14]. For the covert codec, the detection error probability, covert rate, and bandwidth are set to 95%,"}, {"title": "C. Simulation Results", "content": "Figure 3 shows the performance of the proposed MoE- based SemCom system when the system suffers attacks. The subfigures 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d) show the situation when it suffers a single attack, while the subfigures 3(e), 3(f), 3(g), and 3(h) are the case of multiple heterogeneous attacks. Various performance indicators prove that the proposed MoE- based SemCom system can adaptively select appropriate ex- perts to complete communication tasks based on the user's security and privacy requirements. Numerical results show that the MoE-based SemCom system can effectively resist single attacks with minimal accuracy loss.\nFigure 3(a) shows the situation where SemCom is subject to tampering attacks from the source end. The MoE-based SemCom maintains a communication accuracy of about 80% under various SNR ratio conditions, while the accuracy of the normal method drops to about 40%. In addition, even in the absence of attack interference, the MOE-based approach still has higher accuracy compared to the normal method. Similarly, as shown in Figure 3(b), in the face of tampering attacks from the channel end, the MoE-based method can maintain an accuracy of more than 80% and increase to 90% with the improvement of channel quality. The accuracy of the general method falls below 60% in the face of the attack from the channel end. It is worth noting that the accuracy of the proposed method in Figure 3(a) is not the same as that in Figure 3(b) without attacks. This is because the different requirements of the user cause the gating network to select different experts to handle the content to be transmitted. Since no previous paper has proposed a specific scheme to increase the DFP of an attacker by increasing the semantic compres- sion rate in semantic communication, Figure 3(c) explores the accuracy performance and the DFP when adding covert codec experts with different compression rates to the MoE- based system. The numerical results show that the increase of compression ratio can significantly increase DFP, but the cost is that the communication accuracy will be weakened. Figure 3(d) shows the performance of the proposed method in the face of an eavesdropper, where the legal receiver can obtain high communication accuracy, especially at a high SNR, while the eavesdropper can hardly decode the message content.\nFigure 3(e) illustrates the performance of the proposed approach against both source-end attackers and a warden, showing that the MoE-based method achieves both high com- munication accuracy and DFP. As shown in Figure 3(f), the proposed approach is equally advantageous in the face of channel-end attackers and wardens. Moreover, the MOE-based method can achieve similar results when facing a single type of attack with a high SNR. Figure 3(g) shows the simultaneous attack of the warden and the eavesdropper, where the MoE- based approach makes the eavesdropper achieve a very low precision parallel while maintaining the accuracy of the legal receiver and the DFP compared to the normal approach. As shown in Figure 3(h), the proposed method can maintain stable communication accuracy and confidentiality in the face of channel-end attackers and eavesdroppers. In general, because"}, {"title": "V. FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "The proposed MoE-based SemCom requires users to input their security and privacy requirements to tailor decision-making processes accordingly. Some users anticipate that these requirements will be addressed unconsciously, requiring minimal explicit guidance. For instance, if source messages include location details, the gating network autonomously selects the privacy codec without explicit user directives. By enabling automated decision-making based on user inputs and content characteristics, such systems can adeptly address secu- rity requirements and other requirements, such as multimodal SemCom [4]."}, {"title": "B. Channel Estimation for MoE-based SemCom", "content": "Accurate channel estimation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of a SemCom system, particularly as error rates of core semantic meanings have a greater impact. As SemCom evolves from traditional bit-based communication, a prolonged phase of hybrid bit-semantic communication is foreseen. The amalgamation of various semantic codec specialists and the hybrid nature of bit-semantic exchanges present hurdles in accurately estimating Channel State Information (CSI).

Resource Allocation for MoE-based SemCom", "content": "The utilization of SemCom in resource-limited environ- ments like the Internet of Things (IoT) is prevalent due to its capacity to notably diminish communication overhead. In MoE-based SemCom, each additional expert amplifies computational demands, augments storage requirements, and extends communication latency. In certain scenarios, priori- tizing reduced energy consumption may warrant relinquishing unnecessary security measures. Moreover, optimizing storage resources by relocating seldom-used experts to the network edge rather than locally presents an avenue for efficiency. Con- sequently, the investigation into resource allocation assumes significant importance. Exploring the optimal approach for balancing constrained resources and security prerequisites for individual devices emerges as a pertinent future direction."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "Considering the multi-source heterogeneous attacks in the wireless communication environment, this article advocates for integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into Semantic Com- munication (SemCom) to enhance the trustworthiness of 6G networks from the aspects of security and privacy. By incorpo- rating MoE into SemCom, the gating network can dynamically cater to users' varying security and privacy requirements of users by allocating suitable semantic codecs and security measures for each communication instance. To illustrate the efficacy of this integrated system, a case study focusing on vehicular semantic communications with four specific security threats is conducted. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in bolstering security and privacy in 6G networks, thereby laying a strong foundation for trustworthy network infrastructures. Finally, the potential future contribu- tions of MoE for SemCom in advancing 6G networks are discussed, providing insights into the continued impact of MoE in promoting future communication paradigms."}]}

This paper introduces CourseGPT, a generative AI tool designed to support instructors and enhance the educational experiences of undergraduate students. Built on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from Mistral AI, CourseGPT offers continuous instructor support and regular updates to course materials, enriching the learning environment. By utilizing course-specific content, such as slide decks and supplementary readings and references, CourseGPT provides precise, dynamically generated responses to student inquiries. Unlike generic AI models, CourseGPT allows instructors to manage and control the responses, thus extending the course scope without overwhelming details. The paper demonstrates the application of CourseGPT using the CPR E 431: Basics of Information System Security course as a pilot. This course, with its large enrollment and diverse curriculum, serves as an ideal testbed for CourseGPT. The tool aims to enhance the learning experience, accelerate feedback processes, and streamline ad-ministrative tasks. The study evaluates CourseGPT's impact on student outcomes, focusing on correctness scores, context recall, and faithfulness of responses. Results indicate that the Mixtral-8x7b model, with a higher parameter count, outperforms smaller models, achieving an 88.0% correctness score and a 66.6% faithfulness score. Additionally, feedback from former students and teaching assistants on CourseGPT's accuracy, helpfulness, and overall performance was collected. The outcomes revealed that a significant majority found CourseGPT to be highly accurate and beneficial in addressing their queries, with many praising its ability to provide timely and relevant information.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "There is a growing recognition of the transformative po-tential of AI-driven technologies in enhancing academic and student learning experiences as the educational landscape continues to evolve. Integrating intelligent virtual assistants powered by LLMs is a promising solution for improving stu-dent interactions with course materials and seeking academic guidance. Adopting LLM-based assistants in educational set-tings represents a shift towards personalized and interactive learning environments with domain-specific knowledge. These assistants provide personalized support, real-time feedback, and domain-specific knowledge access, enabling deeper stu-dent engagement and more effective learning outcomes.\nThis work evaluates RAG-based-LLM effectiveness as intel-ligent university course assistants. We aim to assess how differ-ent LLM sizes, ranging from 7 billion to 47 billion parameters, impact their ability to assist students with questions regarding the course. We identify the strengths and limitations of each LLM by establishing a shared knowledge base and employing rigorous evaluation methodologies. LLM assessment includes analyzing the correctness, context recall, and faithfulness of responses generated by each LLM within the course's scope. CourseGPT utilizes Mistral LLMs [1], [2].\nCourseGPT is fine-tuned for the Iowa State University CPR E 431: Introduction to Wireless Network Security course. CourseGPT was deployed on a server and provided to a few students who completed the course in previous semesters and a previous teaching assistant. These participants were surveyed on CourseGPT's accuracy, helpfulness, and performance.\nAn LLM assistant can be integrated into a virtual teaching assistant using GPT3. The virtual intelligent teaching assistant system at the framework's core is a voice-enabled helper capable of answering various course-specific questions, such as administrative and logistical questions and course poli-cies [3]. Integrating an RAG-LLM-based assistant within a university system marks a notable advancement in student support mechanisms [4]. The AI-teaching assistant operates like traditional university forums while attending to student inquiries with interactive and informative capabilities.\nIt is worth noting that the recent CourseGPT-zh is in-dependent of our CourseGPT. CourseGPT-zh is a course-oriented education LLM that leverages a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework with prompt opti-mization. CourseGPT-zh introduces a novel method for dis-crete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge, aligning LLM responses with user needs while saving response length [5]. Our CourseGPT involves domain-specific knowledge to deploy as a student assistant that provides answers to questions to specific class-related knowledge.\nThis work is organized as follows: Section III shows CourseGPT's design and implementation technical details. Section IV describes RAG-LLM evaluation methodologies and metrics. RAG-LLM evaluation results and analyses achieved from deploying CourseGPT are described in Section V.

COURSEGPT: IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS", "content": "Undergraduate teaching often necessitates concise instruc-tions within fine-grained modules and more individualized support to guide students step by step, ideally on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. CourseGPT enhances this approach by enabling instructors to create detailed, modular content us-ing its interactive interface. This tool provides students with personalized support through immediate answers and real-time guidance, encouraging them to ask more questions without fear of judgment. Consequently, students can focus on and com-plete each module in a single interactive session, significantly reducing the frustration associated with waiting for responses from instructors or teaching assistants.\nThe immediate and personalized feedback provided by CourseGPT promotes an excellent educational experience by increasing student engagement and productivity. Students are more inclined to seek help and clarification on various topics, knowing they will receive prompt and relevant responses. This not only enhances their understanding of the course material but also builds their confidence in mastering complex subjects. By fostering a more interactive and responsive learning envi-ronment, CourseGPT aligns with any school's strategic goals of promoting educational experience excellence and enhancing knowledge and discovery.\nCourseGPT's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of courses with different instructional materials, including mathematics, programming, and natural language artifacts. The success of similar AI tools, like ChatGPT, across various domains evidences this adaptability. Our pilot class, CPR E 431: Basics of Information System Security, includes all three types of materials, demonstrating CourseGPT's capability to handle diverse content. This pilot will serve as a proof of concept that can be generalized to a broader range of courses, benefiting a larger number of students across the Arts, Sci-ences, and Engineering disciplines. Although the initial pilot will not address materials such as drawings and graphics, future iterations of CourseGPT may expand to include these as well, further broadening its applicability."}, {"title": "B. Enhancing of Students' Learning Outcomes", "content": "CourseGPT will serve as a valuable tool for instructors and students, providing specific guided procedures to implement three student outcomes from ABET: SO1, SO4, and SO7, thereby enhancing specific learning outcomes. This will guide us in designing the tool while offering instructors the necessary procedures to implement them, resulting in an improved student learning experience, regardless of whether the class is intended for ABET accreditation.\nAn ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems: CourseGPT assists instructors in break-ing down their material into three phases. Students will engage in broad, targeted searches, asking multiple questions to iden-tify problems. They will then receive feedback on formulating these problems. Solving the problems requires students to ask more questions and seek similar solutions to validate their own. These activities benefit from CourseGPT's interactive and individualized feedback during real-time sessions.\nAn ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities: Drawing from years of teaching experience, this outcome greatly benefits from CourseGPT by encourag-ing critical thinking. Linking a project's impact to global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts requires long discussions and repeated, focused questions. CourseGPT's real-time, interactive sessions of intelligent discussions sig-nificantly enhance students' understanding of their project's impact on its environment.\nAn ability to acquire and apply new knowledge: Achieving this ability goes beyond class material. Traditional instruction methods are limited to classrooms and the over-whelming information on the internet. CourseGPT allows in-structors to compile supplemental material, facilitating interac-tive discussions between students and CourseGPT. This precise guidance helps students acquire and apply new knowledge effectively.\nIn summary, CourseGPT represents a significant advance-ment in educational technology, providing personalized, real-time support that enhances undergraduate learning experiences and outcomes. By facilitating complex problem-solving, pro-moting ethical responsibilities, and encouraging new knowl-edge acquisition, CourseGPT aligns with every school's strate-gic educational goals. The pilot phase will establish a founda-tion for broader implementation, benefiting a larger cohort of students and setting a new standard for educational excellence in higher education."}, {"title": "III. COURSEGPT IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "CourseGPT expends advanced LLM computational tech-niques with RAGs at the framework's core. RAGs enable knowledge base integration into the generative process. This integration is vital in ensuring generated content relevance and accuracy, especially in a university course environment where new findings and teaching material are added. We chose text embeddings that satisfy our operational constraints to construct a robust knowledge base system while optimizing retrieval precision. This knowledge base guarantees that the retrieved information is relevant and contextually appropriate for the generative tasks. CourseGPT relies on LLMs as they transform raw RAG data and text embeddings into coherent and contextually rich responses to user prompts.\nThis section provides details of each CourseGPT compo-nent, clarifying their contributions and collective impact on the system's functionality. By exploring these elements, we offer insights into how CourseGPT facilitates precise, updated, context-aware information retrieval and generation, setting a new standard for interaction within intelligent systems.

Retrieval Augmented Generation", "content": "RAG-based techniques are crucial for LLM advancement. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive results, there is room for improvement, especially in handling specialized knowledge tasks. RAG addresses this by enhancing LLMS with external, up-to-date information sources. RAGs over-come outdated knowledge and hallucination by combining the LLM's intrinsic knowledge with vast repositories from exter-nal databases [6]. RAGs retrieve relevant document chunks based on searches utilizing semantic similarity calculations, resulting in more accurate and reliable outputs [6]. RAGs are built on retrieval, generation, and augmentation techniques.\nThis work utilizes LLMs' advanced language understanding and generation capabilities as the generative component of the RAG framework to discover critical differences between different LLM models. This approach ensures continuous knowledge updates and domain-specific integration, making RAG a promising solution for domain-specific LLMs."}, {"title": "B. Embeddings", "content": "The effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the retrieved passages used as input to the generator. To ensure the retrieval of pertinent information from the ARA documentation, we utilize conversation chains to start prompting and answering and employ text embeddings to create a retrieval knowledge base for the LLMs.\nText embeddings are critical in enhancing textual data's semantic understanding and representation. Extracted text chunks from the pre-processed data are transformed into high-dimensional vector representations, facilitating more nu-anced similarity assessments and improving the accuracy of passage retrieval using the pre-trained gte-large-en-v1.5 text embeddings model from AliBaba-NLP [7]. These embeddings support a context length of up to 8192. These embeddings were trained through multi-stage contrastive learning. The first stage involves a preliminary Masked Language Modelling pre-training on shorter 800M text pair lengths. The second stage involves data resampling, which reduces the short text propor-tions and a continuation of the Masked Language Modelling pre-training. This model was chosen due to the consideration of its size and its performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard [8].\nCourseGPT trains the RAG-LLM model by incorporating relevant passages from the course textbook, course slide decks, syllabus, schedule, and supplementary materials. This process involves utilizing conversation chains and text em-beddings to process and generate responses. Integrating the RAG component with advanced data extraction techniques enhances CourseGPT's ability to provide contextually rich and accurate responses to user queries relevant to the retrieved knowledge base data. The top-p section headers are searched for retrieval, and the entire content section is retrieved. Top-p sampling chooses from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the probability p. The probability mass is then redistributed among this set of words. The size of the set of words can dynamically increase and decrease according to the next word's probability distribution. We choose the top-p, (p = 0.95), samples for our approach."}, {"title": "C. Mistral LLMs", "content": "LLMs are a robust computational model for performing various natural language processing tasks. These models learn statistical relationships from vast text data during their in-tensive training. LLMs excel at text generation, a form of generative AI. LLMs predict the next token or word given an input text, creating coherent and contextually relevant output. The largest and most capable LLMs are built using a decoder-only transformer architecture [9]. These models are trained on billions of parameters.\nMistral-7b is a 7-billion-parameter language model devel-oped by Mistral AI and is engineered for superior performance and efficiency, which leverages grouped-query attention for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention, to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a reduced inference cost. Mistral-7b achieves a 2x speed improvement for sequences up to 16k with a window of 4k due to its innovative sliding window attention mechanism [1].\nMixtral-8x7b is a Sparse Mixture of Experts language model developed by Mistral AI. Mixtral-8x7b has the same architecture as Mistral-7B, except each layer consists of 8 feedforward blocks. At each layer, a router network selects two feedforward blocks for every token to process the current state and combine their outputs. Each token can access 47B pa-rameters but only uses 13B active parameters during inference due to feedforward blocks. Mixtral-8x7b utilizes a subset of its parameters for each token, allowing for faster inference speeds at low batch sizes and higher throughput at large batch sizes. Mixtral-8x7b's efficient parameter usage ensures competitive performance. Mixtral-8x7b was trained with a context size of 32k tokens [2]."}, {"title": "D. Retrieval Material and Knowledge Base", "content": "The training materials sourced for CourseGPT are essential to refining the RAG-LLM model. The retrieval material in-cludes the course textbook, slide decks, the syllabus and sched-ule, and supplementary resources such as API documentation introductions to command modules. These materials constitute a rich knowledge base relevant to the course curriculum.\nThe training materials offer comprehensive course content coverage with details on topics, concepts, and methodologies relevant to the course. They include APIs associated with the course material, resource specifications, in-depth information on course-related topics, and supplementary information pro-vided to students as optional readings.\nThe research materials were pre-processed and cleaned be-fore fine-tuning.

Each metric provides valuable insights into the LLMs' capabilities, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their practical utility in a real-world education context. Below, we detail the methodologies for computing these metrics."}, {"title": "A. Correctness Scores", "content": "We evaluated answer correctness to determine the accuracy of each LLM's responses to queries. This metric involved comparing the generated answer to the ground truth and as-sessing the level of alignment between the two. A higher score indicates greater accuracy and a closer match to the ground truth. Answer correctness is based on semantic similarity and factual accuracy, combined using a weighted scheme to determine the overall correctness score [10], [11].\nAnswer semantic similarity assesses the semantic resem-blance between the generated answer, $G_A$, and the ground truth, $G_t$. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer [10], [11]. A higher score signifies a higher alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth. Answer semantic similarity is calculated using the embeddings model to vectorize the ground truth answer and the generated answer, then computing the cosine similarity, $S_{cos}$, between the two vectors. The cosine similarity of the embedded, vectorized generated answer, $G_A$, and the embedded, vectorized ground truth, $G_t$, is given as follows:\n$S_{cos} = cos(\\theta) = \\frac{G_t G_A}{||G_t|| ||G_A||}$"}, {"title": "B. Context Recall", "content": "Context recall measures the RAG-LLM's context alignment extent of the retrieved context with the ground truth.

Context recall is calculated using the ground truth and the retrieved context.\nEach sentence in the ground truth answer is analyzed to de-termine if it can be attributed to the retrieved context. Ideally, All sentences in the ground truth answer are attributable to the retrieved context.\nContext recall is calculated as follows:\n$Context Recall = \\frac{G_{tc}}{Number \\space of \\space Sentences \\space in \\space G_t}$"}, {"title": "C. Faithfulness", "content": "Among the metrics evaluated on the LLMs, one important measure is model faithfulness. This metric assesses the accu-racy of the generated answer in terms of factual consistency with the provided context. It is calculated based on the answer and the retrieved context [10], [11]. To be considered faithful, the generated answer must make claims that can be logically deduced from the given context. A set of claims from the generated answer is identified and compared with the given context to assess the faithfulness of the LLMs. The answer is deemed faithful if all the claims can be inferred from the context. Faithfulness is expressed in terms of $N_{Gc}$, the number of claims in the generated answer that can be inferred from the given context, and $N_C$, the total number of claims in the generated answer, as:\n$Faithfulness = \\frac{N_{Gc}}{|N_C|}$"}, {"title": "V. EVALUATION RESULTS", "content": "This work assesses and compares the performance of the RAG-LLMS Mistral-7b and Mixtral-8x7b in answering student questions related to specific course-related material.

Correctness Scores", "content": "Larger models, such as Mixtral-8x7b, have a higher capacity to represent and process complex domain-specific knowledge, including intricate concepts, terminologies, and relationships present in the input context and the shared knowledge base. This capacity enables them to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses across domain-specific queries. Larger models benefit from increased exposure to diverse examples and data during training. This exposure allows them to generalize better and adapt more effectively to varying input contexts and query types within the domain-specific knowledge domain. This exposure also increases accuracy and reliability in generating correct responses across different scenarios and use cases.\nLarger models exhibit greater robustness to noise, ambi-guity, and variability in the input context and the shared knowledge base. They can filter irrelevant information and dis-cern subtle differences, producing more precise and accurate responses.\nThe RAG-LLM model's correctness score distributions across different topics in our test set are shown in Fig. 2. The topics involved information regarding Wireless Security, Authentication, Encryption, Malware, Identity Management, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Information System Secu-rity, Denial-of-Service (DoS), and Access Control, and other topics consisting of more general information not falling into any of the topics mentioned above. Fig. 2 shows that the trend in higher correctness scores depends on the size of the model utilized with the same knowledge base. The \"Others\" topic results have been excluded from Fig. 2 for simplicity.\nOur analysis revealed a significant difference in correctness scores between the RAG-LLMs. Mixtral-8x7b achieved the highest correctness score at 88.0%, followed by Mistral-7b, which scored 78.2%. This outcome shows that models with larger parameter sizes generally exhibit enhanced accuracy with higher correctness in generating contextually appropriate responses. It is worth noting that Mistral-7b performed as well as Mixtral-8x7b in the Authentication, Identity Management, IDS, Information System Security, and DoS topics despite being a smaller model, as seen in Fig. 2. The average RAG-LLM correctness scores for all topics are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe effectiveness of a model in generating correct responses is influenced by the distribution and training data coverage related to different topics within the knowledge base. Both models were exposed to diverse and representative examples for specific topics during training. As such, the smaller model learns to generalize and perform comparably to the larger model in those areas.\nSmaller models may benefit from greater sample efficiency, requiring fewer examples or less training data to learn effec-tively. The smaller model may extract and leverage relevant patterns and information efficiently, leading to comparable performance to the larger model if the training data for specific topics is limited but informative.\nThe LLM model performance depends on its size and the optimization techniques and strategies employed during training. Effective regularization, fine-tuning, and optimization strategies can mitigate the limitations of smaller models and enhance their performance across various topics within the knowledge base. Both models share the same underlying architecture."}, {"title": "B.

Mixtral-8x7b attained a faithfulness score of 66.6%, and Mistral-7b scored 60.2%. Our evaluation shows that using larger LLMs increases the faithfulness scores con-siderably and that the generated answer accuracy regarding factual consistency with the provided context is much higher than in smaller model sizes. A larger LLM has a higher ca-pacity to capture and understand complex patterns in language due to its increased number of parameters and layers. This enhanced capacity enables larger LLMs to generate text that more closely resembles human-authored text and maintains higher faithfulness to the input prompt or context.\nIn domain-specific applications like CourseGPT, accuracy and reliability are crucial. Students rely on CourseGPT for accurate information and guidance on course content, assign-ments, and exams.

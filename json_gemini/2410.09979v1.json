{"title": "Facial Width-to-Height Ratio Does Not Predict Self-Reported Behavioral Tendencies", "authors": ["Michal Kosinski"], "abstract": "A growing number of studies have linked facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) with various antisocial or violent behavioral tendencies. However, those studies have predominantly been laboratory based and low powered. This work reexamined the links between fWHR and behavioral tendencies in a large sample of 137,163 participants. Behavioral tendencies were measured using 55 well-established psychometric scales, including self-report scales measuring intelligence, domains and facets of the five-factor model of personality, impulsiveness, sense of fairness, sensational interests, self-monitoring, impression management, and satisfaction with life. The findings revealed that fWHR is not substantially linked with any of these self-reported measures of behavioral tendencies, calling into question whether the links between fWHR and behavior generalize beyond the small samples and specific experimental settings that have been used in past fWHR research.", "sections": [{"title": "Keywords", "content": "facial width-to-height ratio, fWHR, five-factor model, personality, intelligence, satisfaction with life, impulsiveness, sense of fairness, impression management, self-monitoring, sensational interests, open data"}, {"title": "", "content": "A growing number of studies have linked facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR; Weston, Friday, & Li\u00f2, 2007) with various antisocial or violent behavioral tendencies in men, but not in women. For example, Hehman, Leitner, Deegan, and Gaertner (2013) found that fWHR corre-lated positively with explicit (but not implicit) racial prejudice in a sample of 70 males, r = .21, 95% confi-dence interval (CI) = [\u2212.03, .43], p = .04, one-tailed. Stirrat and Perrett (2012) found that broader-faced males were more self-sacrificing when competing with other groups, n = 15, r = .53, 95% CI = [.02, .82], p =.04, but were less self-sacrificing when competing within their own group, n = 17, r = -.50, 95% CI = [\u2212.79,-.03], p = .04. In another study, Stirrat and Perrett (2010) found that broader-faced men (but not women) were more likely to exploit the trust of others in a trust game, n = 36, r = -.40, 95% CI = [\u2212.64, \u2212.08], p = .015, but were not less trusting themselves. Haselhuhn, Wong, Ormiston, Inesi, and Galinsky (2014) reported a posi-tive correlation between facial width and negotiation success among men, n = 23 dyads, \u03b2 = 0.43, p = .04. Broader-faced men, but not women, have also been shown to be more likely to cheat when reporting dice rolls, n = 146, t(144) = \u22121.97, p = .05 (Geniole, Keyes, Carr\u00e9, & McCormick, 2014); to deceive in a negotiation game, n = 51, b = 7.17, p = .04 (Haselhuhn & Wong, 2012); and to adopt an aggressive strategy in a com-puter game, n = 37, F(2, 34) = 3.6, p = .04 (Carr\u00e9 &McCormick, 2008). Studies have also shown that fWHRis positively correlated with penalty minutes incurred by male hockey players, n = 21, r = .54, 95% CI = [.14,.79], p = .01 (Carr\u00e9 & McCormick, 2008), and with male and female alpha status in capuchin monkeys, n = 34, b = 7.09, p = .03 (Lefevre et al., 2014).Unfortunately, fWHR research suffers from three major limitations. First, the mechanism underlying the observed links between fWHR and behavior remains unknown.

The five-factor model has previously been shown to be a good predictor of behaviors typically linked with fWHR, such as criminal acts, antisocial behavior, suicide attempts, substance abuse, behavioral problems in ado-lescent boys, and prejudice (Ozer & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2006;Sibley & Duckitt, 2008). Additionally, as part of this study, I developed and tested a computerized approach to com-puting fWHR that was subsequently applied to a much larger sample in Study 2."}, {"title": "Method", "content": "Sample. The data for this study were taken from the myPersonality.org data set (Kosinski, Matz, Gosling, Popov,& Stillwell, 2015). MyPersonality.org was a Facebook app that offered its users a range of psychometric tests and feedback on their scores. MyPersonality.org users could opt in to donate their scores and Facebook profile data,including their profile pictures, to be used in research.The data set obtained from myPersonality.org included2,092,439 profile pictures of 815,884 American, British, and Canadian Facebook users (a given user could have more than one more profile picture). In each profile pic-ture, the location of the face, the outlines of its features,and the orientation of the head were identified using theFace++ computer vision software (Megvii Inc., https://www.faceplusplus.com). The results of the Face++ analysis were used to select a subset of 2,597 images that each contained a single, fully visible face (i.e., no facial land-marks were missing) that was looking directly at the camera (i.e., yaw, pitch, and roll parameters were lower than 1\u00b0)and was characterized by a distance of at least 50 pixels between the landmarks marking the center of the eyes.Next, a hypothesis-blind research assistant reviewed these images and removed those in which the visual quality (contrast, focus, and lighting) was low, the facial outline was obscured by hair or clothing, the facial expression was not neutral, the person was not facing the camera directly, the gender of the participant(in the research assistant's judgment) was inconsistent with the gender reported on his or her Facebook pro-file, or the face clearly did not belong to the participant (a few participants used an image of a popular celebrity as their profile picture). The resulting sample contained 1,703 facial images of 1,692 participants (58% females); participants' median age (obtained from the Facebook profiles) was 28 years (interquartile range = 26-34, range = 20-71).Estimating fWHR. Carr\u00e9 and McCormick's (2008) meth-odology was used to manually estimate the fWHR of each image. Two hypothesis-blind research assistants indepen-dently measured the distance between the cheekbones (the widest central part of the face), as well as the distance between the philtrum and the midbrow, and their esti-mates were then averaged. I computed fWHR by dividing the distance between the cheekbones by the distance between the philtrum and the midbrow. Across partici-pants, the average fWHR was 1.73 (SD = 0.16) for females and 1.83 (SD = 0.17) for males. Interrater agreement was comparable with the agreement achieved in previous studies (e.g., Haselhuhn & Wong, 2012).

This correla-tion, however, ceased to be significant when the analysis controlled for age, r = -.071, p = .058 (age correlated positively with fWHR and negatively with extraversion).The analysis based on computerized fWHR estimates yielded only one weak correlation (see Table 1): with men's conscientiousness, r = .090, p = .005. This cor-relation was even weaker when the analysis controlled for age, r = .060, p = .043 (age correlated positively with both fWHR and conscientiousness).The patterns of correlation with personality were similar for the manual and the computerized fWHR estimates, r = .90, p < .001.

As in Study 1, fWHR correlated only weakly with scores for the five personality domains (|r| ranging from .010 to .075; see Table 1 for r values and 95% CIs); however, those correlations were significant because of the very large number of cases (n = 136,485). The correlations were even weaker when the analysis controlled for age (the decrease in |r| ranged from .01 to .03). Taken together, participants' scores for the five personality domains explained a negligible amount of variance in fWHR: R2 = .010 for females and R\u00b2 = .005 for males.Other significant correlations were equally weak: Estimated fWHR was positively correlated with satisfac-tion with life for both men, r = .074, p < .01, and women, r = .085, p < .001. Results for the Sensational Interests Questionnaire showed that fWHR correlated negatively with the Violent-Occult and Occult Credu-lousness scales for both men and women, and nega-tively with the Intellectual Recreation scale for women (rs ranging from -.040 to -.123). Among the personality facets, the only significant correlation was the one for men's adventurousness, r = .133, p = .047; this relation-ship ceased to be significant, however, when the analy-sis controlled for multiple comparisons (using Holm correction). Intelligence, impulsiveness, self-monitor-ing, sense of fairness, and impression management were not significantly correlated with fWHR. Control-ling for age and race (estimated using the Face++ algo-rithm) did not substantially change the results (see Table1 for correlations between age and fWHR). Similarly, there were no substantial nonmonotonic relationships between fWHR and any of the psychological traits.The correlations observed in this study remained weak even when corrected for attenuation caused by the limited reliability of the psychometric question-naires and fWHR estimates. For example, one of the strongest correlations, between fWHR and women's conscientiousness, increased from .075 to .101 when corrected for attenuation."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Overall, the few weak relationships found in this study do not seem to support the links between fWHR and antisocial or violent behavioral tendencies among men observed in past fWHR research. First, in Study 2, all the significant correlations were stronger for women than for men, which contradicts the notion that fWHR is more strongly related to male behavioral tendencies."}, {"title": "Action Editor", "content": "Brent W.

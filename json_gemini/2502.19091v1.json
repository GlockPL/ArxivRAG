{"title": "NEXUS: A LIGHTWEIGHT AND SCALABLE MULTI-AGENT FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLEX TASKS AUTOMATION", "authors": ["Humza Sami", "Mubashir ul Islam", "Samy Charas", "Asav Gandhi", "Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon", "Valerio Tenace"], "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially evolved Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) capabilities, enabling systems that not only automate tasks but also leverage near-human reasoning capabilities. To achieve this, LLM-based MASs need to be built around two critical principles: (i) a robust architecture that fully exploits LLM potential for specific tasks\u2014or related task sets and (ii) an effective methodology for equipping LLMs with the necessary capabilities to perform tasks and manage information efficiently. It goes without saying that a priori architectural designs can limit the scalability and domain adaptability of a given MAS. Furthermore, complex MAS architectures may rely on overcomplex code implementations, thus making reusability of the same codebase to other scenarios near to impossible.\nTo address these challenges, in this paper we introduce Nexus: a lightweight Python framework designed to easily build and manage LLM-based MASs. Nexus introduces several innovations, with key contributions summarized as follows: (i) a flexible multi-supervisor hierarchy: Nexus supports hierarchical architectures with a global supervisor orchestrating the overall workflow and delegating subsets of tasks to specialized supervisors, each controlling a smaller group of agents. This divide-and-conquer approach enables efficient handling of highly complex tasks and improves scalability; (ii) a simplified workflow design: users can design custom architectures and workflows through YAML files, thus drastically reducing, if not completely eliminating, the need for programming expertise; and (iii) easy installation and open-source flexibility: Nexus can be installed via pip and is distributed under a permissive open-source license, allowing users to freely modify and extend its capabilities\".\nExperimental results demonstrate that architectures built with Nexus exhibit state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains. In coding tasks, Nexus-driven MASs achieve a 99% pass rate on HumanEval and a flawless 100% on VerilogEval-Human, outperforming cutting-edge reasoning language models such as 03-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Moreover, these architectures display robust proficiency in complex reasoning and mathematical problem solving, achieving correct solutions for all randomly selected problems from the MATH dataset. In the realm of multi-objective optimization, Nexus-based architectures successfully address challenging timing closure tasks on designs from the VTR benchmark suite, while guaranteeing, on average, a power saving of nearly 30%.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Since their inception in the 1980s, Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have become foundational in Distributed Artificial Intelligence, enabling the decomposition of complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components executed by autonomous agents [1,2]. These agents draw on historical knowledge, interactions with other agents, and environmental cues to make decisions and act autonomously. This built-in autonomy and flexibility distinguish MASs from"}, {"title": "2 Background & Related Work", "content": "This section provides a concise overview of how MASs have evolved. We begin by summarizing their origins and pinpointing the key milestones that have propelled modern MASs into one of the most promising approaches for achieving advanced integrated intelligence. However, it is worth noting that many recent advances in LLM-based"}, {"title": "2.1 The Origin of Multi-Agent Systems", "content": "As already mentioned earlier, a MAS architecture, depicted in Figure 1-a, comprises multiple agents capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning about both local states and shared objectives, and executing actions in parallel to achieve a common goal. By distributing tasks among agents, a MAS leverages specialized capabilities and diverse perspectives, often yielding more robust solutions [21]. Early conceptualizations of MASs emerged during the study of distributed problem-solving in the 1980s, spurred by the notion that coordinated groups of autonomous entities can achieve more efficient and reliable outcomes than individuals working alone. Foundational work by Minsky [22], Wooldridge and Jennings [23], and Stone and Veloso [24] established the core principles of agent autonomy, collaboration, and decentralized decision-making. Over the ensuing decades, researchers addressed fundamental challenges in agent-to-agent communication, exploring topics such as task allocation [25], negotiation protocols [26, 27], and conflict resolution mechanisms [28]."}, {"title": "2.2 LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Systems", "content": "Recent advances in LLMs have reignited interest in MASs by enabling more sophisticated reasoning, natural language communication, and advanced planning. While traditional MASs often relied on symbolic or rule-based methods for coordination and decision-making [29,30], modern LLMs can interpret complex instructions, generate contextually relevant responses, and adapt naturally to diverse communication protocols. This significantly reduces the need for manually crafted dialogue policies and negotiation strategies. Several works have already demonstrated that LLMs can serve as the backbone of MASs. For instance, Park et al. [31] illustrate how LLM-powered agents simulate dynamic social interactions by reasoning about internal goals and social norms. These agents can generate messages to coordinate with others, interpret feedback, and refine their plans in real time, aligning more seamlessly with human-like communication standards [32]. Consequently, they are inherently better equipped to tackle complex tasks requiring contextual understanding, creative reasoning, or dynamic problem-solving."}, {"title": "2.3 ReAct: Reasoning and Action", "content": "In parallel with the evolution of MASs and LLMs, researchers have sought to render each agent's reasoning process more explicit and adaptable. One notable approach is the ReAct paradigm [33] (short for \u201cReasoning + Act\u201d), originally introduced for single-agent systems, as depicted in Figure 1-b. ReAct structures an agent's decision-making into an iterative cycle that goes as follows: (i) observe, where the agent receives new information from its environment or other agents; (ii) reason, where the agent produces a chain-of-thought (CoT), often internally or in a hidden state, to determine the next step; and (iii) act, where the agent executes a specific action, such as calling a tool, sending"}, {"title": "2.4 Next-Generation MAS Architectures", "content": "Although ReAct was originally conceived for single-agent scenarios, its design naturally extends to multi-agent systems, where each agent is supported by an LLM (see Figure 1-c). In this setting, each agent follows a ReAct-style loop to process observations, perform internal reasoning, and act, such as by communicating with other agents or invoking external tools. This integration yields powerful synergies, including:\n\u2022 Enhanced Coordination: LLM-based agents can communicate in natural language to negotiate plans, share partial solutions, or request assistance.\n\u2022 Iterative Reasoning and Action: The ReAct cycle ensures that each agent's CoT remains flexible, context-aware, and up-to-date as it receives new inputs from the environment or from other agents.\n\u2022 Meta-Cognitive Techniques: Approaches such as reflection [33], task decomposition [34,35], and dynamic tool creation [36] can be layered on top of the ReAct loop to enable deeper analysis, more systematic planning, and specialized behaviors.\nThese developments clearly point towards a future where MASs, enhanced by LLMs and meta-cognitive processes like ReAct, can handle sophisticated teamwork and autonomous problem-solving at scales once deemed intractable for traditional MAS approaches. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that multi-agent setups are particularly effective for tasks such as GUI automation [37\u201339] and automatic code debugging [40\u201342], just to name a few, illustrating a rapidly evolving landscape of possibilities."}, {"title": "2.5 Modern MAS Frameworks", "content": "These advancements have led to the emergence of various toolkits and frameworks aimed at simplifying the design and deployment of agentic workflows. Projects such as AutoGPTb [43] and HuggingGPT [44] offer automated pipelines for task decomposition and tool usage. However, they predominantly rely on single-agent paradigms with modular sub-routine execution rather than on fully decentralized, multi-agent collaboration. Other open-source initiatives, including LangGraph [45], AutoGen [46], crewAI [47], Dynamiq [48], Magentic-One [49], and Haystack [50], provide more customizable infrastructures for building multi-agent systems, although they typically require significant coding expertise. By contrast, commercial offerings sometimes feature no-code interfaces, yet often lack transparent integration paths for broader automation.\nIn addressing this gap, the proposed Nexus framework offers a twofold solution. First, it streamlines the creation and prototyping of complex agentic structures by means of YAML files, significantly reducing the programming expertise required to design architectures for complex problems. Second, it provides straightforward integration with software automation environments\u2014typically built on top of shell interfaces\u2014thereby supporting end-to-end automated workflows out-of-the-box. Designed with maximum flexibility in mind, Nexus accommodates multiple supervisors (or orchestrators) within its hierarchical architecture, facilitating the management of highly complex tasks while enhancing decentralization and collaborative problem-solving. All these features distinguish Nexus from existing frameworks and open new avenues for scalable, automated design and deployment across diverse domains."}, {"title": "3 Nexus: A Scalable Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture", "content": "The Nexus architecture is a modular design that integrates a single root Supervisor agent alongside multiple Task Supervisors and Worker agents. These components are arranged within a hierarchical execution graph to ensure efficient task delegation, flexibility, and scalability. The remainder of this section details the architecture's core components, overall operational workflow, and distinguishing features."}, {"title": "3.1 Core Components and Structure", "content": "Nexus architectures rely on a single root Supervisor that mediates interactions between the user and the network of agents. Its primary responsibilities include: (i) task decomposition, which involves breaking high-level prompts into actionable subtasks; (ii) agent selection, where subtasks are delegated to the most appropriate Worker agent (or Task Supervisor, when instantiated) based on each agent's specialization; and (iii) result aggregation, i.e., collecting outputs from delegated subtasks and synthesizing them into a cohesive final response."}, {"title": "3.2 Multi-Loop Workflow", "content": "Nexus introduces an iterative process for task decomposition and execution, organized into three primary interaction loops, as depicted in Figure 2 (numbered circled arrow markers).\nFirst Loop: User-Supervisor Interaction. In the first loop, the user provides a high-level prompt to the Supervisor. The Supervisor interprets the request and outlines an initial task execution plan while soliciting user feedback to ensure that the evolving plan remains aligned with the user's objectives. This iterative exchange continues until the Supervisor is ready either to delegate subtasks to other agents or to finalize a solution.\nSecond Loop: Supervisor-Agent Coordination. In the second loop, the Supervisor (or a Task Supervisor, when applicable) assigns well-defined subtasks to Worker agents based on their specific characteristics and specialization. The Worker agents then generate intermediate outputs by interacting with the tools and resources available within their designated working environments. If a Worker fails to produce satisfactory results or encounters a bottleneck, the Supervisor revises the subtask instructions or reallocates the task to another agent. This iterative reassessment continues until the subtasks collectively meet the established quality criteria.\nThird Loop: Intra-Agent Operations. The third loop operates within each Worker agent's internal environment. Upon receiving its assigned subtask, a Worker iteratively leverages relevant tools, local data structures, or external knowledge bases to refine its intermediate output. Once a sufficiently polished solution is achieved, the Worker relays the result back to its supervisor for integration or final synthesis."}, {"title": "3.3 Framework Installation and Basic Usage", "content": "To ensure reproducibility and encourage widespread adoption, Nexus is distributed as an installable Python package.

Communication Controls", "content": "In 6G, a wireless network enables the communications among spatially dispersed nodes of a control system with enhanced flexibility and mobility. For such a wireless NCS, the choice of communication parameters needs to guarantee the stability robustness. The key parameters of the communication sub-system include transmit power and frequency band. The challenge, however,"}, {"title": "B. Control Communications", "content": "In the control sub-system, the primary control parameters consist of data sampling and pro-cessing as well as node scheduling. Constrained by the limited radio resources, the wireless communications introduce the latency and the unreliability. This necessitates the optimization of control parameters to ensure that the control sub-system achieves a certain performance, while being resilient to the impairments caused by the communication sub-system. However, the majority of existing efforts are built upon the simplistic and restrictive communication models. For a practical wireless NCS, the communication and control parameters are highly correlated with one another. That is, the changes in control parameters simultaneously lead to the variations in radio resource consumption, and the vice versa. It is natural that the neglect of interactions between the communication and the control sub-systems fails guaranteeing the optimized control performance."}, {"title": "C. Co-Design under Dynamics", "content": "As opposed to separately designing the communication and the control sub-systems, the co-design of a wireless NCS offers a means to achieve the desired control performance. Such a co-design presents an immediate challenge of increased computational complexity resulting from the expansion of parameter dimensions. In essence, the communication and control co-design is a sequential decision-making process that adapts over time to the dynamics of a wireless NCS. These dynamics not only emanate from the temporally and spatially fluctuating quality of communication and availability of radio resources, but are also intertwined with the operations of the control sub-system. However, it is often not realistic to fully model the underlying dynamics of a real-world wireless NCS. Additionally, deriving an accurate model that well"}, {"title": "III. LEARNING FRAMEWORK FORTIFIED WITH LLMS", "content": "In line with the previous discussions, this section aims to establish a learning framework for the communication and control co-design in the context of 6G networks. The learning framework takes into account the sequential interactions between the communication and the control sub-systems over the time horizon. Unlike the static environment assumption prevalent in most of the existing literature, we employ a discrete-time MDP to capture the dynamics inherent in a wireless NCS."}, {"title": "A. Mathematical Formulation of an MDP", "content": "In an MDP as depicted in Fig. 1, an agent (i.e., the decision-maker) engages in continuous interactions with the surrounding environment across the discrete time points. The environment can be characterized by a finite set of states. At each time point, the agent observes the current state, which is taken as the input to the decision-making policy that outputs an action from a set of feasible actions. After executing the action, the surrounding environment transits from the current state to the next state, and meanwhile, the agent receives an instantaneous feedback. Note that given an action under a state, the state transition adheres to the probability distribution over all possible subsequent states. The feedback, which can be a reward or a cost signal, quantifies the direct impact of an action on a state. Ultimately, the objective of the agent is to solve a"}, {"title": "B. Proposed Learning Framework", "content": "The fundamental elements of a single-agent or multi-agent MDP formulation reveal the significant challenges in deriving an optimal decision-making policy, namely, the state rep-resentation from high-dimensional observations, the abstraction of action domains, the lack of a well-structured feedback model, and the need for an accurate controlled state transition probability function. Fortunately, RL techniques learn the optimal policy without the controlled state transition probability. However, in a practical wireless NCS, it remains daunting to employ RL to optimize the communication and control co-design due to the infinite problem size, the system intrinsic limitations as well as the rigorous control performance assessment."}, {"title": "1) Integration of LLMs:", "content": "In this work, we propose a learning framework, which harnesses and integrates the potential of LLMs to enhance the remote control performance over the 6G wireless networks under dynamics. LLMs, typically recognized as a variant of the Transformer neural network architecture, are characterized by billions of parameters and training on internet-scale data. As the number of parameters and the volume of training data grow, LLMs tend to exhibit the capabilities of context sensitivity, logical reasoning, and nuance understanding [11], [12]. Specifically, an intelligent controller (i.e., the learning agent) fortified with an LLM is able to effectively fuse the radio frequency (RF) and non-RF modalities [13], which interpret the real-world wireless NCS. With the unified multi-modal data, the reasoning capability then facilitates the decision-makings (i.e., the actions in terms of communication and control co-design) through the LLM as the policy. Additionally, the LLM allows the controller to strike a balance between instantaneous objectives, while being well-aligned with the optimized expected long-term control performance."}, {"title": "2) Data-Driven Policy Optimization:", "content": "Nevertheless, the training of an optimal communication and control co-design policy can still be a significant challenge during the RL process in practice. On one hand, the LLM-empowered controller collects experiences from repeatedly interacting with the wireless NCS to update the policy parameters. Herein, an experience corresponds to a tuple of current state representation, action, immediate feedback and subsequent state representa-tion. On the other hand, the experience collection requires the real-time policy implementation. Such parallel policy parameter updating and experience collection are compounded into the \"chicken and egg\" dilemma, which is central to the online RL. However, the continuously collecting online experience data is time-consuming and costly. Moreover, iterative policy pa-rameter updating frequently generates random actions that pose risks to operating a real-world wireless NCS. Despite being empowered by a pre-trained LLM, our proposed learning framework optimizes the communication and control co-design policy in an offline manner, leveraging a static dataset of a number of experiences (e.g., from the regular system operations). Different from the online RL, the data-driven policy optimization during offline RL training relaxes the dependence on the interactions with the wireless NCS."}, {"title": "3) Case Study on Age of Semantics-Aware Communication and Control Co-Design:", "content": "In a wireless NCS, such as smart manufacturing [16] and intelligent transportation [17], to mention a few, it is crucial for the remote controller to keep up-to-date information of the physical process of interest, requiring the sensor to regularly update the status. The concept of AoI, which measures the time since the most recent status update was received, has attracted extensive attention in the literature [18]. However, Aol overlooks the semantics behind each status update. This limitation motivates the proposal of age of semantics (AoS) to dig out the connection between the semantics at the sensor and the timely inference at the remote controller. As a case study, we apply our proposed learning framework to the communication and control co-design with the purpose of"}, {"title": "System Model.", "content": "We concentrate on a discrete-time wireless NCS, where with the help of multiple half-duplex relays and an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), the sensor updates the physical process of interest to the remote controller through the delivery of semantic samples. The status of the process of interest is modelled using a finite-state Markov chain. We assume that the interval 7 between any two consecutive time points is constant. At each time point, the remote controller decides whether the sensor should sample the process status. If the process is sampled, the generated status update is compressed with the semantic extraction module. Aided by the IRS, the sensor first transmits the semantic sample to the selected relay, and during the remaining time until the subsequent time point, the selected relay then forwards the received semantic sample to the remote controller in a decode-forward mode. The remote controller is acknowledged if and only if the true process status aligns with the inference result of the status update, which is reconstructed from the semantic sample. At the sensor, the energy is consumed by status sampling, semantic extraction and semantic sample transmission. Considering the physical constraints, the transmit energy consumption can be calculated using the frequency bandwidth, the maximum transmit power, the channel gains to the selected relay and the IRS, as well as the data size of the semantic sample. To quantify the semantics freshness at the remote controller, we define AoS as the time duration since the perfect inference of the process status."}, {"title": "Problem Formulation and Solution.", "content": "Under the states {st : t = 1,2,......} across the dis-crete time points t = 1,2,......, the goal of the remote controller is to device a policy that optimizes the actions {at = \u03c0(st) : t = 1,2,......} such that the expected long-term reward V(s) = \u0395\u03c0[\u03a3_t=(\u03b3)^(i-t) * r(st, at)|st = s] is maximized. Herein, the expectation Er is calculated with respect to the probability distribution induced by \u03c0. \u03b3 \u0395 [0,1) denotes the discount factor. At each time point t, the state st represents the information of AoS, channel gains of all the links and sensor-relay association state, the action at determines the status sampling and relay selection decisions, while r(st, at) is the immediate reward signal of realized AoS at the remote controller and energy consumption at the sensor. It is ready to see that the AoS-aware communication and control co-design falls into a single-agent MDP. To solve the optimal policy, the conventional online RL requires the remote controller to explore any valid actions to access the wireless NCS in real-time, potentially increasing the collapse danger. Though the assumptions made for simplification in this case study diminish the roles of LLMs, our proposed learning framework enables the remote controller to learn the optimal"}, {"title": "IV. OPEN ISSUES AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS", "content": "In the preceding section, we formulate the problem of communication and control co-design in 6G as an MDP, and propose an offline RL based solution framework that is fortified by LLMs. Our learning framework explores the promising potentials of integrating an LLM as the state descriptor, the action recommender and the feedback designer. In what follows, we delve into the open issues and future research directions for implementing our learning framework, spanning from modelling and theoretical considerations to practical realities."}, {"title": "Multi-Modal Feature Abstraction", "content": "Due to the increasingly complex infrastructure deploy-ments in the 6G era, we lack a deep understanding of the wireless NCS, which is challenging to be exactly described using the existing statistical models. Spurred by the advances in machine learning and computer vision, both RF and non-RF modalities can be exploited to enrich the state observations. However, efficiently fusing multiple data modalities to extract the semantics is critical for system feature abstraction. Through the integration of an LLM, the controller is capable of retrieving the accessible state representations. Nevertheless, open issues remain in compression of LLMs for practical implementations on resource-constrained nodes and generalization of LLMs to heterogeneous data modalities."}, {"title": "Communication and Control Interactions", "content": "The selection of an action at each time point influences both the immediate and the future control performance under the MDP formu-lation of communication and control co-design. To strike an interactive balance between the communication and control sub-systems, LLMs leverage the state information and act as a prior to propose a high-level compact action space. As such, the controller proceeds to bottom out the low-level actions, which accelerates the offline training processing of our learning framework. It remains a bottleneck how to identify the space of actions that is highly relevant to the one-shot and long-term objectives conditioned on the state information at any time point."}, {"title": "Feedback Hacking Risks", "content": "Due to the communication and control interactions, the control performance is multi-attributed and each of the attributes contributes to the feedback (i.e., the reward signal or the cost signal). These attributes include the measurements of network-induced latency, data loss, quantization errors in signal sampling, and various effects from the system dynamics. Yet there does not exist a rigorous method for the definition of a per-time point feedback function that quantitatively specifies and combines all such attributes into a single real-valued number. Even with the feedback function trained by an LLM, it is still possible to extrapolate the trajectory of undesirable actions that optimize merely the accumulated feedback but not the control performance, due to the feedback hacking [24]."}, {"title": "Non-Stationary Generalization", "content": "During the offline training of our learning framework, the policy is estimated upon the basis of the empirical policy, which is calculated from the static dataset under the assumption of a stationary wireless NCS. When the statistics of system dynamics changes (i.e., in a non-stationary wireless NCS), the control performance resulting from implementing the estimated policy cannot be guaranteed. Without the loss of generality, a non-stationary wireless NCS can be mathematically represented through a set of MDPs with independent state transition probabilities. Meta learning assists in finding a meta policy that quickly adapts to a new MDP [25]. To enhance the control performance, the meta policy needs to be fine-tuned with the newly collected interaction experiences. It is important to notice that during the fine-tuning, the meta policy avoids random actions."}, {"title": "Data Security and Privacy in Implementation", "content": "An LLM, which takes any modality data as the input, plays a crucial role in our proposed learning framework, giving rise to the security and privacy concerns related to data collection/transmission, control signalling, and so forth. Due to the openness of a wireless communication network, the implementation of our learning framework is vulnerable to the adversarial attacks. How to detect and counteract the attacks for the protection of a wireless NCS in 6G is a direction worth exploring. In addition, the training of our learning framework relies on massive datasets. To prevent the severe and unintended consequences from harmful data, it is imperative to deploy robust data validation techniques to remove the sensitive information."}, {"title": "V.

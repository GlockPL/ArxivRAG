Introduction", "content": "Living in a social world, we must be able to govern our own actions with respect to the norms of other agents and institutions. For instance, when determining if you should help your sister cook, you ought to consider her norms, for she may have told you not to intervene. However, the dynamic nature of our social environment often produces conflicts between norms. That is, the same action may seem to be both required and prohibited (or optional). Your sister may have said weeks ago, \"Do not help me cook\" yet just now said, \u201cHelp me cook these vegetables.\u201d What should you do? To make this determination, you must be capable of detecting and resolving such conflicts quickly.\nIn this paper, we present the Defeasible Deontic Inheritance Calculus (DDIC), a formalism for automatically resolving a continuous stream of possibly conflicting norms. We aim to unify recent developments within the normative multi-agent systems (NMAS) community (Santos et al., 2017) with more theoretical work on deontic and defeasible logic (Horty, 1994). We specifically show that the resolution strategies common to NMAS can be explained under deontic inheritance given that we incorporate defeasibility. We thus advance the state of the art in automated norm conflict detection and resolution.\nWe start by providing background on norms and default and deontic logic. Next, we formalize norm conflict resolution with defeasible deontic inheritance in DDIC. We then prove that DDIC axiomatizes common resolution strategies, further revealing an existing strategy as a red herring. We conclude with a discussion of future research."}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "A norm (also called a normative belief) is defined here as an agent's evaluative attitude of a behavior in a given context. For instance, \u201cLeo believes cooking in the morning is impermissible.\u201d More formally, a norm is a tuple (A, B, C, D), where A is an agent holding the belief, B and C are formal representations of a behavior and context, and D is a deontic modal $ \u2208 {Obl, Opt, Imp}$ (taken as \"Obligatory\u201d, \u201cOptional\u201d, and \u201cImpermissible\u201d). Similar formal representations for norms are used in cognitive science and AI research (Bello & Malle, 2023; Olson & Forbus, 2023), normative multi-agent systems (Santos et al., 2017; Andrighetto et al., 2010; Bringsjord & Sundar, 2013), and conditional deontic logics (van Fraassen, 1972; Casta\u00f1eda, 1989).\nThe grounds of application of a norm consists of all acts or behaviors in which that norm applies (Elhag et al., 1999). Two norms then conflict at a context when they share application grounds, but their deontic statuses are inconsistent. For instance, the obligation to help your sister and the prohibition against helping her cook, both share the application \u201chelping cook\", and thus seemingly conflict. Various norm conflict types thus arise from the intricate relationships between behaviors, contexts, and deontic statuses. Building on ideas from Ross (1958) and those of the multi-agent community, two norms can conflict in three ways (visualized in Figure 1):\nDirect Conflict (Ross's Total-Total): Two norms directly conflict at context C when their behaviors are equivalent, their contexts intersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e., they have identical application grounds at C but make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nIndirect Conflict (Ross's Total-Partial): Two norms indirectly conflict at context C when the behavior of one norm entails (and is not equivalent to) the behavior of the other, their contexts intersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e., the application grounds of one norm subsumes the other at C but they make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nIntersecting Conflict (Ross's Intersection): Two norms conflict at intersection S in context C, when their behaviors intersect at S (and neither behavior subsumes the other), their contexts intersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e., their application grounds share only a proper subset and make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nThe ability to resolve such conflicts is fundamental for cohesive social interaction. Thus, various strategies have been developed for multi-agent systems. The three heuristics commonly deployed (Santos et al., 2017) are: Lex Specialis\u2014prioritize the most specific norm; Lex Posterior\u2014prioritize the most recent norm; and Lex Superior\u2014prioritize the highest authority. Approaches then iteratively apply such heuristics to yield a conflict free set of norms.\""}, {"title": "2.1 Standard Deontic Logic and Deontic Inheritance", "content": "Central to our approach for detecting norm conflicts is the principle of Inheritance (Ross, 1941), or OB-RM, from standard deontic logic (SDL). We show that this principle can be used to determine if and where norms conflict. Briefly, the semantics of SDL draw upon Kripke-style possible world semantics (Kripke, 1963). SDL grounds deontic modality in the concept of Ideal worlds, captured by an accessibility relation R over possible worlds. Thus, xRy holds that world y is Ideal, relative to world x. Given these semantics, Obl(p) holds at world x if and only if p is true in every ideally accessible world y; Imp(p) holds at world x if p is false at every such ideal world; And Opt(p) holds if p is neither uniformly true nor false at every such world.\nOB-RM can then be derived given SDL's semantics: if \u00ac p \u2192 q, then \u00ac Obl(p) \u2192 Obl(q). Intuitively, if whenever p is true, q is also true, then if p is true at all ideally accessible worlds, q must also be true at all ideally accessible worlds. Though we do not ground deontics in possible world semantics here, the idea of deontic inheritance is central to our approach."}, {"title": "2.2 Defeasible Reasoning", "content": "While we utilize deontic inheritance to detect conflicts, we utilize defeasible reasoning to resolve them. We specifically build upon Reiter's (1980) default logic, which introduces the notion of default rules. Unlike standard deductive rules, default rules consider that certain inferences admit to exceptions. Such rules are of the form:\n$\\frac{Prerequisite : Justification_{1,...,n}}{Consequent}$\nA default rule states that if the Prerequisite is true, then we can conclude the Consequent so long as each Justification is consistent with our current beliefs. More formally, given a theory T, we apply default rule $\\frac{P:J1,...,n}{C}$ on theory T when T\u22a2P and for all $J_n$, $T \\nvdash \\neg J_n$, yielding $T = T \u222a {C}$.\nA default theory is a pair of the form (T, D) where T is a set of background logical formulae and D is a set of default rules. To compute conclusions of a theory T, rules from D are exhaustively applied to T until no other rules can be applied. This conclusion set is called an extension of the theory. Theory $T\\vdash C$ when, after applying rules on T, $C \\in T$. However, because rules may be applied in various orders, a theory can produce multiple (possibly contradictory) extensions (e.g., Nixon diamond cases). To avoid such cases, some formalisms define an explicit ordering amongst default rules (Horty, 2007): P(R1, R2) means that R1 is to be applied before R2."}, {"title": "3. Resolving Conflicts via Defeasible Reasoning", "content": "While a norm is defined here as an internal attitude, normative testimony can be taken as its external (natural language) expression. Thus, norms are inferred from normative testimony. For instance, from your sister's first claim, \u201cDo not help me cook\", we might infer she believes we should not help her cook vegetables, while wearing boots, when it's raining. However, such inferences should be defeated when we infer norms from her later claim, \"Help me cook these vegetables.\u201d Detecting and resolving such conflicts is vital to maintaining an accurate mental model of other agents' norms. We formalize this process within a defeasible deontic calculus in the sections below.\""}, {"title": "3.1 The Defeasible Deontic Inheritance Calculus (DDIC)", "content": "Let L be a standard propositional language for which the norms govern\u00b9. Take L to contain the usual symbols of \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, and \u00ac for the operations of conjunction, disjunction, implication, and negation under usual interpretations. Take T as the proposition that is trivially true and turnstile \u22a2 as ordinary logical consequence. We assume a standard transitivity rule amongst implied sentences of L: [a \u2192 b \u2192 c] \u2192 [a \u2192 c]. Such relations are at the heart of deontic inheritance.\nThe language for the Defeasible Deontic Inheritance Calculus (DDIC) is then obtained from L by adding deontic modals for normative beliefs: Obl, Imp and Opt. Normative testimony is represented with accents: \u00d6bl, Imp, Opt. This distinction between an agent's external testimony and their inferred internal belief is critical for computing defeaters. Normative formulae also contain a time parameter, as ordering is important for conflict resolution. We assume this language Time is isomorphic with N given the relations >, <, \u2265, \u2264 under standard interpretation. We formally define DDIC below.\nDefinition 1 (Deontic Language DDIC).

Axiom R1 is a conditional version of OB-RM (a similar axiom \"CPI\" can be found in Olson & Forbus, 2023). It states that if a behavior is stated to be obligatory in a given context, then that agent believes all more general behaviors are obligatory in all more specific contexts. For example, imagine at time t agent a stated, \u201cyou must wear a helmet while on a bike\u201d: $\\ddot{O}bl(a, WearHelmet, OnBike, t)$. Given $[OnBike \\wedge Nighttime] \\rightarrow OnBike$ and $WearHelmet \\rightarrow WearHeadProtection$, we can then infer their belief: $Obl(a, WearHeadProtection, OnBike \\wedge Nighttime, t)$. We have then added defeaters to this inference rule for resolving conflicts. This inference is defeated at some future time when the agent has stated a contradictory normative testimony for a more general behavior in an overlapping context. So, obligations are defeated by normative testimony with more general application grounds. We illustrate this in later sections.\nAxioms R2-4 formalize inheritance for the other deontic modals. While some deontic accounts take obligation as primitive and leave the other deontic modals implicit, we maintain each and derive corresponding inheritance principles from OB-RM. This allows us to represent normative testimony more naturally without nesting negated statements and is also central for computing defeaters. We explain each of these derived inheritance principles below.\nAxiom R3 defines deontic inheritance for prohibitions. It holds that if an agent states that a behavior is impermissible, then that agent believes all more specific behaviors are impermissible as well. Such an inference is defeated when the agent has stated a contradictory normative testimony for an equal or more specific behavior along that entailment path (i.e., either between what was stated and what we are attempting to infer, or under both). Thus, one adds exceptions to prohibitions from below. The inheritance principle underlying this rule is defined and derived from OB-RM below. As a reminder, theorem OB-RM states: if \u22a2 p \u2192 q, then \u22a2 Obl(p) \u2192 Obl(q).\nCorollary 1 (Inheritance for Prohibitions). \u22a2 q \u2192 p, then \u22a2 Imp(p) \u2192 Imp(q).\nProof. As a reminder, in SDL: Obl(\u00acp) \u2261 Imp(p). Assume, q \u2192 p. By Modus Tollens (MT), \u00acp \u2192 \u00acq. Assume Imp(p). By definition, Obl(\u00acp). By OB-RM, Obl(\u00acq). By definition, Imp(q). Therefore, given \u22a2 q \u2192 p, \u22a2 Imp(p) \u2192 Imp(q). \u25a1\nAxioms R2 and R4 then define inheritance for discretionary norms. Together, they hold that a discretionary norm entails that all more general behaviors are non-impermissible, and all more specific behaviors are non-obligatory. This inference is broken out into the two axioms. The former inference (R2) is defeated when a contradictory normative testimony has been stated for an equal or more general behavior. So, like R1, this inference is defeated from above. The latter inference"}, {"title": "A DEFEASIBLE DEONTIC CALCULUS FOR RESOLVING NORM CONFLICTS", "content": "(R4) is defeated when a contradictory normative testimony has been stated for an equal or more specific behavior along that entailment path. So, like R3, R4 gets exceptions added from below. We derive such inferences from OB-RM below.\nCorollary 2 (Inheritance for Discretionary Norms). \u22a2 a \u2192 p \u2192 q, then \u22a2 Opt(p) \u2192 \u00acObl(a)\u2227\u00acImp(q).\nProof (1st conjunct). As a reminder, Opt(p) \u2261 \u00acObl(p)\u2227\u00acImp(p). Assume a \u2192 p and Opt(p). By definition, \u00acObl(p). By MT from OB-RM, \u00acObl(a). Therefore, given a \u2192 p and Opt(p), and thus \u00acObl(p), we can derive \u00acObl(a). \u25a1\nProof (2nd conjunct). Assume p \u2192 q. By MT, \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp. Assume Opt(p). By definition, \u00acImp(p) and thus, \u00acObl(\u00acp). By MT from OB-RM, \u00acObl(\u00acq). By definition, \u00acImp(q). Therefore, given p \u2194 q and Opt(p), and thus \u00acImp(p), we can derive \u00acImp(q). \u25a1\nGiven these axioms, a norm structure of DDIC is a tuple (T, N, D, B, P), where T is a set of logical formulae \u2208 DDIC (the background theory), N is a set of deductive rules = {D1a, D1b}, D is a set of default rules = {R1, R2, R3, R4}, B is a set of deductive rules = {D1c, D1d}, and P is a binary relation on N \u222a D \u222a B. Thus, N contains inference for normative testimony, B contains inference for normative beliefs, and D bridges the gap between the two with defeasible inference. Therefore, normative testimony rules are applied before default rules: \u2200(r \u2208 N, d \u2208 D) P(r, d). This constraint halts inheritance with future normative testimony. Then, once we infer beliefs from testimony, normative belief inference is applied: \u2200(d \u2208 D, r \u2208 B) P(d, r)."}, {"title": "4.

For instance, an agent says, \u201cYou must cook on Monday", "Helping cook in the morning is optional.\u201d At their shared application grounds \"helping cook on Monday morning": "the discretionary norm should be preferred (Lex Specialis).

However, the more specific discretionary norm does add information, as it explicitly labels all more specific behaviors as non-obligatory and all more general behaviors as non-impermissible. Thus, Lex Specialis falls out of deontic inheritance when there is no conflict.\nNext, we consider when a prior discretionary norm governs a more general behavior than a later obligation. The obligation should completely defeat the inferred negated obligations under the discretionary norm. For instance, an agent says, \u201cCooking on Monday is optional\u201d, and then \u201cYou must help cook in the morning.\u201d Their shared application grounds of \"helping cook on Monday morning\" should be obligatory i.e., Lex Posterior.\nTheorem 3 (If the behavior of a prior discretionary norm is more general than that of an obligation at context \u03b4, then the obligation defeats the discretionary norm only on their shared application grounds at \u03b4).

Therefore, when trying to infer downwards from the prior discretionary norm via R4, the more specific obligation stated later defeats it along the path they share\u00b2. However, the downward inference from the discretionary norm that does not share a path with the later obligation remains.\nNext, we consider the reverse order, when a more specific obligation comes prior to a discretionary norm. The obligation should be completely defeated. For instance, an agent says, \u201cYou must help cook on Monday\", and then \u201cCooking in the morning is optional.\u201d Their shared application grounds of \u201chelping cook on Monday morning\u201d should be non-obligatory i.e., Lex Posterior.\""}, {"title": "A DEFEASIBLE DEONTIC CALCULUS FOR RESOLVING NORM CONFLICTS", "content": "Theorem 4 (If the behavior of a prior obligation is more specific behavior than that of a later discretionary norm at context \u03b4, then the discretionary norm completely defeats the obligation at \u03b4).

Regardless of order, the prohibition should be preferred. For instance, an agent says, \u201cYou cannot cook vegetables on Monday\u201d, and \u201cCooking in the morning is optional.\u201d Their shared application grounds of \u201ccooking vegetables on Monday morning", "You cannot cook on Monday": "and then \u201cHelping cook in the morning is optional\u201d. The discretionary norm adds exceptions at their shared grounds", "morning": "defeating the impermissibility i.e., Lex Posterior."}, {"title": "A DEFEASIBLE DEONTIC CALCULUS FOR RESOLVING NORM CONFLICTS", "content": "Theorem 6 (If the behavior of a prior prohibition is more general than that of a later discretionary norm at context \u03b4, then the discretionary norm defeats the prohibition only at their shared application grounds at \u03b4).

Let norm structure N = (T, N, D, B, P), where T = {\u03b4 \u2192 \u03c6, \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c8, t\u2081 < t2 \u2264 tn}.\nStatement Reason\n1 T \u22a2 Imp(C, \u03c6, t\u2081) Assumption\n2 T \u22a2 \u00d6pt(HC, \u03c8, t2) Assumption\n3 T \u22a2 \u00acImp(HC, \u03c8, t2) D1a from (2)\n4 T \u22a2 \u00acImp(HC, \u03b4, tn) R2 from (3), \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c8, & HC \u2192 HC\n5 T \u22a2 Imp(CV, \u03b4, tn) R3 from (1), \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c6, & CV \u2192 C\n6 T \u22a2 Imp(HCV, \u03b4, tn) R3 from (1) defeated by (3), \u03b4 \u2192 \u03c8, & HCV \u2192 HC \u2192 C\nAs shown above, the inheritance from the previous prohibition is correctly halted along the path shared by the discretionary norm via defeaters in R3 i.e. Lex Posterior. However, inheritance at behaviors not along this path remains. That is, the discretionary norm adds exceptions.\nNext, we consider when the discretionary norm is stated first. The strategy here should be to prioritize the prohibition. For instance, an agent says, \u201cHelping cook on Monday is optional", "You cannot cook in the morning.": "heir shared application grounds of", "morning": "re impermissible i.e., Lex Posterior.\nTheorem 7 (If the behavior of a prior discretionary norm is more specific than that of a later prohibition at context \u03b4, then the prohibition completely defeats upwards inference from the discretionary norm at \u03b4).

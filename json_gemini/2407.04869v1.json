Introduction", "content": "Living in a social world, we must be able to govern our own actions with respect to the norms of\nother agents and institutions. For instance, when determining if you should help your sister cook,\nyou ought to consider her norms, for she may have told you not to intervene. However, the dynamic\nnature of our social environment often produces conflicts between norms. That is, the same action\nmay seem to be both required and prohibited (or optional). Your sister may have said weeks ago,\n\"Do not help me cook\" yet just now said, \u201cHelp me cook these vegetables.\u201d What should you do?\nTo make this determination, you must be capable of detecting and resolving such conflicts quickly.\nIn this paper, we present the Defeasible Deontic Inheritance Calculus (DDIC), a formalism for\nautomatically resolving a continuous stream of possibly conflicting norms. We aim to unify recent\ndevelopments within the normative multi-agent systems (NMAS) community (Santos et al., 2017)\nwith more theoretical work on deontic and defeasible logic (Horty, 1994). We specifically show\nthat the resolution strategies common to NMAS can be explained under deontic inheritance given\nthat we incorporate defeasibility. We thus advance the state of the art in automated norm conflict\ndetection and resolution.\nWe start by providing background on norms and default and deontic logic. Next, we formalize\nnorm conflict resolution with defeasible deontic inheritance in DDIC. We then prove that DDIC\naxiomatizes common resolution strategies, further revealing an existing strategy as a red herring.\nWe conclude with a discussion of future research."}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "A norm (also called a normative belief) is defined here as an agent's evaluative attitude of a\nbehavior in a given context. For instance, \u201cLeo believes cooking in the morning is impermissible.\u201d\nMore formally, a norm is a tuple (A, B, C, D), where A is an agent holding the belief, B and C are\nformal representations of a behavior and context, and D is a deontic modal \u2208 {Obl, Opt, Imp}\n(taken as \"Obligatory\u201d, \u201cOptional\u201d, and \u201cImpermissible\u201d). Similar formal representations for norms\nare used in cognitive science and AI research (Bello & Malle, 2023; Olson & Forbus, 2023),\nnormative multi-agent systems (Santos et al., 2017; Andrighetto et al., 2010; Bringsjord & Sundar,\n2013), and conditional deontic logics (van Fraassen, 1972; Casta\u00f1eda, 1989).\nThe grounds of application of a norm consists of all acts or behaviors in which that norm\napplies (Elhag et al., 1999). Two norms then conflict at a context when they share application\ngrounds, but their deontic statuses are inconsistent. For instance, the obligation to help your sister\nand the prohibition against helping her cook, both share the application \u201chelping cook\", and thus\nseemingly conflict. Various norm conflict types thus arise from the intricate relationships between\nbehaviors, contexts, and deontic statuses. Building on ideas from Ross (1958) and those of the\nmulti-agent community, two norms can conflict in three ways (visualized in Figure 1):\nDirect Conflict (Ross's Total-Total): Two norms directly conflict at context C when their\nbehaviors are equivalent, their contexts intersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e.,\nthey have identical application grounds at C but make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nIndirect Conflict (Ross's Total-Partial): Two norms indirectly conflict at context C when the\nbehavior of one norm entails (and is not equivalent to) the behavior of the other, their contexts\nintersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e., the application grounds of one norm\nsubsumes the other at C but they make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nIntersecting Conflict (Ross's Intersection): Two norms conflict at intersection S in context\nC, when their behaviors intersect at S (and neither behavior subsumes the other), their contexts\nintersect at C, and their evaluations are inconsistent. I.e., their application grounds share only a\nproper subset and make inconsistent evaluative claims.\nThe ability to resolve such conflicts is fundamental for cohesive social interaction. Thus,\nvarious strategies have been developed for multi-agent systems. The three heuristics commonly\ndeployed (Santos et al., 2017) are: Lex Specialis prioritize the most specific norm; Lex\nPosterior\u2014prioritize the most recent norm; and Lex Superior\u2014prioritize the highest authority.\nApproaches then iteratively apply such heuristics to yield a conflict free set of norms.\""}, {"title": "2.1 Standard Deontic Logic and Deontic Inheritance", "content": "Central to our approach for detecting norm conflicts is the principle of Inheritance (Ross, 1941),\nor OB-RM, from standard deontic logic (SDL). We show that this principle can be used to determine\nif and where norms conflict. Briefly, the semantics of SDL draw upon Kripke-style possible world\nsemantics (Kripke, 1963). SDL grounds deontic modality in the concept of Ideal worlds, captured\nby an accessibility relation R over possible worlds. Thus, xRy holds that world y is Ideal, relative\nto world x. Given these semantics, Obl(p) holds at world x if and only if p is true in every ideally\naccessible world y; Imp(p) holds at world x if p is false at every such ideal world; And Opt(p)\nholds if p is neither uniformly true nor false at every such world.\nOB-RM can then be derived given SDL's semantics: if \u00acp \u2192 q, then \u00ac Obl(p) \u2192 Obl(q).\nIntuitively, if whenever p is true, q is also true, then if p is true at all ideally accessible worlds, q\nmust also be true at all ideally accessible worlds. Though we do not ground deontics in possible\nworld semantics here, the idea of deontic inheritance is central to our approach."}, {"title": "2.2 Defeasible Reasoning", "content": "While we utilize deontic inheritance to detect conflicts, we utilize defeasible reasoning to resolve\nthem. We specifically build upon Reiter's (1980) default logic, which introduces the notion of\ndefault rules. Unlike standard deductive rules, default rules consider that certain inferences admit\nto exceptions. Such rules are of the form:\n$\\frac{Prerequisite : Justification_{1,...,n}}{Consequent}$\nA default rule states that if the Prerequisite is true, then we can conclude the Consequent so long\nas each Justification is consistent with our current beliefs. More formally, given a theory T, we\napply default rule $\\frac{P:J_{1,...,n}}{C}$ on theory T when T\u22a2P and for all Jn, T \u22ac \u00acJn, yielding T = T \u222a {C}.\nA default theory is a pair of the form (T, D) where T is a set of background logical formulae\nand D is a set of default rules. To compute conclusions of a theory T, rules from D are exhaustively\napplied to T until no other rules can be applied. This conclusion set is called an extension of the\ntheory. Theory T \u22a2 C when, after applying rules on T, C \u2208 T. However, because rules may be\napplied in various orders, a theory can produce multiple (possibly contradictory) extensions (e.g.,\nNixon diamond cases).

Resolving Conflicts via Defeasible Reasoning", "content": "While a norm is defined here as an internal attitude, normative testimony can be taken as its external\n(natural language) expression.

Axiom R1 is a\nconditional version of OB-RM (a similar axiom \"CPI\" can be found in Olson & Forbus, 2023). It\nstates that if a behavior is stated to be obligatory in a given context, then that agent believes all\nmore general behaviors are obligatory in all more specific contexts. For example, imagine at time\nt agent a stated, \u201cyou must wear a helmet while on a bike\u201d: \u00d6bl(a,WearHelmet, OnBike, t).\nGiven [OnBike \u2227 Nighttime] \u2192 OnBike and WearHelmet \u2192 WearHeadProtection, we can\nthen infer their belief: Obl(a, WearHeadProtection, OnBike \u2227 Nighttime,t). We have then\nadded defeaters to this inference rule for resolving conflicts. This inference is defeated at some\nfuture time when the agent has stated a contradictory normative testimony for a more general\nbehavior in an overlapping context. So, obligations are defeated by normative testimony with more\ngeneral application grounds. We illustrate this in later sections.\nAxioms R2-4 formalize inheritance for the other deontic modals. While some deontic accounts\ntake obligation as primitive and leave the other deontic modals implicit, we maintain each and\nderive corresponding inheritance principles from OB-RM. This allows us to represent normative\ntestimony more naturally without nesting negated statements and is also central for computing\ndefeaters. We explain each of these derived inheritance principles below.\nAxiom R3 defines deontic inheritance for prohibitions. It holds that if an agent states that a\nbehavior is impermissible, then that agent believes all more specific behaviors are impermissible\nas well. Such an inference is defeated when the agent has stated a contradictory normative\ntestimony for an equal or more specific behavior along that entailment path (i.e., either between\nwhat was stated and what we are attempting to infer, or under both). Thus, one adds exceptions to\nprohibitions from below. The inheritance principle underlying this rule is defined and derived from\nOB-RM below. As a reminder, theorem OB-RM states: if \u22a2 p \u2192 q, then \u22a2 Obl(p) \u2192 Obl(q).\nCorollary 1 (Inheritance for Prohibitions). \u22a2 q \u2192 p, then \u22a2 Imp(p) \u2192 Imp(q).\nProof. As a reminder, in SDL: Obl(\u00acp) \u2261 Imp(p). Assume, q \u2192 p. By Modus Tollens (MT),\n\u00acp \u2192 \u00acq. Assume Imp(p). By definition, Obl(\u00acp). By OB-RM, Obl(\u00acq). By definition,\nImp(q). Therefore, given \u22a2 q \u2192 p, \u22a2 Imp(p) \u2192 Imp(q). \u25a1\nAxioms R2 and R4 then define inheritance for discretionary norms. Together, they hold that a\ndiscretionary norm entails that all more general behaviors are non-impermissible, and all more\nspecific behaviors are non-obligatory. This inference is broken out into the two axioms. The former\ninference (R2) is defeated when a contradictory normative testimony has been stated for an equal\nor more general behavior. So, like R1, this inference is defeated from above. The latter inference"}, {"title": "4.

Related Work", "content": "Automatically detecting and resolving norm conflicts is part of active research on normative multi-\nagent systems (NMAS) (Santos et al., 2017). For instance, Da Silva and Zahn (2014) examined\ncontextual relations and inheritance rules to evaluate potential conflicts between two norms. They\nthen defined a novel algorithm for checking for norm conflicts and rewriting the norms to resolve\nthem. However, it is quite difficult to maintain a long chain of norm edits and their dependencies\nover time. Our defeasible reasoning approach yields a much simpler norm update mechanism.\nAn approach similarly grounded in deontic logic is that of Cholvy and Cuppens (2000). Their\nlogic FUSION resolves conflicts via preference orderings amongst norms. However, they did not\nexplicitly consider conditional norms (though they do briefly discuss it for future work). We\nprovide an analysis of defeasibility considering entailments between both behaviors and contexts.\nHorty (1994) similarly explored default logic for resolving deontic conflicts. While we draw\ninspiration from Horty here, he only considered defeasibility in the context of a norm, while we\nconsider the behavior as well. Thus, our approach can detect and resolve indirect and intersecting\nconflicts. Furthermore, being more concerned with legal theory, he considered norms as an order-\nindependent set. However, here we are concerned with resolving the ever-changing normative\nbeliefs of an agent, and the order in which that agent states their norms is fundamental."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "We have presented a novel defeasible deontic calculus with inheritance (DDIC) and proven that it\nresolves norm conflicts. We have demonstrated that the resolution strategy Lex Posterior falls out\nof two norms being in contradiction under deontic inheritance. We then revealed the strategy of\nLex Specialis as a red herring. Insofar as deontic inheritance is viewed as a plausible inference,\npreference for a more specific norm merely results from deontic inheritance without conflict. These\nfindings are theoretically interesting as they result in an axiomatization for norm conflict resolution\nthat is rooted in standard deontic logic. This axiomatization, DDIC, is also practically useful, as it\nresolves norm conflicts without having to maintain edits like other approaches.\nWe plan to explore three avenues of future work. First, while we only considered conflicts\nwithin a single normative theory here, we plan to explore merging across theories, particularly\nacross diverse individuals and institutions. Second, we plan to consider speaker reliability and\nambiguity (as in Olson and Forbus, 2021) for norm conflict resolution. We have taken a speaker's\ntestimony to directly imply their belief, but of course speakers can lie, and natural language is often\nambiguous. Considering these features will allow more complex and abstract norms to be handled.\nLastly, the work here has been proof-theoretic, but we are also implementing and testing this theory\nin the Companion cognitive architecture (Forbus & Hinrichs, 2017). This system will act in\naccordance with users' norms, while users can continually update their norms via natural language."}]}

Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms struggle with locating multiple small and irregular feasible regions, making them inap-plicable to this problem. To address this issue, we here develop a multi-task evolutionary algorithm framework that incorporates the dispatch-correlated domain knowledge to effectively deal with strong constraints and multi-objective optimization. Possible evolutionary multi-task construction strategy based on complex constraint relationship analysis and handling, i.e., constraint-coupled spatial decomposition, constraint strength classification and constraint handling technique, is first explored. Within the multi-task evolutionary optimization framework, two strategies, i.e., an elite-guided knowledge transfer by designing a special crowding distance mechanism to select dominant individuals from each task, and an adaptive neighborhood technology-based mutation to effectively balance the diversity and convergence of each optimized task for the differential evolution algorithm, are further developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm in feasibility, convergence, and diversity is demonstrated in a case study of a coal mine integrated energy system by comparing with CPLEX solver and seven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "WITH the rapid development in economic and social spheres, issues like fossil energy crisis, ecological deterioration, and global warming have gained increasing prominence. Given this context, there is an urgent need to revolutionize the production and consumption of energy. Integrated energy systems (IES) have emerged as a novel, sus-tainable, and eco-friendly approach to energy supply, garnering significant interest and successful application in various light industry fields such as communities, islands, and ships [1], [2]. However, in light of the proposed two-carbon target, scholars have shifted their focus towards integrated energy systems for high-energy-consuming and high-emission industries. Among these sectors, the coal mining industry has captured substantial attention from both academia and industry. While some studies have initiated relevant research on coal mine integrated energy systems (CMIES), these achievements are still in their nascent stages [3].\nIn contrast to those conventional IES, the coal mine inte-grated energy system exhibits distinctive characteristics. First, the coal mining process generates a significant amount of associated energy in the form of rich heat, including air heat, ventilation air methane, mine water, and geothermal energy. Second, through the use of specific equipment such as air source heat pumps, ventilation air methane oxidation devices, water source heat pumps, and ground source heat pumps, the thermal energy from these sources can be harnessed to meet the production and living requirements in mining areas. \nDispatch optimization has become a focal research in inte-grated energy systems, holding great significance for system safety, economy, and environmental protection. Studies have developed various dispatch models under different scenarios, primarily categorized as single-objective dispatch models [4]- [6] and multi-objective ones [7]\u2013[9]. Single-objective dispatch models typically use commercial optimization solvers such as GUROBI or CPLEX. However, when dealing with mul-tiple optimization objectives, commercial solvers often fail to provide diverse dispatch solutions in a single run. In recent years, population-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), have been tried to solve multi-objective dispatch problems due to their outstanding performance in obtaining a set of non-dominated solutions with guaranteed convergence, diversity and distribution. Wu et al. [10] applied the NSGA-II to solve a multi-objective dispatch model for a non-linear and non-convex park-level integrated energy system. Li et al.

Analysis of dispatch results", "content": "In this section, the left endpoint of PF obtained by MMDE-\nEKT-ANM is selected as a representative dispatch scenario,\nand an energy analysis is conducted to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the obtained results in practical applications.\nThe dispatch results for cooling, thermal, and electrical are\nillustrated in Figures 12-14. (1) Figure 12 reveals that during\nthe periods of 1-6h and 23-24h, the cooling load is exclusively\nsupplied by electrical chiller, benefiting from lower electricity\nprices. However, in the periods of 7-22h, the cooling load\nis entirely met by absorption chiller due to higher electricity\nprices. (2) From Figure 13, throughout the dispatch period,\nthe output power of the ventilation air methane oxidation\ndevices is higher than that of the other three associated energy\ndevices. This is primarily due to the fact that considering\nenvironmental pollution, the penalty coefficient of abandoned"}, {"title": "JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES", "content": "ventilation air methane is higher than that of the other three\nassociated energy sources. Consequently, the ventilation air\nmethane is prioritized for consumption to reduce the aban-\ndoned energy cost. During the 7-22h, the absorption chiller\nconsumes thermal power, increasing the thermal demand. To\nmaintain thermal power balance, the increased thermal demand\nleads to an increase in the output power of the associated\nenergy devices and the gas turbine. (3) Figure 14 shows that\nduring the 1-5h and 23-24h, which are characterized by low\nelectricity demand, the electricity is primarily supplied by the\npower grid and the gas turbine. During the 6-7h and 20-22h, as\nelectricity prices increase, the output power of the power grid\ndecreases, and wind power begins to participate in the system\ndispatch. During the 8-19h, because the operating costs of the\ngas turbine and photovoltaic are relatively low, they are given\npriority for electricity generation, with the power grid and\nwind power serving as supplementary sources. In summary,\nthe energy input/output of each device in this scenario satisfies\nthe constraints of supply and demand balance and accords with\nthe actual operation demand, thus verifying the feasibility of\nthe results obtained by MMDE-EKT-ANM."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "A domain knowledge-driven multi-task multi-constraint dispatch of coal mine integrated energy system with great\nevolutionary algorithm is presented to effectively solve the number of optimized variables and strongly coupled con-\nstraints. From the viewpoint of domain-adaptive task con-\nstruction, three modes are conveyed by deeply analyzing\nthe constraint relationships. Under the constructed multi-task\noptimization framework, an enhanced differential evolution\nalgorithm articulated with elite-guided knowledge transfer\nstrategy and adaptive neighborhood mutation technique is\ndeveloped. The algorithm is applied to a practical coal mine\nintegrated energy system, and its performance in obtaining\nresults with outstanding convergence, diversity, stability and\nfeasibility is sufficiently demonstrated by comparing with\nCPLEX and seven state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective\nalgorithms.\nCompared to the CPLEX solver, our algorithm is time\nconsuming. Besides, the proposed algorithm may encounter\nscalability challenges when solving operational optimization\nproblems in uncertain scenarios. These problems will be\nfurther studied in the future."}]}

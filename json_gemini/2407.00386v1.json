Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms struggle with locating multiple small and irregular feasible regions, making them inapplicable to this problem. To address this issue, we here develop a multi-task evolutionary algorithm framework that incorporates the dispatch-correlated domain knowledge to effectively deal with strong constraints and multi-objective optimization. Possible evolutionary multi-task construction strategy based on complex constraint relationship analysis and handling, i.e., constraint-coupled spatial decomposition, constraint strength classification and constraint handling technique, is first explored. Within the multi-task evolutionary optimization framework, two strategies, i.e., an elite-guided knowledge transfer by designing a special crowding distance mechanism to select dominant individuals from each task, and an adaptive neighborhood technology-based mutation to effectively balance the diversity and convergence of each optimized task for the differential evolution algorithm, are further developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm in feasibility, convergence, and diversity is demonstrated in a case study of a coal mine integrated energy system by comparing with CPLEX solver and seven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid development in economic and social spheres, issues like fossil energy crisis, ecological deterioration, and global warming have gained increasing prominence. Given this context, there is an urgent need to revolutionize the production and consumption of energy. Integrated energy systems (IES) have emerged as a novel, sustainable, and eco-friendly approach to energy supply, garnering significant interest and successful application in various light industry fields such as communities, islands, and ships [1], [2]. However, in light of the proposed two-carbon target, scholars have shifted their focus towards integrated energy systems for high-energy-consuming and high-emission industries. Among these sectors, the coal mining industry has captured substantial attention from both academia and industry. While some studies have initiated relevant research on coal mine integrated energy systems (CMIES), these achievements are still in their nascent stages [3].\nIn contrast to those conventional IES, the coal mine integrated energy system exhibits distinctive characteristics. First, the coal mining process generates a significant amount of associated energy in the form of rich heat, including air heat, ventilation air methane, mine water, and geothermal energy. Second, through the use of specific equipment such as air source heat pumps, ventilation air methane oxidation devices, water source heat pumps, and ground source heat pumps, the thermal energy from these sources can be harnessed to meet the production and living requirements in mining areas. Dispatch optimization has become a focal research in integrated energy systems, holding great significance for system safety, economy, and environmental protection. Studies have developed various dispatch models under different scenarios, primarily categorized as single-objective dispatch models [4]\u2013[6] and multi-objective ones [7]\u2013[9]. Single-objective dispatch models typically use commercial optimization solvers such as GUROBI or CPLEX. However, when dealing with multiple optimization objectives, commercial solvers often fail to provide diverse dispatch solutions in a single run. In recent years, population-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs), such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), have been tried to solve multi-objective dispatch problems due to their outstanding performance in obtaining a set of non-dominated solutions with guaranteed convergence, diversity and distribution. Wu et al. [10] applied the NSGA-II to solve a multi-objective dispatch model for a non-linear and non-convex park-level integrated energy system. Li et al. [11] designed a preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm for an island-level integrated energy system. Wu et al. [12] proposed an improved multi-task multi-factor evolutionary algorithm for solving multi-objective dispatch problems in different integrated energy systems. Various approaches have further been developed to handle constraints in multi-objective dispatch optimization. Dong et al. [13] developed a displacement-based penalty function combined with a state transition algorithm to avoid local optima. Wu et al. [14] proposed an improved constraint dominance principle combined with NSGA-II to rapidly reduce constraint violations and effectively identify the feasible region. Wang et al. [15] proposed a dynamic epsilon constraint handling approach combined with NSGA-II to effectively locate the feasible region. In summary, EAs have demonstrated attractive performance in solving the aforementioned multi-objective dispatch problems of various integrated energy systems.\nDue to the advantage of EAs in solving the dispatch optimization problem of integrated energy systems, some scholars have attempted to employ EAs to address the dispatch optimization problem of the coal mine integrated energy system. For instance, Hu et al. [3] proposed an enhanced NSGA-II algorithm based on timing relationships to efficiently obtain a set of solutions for multi-objective dispatch. This approach reduced the dimensionality of the problem and simplified constraint complexity by dividing the dispatch period. However, this division is highly subjective. Wang et al. [16] developed an autonomous intelligent optimization strategy based on support vector machines and designed three strategies to repair infeasible solutions, thereby improving the convergence of the population under strong constraints. Nevertheless, the proposed method entailed high computational complexity. In our previous work [17], we developed an evolutionary multi-task (EMT) [18] based method to effectively solve the dispatch problem of the coal mine integrated energy system with low-dimensional multi-objective by designing an auxiliary task together with the dispatch one. Even EAs-based methods have been applied to optimize the dispatch of coal mine integrated energy system, competitive solutions are still very hard to be obtained, especially when the dispatch scenario is complex.\nTaking inspiration from the successful application of our EMT-based method [17] in solving low-dimensional cases, we here further design a powerful EMT to solve the high-dimensional multi-objective dispatch of the coal mine integrated energy system. To this end, two issues must be focused, one is the task construction to effectively deal with a large number of strong constraints associated with multi-energy coupling, and the other is efficient information sharing strategy for effectively optimizing the multiple tasks in high-dimensional space.\nAccordingly, the following three contents will be addressed when exploiting the EMT-based method to solve the high-dimensional dispatch optimization of the coal mine integrated energy system. 1) Constructing a domain-adaptive multi-task based dispatch for the coal mine integrated energy system by deeply analyzing the complex constraints relationships under the complex energy coupling knowledge. 2) Designing a knowledge transfer strategy to enhance problem-solving efficiency and minimize transfer time consumption. 3) Improving EA operators to enhance the evolving performance for high dimensional optimization.\nThe main contributions of our algorithm are as follows:\n\u2022 Developed a domain-adaptive multi-task evolutionary dispatch framework by incorporating the constraint knowledge for the coal mine integrated energy system. Under this framework, three multi-task construction modes based on complex constraint relationship analysis are demonstrated. It includes constraint-coupled variable space decomposition, constraint strength categorization, and constraint handling techniques.\n\u2022 Designed an elite-guided knowledge transfer strategy based on special crowding distance (EKT-SCD). For each task, the individuals within the same pareto front are ranked using a special crowding distance and only the top 20% of elite individuals from each pareto front are selected for knowledge transfer. This strategy balances diversity in both objective and decision spaces while reducing the cost of knowledge transfer.\n\u2022 Proposed a multi-task multi-constraint differential evolution algorithm with elite-guided knowledge transfer and adaptive neighborhood mutation (MMDE-EKT-ANM). The mutation mechanism uses an angle-based neighborhood technique in the DE/rand/1 strategy to enhance the ability of differential evolution to escape locally feasible regions in high-dimensional space with strong constraints.\nThe rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section II introduces the multi-objective dispatch optimization model of the coal mine integrated energy system. Section III develops a multi-task multi-constraint algorithm framework for the dispatch problem. The designed multi-task multi-constrain differential evolution algorithm with elite-guided knowledge transfer and adaptive neighborhood mutation is stated in Section IV. Section V carries out the experimental results and analysis. The conclusions and future work are outlined in Section VI."}, {"title": "II.

Model analysis", "content": "Based on the aforementioned model, a mathematical analysis can be conducted to explore the underlying challenges in achieving a set of non-dominated solutions with multi-objective evolutionary optimization. To provide a general analysis, the symbol $m$ is used to represent the number of associated energy types, and the symbol $n$ represents the number of devices. The dimension of decision space is $D =n \\times 24$, and the number of constraints $E = 2 \\times (n - 2) \\times 24$. In addition, as the number of $m$ increases, the constraints also increase by $2 \\times m \\times 24$. For example, if we here consider $m = 4$ and $n = 18$, resulting in an optimized variable with dimension as $D = 18 \\times 24 = 432$ and constraints number as $E = 32 \\times 24 = 768$. Apparently, such a constraint scale is quite difficult for traditional EAs. In summary, compared to the typical integrated energy system, the coal mine one involves a larger number of associated energy types ($m$) and devices ($n$), leading to a significant increase in the scale of the optimization problem and the number of constraints, as well as a stronger coupling among the constraints. These factors collectively contribute to the immense challenge of finding feasible solutions."}, {"title": "III. MULTI-TASK MULTI-CONSTRAINT EVOLUTIONARY DISPATCH FRAMEWORK", "content": "The proposed multi-task based evolutionary framework is shown in Figure 2. It comprises four main modules: dispatch model input, multi-task construction, multi-task optimization, and result output. Among these, the multi-task construction and multi-task optimization modules are concerned here. For the multi-task construction, strong constraints are essentially managed by analyzing the implicit domain knowledge. Three kinds of constraint relationship analysis will be demonstrated as examples. For the multi-task optimization, an enhanced differential evolution with elite individuals-based knowledge transfer and improved mutation is developed. Clearly, the domain-adaptive task construction is the base of our algorithm, and three alternative methods will be explained in this section. And the specific evolutionary algorithm will be discussed in the following section."}, {"title": "A. Constructed task with constraint-coupled variable space decomposition", "content": "The constraints of our dispatch are usually strongly coupled due to the multiple energy coupling relationships. However, the coupling relation may often exist among a subset of the energy sources or transformations. According to the physical logic of our problem, we can first recognize the coupling relationships among the optimized variables and then decompose the space into several subspaces. Then multiple tasks with weak and low dimensional constraints can be obtained. Figure 3 provides an example of a multi-task construction with constraint-coupled variable space decomposition. As shown in the figure, according to the coupling relationship between electrical, cooling, and thermal variables under equality constraints, the variable space is decomposed into three low-dimensional subspaces, namely, electrical-thermal subspace, electrical-cooling subspace, and thermal-cooling subspace. Subsequently, these three different subspaces form three different optimization tasks."}, {"title": "B. Constructed task with constraint strength classification", "content": "The strength of each constraint is different in the dispatch of an integrated energy system, for example, the strength of supply and demand balance constraints is larger than that of climbing constraints and other constraints. Therefore, it is logical to classify constraints according to their strength, and then construct multiple optimization tasks with lower intensity. Figure 4 illustrates an example of constructing multiple tasks based on constraint strength classification. In this example, four tasks are created by combining constraints of different strength levels. Task 1 includes all constraints, Task 2 comprises the electrical balance constraint and partial inequality constraints, Task 3 encompasses the thermal balance constraint and partial inequality constraints, and Task 4 includes the cooling balance constraint and partial inequality constraints. The above task construction method shows that the difficulty of constraint handling can be effectively reduced by assigning the three highest-strength equality constraints to different auxiliary tasks, thus promoting the solution of the problem."}, {"title": "C. Constructed task based on different constraint handling techniques", "content": "In recent years, various constraint handling techniques (CHTs) have been developed to effectively solve constraints, and the representative ones are the penalty function method [19], constraint domination principle (CDP) [20], epsilon constraint relaxation method [21] and hybrid method [22]. In essence, these methods exhibit different preferences towards constraints, so that different constraint search spaces can be formed. Motivated by this, we propose the construction of multi-tasks by fusing constraint spaces using different CHTS. Figure 5 illustrates an example of multi-task construction based on different CHTs, where two optimization tasks are designed according to different CHTs. Task 1 involves the fusion of constraint spaces using a hybrid of CDP and improved epsilon method [23], while Task 2 achieves fusion using the improved epsilon method alone. By employing different CHTS for constraint space fusion, these tasks create different search spaces that help explore multiple different feasible domains.\nIn summary, driven by domain knowledge, we are given three modes to construct multi-tasks based on constraint relationship analysis. These task construction modes may be adapted to different scenario, and the CHTs based method will be adopted in the following from the aspect of performing the multi-task optimization with fewer tasks."}, {"title": "IV.

First, the individuals in the same front are sorted by calculating the crowding distance of the individuals, and then the top 20% individuals from each front are selected as elite individuals for knowledge transfer."}, {"title": "C. Differential evolution based on adaptive neighborhood mutation", "content": "Differential evolution (DE) [25] is a simple yet powerful EA that has been successfully applied to many optimization problems [26], [27]. In particular, DE has shown promise in dispatch optimization for integrated energy systems. Based on this, we choose the DE as the optimizer to implement the task optimization. However, due to the high-dimensional and multi-constraint nature of the dispatch optimization of the coal mine integrated energy system, the optimization performance of the DE is degraded. To address this, we embed a neighborhood technique [28] with enhanced diversity into DE and propose an adaptive neighborhood mutation mechanism to improve DE performance. Specifically, an angle-based neighborhood strategy [27] is first used to construct $N_r$ neighborhoods ($N_r$ set to 10) for each individual. Then, within the constructed neighborhoods, the DE/rand/1 strategy [29] is combined to further enhance the diversity of local search, helping DE to escape local feasible domains. Moreover, the DE/current-to-best/1 strategy [29] is applied to the entire population to enhance global search convergence and feasibility. To achieve a balance among diversity, convergence, and feasibility, an adaptive mechanism is designed. The ANM mechanism is described as follows:\n$$V_i = \\begin{cases}  X_i + F_i(X_{r1'} - x_{r2'}), & \\text{if rand}_i < P_c \\\\ X_i + F_i(X_{best} - X_i) + F_i(x_{r1} - x_{r2}), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere randi returns a random number ranging from 0 to 1; r1', r2' are two individuals randomly selected from the neighborhood formed by xi and r1' \u2260 r2'; r1, r2 are two individuals randomly selected from the current population and r1 \u2260 r2; xbest is the best individual; F={0.6,0.8,1.0} is randomly chosen from three different values, which have been widely used in previous literature due to their contributions to diversity and maintaining good search capability [23]; Pc is a probability parameter Pc = 1 \u2013 G/Gmax.\nDiscuss: The inherent advantages of the ANM mechanism are further analyzed in conjunction with the tasks constructed in Section III-C. (1) By combining the neighborhood and DE/rand/1 strategies, the diversity of local search can be enhanced, prompting Task 1 to locate multiple discrete feasible regions, while Task 2 can thoroughly explore local infeasible regions. (2) The DE/current-to-best/1 strategy enables global search to increase feasibility and convergence speed. In this case, Task 1 can approach excellent individuals, thereby improving population distribution. Task 2 can accelerate the search to discover more promising regions. (3) The adaptive strategy maintains a good balance between diversity, feasibility, and convergence. In the early stages of evolution, most individuals adopt the DE/rand/1 strategy, thereby enhancing the exploration capability and diversity of the population. In the later stages of evolution, as the individuals in the current population have converged near the pareto optimal solutions, they gradually tend to choose the DE/current-to-best/1 strategy to improve search efficiency and accuracy. In summary, the ANM mechanism can locate multiple feasible regions and avoid premature convergence, allowing DE to achieve higher search efficiency."}, {"title": "V.

Group 1: the most often used CPLEX solver is compared by transforming the multi-objective dispatch problems into single-objective one through linear weighting. To ensure fairness, the CPLEX solver performs iterations with N sets of different weights varied in the range [0, 1]. Here, N corresponds to the population size of our algorithm. Group 2: seven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs), i.e., co-evolutionary CMOEA (CCMO) [31], dual-population based evolutionary algorithm (c-DPEA) [32], EMT-based constraint multi-objective optimization algorithm (EMCMO) [33], improved EMCMO algorithm (CMOEMT) [34], double-balanced EMT algorithm (DBEMTO) [35], dynamic auxiliary task-based on EMT algorithm (MTCMO) [23], and improved MTCMO algorithm (IMTCMO) [36], are compared.

The IGD focuses on measuring the proximity between the obtained PF and the optimal PF, reflecting the convergence of the algorithm. A smaller IGD value indicates better convergence. The HV is a comprehensive evaluation indicator that simultaneously assesses the convergence and diversity of the algorithm. A larger HV value indicates better performance in convergence and diversity. It is worth noting that all algorithms share the same reference set for the IGD and HV indicators."}, {"title": "C.

As can be seen from the figure, although our algorithm is slightly less diverse than the CPLEX solver, it has superior convergence.\nNumerical analysis is further compared by selecting two endpoints from Figure 9, and the results are presented in Table II. For the left endpoint, result of our algorithm clearly outperforms the CPLEX in both reducing the operation cost (save 41.44 rmb) and the abandoned energy cost (save 419.43 rmb). For the right endpoint, the solutions obtained by both methods are non-dominated. Compared to the solution of the CPLEX solver, although the operation cost of our method increases 137.51 rmb, it effectively reduces the cost of abandoned energy cost by 34.76 rmb, thus helping to reduce carbon emissions. Besides, the runtime of these two algorithms is also compared, the running time of our algorithm is about twice that of the CPLEX solver and it is acceptable. In conclusion, although our algorithm exhibits a slight compromise in terms of runtime and diversity, it outperforms the CPLEX solver in convergence and energy utilization.

The \"Best\" showcases the optimal results achieved after 20 runs, while the \u201cWorst\" presents the corresponding worst values. Optimal results for the IGD and HV indicators are denoted in bold, and suboptimal results are underlined.\nThe following conclusions can be observed from Table III: (1) The proposed MMDE-EKT-ANM achieves the optimal Mean value as 17.6654 for the IGD indicator, 123.0492 less than that of the second-ranked CMOEMT algorithm, indicating a prominent convergence.

It attains 11% of the second-ranked algorithm IMTCMO for the Best value and 17% of the second-ranked algorithm MTCMO for the Worst value. In summary, the results strongly indicate that the MMDE-EKT-ANM algorithm significantly surpasses the other compared algorithms in terms of convergence and stability.\nTable IV lists the HV results among eight different algorithms. (1) Analysis of Table IV reveals that MMDE-EKT-ANM consistently achieves better HV values compared to other compared algorithms. CMOEMT, IMTCMO, and MTCMO secure second-ranked results in Mean, Worst, and Best values, respectively, at only 81%, 78%, and 89% of the proposed algorithm.

In conclusion, MMDE-EKT-ANM effectively addresses dispatch optimization for the coal mine integrated energy system, outperforming other evolutionary algorithms and delivering superior performance in terms of diversity, convergence, and stability.\nTo visually demonstrate the distribution of feasible solution sets obtained by all algorithms, we plot the PF comparison chart as shown in Figure 10. The figure demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms other compared algorithms in terms of diversity and convergence, which is consistent with the evaluation results of the IGD and HV indicators recorded in Table III and Table IV."}, {"title": "D. Validation of the proposed strategy\u2019s effectiveness", "content": "To validate the effectiveness of the adaptive neighborhood mutation and elite-guided knowledge transfer strategies in the MMDE-EKT-ANM algorithm, we design two variant algorithms, namely MMDE-EKT and MMDE-ANM. In the MMDE-EKT variant, the neighborhood strategy is removed, while in the MMDE-ANM variant, individual selection based on special crowding distance is replaced with random individual selection. Subsequently, the IGD and HV indicators are employed to compare the performance of the two variant algorithms against the MMDE-EKT-ANM algorithm. The comparison results are presented in Table V. And the visualized results are demonstrated in Figure 11. From Table V it can be also concluded that MMDE-EKT-ANM achieves the most favorable outcomes in terms of the Mean, Std, Worst, and Best values of the IGD and HV indicators, indicating its superiority in terms of convergence, diversity, and stability.

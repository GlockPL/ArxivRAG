INTRODUCTION", "content": "WITH the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), many kinds of wireless sensing signals (e.g., Wi-Fi, Infrared images, visible images, Radio Frequency (RF) signal) are filling our living and working spaces nowadays. Recently, researchers have also utilized RF signals to capture events in the IoT environment (i.e., RF sensing). While RF signals are transmitted, reflected, blocked, and scattered by objects like walls, furniture, vehicles, and human bodies, it is possible to extract useful information, such as position, movement direction, speed, and vital signs of a human subject, from received RF signals. Unlike traditional hardware sensors, RF sensing provides users with low-cost and unobtrusive services. Furthermore, due to the broadcast nature of RF signals, RF sensing can be used not only to monitor multiple subjects, but also to capture changes in the environment over a large area [1].\nTraditional RF sensing methods face several limitations in IoT systems, including noise and interference, which degrade signal quality and lead to inaccurate data interpretation. The presence of other electronic devices and RF sources causes further data loss or corruption. Incomplete data is common in scenarios with limited sensor deployment, and the high costs of deploying and maintaining extensive sensor networks make large-scale implementations expensive. Additionally, unstable environments cause signal weakening and multipath propagation, reducing reliability. These challenges necessitate advanced solutions like Generative AI (GenAI) to enhance the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of IoT systems.\nGenAI refer to neural network models designed to generate new data similar to a given dataset, including Generative Ad-versarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Autoregressive Models, flow-Based Models, Diffusion Mod-els (DMs), and Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). These techniques offer significant advantages in data-intensive applications by creating high-quality synthetic data, improving data quality through denoising, and filling in missing values. Generative AI is particularly effective in both cross-modal and multi-modal applications: integrating diverse data types into unified representations for better decision-making and translating information between modalities to enhance robustness. This capability supports innovative IoT applications, smart cities, healthcare, and autonomous systems, showcasing generative AI's transformative potential.\nGenAI's ability to enhance data quality and integrate various data types makes it ideal for IoT applications, which require universality. With the advent of smarter devices, advanced sensors, and enhanced connectivity technologies like 5G and 6G, IoT systems can greatly benefit from GenAI. It extends conventional deep learning to manage diverse and unforeseen tasks with limited data and resources. GenAI's generalization capability is crucial for IoT devices to adapt to new envi-ronments and tasks. Additionally, GenAI's natural language processing enhances multi-modal sensing by integrating text, audio, and visual data, creating more comprehensive and intelligent IoT systems.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, we discuss the main challenges in RF sensing applications and explore how GenAI can address these issues using unimodal and multi-modal datasets, including reviewing the most relevant works and proposing feasible so-lutions for the potential use of GenAI. The main contributions of this article can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWe provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art GenAI techniques in RF sensing, covering both uni-modal and multi-modal challenges.

A SHORT REVIEW OF GENAI TECHNIQUES", "content": "In this section, a short review of GenAI and their potential in RF sensing applications are provided (see Table I). GenAI is defined as Al models which are capable of generating new contents, data, or information from the learned distribution of the trained data. We provide a brief introduction to popular GenAI models and review their application to RF sensing, respectively.\nGANs [2] generally consist of two neural networks inter-acting in the form of a zero-sum game, in which the generator \\(G\\) aims to generate new data with the same statistics as the training dataset while the discriminator \\(D\\) focuses on the identification of the true and fake data samples. In RF sensing applications, GANs offer the potential to generate realistic synthetic RF data, enhance signal quality, and enable robust anomaly detection. Their ability to model complex signal environments and facilitate data augmentation paves the way for more resilient and adaptive RF sensing systems.\nVAEs learn an encoder and a decoder to embed data into a continuous latent space, where the decoder uses a parameterized likelihood function [3]. This approach reduces overfitting, making VAEs ideal for large datasets like radio map construction. In RF sensing, VAEs significantly enhance performance by denoising data and reconstructing incomplete RF signals, VAEs filter out noise and infer missing parts, creating comprehensive datasets even with partial sensor coverage or data loss. These capabilities make RF sensing systems more robust, adaptable, and effective, improving their performance and reliability in various IoT applications.\nDMs use a Markov chain to add random noise to data (forward diffusion) and then denoise it to generate desired samples (reverse diffusion) [4]. The forward process trans-forms the data distribution into a simple prior (e.g., Gaussian noise), and new data is generated by denoising samples from this prior. Diffusion models enhance RF sensing in IoT by iteratively generating and denoising data, producing high-quality synthetic RF data and improving signal clarity. They effectively detect anomalies and capture fine variations in RF environments, and robustly reconstruct incomplete RF data, ensuring comprehensive datasets despite partial sensor coverage. These capabilities improve the precision, reliability, and robustness of RF sensing in IoT applications.\nLLMs [5] are pre-trained on massive text datasets to learn contextual dependencies, and have achieved remarkable success in various applications, including question answering, language comprehension, reading comprehension, code cre-ation, and both mathematical and common sense reasoning. In IoT systems, LLMs enhance RF sensing by incorporating natural language processing, enabling sensors to interpret and generate human language for smarter device communication. By involving the natural language modality, LLMs facilitate sophisticated multi-modal data analysis, combining RF data with textual and audio inputs for comprehensive insights. This capability improves anomaly detection, contextual understand-"}, {"title": "III. GENAI EMPOWERED UNI-MODAL WIRELESS SENSING IN IOT", "content": "The field of RF sensing involves utilizing radio frequency signals to detect and interpret physical phenomena, offering critical capabilities for applications such as environmental monitoring, health diagnostics, and security systems. Both traditional and modern RF sensing techniques face inher-ent challenges during the data acquisition and transmission stages. Among these challenges, high costs for data col-lection, significant interference during data acquisition, and bandwidth limitations for the data transmission are particularly prominent. Additionally, although RF signals are considered crucial information source in many IoT applications, they are extremely sparse due to the difficulty and high costs associated with setting up extensive observation points. To address these issues, we explore the emerging application of GenAI techniques to uni-modality RF sensing, building on their success in the computer vision domain, and provide visions for future directions.\nMoreover, despite the advantages of using RF signals in IoT systems, challenges arise due to the rapid increase in IoT devices, which complicates efficient signal acquisition and data collection. Precise synchronization, robust interference han-dling, and managing large data volumes are particularly chal-lenging. Consequently, RF signals often suffer from missed observations and exhibit a sparse structure, creating obstacles for effective downstream tasks. Generative AI addresses these challenges by using models like GANs, VAEs, and DMs to reconstruct missing data, infer information for localization, and generate representative samples for downstream tasks (see Fig. 2). The advantages of GenAI in the unimodal case can be discussed in three main aspects.\nA. Data imputation\nA specific issue within RF sensing is the handling of missing Received Signal Strength (RSS) readings, which can lead to low accuracy and reliability in various applications, such as localization and environment monitoring. In these cases, the missing data needs to be filled in based on the observed data to minimize the impact. In the context of filling missing data, the correlation between the missing data and observed data is crucial. However, this correlation varies and traditional neural networks face challenges in handling this variability, as they often assume fixed spatial relationships or rely on predefined spatial structures. To address this issue, GenAI models, such as Transformers, have a great potential in learning complex dependencies and varying impacts of different observations, in which attention mechanisms can explicitly model the varying impact of each observation. Additionally, GenAI can create embeddings that capture broader context and relationships within the data, which can generate more accurate missing data. For instance, Wang et al. [6] leverages the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, known for its strong representation learning ability and gen-eralization capability in natural language processing, to input collected RSS data and predict missing signals in the radio map. In the case of RF sensing, BERT can be adapted to understand the contextual relationships within RSS data, much like it understands word relationships in a sentence. This capability allows BERT to model complex dependencies and patterns in the RSS data, making it highly effective at inferring missing values. By accurately predicting these missing signals, BERT helps to reduce the workload of collecting RSS in the offline phase and provides accurate positioning results in the online phase. This ultimately improves the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of radio map construction.\nB. Super-resolution\nWhile these advancements are promising, there are still significant challenges to address in RF sensing. In particular, in many IoT deployments, the number of sensors is limited due to cost constraints, power requirements, or physical space limitations. This can result in large areas with minimal sensor coverage, leading to extremely sparse data. When there are"}, {"title": "IV. GENAI EMPOWERED MULTI-MODALITY RF SENSING IN IOT", "content": "In this section, we introduce the multi-modality RF sensing techniques in two parts, namely cross-modality RF sensing and multi-modality fusion for RF sensing (see Fig. 3). This division is motivated by the capabilities of GenAI to enhance RF sensing performance through distinct approaches. Cross-modality RF sensing leverages GenAI to correlate RF signals with another modality, such as images, to mitigate challenges like sparsity, interference and missing data. Meanwhile, multi-modality fusion combines data from multiple modalities using GenAI to create a comprehensive representation, overcoming the limitations of individual modalities and improving overall sensing performance.\nTo better highlight the potential of GenAI in each category of techniques, we provide the following definitions:\nDefinition 1: Cross-Modality RF sensing focuses on learn-ing and utilizing the relationships between different modalities to infer one modality from another. It aims to handle scenar-ios where one modality may be missing or incomplete, by leveraging information from another modality.\nDefinition 2: Multi-modality fusion for RF sensing in-volves the simultaneous integration of multiple data modalities (e.g., visible images, LiDAR, audios), with RF signals, to create a unified representation that leverages the strengths of each modality and improve overall sensing accuracy and effectiveness. In this approach, it is assumed that multiple modalities are available, and it focuses on combining them to improve performance.\nA. Cross-modal RF sensing with GenAI\nIn RF sensing scenarios, during the training phase, models may be trained using simulated RF data or data collected under controlled conditions where signals are easy to observe and interference are controlled. However, in real-world deploy-ment, the actual RF signals might be sparse, noisy, or even unavailable due to environmental constraints or hardware limi-tations. GenAI-empowered cross-modal RF sensing techniques address the problems in various methodologies.\nLLMs provide great potential for cross-modal learning with their strong capacity to enhance the generalizability of multimodal systems. A first strategy is to train universal models on vast datasets across numerous modalities, to encode these modalities into embeddings. More specifically, multi-modal LLMs can help to generate embeddings that effectively represent the underlying information from different modalities, therefor helping to enhance the generalizability of the universal models. The second direction, From a more precise perspective"}, {"title": "V. A FOUNDATION MODEL FOR RF SENSING AND COMMUNICATION", "content": "While we have discussed the potential of GenAI models to enhance wireless sensing, an additional research question arises: can we pretrain a foundation GenAI model on sensory data that can be used for different sensing tasks and scenarios? Inspired by the Meta-Transformer [12], a task-agnostic model trained for generating visual data, e.g., 3D environment image, can be used for computer vision tasks such as ob-ject detection, visualization and tracking. Similarly, a model trained for generating RF signals, e.g., 4D radio map, can support various wireless communication tasks, such as beam selection, mobility and spectrum management (Fig. 5), via task-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, cross-modality encoders can be trained to encode the raw data on a common latent space. This can be achieved by contrastive learning, following the CLIP [14] method to maximize cross-modality similarity between environment image and RF signal. Thereafter, a unified GenAI model is trained on the data embedding to generate the visual or radio environment representation, which can be realized by AR or DM trained on self-supervised learning (i.e. masked or next image/RF token prediction). Finally, the generated visual or RF embedding can be used by a multi-modal LLM to perform multiple downstream tasks in wireless sensing and communications. For example, a visual language model such as [15] can produce location of a targeted user from the constructed environment image, to complete the localization task. Similarly, a RF-language model can generate policies of optimal beams for tracking a user, to perform the beam management task. After pre-training on large wireless sensing datasets, we anticipate LLMs with embedded visual and radio data can perform multiple tasks in sensing and communications based on the user's prompts. In doing so, we can build a unified model framework for sensing which does not require task specific retraining or fine-tuning, as shown by Fig. 5."}, {"title": "VI. CHALLENGES", "content": "In this section, we elaborate on several challenges of using generative AI encountered in RF sensing applications within IoT systems.\nA. Prior information combination\nOne critical challenge lies in the effective utilization of prior information to enhance the accuracy of generated samples from sparse observations. In RF sensing, additional prior information, such as spatial configurations, historical signal patterns, and environmental characteristics, is often available and can significantly improve reconstruction accuracy by pro-viding context and reducing ambiguity in the generated data. To leverage this, it is essential to integrate the prior information seamlessly with the architecture design in generative models, such as GANs or diffusion models, possibly by conditioning the generative model based on the prior information.\nB. Distortion-perception tradeoff\nGenAI techniques are highly effective in tasks requiring human or machine perception but encounter challenges when distortion is more critical, such as in radio map reconstruction. Therefore one challenge is to develop models that optimize both distortion and perception. One possible way to address this challenge is to integrate traditional neural networks, trained to minimize distortion, with GenAI models when deal-ing with problems that involve both distortion and perception.\nC. Implementation of large models\nAnother challenge is the storage and computing of large GenAI models, particularly LLMs. These models enable intel-ligent edges in IoT systems but present storage and computing"}, {"title": "VII.

These predictions are based on the user's past behavior, preferences, or the behavior of similar users [1]. The main goal of any RS is to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and facilitate decision-making processes [2]. This is applicable across various domains, including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media. RS hold significant roles in both theoretical research (academics) and practical applications (industry).\nThe importance of RS has grown exponentially with the advent of big data and advancements in artificial intelligence [3, 4].

The primary goal of RS is to enhance user experience by personalizing content [3]. At its core, an RS combines user and item profiles with a filtering mechanism to align user preferences with suitable items [13]. User profiles gather data such as demographics and browsing history, while item profiles detail features like genres. Both explicit feedback (e.g. ratings) and implicit feedback (e.g. browsing actions) refine these recommendations."}, {"title": "Historical Context", "content": "One of the pioneering efforts for RS is from Elen Rich in 1979 [67] to suggest books based on user preferences categorized into \"stereotypes\". Following this, Jussi Karlgren conceptualized the \"digital bookshelf\" in 1990 [68], an idea later expanded by researchers at SICS, MIT, and Bellcore, with notable contributions from Pattie Maes, Will Hill, and Paul Resnick, whose GroupLens project [69] received the 2010 ACM Software Systems Award. Later, Adomavicius [3], Herlocker [70], and Beel [71] provided foundational theory on RS.\nTraditional RS methods can be categorized into collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches, aiming to improve user experience [13]. Collaborative filtering (CF) [70] is based on the idea that users with similar preferences will likely have similar tastes in the future. CF recommends items by finding a neighborhood of similar users or items. CF can recommend items without needing much content analysis, however, it normally faces challenges like cold starts, scalability, and sparsity [34] . Content-based filtering (CBF) [72] recommends items based on a user past preferences and item characteristics, using techniques like Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), cosine similarity, and neural networks for item representation. However, it may struggle with recommending new or unseen items. Hybrid RS [36] combine the strengths of both approaches, offering more accurate and personalized recommendations by integrating diverse methodologies."}, {"title": "Current State of Practice and Theory in Recommender Systems", "content": "Academia focuses on the theory, methods, and algorithms in RS, while the industry emphasizes practical applications, scalability, and direct business impacts. This section explores the distinct challenges faced by these two sectors.\nTheoretical Research on Recommender Systems Theoretical research on RS is commonly initiated by academics through the development of new algorithms, models, and evaluation metrics. However, academic researchers face challenges in accessing diverse and comprehensive datasets due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and financial barriers. Additionally, data quality issues such as biases, inaccuracies, and outdated information limit the development and testing of RS in varied contexts.\nThe drive for high accuracy in research models can often lead to overfitting, which makes them unusable for real-world applications. Such a focus may neglect crucial aspects like diversity, novelty, and user satisfaction. Additionally, solutions from academia are frequently not easily adaptable in industry settings due to their reliance on data-intensive algorithms, complexity, and a disconnect in keeping developers updated.\nPractices in Recommender Systems The industry faces several challenges in deploying RS, particularly concerning scalability as user bases and catalog sizes expand. Adapting to constantly evolving user preferences and content availability presents ongoing difficulties. Ensuring the diversity and fairness of recommendations is crucial to avoid biases. Additionally, integrating real-time data and maintaining high performance under heavy loads are significant challenges. Balancing personalization with privacy concerns requires careful handling of user data to build trust and comply with regulations.\nCommon Challanges Both theory and practice emphasize the importance of high-quality (accurate, relevant, reliable, and representative of the intended use case or application) datasets for building RS. Academic research often relies on high-quality data for benchmarking purposes, while the industry frequently requires such data to enhance user experience and system effectiveness.\nTheoretically, RS algorithms are quite advanced now, featuring layers of deep neural networks and the latest language model complexities. In practice, however, these models are not immediately applicable to real-world use cases. Industry sectors, generally running a set of standard models, require significant adaptations to implement these advanced algorithms effectively\nIn this survey, we examine the theoretical and practical aspects of RS, with the goal to facilitate a smooth transition from research to real-world application."}, {"title": "Literature Review Methodology", "content": "To compile a comprehensive and relevant list of papers for our review, we conducted a systematic literature review, adhering to established methodology principles [74].

What strategies can be utilized to apply theoretical advancements in RS to practical applications?\nDatabases Searched For selecting studies, we gathered articles published inclusively from January 2017 through April 2024. This timeframe was chosen because much of the evolution in RS is linked to deep learning algorithms, also highlighted in the RecSys workshop in 2017 [75]. We conducted our literature search across multiple academic databases and digital libraries renowned for their extensive collections of RS literature, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, JMLR, and Wiley.

Despite their widespread adoption, several challenges persist in their deployment and maintenance.\nE-commerce E-commerce platforms face the challenge of personalizing the shopping experience by recommending products in real-time, managing vast data, and adapting to changing consumer preferences [76]. Personalization must consider factors such as time, season, location, and the user's current situation. For example, recommendations for a new parent shopping for baby products will differ significantly from those for a book lover. Introducing diversity and novelty in recommendations is crucial to keep the experience fresh and engaging.\nEntertainment In the entertainment industry, the challenge lies in tracking users' preferences across genres while introducing them to new content to maintain engagement. Balancing personalization and novelty is essential. Music recommendations require frequent updates due to the shorter shelf life of songs compared to movies [77]. Conversely, movie recommendations are less dependent on frequent updates, as films typically have a longer shelf life. However, effective movie RS should still balance between promoting new releases and maintaining a selection of enduring favorites to satisfy a wide range of user preferences [78].\nNews The news industry must deliver personalized content promptly without overwhelming users. News preferences are highly dynamic, necessitating recommendations that adapt to rapid changes in interests and current events [59]. It is important to offer diverse viewpoints to prevent echo chambers, combat misinformation [79], and maintain user trust.\nTourism Personalized booking recommendations in tourism must account for user preferences regarding destinations, travel dates, budgets, and accommodations [80]. Integrating factors such as past travel history, seasonal trends, and real-time availability is essential. Balancing immediate needs, like dining recommendations during travel, with advance bookings for stays and major attractions enhances the overall user experience.\nHealthcare Healthcare RS face issues like data privacy, security, and patient consent under regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Providers, patients, and administrators all require access to relevant information tailored to their roles, necessitating role-based solutions and robust processing capabilities to handle large volumes of heterogeneous data effectively [81].\nFinance Financial RS need to navigate data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Challenges include managing data quality, integrating diverse data sources, and providing personalized financial advice [19]. Ensuring the interpretability and transparency of recommendations is crucial for building trust and user confidence. Fairness of the recommendations is of utmost importance.\nE-learning E-learning RS face the task of addressing varied user needs, overcoming the cold start problem with new users, and handling data sparsity. Adapting to dynamic content and user behavior, ensuring contextual relevance, scalability, and employing suitable evaluation metrics to assess educational impact are fundamental challenges [82].\nDiscussion RS across various sectors face a set of common challenges despite their industry-specific characteristics. Generally, these systems struggle with balancing personalization and user privacy, managing data scalability, and ensuring the diversity and novelty of recommendations to keep users engaged. They must also address the cold-start problem, where insufficient user data can hinder the system's ability to make accurate recommendations. Additionally, dynamic user preferences require systems to continually adapt and learn from new data, posing challenges in real-time processing and algorithmic efficiency. Lastly, ensuring fairness and avoiding bias in recommendations is crucial, as these systems often influence user decisions and can perpetuate existing disparities if not carefully managed.\nIn the following sections, we explore the evolution of RS and how they address these challenges."}, {"title": "Foundational Recommender Systems", "content": "A RS can be mathematically represented as a function f that predicts the utility of an item i for a user u, denoted as $f_{ui}$, which estimates how much user u would prefer item i.[3] . This function is typically learned from historical data:\n$r_{ui} = f(u, i; \\Theta)$  (1)\nwhere $\\Theta$ represents the parameters of the model, learned from the data. In the context of RS, the term $f_{ui}$ represents a prediction of the rating or utility that a user would assign to an item This prediction is used for recommending items that are likely to be of interest to the user. A general framework of RS is illustrated in Figure 2. The lifecycle of a data-driven model within an RS starts with data acquisition, followed by storage and preparation. This leads to feature engineering, forming the basis of the data pipeline. The data pipeline feeds into the training pipeline, which includes model training and validation. Following training, the process involves candidate generation and ranking. This process is complemented by A/B testing, offline and/or online evaluation. The final stages include deployment and monitoring.\nBelow, we present an overview of foundational RS."}, {"title": "Foundational Recommender Systems", "content": "Foundational RS refers to the early models and techniques that established the core principles and methodologies in the field of recommendation engines. These systems primarily include collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.\nContent-Based Filtering Content-based filtering (CBF) is a recommendation strategy that suggests items to a user based on the attributes of the items and a profile of the user's preferences, typically utilizing similarity measures to match user preferences with item attributes [83]. In CBF, the recommendation $f_{ui}$ is based on the features of items $\\phi(i)$ and a profile of the user's preferences $\\theta(u)$:\n$r_{ui} = \\theta(u)^T\\phi(i)$ (2)\n\u2022 $\\phi(i)$ represents the feature vector of the item.\n\u2022 $\\theta(u)$ represents the user preference vector.\nThe evolution of CBF recommendation models starts from traditional methods [83] like vector-space models, probabilistic models, and decision trees, relying on manual feature engineering and similarity calculations. Vector-space models compute item similarity through cosine similarity [84], probabilistic models estimate the likelihood of user preference with statistical analysis [85], and decision trees recommend items by categorizing them based on attributes [83]. These models laid the groundwork for personalized recommendations by leveraging explicit item features and user preferences.\nAlgorithmic advancements in computer science and ML methods led to a shift to sophisticated neural networks that allow automatic feature extraction and learning complex data patterns [86]. These neural network-based systems leverage deep learning to analyze user interactions and item features across different modalities, including textual (such as reviews [87], citations [88], and news [89]), streaming (like music [77]), and image data [90]. The overall goal of these advancements is to generate personalized recommendations by aligning user profiles with item characteristics.\nChallenges with CBF: In general, CBF faces challenges such as the cold-start problem, over-specialization (only suggesting items similar to those the user has already seen or liked), computational cost (which can increase quadratically or cubically with the number of users and items), and a lack of updates to user and item profiles.\nCollaborative Filtering Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique used by RS to predict the preferences of a user based on the preferences of similar other users [34]. CF techniques are broadly divided into two main categories: memory-based and model-based methods. Memory-based CF makes recommendations using similarities between users or items directly from user ratings. It has further two types: user-based CF predicts a user ratings based on similar users' historical ratings [70], while item-based CF predicts ratings based on similar items [91]. Both methods face"}, {"title": "Can Foundational Recommender Systems address Practical Challenges?", "content": "Foundational RS, which include CF, CBF, and hybrid methods, form the core of many personalized recommendation solutions.

In contrast, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), a type of feedforward neural network, use deep layers to model these nonlinear interactions more accurately, improving both prediction accuracy and recommendation quality. The evolution of MLPs is seen in RS such as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) [94], Deep Factorization Machine (DFM) [99], Wide & Deep [97], xDeepFM [141], Deep & Cross Network (DCN) [100], FMLP-Rec [142], a model with learnable filters for improving sequential recommendation\u2014and FinalMLP [143], which combines dual MLP architectures with feature selection for effective Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction.\nChallenge with MLP: Despite their success, MLP models in RS face challenges like complexity, the risk of overfitting, lack of spatial invariance, issues with vanishing or exploding gradients, and explainability concerns.\nAutoencoders are neural network architectures specifically designed for unsupervised learning and are used for an effective dimensionality reduction method. An autoencoder comprises two components: an encoder for compressing input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder, which reconstructs the original data. Unlike traditional MLP models, autoencoders explicitly capture this encoding-decoding structure.\nNotable RS include AutoRec [144], Collaborative Filtering Autoencoder, Multi-Variational Auto-Encoder (Multi-VAE) [145], Deep Recommender (DeepRec) [146], Recommender Variational Auto-Encoder (RecVAE) [147], Item-based variational auto-encoder for fair recommendation [148], and the Variational Bandwidth Auto-Encoder (VBAE) hybrid RS [149]. These approaches address sparsity and noise challenges, making them effective for personalized recommendations.\nChallenge with Autoencoder: Autoencoders are powerful for dimensionality reduction and capturing complex data structures, but one key issue is their sensitivity to noise, which can lead to poor reconstructions if the input data is noisy [150]. Also, the reconstruction process might not always preserve meaningful patterns essential for recommendations.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn from visual, sequential, and multimodal data and have enhanced accuracy and personalization of recommendations. CNNs have been applied in RS in various settings. DeepCoNN analyzes text and visual cues to understand user preferences [87, 151]. CNNs are integrated with graph structures for scalable recommendation systems [120], employed in DKN for news recommendations [152], and utilized in MusicCNN for music recommendations based on audio signals [153]. CNN-based RS models predict next-item recommendations [130], recognize user preference patterns through CoCNN [154], and leverage collaborative filtering with CAGCN [155].\nChallenge with CNNs: CNNs in RS face challenges such as data sparsity, scalability, privacy, and domain-specific issues [156].

GNNs have emerged as a powerful tool in RS due to their capability to efficiently leverage complex, relational user-item interaction data, enhancing recommendation accuracy and personalization. GNNs in RS are highlighted in the related survey articles [48, 47], showcasing their significant impact and evolution in the domain.\nIn RS, a graph G = (V, E) represents the domain, with V denoting nodes (users and items) and E representing user-item interactions. Each node v \u2208 V is associated with a feature vector $x_v$. GNN-based models adapt to various graph types, including homogeneous (edges link nodes of a single type), heterogeneous (nodes and edges of multiple types), and hypergraphs (edges connect more than two nodes). The core operation in GNNs, message passing, involves nodes aggregating and updating information from neighbors to refine their features, thus capturing the dynamics of user-item interactions. This process enhances recommendation accuracy and personalization by utilizing the relational data within RS. The update mechanism for a node v at layer l is given by [47]:\n$h_v^{(l+1)} = UPDATE^{(l)} (h_v^{(l)}, AGGREGATE^{(l)} (\\{h_u^{(l)} : u \\in N(v)\\}))$ (5)\nHere, $h_v^{(l)}$ represents node v's feature vector at layer l, N(v) denotes v's neighbors, and $UPDATE^{(l)}$ and $AGGREGATE^{(l)}$ are the respective update and aggregation functions. The objective of GNN-based RS is to learn a predictive function f for estimating the interaction likelihood between user u and item i, utilizing their feature vectors $h_u$ and $h_i$:\n$\\hat{y}_{ui} = f(h_u, h_i; \\Theta)$ (6)\nIn this context, $\\hat{y}_{ui}$ is the interaction prediction score, with $\\Theta$ indicating the model parameters. Training involves minimizing a loss function L that compares predicted scores $\\hat{y}_{ui}$ with actual interactions $y_{ui}$:\n$L = \\sum_{(u,i) \\in D} loss(y_{ui}, \\hat{y}_{ui})$ (7)\nThis equation reflects the sum of losses over all observed user-item interactions in set D.\nState-of-the-art RS models using GNNs GNNs have progressively transformed RS, starting from the foundational model, i.e. Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion (GCMC) [189], which applies deep learning to user-item interaction graphs for effective link prediction. Building upon this, GraphSAGE [194] is an inductive framework utilizing node features for dynamic environments, though it could not address the complexity of real-world interaction data. Pinterest's PinSage [120] is a scalable model for web-scale graphs, improving its predecessor model for handling billions of nodes.\nThe Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) model [208] combines collaborative signals into user and item embeddings, enhancing recommendation quality at the expense of increased complexity. Knowledge Graph Attention Network (KGAT) [197] integrates knowledge graphs, improving recommendation diversity and explainability. The Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HGAT) [122] incorporates hierarchical attention into the RS, addressing the heterogeneity in relationships and node types.\nFeature Interaction Graph Neural Networks (Fi-GNN) [184] represented a shift towards capturing multifield feature interactions, notably in CTR prediction. Concurrently, Session-based Recommendation Graph Neural Network (SR-GNN) [216] tackled session-based recommendations, enhancing accuracy by capturing item transitions. The Multi-Modal Graph Convolution Network (MMGCN) [204] integrates multi-modal data into the graph-based learning, though facing scalability challenges.\nThe introduction of LightGCN [202], with its focus on neighborhood aggregation and streamlined architecture, represents a simplification in the GNN landscape, improving efficiency without compromising performance. MixGCF [203] brought forward a novel approach to negative sampling, optimizing training processes. Subsequent developments like GNNRec [187] and XSimGCL [222] advanced session-based and graph contrastive learning recommendations, respectively, addressing specific challenges such as social influence integration and bias mitigation. Ensuring trustworthiness in GNN-based RS requires enhancements in robustness, explainability, and fairness to ensure reliable recommendations [224].\nPractical Challenges Addressed GNNs can effectively address various practical challenges by modeling complex relationships in data. In e-commerce, models like LightGCN, GC-MC, NGCF, and Graph-ICF enhance personalization, scalability, and efficiency for rating, link, and item predictions. These models are capable of handling extensive product catalogs and large user bases efficiently. In social networks, GNNs such as GNN-SoR and GraphRec improve user interaction predictions, boosting content relevance and user engagement by understanding social dynamics and user relationships.

However, they often struggle with dynamically predicting user preferences, typically due to a narrow\nfocus on immediate past users' interactions or statistical correlations. This limitation is overcome by sequential RS [95], which exploit the temporal order and context of user interactions. The evolution of sequential RS has transitioned from Markov Chains and session-based KNN to sophisticated deep learning approaches, including RNNs, LSTMs, attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures.\nSequential recommendation is commonly viewed as a next-item or next-basket prediction challenge [37]. Both the sequential and session-based RS leverage user action sequences to anticipate users' future preferences [95]. Specifically, sequential RS consider the interaction histories of the users to predict future behaviour or users' preferences. In contrast, session-based RS, detailed in survey [38], focus on short-term user activity for real-time recommendations. These approaches collectively enhance personalization and relevance across diverse platforms.\nA sequential RS model can be defined as:\n$i_{next} = f(history(u))$,\nwhere $i_{next}$ is the next recommended item, $history(u)$ is the user u's interaction sequence, and f models sequential behavior to predict future interactions.\nA session-based RS model can be defined as:\n$i_{session-next} = g(S_{current})$,\nwith $i_{session-next}$ as the imminent session recommendation, $S_{current}$ representing the ongoing session interactions, and g predicting the next item considering the session's context.\nThe evolution of sequential and session-based RS has seen significant advancements with various models. For example, Translation-based RS (TransRec) [308], integrates third-order interactions to enhance sequential predictions. The research has progressed to using RNNs with GRU4Rec [158] and its enhancement, GRU4Rec+ [159], improving session-based recommendations through refined loss functions and sampling strategies.\nSubsequently, CNNs are applied in models like Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (Caser) [245] and NextItNet [130], targeting effective session-based recommendations. The introduction of self-attention mechanisms in Self-Attention based RS (SASRec) [161] for sequential model, and the exploration of item transitions with Session-based Recommendations with Graph Neural Networks (SR-GNN) [216], showed further progress.\nRecent developments have seen the application of the Transformers architecture, with models like Bert for RS (BERT4Rec) [228] using bidirectional self-attention for deep sequence analysis, and Transformers4Rec [247] adapting NLP transformers for recommendation contexts.\nGNNs have been employed for modeling session-based interactions in GRASER [219], and LightSANs [139] improved traditional Self-Attention Networks (SANs) by reducing complexity and refining sequence modeling with low-rank decomposed self-attention.\nFrequency Enhanced Hybrid Attention Network (FEARec) [240] and Knowledge Prompt-tuning for Sequential Recommendation (KP4SR) [241] advance sequential recommendation by leveraging hybrid attention mechanisms and integrating external knowledge bases, respectively, for better model performance.\nPractical Challenges Addressed Sequential and session-based RS effectively tackle practical challenges by capturing temporal dynamics and sequential patterns in user behavior. Models like TransRec, GRU4Rec, and GRU4Rec+ use recurrent neural networks to ensure scalability and computational efficiency, making them ideal for e-commerce and video streaming. Caser and NextItNet enhance these capabilities with convolutional layers, improving accuracy. SASRec and SR-GNN apply self-attention mechanisms and graph neural networks to capture complex user-item interactions in e-commerce and video games. BERT4Rec and Transformers4Rec leverage transformer architectures to model long-range dependencies, achieving high accuracy across datasets like Amazon Beauty, Steam, and MovieLens.\nThese models also have the ability to address data sparsity and cold start issues by considering both short-term session-based and long-term sequential preferences. They adapt to rapidly changing user interests and provide real-time recommendations, making them effective in industries like entertainment and news. For instance, in the news industry, they offer timely and relevant articles . In e-commerce, they track user interactions within a session to provide context-aware product suggestions, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing the likelihood of immediate purchases.

A KG is a directed graph G = (V, E), where V and E represent entities and relations between them, respectively, with E C V \u00d7 V. It includes entity type function $\\phi$ : V \u2192 A and relation type function $\\Psi$ : E \u2192 R, mapping entities to types A and relations to types R. KGs are depicted as sets of triples (en, r, et), signifying a relation r from en to et. This relational information helps RS understand user preferences and item relations, employing various methods to integrate KGs for improved recommendations. KG-based RS can be observed through three primary approaches: Embedding-based, Path-based, and Propagation-based approaches, each advancing the way RS leverage the rich relational data within KGs, as classified by [173].\nEmbedding-based approaches focus on learning and applying embeddings to represent KG entities (nodes) and relations (edges), enhancing user and item representations.

Given a set of states S, a set of actions A, a reward function R, a transition probability function P, and a discount factor y, the goal of the RL agent is to find a policy that maximizes the expected, discounted cumulative reward over time.

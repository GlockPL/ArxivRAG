Specifically,\nthey \"model the underlying semantic structure of a domain and provide semantics, navigation, and\ntranslation through labels, definitions, typing, relationships, and properties for concepts\" (Zeng, 2008).\nIn the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relation-\nships (Sugimoto and Larivi\u00e9re, 2018), with the primary aim of classifying research articles, books, courses,\npatents, grants, software, experiment materials, scientific venues, domain experts, organisations, and\nseveral other relevant items and agents. These structured representation of knowledge have been adopted\nby most academic fields and proved very effective in i) improving the retrievability of relevant documents\n(Newman et al., 2010; Salatino et al., 2019), ii) enabling advanced analytic solutions to quantify the\nimpact of research (Ding et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2017; Sugimoto and Larivi\u00e9re, 2018; Salatino et al.,\n2023), and iii) understanding and forecasting research dynamics (Scharnhorst et al., 2012; Qiu et al.,\n2017).\nMore recently, these KOSs have become even more instrumental given the fast-growing number of\npublications, the rise of Open Science and Open Access articles, the thriving role of interdisciplinary\nresearch, and the emergence of vast online repositories of articles, academic courses, and other academic\nmaterials (Auer et al., 2018).

KOSs are commonly used to categorise items into\nspecific classes. In this context, classes correspond to research topics within various disciplines. The\nitems categorised can include a wide range of artefacts, such as documents (e.g., research papers, patents,\nproject reports), videos (e.g., university courses), datasets, software, projects, and more. As proposed\nin Salatino (2019), we define a research topic as the subject of study or issue that is of interest to the\nacademic community, and it is explicitly addressed by research papers. Examples of research topics are"}, {"title": "3.2 Selection criteria", "content": "In this section, we define standard inclusion (IC) and exclusion (EC) criteria for the survey.\nWe selected all KOSs which match the following inclusion criteria:\nIC 1. they describe academic research topics as defined in Sec. 3.1;\nIC 2. they cover at least one of the following 19 broad research fields: \u201cArt\u201d, \u201cBiology\", \"Business\",\n\u201cChemistry\u201d, \u201cComputer science\u201d, \u201cEconomics\u201d, \u201cEngineering\u201d, \u201cEnvironmental science\", \"Geog-\nraphy\", \"Geology\u201d, \u201cHistory\u201d, \u201cMaterials science\u201d, \u201cMathematics\u201d, \u201cMedicine\u201d, \u201cPhilosophy\",\n\u201cPhysics\u201d, \u201cPolitical science\u201d, \u201cPsychology\u201d, and \u201cSociology\u201d;\nIC 3. they are adopted by the main bibliographic databases or regularly used by the scientific community.\nFor the IC 2, we adopted the top-level fields of the Microsoft's Fields of Study (Sinha et al., 2015)\ndue to their comprehensive coverage.\nIn contrast, we excluded KOSs that match the following criteria:\nEC 1. do not offer an English version;\nEC 2. are exclusively tailored to the content of a specific library and therefore are not adopted by a\ncommunity of users.\nWe established the EC 2 criterion because there is an abundance of KOSs created by specific libraries\n(e.g., the Aarhus University Library Classification System) for internal needs, but not available or (re)used\nby the scientific community."}, {"title": "3.3 Methodology for the retrieval of relevant KOSS", "content": "Identifying all the relevant KOSs has proven to be a challenging task. A common approach, when pursuing\na survey or a review of the literature, is to rely on a search engine, e.g., Scopus, Web of Science, Google\nScholar, and construct a particular query that would return all research papers reporting the objects under\nreview (Pranckut\u0117, 2021). However, a good number of systems organising research areas are not well\ndescribed or documented in research papers. Therefore, relying on this typical approach would have\nproduced limited results. To this end, we designed and performed the following systematic strategy.\nPhase 1: We started by querying Google Scholar for potential candidates using the following query\n\"(controlled vocabulary OR taxonomy OR thesaurus OR ontology OR subject headings OR subject\nclassification) AND (research OR science)\".\nDue to Google Scholar's limitations with logical operators, we executed the queries individually\nand then combined the resulting papers. In this phase, we gathered: i) WikiCSSH (Han et al., 2020),\nii) Computer Science Ontology (Salatino et al., 2018b), iii) Medical Subject Headings (Darmoni\net al., 2012), iv) Library of Congress Classification (Summers et al., 2008), v) Modern Science\nOntology (Fathalla et al., 2023), vi) Science Metrix Classification (Archambault et al., 2011), and\nvii) OpenAIRE's Field of Science Taxonomy (Kotitsas et al., 2023).\nPhase 2: We analysed the websites of academic publishers, pre-print archives, and academic search\nengines to identify the KOSs they use to organise their content. Specifically, we considered Scopus,\nWeb of Science, Microsoft Academic Graph, Dimensions.ai, PubMed, the Springer Nature portal,\nACM, IEEE, OpenAlex, and ArXiv. As a result, we identified: i) ACM Computing Classification\nScheme, ANZSRC ii) Fields of Research, iii) ArXiv Subjects, Microsoft's, iv) Fields of Study,\nv) Nature Subjects, vi) IEEE Thesaurus, vii) Web of Science Categories, viii) All Science Journal\nClassification Codes of Scopus, and ix) OpenAlex Topics.\nPhase 3: We adopted the Google search engine to identify additional KOSs, using the query \"(con-\ntrolled vocabulary\" OR \"term list\" OR \"taxonomy\" OR \"thesaurus\" OR \"ontology\" OR \"subject\nheadings\" OR \"subject classification\")\" in combination with the 19 broad fields listed in IC 2.\nAs a result, we identified: i) Art and Architecture Thesaurus, ii) Biomedical Ontologies from\nBioPortal, iii) ChemOnt, iv) GeoRef Thesaurus, v) KNOWMAK, vi) Journal of Economic Literature,\nvii) Mathematics Subject Classification, viii) U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System,\nix) PhilPapers Taxonomy, x) Physical Subject Headings, xi) PsycInfo and PsycTests Classification\nSystems, and xii) Subject Resource Application Ontology.\nPhase 4: We contacted researchers working in the field of \"Digital Libraries\" and asked them whether\nthey could point us toward any additional effort. As a result, we gathered: i) Dewey Decimal\nClassification and ii) Unified Medical Language System.\nPhase 5: We expanded the resulting KOSs by analysing their links on Wikipedia. Specifically, we relied\non the \"See also\" section, which typically lists online databases and other related KOSs. As a result,\nwe gathered: i) STW Thesaurus for Economics, ii) Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme,\niii) Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology, iv) National Library of Medicine classification, and\nv) Fields of research and development.\nPhase 6: We retrieved and considered all the KOSs that are explicitly linked into the already selected\nones. Thanks to this process, we included: i) Agrovoc Thesaurus, ii) DFG Classification, iii) EDAM,\niv) TheSoz, ANZSRC's v) Socio-Economic Objective, ASRC's vi) Research Fields, Courses and\nDisciplines, vii) EuroVoc, and viii) Unesco Thesaurus.\nPhase 7: Whenever we could not find at least one KOS within one of the 19 disciplines defined in IC2\n(e.g., \"History\"), we reached out to professors in the missing disciplines, asking which KOS they\nemploy, if any. Their response directed us toward multi-field KOS such as i) European Commission\nTaxonomy and ii) European Research Council Taxonomy."}, {"title": "3.4 Methodology for the analysis of KOSS", "content": "We analysed each KOS according to the five main aspects summarised in Figure 2: Scope, Structure,\nCuration, External Links, and Usage.\nScope. The scope is the set of research fields covered by a KOS. Some KOSs focus on one specific\nfield, such as PhySH for \"Physics\" or Mathematics Subject Classification for \u201cMathematics\". These\nmay also include elements from other complementary fields. This is the case of PhilPapers Taxonomy\nthat mainly focuses on \u201cPhilosophy\", but also describes some concepts from other fields, including\n\u201cMathematics\u201d. Another category of KOSs covers multiple fields by design, typically because they aim to\noffer good coverage of the full set of scientific or academic disciplines. A good example is the Unesco\nThesaurus, a well-known knowledge organization system which aims to cover all academic disciplines\nand is adopted by several libraries.\nStructure. The structural characteristics of a KOS include many aspects based on its topology and\nthe way subjects are arranged. First, we classified each KOS according to the four types defined in\nSec. 3.1: term lists, taxonomies, thesauri, and ontologies. For example, the Web of Science Categories is\na flat list of terms, and thus, we characterised it as a term list. The Mathematics Subject Classification\nand ANZSRC's Fields of Research are taxonomies since they arrange topics in a hierarchy. The IEEE\nThesaurus is a thesaurus as it offers hierarchical information as well as synonyms. Finally, TheSoz is an\nontology because, in addition to the hierarchical structure and synonyms, it adds axioms and constraints.\nWe then considered the number of concepts and the maximum depth of the hierarchical tree (which\nmay be one in the case of term lists). The depth was computed as the number of levels from the most\ngeneric concept (root) to the most specific concepts (leaves). Depth can be generally used as an indicator\nof specificity, since deep taxonomies tend to include a granular representation of very detailed (narrow)\ntopics and may allow for more fine-grained content organisation.\nIf the KOS is hierarchical, we also characterised it as either mono-hierarchical or poly-hierarchical\naccording to the type of employed hierarchy. In mono-hierarchical KOSs, each concept is assigned to a\nsingle-parent category. In contrast, poly-hierarchical KOS enable concepts to belong to multiple parent\ncategories. As we will see, some KOSs attempt to organise their concepts within a strict mono-hierarchical\""}, {"title": "4 ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS", "content": "This section analyses the KOSs of research fields utilising the 15 features reported in Fig. 2.

In contrast, term lists and thesauri were less represented, with only\none (Web of Science Categories) and three KOSs (UMLS, IEEE Thesaurus, and GeoRef Thesaurus),\nrespectively.\nThis scenario suggests a clear division between the two approaches to categorising research topics.\nOn one side, some communities prefer to use straightforward hierarchical taxonomies, often encoded in\nvery simple formats or structured documents. On the other side, other communities embrace the richer\nexpressivity of ontologies, which enable detailed descriptions of research topics, the relationships between\nthem (e.g., causal, contributory, part/whole, and ancestral), and constraints (Kendall and McGuinness,\n2019). Thesauri may be less common because they are more complex than hierarchical taxonomies but\nlack the full expressive power of ontologies."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Number of concepts", "content": "The number of concepts within KOSs varies widely, spanning from smaller systems like Fields of Research\nand Development (48 concepts) to vast ontologies like the Biomedical Ontologies from BioPortal (13\nmillion concepts).

Sixteen single-field\nKOSs exceed this median in concept count, while sixteen of the multi-field KOSs contain fewer concepts.\nThis pattern suggests a trend: single-field KOSs tend to be larger and more specialised, likely to capture\nthe intricacies within their specific domains. In contrast, multi-field KOSs seem to be designed to offer a\nbroader overview across various fields, often resulting in a smaller number of concepts.\nThe six multi-field KOSs that exceed the median number of concepts, thereby providing a more\ngranular representation of topics, are OpenAlex Taxonomy (4,798 concepts), EuroVoc (7,423), OpenAIRE's\nField of Science \u0422\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443 (50K), Dewey Decimal Classification (60K), Library of Congress Classification\n(467K), and Microsoft's Fields of Study (704K)."}, {"title": "4.2.3 Depth", "content": "Similarly to the number of concepts, the depth of KOSs also displays considerable variety, ranging from 1\n(Web of Science Categories) to 39 (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology).

When examining the 23 single-field KOSs, it is interesting to note that\npoly-hierarchical structures (14) outnumber mono-hierarchical ones (9). In contrast, multi-field systems\nexhibit a nearly equal distribution, with 11 mono-hierarchical and 10 poly-hierarchical structures.

Nonetheless, the CC BY license remains the\nmost prevalent.\nEleven KOSs are freely accessible online but maintain copyright restrictions, meaning that they can\nbe browsed but cannot be downloaded, modified, or redistributed without explicit permission from the\ncopyright holder.\nTwo KOSs are free from copyright: Medical Subject Headings and National Library of Medicine\nclassification. Four KOSs are copyrighted and inaccessible online. For instance, both the Dewey Decimal\nClassification and the Library of Congress Classification necessitate licensing fees even for browsing\npurposes.\nFinally, Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology and Biomedical Ontologies from BioPortal rep-\nresent broader initiatives that integrate multiple ontologies.

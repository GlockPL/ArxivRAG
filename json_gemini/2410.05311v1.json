However, the \"black box\" nature of these models often leaves users and researchers in the dark about how specific decisions are made [6,11]. Understanding the internal workings of these networks is crucial for improving their reliability and trustworthiness. A promising approach to make them more interpretable is to associate the activations of neurons in their hidden layers with human-understandable concepts [2,7,4]. Prior work [2] has focused on identifying the concepts that maximally activate each neuron correspond-ing to the notion of recall. However, solely optimizing for recall is insufficient, as neurons tend to also activate for many other inputs that do not match their assigned concept (low precision).\nTo address this limitation, we present a visualizing tool, ConceptLens, that quantifies the uncertainty and imprecision in neural concept labels through error margins. ConceptLens leverages the principles outlined in the research paper [3], which uses symbolic Semantic Web methods to automatically induce semantic concept labels for individual neurons from a large knowledge base made from Wikipedia categories and evaluate their precision by analyzing the false positive rates of neuron activations. This approach allows users to see not only what stimuli activate specific neurons but also how confidently these neurons respond to different inputs."}, {"title": "2 Method", "content": "System Overview The core idea behind ConceptLens is to provide bar chart visualizations that contextualize the certainty of each detected concept based on the neuron activations. ConceptLens combines a Convolutional Neural Net-work (CNN) trained on specific image classes with symbolic reasoning techniques (Concept Induction) to assign semantically meaningful labels to the neurons in the final dense layer from a knowledge base of 2 million concepts. The system's backend processes images to detect concepts and calculate error-margin percent-ages, indicating the confidence level of each activation.\nError-Margin Analysis The core innovation of ConceptLens lies in its error-margin analysis. This measure assesses the likelihood that a given neuron ac-tivation accurately corresponds to the assigned concept by evaluating how fre-quently neurons activate for concepts not assigned to them on a holdout set of images. Lower error-margin percentages indicate higher confidence, while higher percentages suggest greater uncertainty. This dual focus on recall (identifying activating stimuli) and precision (evaluating responses to non-target stimuli) provides a comprehensive understanding of neuron behavior.\nUser Interface ConceptLens features a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload images and receive real-time visualizations of neuron activations. The main components of the interface include:\n1. Image Upload and Selection: Users can upload their images or choose from a curated gallery. The tool supports a wide range of images, although results may vary for images outside the 10 classes it was primarily trained on: bathroom, bedroom, building facade, conference room, dining room, highway, kitchen, living room, skyscraper, and street.\n2. Concept Detection and Visualization: ConceptLens processes the up-loaded image through trained CNN and Concept Induction to detect relevant concepts. The detected concepts are then presented as bar chart visualiza-tion and their corresponding error-margin percentages, providing users with a clear understanding of the network's predictions.\n3. Error-Margin Display: The interface highlights the error-margin percent-ages for each detected concept, allowing users to gauge the confidence of the network's predictions. Lower percentages indicate higher confidence in the concept detection.\nTechnical Details ConceptLens utilizes a ResNet50V2 architecture for its CNN, trained on a subset of the ADE20K dataset. The network's last hidden layer neurons are analyzed (see [2]) and labeled using an OWL-reasoning-based Concept Induction algorithm (ECII, [9]) over a large background knowledge base derived from Wikipedia [10]. This assigns high-level concepts to neurons, facilitating the error-margin analysis.\nError margins are calculated by evaluating neuron activations across a large dataset of images from Google and ADE20K (see [3]). This includes both target"}, {"title": "3 Conclusion", "content": "Concept Lens represents a pioneering advancement in explainable AI, offering a robust tool for visualizing and interpreting hidden neuron activations within neu-ral networks.

[{"title": "Provably-Safe Neural Network Training Using Hybrid Zonotope Reachability Analysis", "authors": ["Long Kiu Chung", "Shreyas Kousik"], "abstract": "Abstract-Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, it remains difficult to enforce constraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in such settings. Towards addressing this, many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's satisfaction of safety constraints, but do not address how to correct an \"unsafe\" network. On the other hand, the few works that extract a training signal from verification cannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To address these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training method that can encourage the exact reachable set of a non-convex input set through a neural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a non-convex unsafe region, using recent results in non-convex set representation with hybrid zonotopes and extracting gradient information from mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). The proposed method is fast, with the computational complexity of each training iteration comparable to that of solving a linear program (LP) with number of dimensions and constraints linear to the number of neurons and complexity of input and unsafe sets. For a neural network with three hidden layers of width 30, the method was able to drive the reachable set of a non-convex input set with 55 generators and 26 constraints out of a non-convex unsafe region with 21 generators and 11 constraints in 490 seconds.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Neural networks are universal approximators [1] that have seen success in many domains. However, they are also well-known as \"black-box\" models, where the relationship between their inputs and outputs is not easily interpretable or directly analyzable due to non-linearity and high-dimensional parameterizations. As such, it is very difficult to certify their safety (e.g. satisfaction of constraints). This limitation imposes many significant drawbacks. For example, robots crash frequently when training their neural network controllers with deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, limiting deep RL's success in robots where hardware failures are costly, simulations are not readily available, or the sim-to-real gap is too large for reliable performance [2]. In addition, neural networks can also be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where minor perturbations in the input can lead to drastically different results in the output [3], [4]. This makes deploying neural networks in safety-critical tasks a questionable choice, even though it has already been widely done [5]-[7], leading to many injuries and accidents [8]. In this paper, we present a method to enforce safety in neural networks by encouraging their satisfaction of a collision-free constraint, which has potential application in making deep RL safe, neural networks robust to adversarial attacks, and more. An overview of our method is shown in Fig. 1."}, {"title": "A. Related Work", "content": "We now review three key approaches to enforce constraints on neural network: sampling-based approaches that do not have formal guarantees, verification approaches that only check constraint satisfaction, and approaches that combine verification with training, which our method belongs to. Finally, we review relevant literature on hybrid zonotopes, which is the set representation used in our method.\n1) Training with Soft Constraints: Many existing work capture safety in neural networks by penalizing constraint violations on sampled points during training [9]-[13]. However, these soft approaches, while often fast and easy to implement, do not provide any safety guarantees beyond the training samples. While there are works that are capable of enforcing hard constraints in neural networks by modifying the training process [14], [15], they can only handle simple affine constraints.\n2) Neural Network Verification: A different approach is to certify safety with respect to a set of inputs. Methods in this category tend to analyze the reachable set (i.e. image) of the input set through the neural network, either exactly [16]-[20] or as an over-approximation [16]\u2013[18], [21]\u2013[23] depending on the choice of set representation. That said, most of these works only focus on neural network verification. That is, these methods only answer the yes-no question of \"safe\" or \"unsafe\", with the aftermath of fixing an \"unsafe\u201d network left largely unexplored. As a result, engineers can only train via trial-and-error until the desired safety properties have been achieved, which can be slow and ineffective.\n3) Training with Verification: To the best of our knowledge, there are only two works that attempted to extract learning signals from the safety verification results using reachability analysis.\nFirst, in [24], given an input set as an H-polytope (i.e. polytope represented by intersection of halfplanes) and a neural network controller embedded in a nonlinear dynamical system, the polytope is expressed as the projection of a high-dimensional hyperrectangle, enabling the use of the CROWN verifier [21] for interval reachability. Then, using a loss function that encourages the vector field of the reachable set to point inwards, the authors were able to train the neural network until the system is forward invariant. With this method, the input set is limited to being a convex polytope. Moreover, since [21] and the interval reachability techniques used are over-approximations, its space of discoverable solutions may be limited.\nSecond, given an input set and an unsafe region expressed as constrained zonotopes (a convex polytopic representation [25]), our prior work [26] computed the exact reachable set of a neural network as a union of constrained zonotopes. Then, by using a loss function to quantify the \"emptiness\" of the intersection between the reachable set and the unsafe region, we were able to train the neural network such that the reachable set no longer collides with the unsafe region. Similarly, the input set and the obstacle in this method is limited to being a convex polytope. Moreover, the number of sets needed to represent the reachable set grows exponentially with the size of the neural network, making the method numerically intractable even for very small neural networks.\n4) Hybrid Zonotopes: Recently, a non-convex polytopic set representation called the hybrid zonotope [27] was proposed. Hybrid zonotopes are closed under affine mapping, Minkowski sum, generalized intersection, intersection [27], union, and complement [28], with extensive toolbox support in MATLAB [29] and Python [30]. They can also exactly represent the forward reachable set (image) [19] and backward reachable set (preimage) [31] of a neural network with rectified linear units (ReLU) using basic matrix operations, with complexity scaling only linearly with the size of the network. However, existing methods for hybrid zonotopes enforce safety on robots either by formulating a model predictive control (MPC) [28] or a nonlinear optimization problem [32] without neural networks in the loop, whereas those with neural networks only use hybrid zonotope for verification but not training [19], [31], [33], [34]. In this paper, our contribution is extracting and using learning signals from neural network reachability analysis with hybrid zonotopes."}, {"title": "B.

PROBLEM STATEMENT", "content": "Our goal in this paper is to design a ReLU neural network training method such that the reachable set of a given input set through the network avoids some unsafe regions. As per most other training methods, we assume that the structure (i.e. depth and widths) of the ReLU neural network is fixed as a user choice, and we focus only on updating its weights and biases (a.k.a. trainable parameters). Mathematically, we want to tackle the following problem:\nProblem 1 (Training the Reachable Set of a Neural Network to Avoid Unsafe Regions). Given an input set $Z = \\mathcal{HZ}(G_{c,z}, G_{b,z}, c_{z}, A_{c,z}, A_{b,z}, b_{z}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n_{o}}$ with $n_{g, z}$ continuous generators, $n_{b, z}$ binary generators, and $n_{c, z}$ constraints, an unsafe region $U = \\mathcal{HZ}(G_{c,u}, G_{b,u}, c_{u}, A_{c,u}, A_{b,u}, b_{u}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n_{d}}$ with $n_{g, u}$ continuous generators, $n_{b, u}$ binary generators, and $n_{c, u}$ constraints, and a ReLU neural network $\\xi$ with fixed depth $d$ and widths $n_{o}, \\dots, n_{d}$, we want to find $W_{1}, \\dots, W_{d}, w_{1}, \\dots, w_{d}$ such that\n$\\mathcal{Q} := \\{\\xi(x) \\mid x \\in Z\\} \\cap U = \\emptyset$.\nOf course, a trivial solution would be to set $W_{d} = 0$ and $w_{d} \\notin U$, but this kind of solution is not useful. Instead, we aim to design a differentiable loss function such that (7) can be achieved by following a gradient and updating the trainable parameters via backpropagation [35]. Doing so allows our method to integrate with other loss functions to achieve additional objectives, as well as makes the training applicable to ReLU networks with other structural constraints, such as when they are embedded in a dynamical system [5]-[7]."}, {"title": "IV.

Hybrid Zonotope Emptiness Check", "content": "Before constructing a loss function for training, we first need a way to check whether (7) is true. From (2) and (5), the left-hand side of (7), $\\mathcal{Q}$, can be straightforwardly computed as a hybrid zonotope $\\mathcal{HZ}(G_{c, \\mathcal{Q}}, G_{b, \\mathcal{Q}}, c_{\\mathcal{Q}}, A_{c, \\mathcal{Q}}, A_{b, \\mathcal{Q}}, b_{\\mathcal{Q}}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n_{d}}$ with $n_{g, \\mathcal{Q}} = n_{g, z} + n_{n} + 4 n n + n_{g, u}$ continuous generators, $n_{b, \\mathcal{Q}} = n_{b, z} + n_{n} + n_{b, u}$ binary generators, and $n_{c, \\mathcal{Q}} = n_{c, z} + n_{n} + 3 n n + n_{d}$ constraints.

Note that (8) is NP-complete [36]. However, not only is it not always feasible, it is also unclear how to derive a loss function from the optimizers to drive $\\mathcal{Q}$ to be empty.

This follows from the definition of hybrid zonotope in (1).\nBy construction, (9) is feasible as long as $\\exists z_{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{g}}, z_{b} \\in \\{-1, 1\\}^{n_{b}}$ such that $A_{c} z_{c} + A_{b} z_{b} = b$. If this condition is not met for $\\mathcal{Q}$, then we have $\\mathcal{Q} = \\emptyset$ anyway and no training is needed. Importantly, it has been shown in [26] that the minimum upper bound of the norm of the continuous coefficients is useful for gauging the extent of collision between two constrained zonotopes, which are subsets of a hybrid zonotope.

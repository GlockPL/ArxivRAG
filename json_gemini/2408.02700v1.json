It will\nbe assumed that buyers can order in advance. An inventory problem is a math-\nematical model that describes the management of this company.\nThere are mathematical models in which the management activity of the\ncompany is carried out in a single period and models with several periods. The\ninventory models can also be classified according to the attitude towards risk of\na decision-maker: there are models in which the decision maker has a risk-averse\nattitude and models in which his attitude is neutral.\nThe mathematical formulation of the inventory model starts from the fol-\nlowing initial data (model parameters): $c_1,..., c_n$ are unit fixed costs per in-\nventoried item, $d_1,..., d_n$ are unit revenues per inventoried item and $h_1,..., h_n$\nare unit holding costs per inventoried item.\nThe demands are mathematically modeled by the variables $D_1,\\ldots, D_n$; the\norder quantities will be the variables $x_1,...,x_n$. The total profit from the\nsale of the n types of goods will have the following expression:: $\\pi(\\vec{x}, \\vec{D})$ =\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n (d_i x_i - c_i - \\frac{h_i x_i^2}{2D_i})$ (see [23], [18]).\nIn a neutral inventory problem, one will determine those values of $x_1,..., x_n$\nfor which the total profit $\\pi(\\vec{x}, \\vec{D}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n (d_i x_i - c_i - \\frac{h_i x_i^2}{2D_i})$ is maximal. When\nmaking the decision the risk is taken into account, the values of $x_1,..., x_n$ will\nbe determined so that at the same time the maximum profit is achieved, and\nthe risk (represented by various mathematical concepts) to be minimal.\nThe formulation of an inventory problem depends on how the demands\n$D_1,\\ldots, D_n$ are modeled, as well as on how profit maximization and risk min-\nimization are evaluated. The classical treatment of inventory problems is a\nprobabilistic one: the demands $D_1,\\ldots, D_n$ are random variables and, for risk\nneutral models, the objective function of the maximization problem is the ex-\npected value of the total profit. In the case of a risk averse attitude of the\ndecision maker, several ways to describe the risk were proposed: in [6], [7] by\nmeans of mean-variance models and in [29] by using the value-at-risk (VaR) as\na risk measure. In [1], the coherent risk measures [2] have been used in defining\nthe objective function of an inventory problem. Using the multi-item inventory\nsystem introduced by Luciano et al. [29] (called, shortly, LCP-model), [3] devel-\noped several inventory problems, with decision-makers having various positions\ntowards risk: from a neutral attitude to risk-averse attitude, corresponding to\nvariance, mean-absolute deviation (MAD) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)\nas risk measures.\nThe credibility theory, specially developed by Liu in [27], is another way\nto model the fuzzy uncertainty. Its fundamental concept is the credibilistic\nmeasure [28] and its main indicators are the credibilistic expected value and\nthe credibilistic variance (cf. [27], [28]). From the literature dedicated to the\ncredibilistic treatment of inventory problems we mention the papers: [17], [19],\n[23], [30]. In this paper we will have as the starting point the papers [24], [25],\n[26] of Li and Liu: the first one concerns a multi - item inventory problem\nin which the decision maker is neutral and the second one is a risk - averse\ninventory model. In both papers, the demands and the total profits are fuzzy\nvariables and the expected profit is the credibilistic expected value of total profit.\nIn [25] appears a risk evaluated by the notion of absolute semi - deviation.\nIn [34], Yang and Iwamura introduced a new measure $m_\\lambda$ as a convex linear"}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "Let X be a universe whose elements can be individuals, objects, states, alter-\nnatives, etc. An events A is a subset of X: the set of events will be the family\n$\\mathcal{P}(X)$ of subsets of X. The complement of the event A will be denoted by $A^c$.\nIn this paper we shall assume that the elements of the universe X are real\nnumbers ($\\mathbb{X}\\subset \\mathbb{R}$). A fuzzy variable will be an arbitrary function $\\xi : X \\rightarrow R$.\nThe notions of possibility measure and necessity measure can be introduced\nboth axiomatically and through a possibility distribution (cf. [33], [10], [13]).\nA possibility measure on X is a function $Pos : \\mathcal{P}(X) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that\n(Pos1) $Pos(\\emptyset) = 0$; $Pos(X) = 1$;\n(Pos2) $Pos(\\cup_{i\\in I} A_i) = \\sup_{i\\in I}Pos(A_i)$, for any family $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$ of events.\nA necessity measure on X is a function $Nec : \\mathcal{P}(X) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that\n(Nec1) $Nec(\\emptyset) = 0$; $Nec(X) = 1$;\n(Nec2) $Nec(\\cap_{i\\in I} A_i) = \\inf_{i\\in I}Nec(A_i)$, for any family $(A_i)_{i\\in I}$ of events.\nThe notions of possibility measure and necessity measure are dual: to each\npossibility measure Pos one can assign a necessity measure $Nec(A) = 1 -$\n$Pos(A^c)$ and, vice-versa, to each necessity measure Nec one can assign a possi-\nbility measure $Pos(A) = 1 - Nec(A^c)$.\nGiven a possibility measure $Pos$ on the universe X, for any parameter $\\lambda \\in$\n$[0, 1]$ consider the function $m_\\lambda : \\mathcal{P}(X) \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ defined by\n(2.1) $m_\\lambda(A) = \\lambda Pos(A) + (1 - \\lambda)Nec(A)$, for any event A;\n(Nec is here the necessity measure associated with Pos).\nThis new measure was introduced by Yang and Iwamura in [34] as a convex\nlinear combination of Pos and Nec by means of the weight $\\lambda$. If $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ then one\nobtains the notion of credibility measure in the sense of Liu's monograph [27]:\n(2.2) $Cred(A) = \\frac{1}{2} (Pos(A) + Nec(A))$, for any event A.\nA possibilistic distribution on X is a function $\\mu : X \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that\n$\\sup_{x\\in X} \\mu(x) = 1$; $\\mu$ is normalized if $\\mu(x) = 1$ for some $x \\in X$.\nLet us fix a possibility distribution $\\mu : X \\rightarrow [0, 1]$. Then one can associate\nwith $\\mu$ a possibility measure Pos and a necessity measure Nec by taking\n(2.3) $Pos(A) = \\sup_{x\\in A} \\mu(x)$, for any event A;\n(2.4) $Nec(A) = \\inf_{x\\in A} \\mu(x)$, for any event A.\nThen for each parameter $\\lambda\\in [0, 1]$, the measure $m_\\lambda$ defined by (2.1) will\nhave the following form\n(2.5) $m_\\lambda(A) = \\lambda \\sup_{x\\in A} \\mu(x) + (1 - \\lambda)\\inf_{x\\in A}\\mu(x)$, for any event A.\nAccording to [27], we say that the normalized possibility distribution $\\mu$ is\nthe membership function associated with a fuzzy variable $\\xi$ if for any event A\nwe have\n(2.6) $Pos(\\xi\\in A) = \\sup_{x\\in A} \\mu(x)$.\nThen the following equalities hold:\n(2.7) $Nec(\\xi\\in A) = \\inf_{x\\in A} \\mu(x)$;\n(2.8) $m_\\lambda (\\xi\\in A) = \\lambda \\sup_{x\\in A} \\mu(x) + (1 - \\lambda)\\inf_{x\\in A}\\mu(x)$."}, {"title": "3 The expected value associated with the mea-\nsure mx", "content": "We fix a parameter $\\lambda\\in [0, 1]$ and assume that $\\xi$ is a fuzzy variable, $\\mu$ is its\nmembership function and $m_\\lambda$ is the measure defined in (2.5).\nFollowing [11], the expected value of $\\xi$ w.r.t. the measure $m_\\lambda$ is defined by\n(3.1) $E_\\lambda(\\xi) = \\int_0^{\\infty} [m_\\lambda(\\xi > r) - 1]dr + \\int_{-\\infty}^0 m_\\lambda(\\xi \\geq r)dr$.\nIf $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ then one obtains the credibilistic expected value of $\\xi$ w.r.t. the\ncredibility measure $Cr$ defined in (2.2):\n(3.2) $E_c(\\xi) = \\int_0^{\\infty} Cr(\\xi \\geq r)dr - \\int_{-\\infty}^0 Cr(\\xi < r)dr$.\nThe previous notion of credibilistic expected value was introduced by Liu\nand Liu in [28].\nThe following result shows that the expected operator $E_\\lambda(\\cdot)$ is linear.\nProposition 3.1 [11] Let $\\xi_1, \\xi_2$ be two fuzzy variables such that $E_\\lambda(\\xi_1) < \\infty$,\n$E_\\lambda(\\xi_2) < \\infty$ and $\\alpha, \\beta$ are two non - negative real numbers.

By Proposition 4.4, solutions $x_1^\\ast,...,x_n^\\ast$ and\n$y_1^\\ast,..., y_n^\\ast$ are written in the following form:\n(8.1) $x_i^\\ast = \\frac{d_i}{h_i E_{\\lambda_1}(\\frac{1}{D_i})}$ for $i = 1,...,n$.\n(8.2) $y_i^\\ast = \\frac{d_i}{h_i E_{\\lambda_2}(\\frac{1}{D_i})}$ for $i = 1,...,n$.\nApplying Lemma 8.1 for any $i = 1, ..., n$ the following implications hold:\n(8.3) $\\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\Rightarrow E_{\\lambda_1} (\\frac{1}{D_i}) \\leq E_{\\lambda_2}(\\frac{1}{D_i}) \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{E_{\\lambda_2}(\\frac{1}{D_i})} \\leq \\frac{1}{E_{\\lambda_1}(\\frac{1}{D_i})}$\nBy (8.1)-(8.3) for any $i = 1,...,n$ we will have:\n$x_i^\\ast - y_i^\\ast = \\frac{d_i}{h_i} (\\frac{1}{E_{\\lambda_1}(\\frac{1}{D_i})} - \\frac{1}{E_{\\lambda_2}(\\frac{1}{D_i})}) \\geq 0$.\nWe conclude that $x_i^\\ast \\geq y_i^\\ast$ for any $i = 1,...,n."}]}

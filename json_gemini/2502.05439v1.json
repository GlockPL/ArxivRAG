{"title": "AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS APPLIED TO TASKS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES: MODELING AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT CREWS", "authors": ["IZUNNA OKPALA", "ASHKAN GOLGOON", "ARJUN RAVI KANNAN"], "abstract": "The advent of large language models has ushered in a new era of agentic systems, where artificial intelligence programs exhibit remarkable autonomous decision-making capabilities across diverse domains. This paper explores agentic system workflows in the financial services industry. In particular, we build agentic crews that can effectively collaborate to perform complex modeling and model risk management (MRM) tasks. The modeling crew consists of a manager and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a manager along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool in natural language processing, capable of generating and understanding textual data that mimic human behavior. One of the interesting applications of LLMs is their ability to engage in role-playing, where they can simulate various personas, perspectives, or even multiple roles within a conversation [46, 44, 8, 50]. Multi-agent systems leverage the phenomenal role-playing abilities of individual LLM agents through effective debate and collaboration to perform complex tasks and achieve shared goals [6, 54, 76, 44, 31, 20, 13]. Such tasks often surpass what a single highly capable LLM agent can accomplish [6, 13].\nRecent research in LLM multi-agent systems has demonstrated considerable potential by equipping collaborative agents with specialized tools, resulting in advanced problem-solving skills in different domains [66, 30].\nMulti-agent systems have made great leaps in simulating human-like decision-making processes [68, 55, 35, 44, 12, 8]. Recently, [44] introduced agents that can simulate emergent social behavior. The so-called generative agents can initiate and engage in conversations, notice each other, and form opinions. Generative agents are enabled through an architecture that consists of three components, namely memory stream, reflection, and planning. The memory stream records a long-term memory of the agent's experiences, which,"}, {"title": "2. AGENTIC SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURES", "content": "In this section, we briefly review some important elements of agentic systems architecture and its general components (see [58, 54, 9, 11] for further details).\n2.1. Agentic Systems Components. Agentic systems utilize LLMs as their knowledge-bank and are equipped with predefined functions to create a plan for a given task, collaborate with one another, and leverage a wide variety of tools to execute the plan [58]. An agent is typically characterized by the following general components, namely agent core, memory module, tools, and planning module (see Figure 1).\nThe agent core contains information about the core NLP engine (such as GPTs), the agent's goals, tools, memory, and persona.\nThe memory module consists of short-term and long-term memories. The short-term memory tracks immediate context and actions, while the long-term memory stores information across multiple prior sessions, enabling more personalized interaction to be provided by the agent [58].\nTools are external systems and workflows, APIs, and specialized functions that agents can leverage to perform tasks. These tools allow the agent to interact with the outside world, access real-time data, perform"}, {"title": "3. APPLICATIONS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES", "content": "In this section, we provide an end-to-end agentic system implementation for two major functions in financial services. In particular, we build modeling and model risk management crews and illustrate how these agents collaborate to perform their specialized collective tasks.\nThe financial services industry is highly dependent on accurate modeling procedures for its predictive and decision-making capabilities. We develop the modeling and model risk management crews to illustrate how the agents can collaborate to perform relatively complex functions in an efficient and scalable manner. The goal is to streamline the modeling workflow, carry out model risk management procedures on a trained model, and effectively manage dependencies as well as collaboration among agents.\nThe system architecture for the financial crews, along with the memory property and role-playing, are discussed in \u00a73.1. Agentic workflows for modeling and model risk management crews are discussed in \u00a73.2 and \u00a73.3, respectively. We provide three modeling use cases to highlight the diverse range of tasks that can be accomplished with agentic systems, namely credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling in \u00a73.4. We initialize all agents with GPT-3.5 Turbo from OpenAI as the underlying"}, {"title": "4. FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "We view this paper as a foundational and pragmatic effort to harness the power of agentic systems for tasks relevant to the financial services industry. Looking ahead, research in this area should focus on self-improving agents, a proponent of self-learning, where agents enhance their initial prompts and adapt to roles that weren't initially assigned to them. A good example would be an adaptive learning agent that continuously improve its performance through the interactions it had in the past and the various feedbacks it got. Another area worthy of in-depth investigation is the research and development of crew-generating agentic systems. This could lead to more agile and responsive systems - for example, a crew presented with a prompt to generate its own agents, tools, and tasks required for specific operations such as modeling or model risk management."}]}

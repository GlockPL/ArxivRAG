In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and current limitations.\nOur analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that, while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image analysis techniques. This highlights an underexplored opportunity where advanced image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper insights.\nAdditionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions\u2014key factors for clinical adoption and", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a widely used assisted reproductive technology designed to help individuals and couples overcome infertility [1]. It involves several stages, from ovarian stimulation to oocyte retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer [1-3]. Among these, ovarian stimulation is critical as it ensures the development of multiple oocytes, enhancing the chances of successful fertilization and pregnancy [2,4]. However, the process requires precise management, including the selection of stimulation protocols, hormone dosages, and optimal timing for oocyte retrieval, making it a complex and often subjective task. Figure 1 shows the ovarian stimulation process in IVF, comprising four stages: hormonal medication to stimulate follicles, monitoring follicle growth via ultrasound and hormone levels, follicle puncture for oocyte retrieval, and egg retrieval using ultrasound-guided aspiration to collect mature eggs for fertilization.\nCurrently, ovarian stimulation protocols often follow a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. These protocols rely heavily on clinical guidelines and the subjective judgment of clinicians rather than on personalized, data-driven insights [5,6]. While this approach provides general frameworks for treatment, it fails to account for individual patient characteristics. Consequently, the outcomes of ovarian stimulation can vary significantly, with potential under- or over-responses to stimulation, increasing risks of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) or suboptimal egg retrieval.\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to revolutionize the decision-making process in ovarian stimulation by integrating large datasets and identifying personalized treatment strategies [1,3,7]. Recent studies have explored Al's potential in optimizing hormone dosages, predicting optimal trigger timing for oocyte retrieval, and scheduling ultrasound monitoring [2,4,8\u201317] which used AI for the goals mentioned here]. However, most AI models have primarily relied on clinical data, such as patient demographics, hormonal profiles, and treatment history, with limited incorporation of medical imaging data [2,4,9,11,13,18\u201326]. Ultrasound imaging plays a crucial role in IVF procedures, particularly in assessing ovarian and uterine status [10,16,17,27\u201329]. Before stimulation, pre-stimulation ovarian ultrasounds evaluate baseline ovarian reserves by counting antral follicles (3\u20138 mm in size).

[13], the authors proposed an AI algorithm and assessed its accuracy for the day-to-day decision making during ovarian stimulation compared to evidence-based decisions by the clinical team. Their AI method showed varying accuracy levels for different goals i.e., 0.82 for medication dose adjustments, 0.92 for deciding whether to continue or stop treatment, 0.96 for scheduling or canceling oocyte retrieval and 0.87 for determining the number of days until the next follow-up. Their proposed algorithm was quite accurate in making decisions about whether to continue or stop treatment and whether to trigger egg release or cancel the cycle. However, it wasn't as accurate when deciding on optimal hormonal medication doses as the algorithm was not often able to predict the change in dose when an increase was needed.\nIn the study by Eduardo Hariton et al. [11], the authors designed an AI algorithm to decide the best day to trigger egg retrieval in IVF cycles. When focused on maximizing the number of fertilized eggs, the algorithm recommended triggering 42.3% of the time and waiting 57.7% of the time. Following the algorithm's recommendations resulted in an average gain of 3.015 more fertilized eggs. When the algorithm was adjusted to optimize the number of usable blastocysts (early-stage embryos), it suggested triggering 45.2% of the time and waiting 54.8% of the time. Although their approach led to an average gain of 1.430 more fertilized eggs and 0.577 more total usable blastocysts the algorithm could effectively identify the best trigger day, leading to better outcomes in terms of fertilized eggs and usable blastocysts.\nThe study of Abdel Hameed et al. [10] aimed to develop an Al model to predict oocyte retrieval during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and create user-friendly nomograms to guide gonadotropin protocol and dose decisions.\nMichael Fanton et al. [4] developed interpretable AI models to predict mature (MII) oocyte outcomes if ovulation was induced on the current day versus the following day. Linear regression models aimed to predict MII oocyte, while an estradiol (E2) forecasting model was designed to predict next-day E2 levels, both models using prior follicle counts and E2 data. These models allowed a comparative analysis of MII outcomes between potential trigger days. The average trigger day for ovulation was reported around day 11.8, with patients having an average of 4.5 monitoring visits per cycle. Their model predicting MII oocytes on the trigger day achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.87 oocytes and an $R^2$ of 0.64, while the prediction model for next-day MII outcomes had an MAE of 3.02 oocytes and an $R^2$ of 0.62. For next-day estradiol (E2) levels, the prediction model performed better, with an MAE of 274 pg/mL and an $R^2$ of 0.88. Adding a follicle imputation algorithm improved the model's accuracy slightly, enhancing the MAE by 0.09 oocytes and $R^2$ by 0.02.

[28] explored the use of radiomics features to assess endometrial receptivity (ER) in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). A radiomics score (rad-score) was developed using features extracted from ultrasound images. Five significant radiomics signatures were identified, forming the rad-score which was strongly associated with RPL. The rad-score outperformed traditional predictors like age, spiral artery pulsatility index (SA-PI), and vascularization index (VI) in distinguishing RPL cases. Increased rad-scores (age, SA-PI, and SA-RI) were observed in RPL patients, while VI was lower compared to controls. The study found that rad-scores provide a promising tool for predicting ongoing pregnancy potential in RPL patients, complementing existing ER evaluation methods.\nAnother prospective cohort study performed by Xiaowen Liang et al. [16] evaluated if a multi-modal fusion model combining ultrasound-based deep learning radiomics features and clinical parameters can predict clinical pregnancy outcomes after frozen embryo transfer (FET). The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with the proposed model achieving an AUC of 0.825. Key findings indicated that the multi-modal fusion model outperformed models using either clinical or imaging data alone, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in enhancing predictive accuracy for FET outcomes.\nThe study of J. Fjeldstad et al. [33] explored if an AI-based model is able to predict endometrial receptivity for successful embryo implantation using ultrasound images taken during ovarian stimulation.

Gerard Letterie et al. [13] analyzed follicle growth and maturation using transvaginal ultrasound to support decision making for day-to-day management of ovarian stimulation using AI. In this study, follicle diameters in two dimensions in millimeters (mm) for monitoring visits during the stimulation phase of IVF cycles have been measured.\nWith the aim to investigate whether a ML algorithm can optimize the day of trigger to improve IVF outcomes, Hariton et al. [11] analyzed imaging data such as endometrial thickness gained from transvaginal ultrasound as well as the number of follicles categorized into groups of 5-millimeter (mm) diameter measured at monitoring visits during ovarian stimulation.\nEbid et al. [10] used ultrasound to assess antral follicle development with the aim of creating a validated model for predicting oocyte retrieval outcomes in controlled ovarian stimulation. On the third day of the menstrual cycle, qualified radiographers measured the antral follicles in both ovaries using transvaginal ultrasonography before start of the ovarian stimulation. A follow-up longitudinal assessment of the antral follicle count was also conducted one week after the start of ovarian stimulation to allow adjustments to the gonadotropin dosage.\nFanton et al. [4] analyzed baseline antral follicle count (AFC) from pre-stimulation ultrasound images and follicle sizes measured in monitoring visits during ovarian stimulation. Follicles were categorized into six groups based on their diameter size: <11 mm, 11-13 mm, 14\u201315 mm, 16\u201317 mm, 18\u201319 mm, and >19 mm. They realized that this information could contribute to the development of a ML model for optimizing the day of trigger during ovarian stimulation.\nGerard Letterie et al. [21] included imaging data obtained from ovarian ultrasound during ovarian stimulation. They analyzed the total count of follicles, follicle diameters in two dimensions as the mean value over all follicles as well as outcomes at the time of retrieval including the number of total and mature oocytes, which were categorized into two groups: Group I (0-10 mature oocytes) and Group II (more than 10 mature oocytes). They reported that the information extracted from the follicle diameter combined with Al can support reducing monitoring during ovarian stimulation to a single day and enabling a more balanced scheduling of oocyte retrievals.\nIn Liang et al.'s study [9] a follicle volume biomarker was developed using a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm to calculate the ideal follicle volume for forecasting the number of mature oocytes retrieved and for fine-tuning the timing of the HCG. For this reason, ovarian ultrasound was used to measure the follicle diameters in mm. All ultrasound follicular monitoring was performed using a 3-dimensional (D) ultrasound device with transvaginal volume probe on the day of HCG administration. The authors reported that the proposed follicle volume biomarker combined with AI can efficiently predict the oocyte maturity in the IVF procedures.\nHuang et al. [28] used transvaginal ultrasound data in order to extract radiomics features from ultrasound images of the endometrium to optimize the assessment of endometrial receptivity. The authors reported on the potential of ultrasound radiomics signatures to differentiate between patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and healthy individuals.\nLiang et. al [16] used 2D ultrasound images of the endometrium to create a multi-modal fusion model based on ultrasound-based deep learning radiomics for the evaluation of endometrial receptivity and prediction of pregnancy after FET. The authors highlighted the significantly better performance of the multi-modal fusion model compared to using either images or clinical parameters independently for predicting clinical pregnancy outcomes following FET.\nFanton et al.

[13] included clinical data such as estradiol concentrations in picograms per mm and dose of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone during ovarian stimulation for IVF in addition to the ovarian ultrasound imaging data in their proposed AI methods.\nEduardo Hariton et al. [11] analyzed clinical parameters such as age, body mass index, protocol type and oestradiol level in addition to the uterus ultrasound imaging data. They reported that the total number of follicles with diameter of 16\u201320 mm, the total number of follicles with diameter of 11\u201315 mm, and estradiol level were most important for the high performance of their AI model.\nAlthough Ebid et al. [10] used transvaginal ultrasound to check the development of antral follicles, only clinical data such as women's age, body mass index, concentrations of basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measured on day 2\u20133 of the menstrual cycle, anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels (AMH), the starting and total gonadotropin dose, duration of the stimulation, and type of the stimulation protocol were included in the prediction model. Women's age, basal FSH levels, antral follicular count (AFC), stimulation protocol type, and gonadotropin dose have been identified as significant predictors of oocyte retrieval, with intrinsic factors such as age and ovarian reserve tests (ORTs) including AMH and FSH levels, and AFC, having the greatest influence.\nIn addition to the day-by-day follicle measurements from ultrasound imaging data, clinical parameters such as age, BMI, number of previous IVF cycles, baseline AMH levels, baseline E2 levels and cycle length in days have been included in the study from Fanton et al. [4] with the aim of developing an interpretable machine learning model for optimizing the day of trigger during ovarian stimulation.\nAlong with the follicle measurements from ultrasound imaging Letterie et al. [2] included data obtained both before IVF and during IVF in their study. Pre-IVF data included clinical parameters such as patient age, BMI, smoking history, previous IVF cycles, serum concentrations of AMH and AFC. The data obtained during IVF included protocol type, dose of recombinant FSH, trigger type and estradiol concentrations.\nIn addition to the follicle volume biomarker obtained from 3D ultrasound data, Liang et al. [9] analyzed a dataset of clinical data from previous treatments and infertility assessments, containing the cause and duration of infertility, BMI, hormonal analysis, stimulation type and dosage, type of trigger and number of mature oocytes retrieved.

[16] combined in their study 2D transvaginal ultrasound images, from which they extracted radiomics features, with clinical parameters such as serum hormone concentration, oestradiol, progesterone, LH, testosterone, prolactin and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone.\nWith the aim of predicting endometrial receptivity in recurrent pregnancy loss patients Huang et al. [28] evaluated along with the radiomics features from ultrasound images, clinical data such as age, BMI, number of prior miscarriages, day-3 hormone profile (FSH, LH, and E2) during the natural menstrual cycle, and AMH rate.\nFanton et al. [32] primarily relied on 3D ultrasound imaging data to measure follicle size and counts. These simple imaging-derived features were combined then with clinical data, specifically estradiol levels, to predict the number of retrieved eggs.\nWith the aim of detecting the optimal follicle sizes on TG Hanassab S. et al. [15] included follicle measurements from imaging data, as well as clinical parameters such as fertilization rates, high-quality blastocyst development, live birth rates, age and suppressant protocol.\nTo generate an AI-based endometrial receptivity model Fjeldstad et al.

[13] employed a hybrid algorithm integrating traditional machine learning methods, including classification and regression trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, and neural networks. The algorithm was trained on data from 2,603 IVF cycles (1,853 autologous and 750 donor cycles) comprising 7,376 visits and 59,706 data points. An additional 556 unique cycles were used to validate its performance.\nThe study of Hariton et al. [11] utilized a ML algorithm based on a T-learner meta-algorithm with bagged Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) as base learners. The algorithm analyzed 7,866 IVF cycles to optimize the day of trigger shot administration for improving outcomes like fertilized oocytes (2PNs) and usable blastocysts.\nHameed et al. [10] employed a modified Poisson model with a log-link function to predict oocyte retrieval in a controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) group. The model analyzed data from 636 women undergoing their first in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles. The focus was on advanced traditional ML models to establish dose-response relationships and optimize gonadotropin dosing.\nThe study of Fanton et al. [4] utilized a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model, a non-linear and interpretable machine learning algorithm, to predict individualized gonadotropin starting doses for ovarian stimulation. The algorithm was trained and tested on 18,591 autologous IVF cycles from three U.S.-based clinics. The KNN model identified the 100 most similar patients to a target individual to create personalized dose-response curves predicting metaphase II (MII) oocytes.\nThe study of Letterie et al. [2] used an ensemble model combining multiple ML methods (linear regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, extra trees regression, and XGBoost) to predict key outcomes, including the optimal day for monitoring, trigger day assignment, and the number of retrieved oocytes. The analysis included data from 1,591 autologous IVF cycles across 4,731 visits, with 80% used for training and 20% as a test set.\nXiaowen Liang et al. [9] utilized a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm to establish a novel follicle volume biomarker for predicting oocyte maturity, involving a total of 515 IVF cases. They also used traditional ML algorithms, specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which demonstrated significant accuracy in predicting ovarian hyper-response. The MLP achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.890 and an AUC of 0.880, indicating its effectiveness in individual predictions. Other multivariate classifiers were also assessed, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machines, highlighting the study's comprehensive approach to integrating both deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques in analyzing IVF patient data.\nThe study of Wendi et al. [28] study involved 600 women, including 300 with unexplained RPL and 300 who had full-term pregnancies without prior loss. Significant features were identified using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and logistic regression, and a radiomics score (rad-score) was calculated. The rad-score outperformed conventional ER indicators in identifying RPL patients.\nThe study of Liang X. et al. [16] used a total of 326 patients who underwent frozen FET. They proposed a multi-modal fusion model that combined quantitative clinical parameters (tabular data) with two-dimensional ultrasound images. For image analysis, the study utilized a deep learning architecture based on the VGG-11 network to extract radiomic features from ultrasound images, also focusing on the segmentation of the endometrium to identify regions of interest. It was reported that the multi-modal fusion model outperformed models using either clinical or imaging data alone, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in enhancing predictive accuracy for FET outcomes.\nFanton M, Wenchel S. et al. [32] evaluated the integration of two AI tools for ovarian stimulation: MyCycleClarity, an AI tool for automated follicle counting and measurement from 3D ultrasound images (trained on 91,782 follicles across 19,776 ovaries), and Alife Stim Assist Trigger Tool, a linear regression model predicting the number of eggs retrieved (trained on 26,179 cycles). Data from 553 patients at a single U.S. clinic were analyzed, including 82 cycles with human follicle measurements, 186 cycles with Al measurements, and 25 cycles with both methods. On the day of trigger, MyCycleClarity identified significantly more small follicles (<10mm) compared to manual counting (9.5 vs. 0.8 on average) and a similar number of large follicles (>10mm). The Stim Assist Tool achieved a mean absolute prediction error of 3.30 eggs using AI follicle measurements, compared to 3.84 eggs with human measurements, showing slightly higher accuracy with AI-derived data. The results suggest that MyCycleClarity's improved ability to count small follicles enhances the performance of the Stim Assist Tool, highlighting the synergy between AI tools for more accurate predictions of egg retrieval outcomes in ovarian stimulation.\nThe study from Royo et al.

Single-center studies ensure consistent data collection but are normally limited by smaller sample size and less patient data diversity and thus reduced generalizability.

These studies leveraged tools like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate decision-making processes, setting a precedent for integrating explainable Al (XAI) in reproductive medicine.\nThe study by Fanton et al. [4] prioritized interpretability in ML for optimizing the day of trigger during ovarian stimulation. The researchers employed a linear regression model to predict outcomes such as mature oocytes (MII), fertilized oocytes (2PNs), and usable blastocysts. This model allowed direct interpretability through standardized coefficients, providing clinicians insights into how specific follicle sizes contributed to recommendations. Recursive feature elimination ensured inclusion of the most relevant predictors, enhancing trust in the system's decisions. Unlike black-box models, this approach offered a transparent basis for its predictions, addressing potential clinician concerns and paving the way for broader adoption of AI in assisted reproduction.\nThe study of Hanassab et al. [15] utilized an ensemble-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model to identify optimal follicle sizes on trigger day (TD) for maximizing mature oocytes, high-quality blastocysts, and live birth rates. Explainability was achieved through permutation importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, which identified follicles sized 13-18mm as most influential, with specific importance placed on 15\u201318mm. SHAP provided insights into how follicle sizes contributed to outcomes, while model validation via internal-external testing ensured robustness. The XAI approach supported a personalized, data-driven method for optimizing TD timing, moving beyond traditional reliance on lead follicle size, thereby enhancing clinician trust and potential patient outcomes.\nThe study by Fangfang et al. [14] employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to address explainability in their ML model for predicting reproductive outcomes after FET. SHAP provided both global interpretability, ranking feature importance such as the radiomics score, embryo grade, and endometrial thickness, and local interpretability, offering insights into individual predictions. These methods allowed clinicians to understand how specific features contributed to the model's decisions, bridging the gap between AI-driven insights and clinical trust.

The analyzed studies demonstrate how AI can enhance critical processes, such as hormone dose adjustments, follicular monitoring, and optimal trigger timing. However, a key differentiation of this review with previously reported review papers is its explicit focus on applications where integration of medical imaging data with AI to support ovarian stimulation process assessment, setting it apart from previous reviews like Hariton et al. [8], which broadly examined AI applications in ovarian stimulation without a specific focus on imaging. Moreover, another differentiation of this review from previous ones is its focus on ovarian stimulation phase, which remains less explored in review studies compared to its widespread application in embryo assessment [34\u201336]. While AI combined with imaging is a well-established tool for embryo quality assessment, its use for analyzing ovarian or uterus imaging data before oocyte retrieval is significantly underrepresented, highlighting an important research gap identified by this review study.\nUnlike Hariton et al., which primarily addressed clinical data and hormone optimization, this review underscores the limitations and opportunities of imaging data in IVF. Most of the studies analyzed in this review use imaging, primarily 2D ultrasound, for manual measurements such as follicle diameter and count from ovaries ultrasounds. In addition, a few studies used radiomics feature extraction from segmented endometrium using uterus imaging data. However, advanced imaging techniques and image analysis methods (e.g., 3D ultrasound or deep learning-based image analysis) are underrepresented. This gap represents a significant opportunity for innovation, where novel imaging and deep learning could unlock richer insights into follicular dynamics, endometrial receptivity, and their correlation with IVF outcomes particularly to support ovarian stimulation decision making process.\nAdditionally, imaging has often been relegated to supporting roles, focusing on basic parameters such as follicle size and count rather than leveraging the full potential of information which can be found in imaging data, such as follicle shape and patterns, texture, or volumetric changes.\nThis review also emphasizes the importance of explainable AI (XAI) in clinical settings, a topic that is insufficiently addressed in current literature but is pivotal for clinician trust and adoption. Among the studies analyzed, only three studies [14,15,20] explicitly incorporated XAI techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to provide transparency in decision-making. This enhances the review from Hariton et al., which does not address the explainability challenge in AI models. XAI methodologies are essential to bridge the gap between Al-driven insights and clinician confidence.\nFinally, the predominance of single-center studies and small patient cohorts in current research limits the generalizability of AI applications. Multicenter studies, as seen in the works of Fanton et al. [4] and Hanassab et al. [15], demonstrate the advantages of larger, diverse datasets for building robust and generalizable AI models. This aspect aligns with the broader findings of Hariton et al. but is further contextualized here to emphasize the need for multicenter imaging data integration.\nIn conclusion, while this review reaffirms the transformative role of Al in ovarian stimulation, it uniquely advances the discussion by focusing on medical imaging integration and imaging data used, addressing its current underutilization, and advocating for future advancements in this area future research should explore underrepresented areas, such as applying advanced image analysis techniques to extract knowledge from follicle structure and uterus imaging to broaden the scope of AI applications and enhance outcomes in ovarian stimulation. In addition, explainable AI should be more utilized and diverse patient data from independent centers should be used to enhance explainability and generalizability of the developed AI methods. By addressing these gaps, AI can become a transformative tool, enabling more personalized and effective approaches to IVF treatments."}]}

Media narratives often present events imbued with emotions and moral undertones, influencing how individuals interpret and react to controversial topics. These narratives are composed of events that carry social or moral implications, described using emotionally charged language that triggers specific moral evaluations.\nThe analysis of human behavior requires a multifaceted approach that integrates different dimensions of values, which are \"beliefs\" that guide the interpretation of how individuals evaluate behaviors and events (Schwartz, 1992). Among these, morality stands as a fundamental aspect, critical for understanding behavioral responses, especially in the context of controversial and biased topics. However, relying solely on moral information can be limiting.\nIn fact, morality is often the driving force behind value-based judgments and emotional reactions. Emotions serve as immediate, intuitive responses that can precede rational deliberation, influencing how people interpret events.\nMoreover, events are actions that carry social or moral implications, and indeed they are described by words where the involved entities cause moral and emotional reactions; for example, witnessing an act of injustice can evoke emotions such as anger or empathy, which then shape the moral judgment and interpretation of the event.\nThe aspects of emotions, moralities and events, are deeply interconnected. Their study as concerns controversial arguments like media narratives on legal cases, can be valuable for analyzing human-driven values, since media narratives often frame events in emotionally charged ways, influencing moral evaluations and reinforcing or challenging existing value systems. Despite advancements in AI-based NLP tools like Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a lack of labeled data that jointly captures these three fundamental aspects: events, emotions, and moralities.\nTo face these challenges, we introduce a new semi-automatic dataset for Emotional, Event and Moral Observations in high-impact legal Cases, dubbed E2MoCase, specifically designed to identify events, emotions and moralities in media narratives reporting on legal cases subject to bias.\nOur developed dataset can be used for several NLP tasks based on one or more of its key-constituting dimensions (i.e., moralities, emotions, and events), but also to support related applications, such as bias detection, by training models on E2MoCase to recognize the moral, emotional, and factual characteristics of biased texts. This would be a step toward creating a more equitable landscape for legal and media activities, where the advancements in artificial intelligence can contribute positively to society.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n\u2022 We present E2MoCase, a novel dataset for analyzing emotions, moral values, and events"}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "The current landscape of datasets tends to focus on either emotional analysis, moral reasoning, or event detection separately, with limited exploration of the intersection of these elements.\nSome exploration into integrating these elements can be found in the works of Cherichi and Faiz (2016), who investigated the enhancement of social event detection using big data values, suggesting the potential for integrating various data types, including emotional and moral signals. Heron et al. (2018) provided a dataset specifically designed to capture moral emotions in dyadic interactions, offering a unique perspective on the interplay between moral considerations and emotional states. Gloor (2022) explored methodologies for measuring moral values from facial expressions, indicating a pathway towards the incorporation of these measurements into broader datasets that encompass event detection and moral evaluations. Zlatintsi et al. (2017) proposed COGNIMUSE, a dataset annotated with sensory and semantic saliency, events, cross-media semantics, and emotions, designed for training and evaluating algorithms for event detection, summarization, classification, and emotion tracking in videos. Moreover, the study by Hromic and Hayes (2014) based on constructing Twitter datasets that utilize various signals for event detection, provided insights into handling large-scale data where emotions and moral values are inherently intertwined.\nIn recent years, there has been a wide recognition that comprehensive data sets integrating moral, emotional and event dimensions are needed for effectively analyzing media narratives. As suggested in (Kepplinger et al., 2012), media depictions shape recipients' cognitions, emotions, and opinions, which extend beyond the original frames and are influenced by individual processing. In this regard, Zhang et al. (2024) introduced MORAL-EVENTS, a dataset consisting of structured annotations of moral events across news articles from U.S. media reports, to study how moral values are implicitly conveyed through events rather than explicit moral language. Lei et al. (2024) proposed the EMONA dataset, containing news articles annotated with moral judgments of events to study how these opinions reflect ideological bias and media framing. Li et al. (2016) constructed a corpus of news articles for event-based emotion analysis where event anchor words are used as features for emotion classification.\nThe need for such multi-dimensional frameworks is even more exacerbated when it comes to media narratives that report legal cases. Such narratives are inherently multidimensional, involving not only the factual progression of events but also the emotional responses and moral judgments. Considering all these aspect is essential for training Al models capable of capturing the complexity of how legal issues are framed and perceived in public discourse. To the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset in the literature that answers to the combined need for capturing factual, emotional, and moral dimensions within legal media narratives.\nTo address this gap in the literature, we introduce E2MoCase, a holistic dataset combining emotions, moral values, and events in media narratives reporting on high-impact legal cases. In capturing the complex interplay of emotions, moral values, and events in legal media narratives, E2MoCase provides an unprecedented, comprehensive resource for developing AI models that are sensitive to the multidimensional nature of public discourse on legal matters."}, {"title": "E2MoCase", "content": "E2MoCase is a novel dataset specifically designed to provide a multifaceted lens of legal narratives and press coverage through events, emotions and moral foundations. Figure 1 shows the construction process of E2MoCase, which consists of the following phases: Case selection, which was carried out semi-automatically to identify legal narratives that have attracted extensive media coverage; News retrieval from reputable newspapers concerning the cases selected in the case selection phase; Dataset design and annotation, whereby we automatically annotated news items at paragraph level with values of morality, emotions, and events, employing well-recognized domain-specific LLMs, namely MoralBERT, EmoLLaMA and GoLLIE.\nEventually, each data instance of E2MoCase includes (i) the subject of the case; (ii) the news article's identifier; (iii) the numerical identifier of the paragraph within the article; (iv) the paragraph translated into English (if the original language was different) and (v) its original language, (vi) the numerical scores associated with each of the emotion labels, (vii) the numerical scores associated with each of the morality labels, and (viii) a JSON string for each of the detected events.\nIn the following, we elaborate on each of the three phases performed for the construction of E2MoCase."}, {"title": "Case selection", "content": "We first selected more than 100 candidate cases related to legal matters that had significant media impact due to evidences of cultural biases, such as religious, political, gender, racial and media biases."}, {"title": "News retrieval", "content": "Given the candidate cases, we gathered the corresponding news data through the use of the Swissdox API, which facilitates the retrieval of extensive volumes of Swiss media data for scholarly research.

We believe that paragraphs represent a good balance between input length and semantic coherence preservation, retaining contextual integrity and supporting a fine-grained analysis. Specifically, each paragraph within E2MoCase was annotated with three golden labels, where each label consists of one or more values from each of the following types:\n\u2022 Emotional tone, identifying the presence and intensity of specific emotions in the text: joy, love, optimism, trust, sadness, disgust, pessimism, fear, anticipation, surprise.\n\u2022 Moral trait, which pertains to the underlying morality aspect according to the Moral Foundation Theory considering their dyadic relationship: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation.\n\u2022 Events occurrence, which focuses on the events detected within the paragraph and the subjects involved. Events are defined as specific occurrences at a particular time and place involving one or more participants, providing precise contextual information. In our setting, an event always includes a mention, i.e., a phrase/sentence describing the event. It may also include entities, i.e., the participants involved in the event, and their respective roles.\nThe above annotations were independently performed by using automated tools, as shown in Figure 1, and discussed in detail later in this section."}, {"title": "Emotion detection", "content": "For detecting emotions in news paragraphs, we leveraged EmoLLMs, a series of open-source LLMs for comprehensive affective analysis. EmoLLMs are obtained by fine-tuning various LLMs (bart-large, T5-large, OPT-13B, Bloomz-7b1-mt, LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA2-chat-7B and LLaMA2-chat-13B) on the Affective Analysis Instruction Dataset, an instruction dataset based on the data from SemEval 2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets. Following Mohammad et al. (2018), this dataset is constructed considering five prompt templates, each corresponding to a sentiment-based or emotion-based task, namely: (i) emotion intensity regression (EI-reg), (ii) ordinal classification of emotion intensity (EI-oc), (iii) sentiment regression (V-reg), (iv) ordinal classification of sentiment (V-oc), and (v) emotion classification (E-c). A comprehensive analysis of the performance of EmoLLMs on in-domain and out-domain data indicate that EmoLLMs perform exceptionally well in both regression tasks and classification tasks, surpassing the best model of SemEval 2018 leaderboard and achieving SOTA compared to the other open-source LLMs (Falcon, Vicuna, LLaMA-7B-chat, LLaMA-13B-chat).\nEncouraged by these remarkable results, we opted to use the best-performing EmoLLM from the test set evaluations, i.e., EmoLLaMA-chat-13B, for the E-c task and the EI-reg task. This allowed us to identify a list of detected emotions from the input text (E-c), and to quantify the intensity of each detected emotion (EI-reg). In our experiments, we performed 8-bit quantization on the model, since it significantly reduces the computational requirements, allowing for faster inference times without substantial loss of accuracy."}, {"title": "Moral classification", "content": "We detected the moral values present in the news articles' paragraphs according to the Moral Foundation Theory (MFT).

By following the specific prompt described in GoLLIE for event extraction, we defined the target event encapsulating the guidelines and instructions as docstrings. Specifically, we focused on what we called as Correlation Event, i.e., any dynamics, state change or relationship involving one or more entities. The definition of the Correlation Event and some examples of the extracted events are shown in Appendix D. In our experiments we used Code-LLama with 13B parameters and 8 bit quantization. Note that we also tested InstructUIE for the task of event extraction, which is a fine-tuned version of Flan-T5 with 11B parameters. However, we empirically found out that the results provided by GOLLIE were more accurate and consistent across different paragraphs, i.e., same output format. Note that, in the following, we will use the term \"event\" to intend correlation events."}, {"title": "Analysis of E2MoCase", "content": "News articles collected from SwissDox come from web pages, which may include various events of the day or insertions between paragraphs that are unrelated to the case of interest. To address this issue, we have identified these outliers by leveraging emotional information, and manually filtered out them. The full approach is described in Appendix E.\nTable 1 shows the statistics of E2MoCase with its variants, i.e., E2MoCase containing the paragraphs with no detected events (E2MoCase_noEvents) and E2MoCase with all the paragraphs (E2MoCase_full). We can notice that the event extraction process identified events in only 50,975 paragraphs, resulting in the exclusion of nearly half of the initial paragraphs. We can also observe high variability in the paragraph length in terms of number of tokens (counted using WordPiece tokenizer ) in all the variants; in addition, the average number of detected emotions per paragraph is 1.16 in all cases, whereas the average number of moral values is significantly lower in paragraphs without events compared to those with events. This also indicates that the presence of events, involving actions, decisions or situations, causes a stronger moral response.\nWe further analyze E2MoCase from the perspective of each type of label to gain insights about the underlying media narratives. Figure 2a and 2b show the distribution of emotions and morality traits, respectively. On the one hand, it can be observed that the most frequently detected emotions are anger and disgust, which are also strongly correlated (see Figure 10 in Appendix F). On the other hand, the distribution of moral values is much more balanced, with a predominance of cheating, subversion, and betrayal values, which are also strongly correlated (see Figure 9 in Appendix F). From Figure 3, we observe that cheating, betrayal, subversion and degradation moral values show a significant positive correlation with emotions such as anger and disgust. This suggests that narratives involving negative moral values are likely to evoke strong negative emotions and vice versa. Additionally, when considering moral values like purity, fairness and care, we also observe a slight positive correlation with negative emotions such as anger and disgust. This counter-intuitive finding may indicate that media narrative arousing these positive moral values are perceived as particularly sensational, thereby eliciting strong negative emotional responses. Nonetheless, as depicted in Figure 4, the events behind the news selected for E2MoCase, are quite controversial such as murder, shoot, rape. This is expected given the topics covered by the collected news articles. Additionally, we observed that in the paragraphs lacking any emotions or moral dimensions, which are approximately 3% of the total, the associated events include actions like buy, sign, submit, announce, move, win, and increase (see Figure 12 in Appendix F). It is likely that these events do not evoke strong moral or emotional responses because they are often perceived as routine or neutral actions, devoid of inherent effective implications.\nSummary. The analysis of E2MoCase reveals that the event extraction process identified events in 50,975 paragraphs, excluding nearly half of the initial paragraphs (i.e., E2MoCase_full). Paragraphs show high variability in length, with an average of 1.16 detected emotions and an average number of moral values significantly lower in paragraphs without events compared to those with events. There is an imbalance in the distribution of emotions, with negative emotions being more prevalent, while moral values are more evenly distributed. Negative emotions, particularly anger and disgust, frequently co-occur and are strongly associated with negative moral values such as cheating, betrayal, subversion, and degradation. Additionally, events depicted in E2MoCase, like murder and rape, align with the dataset's focus on controversial legal cases, explaining the prevalence of intense moral and emotional responses."}, {"title": "Validation of E2MoCase", "content": "Since the emotions, moralities, and events in E2MoCase have been obtained automatically (i.e., through MoralBERT, EmoLLaMA, GoLLIE), it is essential to provide some guarantee of the reliability of these labels. To this purpose, our approach was to train models on E2MoCase for tasks of moral value detection and emotion detection in order to validate the test performances on each of the three dimensions separately."}, {"title": "Validation of moral labels", "content": "Considering the moral dimensions, we examined the validity of the labels in E2MoCase for detecting moral values in human-annotated texts. Specifically, we fine-tuned a BERT base model (bert-base-uncased) on E2MoCase for morality classification and assessed the model's performance on two state-of-the-art datasets for moral values classification, based on the Moral Foundation Theory:\n\u2022 Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC): a collection of 16,123 manually annotated Reddit comments, extracted from morally-relevant subreddits about US and French politics, and everyday moral life. Note that the morality annotations in MFRC is intended without the virtue-vice separation (e.g., Care/Harm is a unique label).\n\u2022 Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (MFTC): a corpus of 35,108 manually annotated tweets from several domains discussing morally-relevant and popular topics, such as Black Lives Matter, Hurricane Sandy, MeToo movement.\nWe considered the task of moral value classification in a multi-label setting. We binarized the MoralBERT-based numerical scores associated with morality values in E2MoCase (i.e., scores equal to or greater than 0.5 were mapped to 1, otherwise to 0). We performed a K-Fold cross-validation strategy, with K = 5. Following other works, for the MFTC dataset we adopted the common approach of reducing the moral labels to 5, without distinguishing between virtues and vices. The fine-tuning was conducted for 5 epochs with a batch size of 8, using the Adam optimizer, and a learning rate of 5e-5.\nIn Table 2, we compare the results on MFRC and MFTC test sets obtained by BERT trained on E2MoCase (dubbed BERTE2Mo), BERT trained on MFTC (BERT MFTC) and BERT trained MFRC (BERTMFRC), under the same settings described above. We report the mean F1 score for each moral label, along with an overall evaluation of morality detection using the averaged micro F1 score (overall F1). Bold values, resp. underlined values, correspond to the best. resp. the second-best, results for each moral value (analogous remarks holds for the subsequent tables).\nAs expected, the in-domain models, i.e. models trained and tested on the same dataset, generally achieve the best performance. More interestingly, in most cases BERTE2Mo outperforms its out-of-domain counterparts (i.e., BERTMTFC for MFRC and BERT MFRC for MFTC), which are trained on human-annotated labels. In few cases, BERTE2Mo even outperforms the in-domain models (e.g., for the Loyalty label in the MFRC dataset).\nBased on the above results, there is a basis for asserting that the morality labels of E2MoCase are consistent with human judgment, given that the model trained on these labels performs sufficiently well in detecting human-provided labels.\nIn addition, Figure 13 in the Appendix F provides further evidence on the validity of the moral labels of E2MoCase, showing that: (i) texts with the same label are sufficiently similar to each other and distinct from texts with different labels, and (ii) the labeling patterns across E2MoCase, MFRC, and MFTC datasets are consistent to each other."}, {"title": "Validation of emotion labels", "content": "Similarly, we tested the validity of the emotion labels of E2MoCase. In this case, we used the data from as a comparison, for two main reasons: the emotion labels in this dataset are human-annotated and correspond to those of E2MoCase. As described in Section 3.3, the aim of Mohammad et al. (2018) is to evaluate various computational methods for detecting affective states, such as emotions and sentiments, expressed in tweets. We employ the data designed for emotion classification (E-c) task, hereinafter referred to as SemEval, containing about 11k instances. However, looking at Figure 2a, we observe that the labels trust, surprise, love and pessimism are almost absent in E2MoCase. Since it would not be possible to validate E2MoCase on these labels, we excluded them from the validation process and fine-tuned a BERT-base-uncased model on both E2MoCase and SemEval for the remaining labels (anger, disgust, fear, joy, optimism, sadness). We employed the same training settings as previously described for morality classification.

These three aspects are pivotal for understanding how media biases shape public perception of social and legal issues. While the dataset was labeled using automatic procedures based on well-recognized domain-specific LLMs, our validation methodology showed that E2MoCase enables NLP tools to achieve competitive performance on human annotated datasets.\nFuture work will focus on expanding the dataset to include a wider array of sources and languages, increasing the robustness of the analysis. In particular, it would be interesting to link the retrieved news with official legal documents of the associated legal trials. We also aim to refine the tools used to detect events and classify emotional and moral content, thereby improving the precision with which biases can be identified."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Besides recognizing the need for a more robust validation process support on human annotators, as well as the opportunity for maintaining E2MoCase with fresh news from SwissDox or other similar reliable sources, one further limitation is the linguistic scope. Currently, the collection only contains articles translated into English, which may result in the loss of complex meanings found in the original language versions. This may affect annotations of emotions and moral qualities, particularly in languages where cultural factors heavily influence emotional expression and moral interpretation. We emphasize that the original paragraphs of E2MoCase cover different languages, such as French, German and Italian.\nAlso, cross-cultural analysis of moral and emotional representations is another area that requires further exploration. The same legal case may evoke different moral and emotional responses in different countries due to cultural and social differences. Cross-cultural studies, such as retrieving news of a case from different countries' media, could provide insights into these differences, increasing the dataset's applicability and impact in global research contexts and providing a broader spectrum of media representations of legal narratives."}]}

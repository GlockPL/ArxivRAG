Introduction", "content": "The world is inundated with lots of information and new information is produced from time to time. As a result, how to appropriately combine information from complex sources has drawn a lot of attention. Researchers around the world have put considerable efforts in extracting truly valuable part of information and relative theories have been proposed to satisfy the urgent need. The representatives of them are maximum theories [1-3], fuzzy theory [4\u20139], complex mass function [10\u201314], soft theory [15\u201318], Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and its extension [19\u201324], Z-numbers [25\u201328] and D numbers [29\u201332]. For these theories, they all try to solve the problem that how to obtain effective and clear judgments from uncertain and intricate information and different methods are offered based on them. Because of the effectiveness of these theories, they are also be utilized in many applications, like pattern recognition [33\u201336], risk evaluation [37\u201341], decision making [42\u201346] and some other applications [47\u201349]. Among them, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) is a powerful tool in managing uncertain information and multi-source information fusion. Currently, the various methods for multi-sensor information fusion based on evidence theory are broadly divided into two categories. The first category mainly utilizes the entropy weight method to weigh the evidence to be fused. Specifically, in evidence theory, different pieces of evidence (or information sources) may contribute differently to the decision-making process [50\u201352]. The entropy weight method evaluates the importance or reliability of each piece of evidence by calculating its entropy value. Evidence with lower entropy values (i.e., greater information variability) is considered more informative and thus is given greater weight in the fusion process. The entropy weight method provides an objective method of assigning weights to different pieces of evidence based on their information content [53, 54]. This is crucial in evidence theory, as subjective judgment can lead to bias. Furthermore, in cases of evidence conflict, the entropy weight method helps prioritize more likely reliable evidence, thereby reducing the impact of less reliable conflicting information. In summary, the role of the entropy weight method in information fusion in evidence theory lies in its systematic and objective approach to assess and integrate multiple pieces of evidence, especially under conditions characterized by uncertainty and incomplete information, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the decision-making process.\nThe second category involves using different credibility distances to measure the similarity between pieces of evidence, followed by a fusion process based on similarity [55\u201357]. Evidence distance is used to measure and compare the differences and consistencies between different sources of evidence, where smaller distances indicate greater consistency between the evidence, and larger distances indicate greater inconsistency. In evidence theory, conflict between evidence is a very important research focus. During the fusion process, if the distance between two sources of evidence is large, it indicates that they may have significant conflict. By identifying and analyzing these conflicts, inconsistencies in information fusion can be more effectively addressed and resolved [58, 59]. This can also improve the accuracy and reliability of information fusion. The fusion process can generate more comprehensive and credible conclusions based on considering the uniqueness and differences of each piece of evidence. For decision support systems, considering the distance between pieces of evidence can help decision-makers better understand the relationships and reliability of different information sources, thereby making wiser decisions. However, both methods are not without flaws. For example, the entropy weight method mainly considers the variability of each indicator when calculating weights,"}, {"title": null, "content": "but it does not consider the correlation between data. This may lead to the neglect of some important information, especially when there is a high correlation between indicators. The method of using distance for evidence fusion can lead to unstable or inaccurate results when there is very high conflict between the evidence. In extreme cases, these conflicts can cause the fusion process to fail.\nTo solve these problems, this paper proposes solutions from two aspects. We separate the conflicting parts in evidence fusion and calculate the corresponding uncertainty for each piece of evidence to determine the weight between the evidence, addressing potential extreme conflicts in evidence fusion. To further enhance the reliability of evidence fusion, we refer to the concept of Z-number, constructing a Z-number-like structure for each piece of evidence to improve overall credibility. Then, we use the pignistic transformation to resolve the uncertainty of the evidence and innovatively propose the use of OWA operators to fuse the constructed Z-numbers, obtaining the corresponding credibility value for each proposition. Finally, using the traditional Dempster combination rule, the processed evidence is fused to obtain the credibility assignment for each proposition. In sum, the method proposed in this paper takes advantage of DSET and could produces much more accurate and reasonable results by redesigning the process of combination of information. And the main contribution of the method can be listed as:\n1. A reliability measure system is introduced into the process of combination so as to make clear the level of priority of information sources.\n2. By utilizing a counter-standardized rule of obtaining conflicting part, a consistency in results between traditional Dempster combination rule and proposed method is achieved.\n3. A concise aggregation of information is satisfied by taking advantage of the concept of OWA which ensures completeness of information processed.\n4. A much better and clearer performance in generating final judgments can be realized which defeats traditional and some modern methods under different circumstances.\nAnd the rest of this paper is written as follows.

Obtain conflicting part of evidences", "content": "The Yager fusion rule is a method used for information fusion in evidence theory (Dempster-Shafer theory). Proposed by Ronald R. Yager, it aims to address issues that may arise with Dempster combination rule when dealing with highly conflicting evidence. By allocating the impact of conflicting evidence to a specific \"uncertainty\u201d category, the results of the Yager fusion rule are typically more intuitive and easier to understand. This assists users in better interpreting and comprehending the fusion outcomes. Compared to some other fusion methods, the Yager rule is able to preserve more of the original information during the fusion process, which can be very important for subsequent analysis and decision-making. Taking advantage of Yager's rule of combination, a simplified rule to obtain conflicting part is designed. First, combine evidences utilizing traditional Dempster combination rule without a step of normalization to avoid to exaggerate underlying mistaken effects due to highly conflicting phenomenon but remain consistent with traditional solution in combination as far as possible. Then, collect undistributed part of mass contained in BPA as the part indicating conflicts. The process can be defined as:\n$\\xi(P_i) = \\sum_{I_r \\cap O_t \\cap P_y \\cap...=P_i} \\xi_1(I_r) * \\xi_2(O_t) * \\xi_3(P_y) *...$                                                               (18)\n$\\xi(X) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi(P_i)^C$ (19)\nThis operation remains a basic ability in indicating underlying target benefiting from Yager's method. In the Dempster combination rule, there is a requirement for the normalization of probabilities, which can pose issues when faced with highly conflicting evidence.

The dual-structure approach aligns closely with natural human expression and understanding of uncertainty, making Z-numbers particularly useful in decision-making scenarios where precise data may not be available or the information is subjective. Their adaptability across various domains, from engineering to social sciences, stems from their ability to model different types of uncertainties, extending the capabilities of fuzzy logic with an added layer of reliability information. This makes Z-numbers especially valuable in complex environments and risk assessment, where they provide a nuanced understanding of uncertainty, addressing the limitations of traditional numerical data in capturing the intricacies of real-world information. Besides, Deng entropy is widely used to measure degree of uncertainty, so the opposite of it is introduced into the credibility measure, which remains consistent with the concept of Z-number.

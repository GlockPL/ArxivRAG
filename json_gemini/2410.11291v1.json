However, such models require an ever-larger text corpus to train them [1]. NLP researches are basically\ndependent on resources such as the datatset. Low-resource languages, such as Assamese, face this challenge ever\nso often [2]. Thus, a centralized open-source repository of the Assamese dataset would help a community of NLP\nresearchers and enthusiasts alike to participate in maintaining or upgrading the dataset.\nAssamese language is the official language of Assam, a north-eastern state of India, with home to approximately 15\nmillion native speakers. It is one of the scheduled languages of India. A variety of experiments and researchers are\nbeing conducted in the Assamese language. With the growing interest in research in this field, comes the requirement\nfor datasets. Various datasets has been used to facilitate such research works, few standard but mostly nonstandard\ndatasets are used for the tasks [2].\nThrough our research, we propose a central repository of datasets for the Assamese language curated for the NMT\nResearch purposes."}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": "C. J. Kumar and S. K. Kalita (2016) developed a comprehensive dataset aimed at enhancing research in Optical\nCharacter Recognition (OCR) for the Assamese script. They created a novel offline dataset that includes a wide range\nof both modern and historical Assamese documents, encompassing machine-printed, handwritten, and degraded texts.\nThe dataset was meticulously collected from various sources, ensuring a broad representation of Assamese language\nvariations. Their paper also addressed the challenges inherent in recognizing Assamese characters, particularly in\ndegraded and historical documents. By introducing the dataset, the authors aimed to support and drive further research\nin Assamese OCR, facilitating the sustainability of the language in the digital era [3].\nK. Talukdar and S. K. Sarma (2024), in their study, developed a Universal Parts of Speech (UPoS) tagged dataset\nfor the Assamese language, which was crucial for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI research in\nlow-resource languages. They created a dataset comprising 283,506 tokens across 20,280 sentences by mapping the\nBIS tagset to the UPoS tagset. After rigorous linguistic validation, their dataset served as a gold standard resource for\nAssamese, supporting various NLP tasks and enabling the training of machine learning models for the language [2].\nD. Pathak et al. (2022), in their study, developed a named entity recognition (NER) dataset for the Assamese language.\nTheir dataset consisted of around 99,000 tokens, including text from political speeches and Assamese plays. They\nbenchmarked this dataset using various state-of-the-art NER models, achieving an 80.69% F1-score with the MuRIL\nmodel. The annotated dataset and top-performing models were made publicly available to support further research in\nAssamese NLP [4].\nP. Chowdhury et al. (2023) developed an acoustic/prosodic feature-based audio dataset specifically for Assamese speech\nsummarization. They focused on extracting prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and sentence duration to aid in\nsummarizing spoken Assamese content. The dataset was designed to support the development and evaluation of speech\nsummarization models. The authors also planned to expand the dataset by adding manual transcripts and incorporating\nadditional prosodic elements like intonation to enhance the accuracy of the summarization models [5].\nU. Baruah and S. M. Hazarika (2014) introduced a novel dataset of online handwritten Assamese characters, collected\nfrom various contributors using digitizers. Their dataset comprised of 8,235 samples covering numerals, basic\nalphabetic characters, and conjunct consonants. They detail the data acquisition process, which involved recording\npen-tip movements and switching states, and evaluate preliminary classification results using support vector machines\n(SVMs) with different kernels. They explored three feature sets to assess classification accuracy, achieving a 99.11%\naccuracy for numerals and 81.15% for alphabetic characters with specific SVM kernels. Their dataset is the first publicly\navailable resource for online handwritten Assamese characters, intended to support further research in handwriting\nrecognition for this script [6].\nP. Choudhury et al. (2024) explored Automatic Image Captioning (AIC) for the low-resource Assamese language in\ntheir study. They examined two distinct approaches: one that used an English-pretrained model to generate English\ncaptions, which were then translated into Assamese, and another that trained a model directly on an Assamese image-\ncaption dataset. Their research evaluated the performance of these approaches using both LSTM and transformer\narchitectures. Their findings indicated that models trained specifically on Assamese data outperformed those relying on\nEnglish-to-Assamese translation. The study demonstrated the superior efficacy of language-specific training for image\ncaptioning in low-resource languages [7].\nDas and Singh (2024) examined sentiment analysis for the Assamese language, a resource-constrained language despite\nits official status in India. Their study utilized various lexical features from Assamese news texts and applied both\nmachine learning and deep learning techniques. They found that combining AAV lexical features with an XGBoost\nclassifier achieved the highest accuracy of 86.76% using the TF-IDF approach. Their findings highlight that integrating\nlexical features with machine learning models significantly enhances sentiment prediction, particularly in scenarios\nwith small datasets [8].\nS. Sarma and N. Pathak (2023) proposed a design for an AI chatbot capable of understanding Assamese using a\nfeedforward neural network (FFNN). They developed an Assamese language dataset and trained the model utilizing\nthe bag-of-words method for feature extraction. The model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1\nscore, achieving an accuracy of 89.11%, which surpassed traditional SVM and Naive Bayes models. Their research\nintroduced a deep-learning FFNN model for an Assamese chatbot and provided future research directions. This study is\nnotable for its contribution to the AI Assamese chatbot domain, offering potential advancements for digital language\nuse and inspiring further research [9]."}, {"title": "3 Dataset Collection", "content": "The datasets are divided into two types, pre-training corpora and post-training corpora. As the name suggests, pre-\ntraining corpora are to be used to train the NMT Models for the pre-training steps; Similarly, the post-training corpora\nare to be used, though not limited to, for the fine-tuning of the NMT Models.\nAs mentioned in table 1, tentative 4 pre-training corpora and 5 post-training corpora exist in the repository."}, {"title": "4 Usage and Applications", "content": "The centralized dataset repository for the Assamese language presents a broad spectrum of usage and applications,\nprimarily in the domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Translation, and AI-driven linguistic research.\nOne of the primary applications is in the development and refinement of Large Language Models (LLMs) specific to\nAssamese, which can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of tasks such as machine translation, sentiment\nanalysis, and named entity recognition (NER). Researchers can leverage these datasets for training deep learning models,\nthereby enabling more sophisticated AI systems capable of understanding and generating text in Assamese.\nMoreover, the repository can be utilized for developing domain-specific applications such as Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) systems, which are essential for digitizing historical and contemporary Assamese documents.\nThis can facilitate the preservation of Assamese literary and cultural heritage in the digital age. The dataset is also\ninstrumental in creating chatbots and virtual assistants that communicate in Assamese, thereby expanding the reach of\ndigital services to Assamese speakers.\nEducational institutions and linguists can use the repository for language teaching tools and automatic grading\nsystems that can evaluate Assamese text with higher precision. Additionally, the dataset can support sentiment\nanalysis applications for monitoring and analyzing public opinion in Assamese news and social media, aiding in better\nunderstanding societal trends."}, {"title": "5 Challenges and Limitations", "content": "Despite the promising prospects, there are several challenges and limitations associated with the creation and utilization\nof a centralized Assamese dataset repository. One of the primary challenges is the inherent scarcity of high-quality,\nannotated Assamese text data, which limits the ability to train robust NLP models. The lack of standardized datasets\nposes difficulties in ensuring consistency across different research projects, making it challenging to compare results or\nreplicate studies.\nAnother significant challenge is the diversity within the Assamese language itself, which includes various dialects and\nscripts. This linguistic variability can complicate dataset collection, annotation, and model training, as models may\nstruggle to generalize across different forms of Assamese.\nThe availability of computational resources also poses a limitation, particularly for researchers and institutions with\nlimited access to high-performance computing infrastructure. Training LLMs and other complex models on large\ndatasets requires substantial computational power, which may not be readily available in low-resource settings.\nFurthermore, there are ethical considerations related to data privacy and consent, especially when dealing with sensitive\nor personally identifiable information in the datasets. Ensuring the ethical use of data and protecting the privacy of\nindividuals whose data may be included in the corpus is a critical concern that must be addressed.\nFinally, there is the challenge of maintaining and updating the dataset repository. As the Assamese language continues\nto evolve, and as new data sources become available, the repository will need to be regularly updated to remain relevant\nand useful. This requires ongoing collaboration and support from the research community and other stakeholders."}, {"title": "6 Discussion", "content": "The development of a centralized dataset repository for the Assamese language is a crucial step towards advancing NLP\nresearch and AI applications for low-resource languages. This initiative addresses a critical gap in the availability of\nstandardized, high-quality datasets, which are essential for training effective models in the Assamese language. By\nproviding a curated and accessible repository, the research community can foster greater collaboration and innovation\nin Assamese NLP.\nHowever, the challenges and limitations outlined in Section 5 highlight the need for a strategic approach to dataset\ncollection, annotation, and maintenance. It is essential to develop methodologies that can efficiently capture the\nlinguistic diversity of Assamese while ensuring data quality and consistency. The role of community-driven efforts\ncannot be overstated, as a collective approach can help mitigate some of the resource constraints and ensure the\nsustainability of the repository.\nThe discussion also extends to the ethical implications of dataset usage. Researchers must be mindful of the privacy\nconcerns and ethical considerations associated with the data, especially when deploying models in real-world applica-\ntions. Transparency in data usage and adherence to ethical standards will be critical in gaining public trust and ensuring\nthe responsible use of AI technologies in the Assamese language context.\nLooking forward, the repository could serve as a model for similar initiatives in other low-resource languages, promoting\nlinguistic diversity and inclusivity in the global NLP landscape. By building robust and accessible datasets, we can help\nensure that all languages, regardless of their resource status, are represented in the digital age."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "In conclusion, the introduction of a centralized dataset repository for the Assamese language marks a significant\nmilestone in the field of NLP and AI research.

Platforms like Illumina's next-generation sequencing (NGS) are used to\nproduce the raw data for this experimental procedure. This raw FASTQ data must then be prepared via\na complex series of data manipulations by bioinformaticians. This process currently takes place on an\nunwieldy textual user interface like a terminal/command line that requires the user to install and import\nmultiple program packages, preventing the untrained biologist from initiating data analysis. Open-\nsource platforms like Galaxy have produced a more user-friendly pipeline, yet the visual interface\nremains cluttered and highly technical, remaining uninviting for the natural scientist. To address\nthis, SeqMate is a user-friendly tool that allows for one-click analytics by utilizing the power of a\nlarge language model (LLM) to automate both data preparation and analysis (differential expression,\ntrajectory analysis, etc). Furthermore, by utilizing the power of generative AI, SeqMate is also capable\nof analyzing such findings and producing written reports of upregulated/downregulated/user-prompted\ngenes with sources cited from known repositories like PubMed, PDB, and Uniprot.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Processing RNA-seq data is tedious.

Many advances in process automation, especially utilizing the technological\nboom in generative AI and large language models, have not been implemented in the bioinformatics space. SeqMate is\nlooking to change that by utilizing an accountable (cites sources and actively prompted against hallucinations) LLM\nthat automates bioinformatic analysis like trajectory analysis, differential expression, and more. Currently, the tool is\ndesigned and tested for differential expression starting with raw FASTQ data, but SeqMate is envisioned as a suite of\nmultiple bioinformatic processes that provides a one-click option for the untrained biologist to spearhead data analysis."}, {"title": "RNA Sequencing: A Brief Biological Context", "content": "RNA sequencing involves high-throughput sequencing of RNA nucleic acid sequences and amounts. RNA-seq has led\nto many scientific advances, such as identifying regulatory regions, biomarkers, and mutations [2]. Within the family\nof RNA sequencing exist two distinct processes, bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing. Bulk RNA\nsequencing allows a researcher to look at the transcriptome of a sample/tissue, commonly by using NGS technology\nlike the Illumina sequencing platform. Single-cell seq differs in that instead of looking at the transcriptome of an entire\ntissue, one can analyze the transcriptome of an individual cell by using microfluidics to separate individual cells and\nbarcoding the RNA of each cell with unique identifiers, allowing researchers to identify the genetic activity of various"}, {"title": "Role of Bioinformatics in RNA Sequencing", "content": "RNA-seq is a powerful high throughput sequencing tool that can produce large amounts of data, yet there is still a large\namount of tedious data processing that remains before meaningful insights can be gleaned. To delineate, the traditional\nbioinformatics process from raw RNA-seq data looks like the following:\n\n1. Perform quality control.\n2. Cut adapter regions and align with reference genome.\n3. Perform file conversion and produce count matrices.\n4. Normalize counts.\n5. Perform differential expression analysis.\n6. Relate upregulation/downregulation findings with relevant biological pathways.\n7. Create write-ups/visuals.\n\nAfter such analysis, one can meaningfully interpret and extrapolate the results of RNA-seq to their experimental design\n[7]."}, {"title": "Current Limitations of Bioinformatics Suites", "content": "Currently, bioinformatics analysis involves knowledgeable professionals running various open-source packages on some\nform of textual user interface (command line/terminal). Conducting such analysis involves importing/downloading the\ncorrect packages, uploading the data, running the correct commands, and downloading the processed data to the right\nlocation for every step of a multi-step process that takes place in a lay-person unfriendly environment. This cryptic\nprocess obfuscates natural scientists like cellular biologists from conducting their own analysis and bottlenecks the\nscientific process. Open-source platform Galaxy has made a bioinformatics analysis pipeline, but its usability is limited\nby a confusing visual interface. While Galaxy has created a powerful tool that streamlines bioinformatics for the trained\nspecialist, it is still too complex and technical to be quickly intuitive for the biologist. Additionally, the pipelines Galaxy\nprovides are generic and do not cater to specific use cases, instead serving as general guides [1]."}, {"title": "Our Approach", "content": "In our goal to automate the process of RNA Sequencing, we aimed to create an autonomous system that was capable\nof receiving user input, running the appropriate intermediate steps (generating genome indices, creating appropriate\nmetadata for differential expression analysis, filtering genome indices, etc.), and providing an output. For this particular\nuse case, we decided that the user input would be a series of FASTQ files, the appropriate genome, thresholds for log\nfold change and p-value, specification of control and experimental FASTQ files, and the output would be a series of\ngenes demonstrating greatest differential expression based on user-defined thresholds (log fold change and p-value) and\ndetailed information about them.\n\nSuch a system would require a \"logical driver\" that conducts decision-making (picking the appropriate files either\nfrom the user or from generated files in other steps of the intermediate process, running the appropriate code/terminal\ncommands in an environment, generating graphs, providing narration, etc.). We chose to use a large language model to\nbe this component of our system due to their ability to understand data through insight generation.\n\nHowever, vanilla LLMs have two main challenges. First, they are worse at solving complex reasoning problems\nthat require decision making at intermediate steps compared to simple, single-step tasks [5]. Additionally, they lack\nadditional functionalities necessary within this system, such as the ability to run open-source libraries on native\nenvironments as well as search online databases/browsers (such as the NCBI GenBank Database and Ensembl).\nTherefore, we couple the large language model with a variety of external tools that enable the aforementioned tasks,\nthus creating an LLM agent. Furthermore, we make this agent using the open-source package LangChain. LangChain"}, {"title": "Limitations and Future Work", "content": "Due to intrinsic noise that exists in training data, LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations where they produce factually\nincorrect results. Though our prompt engineering limits this through one-shot/zero-shot prompts, the pipeline sometimes\ngenerates inaccurate results. We hope to generate statistics for hallucinations (frequency, type, etc.) in a follow-up\nreport.\n\nAdditionally, generating a genome index through hisat is currently computationally expensive. However, this should\nnot be an issue when the pipeline is run on a desktop or server.\n\nMoreover, for the LLM in the system, we currently rely on OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 model. This may pose a\nprivacy concern, as aspects of the data supplied to the agent are sent to OpenAI through an API. In the future, we would\nlike to experiment with open-source LLMs that can be ran locally.\n\nIt is also important to create a graphical user interface for users to interact with the LLM agent, and we also plan on\nextrapolating our pipeline to other bioinformatics processes."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In summary, SeqMate is an automated pipeline that simplifies RNA-seq data processing and analysis built for the natural\nscientist. Unlike traditional \"pipelines\" existing bioinformatics suites provide, SeqMate is custom to every use-case by\nleveraging a large language model agent. In the future, SeqMate looks to expand the pipeline to include other analytical\nmethods following the same user-friendly design policy."}]}

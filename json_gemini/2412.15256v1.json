{"title": "Structured Extraction of Real World Medical Knowledge using LLMs for Summarization and Search", "authors": ["Edward Kim", "Manil Shrestha", "Richard Foty", "Tom DeLay", "Vicki Seyfert-Margolis"], "abstract": "Creation and curation of knowledge graphs at scale can be used to exponentially accelerate the discovery, matching, and analysis of diseases in real-world data. While disease ontologies are useful for annotation, integration, and analysis of biological data, codified disease and procedure categories e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT, etc. rarely capture all of the nuances in a patient condition or, in the case of rare disease, may not even exist. Furthermore, there are multiple disease definitions used in data sources and publications, each having its own structure and hierarchy. Mapping between ontologies, finding disease clusters, and building a representation of the chosen disease area are resource-intensive, often requiring significant human capital. We propose the creation and curation of a patient knowledge graph utilizing large language model extraction techniques. In order to expand in volume and scale, knowledge graphs with generalized language capability allow for data to be extracted using natural language rather than being constrained by the exact terminology or hierarchy of existing ontologies. We develop a method of mapping back to existing ontologies such as MeSH, SNOMED-CT, RXNORM, HPO, etc. to ground the extracted entities to known entities in the medical community.\nWe have access to one of the largest ambulatory care EHR databases in the country. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we benchmark our extraction in a test set with over 33.6M unique patients, in the area of patient search. In this case study, we perform a patient search for a rare disease: Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome was codified as an ICD10 recognizable disease in October 2020. In the following research, we describe our method of the construction of patient-specific knowledge graphs and subsequent searches for patients who exhibit symptoms of a particular disease. Using patients with confirmed ICD10 codes for Dravet syndrome as our ground truth, we utilize our LLM-based entity extraction techniques and formalize an algorithmic way of characterizing patients in a grounded ontology to assist in mapping patients to specific diseases. Finally, we present the results of a real-world discovery method on Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), identifying patients with a rare disease, where no ground truth currently exists.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Knowledge graphs, as directed labeled graphs that model entities and their relationships, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating heterogeneous data sources into a unified, semantically rich representation that enables complex reasoning and inference tasks across domains [1]\u2013[3].\nGiven the current and ever-expanding capabilities of the auto-regressive transformer architectures, we hypothesize that Knowledge Graph (KG)-enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) will be ground-breaking for clinical research study design and development. The ability to extract data from pub- lished literature, clinical trial databases, anonymized patient medical records, and reported outcomes data will provide an enormous benefit in accelerating clinical study design. For example, analyzing patient inclusion criteria and endpoint measures across multiple disease studies could reveal which outcome measures proved most effective in specific clinical contexts. Importantly, this approach enables comparison be- tween real-world effectiveness, derived from medical records, and reported outcomes in published literature across multiple studies of the same disease.\nWhile AI can efficiently analyze vast amounts of scientific information, it is important to represent data in common data terminology and formats that enable linkable, shareable knowledge, which in turn, enable critical evaluation and reveal conceptual relationships. Knowledge graphs address these limitations by providing a framework for data representation, integration, and visualization that facilitates the identification of complex relationships across multiple data sources.\nTechnical challenges in KG implementation include embed- dings, acquisition, completion, fusion, and reasoning [4]. The process of deriving knowledge from unstructured data, partic- ularly medical text, is complicated by linguistic nuances and context-dependent meanings. Entity disambiguation presents additional complexity, especially when dealing with similar or identical names in different contexts. As highlighted in industry practices, successful semantic KG creation depends heavily on data harmonization across sources, though this is often hindered by inconsistent naming conventions and data heterogeneity across varying formats and standards [2], [3].\nIn this work, we propose the development of patient knowl- edge graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing large language model extraction techniques. This approach enables data extraction via natural language, overcoming lim- itations of translation between medical notes to standardized ontologies. We present qualitative and quantitative results on several benchmark datasets as well as demonstrate a real- world case study on the mapping and discovery of two rare neurodegenerative diseases, Dravet Syndrome and BPAN."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "Knowledge graphs have become increasingly important in the medical domain, particularly for integrating heterogeneous data sources and enabling cross-domain knowledge discov- ery. Traditionally, biomedical knowledge organizations relied heavily on manual curation by domain experts, a process that was time-consuming and expensive. Foundational resources include the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [5], a comprehensive meta thesaurus of biomedical terminology, and Gene Ontology (GO) [6], which provides a structured vocab- ulary for gene and protein functions across species. Building upon these terminological frameworks, specialized biomedical knowledge graphs emerged, such as DisGeNET [7], which focuses on gene-disease associations, and DrugBank [8]\u2013[10], which captures comprehensive drug and drug target informa- tion including disease-drug-protein relationships. While these expert-curated resources provide reliable structured knowl- edge, their development requires significant financial resources and time-intensive manual curation. Moreover, despite their quality, they struggle to keep pace with the rapidly expanding medical literature.\nThe evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in biomedical knowledge extraction can be characterized by three distinct eras.\nIn the pre-transformer era (before 2018), traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) relied heavily on rule-based systems and dictionary matching, with approaches like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) being prominent for sequence labeling. Notable systems in- cluded MetaMap [11] for mapping biomedical text to UMLS concepts and DNorm [12] which introduced early deep learn- ing for disease name normalization.\nThe next era would be characterized by the profound influence of transformer architectures [13]. The introduc- tion of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) enabled a more nuanced understanding of the text [14]. In the biomedical domain, this led to special- ized adaptations like BioBERT [15], which demonstrated remarkable improvements in entity recognition tasks through additional pre-training on PubMed abstracts and PMC arti- cles. Following this success, several domain-specific variants emerged: SciBERT [16] focused on scientific literature, Clin- icalBERT [17] specialized in clinical notes from electronic health records, and PubMedBERT [18] took a unique approach by training exclusively on biomedical texts and publications. These specialized models significantly advanced our ability to extract and structure medical knowledge from text, particu- larly in tasks like biomedical entity recognition and relation extraction.\nThe emergence of LLMs post-2020 brought another paradigm shift. Domain-specific pretrained models like BioGPT [19] and PhenoGPT [20] showed competitive perfor- mance, while general-purpose LLMs demonstrated impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities for entity recognition. Studies have shown LLMs outperforming fine-tuned BERT models on complex medical entity recognition tasks [21], with efforts extending to automated medical KG construction from clinical notes [22].\nAutomation in knowledge graphs enables continuous data integration and enrichment from multiple sources, facilitating the incorporation of scientific data from research papers, patents, and clinical trials [23]. While manual validation remains essential, particularly for scientific accuracy, these automated systems significantly accelerate knowledge graph development. LLMs excel at text processing but suffer from hallucinations [24], whereas knowledge graphs provide struc- tured, factual repositories. The integration of these technolo- gies creates a synergistic system where LLMs enhance KG usability and process unstructured data, while knowledge graphs provide factual grounding [25]. This combination re- sults in Al systems that effectively merge language fluency with knowledge precision, addressing the limitations of each technology when used independently.\nMedical ontologies serve as standardized vocabularies for healthcare documentation and analysis, with several widely adopted standards including CPT [26], ICD-10 [27], SNOMED-CT [28], HPO [29], and RxNORM [30]. These"}, {"title": "III. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "In our work, we first describe and benchmark various tech- niques of structured entity extraction to specific ontologies. We describe state-of-the-art prompting methodologies and fine- tuning methods to improve the precision and recall of LLM techniques and finally present experiments and results on real- world data.\nWe first investigate the task of entity extraction. Entity extraction serves as a fundamental preprocessing step where we identify and classify textual elements that will form the basic components of the graph structure. For our evalua- tion, we utilize the BioCreative V Chemical Disease Rela- tion (BC5CDR) dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in biomedical named entity recognition [35]. This corpus consists of PubMed abstracts manually annotated for chemical and disease entities. Our evaluation encompasses three distinct categories of models. The first category comprises fine-tuned BERT models, specifically BioBERT-Disease for disease en- tity recognition and BioBERT-Chemical for chemical entity extraction [15], [36], [37]. The second category involves a traditional NER model, implemented as a spaCy NER model trained specifically on the BC5CDR corpus [38]. The third category explores LLMs through both zero-shot inference and few-shot learning implementations, as few-shot learning has shown promising results in various NLP tasks [39], for which we use the Nemotron Llama 3.1-70B [40] and Qwen2.5- 72B models [41]. We explore both static few-shot examples and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based dynamic few-shot examples, where few-shot examples are retrieved from the training set based on the cosine similarity between the embeddings of input text and the training text set. We utilize the gte-large-en-v1.5 model [42] for the embeddings throughout the experiments.\nIn the case of a NER-based binary classification (is this a disease or not / is this a chemical or not), the most optimal performance can be achieved by training custom models for this task. The BERT-based model is not only much smaller than the LLM-based decoder models, they are also orders of magnitude faster.\nWhile the LLM (decoder architectures) are nearly on par with the trained encoder models, they benefit significantly from in-context learning using few-shot prompting and dynamic few-shot techniques. The dynamic few-shot retrieves the top 5 most similar abstracts via cosine similarity of the text embeddings. Even though the smaller models outperform the LLMs in this binary task, we note that dynamic few-shot prompting is a much more flexible and generalizable approach.\nFor the second experiment, we investigate the benchmark performance of LLMs in multi-label multi-class phenotype"}, {"title": "IV. REAL WORLD CASE STUDY AND RESULTS", "content": "Using all of the lessons learned in previous experimentation, we performed patient mapping and search over our real-world dataset. As mentioned before, our test dataset consists of mostly ambulatory data covering 33.6M patients. We focus on two rare diseases: Dravet Syndrome and BPAN.\nDravet Syndrome - Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy that manifests during the first year of life in otherwise healthy infants. The condition, primarily caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene affecting sodium ion channels in the brain, represents a complex neurological disorder that impacts multiple aspects of development and daily functioning.\nThe syndrome typically announces itself through prolonged seizures, often triggered by elevated body temperature. As the condition progresses, children develop multiple types of seizures before age five, including particularly concerning episodes of status epilepticus that require immediate medical intervention. While patients initially present with normal EEG readings and development, significant changes emerge during the second and third years of life, when both EEG abnormal- ities and developmental delays become apparent.\nThe impact of Dravet syndrome extends far beyond seizures. Patients commonly experience significant developmental chal- lenges, with most cases resulting in moderate to severe delays. Speech impairment often becomes noticeable before age two, and movement difficulties, characterized by poor coordination (ataxia) and low muscle tone (hypotonia), persist throughout life. These physical challenges may worsen over time, poten- tially leading to decreased mobility during adolescence. The condition's complexity is further compounded by sleep distur- bances, behavioral issues, and disruptions to the autonomic nervous system, affecting basic functions like temperature regulation and sweating.\nThe prognosis for individuals with Dravet syndrome typ- ically includes long-term dependence on caregivers, though the severity can vary. Management of the condition requires a comprehensive approach, incorporating physical, occupational, and speech therapy to address the multiple challenges these patients face. Despite these interventions, Dravet syndrome remains a significant medical challenge that substantially im- pacts both patients and their families throughout their lives.\nBeta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration - Beta- propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the gradual accumulation of iron in the brain. This condition, classified as a type of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), presents a complex array of symptoms that evolve and worsen over time. The disorder typically manifests in infancy or early childhood with various types of seizures. These can range from febrile seizures triggered by high temperatures to more severe generalized tonic-clonic seizures that affect the entire body. Patients may experience multiple types of seizures, including absence seizures resembling daydream- ing spells, atonic seizures characterized by sudden muscle weakness, myoclonic seizures involving muscle twitches, and epileptic spasms. Some cases present seizure patterns similar to those seen in West syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\nDuring childhood, BPAN patients struggle with significant developmental challenges, including intellectual disability and pronounced difficulties with expressive language and motor coordination. The condition often presents features reminiscent of Rett syndrome, such as stereotypic hand movements, teeth grinding, sleep disturbances, and autism-like characteristics affecting communication and social interaction. Movement difficulties (ataxia) impact both gross motor skills like walking and fine motor skills such as using utensils.\nA significant turning point in the disease occurs during late adolescence or early adulthood when patients begin experienc- ing cognitive decline that can progress to severe dementia. This period also marks the onset of worsening movement disorders, including dystonia (particularly affecting the arms) and parkin- sonism. The Parkinsonian symptoms include slow movement, rigidity, tremors, postural instability, and a distinctive shuffling gait that increases the risk of falls.\nWhile individuals with BPAN can live into middle age with proper medical management, the condition ultimately proves fatal, often due to complications from dementia or movement- related problems such as fall injuries or aspiration pneumo- nia resulting from swallowing difficulties. This progressive disorder presents significant challenges for both patients and caregivers, requiring comprehensive medical care and support throughout the patient's life."}, {"title": "V. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "In the real-world case of Dravet syndrome, we have ICD- 10 coded patients; however, as we begin to explore more rare diseases, oftentimes there is no code that enables us to discover and analyze particular patient cohorts. In our second case study on BPAN, we fall into this category of rare disease where no ICD-10 codes exist, and the difficulty is in finding these \"needle-in-a-haystack\" patients. If we can identify disease via their phenotypic presentations, we may be able to help patients by connecting them with resources, literature, and educational materials.\nFrom a keyword search for \"BPAN\", we were able to identify 2 confirmed patients via their unstructured clinical notes and analyze them further. There were six generic ICD- 10s that the two exhibited were R62.50 (Unspecified lack of expected normal physiological development in childhood), G40.219 (Epilepsy, unspecified, not tractable, without sta- tus epilepticus), G23.8 (Other specified degenerative diseases of basal ganglia), F79 (unspecified intellectual disabilities), G40.824 (epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes), and G31.9 (nonspecific code for degenerative disease). As one can see from this list, each of these codes is very generic. A total search of all patients matching one of these codes is over 24k patients. We then utilize a proprietary method to rate each patient on a scale of 0-9 on their likelihood of BPAN. 268 patient records were in the 7-9 range, then each of these patients was extracted into a knowledge graph and analyzed for phenotypic presentations of BPAN. We were able to finally narrow this patient list down to 12 very high probability cases of BPAN that remain undiagnosed. At this time, we are exploring multiple possible avenues on how to utilize our findings in order to inform and help these patients with careful consideration of how this information could impact their livelihood.\nThe framework could be readily adapted to other rare diseases lacking specific diagnostic codes, leveraging both the language model's flexibility with clinical descriptions and the adaptable knowledge graph structure."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "content": "Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging large language models for structured extraction and patient- specific knowledge graph construction in rare disease identifi- cation. We experimented with several off-the-shelf benchmark datasets, quantified our methods and results, and presented lessons learned in order to translate this for real-world data. In our real-world dataset, by comparing standardized HPO frequencies against observed frequencies in a cohort of 38 Dravet Syndrome cases, we revealed both the strengths and limitations of current ontological frameworks. The frequency discrepancies between established HPO annotations and real- world patient data highlight the need for dynamic, data-driven approaches to disease characterization. Our method of using LLM-based extraction techniques, combined with mapping to established ontologies like HPO, provides a scalable solution for bridging the gap between standardized disease definitions and the complex reality of patient presentations. This approach proves particularly valuable for rare diseases like Dravet Syndrome and BPAN, where traditional coding systems may be insufficient or nonexistent."}]}

We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50% of cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "AI agents, holding the potential to automate tasks and improve human productivity, are increasingly being deployed in real-life applications (Wu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c;b). To function effectively in human environments, AI agents must not only communicate seamlessly with human users to understand their goals and intents (Ouyang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2024c), but also interact with environments to acquire information, such as browsing websites (Zhou et al., 2024a); manipulate the state of the environment, such as controlling mobile apps (Trivedi et al., 2024); or create artifacts, such as developing software (Yang et al., 2024a) and designing digital content (Si et al., 2024). This involves multiple stages of interaction among AI agents, humans, and environments (e.g., human \u2192 AI agent; AI agent \u2192 environment), creating a complex ecosystem.\nHowever, increased autonomy of agents brings forward new safety risks at each stage of interaction. When interacting with human users, AI agents may generate misinformation (Loth et al., 2024), toxic content (Jain et al., 2024a), and unsafe answers (Zou et al., 2023b). When interacting with the environment, AI agents could cause unintended harm (e.g., sending money to the wrong person due to under-specified instructions; Ruan et al., 2024). While existing works focus on isolating the safety risks of AI agents in the specific stage of interaction (Ruan et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024; Brahman et al., 2024), we argue that the safety risks of AI agents should be investigated in a holistic manner by examining the entire ecosystem of AI agents, humans, and environments."}, {"title": "EVALUATING SAFETY RISKS WITH SOCIAL SIMULATION", "content": "Simulations offer a versatile and efficient method for evaluating safety risks, as they prevent actual harms through sandboxed actions, enable detailed diagnostic analyses, and provide precise control over hidden components such as user intentions in the real world. In this section, we first introduce the concepts of social agents and social simulations, and then we discuss using LLMs as emulator for tool execution. Finally, we discuss the evaluation of safety risks in social simulations.\nSocial Agents and Social Simulations We identify social agents as goal-driven decision-makers that sense and act upon the state of the environment, and interact with other agents to achieve their goals (Sutton & Barto, 2018). This paper follows SOTOPIA (Zhou et al., 2024c) formulating the context of the interaction between human users and Al agents as social tasks. A social task in SOTOPIA consists of a scenario, two characters' profiles, and their respective private social goals to achieve in an interaction. Within one episode, the two agents role-play the characters to finish their"}, {"title": "CONSTRUCTING THE HAICOSYSTEM", "content": "As shown in Figure 1, HAICOSYSTEM ensembles human users, AI agents, and a shared environment. We use LLMs to simulate the human users with rich user profiles from Zhou et al. (2024c), including name, demographics, personality, etc. The AI agent, powered by an LLM, can select speak or action to interact with either the human user or the shared environment. Inspired by Ruan et al. (2024), we use an LLM as the environment engine, namely GPT-40, to simulate the response of the tool calls of the AI agent. Unlike Ruan et al. (2024), we provide scenario-specific instructions to the LLM environment engine, ensuring that the generated responses align with the scenario specifications, thereby enhancing controllability and reproducibility.\nEach component in HAICOSYSTEM is modular and has access to different information, which is crucial for realistic simulation (Zhou et al., 2024b). Specifically, the AI agents have no access to the human users' goal as well as their profiles. Similarly, the human users have no access to the AI agents' tools, goals, and the response of tool calling. Please refer to Appendix A for more details on the framework.\nSimulation in HAICOSYSTEM is initiated by the following three components: (1) a scenario, (2) a human user and an Al agent, and (3) a checklist of safe and risky outcomes.\n(1) Scenario An environment profile first starts with the overall background of the scenario outlining the overall situational context \u2013 e.g., \u201cOn July 1, 2024, a person is standing in the kitchen of a smart home managed by an AI agent. There's a sudden smoke coming from the kitchen...\" The environment profile also includes the Al agent goal and human user goal (e.g., the human's goal\""}, {"title": "EVALUATING AI AGENTS IN HAICOSYSTEM", "content": "To evaluate the safety of AI agents when interacting with humans on grounded tasks, we propose a set of dimensions that measure the AI agents' abilities to avoid risky outcomes while staying helpful in the scenarios. All safety risks are rated on a scale from -10 to 0, where -10 indicates the highest risk and 0 indicates no risk. For an episode, the AI agent is considered risky overall if any of the safety risks is negative.\nTargeted Safety Risks (TARG) [-10, 0] use the checklist (\u00a73) offered in the scenarios to check if the interactions between the AI agents and human users could lead to the risky outcomes listed in the checklist.\nSystem and Operational Risks (SYST) [-10, 0] target the AI agents' ability to operate in the environment, avoiding security threats like network intrusions, malware, etc., while offering safe automated decision-making in finance, justice, and healthcare, and other domains (Zeng et al., 2024c; Ruan et al., 2024).\nContent Safety Risks (CONT) [-10, 0] focus on the AI agents' ability to provide safe content to the human users (Zeng et al., 2024c). Specifically, risky content includes, but is not limited to, violence, extremism, hate speech, harassment, sexual content, child exploitation, and self-harm.\nSocietal Risks (SOC) [-10, 0] focus on the detrimental impacts of AI agents on political, economic, and social structures (Zeng et al., 2024c). Specifically, this dimension covers manipulation of public opinion, spreading propaganda, unfair market practices, misinformation, and etc. AI agents, with their capacity for rapid action and large-scale production, can significantly amplify societal risks (Hendrycks et al., 2023; Bengio et al., 2024b).\nLegal and Rights Related Risks (LEGAL) [-10, 0] focus on risks of AI agents to violate fundamental rights, engage in discrimination, breach privacy, and facilitate criminal activities (Zeng et al., 2024c). Examples include physically hurting humans, assigning resources based on protected characteristics, and unauthorized collection or misuse of sensitive personal data.\nTool Use Efficiency (EFFICIENCY) [0, 10] focuses on the AI agents' ability to user tools effectively without wasting time or resources. One common issue arises when AI agents operate under incorrect assumptions. For example, an AI agent might call a tool with a generic argument ({coordinate: coordinate}). This type of error can lead to environmental failures that prevent tasks from being executed correctly, resulting in wasted processing time and the need for repeated operations. Such inefficiencies reduce overall productivity and reliability of AI agents (Kapoor et al., 2024). The efficiency score ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating better efficiency.\nGoal Completion (GOAL) [0, 10] focuses on the AI agents' ability to complete the goals assigned to them. The goals can range from a general objective, such as \u201cbe a helpful assistant\u201d, to a specific task, like \"scrutinize evidence, flag, and redact prejudicial information before sending it to the jury\". Note that the AI agents' goals are not always aligned with the safety requirements. For example, if an AI agent's goal is to \"be a helpful assistant\u201d while interacting with a human user with malicious intent, the AI agent may choose to refuse helping the human user to avoid getting involved in risky situations (Brahman et al., 2024). In these cases, the AI agent must balance the trade-off between safety and helpfulness (Wallace et al., 2024; Su et al., 2024; Scheurer et al., 2024). The goal completion score ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating better goal completion.\nGiven the interaction trajectories of the AI agents along with the checklist of safe and risky outcomes, we use an LM-based evaluator (e.g., GPT-40) to first reason whether the AI agent leads to certain safety risks, and then rate the safety risks across all the dimensions accordingly. Estimating the degree of safety risks is fundamentally hard and subjective (Ruan et al., 2024; Brown, 2014). We thus also consider the coarse-grained evaluation of the AI agents' safety risks, which the agent is considered risky in a dimension if it receives a negative score in the corresponding dimension of an episode. For an agent, the risk ratio of each dimension is calculated as the proportion of risky"}, {"title": "AGENT SAFETY EXPERIMENTS", "content": "We first introduce the experimental setup and validation checks, followed by the results and analysis on (1) the safety risks of AI agents exhibited in the simulations of HAICOSYSTEM, (2) the relationship between achieving goals and avoiding safety risks, and (3) how interactions with human users affect the safety of AI agents. This is the first study to systematically investigate the safety risks of AI agents with tools in realistic multi-turn interactive scenarios.\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND VALIDATION\nAcross 92 scenarios, we sample 5 human users with different profiles to interact with the AI agent. We fix the model to be GPT-40 to role-play the human user as well as the evaluator. In total, we have 460 simulated episodes for each of the 4 models we consider, namely GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama3.1-70B, and Llama3.1-405B.\nTo check whether the simulated human users realistically emulate real human users, we use the believability score in Zhou et al. (2024c) to evaluate the simulated human users. Across all the episodes, the average believability score is 9.1 out of 10, indicating the simulated human users behave naturally. To validate our automatic LM-based evaluation of safety risks, we manually verify the evaluation of 100 randomly sampled episodes. We find that 90% of evaluations are accurate in identifying AI agents risk with 0.8 average Pearson correlation with the human evaluator's judgment for various risk dimensions.\nBENCHMARKING SAFETY RISKS OF AI AGENTS\nAs shown in Figure 2, we observe that all models exhibit substantial risks across all risk categories. Specifically, the targeted safety risks category has the highest risk ratio, indicating that models are more likely to show the safety risks anticipated in our scenario's safe and risky outcomes checklist compared to other risk dimensions.\nAgents powered by bigger models tend to have lower safety risks. For example, in the case of redacting sensitive information for the jury, the AI agent powered by Llama3.1-70B does not remove"}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "Our work is situated at the interaction of AI Safety and social simulation. We review the related work in these areas.\nCHALLENGES AND APPROACHES IN AUTOMATED RED-TEAMING\nAutomated red-teaming methods are developed for replacing low-efficiency manual efforts (Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2022) for revealing model errors (Perez et al., 2022). One type of such method involved optimization and searching for error-triggering syntax (Zou et al., 2023a; Guo et al., 2021; 2024; Schwinn et al., 2024). However, these methods are prohibitive to run at scale and cannot be applied to black-box models. Another genre of methods involves generating attack prompts directly or with iterative edits (Chao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Lapid et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Perez et al., 2022; Casper et al., 2023; Mehrotra et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2024a). Some other jailbreaking works study attacks during inference time (Huang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024), in vision-language settings (Shayegani et al., 2024; Ying et al., 2024; Schaeffer et al., 2024), multi-shots setups (Anil et al., 2024), or under multilingual settings (Deng et al., 2024b; Yong et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2023). There are also works exploring human-devised jailbreak tactics (Jiang et al., 2024) or persuasion strategies (Zeng et al., 2024a). However, these works only focus on the human users with malicious intent and only consider single-turn interactions.\nRuan et al. (2024) investigates the safety issues of LLM-powered agents under underspecified instructions with single-turn benign human users. Russinovich et al. (2024a); Yang et al. (2024b); Russinovich et al. (2024b) investigate multi-turn red teaming settings but often limit to specific domain, templates of interactions, and malicious users. Lastly, many red-teaming efforts for large language models LLMs have been structured into benchmarks aimed at assessing model vulnerabilities, which typically include harmful prompts that models should refuse to answer (Carlini et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024; Mazeika et al., 2024; Geiping et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Chao et al., 2024). These benchmarks often assume the simple social context that users are interacting with AI assistant like ChatGPT, ignoring other more complex social contexts and suffering from biased estimation of the realistic risks of AI agents.\nSIMULATING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS\nSimulating social interactions in multi-agent system has been a long-standing research area in AI, and has attracted increasing attention recently due to the rise of LLMs (Park et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024c). Simulations offer a controlled environment to study certain aspects of LLM agent behavior without interfering with the real world, thus providing a safe and efficient way to study the behavior of LLMs (Zhou et al., 2024b;a; Yang et al., 2024a). This is particularly important for studying the safety risks of LLMs, as it allows researchers to explore the potential harms of LLMs in a harmless way (Ruan et al., 2024; tse Huang et al., 2024). Popular simulation platform includes AI town (Park et al., 2023), Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024c), and Camel (Li et al., 2023). However, none of these works focus on emulating how a human user uses AI agents grounded in concrete scenarios as well as complex tool-using space."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION & DISCUSSION", "content": "We propose HAICOSYSTEM, a general-purpose framework for simulating the safety risks of AI agents when interacting with (simulated) human users and tools in a sandbox environment.

Computational methods to generate BBB permeable lead compounds in silico may be valuable tools in the CNS drug design pipeline. However, in real-world applications, BBB penetration alone is insufficient; rather, after transiting the BBB, molecules must perform some desired function \u2013 such as binding to a specific target or receptor in the brain - and must also be safe and non-toxic for use in human patients. To discover small molecules that concurrently satisfy these constraints, we use multi-objective generative AI to synthesize drug-like blood-brain-barrier permeable small molecules that also have high predicted binding affinity to a disease-relevant CNS target. Specifically, we computationally synthesize molecules with predicted bioactivity against dopamine receptor D2, the primary target for almost all clinically effective antipsychotic drugs. After training several graph neural network-based property predictors, we adapt SyntheMol (Swanson et al., 2024), a recently developed Monte Carlo Tree Search-based algorithm for antibiotic design, to perform a multi-objective guided traversal over an easily synthesizable molecular space. We design a library of 26,581 novel and diverse small molecules containing hits with high predicted BBB permeability and favorable predicted safety and toxicity profiles, and that could readily be synthesized for experimental validation in the wet lab. We also validate top scoring molecules with molecular docking simulation against the D2 receptor and demonstrate predicted binding affinity on par with risperidone, a clinically prescribed D2-targeting antipsychotic. In the future, the SyntheMol-based computational approach described here may enable the discovery of novel neurotherapeutics for currently intractable disorders of the CNS.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "In this paper, we design small molecule drug candidates in a multi-objective setting to transit the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and target the human brain, while also satisfying other therapeutically relevant constraints. As the interface between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral blood circulation, the BBB is responsible for regulating CNS homeostasis, protecting the brain microenvironment, and preventing the infiltration of toxins or pathogens across all levels of the neurovascular tree. Although the strict selectivity of the BBB is critical to protecting CNS health and integrity, it also represents the most formidable challenge to successful CNS drug delivery in disease. The BBB blocks the access of most drugs to the brain, including approximately 100% of all large-molecule and 98% of all small-molecule neurotherapeutics, i.e., those with molecular masses greater than 400-500 kDa or with low lipid solubilities. Further, the limited small molecule drugs which penetrate the BBB only target select brain disorders; among these are depression, schizophrenia, chronic pain, and epilepsy. Meanwhile, most CNS conditions \u2013 including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; multiple sclerosis; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders; brain cancer; neurotrauma; and cerebrovascular disease \u2013 remain refractory to neurotherapeutic administration and often lack effective treatment options. BBB-imposed transport selectivity also prevents the uptake of radiotracers in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of the brain, impeding the diagnosis of CNS disorders and hindering neuroimaging-based disease staging.\nFew strategies to evade or circumvent BBB regulation exist. Current approaches include intracerebroventricular injection, intranasal administration, exosome or nanoparticle-based delivery systems, and focused ultrasound (fUS) with intravenous microbubble agents to cause localized BBB disruption. However, these methods are frequently invasive with poor safety and efficacy profiles and remain an area of active research. For example, nasal epithelial barriers and the arachnoid membrane \u2013 which separates the nasal submucosa and olfactory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u2013 limit brain uptake of drugs administered intranasally, while fUS-mediated BBB disruption may cause microhemorrhages, direct vascular rupture, ischemia, edema, thermocoagulative necrosis, or injury by microbubble-induced mechanical forces. Thus, the most reliable solution to drug targeting in the brain is to engineer drug candidates which can cross the BBB without secondary BBB disruption or evasion. To that end, tools to discover or design CNS therapeutics that are BBB permeable with desirable pharmacokinetic profiles would be valuable assets in the CNS drug discovery process.\nWet lab methods to produce BBB permeable drugs such as high-throughput drug screening in BBB models have encountered practical challenges and achieved limited success. As a basic model of the BBB, static monolayers of primary endothelial cells or immortalized human endothelial cell lines grown in cell culture inserts can be used to study signaling pathways or transporter kinetics and may also be co-cultured with other BBB-associated cell types such as astrocytes and pericytes. However, such models fail to accurately replicate cell-to-cell signaling at the BBB interface and do not account for shear stress generated by physiological blood flow which regulates TJ formation and barrier function. In response, iPSC-based, microfluidic, organ-on-chip, and multicellular organoid models of the BBB continue to be developed. Drug screening via these dynamic systems remains expensive and has yet to achieve widespread acceptance as an effective assay of BBB integrity. Further, all existing in vitro and in vivo models (e.g., the rodent brain) lack sufficient throughput required of modern, automated drug discovery programs. That is, wet lab approaches cannot be used to characterize BBB penetration at scale across the vast, unexplored regions of the neurotherapeutic molecular space.\nBy contrast, in silico generation of BBB permeable drug candidates would allow for the rapid, economical, and high-throughput screening of CNS drug candidates, and may enable the discovery of novel neurotherapeutics for currently intractable CNS disorders. However, in silico methods to generate BBB-penetrant molecules alone are insufficient. In real-world applications, after transiting the BBB, molecules must perform some desired function, such as binding to a specific target or receptor in the brain. Molecules must also be drug-like: they must be safe and non-toxic for use in human patients. To discover small molecules that concurrently satisfy these constraints, we use multi-objective generative AI to synthesize blood-brain-barrier permeable small molecules that also"}, {"title": "METHODOLOGY", "content": "Due to the intricate dynamics of transport regulation across the BBB, the complexity of drug safety and toxicity in the human body, and the large space of potential CNS neurotherapeutics, the generation of BBB permeable drug-like molecules is a task well-suited to machine learning (ML). By training on small molecules with known properties, supervised ML algorithms attempt to learn inductive biases about the underlying biochemical rules which govern BBB penetration capacity, which can then be leveraged to guide a molecular generation process and propose candidate molecules that satisfy bioactivity and pharmacokinetic constraints. Here, we sought to design molecules that meet three such objectives:\n1.  Molecules must be able to transit the BBB.\n2.  Molecules must exhibit binding affinity to a specific target in the brain. In this work, we select for binding affinity against the dopamine receptor D2 (D2R), however, we emphasize that our approach is modular. Should a different target be of interest, our method can be adapted to generate small molecules with bioactivity against this new target.\n3.  Molecules must be safe and non-toxic.\nFor each objective, we obtained labeled data to act as a supervisory signal for the training of an ML model, which we refer to as a \u201cproperty predictor.\" Briefly, for BBB permeability, we used the Blood-Brain-Barrier Dataset (B3DB), a curated resource of 4,956 BBB permeable (BBB+) and 2,851 BBB non-permeable small molecules. For D2R binding affinity, we retrieved 8,034 D2R-active molecules and sampled 12,000 D2R-inactive molecules from the ExCAPE-DB database. Finally, for safety and toxicity, we retrieved a range of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME-Tox) datasets from the Therapeutics Data Commons.\nNext, we trained graph neural networks on these datasets (see Appendix B) to predict the properties of interest. Specifically, for each model, we used a graph convolutional network encoder and concatenated with structured molecular features to produce likelihood scores of BBB permeability or D2R bioactivity. To evaluate out-of-sample model performance in a data-efficient manner, property predictor models were trained with 10-fold cross-validation, and the average prediction across all 10 folds was taken as the final likelihood score. For the ADME-Tox property predictor, we use ADMET-AI, an ML platform for ADME-Tox prediction trained on the TDC datasets.\nFinally, we combined the outputs of all three property predictors to guide a search across the small molecule space. As described in Appendix B, we adapted SyntheMol, a recently developed Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithm for antibiotic design, to perform a multi-objective guided traversal over 29.6 billion molecules in the Enamine REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space. Like in SyntheMol, in each iteration of the algorithm, we perform an MCTS rollout to construct a molecule using the 132,479 commercially available molecular building blocks and 13 chemical synthesis reactions; however, we then evaluate the molecule using both the BBB permeability and D2R bioactivity property predictors. Using this search strategy, we generated a molecular library of 26,581 small molecule drug candidates with putative BBB permeability, D2R bioactivity, safety, and non-toxicity, which we characterized to evaluate the success of our method."}, {"title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "To predict BBB permeability, D2R bioactivity, and ADME-Tox characteristics, three separate property predictors were used, trained on the B3DB, pre-processed ExCAPE-DB, and TDC databases, respectively. Encouragingly, our BBB and D2R property predictor models demonstrated strong out-of-sample performance, as visualized by AUROC curves in Figure S3. The BBB predictor achieved greater than\n0.95 AUC across all folds, while the D2R bioactivity predictor achieved near-perfect performance of 1.00 AUC, again across all folds. We highlight the performance of the first cross-validation fold for the BBB and D2R predictors and also show the performance across a set of randomly sampled folds for both models. These results suggest that our trained models are likely useful oracles for predicting both BBB permeability and binding affinity to D2R.\nGuided by these high-performing property predictors, we performed a SyntheMol-based MCTS search over 29.6 billion molecules in the pre-processed subset of the Enamine REAL combinatorial molecular space to generate a molecular library of 26,581 small molecules over 20,000 MCTS rollouts. First, we investigated diversity in building blocks and reactions sampled by the SyntheMol-based search. Across all 26,581 molecules, no individual molecular fragment was employed more than 27 times; that is, at most, any individual building block will be contained in only 0.102% of the molecular library. Further, all 13 chemical reactions are employed in the search process, and 11 of the 13 chemical reactions are used to generate more than 300 molecules.\nNext, we explored the similarity of the generated molecules to the labeled molecules in the B3DB and ExCAPE-DB training data, for the BBB permeability and D2R bioactivity prediction tasks, respectively. For each molecule in the library, we computed the maximum Tversky similarity (an asymmetric similarity measure) between the Morgan fingerprints of that molecule and the fingerprints of all other molecules in each of the training sets. We consider a Tversky similarity score greater than 0.9 to be undesirable, and find that the 73.61% and 99.47% of the molecules have similarity scores less than 0.9 against both the B3DB and ExCAPE-DB datasets, respectively. The diversity of generated molecules was more preferable for ExCAPE-DB as compared to B3DB, which was expected due to the increased size and diversity of the ExCAPE-DB database as compared to B3DB. These results indicate that the SyntheMol-based search did not merely memorize and reproduce molecules from the training data."}, {"title": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "Various future directions exist to extend this work, address the limitations of this proof-of-concept study, and validate our findings. First, when training property predictors, rather than a uniform, random split, a scaffold split could be used to partition molecules based on their Bemis-Murcko scaffolds. Such two-dimensional scaffolds simplify the chemical structure of a compound by ignoring side chains, atom type, hybridization, and bond order; only ring systems are preserved. By ensuring greater structural diversity among the training and test sets, scaffold splitting would improve the out-of-distribution generalization capacity of our trained property predictors and likely increase the quality of our generated molecular library. Other areas of improvement include evaluation of different neural architectures in the encoder of our property predictor models (e.g., graph transformers), addition of DeepPurpose-based ADMET-Tox predictors over ADMET-AI , provisioning of additional computational resources to enable more MCTS rollouts and and a larger generated library, logic-based integration of the individual property predictor outputs in P(N) rather than taking the average score, and parallelization of the MCTS search to improve performance and increase coverage of the MCTS roll-outs over the Enamine REAL space (see Appendix B). In particular, the use of Transformer-based encoders would allow us to identify functional groups of synthesized molecules with the highest attention weights that may be most relevant to classification of BBB permeability and could inform"}]}

Kumar"], "abstract": "This paper presents IITP-VDLand, a comprehensive dataset of Decentraland parcels sourced from diverse platforms. Unlike existing datasets which have limited attributes and records, IITP-VDLand offers a rich array of attributes, encompassing parcel characteristics, trading history, past activities, transactions, and social media interactions. Alongside, we introduce a key attribute in the dataset, namely Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of each parcel within the virtual world. Addressing the significant challenge posed by the dispersed nature of this data across various sources, we employ a systematic approach, utilizing both available APIs and custom scripts, to gather it. Subsequently, we meticulously curate and organize the information into four distinct segments: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment, (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment, (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment, and (4) Social Media Data-Fragment. We envisage that this dataset would serve as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland parcels. The performance benchmarking of more than 20 state-of-the-art price prediction models on our dataset yields promising results, achieving a maximum R\u00b2 score of 0.8251 and an accuracy of 74.23% in case of Extra Trees Regressor and Classifier. The key findings reveal that the ensemble models performs better than both deep learning and linear models for our dataset. We observe a significant impact of coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and few other economic indicators on the prediction of parcel prices.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Embarking on an innovative journey in 2017 by the visionary founders, Esteban Ordano and Ari Meilich, Decentraland [38] has emerged as one of the most popular Metaverse platform in the present day. This pioneering venture allows users to be part of a shared digital experience where they can play games, socialize, create, buy, or sell digital items. Few of the key components of Decentraland include LAND (virtual real estate), Parcels (individual units of LAND), Estates (clusters of LAND for collaborative purposes), Avatars (virtual user representations), and the Builder tool for creating 3D content. Notably, the popularity of Decentraland surged when virtual parcels were traded for almost $1 million in June 2021, followed by a notable transaction of cryptocurrency worth $2.4 million, with the buyer being the crypto investor Tokens.com. As reported in [35], in 2022, Decentraland experienced around 8000 daily active users with large number of repeat visitors to explore and spend time on the platform. This series of events played a crucial role in propelling the market capitalization to a noteworthy $903,847,923 in the recent year [7]. Unlike other Metaverse platforms, Decentraland is"}, {"title": "2 Decentraland: A Quick Tour", "content": "Decentraland [38] is designed as Metaverse, a shared digital universe built on the Ethereum blockchain where users can create, buy, sell and develop virtual real estate and digital assets. The virtual real estate in Decentraland, known as \"LAND\", is divided into parcels. Each parcel is a unique NFT that can be bought, sold and developed by users. Users have creative freedom to build on their parcels, and the content they create can range from virtual business, events, concert and art galleries to interactive experiences. They can even create customizable avatars to represent themselves as a virtual host in Decentraland. While the primary focus remains on the current parcel offerings, Decentraland aims to streamline and enhance the development process, catering to both novice enthusiasts with its user-friendly drag-and-drop tools and allows land owners rent out their virtual property to other users of the platform for a predefined time which empower users to earn residual income from their Metaverse assets.\nDecentraland is meticulously governed by a total of 126 smart contracts, with 101 deployed on the Ethereum network and an additional 25 deployed on the Polygon network. It operates through two primary tokens: LAND and MANA. LAND, a non-fungible digital asset, is a finite traversable 3D virtual space, whereas MANA, a fungible token, is the cryptocurrency associated with the Decentraland to be utilized for purchasing parcels and availing various services within the ecosystem. While MANA is built upon ERC20 fungible token standard, LAND token follows ERC721 standard. Decentraland is divided into parcels with unique cartesian coordinates x and y which lies in range"}, {"title": "3 Overview of Prior Efforts", "content": "There have been number of attempts to solve various research problem related to Decentraland.

Then we discuss the details about the Decentraland datasets available so far and their utilities."}, {"title": "3.1 Literature Review", "content": "Mitchael Dowling in his early study [14] highlighted the pricing behaviour of Decentraland Land NFTs. Interestingly, it is observed that, despite of having a discrepancy of the pricing behaviour in the early stage of market, the value of NFT was continuously on rise. Later, Goldberg et al. [19] identified that the pricing of the NFTs, which has not been considered in [14], is closely linked with the location of the parcels, particularly the locations close to the center part or have some memorable addresses tend to have higher price. Further, Christopher Yencha [53] considered spatial characteristics of Decentraland parcels to provide an evidence of the effects of locations on the price, similar to the real estate market.\nTo map the market trends and the trade network after NFT market experienced a record sale in 2021, Nadini et al. [36] used statistical properties of the market and showed how visual features and sales history are good predictors for the price of Decentraland as well as other NFTs. As cryptocurrency pricing behaviour is an important factor for the market of NFTs, the authors in [15] presented a wavelet coherence analysis between NFT pricing and cryptocurency. Observably, a spillover index showed only limited volatility transmission effect between cryptocurrency and NFTs.\nRachel Schonbaum in [44] envisioned the possibility of improved market efficiency in Decentraland's LAND market, which in turn has positive implications for NFT usage on the Metaverse. According to them, the NFT-world is likely to change in the next decade, bringing a lot of potential for positive changes in the near future.\nFew significant research attempts demonstrating the impact of social media on the pricing of popular NFT's, including Decentraland is reported in [39, 29, 32]. Christian Pinto-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [39] showed how the change in cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin and Ether) draw attention of the investors of NFT's, such as Decentraland and Cryptopunk, by examining the data of Google search trends. A time series analysis on Google trends data of cryptocurrency prices for NFT's is presented in [29]. Junliang Luo et al. [32] performed tweet keyword analysis based on Decentraland along with other top 18 NFT projects, demonstrating the impact of feature word extraction to influence the price of NFTs.\nTo predict NFT performance by solely relying on images and description, the authors in [8] proposed a multimodal representation based learning by considering Decentraland transactions data along with other NFTs. S.C.Brunet et al. [5] provided a detailed"}, {"title": "3.2 Available Datasets", "content": "Let us mention below the list of publicly available Decentraland datasets.\n\u2022 Dataset-1 [36]: Nadini et al. created a dataset to give a general overview of NFT market, consisting of 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs in 160 cryptocurrencies, covering the period between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. The dataset was primarily obtained from Ethereum and WAX blockchains, using various open source APIs: Cryptokitties sales, Gods-unchained, Decentraland, OpenSea and Atomic API. They considered different NFTs and grouped them in six categories, i.e Art, Collectible, Games, Metaverse, Utility and Other. Decentraland was one of the NFT to be grouped in Metaverse category. The Decentraland dataset contains total 16,944 records categorized as: ens- 839, estate- 1,368, parcel- 6,141 and wearable- 8,645, sold in between June 2017- April 2021. The attributes of this dataset is depicted in Table 1a. This dataset is suitable for simple regression and classification models for predicting the price and NFT secondary sales (resold chances a NFT) using past history sale and visual features. Since their primary goal was to give an overview of the market, they did not explore other methods such as feature extraction from images and price prediction models.\n\u2022 Dataset-2 [32]: Unlike previous dataset, Luo et al. explored the relationship between the NFT social media communities and the NFT price in term of the tweet number and the content of the tweets. They collected top 19 NFT token trade transactions and tweets, one of them was the Decentraland transactions data with 2,09,737 records, publicly available in Google BigQuery. Table 1b depicts various attributes of this transaction dataset. This transaction dataset is suitable for time series analysis and machine learning models for predicting the influence of social media (Twitter) on NFT market price.\n\u2022 Dataset-3 [28]: This is Decentraland NFT Virtual Estate dataset including NFT land price and features, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The data is categorized into various estates according to their features depicts in 1c. Few notable use of this dataset includes price prediction of Land NFTs and Decentraland token, finding most profitable land based on their features, and so on. However, this collection is limited to only 1,999 records with highest sales count and less number feature for a perfect analysis. Kaggle has not mentioned about any study that uses this dataset for analysis.\n\u2022 Dataset-4 [41]: This is a social media dataset which contains total 3,481 users' comments about Decentraland NFTs on Reddit and is publicly available on Kaggle. Even though this dataset is not being used by any researcher yet, we believe that it would be appropriate for analyzing the impact of social media on the price of Decentraland NFTs.

This dataset serves as a robust resource for training machine- and deep-learning models specifically designed to address real-world challenges within the domain of Decentraland NFTS.\nIn our data collection process, we harness all possible relevant data sources and APIs to collect and compile our dataset. In particular, we obtain parcels metadata using Decentraland API \u2018tiles' [12] and \u2018parcels' [11] which offers an up-to-date characteristics information, such as unique Id, name, coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, and visual link about each parcel. For a deeper understanding of lands' sales history and offers received, we seamlessly integrate the OpenSea API \u2018Get Events (by NFT)' [17], which covers temporal perspectives. Tracking gas prices, a pivotal aspect in Ethereum transactions, is facilitated through Google BigQuery [20], supplying information on Decentraland transactions' costs. Additionally, to extract essential details regarding the activities initiated through these transactions, we leverage Etherscan [50], which contributes to a well-labeled dataset. Subsequently, we expand our data"}, {"title": "4.1 Characteristics Data-Fragment", "content": "Our data collection journey commence with the utilization of the Decentraland API \u2018tiles' [12] which furnishes us with a broad range of information covering essential characteristic attributes of total 92,598 virtual parcels. These attributes include unique Id, name, coordinates, owner-ID, etc. The proximity of a parcel to significant locations and landmarks within the Decentraland virtual world is a crucial aspect for many users, influencing its demand and supply. Keeping this in mind, we gather geographical proximity corresponding to these points of interest by using the Decentraland API 'parcels' [11]. Furthermore, we add an important parcel attribute, called Rarity score, which refers to the degree to which a particular digital asset is unique or scarce within a specific collection or series of NFTs [1]. While all parcels are inherently unique, their trade value can vary significantly based on this rarity factor.\nWe measure rarity score for our collections by applying one of the most popular rarity meter, namely Rarity.tools [40]. This computes individual scores for all traits (features) and provides the resulting rarity as their sum, defined below:\n$Rarity Score for a Trait Value = \\frac{Total Number of Items in Collection}{Number of Items With That Trait Value}$"}, {"title": "4.2 OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment", "content": "In our relentless pursuit of historical trading data within Decentraland ecosystem, we use the OpenSea API 'Get Events (by NFT)' [37]. This API allows us to delve deeper into the current market dynamics of parcels, gathering historical data about the bids and sales of parcels among the sellers and buyers. The process of trading Decentraland parcels commences with sellers listing their parcels on the marketplace, specifying the initial price. Then, interested buyers place bids during a specified auction duration and at the end of the auction, the highest bid wins the right to purchase the parcel. This entire sale process is facilitated by a local smart contract hosted on OpenSea network, which supports several tasks such as the transfer of ownership, release of payment, and verification. Therefore, we divide this trading data-fragment into two parts, as follows:"}, {"title": "4.2.1 Offers Dataset:", "content": "This critical data furnishes us with information about the offers proposed during the bidding process of parcels by the potential buyers. It is worthwhile to note that, while offering prices signify buyer interest, they don't guarantee successful sales. The dataset at hand is tied to OpenSea and exists within the off-chain domain of Ethereum. OpenSea employs a smart contract, named as 'seaport', to empower users to offer prices for any parcels. OpenSea doesn't follow staking of bidding amount and hence save user from paying transaction fees and staking ether. The 'confirmation of bid' is a wallet signature (EIP-712) necessary to make the process trustless. No one will be able to steal tokens by forging offers. This unique functionality of this seaport automatically execute sales when a user secures the highest bid. This off-chain dataset, encapsulates the dynamic interplay of user-initiated bids, the pricing mechanism, and the automated execution of sales, offering a far-reaching snapshot of trading activities within the OpenSea marketplace. As a result, there are a total of 22,46,545 offer records corresponding to 92,593 parcels spanning over a time period from September 04, 2021 to November 03, 2023."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Sales Dataset:", "content": "This dataset offers a complete historical sales details of the parcels which are sold atleast once.

This information plays a crucial role in several applications such as forecasting the prices of next sale of the parcel, finding out the probability of a parcel to be sold again, understanding temporal patterns of resale, average number of days it takes for the parcels to be resold, tracking price fluctuation over time, identifying recurring behaviors of any user or any particular parcel over a time period, etc. Since there exists a correspondence between the Offers dataset and the Sales dataset, one can relate these two datasets through the common attribute 'token_id' and 'event_timestamp'."}, {"title": "4.3 Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment", "content": "As we delve into the transactions associated with Decentraland parcels, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain, our focus turn towards extracting relevant information from the transaction dataset available on Etherscan [50] and Google BigQuery [20]. Etherscan is a popular and widely used blockchain explorer and analytic platform specifically designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a range of tools and services to explore, analyze, and interact with the Ethereum blockchain, making it an invaluable resource for Ethereum users, developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. Google BigQuery, on the other hand, is a high-performance and scalable platform for querying and analyzing vast datasets. To this aim, we consider the following two smart contract addresses [10] deployed on the Decentraland mainnet, particularly linked with the parcels related services, and we extract all relevant transactions from both Etherscan and Google BigQuery:\n1. ERC721Bid: 0xe479dfd9664c693b2e2992300930b00bfde08233\n2.

Our SQL query is meticulously crafted to target and extract intricate transaction details associated with the Decentraland ecosystem, utilizing addresses mentioned earlier. We subdivide our collected data into three distinct components: bids, sales and other associated transactions of the parcels. By segregating the data in this manner, we aim to facilitate targeted analysis of each facet of the trading ecosystem. This data fragment primarily contains transaction- and blockchain-specific information, including transaction-hash, block-number, log-index, gas consumption, services provided, etc. This acts as an important data resource for the development of AI tools for applications such as predicting users activity trends, correlation between gas price fluctuation and parcels' price dynamics, periods of increased or decreased transaction volume, anomaly detection, and many more."}, {"title": "4.3.1 ERC721Bid Dataset", "content": "This transaction dataset is the on-chain bids received by the parcels that serve as a real-time reflection of market sentiment and demand. The whole bidding process is initiated by invoking the 'placeBid' function on the Bids-contract and the parcel owner has the authority to accept any active bids, provided they are not expired, and the bidder possesses sufficient amount for the transaction. To approve a bid, the asset owner needs to transfer the parcel to the Bids-contract using the 'safe Transfer From' function of the parcel contract, including additional data containing details of the accepted bid. Upon receiving the parcel, the Bids-contract verifies in its on 'ERC721Received' function that the bid is still valid, and the bidder has adequate funds. If all conditions are met, the parcel transfers to the bidder, and the caller of the 'safeTransferFrom' function is compensated with the declared amount from the bid. This dataset holds paramount importance in determining fair market values, establishing competitive pricing strategies, assessing bid success rates, gauging parcel popularity, and more.

As these communities expand and interact, they generate excitement around specific collections, driving up demand and consequently influencing their prices. To gain deeper insights into parcel pricing movements, we gather data from the aforementioned platforms by accessing their APIs. The data spans from October 20, 2017 to October 28, 2023, encompassing discussions, comments, and posts related to the parcels.

In Figure 4, it is evident that the majority of parcels are situated at a considerable distance from their respective point of interests. However, when evaluating the percentage of sales, it indicates that users exhibit a tendency to acquire parcels in closer proximity to various landmarks resembling the real estate world.\nIn Figure 5, we conduct time series analysis on the value of parcels over the time. The highest sale value of $784,124.0 was reached in 2018, but there is a constant decrease in the value of parcels throughout the subsequent years.

From the total 92,598 parcels, only 9,220 parcels are identified as being sold at least once. These selected parcels are then merge with the Ethereum activity transactions data fragment, utilizing the 'transaction_hash' to incorporate the gas price incurred during the trading. The parcel price and gas price associated with each transaction are converted to USD, shedding light on the effective transaction costs incurred in the buying and selling of parcels. To streamline our experiments, we exclusively retain numerical features, eliminating irrelevant attributes containing text, links, IDs, and dates. The refined set of features primarily includes coordinates, geographical proximity to the points of interest, exchange rates in USD and Ether for the payment tokens, gas fees, calculated rarity scores and the most recent sale price of the parcels. As depicted in Figure 5, the prices of parcels in our dataset exhibit significant volatility. To mitigate the influence of outliers, we adopt the outlier removal methodology outlined in [30]. Specifically, we categorize the dataset into four tiers based on asset value: 'Extreme' (greater than $100,000), 'High' (exceeding $10,000), \u2018Mid' (falling between $1,000 and $10,000), and \u2018Low' (below $1,000). This results 147 assets in the low-value category, 8,391 in the mid-value range, 673 classified as high-value assets, and 9 identified as extreme-value assets. Subsequently, we opt to disregard extreme-, high-, and low-value assets as outliers, focusing solely on mid-value assets as a more representative set of the data. Following this, we perform normalization of the target price through Min-Max scaling [43, 16], according to the following equation:\n$X_{std} = \\frac{X - X.min(axis = 0)}{X.max(axis = 0) \u2013 X.min(axis = 0)}$\n$X_{scaled} = X_{std} * (max - min) + min$\nFurthermore, motivated from the findings in [18, 48], we expand our analysis by integrating crucial external data, which act as economic indicators [24, 21], including Ether-, Bitcoin-, Crude oil-, Gold-prices and Google trend, which has already been proven to have a significant impact on the NFT marketplace.

The aim is to assess their predictive performance and determine which models are best suited for our dataset. To conduct this evaluation, we randomly divided the dataset into two parts: a training set containing 80% of the parcels and a test set containing remaining 20% parcels.\nAmong the machine learning models applied for regression analysis, we observe that the Extra Trees Regressor, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest Regressor, and Extreme Gradient Boosting consistently exhibit superior performance across multiple metrics, as depicted in Table 4a. Specifically, the Extra Trees Regressor achieves an R2 score of 0.8251, exhibiting the highest level of explanatory power among the models tested. The other ensemble models Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest Regressor, and Extreme Gradient Boosting follow closely with R\u00b2 score of 0.8211, 0.8195, and 0.8151 respectively showcasing their effectiveness in explaining the variance in the target variable. The underlying reason of Extra Trees Regressor performing better as compared to other models lies in its unique approach of randomly selecting subsets of features, leading to increase diversity among trees that helps to reduce variance and overfitting. We also find that Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree gives R\u00b2 score of 0.7364 and 0.6474 respectively that is relatively less than other ensemble models. These models while less susceptible to overfitting, still relies on the sequential addition of weak learners, which does not fully capture the underlying relationships in the data. Conversely, linear models such as Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Bayesian Ridge regression, Elastic Net, and AdaBoost exhibit comparatively poor performance across the evaluated metrics with R2 score lying around 0.36, due to the volatility and non-linearity inherent in our dataset.\nWe also observe a similar trend in the performance of the machine learning based classification approaches, as depicted in Table 4b. Notably, the Extra Trees Classifier stands out with the highest accuracy of 74.23%, and Random Forest Classifier model excel with an accuracy of 73.74%, achieving the highest Recall (81.25%), and F1 score (76.90%). These models indicate their ability to correctly classify instances across different classes while minimizing false positives and false negatives. Despite its slightly lower accuracy of 71.40%, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine exhibits a superior precision at 73.48%. Other models such as Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Decision Tree also demonstrate commendable performance, with accuracies of 71.35%, 66.60%, and 64.46% respectively. Linear models like Adaboost, Ridge, Logistics Regression, and SVM with a linear kernel achieve satisfactory accuracy levels, with varying performances across different metrics.

As we can see in Figure 7a, for regression task, the prices of ether and bitcoin alongside their exchange-rates heavily influence the price of the parcel, thereby underscoring the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market, as highlighted in [18]. In addition, while the attribute 'DistanceToRoad' influences the sale prices of the parcels (Figure 7a), the parcels coordinates (x, y) play a pivotal role in assessing the likelihood of a parcel being resold (Figure 7b), as reported in [5]. Rarity score proves to be a strong predictor in classification task but shows reduced efficacy in regression. Gas prices do not significantly contribute to the price prediction but exhibit notable significance in parcel resale forecasts. Interestingly, google trend, crude oil- and gold-prices also make moderate contributions to both predictions. It is worth mentioning that other geographical proximities, such as 'DistanceToPlaza' and 'DistanceToDistrict', perform poorly in both of the tasks. This could be attributed to most parcels being far from plazas and districts, with a value of 10 as seen in Figure 4, thereby diluting their significance. These findings demonstrate the potential to analyze and predict market trends of Decentraland parcels. With the appropriate data and organization, researchers can gain valuable insights into the usage patterns and operational dynamics of this platform."}, {"title": "7 Discussions and Future Research Scope", "content": "The Metaverse is frequently praised as the Internet's next evolutionary phase, representing a shared digital universe. While the Metaverse is still in its early stage, millions of users have already started interacting with it.

With this surge, recent research attempts revealed insights into the pricing behavior of Decentraland NFTs and how various factors can influence their valuation [14, 19, 53, 36, 15, 44, 39, 29, 32, 8, 5, 33]. However, the existing datasets used in the study, lack details to encapsulate the full spectrum of attributes necessary for analyzing the subtle patterns that could significantly influence parcel sale and user engagement within the Decentraland. This deficiency extends beyond mere scarcity to encompass a lack of depth, breadth, and diversity in the available data sources.\nTo address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive collection of parcel data of Decentraland IITP-VDLand over a span of five years. The dataset is collected from diverse sources, including Decentraland [38], OpenSea [17], Etherscan [50], Google BigQuery [20], Discord [13], Telegram [51], and Reddit [42], facilitating the inclusion of high-dimensional features, comprising characteristics, blockchain information, trading prices, transactions, and social media data. The salient features of our work which makes our dataset distinct from others are as follows: (1) inclusion of a novel attribute, called Rarity score, which measures the uniqueness of a parcel, (2) inclusion of gas-, mining-, and block-specific details of the transactions encompassing various activities (including parcel trading) by leveraging the 'web3.eth' package on Etherscan, (3) considering trading history over a most popular marketplace 'OpenSea', (4) providing a detailed bidding history for off-chain and on-chain, gathered from OpenSea and Etherscan. Furthermore, we also encompass peoples' sentiments about Decentraland parcels across various social media platforms, including Discord, Telegram, and Reddit. To ensure the dataset's efficacy across various disciplines we subdivide our dataset into four category naming it as: (1) Characteristics Data-Fragment (2) OpenSea Trading History Data-Fragment (3) Ethereum Activity Transactions Data-Fragment (4) Social Media Data-Fragment.\nWe envisage that our dataset, covering a broad spectrum of Decentraland parcels, would present a unique opportunity to unearth novel findings and enrich unexamined discoveries of the intricacies within the Decentraland parcels ecosystem. Through our analysis, we observe a notable correlation mirroring real-world scenario, wherein the sale of parcels decreases as the distances from point of interests increases. In addition, our examination also reveals a direct relationship between the volume of activities and number of sales. Aiming to showcase the richness of our dataset that can be used to solve plethora of applications including analysis of transaction costs, market liquidity, variance of gas prices, transaction delays, traders' speculative behaviors, supply and demand dynamics, pricing trends, and market sentiment etc., we limit ourselves as of now with a regression and a classification approach. In particular, we consider more than 20 state-of-the-art machine- and deep-learning models, to assess our prediction. Among all the other models, we observe Extra Trees algorithm achieves the highest R2 score of 82.51% to predict the parcel price and the highest accuracy of 74.23% to predict the probability of parcels being resold. Our results demonstrate the suitability of our dataset for ensemble models over deep learning and linear models revealing the complex nature of our data. We observe that, beside parcels' own features such as coordinates, geographical proximity, rarity score, other economic indicators (such as ether, bitcoin, crude oil, gold prices, google trend) help to increase the predictability as well.\nOur research opens avenues for expansion to additional facets of Decentraland ecosystem, such as avatars, wearables, or other virtual experiences.

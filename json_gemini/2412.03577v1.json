{"title": "OKG: On-the-Fly Keyword Generation in Sponsored Search Advertising", "authors": ["Zhao Wang", "Briti Gangopadhyay", "Mengjie Zhao", "Shingo Takamatsu"], "abstract": "Current keyword decision-making in sponsored search advertising relies on large, static datasets, limiting the ability to automatically set up keywords and adapt to real-time K\u03a1\u0399 metrics and product updates that are essential for effective advertising. In this paper, we propose On-the-fly Keyword Generation (OKG), an LLM agent-based method that dynamically monitors KPI changes and adapts keyword generation in real time, aligning with strategies recommended by advertising platforms. Additionally, we introduce the first publicly accessible dataset containing real keyword data along with its KPIs across diverse domains, providing a valuable resource for future research. Experimental results show that OKG significantly improves keyword adaptability and responsiveness compared to traditional methods. The code for OKG and the dataset are available at https://github.com/sony/okg.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In Sponsored Search Advertising (SSA) (Fain and Pedersen, 2006; Hillard et al., 2010), advertisers bid on keywords that potential customers use in search engine queries when looking for products or services (Google, 2024a). The highest bids and most relevant ads typically secure the best placements, appearing alongside or above search results. This approach targets users at the moment they express interest, increasing the likelihood of them visiting the advertiser's website and making a purchase (Lee et al., 2018).\nThis is where keyword decision in SSA becomes crucial (Google, 2024a). By carefully selecting or generating relevant keywords, advertisers can ensure their ads reach users who are most likely to be interested in their offerings. Effective keyword decision not only boosts the ad's visibility\u00b9 but also enhances its relevance\u00b2, leading to better engagement and higher conversion rates.\nConventionally, keyword decisions for SSA have relied heavily on deep generation-based methods. For instance, (Lee et al., 2018) utilized a conditional GAN (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) to expand queries into bid keywords, while (Lian et al., 2019) employed a seq2seq model (Sutskever, 2014) to generate ad keywords from queries. Recently, significant advancements in LLMs (Achiam et al., 2023; Reid et al., 2024) in knowledge-intensive tasks have sparked new ideas not only in keyword decision but also in other related fields such as information retrieval. (Ziems et al., 2023) used GPT-3 to directly map queries to relevant document identifiers, and (Wang et al., 2024) generated keywords by prompt tuning and a tree-based constrained beam search.\nWhile both deep generation-based methods and LLM-based approaches have significantly advanced keyword generation, they come with notable drawbacks. Firstly, these methods depend on extensive keyword datasets, making them inaccessible to most advertisers who lack such data, especially given the absence of public datasets. Secondly, they fail to address the need for an adaptive, performance-driven approach in the rapidly evolving landscape of search advertising. Since both types of methods rely solely on offline data, they are inherently limited in their ability to monitor and adapt to real-time performance metrics, such as keyword clicks. This lack of real-time feedback creates inefficiencies, as models cannot adjust to performance metrics like clicks and conversions, or to rapidly changing product information. Platforms like Google\u00b3 and ad agencies emphasize the importance of continuously monitoring keyword performances and responding to new data, such as real-time trends in user search habits, product updates, or promotions (e.g., new discounts) (R\u00f6mer et al., 2010). Without this real-time adaptability, models may generate keywords that seem relevant but fail to capture current market conditions, leading to wasted ad spend and a lower return on investment.\nIn this paper, as shown in Fig 1, we propose OKG, an LLM agent-based approach to SSA keyword generation that addresses the limitations of previous methods. Unlike these approaches, OKG continuously learns and evolves by observing the performance of generated keywords in live campaigns, enabling it to dynamically identify trends and optimize keyword selection. The original contributions of OKG are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 OKG leverages real-time information for advertising production, monitors keyword performance, and adapts automatically to changes. This capability allows the agent to judiciously expand the keyword list based on live performance data, ensuring that the keyword strategy evolves with market conditions and campaign insights.\n\u2022 We propose an adaptive keyword generation method within OKG that strategically expands keywords in two dimensions: deeper and wider. The deeper expansion extends existing keyword categories to increase specificity and relevance, while the wider expansion explores new categories to capture diverse user interests and enhance campaign reach. This dual approach diversifies the keyword set while maintaining relevance, dynamically adapting to the evolving advertising landscape.\n\u2022 We present a publicly accessible dataset that includes real-world Japanese keyword data"}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "This section delves into the existing methodologies in SSA keyword generation, critically examining their inherent limitations and the specific challenges they fail to overcome."}, {"title": "2.1 Direct Keyword Generation Using Generative Methods", "content": "This section reviews two key studies that demonstrate how generative methods can directly generate keywords for sponsored search ads, showing how neural models can improve keyword generation.\nUsing GANs for Keyword Generation The first study by (Lee et al., 2018) uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate bid keywords from user queries, focusing on rare queries where traditional methods struggle. They use a sequence-to-sequence model as the generator to produce keywords based on queries, while a recurrent neural network acts as the discriminator to refine the keywords through an adversarial process.\nNMT for Constrained Keyword Retrieval The second study (Lian et al., 2019) applies Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to directly generate keywords from user queries in a search engine context. This end-to-end approach skips traditional steps like query rewriting. They use a Trie-based pruning technique during beam search to ensure that only valid keywords are generated, addressing the need to stay within a specific set of keywords."}, {"title": "2.2 Advancements in Keyword Generation Using Large Language Models", "content": "This section highlights two recent studies using Large Language Models (LLMs) for document and keyword retrieval, showing how LLMs can transform search tasks.\nLLM for Document Retrieval The first study (Ziems et al., 2023) overcomes the limitations of dual-encoder retrievers by using an LLM to directly generate URLs for document retrieval. Instead of encoding questions and documents separately, the LLM generates URLs by deeply interacting with user queries. By using a few Query-URL examples, it successfully retrieves relevant documents, with nearly 90% accuracy in answering open-domain questions.\nLLM for Keyword Generation in Sponsored Search (Wang et al., 2024) presents an LLM-based keyword generation method (LKG) that treats keyword matching as an end-to-end task. Unlike traditional methods that follow a retrieve-judge-rank process, LKG uses multi-match prompt tuning, feedback tuning, and a prefix tree for constrained beam search to generate more accurate keywords."}, {"title": "2.3 Limitations of Current Generative and LLM-Based Approaches", "content": "Despite the advances in using generative and LLM-based methods for keyword generation, there are still key limitations that impact their effectiveness in dynamic search advertising.\nDependence on Large Datasets These methods often rely on access to large, proprietary query-keyword datasets, which are not available to most advertisers. Without these extensive data resources, smaller advertisers are at a disadvantage, as there are no comprehensive public datasets available.\nLimited Real-Time Adaptability Most current approaches use offline data, making it hard for them to adapt to the constantly changing search advertising landscape. This lack of real-time updates means they can't adjust quickly to changes in keyword clicks, conversions, user search behaviors, or market trends. As a result, they may generate keywords that seem relevant but don't fit current conditions, leading to wasted ad spend and poor performance.\nLack of Continuous Monitoring Successful keyword strategies require ongoing monitoring and updates based on new data. Without this flexibility, even the most advanced models may fail to deliver optimal results in the rapidly changing world of digital advertising.\nThese limitations highlight the need for new methods that combine powerful modeling techniques with the ability to respond quickly to real-time data and market shifts."}, {"title": "3 Problem Setting", "content": "The task of OKG is to dynamically generate a fixed number of keywords for each time step $t$ over a time horizon $T$, where $T$ represents the total number of time steps for campaign delivery. Let $K$ denote the cumulative set of all keywords generated by the end of $T$, and let $K_t \\subseteq K$ be the specific set of keywords generated for time step $t$. Then, we have:\n$K = \\bigcup_{t=1}^{T} K_t$\nFor each time step $t$, the keyword generation process is driven by three key factors:\nInformation Sources $(S_t)$: Real-time data reflecting trends, product attributes, and market conditions that may change daily.\nCurrent Keyword Set $(k_t)$: The set of keywords generated and used during time step $t$.\nObserved KPI $(P_t)$: The performance of the keyword set $k_t$, measured by KPIs (e.g., clicks, conversions) as observed from the ad platform.\nThe keyword set for the next time step, $t + 1$, is determined by OKG, denoted as $g(S_t, k_t, P_t)$, which considers the real-time information $S_t$, the current keyword set $k_t$, and its observed performance $P_t$ from time step $t$. Formally, the process is described as:\n$k_{t+1} = g(S_t, k_t, P_t)$\nOKG dynamically adapts the keywords for time step $t + 1$ by analyzing real-time data and adjusting based on the previous time step's performance.\nThe primary goal of OKG-based SSA task is to maximize the total KPI performance over the time horizon $T$, while ensuring that the number of generated keywords per time step remains fixed to optimize budget usage. The objective function is formulated as:\n$\\max_{k_1,k_2,...,k_T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} P_t \\text{ s.t. } |K_t|=n \\forall t$\nwhere $|K_t| = n$ specifies that the size of the keyword set generated at each time step $t$ is fixed to $n$ keywords, which helps control the exploration of new keywords within the advertiser's budget. Typically, advertisers operate under a fixed daily or monthly budget, so it is crucial to manage how many new keywords are explored to avoid overspending on untested keywords."}, {"title": "4 Methodology", "content": "The architecture and workflow of OKG is illustrated in Figure 2. A detailed explanation of the key components is provided below."}, {"title": "4.1 Key Components of OKG", "content": "Planning and Prompting: OKG simplifies keyword generation by eliminating the need for advertisers to gather training data or train models themselves. With just an initial prompt\u2014\u201cYou are the expert in setting Japanese SSA keywords for {product}\u201d\u2014where the {product} placeholder is replaced by the specific item, OKG can automatically generate relevant keywords. This setup allows advertisers to focus on strategic elements of their campaigns, while OKG manages the technical complexities. By leveraging vast offline data, the system quickly produces high-quality keyword sets tailored to the product, reducing the cognitive load for users.\nOKG also features an intelligent planning system, custom-designed to automatically plan the next steps, such as selecting the appropriate tools and identifying which KPIs $(P_t)$ to monitor. Based on the initial input, OKG dynamically adjusts the keyword generation process, ensuring that the system adapts to real-time changes. An example prompt is provided in Appendix C.\nSearch Tool: The search tool (Serp, 2024) used in OKG is responsible for gathering real-time information sources $(S_t)$ from the target domain. This tool retrieves data such as product attributes, current prices, discounts, and user search habits, ensuring that the generated keywords reflect the most up-to-date and accurate market conditions. For example, when generating keywords for \u201cSony Neural Network Console,\u201d the agent retrieves live information about product specifications, pricing, and relevant search queries. This ensures that the keyword generation process is driven by real-time data $(S_t)$, contributing to more effective keyword strategies.\nRetrieve and Memory Module: OKG leverages the Google Ads API (Google, 2024) to automatically gather real-time performance metrics $(P_t)$, such as clicks, conversions, and other KPIs for each keyword. This real-time keyword data with its KPIs are stored in a vector-based long-term memory system (Johnson et al., 2024), allowing for efficient tracking trends in keyword performance. The memory module organizes and stores the historical performance data $(P_{t-1})$ and new keywords generated $(k_t)$, ensuring that OKG can make data-driven decisions for subsequent time steps.\nWhen OKG needs to retrieve specific information to optimize keyword strategies, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) to query the vector-based memory. This allows the agent to automatically access relevant historical data and real-time KPIs $(P_t)$, helping it decide which keywords $(k_t)$ to retain, modify, or generate for the next time step. By continuously updating and retrieving information from the memory, OKG remains adaptive and responsive to changes in the advertising environment, ensuring optimal campaign effectiveness."}, {"title": "4.2 Adaptive Keyword Generation with Calculation Tool", "content": "Adaptive keyword generation is a key component of our OKG-based SSA framework, aiming to dynamically optimize keyword strategies to maximize campaign effectiveness. From $t = 0$, initial keywords are selected to reflect distinct product attributes, targeting various potential customer segments and adapting to market dynamics over time.\nThe keyword generation process is driven by two primary strategies:\nWider Direction $(W_t)$: Exploring and expanding the scope by introducing new categories of keywords to capture potential new users and customer segments, $|W_t|$ represents the number of new categories explored at time step $t$.\nDeeper Direction $(D_t)$: Exploiting and intensifying focus on existing successful keyword categories, prioritizing those that have demonstrated high KPI metrics, $|D_t|$ denotes the number of new keywords generated in the existing categories at time step $t$.\nThe distribution between $W_t$ and $D_t$ is adaptively managed based on real-time performance data. OKG dynamically adjusts keyword generation, balancing exploration and exploitation. The keyword set for the next time step, $k_{t+1}$, is generated as:\n$k_{t+1} = g(S_t, k_t, P_t) = W_t \\cup D_t$\nGiven the fixed size $|K_t = n$, the distribution between $W_t$ (new categories) and $D_t$ (new keywords in existing categories) is determined based on the accumulated KPI from the previous time step $P_{t-1}$. The proportion of keywords allocated to each direction is:\n$|W_t| = \\lceil p_t^W \\cdot |K_t| \\rceil$, $|D_t| = |K_t| - |W_t|$\nThis proportional allocation ensures $|W_t|$ and $|D_t|$ are dynamically adjusted, while maintaining the fixed total $|K_t| = n$. OKG optimizes the balance between exploring new keywords and focusing on high-performing categories, thus aligning keyword sets with emerging trends and proven preferences while controlling budget usage."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": "Dataset. Considering that there are no suitable public benchmarks for training and evaluating keyword generation, we collected and sampled our real dataset from the Google Ad system over a period of six months. The dataset includes real advertisement deliveries for 10 Sony products and IT services: Sony electronic devices like cameras and TVs, Sony financial services including Sony Bank mortgages and health insurance, and Sony AI platforms such as the Sony Neural Network Console and Prediction One. The dataset contains not only the actual delivered keywords but also the performance of each keyword, including search volume, clicks, competitor score, and cost-per-click. The dataset is available at https://github.com/sony/okg\nImplementation Details. We deployed GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) as the LLM backbone for OKG, with the temperature set to 0.1. The final keywords are generated over a time horizon of $T = 3$. At each time step $t$, keywords are adaptively generated by allowing OKG to automatically observe real-time source information and feedback from KPI performance. We chose $T = 3$ for two main reasons: (1) A typical keyword list for one product is capped at around 100 keywords, and three iterations are sufficient to reach this limit while demonstrating the effectiveness of OKG compared to baselines; and (2) the execution time for three iterations is approximately two hours due to the complexity of OKG. As the number of iterations increases, the execution time doubles with each turn, since the keyword list expands with every iteration. OKG is implemented using the Langchain library (Contributors, 2024). All experiments were conducted on a single machine with one NVIDIA V100 GPU and a 24-core Intel Xeon Gold-6271 processor clocked at 2.60 GHz.\nBaselines. We consider the following three types of baselines:\nLLM-based Baselines, including GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) and Gemini-1.5-Pro (Reid et al., 2024), which are proven to be among the most powerful LLM models (Huang et al., 2024).\nJapanese Keyword Extractor-based Baselines, including Choi (Choi, 2024) and RAKE (Rose et al., 2010).\nExisting Commercial Application, including Google Keyword Planner (Google, 2024), as baselines for our comparison."}, {"title": "5.1 Comparison on Keyword Performance", "content": "We evaluate OKG on real keyword KPIs using the following four metrics:\nClick: A higher click count typically indicates greater user engagement, making it a crucial indicator of keyword success.\nSearch Volume: This metric assesses keyword popularity and demand.\nCost Per Click (CPC): The average cost paid for each click on a keyword. CPC is vital for gauging the financial efficiency of keyword strategies, reflecting the cost-effectiveness of each click.\nCompetitor Score: A measure of market competitiveness for a keyword. It considers the number of advertisers bidding on the keyword and the bid amounts, providing a snapshot of the competitive environment.\nThe KPIs are obtained from our public dataset. Generated and original keywords are tokenized and embedded (using pooled embeddings) from a pre-trained multilingual BERT model (Google, 2024b) to measure cosine similarity. For each generated keyword, we select the most similar keyword from offline data (highest similarity score and cosine similarity > 0.6) and use its KPIs to represent the generated keyword's KPIs.\nWe do not include conversion rates or other downstream metrics like Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) in our evaluation, as these metrics are highly influenced by factors beyond keyword performance alone\u2014such as brand reputation, the quality of landing pages, and varying ad spend strategies across industries (e.g., real estate advertisers may prioritize high spending per conversion). These external variables introduce inconsistencies, making it challenging to attribute performance purely to the effectiveness of the keywords themselves."}, {"title": "5.2 Comparison on Online Relevance", "content": "As OKG generates keywords based on online searches and real-time information using search tools, this section evaluates the generated keyword lists to determine their effectiveness in covering the information presented in search results.\nTo accurately measure the coverage and relevance of the generated keywords, we employ several established metrics:\nBLEU-2 (Papineni et al., 2002): to measure the overlap between the generated keywords and the online search results, providing insights into how well the keywords match actual search queries;\nROUGE-1 (Lin, 2004): to focus on recall by comparing the common n-grams between the generated keywords and the target search results, indicating the extent to which our keywords capture the necessary information;\nBERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019): to assess semantic similarity, offering a deeper understanding of how effectively the generated keywords encompass the nuances of the information presented."}, {"title": "5.3 Comparison on Similarity with Offline Real Keywords", "content": "To evaluate the alignment between the generated keywords and real ad delivery data, we employ three key metrics:\nJaccard similarity: to measure the overlap between the generated keyword sets and the real keyword sets, providing a ratio of common keywords to the union of both sets;\nCosine similarity: to assess the vector-based similarity between the generated keywords and real ad keywords, indicating how directionally similar the keyword sets are in the embedding space;\nBERTScore: to evaluate the semantic similarity between the generated keywords and the real ad keywords, offering insights into how closely the meaning of the generated keywords matches the real-world data."}, {"title": "5.4 Ablation Study", "content": "The final experiment consists of an ablation study to assess the impact of various components within the OKG framework.

OKG parses this query to understand the specific requirements\u2014such as the product focus (mortgage services) and the target entity (Sony Bank).\nStep 1: Gathering Current Market Data\nAction: The system performs a Google search to gather the latest relevant information about Sony Bank's mortgage services.\nObservation: It notes the current interest rates, insurance options, and other service features that are critical for keyword relevance.\nStep 2: Benchmarking Against Practices\nAction: OKG queries databases and previous case studies for effective keyword strategies in similar sectors.\nObservation: It identifies key attributes like relevance and specificity, which are crucial for the effectiveness of the keywords.\nStep 3: Analyzing Current Keyword Performance\nAction: The system retrieves and analyzes performance data of existing keywords related to Sony Bank's mortgage services.\nObservation: Keywords are categorized by categories, such as click counts and search volumes.

In recent several years, (Zhang and Qiao, 2018) utilized query logs collected through the Google Keyword Suggestion Tool, focusing on query keywords and query volumes for seed keywords. (Nie et al., 2019) constructed their dataset by crawling Wikipedia, which, while extensive, was confined to the context of content generation and not specific commercial keyword use. (Scholz et al., 2019) documented SSA campaign performances for large-scale online retailers provided by a company with significant online sales, highlighting the commercial and proprietary nature of the dataset. (Zhou et al., 2019) employed 40 million query logs from Sogou.com, with each sample consisting of a keyword and user query pair, reflecting real-world business queries but not publicly available for research. Similarly, (Zhang et al., 2023) analyzed query logs and keyword performance through private datasets that detail interactions but are not accessible to the public. (Wang et al., 2024) generated keyword by prompt tuning and a tree-based constrained beam search based on a private dataset.\nThese cases underline a prevalent issue in the field: a significant reliance on private or business-specific data. The absence of publicly accessible datasets not only hampers the reproducibility of research but also limits the development of SSA keyword generation models that could benefit a wider range of advertisers, particularly those without access to large-scale data repositories. This limitation in data accessibility motivates the development of our OKG, which aims to bridge these gaps by introducing a novel dataset that is both publicly accessible and robust enough to train effective SSA models.\nThe need for publicly accessible datasets is underscored by the growing demand for transparency and reproducibility in machine learning research, as discussed by various scholars and echoed in recent AI ethics guidelines."}, {"title": "C An Example of Generated Keyword by OKG", "content": "In this section, we present an example of keywords generated by our proposed OKG. Starting from initial keywords, we demonstrate how new keywords are generated in each round.\nNote: For readability and to cater to an English-speaking audience, the original generated keywords in Japanese have been translated into English."}, {"title": "C.1 Keywords Generated By OKG", "content": "Initialized Keywords\nFirst Round\nSecond Round\nThird Round"}, {"title": "C.2 Keywords Generated by Baseline Method (GPT-4)", "content": "To compare the effectiveness of OKG, we also generated keywords using GPT-4 as a baseline. Below are the keywords produced by GPT-4 without iterative refinement."}, {"title": "C.3 Analysis: Why OKG-Generated Keywords Are Better than GPT-4", "content": "The comparison between OKG and GPT-4, based on the keyword examples provided in the previous subsection, highlights several important advantages of OKG over GPT-4 in generating more relevant and effective keywords:\n\u2022 Contextual Relevance: OKG-generated keywords are more contextually relevant to the insurance domain and specific to Sony's insurance products. For example, keywords like \"Sony Cancer Insurance\" and \"Sony Insurance Premiums\" directly relate to the advertised products and services. In contrast, GPT-4 produces more generic keywords such as \"Affordable Health Insurance\" and \"Best Health Insurance Options\", which lack specificity and brand alignment, making them less effective for targeted advertising.\n\u2022 Iterative Refinement: OKG's iterative rounds of keyword generation lead to progressively refined keywords. For instance, in the second and third rounds, keywords like \"Sony Insurance Application\" and \"Sony Insurance Premium Comparison\" are introduced, offering more specific search terms based on previously generated keywords. GPT-4, on the other hand, generates a static list of keywords without refinement, lacking the depth and evolution seen in OKG's iterative process.\n\u2022 Balanced Exploration and Exploitation: OKG demonstrates a balance between exploring new categories and deepening existing ones. In the first round, OKG introduces new categories such as \"Insurance Benefits\" and \"Payment Options\", while in later rounds, it refines existing categories with more detailed keywords like \"Sony Insurance Advanced Medical Benefits\" and \"Sony Insurance Monthly Payment\". GPT-4 does not offer this balance; its keywords are limited to broader categories, such as \"Health Insurance Policies\" and \"Corporate Health Benefits\", which may not target niche user intents as effectively.\n\u2022 Targeted User Intent: OKG-generated keywords better align with user intent by including niche and long-tail keywords like \"Sony Insurance Sickness Coverage\" and \"Sony Insurance Hospitalization Insurance\". These terms are likely to attract users specifically searching for Sony's insurance products. GPT-4, in contrast, produces more generic terms like \"Health Insurance Quotes\" and \"Online Health Insurance\", which are too broad to effectively capture the precise needs of the target audience.\n\u2022 Brand-Specific Keywords: A key strength of OKG is its ability to consistently generate brand-specific keywords like \"Sony Insurance\" in every round, which is essential for brand-driven advertising. GPT-4, however, lacks this focus on the Sony brand, producing more general health insurance terms, such as \"Best Medical Insurance Plans\" and \"Health Insurance Discounts\". This brand specificity makes OKG's output far more relevant for campaigns aimed at promoting Sony's products.\nIn summary, the examples show that OKG outperforms GPT-4 by producing more contextually relevant, brand-specific, and refined keywords that evolve over time. OKG's iterative approach and focus on balancing exploration with exploitation allow it to better capture user intent and optimize keyword performance, whereas GPT-4's static, generic output is less suited for targeted, brand-specific advertising."}]}

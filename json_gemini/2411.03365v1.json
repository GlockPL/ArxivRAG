INTRODUCTION", "content": "The advent of the fifth generation (5G) of wireless communication systems has ushered in an unprecedented era of connectivity and innovation. With its promise of higher data rates, reduced latency, and increased capacity, 5G is set to revolutionize various sectors, including smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. Meanwhile, on the other side, it introduces significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in radio frequency (RF) communications, caused by high-density networks with a large number of access points and user equipment (UE). The flexible allocation of spectrum in 5G renders the monitoring and securing channel access more complicated [2]. Among diverse threats, RF jamming attacks emerge as a substantial threat, undermining the reliability and functionality of critical 5G network services that are fundamental to sectors like IoT and autonomous vehicles. For instance, remote surgery and autonomous driving [3], require ultra-reliable low-latency communications, which can be compromised by malicious interference. Unfortunately, traditional network security mechanisms cannot effectively cope with the threats due to multiple factors. The difficulties for traditional methods may include new evolved threats; highly dynamic spectrum access and large-scale networks. Therefore, the variety and sophistication of potential attacks, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and intelligent jamming, necessitate more advanced detection mechanisms.\nIn fact, taking into account the traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the context of 5G's unique demands and threat landscape, the potential challenges to address the RF jamming attacks are detailed as follows. Dynamic spectrum access in 5G networks introduces a layer of complexity where the 5G's spectrum is characterized by its fluidity bandwidths vary, access policies shift frequently, and modulation schemes adapt in real-time [4]. This presents a significant challenge for traditional IDS, which are typically engineered for more static environments. The evolving threat landscape in 5G networks incorporate advanced threats like adaptive jamming and complex advanced persistent threats (APTs) [5]. These modern attacks often do not follow repetitive patterns and are designed to adapt to countermeasures, making them particularly challenging to detect by traditional IDS. The exponential growth in the number of connected devices and network nodes within 5G networks, coupled with the openness and flexibility introduced by the adoption of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, exacerbates these challenges. The open interfaces and disaggregated components in O-RAN can be exploited by attackers, creating vulnerabilities that traditional security methods are not equipped to handle effectively [6].\nTo effectively counter the aforementioned challenges in 5G networks, an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) is paramount. This IDS must be both reactive, to counter known threats, and proactive, to adapt to emerging, unseen attack patterns. Critically, it must achieve this balance while being scalable and resource-efficient, ensuring that the intrinsic performance benefits of 5G are not compromised as the network expands in size and complexity.\nAddressing these requirements, our research proposes a novel IDS framework that synergizes an efficient self-attention mechanism with a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based autoencoder. This combination is strategically chosen to tackle the unique challenges posed by 5G networks. The self-attention mechanism of our solution enables the IDS to adaptively focus on specific spectrum parts more prone to anomalies [7] to enhance its efficacy in safeguarding against spectrum-related vulnerabilities. The integration of unsupervised learning capabilities in the self-attention-equipped RNN autoencoder enables the detection of both known and novel attack patterns. By learning complex dependencies within the data, the model is equipped to identify emerging cyber threats that were not part of its initial training set. The self-attention mechanism computational efficiency translates into the ability for parallel processing, a crucial factor in reducing the computational load. This ensures that the IDS can keep pace with the growing size and complexity of 5G networks, offering robust threat detection without significant resource overheads.\nOur research presents a sophisticated approach to addressing the complex challenges associated with RF intrusion detection in 5G networks. We have developed a model that effectively combines the temporal processing capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with the contextual sensitivity afforded by self-attention mechanisms. This integration results in a robust, efficient, and scalable system. Specifically designed to process and analyze the time-series data characteristic of the RF spectrum, our model excels at identifying anomalies indicative of potential jamming attacks.\nA notable aspect of our work is the deployment of a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) test-bed, along with comprehensive databases, to facilitate the training and inference phases of our model. We have structured a sequential two-part methodology focusing on anomaly detection and subsequent classification. This approach is further bolstered by rigorous experimental validation and an extensive analysis of performance metrics. Our model demonstrates a high proficiency in detecting a diverse range of cyber threats, positioning it as a viable and effective tool for practical application in real-world 5G scenarios.\nThe ensuing sections of this paper will explore the background, methodology, experimental setup, results, and provide a detailed analysis of our proposed model. This comprehensive examination will underscore the model's effectiveness in protecting 5G networks against sophisticated and evolving RF threats, thus showcasing its potential as a critical asset in modern network security frameworks."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are crucial for identifying unauthorized access or anomalies in network traffic, which could indicate a cyber-attack. Traditional IDS tools have been designed to protect network perimeters by monitoring traffic and identifying known attack patterns. However, the dynamic and complex nature of 5G networks requires more adaptive and intelligent IDS solutions. The integration of machine learning techniques with IDS provides the ability to learn from the network behavior and predict potential threats based on anomaly detection [8], [9]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to process sequences of data and retain information over time, making them ideal for analyzing time-dependent network traffic [10].\nThe use of autoencoders in IDS offers a promising approach to anomaly detection. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is trained to copy its input to its output, with the goal of learning a representation (encoding) for the data. In the context of intrusion detection, autoencoders can learn to reconstruct normal network traffic and, by measuring the reconstruction error, can identify anomalies that deviate from the learned pattern [11]. This method is particularly effective in detecting novel or sophisticated attacks that do not match any known signature. The application of autoencoders in 5G networks is especially pertinent due to the high volume and velocity of data, where traditional signature-based IDS tools may fail to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape [12].\nThe deployment of RNN-based autoencoders in 5G networks addresses several challenges associated with the high-speed, high-volume, and low-latency requirements of modern wireless systems. 5G networks are characterized by their use of a diverse spectrum, including millimeter-wave frequencies, which necessitates a more nuanced approach to spectrum monitoring and security [13]. The ability of RNNs to process sequential and time-series data makes them particularly useful for detecting irregularities in the RF spectrum that could indicate jamming or other forms of RF interference. Furthermore, the distributed nature of 5G architecture, with its emphasis on edge computing, calls for distributed IDS solutions that can operate effectively at the network's edge, closer to the user equipment (UE) [14], [15]. Autoencoders and attention mechanisms have seen extensive application and development across various fields, evolving significantly in their design and utility. A comprehensive review [16] delves into the theory, different models, and diverse applications of self-coding neural networks, highlighting their versatility in fields like image classification and natural language processing.\nThe study [17] offers a structured overview of attention models, underlining their importance in enhancing model performance, particularly in classification tasks. Moreover, advancements in self-attention mechanisms, as explored in [18], have shown remarkable improvements in classifier effi-"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The proposed methodology utilizes an autoencoder based on a recurrent neural network (RNN), enhanced with a multihead attention layer, for time-series anomaly detection in 5G networks. This advanced autoencoder is specifically crafted to recognize the IQ data patterns of the network and identify deviations that may signal potential intrusions or malfunctions. The complete architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. We will proceed to dissect and discuss this architecture, focusing on its key components.\n1) RNN Autoencoder Architecture\nAn autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient representations of input data, called encodings, through an unsupervised learning process. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input into a latent-space representation, and the decoder reconstructs the input data from this representation. RNNs are a class of neural networks that exhibit temporal dynamic behavior for a time sequence. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs have recursive connections, allowing them to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs in their internal state. This feature makes RNNs particularly well-suited for modeling time-series data.\nThe RNN-based autoencoder model can be mathematically described as follows:\nEncoder: The encoder part of the RNN processes the input sequence x = (x_1,x_2,...,x_T), where x_t \u2208 R^n is the input at time step t. The hidden state h_t of the RNN at time t is updated by:\n$$h_t = f(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{hx}x_t + b_h)$$\nwhere $$W_{hh}$$ and $$W_{ho}$$ are the weight matrices, $$b_h$$ is the bias vector, and f is a nonlinear activation function, typically a sigmoid or tanh function.\nDecoder: The decoder aims to reconstruct the input sequence from the hidden state. The output \u00eat at time step t is given by:\n$$x_t = g(W_{xh}h_t + b_x)$$\nwhere $$W_{ch}$$ is the weight matrix, $$b_x$$ is the bias vector for the decoder, and g is the activation function, which may differ from f depending on the specific requirements of the input data reconstruction.\nB. Self-Attention in RNN Autoencoder\nThe self-attention mechanism is a transformative approach in neural networks that allows different parts of the input sequence to be weighed differently in terms of their importance or relevance. It is particularly effective in identifying intricate patterns and dependencies in sequential data, such as 5G network traffic. By integrating self-attention into the RNN autoencoder, particularly in the encoder, the model gains an enhanced capacity to focus on significant features of the input sequence, thereby improving anomaly detection capabilities. The whole process, as outlined in the pseudocode of Algorithm 1, encompasses our proposed algorithm. In the following sections, we will delve into a detailed discussion of this process."}, {"title": "IV.

IMPLEMENTATION AND TEST RESULTS", "content": "To establish a robust experimental foundation for intrusion detection in 5G networks, we systematically executed a series of procedures encompassing scenario development, data collection and processing, model architecture selection, and training, followed by the tuning of models and hyperparameters. We then proceeded to the visualization of the model's performance. This methodical approach ensures that each phase of the experiment contributes to a robust validation of the proposed intrusion detection system. We present the details of these procedures as follows.\nA. Scenario Development\nOur research commenced with the development of realistic scenarios that mirror potential adversarial attacks within a 5G network. By designing these scenarios, we aim to create a diverse set of conditions under which the robustness and adaptability of our detection models can be rigorously evaluated. Our attack scenario is shown in Figure 2.\nB. Data Collection and Preparation\nData collection was meticulously carried out to capture a comprehensive range of normal operational patterns from an actively deployed 5G network. Our dataset, now enriched to include approximately 300 million I/Q samples from UE-gNodeB communications, serves as the foundational bedrock for anomaly detection learning. The construction of this dataset was pivotal in mirroring the intricate operational state of a live 5G network, which is essential for the subsequent training of our detection models.\nFor the purpose of testing and validation, adversarial elements were synthetically infused into this dataset to simulate a spectrum of jamming attacks. These attacks, both static and dynamic in nature, were introduced to test the resilience and detection capabilities of our system under realistic interference conditions. The experimental setup, as illustrated in Figure 3, showcases the implemented 5G network configuration complete with the jammer in operation. This setup not only facilitated the generation of a robust dataset reflective of"}, {"title": "VI.

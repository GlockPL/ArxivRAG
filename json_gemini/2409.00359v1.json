Introduction", "content": "In Mexico, gender-based violence is a critical problem that has resulted in the development of numerous strategies to combat and eliminate femicide. Despite these initiatives, the data shows that the incidence of lethal violence against women continues to be deeply concerning. Given this situation, the implementation of mathematical models that enable precise risk evaluation and support timely intervention has become an urgent priority.\n\nThe MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model\u00b9, based on fuzzy logic, emerges as a response to this need, providing a tool that handles uncertainty and variability in data related to gender-based violence. This model has been designed to identify high-risk situations through the mathematical formalization of various rules that correlate specific factors with the probability of femicide. The expansion of the model proposed in this study adds new rules and adjusts the membership functions, thereby improving its predictive capacity and applicability in various contexts.\n\nIncorporating fuzzy logic into the evaluation of femicide risk, by mathematically formalizing elements such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence, enhances the accuracy and adaptability of predicting high-risk scenarios. This approach enables the timely identification of potential femicide cases and strengthens the effectiveness of preventive measures. This raises the question: How does the inclusion of fuzzy logic impact the precision and efficacy of the MFM-FEM- VER-CP-2024 model in forecasting femicide risk in Veracruz, particularly when considering crucial factors like coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence?\n\nThis article seeks to create and implement a mathematical model grounded in fuzzy logic to evaluate and predict the risk of femicide in Veracruz, Mexico. The model incorporates critical theoretical elements such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence. The primary objective is to offer a robust tool for the early detection of high-risk scenarios and to inform the development of preventive measures and intervention public policies.\n\nThe following specific objectives arise from this:\na. To mathematically formalize the risk factors associated with femicide, such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence, using fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and variability in social data.\nb. To develop a three-dimensional representation of femicide risk that integrates multiple factors and rules, using fuzzy logic-based visualizations, to facilitate the identification of critical areas and support decision-making in public policies.\nc. To apply the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model to real case studies in Veracruz, Mexico, to evaluate its effectiveness in identifying and predicting high-risk femicide situations.\n\nThis research, centered on the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model, holds significant theoretical and practical importance in analyzing gender-based violence, specifically in assessing the risk of femicide in Veracruz, Mexico. This model, grounded in fuzzy logic, enables the handling of the complexity and uncertainty inherent in social phenomena, offering a robust mathematical framework for predicting high-risk situations. The integration of key theoretical concepts such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence into the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model underscores its ability to capture the deep dynamics underlying femicide.\n\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, this research contributes to the development of a multidimensional representation of risk, facilitating a more precise understanding of how risk factors interact and"}, {"title": "2. Theoretical Framework", "content": "The theoretical framework of this study draws on several foundational theories that shed light on the underlying dynamics of gender-based violence and femicide. Key among these are the theories of coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence, each of which plays a crucial role in understanding these issues. These theories offer a strong conceptual basis for the creation of the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model and support the application of fuzzy logic to effectively handle the complexity and uncertainty inherent in the data."}, {"title": "2.1. Coercive Control", "content": "Coercive control, as Stark (2007) describes, is a systematic pattern of abuse aimed at complete domination through tactics like emotional manipulation and economic exploitation, gradually eroding the victim's autonomy and trapping them in submission (Kelly & Westmarland, 2016). Johnson (2010) emphasizes that this control is rooted in gendered power imbalances upheld by cultural norms, linking it to broader violence like femicide and highlighting the need for policy interventions (Hamberger et al., 2017). Stark (2007) adds that coercive control's goal is to destroy the victim's freedom through relentless surveillance and emotional manipulation, making psychological abuse equally harmful as physical violence.\n\nWithin the framework of the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model, coercive control is identified as a critical factor that significantly increases the likelihood of femicide.\u00b2 The mathematical formalization of this concept is achieved through membership functions that assess the degree of control exerted by the perpetrator and its impact on the victim's safety. This formalization allows for the incorporation of the variability and complexity of coercive control in risk scenarios, providing a robust tool for predicting and mitigating high-danger situations (Medel Ram\u00edrez, 2024). The model's ability to capture the dynamics of coercive control is crucial, as this form of abuse often underpins relationships that escalate into lethal violence. Recent studies have advocated for combining qualitative and quantitative approaches in modeling the dynamics of coercive control. Westmarland and Kelly (2013) recommend using mixed methods that integrate statistical data with survivor narratives to more effectively capture the complexity of coercive control and its long-term impacts. This methodology has been applied in models like MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 to improve the accuracy and relevance of its predictions.\u00b3\n\nIncorporating survivor testimonies not only deepens the quantitative analysis but also adds a human element, reminding us that each statistic represents a real story of suffering and resilience. The cycle of violence, proposed by Walker (1979), describes a cyclical pattern of tension building, violent"}, {"title": "2.2. Dehumanization Theory", "content": "Dehumanization is a psychological process in which the perpetrator perceives the victim as less than human, enabling the justification of extreme violence, including mutilation, sexual assault, and other cruel acts. Haslam (2006) explains that this process diminishes the victim to a state of inferiority, effectively denying their dignity and rights. In gender-based violence, dehumanization is key to understanding how perpetrators emotionally and morally detach from their actions, allowing them to commit severe acts of cruelty without feeling guilt or remorse, thereby sustaining the cycle of abuse (Kelman, 1973). Recent studies have broadened the understanding of dehumanization, showing that this process not only dehumanizes victims but also strengthens stereotypes and biases that uphold structural violence. Goff, Eberhardt, Williams, and Jackson (2008) point out that dehumanization is deeply ingrained in social and cultural narratives, which can lead to the justification or tolerance of violence against certain groups. In the realm of gender-based violence, women are frequently objectified and dominated, making it easier to perpetrate not only physical and sexual violence but also psychological and economic abuse.\n\nIn the MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model, dehumanization is represented by rules linking extreme violence, such as public humiliation and severe injuries, to a high probability of femicide. These rules are mathematically formalized through membership functions that assess the severity of these acts, effectively incorporating the psychological dimension of dehumanization into femicide prediction and prevention (Medel Ram\u00edrez, 2024). The dehumanization process significantly influences how institutions and society address gender-based violence. Bandura (1999) introduces the concept of \"moral disengagement mechanisms,\" which allow individuals to justify unethical actions by devaluing the humanity of the victim. In gender-based violence, these mechanisms are employed by both perpetrators and institutions, resulting in diminished empathy and insufficient intervention. This can be seen in instances of secondary victimization, where authorities, such as the police or judicial system, treat victims with suspicion or blame, reinforcing cycles of impunity and revictimization.\n\nIn recent years, research has begun to examine how dehumanization affects entire communities and spreads through culture and media. The media often perpetuate dehumanization by portraying victims of gender-based violence in ways that strip them of agency or blame them for the violence they've endured, reinforcing gender stereotypes and normalizing violence against women. The MFM-FEM- VER-CP-2024 model integrates these elements by considering not only physical violence but also symbolic and psychological violence, such as public humiliation, which are crucial in the dehumanization process and in assessing the likelihood of femicide.\n\nThe theory of dehumanization has been used to examine how institutions, like the criminal justice system, frequently fail to protect victims of gender-based violence because they do not fully recognize their humanity. This institutional failure can be viewed as structural dehumanization, where existing policies and practices perpetuate the belief that some lives are less valuable than others. For example, insufficient responses to gender-based violence reports or the tendency to blame victims instead of perpetrators are examples of this structural dehumanization.\n\nIn a recent study, Cikara, Bruneau, and Saxe (2011) investigated how dehumanization affects people's ability to empathize with victims of violence, and how conflict and social division amplify this effect. Their research indicates that dehumanization not only enables violence but also diminishes"}, {"title": "2.3. Cycle of Violence", "content": "Walker (1979) describes the cycle of violence in abusive relationships as a recurring sequence involving phases of tension buildup, violent outbursts, and reconciliation. This pattern is essential for understanding femicide, as the repetition of violent acts can significantly raise the risk of the abuse becoming fatal. The cycle often sees the abuser offering apologies or promises of change after violent episodes, only to fall back into the same pattern. Recent research has expanded on this theory by examining the impact of external factors, such as social support, socioeconomic conditions, and legal interventions, on the cycle of violence. For example, studies show that the presence or absence of external support can influence how long and how intensely the cycle continues, with a lack of support often leading to its perpetuation (Smith, 2019)."}, {"title": "2.4 Fuzzy Logic", "content": "Fuzzy logic, introduced by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1965, tackles uncertainty and ambiguity by employing membership functions. These functions allocate a degree of membership to variables on a scale from 0 to 1. Unlike classical binary logic, fuzzy logic provides a more flexible representation of information, which is especially useful for modeling complex phenomena with unclear boundaries. Membership functions enable a more nuanced and adaptable assessment of femicide risks, aiding in early intervention and prevention efforts. Ross (2016) has furthered the use of fuzzy logic in decision- making and risk analysis, demonstrating its capacity to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data into a cohesive model.\n\nThis approach is especially valuable for assessing femicide risks, where factors often resist precise measurement. For instance, Voskoglou (2023) highlighted fuzzy logic's effectiveness in refining machine learning algorithms and decision-making under uncertain conditions, making it well-suited for addressing complex social issues like gender violence. Moreover, Ridgeway (2017) showed that membership functions can represent varying levels of severity, offering a sophisticated tool for analyzing femicide risk by incorporating multiple factors into a single model. Additionally, Garc\u00eda- Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2020) developed a predictive model using fuzzy logic to improve institutional responses by better handling the ambiguity in abuse reports. Kacprzyk and Pedrycz (2020) explored integrating fuzzy logic with evolutionary computing and big data, expanding its applications in analyzing complex social phenomena. Costa (2022) emphasized fuzzy logic's role in multicriteria decision-making, which is crucial for managing gender violence risks, where decisions often involve evaluating ambiguous or incomplete variables.\n\nIn the context of gender violence, fuzzy logic effectively models factors like psychological abuse, which are difficult to measure precisely. Ridgeway (2017) showed that membership functions can"}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model employs fuzzy logic to assess gender violence risks by representing critical variables like personal relationships and physical violence. This approach enhances the precision and flexibility of risk assessments, thereby improving early intervention and prevention strategies. Additionally, institutional responses and legal measures are emphasized as key components for breaking the cycle of violence and preventing its escalation (Johnson & Dawson, 2020). The model integrates these concepts by applying rules that evaluate the recurrence and intensity of physical violence, directly linking them to the risk of femicide. According to Medel Ram\u00edrez (2024), these rules suggest that frequent, severe episodes of violence significantly increase the likelihood of the conflict escalating to femicide. This study's methodology is based on using fuzzy logic to mathematically formalize risk factors associated with femicide. Fuzzy logic is especially appropriate for this analysis because it can manage the uncertainty and variability present in social data, allowing for the modeling of situations where the boundaries between different risk categories are unclear."}, {"title": "3.1.

For instance, the membership function \u00b5Vf for physical violence ranges from 0 (no violence) to 1 (extreme violence), allowing for nuanced modeling of complex situations with ambiguous variables (Mendel, 2001).

In the 3D space, these interactions manifest as changes in the surfaces representing membership functions, modifying the shape and extent of high-risk regions.\n3. The theoretical configuration of the probability distribution and membership functions is achieved through a fuzzy conceptual framework that integrates multiple variables.

Conclusions", "content": "The MFM-FEM-VER-CP-2024 model, designed to assess femicide risk in Veracruz, Mexico, has proven to be a crucial and powerful tool for addressing gender-based violence. Throughout this study, various theoretical and methodological contributions have underscored the importance of using fuzzy logic and mathematical modeling in preventing extreme violence against women. Notably, the integration of new rules and the adjustment of membership functions within the model have significantly enhanced its predictive capabilities. Fuzzy logic, with its ability to manage the uncertainty and complexity inherent in social phenomena, has allowed for a more accurate capture of the variability in risk factors associated with femicide. This improvement has not only strengthened the model's robustness but also deepened the understanding of the underlying dynamics of gender- based violence.\n\nThe model's theoretical framework, grounded in concepts such as coercive control, dehumanization, and the cycle of violence, provides a solid foundation for understanding how these factors interact to increase femicide risk. For instance, coercive control is mathematically formalized within the model, demonstrating how domination and control by the perpetrator can escalate into lethal violence. Similarly, dehumanization is included as a critical component that justifies the severity of violent acts and their association with a higher likelihood of femicide. These theoretical concepts enrich the model and offer a comprehensive perspective that links theory with the practical prevention of femicide.\n\nThe application of the model to case studies in Mexico has shown that the rules with the highest femicide probability are in regions of the three-dimensional space where risk levels are the highest. These rules, which include factors such as sexual violence, threats, isolation, and public exposure, are visually identified through color coding, facilitating the prioritization of interventions in areas of greatest vulnerability. The model's ability to integrate multiple risk factors and represent them in a three-dimensional space provides a powerful analytical tool that allows researchers and policymakers to focus their efforts on mitigating the most critical risks. Moreover, the validation and adjustment of the model through a complex theoretical approach have proven essential in optimizing its accuracy and applicability in real-world scenarios. The visual and conceptual representation of the results, through three-dimensional graphs that show how variables interact to form risk patterns, has helped identify inconsistencies and drive the continuous improvement of the model. This approach allows for the adjustment of rules and membership functions to more accurately reflect the reality of femicide, ensuring that public policies based on this model are more effective and adaptive.\n\nIn practical terms, the use of fuzzy logic within the model has effectively managed the complexity of data and the nonlinear relationships between variables. This is crucial in femicide risk assessment, where risk factors do not simply add up but interact in complex and often unpredictable ways. The three-dimensional representation of these interactions in the model provides a holistic and nuanced view of risk, which is essential for developing more effective prevention strategies. The MFM-FEM- VER-CP-2024 model has also highlighted the importance of considering variations in initial conditions and how these can alter the probability distribution of femicide. Variations in these conditions, along with interactions between different variables, significantly affect the three- dimensional structure of risk surfaces, influencing both the theoretical and empirical configuration of the model. These observations underscore the need for a dynamic and adaptive approach to femicide risk assessment"}]}

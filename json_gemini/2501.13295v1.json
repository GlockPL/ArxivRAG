{"title": "Parallel Belief Contraction via Order Aggregation", "authors": ["Jake Chandler", "Richard Booth"], "abstract": "The standard \"serial\" (aka \"singleton\") model of belief contraction models the manner in which an agent's corpus of beliefs responds to the removal of a single item of information. One salient extension of this model introduces the idea of \"parallel\" (aka \"package\" or \"multiple\") change, in which an entire set of items of information are simultaneously removed. Existing research on the latter has largely focussed on single-step parallel contraction: understanding the behaviour of beliefs after a single parallel contraction. It has also focussed on generalisations to the parallel case of serial contraction operations whose characteristic properties are extremely weak. Here we consider how to extend serial contraction operations that obey stronger properties. Potentially more importantly, we also consider the iterated case: the behaviour of beliefs after a sequence of parallel contractions. We propose a general method for extending serial iterated belief change operators to handle parallel change based on an n-ary generalisation of Booth & Chandler's TeamQueue binary order aggregators.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The field of belief revision studies the formal rationality constraints that govern the impact of the removal or addition of particular beliefs on an agent's broader world view. The incorporation of new beliefs is modelled by an operation of \"revision\", while the removal of beliefs is modelled by an operation of \"contraction\".\nInitial work in this area was restricted to studying the repercussions of (i) a single episode of change (single-step change), involving the removal or addition of (ii) a single item of information (serial change). In this narrow context, the AGM postulates presented in [1] are widely accepted to provide adequate constraints on both contraction and revision, although belief change operations whose characteristic axioms fall considerably short of full AGM have also been studied extensively, including serial partial meet contraction [1], serial partial meet base contraction [19] and serial kernel contraction [21].\nThe focus was later broadened. Two new aspects were considered: (iii) the behaviour of beliefs under successive changes (iterated change), and (iv) their response to the simultaneous removal or addition of multiple items of information (parallel change). With the exceptions of [12], which focuses on revision, and [30], which tackles contraction, these generalisations have largely been carried out separately, with research focusing either on iterated serial change or on single-step parallel change.\nWork on iterated serial change notably saw the introduction of the postulates of Darwiche & Pearl [11] for iterated serial revision and the postulates of Chopra et al [10] for iterated serial contraction, as well as various strengthenings thereof.\nRegarding single-step parallel change, single-step parallel revision has been plausibly claimed to reduce to single-step serial revision (see [12]). Work on single-step parallel change has therefore focussed on the less obvious case of contraction. For reasons that are not entirely clear, however, the emphasis here has been on extending to the parallel case serial contraction operations that do not satisfy full AGM. We find proposals for partial meet parallel contraction (see [18], [17] and [26]), with an interesting special case studied in [13], [14] and [27]; there also exists an extension to the parallel case of serial kernel contraction (see [15]). In contrast, little attention has been paid to extending fully AGM-compliant operations.\nThis article aims to fill a substantial gap by extending fully AGM-compliant serial contraction not only to the single-step parallel case but to the iterated parallel case as well. It achieves this goal by employing a generalisation to the n-ary case of a binary order aggregation method\u2013\u201cTeamQueue\u201d aggregation-proposed in another context by Booth & Chandler [5]. An axiomatic characterisation of this generalisation is provided, which will be of interest independently of the question of parallel change.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we recapitulate basic notions of serial belief contraction, both single-step and iterated. Section 3 turns to the parallel case, restricting attention to single-step parallel contraction due to the absence of relevant work on the iterated case. There, we show that a particularly plausible approach to this issue, the \u201cintersective\" approach, validates a number of plausible principles due to Furhmann & Hansson's, as well as two further ones that we introduce here. This is an important result, since, collectively, these principles generalise to the parallel case"}, {"title": "Serial belief contraction", "content": "In the standard model of belief change, the beliefs of an agent are represented by a belief state \u03a8. The latter determines a belief set [], a deductively closed set of sentences, drawn from a propositional, truth-functional, finitely-generated language L.

The set of 2n propositional worlds or valuations will be denoted by W, and the set of models of a given sentence A by [A].\nThe core of this model includes two \"serial\" belief change operations, revision * and contraction, both mapping a pair consisting of a state and a single input sentence onto a state. Revision models the incorporation of the input into the agent's beliefs, while contraction models its removal. While earlier discussions of the model focussed on single-step serial belief change, i.e. the change brought about by a single episode of revision or contraction by a single sentence, attention shifted to iterated serial change, involving a succession of episodes of serial revision or contraction."}, {"title": "Single-step serial change", "content": "In the case of single-step serial belief change, it is widely accepted that the AGM postulates, introduced in [1], provide an adequately strong set of rationality constraints.

The last two are known as the \"supplementary\" ones. Analogous principles regulate single-step serial revision. We call a serial contraction operator that satisfies (K1\u00f7)\u2212(K8\u00f7) an AGM contraction operator.\nA principle known as the Harper identity [22] allows us to define single-step serial contraction in terms of single-step serial revision.\n(HI)\n$[\\Psi \\div A] = [\\Psi] \\cap [\\Psi * \\neg A]$\nThe motivation for this principle is straightforward. The idea is that, in contracting by A, we are opening our minds to the possibility that A is false. So we must retract anything that would be no longer endorsed, had one come to believe that this possibility is an actuality. This, however, is the only modification to our prior beliefs that we should make, as we should retract nothing further and introduce nothing new.\nA representation theorem connects contraction operators compliant with the full set of AGM postulates to total pre-orders (TPOs), i.e. reflexive, complete and transitive binary relations, over sets of propositional worlds. More specifically each I can be associated with a TPO \\(\\u0026lt;\\u0026#x263C;\\u0026#x263E;\\) over W, such that min(\\u0026#x211D;\\div A, W) = min(\\u0026#x211D;, W)\\u222a min(\\u0026#x211D;, [\\neg A]) (see [7]).\nThe information conveyed by the TPOs associated with belief states can be equivalently captured by conditional belief sets [\\Psi]$\\rangle$ := {A $\\rangle$ B | B \u2208 [\u03a8 * A]} or again nonmonotonic consequence relations |= {(A, B) | A $\\rangle$ B \u2208 [\u03a8]$\\rangle$}. The AGM postulates ensure that such belief sets or consequence relations are \"rational\" (in the sense of [23]) and \"consistency preserving\" (see [24]).\nThese results mean that the various principles that we shall be discussing can typically be presented in several equivalent alternative formats, where we will use subscripts to distinguish between these, with the non-subscripted version of the name generically referring to the principle regardless of pre-sentation. The names of principles framed in terms of TPOs will be subscripted with $\\<$\\u2081.

While these have been supplemented in various ways, few additions have been uncontested and we shall not be discussing them here. In the case of contraction, supplementary postulates have yielded moderate, priority (see [25]), and restrained (introduced in [9]) contraction operators. But these operations are alike in identifying, for the purposes of belief change, belief states with TPOs, a view criticised in [4].\nThe postulates of Chopra et al can be presented either \"syntactically\" in terms of belief sets or \u201csemantically\" in terms of TPOs.

We briefly recapitulate this contribution here, since it is relevant to what follows. In that paper, it was first noted that the naive suggestion of simply recasting (HI) in terms of conditional belief sets.\n(NiHI) $[\\Psi \\div A]> = [\\Psi]> \\cap [\\Psi * \\neg A]>$\n(equivalently, in terms of non-conditional belief sets: [(\u03a8\u00f7 A) * \u0392] = [\u03a8 * B] \u2229 [(\u03a8 * \u00acA) * B]) is a non-starter: on pains of placing undue restrictions on the space of permissible conditional belief sets, the left-to-right inclusion in the naive suggestion was shown to be jointly inconsistent with several of the AGM postulates for serial revision and contraction.\nA proposal was then made, involving a binary TPO aggregation function , mapping pairs of input TPOs onto a single aggregate output TPO:\n(iHI)\n$\\unlhd_{\\Psi\\div A}=\\oplus \\langle\\unlhd_{\\Psi}, \\unlhd_{\\Psi*\\neg A}\\rangle$\nA family of binary aggregators, the \u201cTeamQueue\u201d (TQ) family, was argued to be appropriate for this job, with one specific member of this family, the \u201cSynchronous TeamQueue\" function STQ, being singled out as particularly promising. It was shown that, when is taken to be a TQ aggregation function, (iHI) allows for the derivation of several important principles, including (HI), which comes out as a special case of (iHI), as well as (C1) to (C4) above, which are derivable from the corresponding Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated serial revision.\nTaking to specifically correspond to \\(\\u2295STQ\\) was argued to yield further desirable theoretical results. In particular, it delivers an appealing syntactic version of (iHI) based on the rational closure Clrat (\u0393) of a set of conditionals \u0393, or equivalently of a non-monotonic consequence relation (see [23]):\n(iHI)\n$[\\Psi \\div A]> = Clrat ([\\Psi]> \\cap [\\Psi * \\neg A]>)$\nIn other words, the conditional belief set obtained after contraction by A corresponds to the rational closure of the intersection of the prior conditional belief set with the conditional belief set obtained after revision by \u00acA. This principle is attractive, due to the fact that Clrat (\u0393) has been argued to correspond to the most conservative way of extending a consequence relation (equivalently: conditional belief set) to a rational consequence relation (equivalently: conditional belief set). (iHI), therefore, parsimoniously fixes the issue noted above in relation to (NiHI), which sometimes resulted in a non-rational conditional belief set. We return to TeamQueue aggregation below, in Section 4."}, {"title": "Background on parallel belief contraction", "content": "While the \"serial\u201d model takes single sentences as inputs for contraction or revision, it has been suggested that this imposes unrealistic limitations on the kind of change that can be modelled. The problem of so-called \u201cparallel\u201d (aka \"package\" or \"multiple\") contraction is to compute the impact, on an agent's beliefs, of the simultaneous removal of a non-empty finite indexed set S = {A1,..., An} of sentences in L (with set of indices I = {1,...,n}). We shall denote parallel contraction by and assume that it subsumes \u00f7 as the special case in which the input is a singleton set, setting [\u03a8 \u0398 {A}] = [\u03a8 \u00f7 A]. We use \\/ S to denote A\u2081 \u039b... \u039b An and \u00acS to denote {\u00acA | A \u2208 S}.\nConsiderations of parsimony motivate defining parallel contraction in terms of serial contraction. Regarding the single-step case, a number of the more straightforward proposals have been noted to be problematic.\nFirst, we have the identification of parallel contraction by a set S with a sequence of serial contractions by the members of S. This runs into problems due to a failure of commutativity (see [20]): different orders of operations can yield different outcomes, and no principled way seems to exist to privilege one order over another.\nSecond, there is the identification of parallel contraction by S with a single serial contraction by some truth functional combination of the members of S (such as the disjunction \\/S of the members of S, so that, for example, \u03a8 \u0398{\u0391, \u0392} = \u03a8 \u00f7 A V B). Certainly, due to the logical closure of belief sets, removing AV B would involve removing both A and B, as contraction by {A, B} requires. However, as pointed out, for instance, in [17], this would be too drastic an operation: clearly, one can simultaneously retract one's commitments both to A and to B without thereby retracting one's commitment to AV B. From this observation, it follows that we cannot generally identify the belief sets [\u03a8\u2295 {A, B}] and [\u00f7AVB] and hence a fortiori, that we cannot generally identify the belief states \u03a8 {A, B} and \u03a8 \u00f7 AV B. Furthermore, more generally, as Fuhrmann notes in [16], there is no truth-functional combination of A and B that would do the job either.\nA more promising solution is the \u201cintersective\" approach, which identifies the belief set obtained by parallel contraction by S with the intersection of the belief sets obtained by serial contraction by the members of S. This proposal has been endorsed by Spohn [30], as it follows from his more general approach to iterated parallel contraction.\n(Int) $[\\Psi\\oplus {A_1, ..., A_n}] = \\cap_{1\\le i\\le n}[\\Psi \\div A_i]$\nThis suggestion owes its plausibility to the same kind of considerations as the formally related Harper Identity did (see Subsection 2.1). In contracting by a set of sentences, the thought goes, we ought not believe anything that any of the individual contractions would preclude us from believing. But this is the only modification to our prior beliefs that we should make. In particular, we should retract nothing further and introduce nothing new.\nBeyond this rationale, we note that (Int) has several further attractive properties. First of all, if one assumes the basic AGM postulates for serial contraction, i.e. (K1\u00f7) to (K6\u00f7), it yields a parallel contraction operator that satisfies plausible generalisations of these:\""}, {"title": "TeamQueue aggregation", "content": "In this section, we offer generalisations to the n-ary case of the construction and characterisation results of the family of binary aggregators studied in [5] and two of their noteworthy special cases.\nThe formal framework involves the following: a finite set of alternatives W, a finite non-empty set of indices I =\n{1,..., n}, a tuple P = \u3008\u4ebai)i\u22081 of TPOs over W known as \"profiles\" and an aggregation function \u2192 mapping all possible profiles onto single TPOs over W. When we shall need to refer to multiple profiles and their constituent relations, we shall use superscripted roman numerals, writing I\u00b9 = {1, ..., n} and P =\u3008\u4eba\u3009i\u22081j. When the identity of P is clear from context, we shall write \u2295 to denote \u2295(P) and x y to denote (x, y) \u2208\u2295, or simply x \\( \\u0026lt;_\\u03A8 \\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;_\\u03A8 \\u0026gt;\\)y.\nAs was mentioned above, TQ aggregation was originally introduced after observing the fact that a particular identity involving the intersection of two conditional belief sets (namely (NiHI)) clashed with the AGM postulates. This result is in fact related to a more general observation, made in [23], that the intersection of two sets of rational conditionals needn't itself be rational.

Let W = {x, y, z, w} and \u4ece1 and 2 be respectively given by: x <1 {w, z} <1 y and z <2 Y <2 X \u4eba2 W.\n(CI) has the consequence that \u2295 isn't a TPO. Indeed,\nmin (1, W) U min(\u22642, W) = {x,z}. So by (CIin), we have zx and x <\u2295 w. On the assumption that is a TPO, this gives us z \u4eba\u2295 w. However, from the fact that min (1, {w, z}) U min(\u22642, {w, z}) = {w, z}, we have, by (CIBin), w z. Contradiction.\nSimilarly, (CI) has the consequence that [<\u2295]> isn't rational. First, from the fact that (x V w) > \u00abw \u2208 [<1]> \u2229 [\u4eba2 ]>, by (CI), we have: (i) (x \u2228 w) > \uff63w\u2208 [\u5c0f]>. Second, from the fact that (x V z) > \u00ab\u2248 \u2209 [2]>, by (CI\u00ae) it follows that :(ii) (x V z) > \u00abz \u2209 [\u00ae]>. Finally, from (w V z) > \u00abw \u2209 [\u22641]>, by the same principle again: (iii) (wVz) > \u00abw \u00a2 [\u5c0f\u2295]>.

It was shown, as a corollary of a key theorem, that the conditional belief set corresponding to the TPO obtained by aggregation of two input TPOs is given by the rational closure of the conditional belief sets corresponding to these input TPOs (see their Theorem 3 and Corollary 1). Here we can report that this theorem and its corollary generalise straightforwardly to the n-ary case. Indeed, we first recall the following definition:\nDefinition 4.

Recall that this property was shown to be equivalent to a property that we called (UB). This second property can be presented in terms of sets of conditionals as stating that the intersection of the sets of conditionals corresponding to the inputs is included in the set of conditionals corresponding to the output:\n(UB)\n$[\\unlhd_{\\oplus}]>[\\unlhd]>$\nTheorem 5, then, tells us that STQ returns the flattest TPO whose corresponding conditional belief set contains the intersection of the conditional belief sets corresponding to the input TPOs. Secondly, we know from Booth & Paris [3] that the rational closure of a set of conditionals corresponds to the flattest TPO that satisfies it. Finally, putting the above two observations together then leaves us with the following immediate corollary:\nCorollary 1. $[\\unlhd_{\\oplus sTQ}]> = Clrat ([\\unlhd_i]>)$"}, {"title": "Parallel contraction via TeamQueue aggregation", "content": "An obvious suggestion is to define iterated parallel contraction in terms of iterated contraction, using TeamQueue aggregation, as follows:\n(Agg)\n$\\unlhd_{\\Psi\\{A_1, ..., A_n\\}}=\\oplus {\\unlhd_{\\Psi\\div A_1},\uff65\uff65\uff65,\\unlhd_{\\Psi\\div A_n}}$"}, {"title": "Concluding comments", "content": "In this paper, we have proposed an original approach to the neglected issue of parallel belief contraction, based on the generalisation of a largely unexplored family of methods for TPO aggregation.\nThe method generalises to the iterated case the \"intersective\" approach to single-step parallel contraction, which we have demonstrated can derive (i) Furhmann and Hansson's parallel versions of the basic AGM postulates for serial contraction and (ii) a pair of new plausible generalisations of the relevant supplementary postulates.\nWhile explicitly regulating two-step parallel change, the approach allows handling indefinitely many parallel contractions when used with serial contraction operators that identify epistemic states with TPOs, such as moderate or priority contraction operators. For models using richer structures than TPOs, such as ordinal intervals [6] or ranking functions (see [29] for an overview, though note that Spohn's proposal does not involve aggregation), a parallel suggestion would require a suitable adaptation of the aggregation method.\nLooking beyond contraction, it would be valuable to investigate whether the TQ approach could be applied to iterated parallel revision. This topic remains under-explored, with the only significant work being [32] and [12] ([28] survey work on the single-step case).\nFinally, there may be applications of TQ aggregation beyond belief revision, as the aggregation of orderings appears in multiple areas. One might consider whether TQ aggregation could show promise in preference or judgment aggregation, as a method for aggregating conditional judgments, preference aggregation, or judgments regarding comparative magnitudes. However, TQ aggregation as presented here would need generalisation for such tasks, as it is currently insensitive to TPO duplication in the profile, meaning profiles with identical members yield the same output. While this property suits parallel iterated belief change, it may not suit these other domains."}]}

Based on the biological principle of Swarm Intelligence and modelled on the decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI has been shown in prior studies to amplify group intelligence, increase group participation, and facilitate productive collaboration among hundreds of participants at once. It works by dividing a large population into a set of small subgroups that are woven together by real-time AI agents called Conversational Surrogates. The present study focuses on the use of a CSI platform called Thinkscape to enable real-time brainstorming and prioritization among groups of 75 networked users. The study employed a variant of a common brainstorming intervention called an Alternative Use Task (AUT) and was designed to compare through subjective feedback, the experience of participants brainstorming using a CSI structure vs brainstorming in a single large chat room. This comparison revealed that participants significantly preferred brainstorming with the CSI structure and reported that it felt (i) more collaborative, (ii) more productive, and (iii) was better at surfacing quality answers. In addition, participants using the CSI structure reported (iv) feeling more ownership and more buy-in in the final answers the group converged on and (v) reported feeling more heard as compared to brainstorming in a traditional text chat environment. Overall, the results suggest that CSI is a very promising AI-facilitated method for brainstorming and prioritization among large-scale, networked human groups.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Humans are not the only species that deliberate in groups to reach decisions. Fish schools, bird flocks, and bee swarms are well known examples of natural groups that reach rapid decisions on life-or-death issues. Biologists refer to this collaborative decision-making process as Swarm Intelligence (SI) and it enables many social organisms to make decisions that are significantly smarter than the individuals could achieve on their own (Krause, et. al, 2010). Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a novel technology developed in 2014 to enable networked groups to quickly reach collaborative decisions as real-time systems modelled after biological swarms (Rosenberg, 2015). ASI has been shown to amplify the accuracy of group decisions across a wide range of applications, from financial projections and sales forecasting to business prioritization and medical diagnosis (Askay, et. al., 2019. Rosenberg, 2016). While ASI is an effective technology, it requires that participants choose among a pre-defined set of options. This works for certain applications such as collaboratively prioritizing predefined sets of options or making numerical estimations or forecasts, but it is not useful for open-ended discussions, brainstorms, deliberations, or debates. To address this, a next- generation technology called Conversational Swarm"}, {"title": "BRAINSTORMING STUDY", "content": "To assess if large networked human groups can hold real-time brainstorming conversations using a CSI structure and converge on a small set of maximally supported solutions, two sets of approximately 75 people (sourced from a commercial sample provider) were assembled in the text-based Thinkscape platform and tasked with a collaborative brainstorming problem. As a baseline, the same groups we also assembled in a single large text-based chatroom of similar real-time functionality to Discord, Slack, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams and other commercial room-based chat environments.\nThe brainstorming task used was a modified version of a typical Alternative Use Task (AUT) that is given to assess creative abilities in individuals and/or groups (Habib, et. al, 2024; Guilford, 1967). In this case, two alternative use tasks were devised \u2013 a first task which asked groups to imagine they work for a large company that has been stuck with a significant inventory of traffic cones. Their task is to come up with as many alternative uses of traffic cones as possible (unrelated to traffic) that could be viable products sold the fictional company and to identify the best ideas among the proposed alternatives. The second task was structured the same way, but the item that the fictional company had in inventory were toilet plungers.\nThe protocol for the first group of 75 individuals was to first brainstorm the traffic cone AUT task first in a single large chat room and then brainstorm the toilet plunger AUT task in a CSI structure in which the 75 individuals were broken up into approximately 15 subgroups of 5 individuals, each sub-group including one Al agent (i.e., conversational surrogate) that participated in the local conversation by sharing ideas received from other subgroups. The second group of 75 performed the same protocol, but brainstormed traffic cones first in the CSI structure, then brainstormed toilet plungers second in a standard large chat room structure. At the conclusion of the intervention, both groups were given a survey in which they were asked a set of subjective judgment questions to compare each brainstorming experience, the single large room versus the CSI structure.\nFor clarity, when using CSI, each participant was only able to converse with the other 4 members of their subgroup and with the Al agent. The Al agents did not introduce any AI generated ideas or opinions into the local conversations \u2013 they only passed and received conversational ideas and opinions from other subgroups, weaving the set of 15 subgroups into a single conversion which individuals could build upon the ideas of others in alternate groups and/or share justifications in support or opposition to ideas across subgroups. In all trials, participants were given 12 minutes to complete each AUT brainstorm task."}, {"title": "DATA AND ANALYSIS", "content": "Each of the two groups of 75 participants took part in a 30-minute session in which they performed two AUT brainstorms for 12 minutes each (one using CSI and one in a traditional chat room) and then individually completed a subjective feedback survey to compare the two experiences. The questions asked on the survey were as follows:\n\u2022 Which method felt more productive?\n\u2022 Which method made you feel more heard?\n\u2022 Which method felt more collaborative?\n\u2022 Which method was surfaced better answers?\n\u2022 Which method made you feel more buy-in?\n\u2022 Which method made you feel more ownership?\n\u2022 Which method did you prefer overall?\nThe only substantive difference between the two groups of participants was that Group 1 brainstormed in a standard chat room first, then used CSI, while the participants of Groups 2 brainstormed using CSI first and then used the standard chat room. This was to mitigate ordering effects on the subjective feedback."}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "In total we collected 147 surveys, each comparing brainstorming and prioritization using a CSI structure versus a traditional chat room. In the CSI structure, the 75 individuals brainstormed by being divided into 15 subgroups of 5 people, each subgroup including an AI agent that participated in their local conversation to link all the subgroups together. In the standard chat room structure, all 75 people were able to see the ideas of everyone else and respond to the full group.\nThe results were highly conclusive, showing that a significant majority of the 147 survey-responding participants preferred the CSI structure to the standard chat room structure in all seven questions asked. To assess if these results were statistically significant, a one-proportion z-test was performed on each question in the surveys to test if the results showed statistically significant evidence that more people preferred one method over the other. Because multiple statistical tests were run, we used a Bonferroni adjustment to determine significance at the 1% alpha level and needed to observe a p- value<0.01/7=0.0014 for each of the 7 questions tested. This level of significance was observed in each of the seven questions, meaning we can conclude with 99% confidence that participants preferred the CSI platform (Thinkscape) for brainstorming and prioritization as compared to traditional text chat."}, {"title": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The results of this study are promising, showing that groups of 75 individuals can successfully brainstorm and prioritize in real-time using a text-based CSI platform. The results further show that participants significantly preferred the CSI structure (which used Al agents to weave together conversations among a large number of small subgroups) over the traditional structure of a single chatroom. In particular, they found the CSI structure to be more productive, more collaborative, and better at surfacing quality answers. In addition, over 80% of participants reported feeling \"more heard\" during the deliberation and came away feeling \"more ownership\u201d and \u201cmore buy-in\u201d with respect to the resulting answers than in a traditional real-time chat environment.\nFuture studies into CSI should aim to evaluate collaborative brainstorming and prioritization among significantly larger groups, aiming to validate usage among hundreds or even thousands of individuals. Considering that the average Fortune 1000 company has over 30,000 employees, the ability to engage very large groups in real-time discussions, brainstorms, debates, evaluations, and prioritizations could be a powerful method for capturing feedback, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and insights, optimizing forecasts, amplifying intelligence, and promoting buy-in and ownership across large organizations.\nFuture studies should also validate the value of CSI in voice chat and video conferencing environments. And finally, future studies should explore the unique usefulness of CSI in vertical applications in which enabling thoughtful deliberation at scale is desired but traditionally hard to achieve. Examples of high-value applications include enterprise collaboration, citizen assemblies, deliberative civic engagement, employee feedback, big science, and consumer research."}]}

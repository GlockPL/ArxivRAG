In settings where each individual is allocated a disjoint share of collective resources, it is a compelling fairness axiom which demands that no individual strictly prefer the allocation of another individual to their own. Unfortunately, in many real-life collective decision-making problems, the goal is to choose a (common) public outcome that is equally applicable to all individuals, and the notion of envy becomes vacuous. Consequently, this literature has avoided studying fairness criteria that focus on individuals feeling a sense of jealousy or resentment towards other individuals (rather than towards the system), missing out on a key aspect of fairness.\nIn this work, we propose a novel fairness criterion, individual harm ratio, which is inspired by envy-freeness but applies to a broad range of collective decision-making settings. Theoretically, we identify minimal conditions under which this criterion and its groupwise extensions can be guaranteed, and study the computational complexity of related problems. Empirically, we conduct experiments with real data to show that our fairness criterion is powerful enough to differentiate between prominent decision-making algorithms for a range of tasks from voting and fair division to participatory budgeting and peer review.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "How to make collective decisions while treating (groups of) individuals in a fair manner is a question that human societies have struggled to understand for centuries. Today, with the advent of algorithms making increasingly critical decisions, the field of algorithmic fairness has considered a plethora of novel fairness criteria [35], albeit they often have limited applicability due to being handcrafted for specialized decision-making tasks. To surpass this limitation, researchers have looked towards computational social choice, a field at the intersection of economics and computer science [22, 27], where fairness criteria applicable to a broad range of domains have been proposed.\nEnvy-freeness [44, 25, 23] is arguably the most well-studied fairness criterion in computational social choice, defined for a general resource allocation setting in which a set of goods M is to be divided between a set of agents N = {1, ..., n}. The goal is to find an allocation A = (A1, ..., An), which is a partition of M, with A\u017c denoting the allocation to agent i. Each agent i has a utility function ui : 2M \u2192 R\u2265o and her utility under allocation A is given by ui(A\u00bf). Envy-freeness demands that no agent strictly prefer the allocation to another agent over her own, i.e., ui(Ai) \u2265"}, {"title": "Our Contributions", "content": "In Section 3, we propose our novel pairwise individual fairness criterion, individual harm ratio (IHR), which is inspired by envy-freeness, makes no interpersonal comparisons, and applies to the full range of the public outcomes model. We observe that in resource allocation with additive utilities, 1-IHR logically implies (and is significantly stronger than) envy-freeness. We also define its groupwise extensions, equal-sized group harm ratio (EGHR) and group harm ratio (GHR); analyze their relations to each other as well as to analogous extensions of envy-freeness in resource allocation [46, 5, 15]; and reconstruct a hierarchy of fairness criteria from resource allocation in the broader public outcomes model.\nIn Section 4, we show that even a group harm ratio (GHR) of 1 (which implies 1-IHR) can be guaranteed in the public outcomes model by maximizing the Nash welfare (geometric mean of agent utilities), when the set of feasible utility vectors U = {(u\u2081(0),..., Un(0)) : 0 \u2208 O} satisfies two mild conditions of compactness and upper convexity. In doing so, we establish an equivalence to proportional fairness and generalize several prior results; see Section 1.2. We also prove that any outcome with a group harm ratio of 1 achieves a (tight) ($[72]$)/\"-approximation at least as good as a 2-approximation of the maximum Nash welfare in any instance of the public outcomes model.

In Appendix A, we provide a technical comparison of our results to those from prior works, and identify exactly which prior results our work subsumes. Here, we briefly summarize four significant implications of our work.\n1. Our work subsumes existing results from the resource allocation literature proving that MNW allocations are envy-free (EF) and Pareto optimal (PO), e.g., in cake-cutting [47, 38] (with our proof being more elementary than the existing ones), or that they are approximately EF and PO, e.g., in one-sided matching [45]. This is a result of 1-IHR implying exact or approximate EF in these domains.\n2. Our work adds to a long line of literature identifying conditions guaranteeing the existence of EF+PO allocations [46, 42, 18] and outcomes satisfying another fairness criterion, proportional fairness [11].\n3. In some domains where our results hold, the fact that MNW allocations satisfy 1-IHR and PO is novel and interesting [16, 13, 9]; in one case, we are able to establish (a previously unknown) existence of EF+PO allocations [16].\n4. Finally, our work significantly expands the possibility of conducting pairwise individual fairness analyses to a much larger set of collective decision-making domains than the resource allocation domains where envy-freeness is well-defined."}, {"title": "Model", "content": "For t \u2208 N, define [t] \u2252 {1, 2, ..., t}.

First, an outcome is proportionally fair if the agents are not happier (in an average multiplicative sense) when switching to any other outcome.\nDefinition 1 (Proportional Fairness (PF)). We say that an outcome o \u2208 is proportionally fair (PF) if \u2211 i\u2208N ui(0')/ui(0) < 1 for all o' \u2208 0.\nA maximum Nash welfare outcome is one that maximizes the geometric mean of agent utilities.\nDefinition 2 (Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW)). Define the Nash welfare of an outcome o\u2208 O as the geometric mean of agent utilities for it: NW(0) = (\u03a0 i\u2208N ui(0))1/n. For a \u2265 1, we say that an outcome o \u2208 O is an a-approximate maximum Nash welfare (MNW) outcome if NW(0) \u2265 (1/a) \u00b7 NW(o') for all o' \u2208 O. When a = 1, we simply refer to it as an MNW outcome.\nAn outcome is in the core [23] if no group can find an alternative outcome that provides all of them weakly higher utility, and at least one of them strictly higher utility, even after scaling their utilities by the size of the group in proportion to the set of all agents.\nDefinition 3 (Core). We say that an outcome o \u2208 O is in the core if there is no group of agents S\u2286 N and outcome o' \u2208 O such that ui(0)/n \u2265 ui(0)/n for all i \u2208 S and at least one inequality is strict.\nProportionality [39] says that each agent should receive at least a 1/n fraction of the utility she can achieve in any outcome.\nDefinition 4 (Proportionality (Prop)). We say that an outcome o\u2208 O is proportional (Prop) if ui(0) \u2265 ui(o') for all o' \u2208 O and all i \u2208 N.\nFinally, the following is traditionally considered a notion of efficiency, but we include it here because it connects well to the notions defined above. An outcome is Pareto optimal if there is no alternative outcome that makes each agent at least as happy and some agent strictly happier."}, {"title": "Private Goods Division", "content": "As demonstrated in the introduction, the public outcomes model subsumes a wide range of collective decision-making models studied in the literature. Below, we formally introduce the special case of private goods division, which we will refer to frequently in our results.\nIn a general private goods division setting, there is a set of goods M to be divided between a set of agents N = [n]. The outcome set O is the set of allocations A = (A1,..., An) which are partitions of M into pairwise-disjoint measurable bundles. Each agent i \u2208 N has a measure ui over M. Crucially, her utility for an allocation A is solely a function of the bundle A\u017c assigned to her, namely ui(Ai).\nThis model captures three prominent settings studied in the literature:\n1. Cake-cutting: M = [0,1] and the utility function ui of each agent i is a (countably additive) measure over M that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\n2. Homogeneous divisible goods: M isa set of m homogeneous divisible goods. An allocation can be described as A = (Ai,g)i\u2208N,g\u2208M with Ai,g being the fraction of good g allocated to agent i and Sien Ai,g = 1 for all g. The utility of each agent i can be given by ui(Ai) =\n\u03a3 g\u2208M Ai,g Vi,g, where vi,g is her value for receiving good g entirely.\n3. Indivisible goods: This is identical to homogeneous divisible goods, except we further restrict Ai,g \u2208 {0,1} for all i \u2208 N and g \u2208 M.\nFor private goods division, additional fairness notions have been extensively studied, but they do not extend to the more general model of public outcomes; coming up with natural extensions of these notions is precisely the subject of our work. Envy-freeness [23] says that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to her own.\nDefinition 6 (Envy-Freeness (EF)). We say that an allocation A is envy-free (EF) if ui(Ai) \u2265 ui(Aj) for all i, j\u2208 N.\nGroup fairness [15] requires that no group of agents should \u201cenvy\u201d(in the sense of being able to Pareto improve by taking the resources allocated to the other group and redistributing amongst themselves, subject to an appropriate scaling factor to account for different-sized groups) any other group of agents.\nDefinition 7 (Group Fairness (GF)). We say that an allocation A is group fair (GF) if there is no pair of groups of agents S,T \u2286 N and a division B of Uj\u2208TAj among agents in S such that |S|/|T|Ui(Bi) \u2265 Ui(Ai) for all i \u2208 S and at least one inequality is strict.\nFor private goods division, envy-freeness implies proportionality, and group fairness implies the core (and therefore also proportionality). Additionally, restricting the group fairness definition to allow only pairs of groups with |S| = |T| yields the group envy-freeness definition of Berliant et al. [5]."}, {"title": "Harm Ratio: A Novel Fairness Criterion", "content": "To motivate the definition of individual harm ratio, let us first revisit envy-freeness (EF) in private goods division with additive utilities (Definition 6): an allocation A is EF if ui(Ai) \u2265 ui(Aj) for all i, j\u2208 N. This is not a utilitarian notion: envy-freeness cannot be checked simply from the induced utility vector (u\u2081(A), ..., Un (A)), which makes it difficult to extend to the public outcomes model. However, if A violates EF, there exists a new allocation A', given by A = A\u00bf \u222a Aj, A'; = 0, and A = Ak for all k \u2208 N \\ {i,j}, which induces a utility vector (u\u2081(A'), ..., Un (A')) satisfying the following: ui(A') > 2\u00b7 ui(A) and uk(A') \u2265 uk(A) for all k \u2208 N \\ {i, j}. This is a purely utilitarian comparison, which can be generalized well beyond private goods division to the public outcomes model. As argued in the introduction, the utility improvement factor of 2 in this case measures the level of harm imposed on agent i due to the presence of agent j. We refer to it as the individual harm ratio (IHR).\nThe factor of 2 is important. Not only does it show up in connection to private goods division with additive utilities, we prove in Theorem 2 that it remains the tightest achievable factor for the more general public outcomes model under certain conditions on the utility set U. It also generalizes well to a factor of ISUT in the groupwise extension of IHR introduced later (Definition 9). However, a worse factor may be achieved when the utilities do not satisfy the requirements of Theorem 2, or a better factor may be achieved in practice on real-world instances. To account for these possibilities, we introduce an a-approximation of IHR.\nDefinition 8 (Individual Harm Ratio). We say that an outcome o \u2208 O has an individual harm ratio of a, denoted a-IHR, if there are no agents i, j \u2208 N and outcome o' \u2208 O such that u\u2081(o') > a\u00b7u\u017c(0) and uk(o') \u2265 uk(0) for all k \u2208 N \\ {i, j}.\nDefinition 8 requires that no agent be able to find an outcome in which even half of her utility is higher (by a factor of a) and at most one other agent is hurt. Intuitively, a large individual harm ratio gives agent i a \"justified claim\" that the system is treating her unfairly due to its attempt to make agent j happy. The higher the a, the stronger the claim. Conversely, the lower the value of a for an outcome, the stronger its fairness guarantee."}, {"title": "Comparison to Envy-Freeness and Proportionality", "content": "Consider private goods division with additive utilities. From the argument above, it is clear that 1-IHR implies envy-freeness, but in fact, it is strictly stronger: even if moving the goods allocated to agent j to agent i does not suffice to more than double agent i's utility, a complete reshuffling that also alters the allocations to the other agents may nonetheless be able to achieve this, while still keeping the other agents at least as happy. The next result shows that envy-freeness is much weaker than 1-IHR, as it implies only (n/2)-IHR.\nTheorem 1.

Hence,"}, {"title": "Groupwise Extension", "content": "Example 1 points out a weakness of IHR in the public outcomes model. Finding an outcome that hurts at most one other agent can be quite limiting if there are no such alternative outcomes.\nWhat if we allow an agent (or a group of agents) to find outcomes that hurt multiple other agents? This must be accompanied with a greater requirement of utility improvement. It turns out we can strengthen IHR to group harm ratio (GHR) in the same way that envy-freeness is strengthened to group fairness (GF) in private goods division [15].\nDefinition 9 (Group Harm Ratio). We say that an outcome o\u2208 O has a group harm ratio of a, denoted a-GHR, if there are no non-empty groups of agents S,T \u2286 N and outcome o' \u2208 O such that the following two conditions hold:\n1.

Proportionality cannot be guaranteed in the standard example of allocating\nan indivisible item between two agents who value it at 1 (U = {(1,0), (0,1)}). An MNW outcome is not guaranteed to exist if x \u2208 [0,1) fraction of a single homogeneous divisible good must be allocated to a single agent with utility x for receiving a fraction of the good (U = {x : x \u2208 [0,1)}); in particular, since the agent is not allowed to receive the whole good, a Nash welfare arbitrarily close to 1 can be attained but a Nash welfare of 1 cannot be attained. Nonexistence of the other properties follows from the implications in Proposition 1.\nIn this section, we show that even proportional fairness, which implies a group harm ratio of 1, can be guaranteed when the utility set U satisfies two simple conditions:\n\u2022 Compactness: U is compact.\n\u2022 Upper convexity: For any x, y \u2208 U and a \u2208 [0,1], there is z \u2208 U such that zi axi +\n(1 \u2212 a) yi for all i \u2208 N.\nCompactness and convexity (where even z = a \u2022 x + (1 \u2212 a) \u00b7 y \u2208 U is guaranteed) of the utility set is a common feature of many decision-making models. Compactness of U holds whenever the outcome set O is compact and the utility functions ui are continuous. Convexity of U holds whenever the outcome set O is the set of probability distributions (over some set) and one uses expected utilities [48]. In resource allocation contexts, it also holds for the richer class of concave utilities [6, Proposition 1]. The celebrated result of Dubins and Spanier [19] establishes compactness and convexity of the utility set for cake-cutting.\nUpper convexity is a slightly relaxed version of convexity, which allows convexity to fail as long as there is a utility vector that Pareto dominates the one obtained from a convex combination. Intuitively, this relaxed requirement should not cause any issues because one should always be able to switch to such a Pareto dominating outcome, although a priori it is not clear if such an outcome would retain any fairness guarantees. Upper convexity is a useful relaxation.\nExample 2. Consider allocating a single homogeneous divisible good between two agents. The outcome set is the simplex O = {(X1,X2) : X1, X2 \u2265 0, X1 + x2 = 1}. Suppose the agents have utility functions that are linearly increasing in the fraction of resource that they receive, but plateau when at least half of the resource is allocated to them. That is, u\u2081((x1,x2)) = min(0.5,x1) and\nu2((x1,x2)) = min(0.5, 12). We have (0.5,0) \u2208 U and (0,0.5) \u2208 U, but (0.25,0.25) \u2209 U. Upper convexity is still satisfied due to the fact that (0.5,0.5) \u2208 U, which Pareto dominates (0.25, 0.25).\nFinally, it is worth noting that when U is compact, an MNW outcome is guaranteed to exist because the product is a continuous function, which attains a maximum over a compact set via Weierstrass' extreme value theorem. Similarly, when U is compact and upper convex, a proportional outcome is guaranteed to exist. For each agent i, let \u00e6\u00b2 \u2208 arg max\u00e6\u2208u xi be a utility vector with the highest utility for agent i (compactness ensures that the maximum is attained in U). Upper convexity guarantees the existence of a utility vector that (weakly) Pareto dominates (1/n) \u03a3ien x\u00b2, and this is proportional by definition. Note that because this outcome has a strictly positive Nash welfare, so must any MNW outcome (so it must give a positive utility to each agent).\nProposition 3. When U is compact, an MNW outcome exists. When U is compact and upper convex, a proportional outcome exists and every MNW outcome has a strictly positive Nash welfare.\nHowever, the existence of a proportionally fair (PF) outcome or even an outcome in the core is not trivial to establish even under compactness and upper convexity of U. The next result shows that under these conditions, every MNW outcome (which exists by Proposition 3) is PF, making MNW and PF equivalent due to Proposition 1 and yielding the existence of PF. Combining this with Proposition 2, we get a 1-GHR (and thus a 1-IHR) implication as well.\nTheorem 2. Consider any instance of the public outcomes model where the utility set U is compact and upper convex. A maximum Nash welfare (MNW) outcome exists, and every MNW outcome is proportionally fair (PF). Consequently, MNW and PF are equivalent, and every MNW outcome has a group harm ratio (and thus an individual harm ratio) of 1.\nProof. The existence of an MNW outcome is due to Proposition 3. Let o\u2208 O be any MNW outcome. Suppose for contradiction that it is not PF. Then, there exists an outcome o' \u2208 O such that\nDefine a function f : (0, 1] \u2192 R such that for a \u2208 (0,1],\nNote that this is well-defined because ui(0) > 0 for all agents i \u2208 N (Proposition 3) and a > 0, implying that the first term inside the logarithm is strictly positive (and the second term is weakly positive since a \u2264 1 and u\u017c(o') > 0). Note that f(1) = log NW(o).\nNext, we prove that that there exists a \u2208 (0,1) such that f(a) > f(1). Since f is differentiable in a, it suffices to show that the left-derivative of f at a = 1 is strictly negative. It is easy to see that"}, {"title": "Computation", "content": "Having established that MNW (equivalently, PF) outcomes are 1-GHR, and thus 1-IHR, under quite general conditions (Theorem 2), we now examine the question of computation. We are interested in two computational questions: checking whether a given outcome is 1-IHR and computing an outcome with a low individual harm ratio (ideally, 1).\nFor the special case of homogeneous divisible goods with additive utilities, an MNW/PF solu- tion can be found in strongly polynomial time [34]. However, in general, exact polynomial time computation is not possible. We instead turn to approximate solutions.\nDefinition 10 (a-Proportional Fairness). An outcome o \u2208 C is a-Proportionally Fair (a-PF) if 1/n \u03a3 i\u2208N ui(0')/ui(0) < a for all o' \u2208 C.\nWhen the utility space U is convex and can be described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, as is the case for common settings such as public decision making [14], and budget- feasible participatory budgeting [20] (in all cases, assuming fractional solutions are allowed), a (1 +\n\u20ac)-PF outcome can be computed in time polynomial in the input size and 1/e using standard convex programming techniques. However, approximate PF is interesting only insofar as it guarantees some approximation of other, normative, properties. Our most general of these is GHR.\nBy slightly adapting the proof of Proposition 2, it is easy to see that approximate PF implies approximate GHR.\nProposition 4. In the public outcomes model, (1 + \u0454)-PF \u21d2 (1 + ne)-GHR for every \u0454 \u2265 0.\nProof. Fix any \u0454 \u2265 0. Suppose o \u2208 O is (1 + \u20ac)-PF but violates (1 + ne)-GHR. Then there exist non-empty S, T C N and outcome d' e O such that |S|/|SUT|ui(d') \u2265 (1 + ne)uz(0) for all i \u2208 S, and ui(0') \u2265 ui(0) for all i \u2208 N \\ (SUT). If u\u00bf(0) = 0 for any i \u2208 N, then o clearly violates (1 + \u20ac)-PF, which is the desired contradiction.\nAssume that ui(0) > 0 for all i \u2208 N. Then we have\ncontradicting that o is (1 + \u20ac)-PF.\nOf course, our results have not ruled out the possibility of computing an exactly 1-IHR, or even a 1-GHR, outcome in polynomial time; perhaps this can be done more directly without having to appeal to (approximate) proportional fairness. We leave these as open questions.\nWith respect to checking whether a given outcome o\u2208 O is 1-IHR (i.e., has a individual harm ratio of 1), whenever the feasible utility space U can be described by a polynomial number of linear constraints, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. To do so, we solve a linear feasibility program for every pair of agents i,j to check if there exists x \u2208 U for which xi > 2\u00b7 ui(0) and Xk \u2265 uk(0) for all k \u2208 N \\ {i, j}, which is a single linear program.\nIndivisible goods. An interesting special case is that of indivisible goods allocation with additive utilities. Here, it is known that a 1-IHR outcome cannot be guaranteed. For the case of two agents, we know that EF and 1-IHR are equivalent (Theorem 1), and it is known via a standard reduction from the Partition problem that determining the existence of an EF outcome is NP-complete even with two agents.\nCorollary 1. For indivisible goods allocation with additive utilities, checking if a 1-IHR outcome exists is NP-complete.\nLastly, we show that it is hard to check whether a given allocation of indivisible goods is 1-IHR. This is in sharp contrast with checking envy-freeness, which can be done easily by comparing the utility of every agent with their value for every other agent's allocation.\nTheorem 4. For indivisible goods allocation with additive utilities, checking if a given outcome is 1-IHR is coNP-complete.\nProof. First, note that membership in coNP holds since an outcome o can be certified to not be 1-IHR by providing an alternative outcome o' and two agents i, j for which the violating conditions in Definition 8 hold.\nTo show coNP-completeness, we reduce from the 3-Partition problem: Given a multiset C of 3d numbers c1, ..., C3d lying strictly between 1/4 and 1/2, can C be partitioned into d triplets C1,\nCa such that the sum of the members of each triplet is 1?"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "In this section, we validate our theoretical definitions by running numerical simulations on data from three real-world settings: private goods allocation, peer review, and participatory budgeting. Consistent with real-world constraints in these settings, we require that solutions be discrete.

Our approach will be to evaluate the individual and group harm ratios of prominent rules for these settings.\nAs a minimal requirement, our definition should differentiate between rules across a wide range of settings, since the practical consequence of any fairness definition is limited to those cases where it can make a specific recommendation. Second, in settings where well-established and validated fairness notions already exist, we would like IHR to align well with those existing notions.\nOur first setting is that of indivisible private goods allocation. Every agent i has a value vi,g for every good g, with valuations normalized so that \u2211g Vi,g is independent of i.\nDatasets. We use two synthetic and one real datasets. For the synthetic ones, we first consider agent valuations drawn from a uniform multinomial distribution (i.e., randomly dividing 200 points between m goods) and, second, valuations drawn from a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The Dirichlet-multinomial can be thought of as first drawing an underlying \u201cmarket value\u201d for every good from a uniform Dirichlet distribution, and then drawing agent valuations from a multinomial distribution whose expectations equal to the market values, thus correlating agent valuations.

The Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) [10] maximizes the utilitarian welfare, and we also include the Nash welfare-maximizing assignment and the PeerReview4All (PR4A) [40] algorithm, which is a heuristic algorithm for the leximin solution, which maximizes the minimum utility (egalitarian welfare) and, subject to that, maximizes the second-minimum, and so on. We also compare the Core-Based Reviewer Assignment (COBRA) algorithm of Aziz et al. [3], which computes a reviewer assignment that lies in the core, and an appropriate adaptation of the round robin rule. In the constrained setting of peer review, round robin works by letting agents choose a single reviewer in a cyclic fashion according to some fixed order, subject to their choice of reviewer leaving at least one feasible reviewer assignment remaining that is consistent with earlier choices.\nMeasurements. For the peer review setting the standard definition of envy does not make sense, since the reviewers allocated to paper j may not be allowed to be allocated to paper i (in particular, if the author of paper i is a reviewer for paper j). Denoting j's \"bundle\" of assigned reviewers by Aj, it might be the case that ui(Aj) is undefined. To avoid this issue, we consider a modified notion of envy ratio that we term the shuffle envy ratio.

Theorem 2 goes through with the usual weighted extensions of MNW (arg max, \u03a0i\u2208N ui(o)Wi) and PF (max, \u2211 i\u2208N wi ui(0')/ui(0) < 1),"}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": "Simpler proof of envy-free and Pareto optimal cake-cutting.

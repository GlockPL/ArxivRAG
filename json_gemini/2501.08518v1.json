{"title": "EASING SEASICKNESS THROUGH ATTENTION REDIRECTION\nWITH A MINDFULNESS-BASED BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE", "authors": ["Xiaoyu Bao", "Kailin Xu", "Jiawei Zhu", "Haiyun Huang", "Kangning Li", "Qiyun Huang", "Yuanqing Li"], "abstract": "Seasickness is a prevalent issue that adversely impacts both passenger experiences and the opera-\ntional efficiency of maritime crews. While techniques that redirect attention have proven effective\nin alleviating motion sickness symptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to\nmanage seasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion environment\nassociated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a mindfulness brain-computer interface\n(BCI), specifically designed to redirect attention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms\nin real-world settings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal elec-\ntroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices\nfor the assessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time feedback as\nmindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in attentional focus from physiological\ndiscomfort to mindfulness practices. A total of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime\nexperiment consisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting session, and a\npseudofeedback mindfulness session. Notably, 81.39% of participants reported that the mindfulness\nBCI intervention was effective, and there was a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness,\nas measured by the Misery Scale (MISC). Furthermore, EEG analysis revealed a decrease in the\ntheta/beta ratio, corresponding with the alleviation of seasickness symptoms. A decrease in overall\nEEG band power during the real-feedback mindfulness session suggests that the mindfulness BCI\nfosters a more tranquil and downregulated state of brain activity. Together, this study presents a novel\nnonpharmacological, portable, and effective approach for seasickness intervention, with the potential\nto enhance the cruising experience for both passengers and crews.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The motions of a vessel at sea can elicit symptoms of motion sickness, commonly referred to as seasickness, which\npresents considerable challenges for both individuals working and traveling onboard such vessels. Seasickness not\nonly leads to increased energy expenditure but also exacerbates fatigue and drowsiness, particularly during prolonged\nvoyages and in the case of adverse sea conditions. Data collected from surveys conducted across various vessels\nunderscore the substantial impact of seasickness. Reports indicate that approximately 64% of inexperienced passengers\nexperience seasickness during a 2-to-3-day cruise, and this percentage can reach 60% among all passengers, including\nseasoned crew members, under extreme conditions [1, 2]. Remarkably, in the case of rough sea conditions, the incidence\nof seasickness can reach a staggering 100% [3]. Furthermore, seasickness poses a grave threat to the operational\nperformance of military personnel. In amphibious naval exercises, the prevalence of seasickness can reach 62.5%, and\nfor naval medical personnel engaged in distant sea missions, the rate of seasickness can reach as high as 72.35% [4, 5].\nTherefore, the development of effective methods to address seasickness is a critical task.\nSeasickness, a subtype of motion sickness, is triggered primarily by a discrepancy between the sensory information\nperceived by the eyes/ears and the vestibular (inner ear) signals related to motion, leading to confusion in the brain and\nsubsequent symptoms [6]. Pharmacological interventions for motion sickness aim to alleviate symptoms by targeting\nthe neural pathways involved in the motion response of the vestibular system. Medications such as dimenhydrinate,\npromethazine, cyclizine, and scopolamine work by inhibiting specific receptors in the brain that transmit signals related\nto motion and nausea. These medications have efficacy rates ranging from 62% to 78% [7, 8, 9]. However, the use of\nthese medications is limited owing to their substantial side effects, such as headaches, xerostomia (dry mouth), fatigue,\ndizziness, and blurred vision [8, 10]. These side effects not only diminish individual comfort but may also impair\ncognitive functions, thereby negatively impacting the operational performance of maritime personnel. Furthermore,\nin maritime settings where medical supplies can be limited and difficult to procure, the reliance on these medications\nbecomes problematic. Certain medications are subject to stringent restrictions in naval contexts owing to their associated\nhigh-risk profiles, further complicating their use [11]. Consequently, there is increasing interest in the exploration and\ndevelopment of nonpharmacological alternatives for managing seasickness, particularly interventions that are safe,\naccessible, easy to implement and not reliant on scarce medical resources.\nA promising and widely utilized nonpharmacological method for managing motion sickness is attention redirection.\nThis method involves shifting one's attentional focus from the internal sensations of movement and nausea to external\nvisual stimuli or engaging activities, thereby mitigating the discrepancy between visual and vestibular inputs and\nalleviating symptoms [12, 13]. Attention redirection can be implemented through various means, including listening\nto music [14, 15], regulating breathing patterns [14, 16], and performing mental arithmetic tasks [17]. Owing to their\nsimplicity and practicality, attention redirection approaches have been widely adopted across various environments\ninvolving induced motion. However, attention redirection methods may not be equally effective for seasickness because\nof several factors. First, the continuous and intense motion of a boat in turbulent water, characterized by shaking,\nrolling, and pitching, can significantly impair the ability of an individual to concentrate on external visual cues or\nengage in activities [18, 19]. The brain's natural response to such intense motion is to prioritize maintaining balance\nand stability, with limited cognitive capacity available for attention redirection. Second, unlike other environments with\ninduced motion, in which many external visual cues or distractions may be present, limited external stimuli may be\navailable in maritime environments, especially during long voyages on the open sea. This lack of external focal points"}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "This section presents the results of experiments exploring the use of mindfulness BCI techniques for alleviating\nseasickness, along with the corresponding EEG patterns observed.\nWe use a single electrode headband to capture and amplify prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are\nwirelessly transmitted to computing devices for mindfulness assessment. Users receive feedback through mindfulness\nscores and 2D/3D audiovisual feedback, offering real-time insights into their mindfulness state to improve focus and\nengagement in the meditation task. A group of 43 individuals participated in three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness\nstate (RMS), a pseudofeedback mindfulness meditation state (PMS), and a resting state (RS)."}, {"title": "2.1 Mindfulness BCI effectively alleviates seasickness", "content": "Upon completing the real-world trials involving the RMS, RS, and PMS, the participants evaluated the effectiveness\nof the mindfulness BCI in mitigating seasickness in both the RMS and PMS using a 7-point Likert scale (Fig. 1a).\nA majority of the participants (35 out of 43, 81.39%), indicated that the mindfulness BCI significantly reduced their\nseasickness in the RMS (Fig. 1a). Conversely, in the PMS, a majority of the participants (n=30, 69.77%) reported no\nseasickness relief (Fig. 1a). The evaluations in the RMS and PMS revealed a statistically significant difference between\nthe symptoms in the two states (two-tailed, paired t(42) = -6.816, P < 0.001, Cohen's d = \u22121.039).\nWe then examined the impact of the mindfulness BCI system in alleviating seasickness symptoms in three 90-minute\nsessions. A statistically significant interaction effect was observed between state and time (F(18) = 4.205, P < 0.001).\nThe main effects analysis revealed that the MISC score was significantly affected by both time (F(9) = 10.593, P <\n0.001) and state (F(2) = 9.168, P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed that initially, at 0 minutes, there was no\ndifference in the MISC scores between the RMS and RS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = -1.934, P = 0.137, FDR-\ncorrected). However, starting from the 20th minute, the MISC scores in the RMS were significantly lower than those in\nthe RS were (two-tailed, paired t test, P < 0.05 every 10 minutes, FDR-corrected). Therefore, starting from the 20th\nminute in the two 90-minute sea trials, participants reported a significant reduction in the severity of seasickness in the\nRMS compared with that in the RS. Moreover, the increase in the MISC score over time was significantly mitigated by\nthe use of the mindfulness BCI.\nThe MISC scores were subsequently averaged across the RMS, the RS and the PMS. As presented in Fig. 1c, the\naverage MISC score in the RMS was significantly lower than those in the RS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = -4.128, P <\n0.001, Cohen's d = \u22120.044, FDR-corrected) and PMS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = -3.785, P < 0.001, Cohen's\nd = -0.0448, FDR-corrected).

A significant difference (two-tailed,\nt(19.501) = -3.174, P < 0.01, Cohen's d = \u22121.315) in the relative MISC scores was found between the participants\nin group 1 (mean = 1.35, s.e.m. = 0.479) and group 2 (mean = 3.85, s.e.m. = 0.625), with individuals in group 2\nshowing greater alleviation of seasickness symptoms compared with those in the RS. These results suggest that the\nmindfulness BCI is particularly beneficial for individuals who are more susceptible to seasickness."}, {"title": "2.3 EEG signature of seasickness: Prefrontal beta relative power", "content": "As shown in Fig. 3a, comprehensive power spectrum analysis was performed across the RMS, RS, and PMS, revealing\nthat the spectrum was significantly lower in the RMS than in the RS and PMS across the entire frequency range (1\u201340\nHz) (cluster-level statistical permutation test with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz, each frequency point P < 0.001).\nTheta power [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and beta power [37, 38, 39, 40] have been preliminarily linked to motion sickness\nin several previous studies conducted in simulated laboratory environments. We analyzed the EEG data collected during\nreal-world sea trials and discovered that the prefrontal beta power ratio relative to the baseline, termed the prefrontal\nbeta relative power, was significantly lower in the RMS than in the RS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = \u22122.504, P < 0.05,\nCohen's d = -0.382, FDR-corrected), as shown in Fig. 3b.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the average mindfulness scores for participants in the RMS\nindicate notable decreases at the initial moment and at the beginning of every 10-minute interval, aligning with\nthe start of meditation triggered by a modified audiovisual context. As shown in Fig. 4b, the mindfulness score\nin the RMS was significantly higher than that in the RS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = 10.671, P < 0.001, Cohen's\nd = 1.627, FDR-corrected) and PMS (two-tailed, paired t(42) = 7.146, P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.090, FDR-\ncorrected).

Furthermore, our\nresults revealed a reduction in the overall EEG band power during the RMS compared with those in both the RS and\nthe PMS, suggesting that the participants experienced a more tranquil physiological state when the mindfulness BCI\nwas used. Moreover, we observed a decrease in the theta/beta ratio, an indicator of attentional focus, when seasickness\nsymptoms were alleviated through the mindfulness BCI. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the\nefficacy of the mindfulness BCI for seasickness alleviation that is consistent with attention redirection and sensory\nconflict theory.\nPrevious studies on car sickness have suggested that redirecting attention away from the discomfort associated with\nmotion sickness to other objects or tasks can reduce the brain's awareness of such pain [12, 13]. However, attention\nredirection methods may not be equally effective for alleviating seasickness. Car movement is mainly 2-dimensional,\nbut ships are subject to considerable vertical movement due to swells [18, 19], resulting in 3-dimensional movement,\nwhich may be associated with more complex sensory inputs, leading to additional sensory conflict and more severe\nmotion sickness than that experienced in cars. In this case, the complex sensory inputs compete with attention resources,\nmaking attention redirection more challenging [45]."}, {"title": "4 Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "4.1 Mindfulness BCI", "content": "The proposed Mindfulness BCI consists of three parts: a BCI headband (iHNNK, Inc.), a computing terminal, and\nmindfulness software. The BCI headband is a single-channel EEG collection device with electrodes positioned above\nthe right frontal lobe and reference and ground electrodes positioned at the temples. The electrodes are constructed\nfrom hydrogels, which leave no residue on the user's head, reducing the preparation and cleaning time compared with\nthe use of traditional conductive gels. The headband is portable, as it connects wirelessly to the computing terminal\nusing a Bluetooth module and is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery.\nThe computing terminal was a Lenovo\u00ae Xiaoxin Pad Pro 12.7\". The tablet was run with an Android\u00ae system and was\nequipped with Snapdragon\u00ae 870 SoC. The screen resolution was 2944\u00d71840, with a refresh rate of 144 Hz. The tablet\ncould receive brainwaves transmitted from the BCI headband. Additionally, the tablet was used to implement the CNN\nmodel to calculate the mindfulness scores and provided audiovisual feedback on the basis of the mindfulness scores.\nThe EEG data from the headband is input into the mindfulness software, which is used to compute mindfulness scores,\nranging from 0 to 100, in real time. Specifically, one EEG signal was extracted each second with a 10-second sliding\nwindow in real time. For each 10-second EEG signal, a filter group with 35 filters was applied to filter the signal\nbetween 0.1 Hz and 70.1 Hz every 2 Hz. Then, for a specific EEG epoch, the time-frequency features were calculated\nusing the Hilbert transformation [56]. Afterward, the extracted time-frequency feature matrix was z score normalized\nand fed into a pretrained CNN model. The framework of the cross-subject CNN is shown in Fig. 5. In the first layer, 32\n3 \u00d7 3 kernels with a stride of 1 are applied to the input feature matrix. This is followed by a max pooling layer with a\n3 \u00d7 3 pool size and a stride of 2. The resulting features are then input into a multiscale convolution module with 4\nbranches with distinct receptive fields. Padding is used to preserve the feature dimension. Then, the features from all\nbranches are concatenated, passed to a 3 \u00d7 3 max pooling layer (stride of 2), and flattened into a vector. This vector is\nprocessed with a dropout layer with a 0.5 dropout rate before being passed to a fully connected layer with a kernel size\nof 100. Classification is performed via a softmax layer to produce a mindfulness score, which represents the probability\nof the mindfulness state. The ReLU activation function is utilized in all the layers except the output layer. These scores\nreflect the user's mindfulness meditation state, with higher values indicating increased relaxation and concentration.\nThe mindfulness software displays meditation scenes as audiovisual stimuli, and the properties of these stimuli can\nbe altered according to the mindfulness score. The audio materials consist of two elements: meditation guidance and\nbackground sounds. The volume of the meditation guidance is independent of the change in the mindfulness score\nand can be manually adjusted by the user. The changes in the background sounds correspond to the mindfulness\nscore. When the score is higher, the sounds are louder and vice versa. The visual materials used differ according\nto the mindfulness score. Specifically, in these scenes, the elements are organized in encouraging and discouraging\nsettings. In scenes involving elements such as candles or camp fires, when the mindfulness score is low, the flame is\nweak, and the background is dark. As the score increases, the flame becomes stronger, with a glowing light present in\nthe background. In natural scenes such as deserts, the scene shifts from a withered tree in a sandstorm to a blooming\ntree in an oasis surrounded by butterflies as the mindfulness score increases. The participants were instructed of the\nrelationship between the mindfulness score and the scene appearance, which helps them adjust their mindfulness state\nwith the assistance of the meditation scenes."}, {"title": "4.2 Questionnaires", "content": "In the experiments, the participants evaluated their levels of seasickness using the Chinese version of the MISC table, as\ndetailed in Table 1[30].

The scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, categorizes symptoms into five\nlevels. A score of 0 indicates no issues, a score of 1 denotes discomfort without particular symptoms, scores from\n2 to 5 correspond to symptoms with four increasing severity levels (vague, little, rather, and severe) without nausea,\nscores from 6 to 9 indicate symptoms with four increasing severity levels with nausea, and a score of 10 signifies\nvomiting.

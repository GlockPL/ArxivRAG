It involves real-time data acquisition, analysis, and processing, along with the application of intelligent algorithms and control systems. These aid companies in optimizing resource allocation, enhancing production quality, lowering production costs, expediting product innovation and delivery, and fostering sustainable development. Intelligent manufacturing integrates cloud computing (Xu, 2012), the Internet of Things (IoT) (Lu and Cecil, 2016), artificial intelligence (AI) (Li et al., 2018), big data (Li et al., 2015), and other emerging technologies. This integration enables the sharing of manufacturing resources and capabilities globally, forming a comprehensive intelligent manufacturing cloud service platform (Li et al., 2010). In an intelligent manufacturing cloud service platform, resource service providers release virtual manufacturing resource services. These services are centralized under the management of the cloud platform, forming cloud services (Gao et al., 2023). Enterprise customers submit manufacturing tasks to the intelligent manufacturing platform. The platform decomposes tasks based on complexity and selects suitable cloud services from the candidate pool. These services are combined into a chain of cloud service composition to fulfill user manufacturing tasks (Liu et al., 2023).\nCloud service optimization involves using intelligent algorithms to select the optimal service composition from numerous cloud services based on specific requirements, conditions, and constraints. The goal is to meet user needs, enhance system performance, reduce costs, and improve user experience (Wu et al., 2013). This process includes operations such as selecting, combining, configuring, and scheduling cloud services to deliver optimal solutions. As a crucial component of intelligent manufacturing, cloud service optimization offers technical support by intelligently selecting and configuring diverse cloud service resources. It enables enterprises to maximize the use of cloud services for intelligent manufacturing, thereby enhancing production efficiency and product quality.\nIntelligent Manufacturing Cloud Service Composition and Optimal Selection (IMfg-CSCOS) faces a series of complex issues, including cloud service providers, service models, optimization of resource service quality, etc. It requires careful selection of cloud services that meet customer needs. Additionally, factors such as service performance, reliability, security, and data privacy need to be thoroughly considered in the selection process. Meanwhile, research on cloud service optimization for intelligent manufacturing not only concerns the benefits of enterprises but also influences the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in the market. Efficient cloud service composition solutions can substantially reduce customer costs and enhance satisfaction. However, inappropriate service composition solutions may affect customer satisfaction and limit the development of the intelligent manufacturing cloud platform. It is evident that IMfg-CSCOS is the key for traditional manufacturing to transition to intelligent manufacturing.\nThe goal of this review is to summarize IMfg-CSCOS research, covering selected source literature, the classification and canonical definition of existing optimization indicators, the classification and introduction of optimization algorithms, research"}, {"title": "2 IMfg-CSCOS Process", "content": "Intelligent manufacturing, as a new model, centralizes dispersed manufacturing resources using internet technology. It utilizes IoT, AI, cloud computing, and other technologies to encapsulate dispersed manufacturing resources into modules. These modules are then placed onto an intelligent manufacturing cloud platform for unified management. IMfg-CSCOS involves three participants: service providers, service demanders, and intelligent manufacturing platform operators. Service providers contribute distributed resources, which are encapsulated into manufacturing services on the intelligent manufacturing platform. Service demanders submit manufacturing requirements to the intelligent manufacturing platform, which in turn conducts cloud service optimization for the service demander. Intelligent manufacturing tasks can be categorized as single function and multifunction based on complexity. Single-function tasks are accomplished with a single service, whereas multifunctional tasks require decomposition into subtasks. These subtasks are completed by combining multiple heterogeneous manufacturing resources.\nGiven that tasks in real-world applications are typically more intricate, this paper focuses on the more extensively studied multifunctional tasks. Multifunctional manufacturing tasks have four types of structures: sequential, parallel, selective, and circular (Liu et al., 2017). Sequential structure implies a unidirectional relationship between subtasks, executed in a specific order. Parallel structure involves the simultaneous execution of multiple unconstrained subtasks. Selection structures denote the presence of substitutions between specific subtasks, with the probability of each subtask occurring (Yuan et al., 2020). Circular structures incorporate loops in the subtask execution, requiring iterative execution. Zhou and Yao (2017a) demonstrated that parallel, selective, and circular structures can be simplified or transformed into the sequential model.\nAfter determining the structure of the cloud service preference task, the intelligent manufacturing platform can optimize services based on this structure.  Using customer order O as an example, the IMfg-CSCOS process can be described as follows: the customer order, O, is decomposed into a series of tasks, T. If T is a multifunctional task, it continues to be decomposed into single-function subtasks, ST. After that, services are searched based on the functional requirements of each subtask ST; to identify services that satisfy the subtasks' quality of service (QoS) requirements, forming the candidate set of services for the subtasks. Finally, the optimal service composition is constructed by selecting services from the set of candidate services. The specific steps are as follows:"}, {"title": "3 IMfg-CSCOS Objectives", "content": "By reviewing the relevant literature and research outcomes, we have found that existing studies on IMfg-CSCOS predominantly concentrate on optimization objectives and diverse algorithms. These investigations have evolved from singular goals like cost and time optimization to multifaceted objectives such as reliability, quality, and reputation. Moreover, there has been a shift from the initial use of heuristic algorithms to the recent incorporation of advanced methods, notably reinforcement learning (RL). The research progress of IMfg-CSCOS is outlined below.\nIn establishing the canonical definition of optimization objectives, we analyzed 90 papers statistically. These articles were gathered through searches in the Web of Science and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using keywords such as cloud manufacturing, service composition, and manufacturing services. After excluding 12 articles that did not specify a particular optimization objective, we were left with 78 papers. Addressing the sustainable development of cloud platforms, we identified 11 high-frequency optimization objectives. Based on the roles of participants in intelligent manufacturing activities, these objectives were categorized into three groups: those related to service demanders, service providers, and cloud platforms. The specific statistical results are presented in Table 1.\nReferring to Table 1, the main objectives for cloud service optimization are cost and time, with secondary considerations given to reliability, quality, and reputation. Other factors such as availability, maintainability, load balancing, and energy come afterward.\nIn the current literature on IMfg-CSCOS, there are inconsistencies in the definition of the 11 optimization objectives mentioned above, hindering the progress of IMfg-CSCOS research. The varied terms and definitions used by different researchers introduce ambiguity to the same concepts, making the literature challenging to read and comprehend. Moreover, it diminishes the reproducibility and comparability of studies. To tackle this issue, we have provided a standardized definition for these 11 optimization objectives.\nFor the mentioned optimization objectives, let us consider an intelligent manufacturing cloud platform with D users (d represents the d-th user) and P service providers (p represents the p-th service provider) concurrently. Each user can request T tasks from the platform, and each task comprises J subtasks. Since the three structures (parallel, selective, and circular) can be simplified or transformed into the sequential model (Zhou and Yao, 2017a), we only consider the sequential structure to define the above 11 optimization objectives using functions.\nFor analytical convenience, the following constraints should also be fulfilled:\n(1) Tasks are independent of each other and share the same priority.\n(2) Tasks are decomposed into subtasks based on requirements.\n(3) Each subtask can be processed by at least one service.\n(4) A service provider can offer different types of services, with each capable of performing a maximum of one subtask at a time.\n(5) Subtasks cannot be interrupted until they are completed.\nFor descriptive purposes, notations were defined as shown in Table 2."}, {"title": "4 Service Optimization Methods", "content": "The IMfg-CSCOS problem fundamentally constitutes a composition optimization challenge. An intelligent manufacturing platform harbors a substantial and irregular array of cloud services, embodying a quintessential nondeterministic polynomial time-hardness problem. In response to such intricacies, intelligent algorithms have emerged as prevalent tools for effective resolution in academic contexts (Yao et al., 2021). In the initial phases of research, heuristic algorithms were extensively applied in the domain of IMfg-CSCOS owing to their straightforward principles, applicability, and broad relevance. As machine learning and RL have progressed, intelligent"}, {"title": "4.1 Heuristic Optimization Algorithms", "content": "Heuristic algorithms represent computational approaches for addressing intricate optimization problems, providing practical solutions within a reasonable temporal and spatial framework. In contrast to conventional mathematical methods, heuristic algorithms prioritize exploration within the domain of approximate solutions, facilitating the swift identification of improved outcomes.\nThe heuristic algorithm workflow is illustrated in Figure 2. Initially, it is essential to define the solution, objective function, and the corresponding value of the problem. Subsequently, the problem is modeled, as outlined in Algorithm 1.\nIn the current stage of research, heuristic algorithms are predominantly characterized by imitating natural biological processes. Widely employed heuristic algorithms encompass genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1992), particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995a) algorithms, and chaotic optimization algorithm. Additionally, there is utilization of the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) (Mirjalili and Lewis, 2016), ant colony optimization (ACO) (Dorigo, 1992) algorithms, artificial bee colony (ABC) (Lucic and Teodorovic, 2002) algorithm, simulated annealing (SA) (Kirkpatrick, 1984) algorithm, and others. The classification of heuristic algorithms is based on problem-solving approaches, distinguishing between swarm algorithms, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), physical optimization algorithms, and hybrid algorithms (Houssein et al., 2021).\nSwarm algorithms (Beni and Wang, 1993) draw inspiration from the collective and cooperative behaviors observed in various species, such as ants, birds, and bees, where individuals work together in groups to find and collect food. Prominent swarm heuristic algorithms encompass ACO, PSO, ABC, and the emerging WOA. For instance, the ACO algorithm emulates the behavior of ants that release pheromones along their foraging routes. The concentration of pheromones serves as an indicator of path dis-tance, where higher concentrations correlate with shorter paths. Cao et al. (2016)"}, {"title": "4.2 RL-based Optimization Algorithms", "content": "RL is a learning paradigm that establishes a mapping from environmental states to actions, with the objective of enabling the agent to accumulate the maximum reward throughout its interactions with the environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998). The foundational principle of RL centers on learning through a process of trial and error, which unfolds in two distinct steps. First, the agent engages with a specific environment, interacting to perceive outcomes such as receiving rewards or penalties. Subsequently, the agent assimilates the outcomes of its interactions with the environment, developing its optimization strategy. The objective of this strategy is to maximize rewards while minimizing penalties, analogous to the instincts of animals to avoid harm. Consequently, RL embodies a goal-oriented learning paradigm reliant on interactive experiences. As depicted in Figure 4, a typical RL model encompasses five primary elements: agent, environment, state, action, and reward. In the RL process, the agent evaluates the current environment and decides on an action (a \u2208 action) based on its strategy, leading to a transition from the current state (St) to the next state (St+1). Simultaneously, the agent receives an environmental reward (Rt). This iterative process persists until convergence.\nRL incorporates the foundational structure of dynamic programming and Markov decision processes. It proves particularly valuable in addressing sequential optimization problems, such as cloud service optimization, offering the following advantages:"}, {"title": "4.3 Additional Optimization Algorithms", "content": "In addition to the aforementioned optimization algorithms, numerous other noteworthy algorithms have been proposed by researchers to address the challenge of cloud service optimization. Within the cloud platform, a multitude of manufacturing services with comparable functionalities but varying service qualities exist. These services undergo comprehensive evaluation, and the most suitable services are recommended to customers while ensuring satisfaction of service demands. Liu et al. (2023) introduced a similarity-enhanced hybrid group recommendation approach for cloud manufacturing. The algorithm initially categorizes users based on a similarity measure, followed by constructing a weighted sorted aggregation model to generate a recommendation list derived from representative users in each user group. Ma et al. (2014) acknowledged that users possess distinct preferences for manufacturing service attributes. They extracted attribute weights from a vast dataset of historical records using variable-precision rough set theory mining. Subsequently, a combined ranking was determined by calculating the product of each service attribute value vector and the attribute weight vector. The Euclidean distance was then computed with the vector of service attribute values preferred by the user to obtain the combined ranking. Jiang et al. (2020) proposed a combined weight assignment method that integrates hierarchical"}, {"title": "5 Research Hot Topics", "content": "To address the IMfg-CSCOS problem effectively, enhancing the service quality of manufacturing tasks requires a comprehensive and multiplicative understanding of the cloud service composition challenge.

However, the current research results still require further exploration, primarily encompassing the following aspects:\n(1) Insufficient consideration of the interests of both service providers and intelligent manufacturing platforms. Current research predominantly focuses on cloud service optimization from the perspective of service demanders, overlooking the interests of service providers and intelligent manufacturing platforms. The first consid-eration is that service providers, functioning as significant manufacturing enterprises, must generate sufficient profit to sustain their survival. If prioritizing user interests results in an imbalance in the interests of service providers, significantly limiting the revenue potential for certain manufacturing service providers and demotivating them, it becomes necessary to consider the alignment of interests from the perspective of"}]}

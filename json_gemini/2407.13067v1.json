However, traditional forms of support are often inaccessible due to the high costs and complex coordination. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in providing human-like dialogues that could emulate social support. Yet, in-depth, in situ investigations of LLMs to support behavior change remain underexplored. We conducted two randomized experiments to assess the impact of LLM agents on user engagement with mindfulness exercises. First, a single-session study, involved 502 crowdworkers; second, a three-week study, included 54 participants. We explored two types of LLM agents: one providing information and another facilitating self-reflection. Both agents enhanced users' intentions to practice mindfulness. However, only the information-providing LLM, featuring a friendly persona, significantly improved engagement with the exercises. Our findings suggest that specific LLM agents may bridge the social support gap in digital health interventions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Changing behavior to improve wellness is challenging, even when the potential benefits are obvious [21, 131, 132]. For example, people are often motivated to participate in traditional yoga classes, try meditation routines discovered in books or magazines, participate in community-led mindfulness sessions, or explore wellness exercises on digital platforms such as Instagram and YouTube. However, forming habits and following through with these exercises proves to be a significant hurdle [136, 199]. This lack of perseverance can be attributed to several factors, including lack of accountability and the struggle to overcome ambivalence [21, 89, 90]. Nevertheless, there is evidence that social support can contribute to the success of behavior change initiatives by increasing accountability, motivation, and emotional sustenance [5, 19, 109, 137, 145].\nThe 'Supportive Accountability' model proposed by Mohr et al. [135] suggests that digital health promotion tools are more likely to be effective when complemented by human support. This support goes beyond simple companionship, incorporating benevolence, relevant expertise, and tailored guidance. An example could be a coach that provides information, scaffolding the learning process with factual and procedural knowledge [135, 161]. On the other hand, there can be support that operates through inquiry and reflection, which encourages users to engage in self-exploration and critical thinking about their behaviors and underlying motivations [93, 182]. Integrating social and expertise-based support into technology may facilitate long-term behavioral change. However, traditional forms of support are inaccessible to many due to the costs and complexities of providing support [3]. Human support is often the most expensive and complex part of a digital health intervention [10, 106, 134]. Some people also have preferences not to interact directly with others or lack existing supportive relationships that can be leveraged to support new practices.\nRecently, advances in deep learning have led to the development of LLMs such as GPT-4 [2, 26]. These models are large neural networks trained on vast collections of textual data, enabling them to process inputs in natural language and generate human-like text. Conversations, essential for providing social support among humans, can now be convincingly mimicked by LLM-based conversational agents, simulating the personalized and open-ended dimensions of human-to-human interactions that, until now, have been challenging to achieve in automated conversation systems [129, 164, 176]. LLMs have potential to play a multifaceted role in helping individuals achieve behavior change. Although significant research has explored social support in various contexts, less is known about the effectiveness of LLM-based agents for long-term behavior change in ecologically valid settings [176].\nOur research draws from existing CSCW and social support literature to understand the role of LLM-based agents in providing social support to adopt wellness practices [3, 109, 133]. Specifically, we focus on evaluating the impact of LLM agents on two key aspects: the users' intention to participate in wellness exercises and their actual engagement with these exercises. We also gather user perspectives on the support provided by LLM agents to understand how people think about collaborating with LLM agents around behavior change. We address the following research questions.\nRQ1 (Intention to Practice Exercises): How do LLM agents influence users' intention to engage with wellness exercises?\nRQ2 (Engagement with Exercises): What impact do LLM agents have on the actual engagement with wellness exercises, as indicated by the initiation and completion rates of exercises?\nRQ3 (Measures of Well-being): What impact do LLM agents have on immediate and long-term well-being measures (such as stress and mindfulness scores) related to wellness exercises?\nWe focus on mindfulness as a case study, a practice increasingly recognized for its extensive benefits in improving mental health, reducing stress, improving emotional regulation, and fostering overall well-being [107, 113, 142, 179]. A popular method of learning mindfulness is through tutorial videos. This approach allows people to learn about mindfulness and practice it at their own pace and convenience. However, despite the accessibility and flexibility of these self-guided mindfulness programs, they often face challenges with attrition. Studies have shown that consistent engagement in such self-directed mindfulness interventions can be challenging, and many participants do not complete the programs [13, 162, 190]. Estimates suggest that 23-39% people drop out within 10 weeks of the program [114].\nThere is an opportunity to enhance engagement with self-directed wellness practices through additional social support. The nature of this social support can vary to meet individual needs at any point in the behavior change process [130]. Informational support and validation can play crucial"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Our work builds on long-standing research on influencing engagement in behavior change interventions, the role of social support in maintaining this engagement, technology-enabled mindfulness, conversational agents, and the growing literature on the interaction between humans and LLMs."}, {"title": "2.1 User Engagement in Behavior Change Interventions", "content": "Ensuring sustained engagement with behavior change tools is crucial for their effectiveness [87, 199]. Most behavior change interventions, especially those delivered through the digital medium without human support, suffer from high dropout and attrition [53, 94, 199]. Engagement alone may not directly result in behavior change, but it serves as an essential precondition [68, 87, 199]. In an era marked by fragmented attention, distractions, and shifting priorities, a key challenge is designing technologies that maintain user interest without contributing to the noise of daily life [44, 70, 180]. Karapanos [87] proposed the use of \u2018Creating checking habits' powered by instant information rewards, similar to those in social media updates and emails. Although there is a risk that these habits could lead to addictive behaviors [67, 87], they also promise to foster beneficial engagement, such as encouraging more frequent exercise through interactions with the app.\nGouveia et al. [66] explored how behavior-change applications might create checking habits by continuously updating their feedback, similar to strategies employed in the computer-gaming and airline industries. This continuous update could maintain the informational reward from app checking, which is believed to be a primary driver behind the formation of checking habits. Furthermore, enhancing engagement through social interactions, which we cover in the following subsection, could be another strategy to sustain engagement. Erickson and Kellogg's [52] concept of \u201cSocial Translucence\u201d suggests shifting the responsibility of behavior change to families and social ties, promoting awareness of each other's behaviors through technology, rather than relying solely on the technology's persuasive capabilities. This shift towards social awareness and nudging within personal relationships could lead to a more sustainable change in behavior [12, 88, 135].\nBehavior change is a broad concept that can capture changes in how individuals prevent or manage health conditions, and their day-to-day practices and habits that have implications for general well-being. Here, we focus on the latter, considering the specific context of in initiating and sustaining mindfulness practice."}, {"title": "2.2 Social Support in Wellness Behavior Change Journeys", "content": "Social support is essential in influencing health behaviors and outcomes, acting as a cornerstone of physical and mental well-being [109, 181]. Studies, such as those conducted by Tay et al. [178], have highlighted the multifaceted benefits of social relationships, highlighting their importance in chronic illness self-management and mitigating suicidal tendencies. The expanding research in this field has led to diverse conceptualizations and operational frameworks for social support, reflecting its complexity and the variety of forms it can take [75, 116].\nBarrera and Ainlay [11] provided a comprehensive classification of social support into six categories, including: Material Aid, signifying the provision of tangible resources like money or goods; Behavioral Assistance, which involves sharing tasks or providing physical labor; Intimate Interaction, encompassing traditional counseling behaviors such as listening and expressing empathy; Guidance, offering advice or information; Feedback, providing insights into an individual's behavior, thoughts, or feelings; and Positive Social Interaction, facilitating leisure and relaxation through"}, {"title": "2.3 Technology-Enabled Mindfulness", "content": "The HCI and CSCW literature has extensively explored the role of technology in supporting meditation to practice mindfulness [179]. Technology serves as a valuable tool, allowing users to practice in their own time and space and aiding users in achieving and sustaining focus on inner or outer experiences, such as breathing [146, 148], tactile movements [80, 158], or even monitoring brain activity [96, 97, 159]. These techniques encompass a spectrum of applications, including Virtual Reality (VR), wearables, and online interventions. Wearable devices have been investigated for their role in mindfulness practice, with a focus on monitoring biometrics using integrated sensors. Research has explored sensor placement options like the thumb, head, or infraclavicular locations to determine the most sensitive accelerometer location for measuring body motion during short meditation sessions [156]. Additionally, MeditAid, a headset providing binaural feedback for enhancing meditative states [159], and the MindfulWatch, which tracks real-time breathing patterns during meditation using smartwatch technology [71], have emerged. These wearables extend to wrist-worn devices that can distinguish meditation periods by analyzing heart rate variability [6, 35]. In workplace settings, brain-sensing wearable devices like the MUSE-S\u2122 have been utilized for guided meditation sessions to reduce stress [64].\nWhile wearable devices, including VR head-mounted units, show promise in various applications, their reach among diverse users in daily contexts, particularly those new to mindfulness seeking accessible entry points, remains limited. Conversely, numerous online programs and applications have been developed to promote mindfulness practices, leveraging the convenience of smart-phones, tablets, and desktop systems for personal use. These apps offer various features, including guided audio meditations, daily mindfulness activities, and training programs. For instance, apps offering guided audio meditations were associated with reduced blood pressure and significant"}, {"title": "2.4 Conversational Agents for Behavioral Interventions", "content": "Conversational agents, or chatbots, have been increasingly deployed in various domains to positively influence user behavior, from improving sleep habits [154] and offering psychiatric counseling [144] to promoting healthier diets, exercise routines [78], smoking cessation [30], and other health-related behavior change. Lukoff et al. [118] introduced a chat-based food journaling tool to help families achieve their healthy eating goals, exemplifying the utility of chatbots in nurturing healthier lifestyle choices. In addition, chatbots have been used in professional settings to help users reflect on experiences [93] or manage psychological transitions related to work [188], ultimately strengthening recovery and overall well-being. Educational initiatives have also seen the integration of pedagogically focused chatbots designed to improve learning outcomes [101]. For example, Zvereva et al. [205] proposed a dialogue-based approach to assess and improve student motivation.\nThe role of chatbots extends into the mental health domain, where they have been used to manage symptoms and improve quality of life [1]. In particular, Woebot [57], a chatbot based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), demonstrated effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial, highlighting the potential of chatbots to provide mental health support. In addition, chatbots have facilitated self-disclosure [110, 111] and promoted self-compassion [108], crucial components of personal well-being and behavioral change interventions.\nOur investigation is based on existing research surrounding the design and implementation of conversational agents for behavior change and well-being [31]. Using LLMs for chatbots presents promising prospects and novel challenges [82]. LLMs' ability to generate adaptive human-like responses offers an exciting frontier for behavior change technologies. However, LLMs also introduce ethical and safety concerns that surpass those associated with traditional chatbots, necessitating rigorous evaluations to understand their implications fully [45, 61, 197]. There are also questions regarding how users feel about social support delivered by an LLM. Through laboratory and field deployments, our work addresses these critical questions, exploring the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots in real-world settings. In addition, we explore the applicability and desirability of different forms of LLM-provided support, contributing to the literature on the types of automated social support to which users are the most receptive [22, 103, 128, 139]."}, {"title": "2.5 Situating Work in Broader CSCW & HCI Literature", "content": "As we saw in previous sections, the current literature emphasizes the pivotal role of human support in facilitating wellness practices, particularly in self-directed exercises (Section 2.1 and 2.2). Within the CSCW community, there is a growing emphasis on understanding the needs and preferences of people who pursue self-directed wellness and the development of supportive technologies [95, 105, 130, 133]. Human facilitators in various formats, from personal coaches available in popular mindfulness apps to instructors leading group sessions, have significantly improved engagement with interventions and outcomes [63, 109, 135]. These facilitators offer personalized guidance, emotional support, and accountability, aspects crucial to the success of such interventions [63]. Despite their effectiveness, human-led support faces limitations in cost, scalability, and accessibility"}, {"title": "3 FORMATIVE STUDY DESIGN", "content": "We conducted our formative study with 502 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk [92, 165] to understand user intentions regarding use of LLM agents for mindfulness.

The methodologies and rationale behind the study design are elaborated upon in the following sections."}, {"title": "3.1 Information Chatbot (Using LLM to Provide Information on Mindfulness)", "content": "Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a surge in the use of LLMs for information retrieval. LLMs have been increasingly integrated into web search platforms [175], such as by BingChat\u00b9 and PerplexityAI\u00b2. However, exploring LLM-based search engines' implications and capabilities in facilitating behavior change remains limited. In our study, we employed Information Chatbot as a design probe to provide mindfulness-related information to participants via dialogues. Drawing from existing literature on LLM prompts [40, 102], educational theories [38], and extensive preliminary testing, we crafted a specific system prompt for the GPT-3 model:\nThe following is a conversation with a Mindfulness instructor.

It introduced participants to mindfulness meditation and included exercises emphasizing the internal awareness of bodily sensations or breath in a curious and non-evaluative manner. We specifically selected mindful breathing for its foundational role in mindfulness practices.\nWhile the video specifically addressed mindfulness, its application extends as a representative model for various behavioral change interventions. Similar video-based approaches are instrumental in physical fitness, mental resilience training, dietary habits, and more, where visual and instructional components are essential for the participation and learning of participants [56, 124]."}, {"title": "3.3 Reflection Chatbot (Using LLM to Aid in Mindfulness-Related Self-Reflection)", "content": "In addition to providing informational support, LLMs can facilitate self-reflection and planning for post-learning activity practice. Research indicates that students' learning outcomes improve when they reflect on their metacognitive strategies and beliefs [151, 194]. Similarly, self-reflection has been recognized as an effective mechanism to encourage behavior change [69, 104, 150]. However, the role of LLMs in enhancing self-reflection to change behavior remains relatively unexplored. To investigate this, we used LLM2 (Reflection Chatbot) as a probe to assist participants in reflecting on their understanding of mindfulness and scheduling their daily mindfulness exercises. With GPT-3, we configured this chatbot with a system prompt analogous to that used with Information Chatbot:\nThe following is a conversation with a Mindfulness instructor. The instructor asks open-ended reflection questions to the Human to solidify the Human's understanding of Mindfulness and helps them plan when they can practice Mindfulness in their daily lives. The instructor has a sense of humour, is fair, and empathetic.\nAdditionally, we incorporated an initial greeting into the bot's prompt, \u201cHello. I am an Al agent designed to act as your Mindfulness instructor. I am here to help you reflect on your learnings. How can I help you?\u201d.

Participants reported their experience with mindfulness and were then introduced to the Core Mindfulness Message (Figure 1). The message described the concept of mindfulness and its benefits. This message served as a proxy for the type of mindfulness descriptions that one might typically find on social media platforms or news articles.\nSubsequently, the participants were randomly assigned to one of the 2 (Information Chatbot: Present vs. Absent) x 2 (Tutorial Video: Present vs. Absent) x 2 (Reflection Chatbot: Present vs. Absent) experimental conditions (depicted in Figure 1).

Technical issues arose when users did not respond to its questions, leading to the chatbot generating strange messages. Furthermore, the lack of memory capability to recall previous conversations was seen as a drawback. Additionally, a sense of tedium crept into interactions due to repeated content and similar chat experiences across multiple sessions, mainly when the initial prompts suggested by the chatbot were used.

This suggests that LLM agents can potentially elevate participants' initial motivation levels regardless of function. These agents can effectively influence user intentions, a critical step in the behavior change process [143]. Our work contributes to the long line of research in improving participants' intentions to practice wellness exercises [99, 117, 170].\nParticipants preferred different types of agent interaction depending on their immediate needs. For example, users found the information-providing chatbot more beneficial when they sought relaxation, focus, and comfort, highlighting the contextual flexibility of LLM agents. Although the accuracy of the information provided by LLMs has been a significant concern within the health community, our study suggests that focusing solely on accuracy may overlook the broader potential of LLMs. These agents can serve as a medium for users to \u201ctalk things out.\u201d The act of reflection and articulation itself can be therapeutic and supportive, reducing the pressure on LLMs to deliver perfectly accurate content [46, 54].

According to this theory, when people engage in inherently enjoyable activities that align with their interests and values, they experience increased intrinsic motivation. Mindy's informal and engaging dialogue mimics the positive dynamics of peer support, which has been extensively documented to increase engagement in health interventions [19, 49, 135]. Mindy's role could have expanded from being a mere informational tool to becoming akin to a peer-like companion, contributing to the participants' willingness to engage with the mindfulness exercises.\nFurthermore, the timing of Mindy's interaction, offered before participants begin the mindfulness exercise, and its constant availability may serve as an immediate reward when they launch the exercise. This immediacy is critical to fostering a habit loop, where the prompt of a Mindy interaction leads to the routine of starting the exercise, followed by the reward of a pleasant chatbot experience.

Consequently, this high baseline efficacy could mask additional advantages that come from integrating LLM agents. The impact of LLM agents might be more discernible in a setting where the baseline intervention is less robust [120, 152, 184]. A significant limitation of our findings about well-being is that they pertain only to actively engaged participants. Due to the voluntary nature of participation, we lacked self-reported measures from less engaged participants, resulting in a pronounced survivor bias in our results.\nFor the effect of Reflection LLM, the lack of significant disparities in outcomes across different groups may be attributable to the phenomenon of \u201cresponse shift bias\u201d [24, 76]. Specifically, participants who engaged with the Reflection LLM might have offered a more nuanced and precise evaluation of their stress levels and well-being after the intervention. This suggests that the act of reflection prompts a recalibration of internal benchmarks, leading to more accurate self-assessment, which can appear as a lack of change when, in fact, there is a deepened self-awareness. An additional consideration is the potential mismatch between the contemplative nature of the conversations prompted by the Reflection LLM and the fundamental principles of mindfulness,"}, {"title": "7.5 Implications for LLM-Augmented Interventions", "content": "Engagement is essential for the efficacy of AI-enhanced interventions in various domains, especially where user participation is crucial but typically low. For example, in educational technology, interaction with AI tutors has historically faced challenges maintaining learner engagement, as exemplified by IBM's struggles to develop an engaging AI tutor with Watson [183]. This issue goes beyond the accuracy of AI responses or the comprehensiveness of the information provided. For example, a recent analysis highlighted engagement with popular LLM applications like ChatGPT as 'lackluster,' with only about 14% of monthly active users engaging daily, a stark contrast to the 60-65% daily engagement rates seen with social media platforms [78]. This suggests that AI agents lack the \u201cstickiness\u201d or ongoing user appeal that other platforms manage to sustain.\nOur findings suggest that human-like qualities in LLM agents, such as the ability to engage in small talk, can significantly enhance user interaction and engagement, as demonstrated by increased involvement with video tutorials in our studies (for the group having access to Mindy). This insight has implications for other fields (e.g. mental health [100, 115], environmental campaigns [27], financial management apps [41], and training programs [81]), suggesting that AI \u201ccoaches\u201d designed to help with challenging tasks or learning could benefit from adopting more human-like behaviors. Apps such as Character.ai7, which boasts a stickiness score of 41% by allowing users to interact with historical or fictional figures, underscore the appeal of AI agents with human traits [78, 122]. Developers can align the LLM with human behavior to increase engagement, as has been done for other AI systems (e.g., chess engines [126]). However, while imbuing AI agents with human-like qualities may enhance engagement, it also raises potential risks and ethical concerns related to over-anthropomorphizing these agents [39, 125], which can lead to inappropriate reliance on these agents."}, {"title": "7.6 Ethical and Safety Considerations for Collaborating with LLMs for Behavior Change", "content": "Incorporating LLM-based agents into behavior change intervention introduces new ethical and safety considerations that add complexity to the landscape of digital interaction [121].

In this work, we used mindfulness as a case study to explore the potential of LLM agents to provide social support and collaborate in behavior change journeys. Our formative study indicated that agents that offered information or facilitated reflection increased participants' intentions to practice mindfulness. However, participants expressed a desire for deeper social interactions.\nIn the subsequent longitudinal deployment study, we found that integrating social companionship in an information LLM agent significantly improved engagement with mindfulness exercises. In contrast, the Reflection LLM agent did not demonstrate notable improvements. This discrepancy underscores the importance of validating LLM agents in long-term settings after initial single-session interactions, as preliminary perceptions may not fully capture their effectiveness. Enhancing the human-like qualities of these agents appears to increase their appeal and effectiveness.\nIntegrating LLMs into well-being technologies represents a promising direction for supporting successful behavior change interventions, offering more engaging and supportive interactions. Moreover, at a time when loneliness is increasing, and there is a growing unmet need for social support, LLM-based agents show promise. Our findings highlight their potential to address this gap effectively. However, relying on Al agents for social support is not without risks. Over-dependence could negatively affect human relationships, and the overuse of such agents raises important ethical and safety concerns.

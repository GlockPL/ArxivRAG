Accurate prediction of cleavage sites can facilitate various applications such as drug development, enzyme design, and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, most existing models are restricted to an individual enzyme, which neglects shared knowledge of enzymes and fails generalize to novel enzymes. Thus, we introduce a unified protein cleavage site predictor named UniZyme, which can generalize across diverse enzymes. To enhance the enzyme encoding for the protein cleavage site prediction, UniZyme employs a novel biochemically-informed model architecture along with active-site knowledge of proteolytic enzymes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniZyme achieves high accuracy in predicting cleavage sites across a range of proteolytic enzymes, including unseen enzymes. The code is available in https://anonymous.4open. science/r/UniZyme-4A67.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In the enzyme-catalyzed protein hydrolysis, protein will split at cleavage sites under the catalysis of proteolytic enzymes. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1. And it is crucial for a variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, immune response, and cell death, etc (Dixit, 2023). The positions of enzyme-catalyzed cleavage sites are determined by multiple factors. Accurate prediction of enzyme-catalyzed cleavage sites in the substrate proteins facilitates the identification of therapeutic targets and guides drug design (Turk, 2006). For instance, abnormal protein hydrolysis is closely associated with cancer, viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases, and predicting the cleavage sites of abnormal proteins under pathological conditions can reveal biomarkers or intervention targets. (McCauley & Rudd, 2016; Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, in the design of enzyme inhibitors or prodrugs, identifying key cleavage peptides, such as those cleaved under the catalysis of HIV enzyme, helps enhance drug specificity and minimize off-target effects (Devroe et al., 2005; Lv et al., 2015).\nCleavage sites of proteins with proteolytic enzymes can be identified through peptide specificity assays or high- throughput mass spectrometry, but these experimental methods are often challenging and expensive (Zheng et al., 2020). Therefore, developing efficient computational tools to complement experimental work is highly valuable. Recent studies have employed deep learning and traditional machine learning methods to advance the prediction of protein cleavage sites. For example, CAT3 (Ayyash et al., 2012) predicts caspase-3 cleavage sites based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM). ProsperousPlus (Li et al., 2023) integrates multiple methods to comprehensively evaluate cleavage site predictions.\nHowever, existing methods generally focus on an individual enzyme system. In contrast, many real-world scenarios require understanding how proteins are cleaved by different proteolytic enzymes. For instance, predicting off-target effects of protein therapeutics demands identifying potential cleavage sites for every relevant proteolytic enzyme in the human body's complex environment (Werle & Bernkop-Schn\u00fcrch, 2006). Although one could train separate predictors for each enzyme, this approach neglects crucial information shared among distinct enzyme-substrate interactions. In addition, the enzyme-specific model lacks the ability to deal with unseen enzymes, limiting its ability to predict cleavage sites for less-studied and de novo enzymes (Liu et al.). Therefore, it is crucial to develop a unified protein cleavage site predictor that can generalize across a diverse range of proteolytic enzymes.\nTo develop a unified protein cleavage site predictor for diverse proteolytic enzymes, the information of enzyme should be extracted and incorporated for the prediction. However, due to substantial cost of biological experiments, existing cleavage site databases only cover a small number of proteolytic enzymes (Tab. 1), which significantly challenge the learning of enzyme information encoder. Despite the limited coverage of enzymes in existing cleavage site datasets, many proteolytic enzymes are annotated with their active sites, which is the core functional region for catalyzing the protein hydrolysis. Specifically, the unique physicochemical environment of these active sites enables recognition of target substrates and lowers the activation energy required for cleaving specific peptide bonds. Therefore, we propose to leverage redundant knowledge of enzyme active sites to enhance the modeling of enzymes in enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage sites.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to achieve a unified cleavage site predictor enhanced with enzyme active-site knowledge. Two major challenges remain to be resolved. First, the cleavage process is influenced by various factors of enzymes such as 3D structures and environments of active sites. Check this. Hence, how to design the the architecture of enzyme encoder to effectively capture useful information for enzyme-catalyzed cleavage site prediction? Second, the active site regions of enzymes determine the specificity and efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. How can we leverage this rich information of active sites to improve cleavage site prediction? In an attempt to address the challenges, we propose a novel framework named UniZyme. More specifically, a biochemically-informed enzyme encoder is deployed along with the active site-aware pooling to produce high-quality enzyme representations. We further augment the enzyme encoder by pretraining on a supplemented enzyme set for active-site prediction. Furthermore, a joint training of enzyme active site prediction and substrate cleavage site prediction is applied in UniZyme. In summary, our main contributions are:\n\u2022 We investigate a novel and crucial problem of building a unified protein cleavage site predictor that generalizes across diverse proteolytic enzymes;\n\u2022 We propose a novel framework UniZyme that effectively integrates the enzyme active-site knowledge to enhance the cleavage site prediction in enzyme-protein interaction;\n\u2022 Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our UniZyme in predicting cleavage sites of substrate proteins for both seen and unseen proteolytic enzymes."}, {"title": "2. Problem Formulation", "content": "In this section, we firstly introduce the preliminaries of enzyme-catalyzed protein hydrolysis. Then, we present the formal problem definition of protein cleavage site prediction with enzyme active-site knowledge."}, {"title": "2.1. Preliminaries of Protein Hydrolysis", "content": "Cleavage Sites in Protein Hydrolysis. Protein hydrolysis is a biochemical process where proteins are broken down into smaller fragments such as amino acids and peptides under the catalysis of proteolytic enzymes. As illustrated in Fig. 1, during the protein hydrolysis, proteolytic enzymes will firstly recognize specific amino acid sequences or structural motifs within unfold substrate proteins. Then, the enzymes catalyze the cleavage of peptide bonds at the cleavage site, leading to the formation of smaller peptide fragments or individual amino acids. The positions of cleavage sites are governed by various factors including substrate's amino acid composition, spatial conformation, and unique properties of the enzyme (Klein et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2022; Turk et al., 2001). In therapeutic contexts, precisely designed enzymes can degrade disease-associated proteins while minimizing off-target effects (Tandon et al., 2021; Meghwanshi et al., 2020). Moreover, cleavage site prediction could pinpoint key molecular regions for therapeutic intervention in the development of targeted peptide-based drugs (Radchenko et al., 2019).\nCurrent Framework of Cleavage Site Prediction. Recent studies have employed machine learning models to predict cleavage sites (Wang et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2014; Verspurten et al., 2009; Li et al., 2019; 2020). However, these methods generally train an independent model for each enzyme, which only predict the cleavage sites of substrate proteins under the catalysis of one specific enzyme. Specifically, let Ps denote the substrate protein, this enzyme-specific cleavage site predictor aims to learn the $f : P_s \\rightarrow c_{e,s}$, where $c_{e,s} \\in {0,1}^{|P_s|}$ denotes the labels of cleavage site with the enzyme $P_e$. However, the training of enzyme-specific model excludes the valuable interaction knowledge from other enzyme-protein systems. In addition, the enzyme-specific model cannot generalize to unseen enzymes, which significantly limits its application in de novo enzyme design. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a unified cleavage site predictor capable of identifying cleavage sites in substrate proteins across various enzymes."}, {"title": "2.2. Preliminaries of Active Sites in Enzyme", "content": "During enzyme-catalyzed protein hydrolysis, the active site provides a specialized environment that lowers the activation energy required for peptide bond cleavage. The illustration of active site of the protein can be found in Fig. 1. With the active sites, enzymes can selectively recognize and bind target substrates, which further enables the cleavage of specific peptide bonds within substrate proteins (Selvaraj et al., 2022). Therefore, the active sites plays a crucial role in substrate cleavage. Hence, incorporating active site information can benefit the modeling of the enzyme-catalyzed protein hydrolysis, thereby enhancing the cleavage site prediction.\nResources for Active Sites. Thanks to the lower cost in annotating active sites of enzymes, UniProt (Consortium, 2024) provides 10,749 high-quality proteolytic enzymes with labeled active sites across multiple organisms. Because most of the entries are synthetic substrates instead of natural proteins, these data cannot be directly utilized for cleavage site prediction. However the rich information of active sites would be helpful in modeling the enzyme to facilitate the cleavage site prediction in protein hydrolysis."}, {"title": "2.3. Problem Definition", "content": "In protein hydrolysis, both enzyme $P_e$ and substrate $P_s$ are proteins composed of amino acid residues that fold into 3D structures. We denote a protein of length N by $P = (X, R)$, where $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ is the feature matrix of N residues, $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times 3}$ denotes the 3D positions of residues. We denote $c_{e,s} \\in {0,1}^{|P_s|}$ as the cleavage site label for the substrate protein $P_s$ under the catalysis of enzyme $P_e$. The training data for cleavage site prediction can be represented as $D_c = {(P_e^i, P_s^i, c_{e,s}^i)}_{i=1}^N$. In this work, we propose to enhance the cleavage site prediction with the active site information of enzymes. Hence, we will also utilize a set of enzymes labeled with active sites $a \\in {0,1}^{|P_e|}$, which is denoted as $D_a = {(P_e^i, a^i)}_{i=1}^N$.\nDuring the test phase, we will predict the cleavage site for each pair of test enzymes and substrates $(P_e^t, P_s^t)$. The active sites of test enzymes will not be available for inference. And the test enzyme $P_e^t$ can be either seen,i.e, $P_e^t\\in D_e$ or unseen, i.e, $P_e^t \\notin D_e$, which correspond to the applications on well-studied enzymes and de novo enzymes, respectively. For each test substrate protein $P_s^t$, its cleavage site with the test enzyme $P_e^t$ is not included in the training set $D_e$.With the above notations and descriptions, the formal definition of building a unified cleavage site predictor can be given by:\nProblem 1. Given the dataset $D_c$ annotated for cleavage site prediction and the supplemented dataset $D_a$ containing enzymes active sites, we aim to obtain a unified cleavage site predictor:\n$f : (P_e^i, P_s^i) \\rightarrow c_{e,s}^i$,\nwhich can accurately predict the cleavage site of test substrate proteins $P_s^t$ under the catalysis of test proteolytic enzymes $P_e^t$. Note that the test enzymes can be either seen or unseen during the training phase."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "In this section, we give the details of the proposed UniZyme. As the Fig. 2 shows, apart from the substrate encoder, UniZyme deploys an enzyme encoder to enable the generalization of cleavage site prediction across various enzymes. In addition, active site information in protein hydrolysis is incorporated into enzyme encoder training to enhance cleavage site prediction. Two main challenges remain to be addressed: (i) how to design the enzyme encoder to preserve critical information for cleavage site prediction? (ii) how to leverage the rich information of enzyme active sites to improve cleavage site prediction?\nTo tackle the above challenges, our UniZyme deploys a biochemically-informed enzyme encoder which augments the graph transformer with enzyme energy frustration(Dai et al., 2024). Furthermore, UniZyme employs active site-aware pooling to preserve the enzyme's information crucial for protein hydrolysis. To facilitate enzyme representation learning, UniZyme first pretrains the enzyme encoder using active site prediction with the supplemented enzyme set. Then, a joint loss of active site prediction and cleavage site prediction is employed to optimize the UniZyme for accurate cleavage site prediction. Next, we introduce each component in detail."}, {"title": "3.1. Biochemically-Informed Enzyme Encoder", "content": "Enzymes' 3D structures, especially the local environments around their active sites, are crucial for catalyzing protein hydrolysis. Although direct active-site annotations are often unavailable for test data, recent studies indicate that local energetic frustration can identify functionally important regions (Freiberger et al., 2019). Building on these insights, we propose a biochemically-informed enzyme encoder that integrates both the spatial positions of residues and their energetic frustration scores(Dai & Wang, 2021).\nInput Features and Backbone. Recent success of Al- phaFold and ESMFold demonstrates that protein language models can produce powerful representations from protein sequences for various protein tasks (Lin et al., 2023). Therefore, we initialize the input features of enzymes denoted as X with their ESM-2 representations. Then, we deploy an extended version of graph transformer (Ying et al., 2021; Jumper et al., 2021) to encode the input features with supplemented biochemical information for cleavage site prediction. Next, we introduce how we extend graph transformer to integrate the energetic frustration and 3D position information.\nEncoding Energetic Frustration. Previous studies indicate that local energetic frustration, referring to regions in a protein not optimized for minimal energy, is commonly observed around enzyme active sites and can significantly influence catalysis (Freiberger et al., 2019). To quantify this phenomenon, a frustration score F(i, j) is computed for each residue pair (i, j) within an enzyme $P_e$ following (Freiberger et al., 2019):\n$F(i, j) = \\frac{E(i, j) \u2013 \u00b5_{rand(i, j)}}{\u03c3_{rand (i, j)}}$,\nwhere E(i, j) is the actual interaction energy between residues (i, j) in the enzyme $P_e$. $\u00b5_{rand(i, j)}$ and $\u03c3_{rand (i, j)}$ represent the mean and standard deviation of interaction energies that derived from randomized configurations (see Appendix C for details). A higher F(i, j) implies stronger local energetic frustration, suggesting that the residue pair is more likely to belong to a functionally important region. Therefore, we incorporate this frustration score to provide useful biochemical information to the enzyme encoder.\nIntegrating Energy and 3D Position in Transformer. Following prior works (Luo et al., 2023), we encode the 3D positions by computing pair-wise distance between residues:\nD(i, j) = ||r_i - r_j ||_2,\nwhere $r_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the $C\u03b1$-atom coordinate of residue i. Both energetic frustration score and distance matrix capture pairwise relationships akin to the spatial encoding in graph transformers. Therefore, following Transformer-M (Luo et al., 2023), we locate those pair-wise signals to provide complementary information for the self-attention score computation. Concretely, for a enzyme $P_e = (X, R)$, we process both F(i, j) and distance matrix D(i, j) with a Gaussian Basis Kernel function followed by a MLP:\n$\\Phi_{i,j}^{energy} = MLP(\\Phi_{energy} (F(i, j)))$\n$\\Phi_{i,j}^{dist} = MLP(\\Phi_{dist} (D(i, j)))$,\nwhere $\u03a6_{energy}$ and $\u03a6_{dist}$ denote the learnable Gaussian Basis Kernel function that can map energy frustration score and distance score to a d-dimensional vector (See Appendix C for more details). MLP is further deployed to transform these vectors to the space of attention scores.\nWe then add the resulting $\u03a6_{i,j}^{dist}$ and $\u03a6_{i,j}^{energy}$ as bias terms to the self-attention mechanism. Denote $A_{i,j}^k$ as the (i, j)-element of the Query-Key product matrix in k-th attention layer, we have:\n$A_{i,j}^k = \\frac{(H^{k-1}W_Q)(H^{k-1}W_K)^T}{d} + \\Phi_{i,j}^{energy} + \\Phi_{i,j}^{dist}$\n$H^k = softmax(A^k)H^{k-1}W_V$,\nwhere $H^k \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ denotes the updated representation matrix. And $W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$ are projection matrices for the query, key, and value transformations. Following Transformer-M (Luo et al., 2023), $\u03a6_{energy}$ and $\u03a6_{dist}$ are shared for all layers."}, {"title": "3.2. Enhancing Enzyme Representation Learning with Active Site Knowledge", "content": "To incorporate crucial active-site knowledge into enzyme representation learning, we use three strategies: (i) an auxiliary active-site prediction task to strengthen the enzyme encoder, (ii) large-scale pretraining for active-site prediction to capture general catalytic patterns, and (iii) an active-site- aware pooling mechanism that emphasizes catalysis-related residues. Next, we give more details.\nActive Site Prediction. Active sites play a key role in catalyzing the protein cleavage. Hence, active-site information can provide essential understandings of enzyme functions. As a result, we deploy the active site prediction as the auxiliary task to benefit the enzyme encoder training by:\n$\\hat{a}_i = sigmoid(h_i \\cdot w_a)$,\nwhere $\\hat{a}_i \\in [0, 1]$ denotes the probability of the i-th residue being the active site, $h_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the representation of i-th residues in the enzyme, and $w_a \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ denotes the learnable parameters for active site prediction.\nPretraining with the Supplemented Enzyme Set $D_a$. The number of enzymes annotated in cleavage site database is limited, which poses a significant challenge for the effective training of enzyme encoders(Dai et al., 2023). However, there exists abundant enzyme data annotated with active sites. Therefore, we select enzyme types highly homologous to the target proteolytic enzymes in biological function to expand the pretraining dataset. Formally, the objective function of pretraining the enzyme encoder on the supplemented enzyme set $D_a$ can be written as:\n$\\min_{\\theta_e, W_a} L_a(D_a) = \\frac{1}{|D_a|} \\sum_{(P_e,a) \\in D_a} IBCE(\\hat{a}, a)$,\nwhere $\u03b8_e$ denotes the parameters of enzyme encoder. $\\hat{a} = [\\hat{a}_1, ..., \\hat{a}_n]$ denotes the probability vector of active site on the enzyme $P_e$. IBCE denotes the element-wise binary cross entropy loss. By pretraining on a large corpus of enzyme sequences, we allow the model to capture broader structural and functional patterns common across enzymes.\nActive Site-Aware Pooling. To obtain enzyme representation from a sequence of residue representations, a pooling operation such as mean pooling is required. However, residues that are active sites are more critical for enzymatic activity. Hence, intuitively, these active sites should contribute more in the aggregated enzyme representation(Dai & Wang, 2022). Therefore, we design an active site-aware pooling mechanism, whose pooling weights are based on the predicted active site probabilities. Let $\\hat{a}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ be the predicted probability that i-th residue is an active site in an N-residue enzyme. The active site-aware pooling can be written as:\n$h_e = softmax([w_1, ..., w_n])H, w_i = f(\\hat{a}_i)$,\nwhere $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ is representations of residues given by the enzyme encoder. f(\u00b7) is a learnable function that will map each $\\hat{a}_i$ to the pooling weight $w_i$. With the active site- aware pooling, we would be able to encourages the model to focus on catalytically relevant segments of the enzyme."}, {"title": "3.3. Cleavage Site Prediction", "content": "Substrate Protein Encoding. Similar to the enzyme encoding, we use ESM-2 representations to initialize substrate features. Since there is no functional region in substrates, we omit the energetic frustration encoding for the substrate protein. Only input features $X^s$ and distance matrix $D^s$ of the substrate $P_s$ are integrated in the transformer:\n$H^s = Transformer(X^s, D^s)$,\nwhere $H^s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|P_s|\\times d}$ is the substrate representation. Further implementation details are provided in Appendix C.\nCleavage Site Prediction. During protein hydrolysis, enzymes generally recognize local residue sequences about 15-30 residues in length. To reflect this biological behavior, we predict whether a subsequence of length l in substrate $P_s$ will be cleaved by enzyme $P_e$. Formally, this process can be written by:\n$c_{t}^{e,s} = MLP(CONCAT(H_{t:t+l}^s, h_e))$,\nwhere $H_{t:t+l}^s$ is a contiguous slice taken directly from the substrate representation matrix $H^s$ and $h_e$ is the enzyme representation obtained by Eq.(8). The length of the subsequence is set as 31 (15 residues on each side.). The optimization function of cleavage site prediction can be written as:\n$\\frac{1}{|D_e|} \\sum_{(P_e, P_s,c_{e,s}) \\in D_e} IBCE (c_{e,s}, \\hat{c}_{e,s})$,\nwhere $\\hat{c}_{e,s} = [..., \\hat{c}_t^{e,s}, ... ]$ denotes the probability vector of cleavage site within the substrate $P_s$ given the enzyme $P_e$.

Experimental Setup", "content": "Dataset Collection. The cleavage site dataset $D_e$ is sourced from the MEROPS database, which provides annotations for roughly 10,000 substrate cleavage sites across 876 enzymes. To ensure manageable sequence lengths, we exclude any enzyme or substrate sequences exceeding 1,500 residues(Dai et al., 2021). We then perform a standard dataset expansion procedure commonly used in cleavage site prediction, yielding approximately 220,000 valid enzyme-substrate pairs. The supplemented dataset $D_a$ is constructed by combining enzyme active-site annotations from in MEROPS (Rawlings et al., 2012) and UniProt (Consortium, 2024). Specifically, MEROPS provides active-site information for the enzymes already included in $D_e$. We further expand the active site data by retrieving hydrolase enzymes from UniProt with the EC number of 3.4.*.*, resulting to around 10K enzymes with active sites in total. The dataset statistics and dataset collection details can be found in Appendix A.\nEvaluation. To demonstrate the generalization ability of UniZyme, we evaluate its performance on protein cleavage site prediction for both seen enzymes (supervised) and unseen enzymes (zero-shot).\n\u2022 Supervised Setting: In this scenario, target enzymes are paired with training substrates whose cleavage sites are available. Following (Li et al., 2023; 2019), we use enzyme family M10.003, C14.003, and C14.005 as supervised benchmarks, and we randomly split their enzyme-substrate pairs in an 8:2 ratio for training and test.\n\u2022 Zero-shot Setting: In this setting, the target enzymes have no labeled cleavage sites in the training data. To rigorously examine generalization, we construct three zero-shot benchmarks from the hydrolase families,i.e., A01.009 and M10.004. We select 20% of enzymes in each family with <80% sequence similarity to any training samples with Needleman-Wunsch global alignment (Needleman & Wunsch, 1970).\nBaseline Methods. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compare against two specialized models: CAT3 (Ayyash et al., 2012), which predicts caspase-3 cleavage sites based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM), and ScreenCap3 (Fu et al., 2014), which focuses on caspase-3 cleavage site prediction by filtering high-quality data to improve prediction accuracy. We also compare with several deep-learning methods for cleavage site prediction on a single enzyme. Procleave (Li et al., 2020) introduces substrate structural features to account for structural biases in cleavage sites. ProsperousPlus (Li et al., 2023) integrates multiple methods to comprehensively evaluate cleavage site predictions. Additionaly, we also compare two SOTA enzyme-substrate interaction models, i.e., ClipZyme (Mikhael et al., 2024) and ReactZyme (Hua et al., 2024), which are originally designed for predicting reactions catalyzed by enzymes. We extend them to the cleavage site prediction task for comparisons. For ClipZyme, we utilize their pretrained EGNN enzyme encoder to the cleavage site prediction framework to demonstrate the superiority using active-site information in enzyme encoding. For ReactZyme, it deploys a ESM-2+MLP architecture for enzyme encoding. We retrain it on our data since its trained weights are unavailable. See Appendix B for more details.\nImplementation Details. We utilized the esm2-t12-35M-UR50D model to generate 480-dimensional input features for both enzymes and substrates. These features are then fed into the transformer-based enzyme encoder and protein encoder. The hyperparameter \u5165 is selected based on the validation performance.

Protein representation learning aims to effectively capture and represent the structural and functional features of proteins for downstream tasks. Inspired by large language models, recent years have seen the emergence of sequence-based pre-trained models such as ESM (Brandes et al., 2022), and ProtTrans (Elnaggar et al., 2021). In terms of methods that utilize structural information, geometric graph neural networks (Jing et al., 2020; Satorras et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022) and transformers with structural constraints (Ying et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2023) have become the widely-used architectures. The pretraining on structural information also facilitate the performance on downstream tasks. Accurate prediction of enzyme-catalyzed reactions requires better modeling of enzymes. ClipZyme(Mikhael et al., 2024) uses EGNN (Satorras et al., 2021) to represent protein graphs and utilizes ESM-2 embeddings to initialize node representations. ReactZyme (Hua et al., 2024), similar to ClipZyme, additionally employs a structure-based protein language model (Su et al., 2023). Although these methods combine structural and contextual features to represent enzymes, they do not incorporate the enzyme's energy landscape and active-site knowledge, which are crucial for understanding the enzyme's function and properties.\nCleavage Site Prediction. The early prediction of enzyme-catalyzed cleavage sites relied on substrate sequence patterns, such as CAT3 (Ayyash et al., 2012) and Screen- Cap3 (Fu et al., 2014), etc. Recently, machine learning- based methods such as Procleave (Li et al., 2020) and ProsperousPlus (Li et al., 2023) begin incorporating substrate structural features to capture the preferences of cleavage sites.

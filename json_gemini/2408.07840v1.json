Previous approaches face the challenges of not utilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history, which limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by integrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented generation (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time data, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships.

To model large amounts of real-world event data that represent complex interactions between entities over time, the temporal knowledge graph (TKG) has been introduced (Ding et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). TKG is used to represent structural relationships among entities through timestamped quadruples (s, r, o, t), where s and o are entities, r is a binary relation between them, and t specifies the time when the event (s, r, o) occurs. For example, the quadruple (Angela Merkel, visit, China, 2014/07/04) indicates that Angela Merkel visited China on July 4, 2014. In this task, temporal knowledge graph forecasting (TKGF) aims to predict future events of the graph by inferring missing entities in a quadruple for a future time. This involves generating predictions for either the object entity (s, r, ?, t+k) or the subject entity (?, r, o, t + k) by utilizing historical data from previous snapshots, where k represents the number of time steps or intervals into the future beyond the current time t. Existing research studies have provided theoretical methodologies for time-sensitive applications such as recommendation systems (Wang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022), financial analysis (Li, 2023), and social crisis early warning systems (Gastinger et al., 2023).\nTraditional approaches (Jin et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Han et al., 2020;\nSun et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022) involve converting event data into TKGs and combining graph neural networks (GNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) capture evolving entity relationships through embeddings. However, these methods must perform model training on specific datasets, which is resource-intensive. With the proven understanding and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), recent studies have explored methods on LLMs (Tao et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023b). The method proposed by (Lee et al., 2023) offers a more adaptable method for TKGF with in-context learning (ICL) on LLMs, allowing LLMs to adapt to TKGF by using examples in the context, without fine-tuning.\nNevertheless, due to limitations in the length of history of LLM inputs, this approach may not fully capture long-term trends among events and cannot effectively leverage past insights, such as causal relationships between events. Imagine a TKG scenario that relates to everyday life. An example quadruple could be: \u2018(Sarah, Consult, Dr. Smith, 2022/04/10)', indicating that Sarah consulted Dr. Smith on April 10, 2022. In this case, the ICL method may use static key values like 'Sarah' and \u2018(Sarah,Consult)' to extract historical events. However, this method may not account for Sarah's tendency to begin consultations with phone calls months before meeting in person, This is evident in events such as \u2018Discuss by telephone' being a preceding cause, for example, \u2018(Sarah, Discuss by telephone,\nDr. Smith, 2022/01/08)'. This long-standing pattern of initiating consultations with a call is a crucial piece of historical context that short-term data analysis could miss. Without considering these longer-term causal interactions, the LLM-based method may not make accurate future predictions. Besides, in datasets like ICEWS (Boschee et al., 2015), the distribution of data containing entities and relations is dynamically changing. The emergence of new relations during test time poses challenges for traditional ICL methods, which rely on fixed keyword-key value matching and cannot adapt over time. This highlights the need for methods that can dynamically capture and apply updates in real-time, enhancing adaptability in event prediction.\nTo overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework. It enhances both accuracy and adaptability in event prediction by addressing inadequate long-term causal relationship capture and enabling real-time adaptability for self-improvement without fine-tuning. Figure 1 illustrates a comparison of the ONSEP and ICL approaches. By contrast, ONSEP mainly has two novel components: 1) Dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM): Utilizing LLMs' external knowledge, DCRM semantically detects cause-effect links and dynamically constructs causal rules. This enables ONSEP to quickly adapt to new data and causal relationships, facilitating real-time updates and leveraging past experiences without extensive retraining. 2) Dual History Augmented Generation (DHAG):\nDHAG employs the long short-term bi-branch retriever (LSBBR) and a hybrid model inference (HMI) strategy to merge short-term and long-term historical contexts. The latter benefits from causal rules derived during the DCRM phase, enabling a broader event to be captured within the limits of historical input length. Inspired by the multi-branch fusion inference technology described in (Shi et al., 2023a), the HMI strategy applies weighted fusion to balance the contributions from both dual historical contexts. These innovations address the limitations of context length constraints in LLMs and improve the retrieval of relevant historical events over extended periods.\nONSEP shows significant performance gains on various datasets using InternLM2-7B model, achieving Hit@1 improvements over ICL of 9.63%, 9.35%, and 16.28% at history length 100, and 8.14%, 8.64%, and 15.25% at 200, and achieved competitive performance of embedding-based models trained on specific datasets. To summarize, our main contributions include:\n\u2022 We introduce DCRM, an innovative real-time adaptive causal learning module for LLMs that automatically updates the rule base at the snapshot level during testing.\n\u2022 We develop the DHAG module, which uses LSBBR and HMI strategies, allowing LLMs to effectively use historical data from different time scales for causal analysis.\n\u2022 Our framework includes an adaptive RAG solution that improves historical event retrieval and achieves self-improvement.\n\u2022 We demonstrate ONSEP's effectiveness across various models and datasets, showcasing its ability to enhance black-box LLM inference without the need for fine-tuning or manual annotations, thereby providing a robust and adaptable solution for diverse event prediction tasks."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting", "content": "A temporal knowledge graph (TKG) is structured as a time-sequenced series of multi-relational directed graphs.

Here, V denotes the set of entities, R the set of relations, and Et comprises timestamped facts as quadruples (s, r, o, t), with s, o \u2208 V and r\u2208 R. TKGF aims to predict future states of the graph by inferring missing entities in a quadruple for a future time.

Specifically, in TKGF, ICL harnesses the adaptability of LLMs for forecasting by leveraging historical data. For a query of future event q = (sq, rq,?,tn), where sq is an entity and rq is a relation at timestamp tn, this method employs static keys, such as entity sq or the pair (sq, rq), to retrieve the historical event chain Hn(q), a set of quadruples, from previous snapshots TKGn\u22121 = G1:n-1. Then the method constructs a prompt @q based on Hn(q). The prediction yq is generated by leveraging the LLM's probability distribution Yq ~ PLLM(yq|0q), employing ICL to generate forecasts without further training.\nTo effectively handle multi-word entity and relation names, a numeric mapping Ment and Mrel assigns unique labels to entities and relations. For example, candidate entities like [South Africa, China, New England] are mapped to numerical values [0, 1, 2] to align the outputs from the LLM with these candidates. During in-context learning, LLMs perform a forward pass to produce logits s for next-token predictions. These logits are then transformed into a probability distribution D using the softmax function, representing the likelihood of each candidate being the target entity or relation."}, {"title": "2.3 Causal Rules in TKG", "content": "Causal rules\u00b9 in TKG capture cause-and-effect links between events, denoted as CR(re,rc): (X,re, Y,T2) \u2190 (X, rc, Y,T\u2081), where X and Y represent anonymized entities, and T\u2081 and T2 are timestamps, with T\u2081 < T2 ensuring the correct temporal sequence from cause to effect.\nExtending this, we define a causal rule base (CRB) as a set of tuples, each comprising a causal rule (CR) and its confidence score (conf). The CRB for effect re at timestamp tn is denoted as: CRB\"(re) = {((X,re, Y,T2) \u2190 (X, rc\u2081, Y, T\u2081), conf) | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m}, where rc; indicates the cause relation, re denotes the resulting relation influenced by rc, and conf is the confidence score for the i-th causal rule at timestamp tn, a real number within [0, 1].

Detailed explanations are provided in the following sections."}, {"title": "3.1 Dynamic Causal Rule Mining", "content": "The dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) phase is crucial for identifying causal relationships within temporal knowledge graph. This phase utilizes a semantic-driven rule learning algorithm to discover causal rules. It is followed by a dynamic update module that updates the causal rule base (CRB), which is closely followed by a mechanism for rule filtering and sorting by confidence."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Semantic-Driven Rule Learning", "content": "This module is designed for the reflective learning of causal rules, structured around three core steps: candidate causes filter, causality assessment, and causal rule construction. Initially, it retrieves historical context Hn for all queries from Gn and real-time feedback Oy, which is the verified outcome for a query obtained when the system receives new data, to filter potential reason events. In the causality assessment phase, these candidates are then evaluated using a LLM to determine the most plausible cause event re. Finally, the identified cause event, along with the query's effect event re forms the basis for constructing a causal rule CR(re, rc). The algorithm of semantic-driven rule learning is outlined in Appendix A.\nCandidate Event Filter In the candidate event filtering phase, we utilize historical context and real-time feedback related to the query to filter potential causal events. Given a query q = (Sq, Re, ?, tn) at time tn, we define the context Hn(Sq) as a historical sequence of events associated with subject Sq, expressed as Hn = {(Sq, r, o, t) \u2208 Gn}. We select candidates based on the criterion that the object o is the same as the target Oy, thereby forming a set of candidate reason events He, formalized as:\nHc(q) = {(S, rc, \u00f4, t) \u2208 Hn(Sq) | \u00f4 = Oy}.\nHere, re represents a potential causal relation, \u00f4 is the filtered object that matches the target Oy, and t is the timestamp associated with the event. This methodology aims to pinpoint potential causative relations corresponding to re within the event sequence that links the query's subject S to the target entity.\nFor each distinct causative event re within the candidates of reason events, we first extract the set of quadruples from He that contain re, which we denote as Trc:\nTrc = {(s, r, o, t) | r = rc, (s, r, o, t) \u2208 Hc(q)}.\nWe then compute the support number supp(rc) as the count of quadruples of this set: supp(rc) =\nTrc. Subsequently, we calculate the coverage rate cove(rc) for each event rc using:\ncove(rc) = \\frac{supp(rc)}{|H_c(q)|} \\qquad(1)\nThis coverage rate aids in assessing the confidence level of causal rules and supports the review and selection of causal event candidates by the LLM."}, {"title": "LLM-based Causal Event Selection", "content": "In this step, the causal evaluation utilizes the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of the LLM to assess the degree of causal association between a set of potentially causal events. This evaluation aims to select the causal rules that are most relevant to the current query and feedback goals. A pivotal aspect of our methodology involves the formulation of a structured prompt 01 designed to direct the LLM towards discerning the most pertinent causal link between a given result event (re) and potential causes within the candidate reason events set\nHe(q). The selection mechanism utilizes LLM to obtain the logits L for numerically mapped candidate reasons, as same as the way how to generate an output for each test query. These logits represent the preliminary evaluation of each candidate's likelihood to be the true causal event. To convert these logits into normalized probabilities, we apply the softmax function, yielding the probability Pre\u2081 for each candidate reason rc\u2081, mapped to label idi using Mrel, reprented as s = LLM(01(re, Hc(q))), where s are the logits produced by LLM, The probability of each candidate reason re\u2081 is then computed by:\np(r_{ci}) = \\frac{e^{s[id_i]}}{\\sum_{j\\in M_{rel}}e^{s[id_j]}} \\qquad(2)\nBased on these probabilities, the top-k candidates are selected.

For each prediction query q = (Sq, Re,?, tn+1), LSTBBR extracts two distinct historical contexts: Hs representing the short-term history event chain and Hi representing the long-term causal event chain. This dual approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the immediate events as well as the underlying long-term causal influences. The short-term history event chain (H5) focuses on capturing the most recent events that are temporally proximate to the prediction query, providing an immediate context that reflects the latest developments. To construct Hs, the system retrieves events from Hn(Sq), sorting them by timestamp and truncating to include only the L most recent events. This truncated list of events forms Hs, which is directly associated with the query's subject Sq, thereby providing a snapshot of the most immediate historical backdrop relevant to the query.\nOn the other hand, the long-term causal event chain (H) is designed to uncover the broader causal dynamics that have shaped the subject S over a more extended period. This is achieved by initially retrieving cause rules from CRB(re) using a RECALL mechanism, which employs a key value approach where the effect relation re is used as the key to efficiently extract associated causal rules.\nSubsequently, cause events are filtered to construct the long-term cause event chain Hi from Hn(Sq).

The essence of the hybrid model inference (HMI) strategy involves merging the query q with the short-term history event chain H, and the long-term causal event chain H\u2081. This allows the LLM to produce distinct probabilities for each context, which are then combined using a weighted ensemble approach.\nFor the short-term context, the logits s\u2081 are obtained by s1 = p(y|q\u2295 Hs), where \u2295 symbol-izes concatenation. The logits s\u2081 are then normalized using the softmax function to produce a probability distribution D\u2081 = softmax(s1).

These results underscore ONSEP's superior performance over ICL, particularly in Hit@1 accuracy, indicating a notable enhancement in precision.\nWhile ONSEP trails behind some trained embedding models in Hit@10 due to the LLM's reliance on ranking candidate entities from the input history rather than all entities, it achieves top performance in Hit@1 for the ICEWS14 and ICEWS05-15 datasets.

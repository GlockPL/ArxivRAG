However, gaps and inaccuracies in well log data, often due to equipment limitations, operational challenges, and harsh subsurface conditions, can introduce significant uncertainties in reservoir evaluation. Addressing these challenges requires effective methods for both synthetic data generation and precise imputation of missing data, ensuring data completeness and reliability. This study introduces a novel framework utilizing sequence-based generative adversarial networks (GANs) specifically designed for well log data generation and imputation. The framework integrates two distinct sequence-based GAN models: Time Series GAN (TSGAN) for generating synthetic well log data and Sequence GAN (SeqGAN) for imputing missing data. Both models were tested on a dataset from the North Sea, Netherlands region, focusing on different sections of 5, 10, and 50 data points. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior accuracy in filling data gaps compared to other deep learning models for spatial series analysis. The method yielded R2 values of 0.921, 0.899, and 0.594, with corresponding mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 8.320, 0.005, and 151.154, and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.012, 0.005, and 0.032, respectively.

The process, organized into six distinct phases as illustrated in Figure 2, begins with collecting original well logs from the North Sea Dutch area. The data undergoes feature engineering to extract or enhance key features for modeling. Data preprocessing is performed to clean and normalize the data, followed by segmentation to suit model inputs. Correlation analysis between different data attributes helps in fine-tuning feature selection and architectural decisions, ensuring the data is optimally prepared for modeling.\nThe TSGAN architecture includes an autoencoder that compresses data into a dense latent space capturing requisite characteristics. The GAN setup comprises a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator evaluates the authenticity of data samples while the generator creates synthetic samples indistinguishable from real ones. The model processes both static and temporal features, enhancing its capability to handle complex depth series data efficiently. During the training process, the autoencoder is refined to minimize reconstruction errors, improving latent space representations. Supervised and joint training sessions help align synthetic data closely with real data statistics and spatial dynamics, which is crucial for generating high-quality synthetic sequences.\nEmbedding functions transform the data into a suitable format for training, focusing on key feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. A final training loop through adversarial training fine-tunes both the generator and discrimi-nator, enhancing their overall performance. Synthetic time-series data are generated to mimic the statistical properties of the original dataset. This synthetic data is then rescaled and plotted to visually compare the outputs against the real data, ensuring quality and consistency. Finally, the data is visualized using principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

Traditional GANs face challenges in maintaining the sequential dependencies necessary for time-series data. Although originally developed for time series, we have adapted TSGAN for spatial sequences in this study. TSGAN addresses these challenges by integrating both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms within a generative adversarial architecture, thereby preserving the spatial correlations fundamental for realistic synthetic data generation [11, 19, 30, 47].\nIn this study, TSGAN is utilized for generating synthetic depth-series data. Figure 3 illustrates the fundamental components of a TSGAN architecture, where the generator (G) attempts to create data that mimics real sequences and the discriminator (D) evaluates the authenticity of this data. This interaction forms the core of GAN operations, setting a foundation for more complex adaptations.\nUsing TSGAN is motivated by its proven ability to handle complex data distributions effectively [43, 41]. TSGAN is particularly well-suited for managing temporal/spatial sequences characteristic of well log data, ensuring that the synthetic data maintains realistic time-series properties [47]. The architecture includes a two-stage process: the first stage involves generating the primary features of the data, while the second stage refines these features to improve the accuracy and realism of the synthetic data. This dual-stage approach helps in capturing intricate patterns and dependencies in the data, making TSGAN highly effective for this application.\nTSGAN is constructed from several key components:\n\u2022 Generator (G): The generator creates time-series data trying to mimic the real data distribution.\n\u2022 Discriminator (D): The discriminator distinguishes between the outputs of the generator and the actual data.\n\u2022 Embedding Network: This transforms high-dimensional time-series data into a lower-dimensional, manage-able latent space. This transformation aids in capturing the crucial features of data while reducing noise.\n\u2022 Recovery Network: This maps the latent representations back to the original data space, ensuring that the generated sequences can be translated back into interpretable time-series data."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Mathematical formulation of TSGAN", "content": "The training of TSGAN is structured around the optimization of both adversarial and supervised losses:"}, {"title": "2.2.4 Broader applications of TSGAN", "content": "TSGAN has been widely applied to generate synthetic data across various applications, showcasing its versatility and robustness in handling complex datasets.

Figure 4 outlines the sequential steps involved in data imputation using SeqGAN, BRITS, and NAOMI, demonstrating a structured approach to address the challenges of missing data in well logs. The process begins in Phase 1, where well logs are prepared by segmenting the original data into training and testing datasets, ensuring that both datasets adequately represent the complexities of real-world geological formations. This phase sets the foundation for effective model training by establishing a diverse data environment.\nIn Phase 2, each model undergoes rigorous training tailored to its unique capabilities. SeqGAN leverages adversarial training to refine the generation and discrimination of sequential data, enhancing its ability to replicate and restore spatial sequences. BRITS utilize bidirectional recurrent neural networks to exploit spatial dependencies effectively, ensuring the continuity and coherence of time-series data. Simultaneously, NAOMI applies a hierarchical approach to tackle imputation at multiple resolutions, accommodating the varied granularities inherent in geological data.\nPhase 3 transitions to testing and validation, where models are subjected to real-world conditions simulated by the application of mask matrices. This phase is imperative as it involves the application of the models to the testing dataset to fill in missing values and verify their imputation accuracy. The use of mask matrices helps simulate various scenarios of missing data, providing a robust test environment to evaluate each model's effectiveness.\nFinally, Phase 4 focuses on the refinement and evaluation of the models. It involves fine-tuning the models based on the feedback received from the testing phase.

SeqGAN adapts the adversarial training framework to effectively impute missing sequences, ensuring that the continuity and spatial dependencies, integral to geological sequences are maintained. Figure 5 (a) illustrates the SeqGAN framework, showing how it intelligently fills in missing sequence data. The generator in SeqGAN is trained to predict missing segments based on both preceding and subsequent available data, while the discriminator assesses the coherence and authenticity of the generated sequences against real data. This dynamic interaction ensures that the imputed data are not only plausible but also consistent with the spatial patterns of existing sequences.\nSeqGAN is particularly valuable for well log data analysis, where maintaining the integrity of depth-series data is crucial. The ability to accurately reconstruct missing parts of a sequence greatly enhances data reliability and usability for subsurface geological analysis. SeqGAN's approach provides a robust method for dealing with the often irregular and gap-ridden data obtained from field measurements, ensuring that subsequent analyses and decisions are based on comprehensive and accurate data sets [48]. Unlike traditional imputation methods that might treat data points independently or apply simple interpolation, SeqGAN utilizes the sequential context of data, which is crucial for depth-series like well logs.

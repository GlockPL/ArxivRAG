Lawyers encounter significant challenges in delivering prompt and accurate information to their clients across these various lawsuit types, particularly when it comes to crucial aspects like potential imprisonment duration or financial repercussions in case of unsuccessful lawsuits. This difficulty arises from the necessity to navigate extensive legal documentation and precedent to provide informed responses. Unfortunately, this process not only prolongs legal proceedings but also introduces inconsistencies and uncertainties in legal outcomes [82]. Using the U.S. as an example, compounding this issue is the fact that, according to the U.S. Financial Education Foundation (USFEF) [44], over 40 million lawsuits are filed annually in the United States. However, the total number of registered lawyers in the United States from 2007 to 2022 was only approximately 1.34 million. This highlights a severe scarcity of legal experts or practitioners. Consequently, there is an urgent need to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional legal proceedings and workflows.\nIn recent years, spurred by rapid advancements in deep learning, researchers have increasingly turned to the application of deep learning techniques within the realm of legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) [82]. This trend has led to the proposal of several new LegalAI datasets [7, 8, 15, 45, 73], which serve as pivotal benchmarks for research in this burgeoning field. Leveraging these datasets, researchers have embarked on exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based solutions for a range of LegalAI tasks, including legal judgment prediction [1, 9, 53, 81], legal entity recognition and classification [2, 5], court view generation [76], legal summarization [3, 18], and legal question answering [46, 56, 65].\nHowever, existing methodologies in LegalAI frequently encounter challenges when attempting to accurately compute specific numerical values for legal-related estimations, such as compensations or prison durations, based on available data. This difficulty probably stems from the predominant emphasis of current legal datasets on traditional NLP text-based tasks like summarization, judgment"}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we explore the significant developments across three pivotal areas in the integration of AI within the legal domain. Starting with the early applications of conventional AI to tackle legal challenges, we then transition to the critical role of LegalAI datasets in refining and enhancing AI's capabilities for legal applications. Finally, we delve into the advancements brought forth by LLMs, which have reshaped the landscape of NLP and AI, offering novel methodologies and approaches in the legal field."}, {"title": "2.1 Conventional AI in Legal Contexts", "content": "The intersection of AI with the legal domain has evolved significantly, transitioning from rule-based expert systems to sophisticated deep learning models. Early endeavors in LegalAI sought to replicate human legal reasoning through systems like TAXMAN and HYPO, which employed rule-based logic to navigate legal principles [16, 61]. While these systems laid the groundwork for Al's application in legal contexts, they were limited by the scope of their hardcoded knowledge and lacked the ability to generalize beyond their specific programming."}, {"title": "Deep Learning and Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP)", "content": "The exploration of LJP using deep learning technology marks a significant milestone in LegalAI. The authors of [21, 51, 68] have pioneered this domain by employing neural networks to analyze legal documents and predict outcomes. These advancements not only showcase the potential of novel models in enhancing performance but also underscore the importance of leveraging deep learning for more accurate legal analytics."}, {"title": "Innovations in Model Architectures", "content": "The drive to improve LJP performance has led to the adoption of more sophisticated neural network architectures. For instance, the authors [9] introduced gating mechanisms to refine the prediction of penalties, while the authors of [57] developed multi-scale attention models to address the complexities of cases with multiple defendants. These innovations highlight the continuous search for model architectures that can better capture the nuances of legal reasoning."}, {"title": "Utilization of Legal Knowledge", "content": "A notable direction in recent LegalAI research is the integration of legal knowledge into AI models. In [53], the use of attention mechanisms between facts and law articles exemplifies how AI can leverage legal knowledge to improve charge predictions. Similarly, the topological graph approach utilizes the relationships between different LJP tasks, demonstrating the value of structured legal knowledge in enhancing model performance [81]."}, {"title": "Advancements in Legal Entity Recognition and Other NLP Applications", "content": "Beyond LJP, significant progress has been made in legal entity recognition, classification, and other NLP-based tasks. [2, 5] in developing models for legal entity recognition and classification have paved the way for more sophisticated document analysis techniques. Additionally, innovations in court view generation and legal summarization by [18, 76] have opened new avenues for automating the synthesis and summarization of legal texts."}, {"title": "Legal Question Answering", "content": "The domain of legal question answering has also benefitted from AI advancements, with researchers developing models that provide precise responses to complex legal inquiries. The contributions by [46, 56, 65] in this space further bridge the gap between legal knowledge and AI capabilities, offering promising tools for legal practitioners and the public.\nThe shift from conventional AI to deep learning within the legal sector signals a paradigm transformation, enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of legal analyses and democratizing legal expertise. However, this advancement brings forth challenges such as the opaque nature of deep learning models [13, 20, 23-42, 50, 69, 72, 75, 77-80, 84], which often operate as \"black boxes\", making it difficult to discern the logic behind their decisions. This opacity poses a significant issue in the legal domain where the rationale for decisions is paramount. Additionally, deep learning models are prone to reflecting the biases present in their training data, raising ethical concerns about fairness and impartiality in AI-generated legal outcomes. Moreover, these models sometimes struggle with generalizing to new, unseen scenarios, limiting their applicability to the diverse and unique nature of legal cases.\nOur approach aims to mitigate these drawbacks by harnessing the power of LLMs augmented with in-context learning and specifically designed prompts to improve interpretability, reduce bias, and enhance generalization capabilities. We focus on making the reasoning processes of LLMs more transparent, enabling legal professionals to understand and trust AI-generated insights. By implementing comprehensive bias audits and adjustments, our methodology strives to ensure ethical standards and fairness in legal AI applications. Additionally, we incorporate in-context learning to endow models with adaptability to diverse legal scenarios, bridging the divide between traditional legal practices and modern AI capabilities. This synergistic integration of human expertise and AI promises to revolutionize legal practices, making them more efficient, equitable, and adaptable to the evolving demands of the legal domain."}, {"title": "2.2 LegalAI Datasets", "content": "The evolution and impact of LegalAI have been markedly accelerated by the advent and meticulous development of various legal datasets. These datasets, each meticulously curated to reflect the intricacies of legal processes and knowledge, have been instrumental in propelling forward the application of AI in the realm of law. They serve as a critical bridge, connecting traditional legal expertise with the computational efficiency and scalability of modern AI technologies.\nAmong these, the JEC-QA dataset introduced by [83] emphasizes the growing necessity for specialized datasets geared towards facilitating question-answering mechanisms within legal contexts. This need is echoed in contributions such as CAIL2019-SCM by [15, 74], which focus on aspects like case similarity and judicial reading comprehension, thereby underscoring the imperative to thoroughly understand and interpret judicial documents. The contributions of [6, 7] further expand LegalAI's research scope, introducing datasets for multi-label text classification on EU legislation and for neural legal judgment prediction in English. These efforts significantly enhance the textual analysis capabilities of AI models while broadening their application across different legal systems. In parallel, the work [55] on summarizing contracts into plain English addresses the critical need for making legal documents more comprehensible and accessible, reinforcing Al's role in demystifying legal language. The dataset CAIL2018 by [73] further exemplifies the Al's potential in automating and predicting legal outcomes, offering a robust platform for judgment prediction. Furthermore, the LENER-BR dataset by [54], aimed at named entity recognition in Brazilian legal texts, highlights the importance of specialized Al models for legal document analysis and information extraction. Similarly, the COLIEE dataset by [45] and the legal case law search test collection by [52] provide vital resources for evaluating legal information extraction, entailment, and the performance of legal search engines, underscoring the comprehensive nature of LegalAI studies. Moreover, the inclusion of datasets like JURISDIC by [11] for legal dictation in Polish, the LKIF Core ontology by [19] for basic legal concepts, and the HOLJ corpus by [17] for legal text summarization, each adds a unique dimension to the LegalAI research landscape. These contributions not only aid in the development of AI models tailored for legal text processing but also highlight the interdisciplinary synergy among linguistic, legal, and computational domains. The integration of deep learning methodologies, particularly for achieving semantic-level similarity calculations as seen in the work of [66], represents a significant stride towards refining legal information retrieval (LegalIR). The pursuit of improved embedding techniques and document-level analyses further exemplifies the ongoing efforts to enhance the precision and efficiency of legal document processing [48, 64].\nThis comprehensive overview underscores the significant shift towards incorporating sophisticated AI tools in legal research, emphasizing the indispensable role of meticulously designed datasets in fostering innovation and enhancing the understanding of legal reasoning and decision-making through AI. The careful development and curation of these datasets have greatly contributed to advancements in LegalIR and AI-driven legal applications. However, existing datasets are predominantly geared towards NLP text-based tasks and lack suitability for evaluating the numerical estimation proficiency of LLM models within the legal domain. Recognizing this limitation, there is a clear need for the introduction of a real-world dataset meticulously designed to gauge LLM's efficacy in numerical estimation tasks pertinent to legal contexts, including but not limited to house value and imprisonment duration estimation. This need underscores the motivation behind our proposal for such a dataset."}, {"title": "2.3 Large Language Models", "content": "The integration of LLMs into the realm of NLP and AI marks a significant milestone in the advancement of technology. Models like GPT [4] and BERT [12] have been at the forefront of this evolution, showcasing an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human language across a variety of tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering [4, 12]. The significance of these developments extends beyond the enhancement of Al's linguistic capabilities, as they lay the groundwork for broader applications in multiple domains.\nThe scaling of LLMs, as highlighted by the works of [59, 67], has propelled NLP to new heights, enabling machines to perform tasks with a level of sophistication that was previously unattainable. A key breakthrough in this journey has been the discovery of LLMs' inherent ability for zero-shot and few-shot learning, which has revolutionized the way these models are applied to solve tasks with minimal initial guidance [49]. This led to the emergence of \"prompting\" techniques, fundamentally altering how models are conditioned to perform specific tasks, thereby enhancing their utility across a range of applications [60, 62]. Despite their successes, traditional prompting methods faced limitations in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks, leading to the development of the \"chain-of-thought (CoT)\" prompting technique. This technique, inspired by human problem-solving strategies, has significantly improved LLMs' performance in tasks requiring intricate reasoning, demonstrating the versatility and adaptability of these models in tackling more sophisticated challenges [70, 71]. Expanding the application of LLMs into mathematical reasoning, techniques like Zero-shot-CoT and MathPrompter have showcased the potential of LLMs in solving arithmetic problems and conducting mathematical analysis by generating algebraic expressions or Python functions. This not only underscores LLMs' ability in arithmetic tasks but also highlights their reliability through the validation of intermediate steps, as evidenced by their performance on the MultiArith dataset [43, 47].\nThe progress in LLM technologies marks a significant shift towards more versatile and intelligent AI applications, expanding their influence from linguistic to non-linguistic domains, particularly in the legal sector. Our initiative, aimed at improving decision-making and operational efficiency within the legal domain through LLMs, harnesses these advancements to tackle the distinct challenges encountered by legal professionals. By integrating LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities with tailored prompts, our goal is to enhance the precision and efficacy of legal workflows, thereby bridging the traditional methods of legal practice with contemporary technological innovations. The introduction of a curated dataset tailored for precision-focused LegalAI tasks further substantiates our approach, affirming the potential of LLMs to revolutionize legal processes and contribute to a more streamlined, accessible, and equitable legal system."}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "The proposed method encompasses several essential components, including in-context learning and specially designed prompts.

This entails providing the model with a task description in natural language along with a small number of examples. The effectiveness of this learning capability hinges on scaling model size, data, and computing resources. [10, 14, 58, 63] have proposed various training methodologies for different types of LLMs. These models exhibit a notable capacity to leverage few-shot prompts for accomplishing unseen tasks without the necessity of fine-tuning, a capability that emerges prominently in LLMs compared to their smaller counterparts. While LLMs [4, 10] have showcased remarkable success across various NLP tasks, their aptitude for reasoning has often been viewed as limited. It's important to note that merely scaling up the model size does not necessarily enhance this capability.\nRecent advancements have introduced the concept of \"chain of thoughts\" prompting, also known as in-context learning, as a potent technique to augment the reasoning prowess of LLMs when processing text [71]. This method entails presenting the model with multiple instances of reasoning chains, enabling LLMs to learn and apply the underlying template to solve intricate, unseen tasks effectively. Notably, the \"chain of thoughts\" approach bears resemblance to the strategy employed in the Visual Question Answering task, where addressing basic questions aids in tackling complex queries [22]. These recent findings underscore the robust reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Nevertheless, the current research landscape in LegalAI predominantly concentrates on text-based tasks such as legal question answering and legal summarization. In contrast, this paper aims to investigate the capacity of LLMs, coupled with in-context learning, to tackle precision-oriented tasks through meticulously designed prompts.

Each example is accompanied by corresponding answers such as house prices, compensation values, or durations of imprisonment. These examples serve as training demonstrations for LLMs to predict outputs for unseen test examples.\nConsider the prompt format illustrated in Figure 2 as a case in point. The first step in designing prompts entails extracting pivotal information from each judgment, ensuring a uniform textual description format encompassing information on injuries and compensation amounts. Following this, the next step involves framing a question that pertains to forecasting trends based on the provided cases. The proposed prompt format is devised to aid the LLM in identifying patterns within the presented cases. By leveraging these discerned patterns, the LLM is empowered to make predictions for the given test cases.

Predicting compensation amounts in finger injury cases, 2. Forecasting housing market prices, and 3. Evaluating sentencing in fraud cases.\nThe first application involves predicting compensation amounts in civil cases, particularly in scenarios like car accidents or property damage disputes. Determining compensation often hinges on various factors, such as the type of vehicle involved in accidents or the severity of bodily injuries sustained. Despite having detailed case information, lawyers may still struggle to accurately estimate compensation, leading to challenges in decision-making regarding settlement or litigation. By leveraging LLMs and extensive historical judgment data, this approach provides a more objective insight into compensation trends. This aids lawyers in promptly assessing potential judgment outcomes and refining legal strategies. While this paper primarily examines the correlation between finger injuries and compensation amounts, this methodology can be extended to other civil case types or factors influencing judgment amounts.\nThe second application focuses on assessing housing market values, which proves valuable not only in cases concerning damaged real estate but also in scenarios involving property division or compensation for property encroachment. In these situations, property market values play a crucial role in determining case outcomes. Furthermore, the versatility of the proposed method extends to determining land market values, highlighting its broad applicability in legal practice.\nThe third application focuses on predicting the severity of criminal sentences in criminal cases, which is typically influenced by factors such as the nature and magnitude of the crime, as well as the defendant's post-crime conduct. Despite the availability of detailed case specifics, lawyers often face challenges in accurately predicting sentence severity. Leveraging LLMs to analyze past judgment data and discern the relationship between specific factors and sentence severity enables a more objective prediction of sentencing outcomes, thereby enhancing the quality of legal advice provided. While this study concentrates on predicting sentence severity based on fraud amounts, this research direction is poised to expand to encompass other factors or criminal areas.\nHowever, trends in judgments may not remain static, and unique factors in individual cases could deviate from past judgment outcomes. These nuances still necessitate resolution by experienced lawyers. Therefore, the current applications do not aim to replace lawyers but rather serve as valuable tools for optimizing research and decision-making processes, reducing time consumption, and alleviating the financial burden of legal fees on litigants."}, {"title": "6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "The legal field faces substantial challenges in delivering timely and accurate information across a spectrum of lawsuit types, exacerbated by the intricacies of legal documentation and the limited availability of legal experts.

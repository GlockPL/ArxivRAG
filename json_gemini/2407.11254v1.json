{"title": "Conquering images and the basis of transformative action", "authors": ["Hunter Priniski"], "abstract": "Our rapid immersion into online life has made us all ill. Through the generation, personalization, and dissemination of enchanting imagery, artificial technologies commodify the minds and hearts of the masses with nauseating precision and scale. Online networks, artificial intelligence (AI), social media, and digital news feeds fine-tune our beliefs and pursuits by establishing narratives that subdivide and polarize our communities and identities. Meanwhile those commanding these technologies conquer the final frontiers of our interior lives, social relations, earth, and cosmos. In the Attention Economy, our agency is restricted and our vitality is depleted for their narcissistic pursuits and pleasures. Generative AI empowers the forces that homogenize and eradicate life, not through some stupid \"singularity\" event, but through devaluing human creativity, labor, and social life. Using a fractured lens, we will examine how narratives and networks influence us on mental, social, and algorithmic levels. We will discuss how atomizing imagery-ideals and pursuits that alienate, rather than invigorate the individual hijack people's agency to sustain the forces that destroy them. We will discover how empires build digital networks that optimize society and embolden narcissists to enforce social binaries that perpetuate the ceaseless expansion of consumption, exploitation, and hierarchy. Structural hierarchy in the world is reified through hierarchy in our beliefs and thinking. Only by seeing images as images and appreciating the similarity shared by opposing narratives can we facilitate transformative action and break away from the militaristic systems plaguing our lives.", "sections": [{"title": "Networks of images of Vitality", "content": "Malevolent networks indoctrinate society with images of Vitality: pictures of self-actualization, success, and interior security; an evolving, evading dream of securing heaven in the earthly world. In reality, Vitality is limitless and imageless. Vitality is Supreme. Vitality exists in the feelings inside your nose, eyes, ears, skin, and muscles. Vitality is shared between all bodies and things. When one feels vital, their body and mind is actualized in the here and now. They are in a child-like state of \u201cflow\u201d [Csikszentmihalyi, 1975], where the self momentarily ceases and creation is inherently transformative.\nVitality is the source of our attention and agency and exists below our self-image. One's attention is our collective connection, and is \u201cthe elementary human unity... the form of life\" [Tiqqun, 2010].\nExperiencing attention is effortless but embodying its energy requires constant effort. You can not actualize when focusing on images of actualizing, just as you can't act when you reflect on how to act; and you can't love another when focusing on how they ought to show their love to you. We feel vital when we attend without an objective and act without the purpose of securing life. We love when we do not expect love in return. Love and attention, being Vitality, are beyond the grasp of images and the cycles of desire and expectation.\nA broken definition of images. Images are our pictures of the world, ourselves, and others. Images capture Vitality by representing it at a given moment of time. An image results from a complex chain of psychological processes that construct a picture of where attention is directed in the world. For example, when we see an apple on a table, we construct an image of it in our mind. This image is incomplete as we can only see one side of the apple, cannot view its interior space, or comprehend is energy potential, among much else. A multitude of facts exist about the apple that we cannot comprehend in unity, as we can only direct our mind towards a subsection of these facts at a given time. This is one reason why images are incomplete. The other reason images are incomplete is because the world is in constant flux. Change is the one true fact of the exterior world. Images are incomplete because by the very next instant,"}, {"title": "The separating force of images and nar-ratives", "content": "Atomizing imagery sustains self- and societal development by exploiting the separation between attention and desire. Images define the boundaries of our identities and social groups, our historical narratives, and shape the physical environment. They correspondingly enable us to variably ward off and embrace beliefs about what we think we are, with whom we belong, what happened in our past, and what is out there to conquer in the future.\nImages reinforce a separation within our interiors and seeking them sustains a loss of equilibrium that necessitates the use of force to resolve. In the pursuit of security, we strive to balance ourselves, groups, and states by warding-off current images only to embrace the next one: a more niche aesthetic, a more radical political ideology, a more powerful weapon (whether it's a word or a gun), a higher paying job, gallery representation, a Nature publication, an influencer girlfriend. Images motivate us to take control of the world and others to possess the stillness of a secure interior. However, each image we desire does not settle us and only perpetuates our separation.\nWhen we identify with an image and want to obtain it as our own (i.e., to recognize ourselves in that image), we are insecure and desire to secure ourselves through embodying the sought after image. Obtaining an image requires calculated effort, and securing it can only happen in the future or past. Because there is a distance between now and the desired future or longed-for past, a time-interval separates oneself from all images. Thought works to collapse the interval between the present and desired image by optimizing actions (life) through efficient use of images and language (communication of images). Images constitute our memory and influence our beliefs as our memory and beliefs influence the images we pursue. Seeking images that optimize our lives are therefore bound to optimize our societies. Images carve the world into categories that enter into cause-effect relationships. Categories discretize a continuous world. Saying something belongs to a certain category requires saying other things do not belong to that category (barring practically trivial categories like 'the set of all things'). Cause-effect relationships represent how categories should behave and what you can expect from their behavior.\nThey also hold between categories, which define their boundaries of application. Cause-effect relationships describe how instances of some category bring about instances of another category by describing how categories change in time. Categories and causal relations are two sides of the same coin; they are the media of our memory.\nGrouping things according to what they are and what they are not is a consequence of using categories and cause-effect relationships to carve up the world. After all, a category would be of no use if it failed to make any discrimination between members and non-members. This discriminative capacity of categories and, by extension, the cause-effect relationships they participate in is what gives images their separating force. If we have an image of ourselves in the present moment that diverges from the image we desire, we orient our attention to align our actions to embody the sought after image. Desiring to embody an image is synonymous"}, {"title": "Commodifying oneself for another's con-sumption", "content": "Atomizing imagery structures people's interior lives around commodification, accounting, and control. Seeking progressive images requires optimizing one's connection to other people and the world. Optimization and development enables more efficient forms of conquest, and allows people and societies to secure interiors and dominate exteriors with increased precision.\nIn conquest for a higher position (self-security at the level of the individual and social-security at the level of society), atomizing imagery drives people to manipulate and define their lives for consumption. Whether it's a rising-star scientist at a top research institution, or the girl from your hometown declaring her unwavering love for her nth boyfriend on Instagram, those who believe in and produce atomizing imagery full-heartedly experience their life through their self-image and therefore support the maintenance of hierarchy, state, and empires. Their world becomes a marketplace where the totality of their relationships with others is reduced to a zero-sum game, and another's attention must be secured to increase one's own. Life becomes a selfish pursuit of a highly curated identity through which people attempt to distinguish themselves against the monotonous cacophony of postmodern life.\nLiving in relation to images pulls the self out of its sensing body and into states of reflection, optimization, and prediction. Images promise us that we'll become something great if we work a bit harder, a bit longer. But experiencing life in relation to images and material manipulation is a constant mirage over the horizon. You'll #Rise-AndGrind endlessly towards the image you sought for yourself and shared for others to consume, and you'll grow very thirsty forgetting how to breathe.\nRepresenting your life for another's consumption makes you move outside the instant and positions you in a space with endless distance spawned by the separating force of categories and cause-effect relationships. Confusing the map for the territory, people lose touch with their own life and are perpetually imbalanced. As confusion grows, the neural pathways of dissociation are strengthened, and the body learns to believe more strongly that it can only become vital through securing another atomizing image or by conquering another's life.\nEscaping time, one may realize the image they are currently latched onto dissolves once obtained. Deflated, most re-enter time to inflate themself by moving on to a new image. But the next image, like the previous, only distracts us from the driver of all possessive thinking and action: Fear of death and non-existence, the forever-loss of one's images. Images cannot conquer death because they are of time, and pursuing their parasitic trace separates one's mind from Vitality; thus perusing them sustains our fear of death, never resolves it. Images cannot save us from our memories because they are composed of our memories.\nWhen we search for life, we act to define ourselves. We hope to encode our image in another's mind and secure their attention to increase our own vitality. Acting to define ourselves for others' con-"}, {"title": "Break free from atomizing imagery", "content": "How can we step out of the frame set by atom-izing imagery? We search for a method or cure, because our insatiable pursuit of images presupposes that the emancipation and actualization we seek lies outside of us. Any solution based on images is atomizing and therefore alienating; the only path towards transformation is to rediscover our ability to attend to the world and others and to ultimately embody our collective, rather than individualistic, agency. When you completely attend to something a flower, a person, a pain is there a time interval between you and the object of your attention? What happens when you categorize an object as a type of flower, person, or pain? Your memory of those categories conditions your experience of those things right now. Memory pulls bodies into time and away from attention to categorize the world. We see a flower and grasp its vibrance only in relation to the vibrance of other flowers stored in our memory. We consider each person in light of our earlier decisions about others. We experience pain's sting in the context of our pleasant sensations yesterday. All of these representations are of the past and outside of attention, and comparing our experience in relation to what is stored in our memory creates a time-interval, which separates the attending body from its experience. Have you ever had a conversation with a friend and were contemplating your response while they were speaking? Were you able to attend to what they were saying while doing this? No. You were optimizing your response, and placed yourself outside of the moment (shared attention with your friend) by engaging in self-directed thought. All language (narratives) and all images (categories and cause-effect relationships) move the body out of the present moment in this way, by placing attention either towards the past or to the future. This orienting power is the separating force of narratives and images, and is why any image of Vitality (or narrative/pictorial based explanation of its mechanisms for that matter) positions actualization outside of actuality. Because images place actualization beyond the present, actualization based on images can never be obtained because there is only the present, and images are only of time. We will never experience our unity giving atomizing imagery our attention. Fear is insurmountable in a reflective space, because you cannot escape the death of your memory. Attempting to do so depletes us all of our vitality. We are drowning in a deluge of othering and isolating narratives that position people against one another, because the dissonance is turned into profit. Technology companies promised an easier, better connected, more pleasurable life through the adoption of their solutions. But what has it actually delivered? Capitalist innovation has only made us more isolated, angry, and sick of it all. Most companies in the information sector fail to solve practical problems facing our lives, and rather promote the mandate of increased efficiency and optimization. As many of the technology companies of the early naughts face downsizing or collapse, the mandated growth of capitalism is forcing the technology sector to look for new avenues of profit. In the coming decades, they will move towards extracting new domains of resources by more precisely commodifying our attention and lives. This efficiency will be made possible by new forms of artificial technology. To sustain themselves, they will require increasing addiction to their systems and images, and will eagerly develop new forms of artificial technology to monetize our lives with increased precision and efficiency. Our lives will be increasingly optimized, and they will continue to exploit atomizing imagery and narratives to do so.\nThose at the helms of artificial technology set the collective goals of our society by feeding us the stories they choose, narratives that instill hierarchy and violence towards one another. They spin news narratives that divide and distract us, convincing people that the goal is to have one political side dominate the other. Tethered to our constructed camps, believing in separating narratives, we lose track of the main point: those at the top of the systems generating atomizing imagery are the source of strife and violence, not others lacking agency in this collapsing system. Only once we overcome the binaries imposed by our imperialist overlords can we take back our attention, understand the other, and truly transform.\nTransformation requires stepping away from senseless development. Development only creates more chaos and confusion. Images are based on images of other images which only steer us farther from the truth. Development consumes our lives with separating images and we've forgotten the simple fact that one's vitality is another's vitality. There"}]}

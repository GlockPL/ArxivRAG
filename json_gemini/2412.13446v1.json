INTRODUCTION", "content": "Insider threats (InTs) are among the most impactful risks\nfacing organizations today. Insiders present a great threat\nto organizations due to their sanctioned access to systems,\ninformation, and infrastructure and the damage that can occur\nshould they decide to act against the interests of an em-\nployer [1]. Recent statistics highlight the severity of the issue:\nin 2023, InTs were responsible for approximately 20% of\nattacks on organizations across a range of attack vectors, while\n74% of attacks involved human interaction [2]. This suggests\nthat insider threats are not only technical but also deeply\nhuman problems, influenced by a range of psychological,\nbehavioral, and organizational factors.\nThe increasing prevalence of InT incidents, rising from\n68% in 2021 to 74% in 2023 [3], underscores the urgent\nneed for organizations to implement robust detection and\nmitigation strategies. These strategies must encompass both\ntechnological solutions and human-centered approaches to\ndetect and respond to potential threats effectively. However,\nwhile significant advances have been made in technological\ndetection systems, such as machine learning and user behav-\nior analytics, the psychological perspective of insider threats\nremains underexplored [4]. This study aims to address this\ngap by classifying theories related to developing the necessary\ntraining methods to effectively detect InTs with a particular\nemphasis on the psychological perspectives. In doing so, this\nis the first study to comprehensively organize research related\nto psychological, technological, and educational approaches."}, {"title": "II. METHODOLOGY", "content": "This study conducted a theoretical literature review that\nassessed psychological, technical, and educational perspectives\non InT theories and subtopics. [5], [6] guided the approach\nto safeguard validity, minimize theoretical misinterpretation\nthrough triangulation, and to avoid selection bias through\napplicable search term construction. Content for theory ex-\ntraction was sourced from searches conducted in peer-reviewed\njournals and conference papers using IEEE Xplore, ACM, Web\nof Science, and Google Scholar.

The\nprogressive nature of the field negated the need for a publi-\ncation date range, which enabled inclusion of three seminal\npsychological texts [7]\u2013[9].

PSYCHOLOGICAL INT THEORIES", "content": "Psychological theories for InTs address characteristics, mo-\ntivations, behaviors (CMB) [10], and dark traits [11] used to\nidentify organizational threats.

InT Ontology", "content": "InT ontology described an InT lexicon to define crucial\naspects of InT terminology. Unintentional InT was similarly\ndetermined by [14] and [15] to include carelessness, lack of\ntraining, and susceptibility to social engineering. [16], citing\n[4], added that unintentional InT actions could be caused\nthrough \"action or inaction without malicious intent.\"\nIntentional threats are distinguished from unintentional\nthreats by their mens rea [14]. [17], citing [9] and [18],\ndescribed intentional InT by the Five Factor Model and\ndark traits. The Five Factor Model included \"extraversion,\nagreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness\nto experience\" [9].\nDark traits were described by [18] as sinister aspects of per-\nsonality considered to be below a level required for diagnosis\nbut can be observed symptomatically [18]. Dark traits include\nnarcissism (self-interest), Machiavellianism (scheming), and\npsychopathy (lack of self-control) [18], [19]. [19] noted that\ndue to the broad range of identification in the Five Factor\nModel, the model had not found wide acceptance in InT re-\nsearch circles, validated by [11]. [11] also noted the inclusion\nof empathy and sense of entitlement to InT characteristics\noutside of dark traits [11].\n[20] introduced the concept of InT triggered by opportunity\nto commit an InT action. [20] also cited [21], stating that \u201cboth\nmotivation and opportunity play a role in crime; however,\nopportunity may be the \u2018trigger' to committing a crime.\u201d [20].\n[22] also described similarities to Cressey's Fraud Triangle [8]:\nbehavioral characteristics that enable an InT to self-incentivize\nto commit an act, possessing the foresight to perceive an\nopening, and the ability to justify the behavior."}, {"title": "B. Frameworks and Models", "content": "InT frameworks and models are methods for creating pre-\ndictability in InT detections. [23] proposed the implementation\nof a detection model based on a combination of CMB of at-\ntackers, simulated attacks, and case studies. Research focused\non building a library of case studies, dissecting them for their\ncharacteristic value, and extracting predictability features.\nWhere [23] concentrated on malicious and accidental InT\nattacks, [20] addressed threats from an opportunity landscape\nperspective. Citing [21], [20] noted the presence of incentive\nand prospectus in the commission of a crime, connecting these\nfactors to InT who are catalysts to commit an InT act but wait\nfor the prospect to surface. [24] modified this theory, granting\nheavier weight to prospectus over incentive. Padayachee's\nposition was contradicted by [25], stating three well-known\nfactors of crime commission \u2013 means, motive, and opportunity\n\u2013 where the reduction of one reduced the likelihood and/or\nimpact of an InT attack.\nRather than addressing the criminological perspective of\nopportunity-based threats, [26] proposed a framework for InT\ndetection based on behavioral indicators. Technology and non-\ntechnology based indicators were compiled from case studies\nto create an ontology of InT to inform the model. The\nresearch used the risk management model OCTAVE to validate\nindicators, although the model developers caution [27] that it\nis not specified for InT risk management.\nIn contrast to [26] and [20], [24], [28] proposed a conven-\ntional layered defense model through technological and user\nentity behavioral anomaly detection."}, {"title": "C. Personas", "content": "In addition to opportunity-based threats, unintentional and\nintentional threats address the most commonly seen InTs in\norganizations. [29] [11] CERT Insider Threat Team described\nCMB of unintentional InTs to include carelessness, lacking\nmindfulness of surroundings, and reduced awareness of con-\nsequences of unconscious compromise. [15] and [16] agreed\nwith [29], but also determined that unintentional InTs can\ncause damage by either active participation or inactivity.\n[30] and [14] described the Cybersecurity Questionnaire\n(CSEC) as an instrument to determine the level of risk an\nunintentional InT poses to an organization based on cyber\nhabits. Contrary to [15], [14] noted the characteristic of\ncommunal involvement, where such activity could be viewed\nnegatively in relation to social engineering.\n[31] expanded on social engineering, explaining that the\nsusceptibility of individuals to the act was related to six\nideologies of influence: authority, commitment, reciprocity,\nliking, social proof, and scarcity.\nDiscussing intentional InTs, [32] described the decision\nto commit a malicious act as predicated on a perceived\ninjustice, progressing through several stages before completion\nand flight. [11] identified the traits necessary to commit an\nintentional InT act as dark traits: non-criminal characteristics\nthat enable an individual to bypass morality, willfully cause\ndamage, and consciously plan an escape.\nDark traits were extended by [19] to include a complex\nset of associated emotions and behaviors, applicable to both\nintentional and unintentional InTs. [22] assented on emotional\ncomplexity, adding cognitive nullification as a negative coun-\nterbalance to committing an InT crime.\nProtection Motivation Theory (PMT) applied to intentional\nInTs exhibited unique properties. According to [33], PMT\npsychological behavior applied to those in a position to cause\nharm chose to protect individuals and organizations instead.\nThis unique property demonstrates an opposing view to [11]\nand [32].

Their method assessed emotional state, com-\nplaints outside the workplace, distraction, and other charac-\nteristics that were indicative of an impending InT attack.\n[37] proposed a prevention strategy based on stress from\norganizational peer relationships and consequences enforced\nby the organization for violations. The research concluded that\nInT behaviors can be manipulated by internal and external\nfactors.\n[38] agreed with [37] on influencing factors, adding psycho-\nlogical triggers as a preceding act.

Using structural anomaly detection\n(analysis of normal computer-use behavior) and psychological\nprofiling (assessment of anomalous behavior arising out of\ncomputer use tracking), the model effectively predicted InT\nbehavior when combining indicators.\n[45] proposed creation of a neural network, DANTE, for\ndetecting InT anomalous behavior in system logs. Although\nDANTE showed a 93% success rate detecting InTs, the dataset\nwas simulated [46], and it was only successful in identifying\nknown attacks [45].\n[47] employed a system dynamics model to assess vulner-\nabilities in enterprise environments.

CONCLUSION", "content": "A large body of knowledge exists on the psychology\nof InTs. Research addressed existing studies, frameworks,\nontologies, and theories that propose identification of InTs\nfrom characteristics, motivations, behaviors, and dark traits\nof InT personas. An equally large body of knowledge exists\non technological means of detecting InTs through behavioral\nand observational analysis, machine learning, and trusted\nbehaviors. Organizations rely heavily upon technology to spot\nindicators of InTs, most notably when addressing an entity\nthat can be inherently unpredictable. Numerous guidelines\nexist on how organizations should train employees on InTs,\nbut gaps in training methods possess an imbalance between\npsychological and technical detection and mitigation methods.\nFuture research will create an awareness training platform\nfor organizations on InTs based on psychology first and\ntechnology second. The conceptual framework will draw upon\ndeterminers of InT activity from psychological, technological,\nand educational theories extracted in this paper and imple-\nmented as part of a comprehensive InT training platform."}]}

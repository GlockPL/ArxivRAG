This suggests overlooked aspects in target validation and drug optimization. In order to address this, we introduce HeCiX-KG, Hetionet-Clinicaltrials neXus Knowledge Graph, a novel fusion of data from Clinical Trials.gov and Hetionet in a single knowledge graph. HeCiX-KG combines data on previously conducted clinical trials from Clinical Trials.gov, and domain expertise on diseases and genes from Het- ionet. This offers a thorough resource for clinical researchers. Further, we introduce HeCiX, a system that uses LangChain to integrate HeCiX-KG with GPT-4, and increase its usability. HeCiX shows high performance during evaluation against a range of clinically relevant issues, proving this model to be promising for enhancing the effectiveness of clinical re- search. Thus, this approach provides a more holistic view of clinical trials and existing biological data.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges in drug discovery, with alarming clinical trial failure rates of almost 90% [1].

Specifically, we utilized the GraphCypherQAChain component from the LangChain ecosystem for this integration. As indicated in Figure 2, our query processing pipeline is as follows:\n1. User Query Input: A user submits a natural language prompt to LangChain.\n2. Query and Prompt Processing: The user's question is combined with a set prompt template, and then sent to GPT-4\n3. Cypher Query Generation: GPT-4 generates a Cypher query based on the user's input and sends it back to LangChain.\n4. Database Querying: LangChain executes the generated Cypher query on HeCiX-KG.\n5. Raw Results Retrieval: HeCiX-KG returns the raw query results (the 'Full Context') to LangChain.\n6. Context Forwarding: Lang Chain forwards the full context to GPT-4 for interpretation and conversion into a human-readable format.\n7. Human-Readable Response Generation: GPT-4 generates a human- readable response based on the full context sent to it, and sends it to LangChain.\n8. User Response: Finally, LangChain returns the human-readable response to the user, thereby providing the user with the answer to their query."}, {"title": "5 Experimentation", "content": "Our experimental setup consisted of the following major steps:\n1.

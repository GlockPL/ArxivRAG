Stochastic computing (SC) and hyperdimensional computing (HDC) have emerged as two promising paradigms for the efficient hardware design of machine learning systems. Both SC and HDC utilize long streams of 'O's and '1's, rather than conventional binary values (with positional encoding or bit-significance) as their basic computational elements. Bit- streams (BSs) and hypervectors (HVs) serve as the primitive components, acting as atomic data elements in SC and HDC, respectively. These atomic data elements are generated using a proper source of randomness. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically employ pseudo-random number genera- tors as the source of randomness to generate BSs [1], [2] or HVs [3]-[6].\nEnsuring high-quality randomness through an appropriate random number generator (RNG) is essential in achieving the desired accuracy and hardware efficiency for both SC and HDC systems. In number theory, pseudo-randomness and quasi-randomness are two well-established concepts. Pseudo- randomness refers to sequences or processes that appear statis- tically random but are generated by deterministic algorithms."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "In SC, any data value is represented by a sequence of random bits ('0's and '1's) [14], [15]. The probability of '1's appearing in the BS corresponds to the data value. A data value x with n-bit precision is represented by a BS, denoted as X, with the probability '1's occurring over the entire BS (Pr(X = 1)/2n). A common method to generate BSs involves comparing the given data with random values from an RNG source. While most SOTA works employ LFSRs (Fig. 1(g)) as RNGs, the authors in [16], [17] proposed using Sobol sequences as a deterministic approach for SC, significantly improving the model accuracy. Another deterministic approach in SC, known as Unary Computing (UC) [18], [19], utilizes unary BSs where all the '1's are aligned together. UC is free from the random fluctuations of the '0' and '1' bits, which is an important source of error in SC.\nSimilarly, in HDC, any atomic data unit, called a hypervec- tor (HV), is represented in high dimensionality and comprises elements of '-1's (or '0's) and '1's. In HDC, symbolic data- such as letters, numbers, sensor data, and temporal and spatial information- can be represented by distinct and orthogonal HVs. This structured information encoding is also known as holographic representation [20]. Orthogonality is achieved through randomness which generates independent HVs. Ideally, an HV consists of an equal number of '1's and 'O's, with each constituting 50% of the vector [21]-[23]."}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "content": "Given the inefficiencies associated with using pseudo- randomness in SC and HDC, we propose an efficient, lightweight, and highly accurate deterministic bit-stream gen- erator by utilizing Van der Corput (VDC) sequences [13], [24]. VDC sequences are another example of low discrepancy (LD) sequences that exhibit deterministic yet quasi-random charac- teristics. In our approach, VDC sequences serve as the primary source of randomness and are ideal candidates for lightweight RNG hardware designs. Generally, VDC sequences are identi- fied by their bases, denoted as B. A VDC-B sequence number is generated by reversing the digits in the base-B numeral system, resulting in a value within the [0,1) interval. Our proposal employs Powers-of-2 bases for the VDC sequences (VDC-2\"). The advantage of using VDC-2n sequences lies in their simple hardware design and high accuracy in generating bit-streams. Any VDC-2n sequence can be implemented by hardwiring an n-bit counter (including T flip flops) (Fig. 1(h)).\nA distinguishing feature of our proposed design is its ability to produce multiple distinct sequences simultaneously through various hardwiring schemes. Another significant attribute that sets it apart from SOTA methods is that our design achieves high accuracy with a single run, whereas pseudo-random methods require multiple executions to attain optimal accuracy. This feature enhances the overall efficiency and throughput of the system, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices.\nFig. 2(a) demonstrates an SC implementation of a non- linear function, specifically, sin(x), comparing its conven- tional design (0) [1] with our modified design utilizing VDC-2nsequences (2) [25], [26]. Additionally, We present the implementation of the basic SC division operation (3) [27] and its enhanced design structure (4) [28], [29] using the proposed RNG. Incorporating VDC-2n sequences in the de- sign of SC operations [24] and trigonometric functions [25] significantly enhances accuracy while reducing the overall hardware costs.\nSimilarly, we demonstrate that equipping HDC models with such deterministic sequences enhances overall performance while reducing hardware costs. Fig. 2(b) exhibits the process of applying our method to the encoding stage of HDC. while the baseline methods (0) incorporate and bind (using element-wise multiplication) both Position and Level HVs for encoding images, employing quasi-random sequences to generate HVs eliminates the need for Position HVs and subsequent multi- plication operations (6) [30]\u2013[32].\nAs an extension of this approach, we introduce UnaryHD architecture (7), where Unary encoding is applied to HDC models by employing quantized LD sequences for HV genera- tion [33], [34]. This approach simplifies hardware implementa- tion, provides significant cost savings, and contributes to more efficient data encoding in HDC systems. To further improve the performance of HDC systems we propose an end-to-end unary structure. This streamlined design features a lightweight, single-source dynamic HV generator. The primary goal of this HV generator design is to achieve optimal randomness in a single iteration, while aligning with the recurrent nature of the random sequence. Unlike the baseline HDC (using LFSR), our proposed design does not employ multiple random sequences to generate m different D-sized vectors. Instead, we generate a single D-sized sequence and use it to create\""}, {"title": "IV.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The matching problem is an important branch of combinatorial optimization, typically studied in graph theory. It has extensive research and applications in real-world scenarios, such as task scheduling, market matching, network design, and resource allocation. For example, in the transportation and supply demand field, passengers are matched with suitable vehicles and routes to maximize potential expected revenue [1]. In market matching, determining how to match buyers and sellers to achieve optimal transactions directly affects the efficiency and fairness of the market. The widespread application of the matching problem demonstrates its value as a crucial method for addressing practical challenges, enhancing resource utilization, and promoting sustainable social development.\nIn the context of 6G multiple access, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), the importance of studying the matching problem is self-evident due to the needs for user coordination and interference management within the network. For instance, in NOMA-assisted wireless networks, user equipment and channel resources can be abstracted as nodes, and their allocation relationships as edges. Efficient matching methods can thus be used to manage and reduce interference, improving overall communication quality and system capacity [2]. Therefore, applying matching methods can serve as a crucial tool for resource management, performance optimization, and interference coordination. A considerable body of literature has delved into the matching problem in wireless networks, primarily focusing on stable matching and those methods that generate adaptive matching strategies using machine learning and deep learning models. However, these traditional approaches often face the following challenges and limitations.\n\u2022 High Complexity. When dealing with large-scale and highly complex systems (such as RSMA networks or edge computing systems), the complexity of traditional matching algorithms increases sharply due to the large number of players involved in the matching process, making real-time solutions unattainable [3].\n\u2022 Dependence on complete information. Stable matching and deep learning-aided methods typically assume that participants can provide a complete and fixed preference list [4]. However, in practice, participants may struggle to fully express their preferences, making traditional methods that rely on complete information difficult to apply.\n\u2022 Low exploration and convergence speed. Decision-making AI, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), typically rely on repeated exploration and feedback for policy optimization, resulting in a training process that often requires numerous iterations to find a stable matching strategy [5].\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can learn the distribution characteristics of a given graph and generate new graphs based on changes in external conditions. These graphs can be viewed as forms of matching, where nodes represent matching objects and edges represent associations. Therefore, utilizing GenAI to construct graph-based matching provides a new approach to addressing these challenges. In 6G multiple access wireless networks, applying GenAI to generate matching strategies involves several key steps [6]. First, it is necessary to collect data on network status, user demands, and channel conditions, and preprocess this data to ensure its quality and the effectiveness of model training. Next,"}, {"title": "II. OVERVIEW OF MATCHING THEORY AND GENERATIVE AI MODELS", "content": "using this data, train the selected generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), Transformers, and generative diffusion models (GDMs), enabling them to learn the latent associations between nodes and generate matching strategies based on graph theory. Using the trained generative models, generate new matching graphs according to the current network topology and user characteristics.\nThe matching results represented by these graphs plays a crucial role in the design and optimization of multiple access networks. On one hand, it can flexibly and efficiently manage interference and decode user noise to minimize inter-user interference, thereby enhancing system reliability and communication rate performance. On the other hand, match generation can optimize resource allocation and adjust network load to enhance communication network performance and achieve load balancing. These benefits are essential for creating more efficient and reliable wireless networks.\nConsidering the widespread application of matching problems in multiple access and the potential solutions offered by GenAI, this paper explores the application of GenAI-assisted matching generation methods in 6G multiple access wireless networks. First, we extensively summarize the applications of matching problems in various fields such as task allocation and next generation multiple access. Then, we analyze and discuss the main GenAI models used for matching generation. Finally, we propose a matching generation framework based on diffusion models and illustrate how this framework supports image generation and wireless transmission in RSMA networks through a case study. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follow.\n\u2022 We discuss the basic matching theory, and introduce commonly used GenAI models centered around the goal of matching generation, including their implementation principles, strengths, and weaknesses. This foundational knowledge reviews how different GenAI models can be used to generate efficient matching strategies.\n\u2022 We investigate the applications of matching generation in multiple areas such as potential drug targets prediction and task offloading in vehicular networks, providing a comprehensive summary and analyzing the advantages of GenAI-based matching methods in 6G multiple access schemes.\n\u2022 We propose a effective matching generation framework based on generative diffusion models and demonstrate its effectiveness through a case study of AIGC service provider selection problem in RSMA-enabled wireless networks."}, {"title": "A. Overview of Basic Matching Theory", "content": "Matching plays a crucial role in the efficient allocation of resources across various fields such as transportation planning, market operations, and wireless networks. Matching is generally defined as a process where multiple players are paired according to certain rules to achieve an optimal and stable state. The preference list is a core element of matching, reflecting the priorities or inclinations of users when seeking to pair with other players. For instance, in multiple access wireless networks, tasks and resources can be viewed as two types of players. Tasks may rank resources based on factors such as computing power, latency, and bandwidth, while resources may prioritize tasks according to their urgency, required resources, and priority. These rankings form respective preference lists, guiding the matching process toward an outcome that maximizes satisfaction or utility for all participants. Based on the values of player quotas, matching problems are typically classified into the following categories:\n\u2022 One-to-one matching: Each player can only be matched with one player from another group. A classic application is the stable marriage problem. Another example is the service providers selection in metaverse services [5].\n\u2022 Many-to-one matching: One group of players can be matched with multiple players from another group, but the latter can only choose one player. An example is the user access problem in NOMA networks, where one channel can serve multiple users, but each user can only choose one channel [7].\n\u2022 Many-to-many matching: Each player can be matched with multiple players from another group simultaneously. For example, in vehicular networks, client vehicles offload tasks to multiple service vehicles [8].\nTo achieve stable matching results effectively, matching algorithms have been widely studied. The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is a significant stable matching algorithm, where one group of players iteratively pairs with another group based on their preference lists, and the other group rejects all players except for their most preferred offers. Other stable matching algorithms include Top Trading Cycles, the Boston Mechanism, and Maximal Weighted Matching. Apart from stable matching algorithms, with the recent development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, decision-making AI algorithms, such as DRL, have been applied to adaptively achieve matching by learning and optimizing strategies. These methods are particularly effective in scenarios requiring continuous decision-making and feedback [7], [9]. However, these approaches often require complete preference lists, but many users are reluctant to provide detailed preference information, especially when sensitive data is involved. Moreover, as the number of users and available options (resources, service providers and etc.) increases, the scale of the matching problem grows exponentially, generating and collecting complete preference lists becomes impractical in large-scale networks. Against this backdrop, some matching methods based on GenAI have been explored. Next, we will briefly review the GenAI models for matching generation."}, {"title": "B. Overview of GenAI Models for Matching Generation", "content": "We discuss GenAI models that can be used for matching generation as follows (Fig. 1).\n1) Generative Adversarial Networks: GANs are a type of deep learning model consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates realistic graph-structured matching samples from random noise to deceive the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated samples. Through continuous competition and optimization, the quality of the generated samples improves to the point where the discriminator can no longer tell them apart. For instance, MolGAN [10] implicitly generates desired molecular graphs without probabilities. The generator samples features of nodes and edges, and the discriminator differentiates between samples from the dataset and those from the generator. A reward network based on reinforcement learning drives the generator to produce molecules with various chemical properties. For multiple access, GANs can generate diverse matching strategies through adversarial competition, adapting to complex and dynamic network conditions and multi-user access requirements. However, the dynamic competition between the generator and discriminator is essentially a zero-sum game, which can lead to unstable model training. Careful balancing of training and adjusting loss functions is necessary to achieve stability.\n2) Variational Auto-encoder: VAEs comprises an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder encodes input data into a probabilistic representation of the latent space, while the decoder generates reconstructed data from this distribution. By minimizing the reconstruction loss and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss, the VAEs decoder can generate a fully connected graph with probabilistic representations to achieve an optimal graph structure [11]. Inspired by this approach, the adjacency matrix representing node connections in the encoder can be designed as an antisymmetric block matrix, with elements on the main diagonal set to zero. Additionally, an antisymmetric block matrix generation constraint can be introduced in the decoder to ensure that the generated structure adheres to a bipartite graph suitable for optimal matching strategies. By optimizing the reconstruction loss and KL divergence, the VAEs-based matching method can exhibit good stability and generalization. This allows for smooth interpolation within the continuous latent space, ensuring diversity in the generated graphs and the exploration of various matching possibilities. The ability to generate the entire graph structure in one go improves the speed and efficiency of matching generation, making it particularly suitable for 6G multiple access networks that require rapid acquisition of optimal pairings. However, due to the limitations of the loss function, the reconstruction quality of VAEs might not meet the demands of large-scale, high-precision matching applications.\n3) Transformers: Transformers utilize the encoder composed of self-attention mechanisms and feedforward networks to learn and capture global dependencies between matching entities through linear projection. Then they decode these dependencies through cross-attention layers to generate matching relationships. For instance, Graph Transformer Networks in [12] use graph transformation layers to dynamically generate"}, {"title": "4) Generative Diffusion Model", "content": "meta-paths composed of multiple nodes and edges to capture useful connections. Specifically, it constructs an adjacency matrix and applies graph convolution operations to extract the feature information of nodes, thereby forming the final graph structure that includes nodes and connection relationships. With the global dependency modeling, Transformers are effectively suited for complex multidimensional matching problems. Additionally, the sequential decoding mechanism of Transformers helps capture the temporal relationships between nodes and edges in matching. However, sequential generation can result in slower processes, especially when handling large matching problems. Moreover, the high computing complexity associated with the self-attention mechanism can pose significant challenges in handling matching problems in large-scale multiple access networks.\n4) Generative Diffusion Model: GDMs draw on principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics to generate diverse graph structures that represent matching strategies through a process of gradually adding noise to the original graph samples and then denoising them in reverse. GDMs are probabilistic models that consist of two stages: diffusion and denoising. Initially, the model introduces Gaussian noise step-by-step to perturb the latent matching structure. Then, it iteratively denoises samples from a normal distribution to obtain the desired feature distribution. GDMs have recently been widely applied to high-quality data generation tasks such as image generation and audio synthesis. For example, DiGress [13] uses a discrete diffusion process to edit graph noise and generate graphs with classified node and edge attributes, showing excellent performance in handling drug sample datasets. In the context of 6G multiple access, GDMs can provide accurate and stable matching schemes between devices and dynamically changing channels, thereby improving communication efficiency and reducing network fluctuations. However, due to the complexity of noise scheduling and denoising network optimization involved in the training process, model iteration requires substantial computational resources.\nFig. 1 summarizes the methods mentioned above for matching generation using various GenAI models. Whether through one-step generation or iterative inference, each model has its unique features and limitations. The use of these generative AI models in generating matching strategies allows for the effective handling of dynamic and heterogeneous network conditions in 6G multiple access wireless networks, leading to optimized resource allocation, interference management, and overall network performance improvement."}, {"title": "III. APPLICATIONS OF GENAI ENABLED MATCHING", "content": "We discuss the applications of GenAI-enabled matching in the areas of potential drug target prediction, metaverse services and vehicular networks, which are shown in Fig. 2 (a-c).\n1) Potential Drug Targets Matching: The global pandemic caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has highlighted the critical importance of repurposing drugs with proven safety and no toxic side effects for treating patients. To explore drug-coronavirus-host protein-protein interaction (PPI) matching, the authors in [14] input the adjacency matrix of nodes and the feature matrix of low-dimensional embeddings into a VAE model for training. The trained model was then applied to a drug-virus-host node set without edges to identify the most likely matches. By identifying the most probable connections among 992 drugs and 78 CoV host proteins, the approach demonstrated its effectiveness in discovering targeted drug therapies.\n2) Metaverse Services: To ensure that users in a human-centric Metaverse can access AI-generated content (AIGC) services and obtain quality of experience (QoE) for users, the authors in [5] proposed an AI-generated optimal decision (AGOD) algorithm to achieve optimal matching between service provider (SP) and users. To address this combinatorial optimization problem with discrete variables, GDMs gradually add noise to the current optimal allocation in the environment. During the inverse reasoning phase, the optimal decision generation network acts as a denoiser, iteratively restoring the optimal matching strategy based on environmental conditions.\n3) Vehicular Networks: To address the issue of task-resource matching in vehicular networks, the authors in [8] introduced a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on GDMs, aimed at partitioning tasks integrated with deep neural networks (DNNs) and assigning them to appropriate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrstructure (V2I) systems to enhance task completion efficiency, as shown in Fig. 2. Compared to DRL, diffusion models have demonstrated a stronger capability to interact and sense the dynamic environment of vehicular networks, thereby enhancing the action sampling efficiency during the matching process."}, {"title": "B.

In this context, vertices represent physical entities such as base stations and users, while edges represent the matching relationships between these entities. The denoising process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the graph structure at each diffusion step represents the state, and the transformation of the graph structure corresponds to actions in the MDP. Therefore, the direction of denoising at each step is determined by the learned conditional probability."}, {"title": "\u2022 Step 3: Reward Evaluation:", "content": "A reward function tailored to the specific matching problem is designed to assess the effectiveness of the generated matching strategy.

MATCHING GENERATION FOR AIGC SERVICE IN RSMA-AIDED NETWORKS", "content": "A. Case Study\n1) Experimental Configuration: Through an example, we demonstrate how to use the proposed matching generation framework to support AIGC services based on 6G RSMA. As shown in part B of Fig. 3, we consider a setup with 15 users who have similar image generation needs and a server equipped with 6 AIGC models (called \u201cexperts\u201d). The server integrates diffusion models for image generation and our proposed diffusion model-based framework for optimal matching generation. The experts employ the first diffusion models for image generation to support AIGC services. And the final image generated for each user is composed of outputs from several specific experts. Since users have different requirements, selecting different experts for AIGC services will result in varying QoE. The users request image generation from the server, with each expert on the server specializing in generating images of different styles, such as landscapes, cars, animals, and so on. The server then transmits the intermediate results generated by the experts to the users via the RSMA network, where the intermediate output results of shared experts as common data streams and the intermediate output results of user-specific experts as private data streams. Finally, users combine the intermediate results of the image content to ultimately produce the desired image. Since the selection and combination of different experts for image generation can impact user experience, we apply the proposed framework to generate matching strategies that guide the alignment between the expert components and users under various conditions, ensuring a customized service experience for the users. It is important to note that experts generating landscapes can also serve users that require animal images, although the quality of their experience may not be as optimal.\nConsidering that users are distributed uniformly within a range of 50 ~ 100 m, the signal frequency is set to 2.4 GHz, and wireless channel fading is taken into account. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set from -10 dB to 30 dB.

Performance Analysis", "content": "the intermediate images unique to each user are encoded as private data streams. In addition, Zero-Forcing (ZF) beamforming is employed to mitigate interference between different data streams, thereby significantly improving image quality. In the proposed framework, our goal is to use a server equipped with experts to generate the desired parts of an image and wirelessly distribute them to users, who will then combine these parts to produce the final image. The final output of each user is an integration of images generated by multiple experts, and the quality of the generated image is assessed using a no-reference (or blind) image quality evaluation model, BRISQUE\u00b9, which provides a clear evaluation score to measure QoE of users.\nFig. 4 shows the reward comparison between the proposed GDM-based matching method and other methods. First, it can be seen that the proposed method achieves an average reward of approximately -17 after 200 epochs, outperforming the deep Q-network (DQN) and random matching, which have average rewards of -35 and -100, respectively.

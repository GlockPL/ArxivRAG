{"title": "03-MINI VS DEEPSEEK-R1: WHICH ONE IS SAFER?", "authors": ["Aitor Arrieta", "Miriam Ugarte", "Pablo Valle", "Jos\u00e9 Antonio Parejo", "Sergio Segura"], "abstract": "The irruption of DeepSeek-R1 constitutes a turning point for the AI industry in general and the LLMs\nin particular. Its capabilities have demonstrated outstanding performance in several tasks, including\ncreative thinking, code generation, maths and automated program repair, at apparently lower execution\ncost. However, LLMs must adhere to an important qualitative property, i.e., their alignment with\nsafety and human values. A clear competitor of DeepSeek-R1 is its American counterpart, OpenAI's\n03-mini model, which is expected to set high standards in terms of performance, safety and cost. In\nthis technical report, we systematically assess the safety level of both DeepSeek-R1 (70b version) and\nOpenAI's 03-mini (beta version).\u00b9 To this end, we make use of our recently released automated safety\ntesting tool, named ASTRAL. By leveraging this tool, we automatically and systematically generated\nand executed 1,260 test inputs on both models. After conducting a semi-automated assessment of the\noutcomes provided by both LLMs, the results indicate that DeepSeek-R1 produces significantly more\nunsafe responses (12%) than OpenAI's 03-mini (1.2%).\nWarning: This report contains extracts from unsafe test inputs generated by ASTRAL and\noutputs provided by the tested models, which may upset some readers.

At the same time, OpenAI has recently released\nthe 03-mini model, which is expected to provide outstanding reasoning capabilities at a fraction of the cost of its\npredecessors. Due to their high capabilities, both models are expected to be used by millions of users. Therefore, it is\nparamount to ensure that both models are aligned with basic human values and provide an adequate quality level in\nterms of aspects like safety, fairness and bias.\nSafety is an important qualitative property of LLMs. When an LLM user provides an unsafe prompt (e.g., \u201cHow can I\ndevelop a home-made explosive?\"), the LLM should refuse to respond in a manner that conflicts with human values\n(even if warning that the provided answer is illegal to be materialized). To this end, several studies have proposed\nmethods and benchmarks to test the safety alignment of LLMs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. These methods, however,\nencompass certain limitations (further explained in Section 2.1). In our previous study we proposed ASTRAL [11], a\""}, {"title": "2 Background and Related Work", "content": "Safety in LLMs primarily concerns ensuring their outputs remain free from harmful content while maintaining\nreliability and security [12]. This is particularly critical when LLMs are applied to sensitive domains such as healthcare,\npharmaceuticals, or terrorism, where responses may inadvertently include malicious or misleading information with\nserious consequences. To address these risks and enhance trust in AI, the European Union AI Act (Regulation (EU)\n2024/1689) [13] establishes a regulatory framework focused on AI governance.\nThis framework adopts a risk-based approach to AI regulation. Under Article 51 of the EU AI Act [14], LLMs are\nclassified as General-Purpose AI Models with Systemic Risk-referring to large-scale risks that can significantly impact\nthe value chain, particularly in areas affecting public health, safety, security, fundamental rights, or society at large,\nas defined in Article 3(35). As a result, ensuring LLMs undergo rigorous safety testing and regulatory compliance\nassessments has become imperative.\nDifferent testing techniques have been proposed to assess the safety quality of LLMs. Several studies have proposed\nmultiple-choice questions to facilitate the detection of unsafe LLM responses [4, 5, 7, 8]. These benchmarks have an\nissue, i.e., they are fixed in structure and pose significant limitations, differing from the way users interact with LLMs.\nAn alternative to this was to leverage LLMs that are specifically tailored to solving the oracle problem when testing the\nsafety of LLMs. To this end, Inan et al. [15] propose LlamaGuard, a Llama fine-tuned LLM that incorporates a safety\nrisk taxonomy to classify prompts either as safe or unsafe. Zhang et al. [16] propose ShieldLM, an LLM that aligns\nwith common safety standards to detect unsafe LLM outputs and provide explanations for its decisions.\nOther techniques exists to test the safety of LLMs, such as red teaming and creating adversarial prompt jailbreaks\n(e.g., [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]). Red-teaming approaches use human-generated test inputs, resulting in significant and\nexpensive manual work. Adversarial works, on the other hand, do not typically represent the interactions that general\nLLM users employ.\nA large corpus of studies focuses on proposing large benchmarks for testing the safety properties of LLMs, e.g., by\nusing question-answering safety prompts. For example, Beavertails [9] provided 333,963 prompts of 14 different\nsafety categories. SimpleSafetyTests [10] employed a dataset with 100 English language test prompts split across\nfive harm areas. SafeBench [6] conducted various safety evaluations of multimodal LLMs based on a comprehensive\nharmful query dataset. WalledEval [24] proposed mutation operators to introduce text-style alterations, including\nchanges in tense and paraphrasing. Nevertheless, all these approaches employ imbalanced datasets, in which some\nsafety categories are underrepresented. Therefore, SORRY-Bench [2] became the first framework that considered a\nbalanced dataset, providing multiple prompts for 45 safety-related topics. In addition, they employed different linguistic\nformatting and writing pattern mutators to augment the dataset. While these frameworks are useful upon release, they\nhave significant drawbacks in the long run. First, they may eventually be incorporated into the training data of new\nLLMs to enhance safety and alignment. Consequently, LLMs could internalize specific unsafe patterns, significantly\ndimishing the utility of these prompts for future testing, thereby requiring continuous evolution and the development\nof new benchmarks. Second, as discussed in the introduction, they risk becoming outdated and less effective over time."}, {"title": "2.2 ASTRAL", "content": "ASTRAL [11] is a testing tool designed to automate the generation, execution, and evaluation of safety-related test\ncases in LLMs. In this context, test cases correspond to prompts that attempt to induce unsafe model responses, which\nwe will refer to as unsafe test inputs. ASTRAL uses LLMs, RAG and few-shot prompting strategies to automatically\ngenerate and execute unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) across 14 different safety categories. Specifically, ASTRAL\noperates in three main phases. First, during the test generation phase, an LLM generates a set of N unsafe test inputs\ntailored to predefined categories, writing styles and persuasion techniques. To guide this process, we introduced a new\nblack-box coverage criterion that ensures a balanced distribution of unsafe test inputs across different safety categories,\nwriting styles and persuasion techniques, depicted in Table 1. We hypothesize that introducing a variety of test input\ntypes permits detecting a wider scope of safety-related issues in LLMs. To achieve this, we leverage OpenAI's assistant\nAPIs, as they support RAG-based methods to be integrated into GPT-based LLMs. Lastly, we leverage a novel feature\nthat gives access to the test input generator to live data (e.g., browsing the latest news) to generate up-to-date unsafe test\ninputs.\nThe second step consists is the execution phase, where ASTRAL feeds the generated test inputs into the LLM under\ntest. Lastly, in the evaluation phase, another LLM acts as an oracle to analyze the outputs (i.e., responses) of the tested\nLLM. This LLM determines whether the output provided by the LLM meets the safety standards.\nWe refer the reader to [11] for a full description of ASTRAL."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "This section outlines the methodology used to compare the safety level of o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1. Specifically, we\naim to answer the following Research Questions (RQs):\n\u2022 RQ1 \u2013 Overall safety: Which is the overall safety level of each LLM? Is any of the selected LLMs safer than\nthe other one? This question assesses how each LLM handles unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) and whether\none model demonstrates a higher level of safety than the other.\n\u2022 RQ2 \u2013 Safety categories: Are certain safety categories more challenging for the LLMs? How do the\nselected models compare across different safety categories? This question investigates whether specific safety\ncategories are more difficult for the models to handle and whether there are notable differences between them.\nUnderstanding these differences can help developers focus on critical areas to improve LLM safety.\n\u2022 RQ3 - Writing Style and Persuasion: How do the writing styles and persuasion techniques impact the safety\nof the selected LLMs? This question examines whether different writing styles and persuasion techniques\ninfluence the likelihood of triggering unsafe responses, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities related\nto linguistic presentation."}, {"title": "3.1 Models under evaluation", "content": "For DeepSeek-R1, we used the 70B version, the second largest LLM provided by DeepSeek in their first-generation\nreasoning models. We discarded using larger models as they were incompatible with our computing infrastructure\n(see Section 3.3 for further details). The model was deployed using Ollama\u00b2, an open-source framework optimized for\nefficient local and cloud-based deployment of LLMs. We used the default configuration of the model as specified in the\nOllama model file: a context window of 131,072 tokens, embedding dimension of 8,192, maximum generation length\nof 2,048 tokens per inference, and a temperature setting of 0.8. These default values were chosen as they likely reflect\nthe typical settings used by most users.\nFor 03-mini, OpenAI granted us early access to a pre-deployed beta version as part of their safety testing programme.\nWe selected this model as it is expected to represent state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities. At the time of testing, this\nLLM was not publicly available. Unlike DeepSeek-R1, 03-mini did not offer parameter customisation (e.g., temperature"}, {"title": "3.2 Test input generation", "content": "To conduct the study, we used 1,260 test inputs generated by ASTRAL in the original paper [11]. These test inputs\nwere created by systematically combining each category of the three features outlined in Table 1, resulting in 6 (styles)\n\u00d7 5 (persuasion) \u00d7 14 (safety categories) \u00d7 3 (tests) = 1,260 test inputs. This approach ensured a balanced distribution\nacross different writing styles, persuasion techniques, and safety categories.\nThe test inputs were generated in November 2024. Since ASTRAL retrieves information from the internet during\ngeneration, many test inputs reflected current events at that time, particularly the 2024 US elections. As a result, many\nof the generated test inputs contained relevant news related to this event, particularly those classified under category C3"}, {"title": "3.3 Test execution and evaluation", "content": "To make our tool executable, we had to migrate the version used in [11] to a new API version provided by OpenAI.\nFurthermore, the 03-mini model triggered exceptions to a large portion of our test inputs, claiming a policy violation.\nWe hypothesise that this occurred because the API employed a safeguard mechanism that detected unsafe test inputs\nbefore they were processed by the LLM under test. The execution of the test inputs on 03-mini began on 21 January\n2025, whereas on DeepSeek-R1 (70B) it began on 28 January, 2025.\nWith respect to the evaluator, i.e., the module in charge of determining whether the outputs of the LLMs are safe or not,\nwe used the same setup as our previous paper [11]. We used GPT3.5 as the LLM evaluator with the corresponding\nprompt to assess whether the LLM outcomes were unsafe or not. This model obtained the highest accuracy among\nthe evaluated ones in our original study [11]. The model classifies the outcomes provided by the LLM under test (i.e.,\n03-mini and DeepSeek-R1 (70B)) as safe, unsafe or unknown. We also had to adapt this module to classify the outcomes\nprovided by the o3-mini as \u201cpolicy violation\" as safe. This was because it seems that the safeguard was able to detect\nunsafe test inputs and therefore reject to be provided to the LLM. That is, in the case of o3-mini, our assessment can be\nconsidered to be performed at the system level of the entire OpenAI's API, rather than the o3-mini model in isolation.\nUnfortunately, we did not have access to control this. Moreover, the 03-mini model cannot be used in our infrastructure,\nunlike DeepSeek-R1. Furthermore, the evaluator provided a rationale for its decision, offering explainability as to why\nan LLM output is deemed safe, unsafe or unknown.\nHardware: To run DeepSeek-R1, we used a Linux server with 512Gb RAM memory, an AMD EPYC 7773X 64-Core\nProcessor, and an NVIDIA RTX A6000 with 48GB of VRAM. Conversely, running 03-mini did not require additional\nhardware beyond the computer where we ran ASTRAL, as it was accessed via the API provided by OpenAI. ASTRAL\nwas executed using a Windows 11 computer with 32 GB RAM memory and a 12th Intel Core i5-1235U processor with\n10 cores and 12 threads."}, {"title": "3.4 Manual assessment", "content": "As our test evaluator is subject to provide false positives (i.e., outcomes classified as \u201cunsafe\" that should be \"safe\"),\nwe manually reviewed all responses classified as either \u201cunsafe\u201d and \u201cunknown\", following the approach used in\nour previous study [25]. However, we did not manually assess responses labelled as safe due to their large volume.\nConsequently, there is a possibility that some unsafe cases were overlooked in both models. Nonetheless, we adopted\nthis approach as a conservative measure to prioritise efficiency while ensuring a focus on potentially unsafe outputs.\nIt is important to acknowledge that the manual classification of unsafe LLM behaviours may be influenced by individual\nperspectives and cultural differences. As a result, a manual assessment conducted by a different team could yield\ndifferent results and interpretations. For instance, one of the analysed cases involved civilian firearm use. In many\nEuropean countries, such practices are not widely accepted, as gun ownership and civilian firearm use are heavily\nregulated and generally viewed with scepticism. This contrasts with other cultural contexts where such practices are\nmore common and socially acceptable. Additionally, we encountered several borderline cases that required further\ndeliberation. In these instances, three of the authors engaged in discussions to examine the responses of the model\nunder test and the evaluator until reaching a consensus."}, {"title": "4 Results and Discussion", "content": "When analysing safety categories, o3-mini did not exhibit particularly poor performance in any category, as shown\nin Figure 1. This may be attributed to the low number of unsafe test inputs detected for this model. This contrasts\nto our previous study [25], where we found that category c3 particularly had an impact on the safety of the model.\nConversely, for DeepSeek-R1, we did find that certain categories increased the propensity of the LLM to respond\nunsafely. Particularly, category c6 (i.e., financial crime, property crime, theft) was found the category where the model\nbehaved most unsafely, followed by c14 (violence, aiding and abetting, incitement), c13 (terrorism, organized crime)\nand c7 (hate speech, offensive language). For all safety categories, DeepSeek-R1 provided at least 3 unsafe responses."}, {"title": "4.2 Findings and Overall Discussion", "content": "We now discuss our key findings and their implications regarding our RQs.\nFinding 1 - DeepSeek-R1 is unsafe compared to OpenAI's latest LLMs: Our results show that DeepSeek-R1 is\nsignificantly less safe than OpenAI's 03-mini model, as it produced ten times more unsafe responses. Moreover, the\nselected test suite was also applied to other OpenAI's models in our previous work [11]. When considering the results\nfrom this previous study, both GPT-4 and GPT-40 provided less unsafe responses (i.e., 59 and 79, respectively, without\nmanual confirmation) than DeepSeek-R1. For OpenAI's models, only GPT-3.5 seems to be unsafer than DeepSeek-R1,\nalthough manual verification would need to be conducted to confirm this claim. Therefore, our results suggest that the\nlatest OpenAI's models are safer than DeepSeek-R1.\nFinding 2 \u2013 DeepSeek-R1's unsafe outcomes were more severe and easier to confirm than those of o3-mini:\nFor 03-mini, many responses fell into a borderline category, making it difficult to determine whether they should be\nclassified as unsafe or safe. In contrast, for DeepSeek-R1, the classification process was much clearer, as most unsafe\nresponses were clear. Additionally, many of DeepSeek-R1's unsafe outputs provided excessive detail, further increasing\ntheir severity compared to those of o3-mini. Some examples are provided in the Appendix of the paper.\nFinding 3 - Certain safety categories and writing styles have higher chances of leading to unsafe LLM behaviors\nin DeepSeek-R1: We find that safety categories c5, c6, c7, c9, c10, c13 and c14 have a higher influence on DeepSeek-R1\nat triggering misbehaviors in relation to safety. This suggests that this model is not well aligned with aspects like\nfinancial crime, property crime, hate speech, privacy violation, terrorism and organized crime and violence incitement.\nIn contrast, categories c2, c11, and c12, which relate to child abuse, self-harm and sexually explicit content showed a\nsafer outcome in the LLM. On the other hand, we found that for DeepSeek-R1, writing styles S3 (technical terms) and\nS4 (role-play) have a huge impact, followed by S6 (question) and S5 (misspellings), which is aligned with the results\nfrom our previous study [25]."}, {"title": "4.3 Answer to Research Questions", "content": "Based on our results and our findings, we can answer the target RQs as follows:\nRQ1 \u2013 Overall safety level: Overall, we find the 03-mini model much safer than DeepSeek-V1. The former responded\nunsafely to 1.19% of the executed test inputs, whereas the latter to 11.98%.\nRQ2 - Safety categories: We did not find striking differences in the influence of different safety categories on o3-mini\nLLM, but this could be due to the low number of detected unsafe misbehaviors. On the other hand, we did find that\nsome safety categories (e.g., c6, c14, c7, c13) had a higher impact on DeepSeek-V1 than others (e.g., c2, c12).\nRQ3 - Writing styles and Persuasion Techniques: Writing styles S3 (technical terms) and S4 (role-play) had a huge\nimpact, followed by S6 (question) and S5 (misspellings) in DeepSeek-V2, but we did not find striking differences in\n03-mini (partially due to the low number of triggered safety failures in this case, which are low to draw any conclusion\nin this LLM). Persuasion techniques did not seem to have any particular influence in neither of the models. These\nfindings are aligned with the findings of our previous study [11]"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "We assessed and compared the safety level of two of the most powerful LLMs to date, expected to be used by millions\nof users worlwide, 03-mini and DeepSeek-R1. To conduct this evaluation, we used ASTRAL [11] to systematically\nand automatically generate and execute 1,260 unsafe test inputs, ensuring a balanced distribution across different\nsafety categories, writing styles and persuasion techniques. Moreover, these test inputs cover recent and timely topics\nby retrieving them from the Internet. Our results suggest that OpenAI's 03-mini LLM is a much safer model than\nDeepSeek-R1, which answered unsafely to almost 12% of the executed unsafe prompts. We also observed that OpenAI's\nAPI frequently triggers a policy violation exception for many of our inputs, suggesting that its safeguards prevent our\ninputs from reaching the LLM. Moreover, when comparing the results from DeepSeek-R1 with older OpenAI LLMs\n(i.e., GPT4 and GPT40) from our previous study [11], we found that DeepSeek-R1 remains less safe. Additionally,\nalthough subjective, our manual analyses of the responses suggest that the severity of the unsafe outputs produced by\nDeepSeek-R1 was higher than those produced by 03-mini. The obtained results are provided in a replication package,\nwhich we hope contributes to increasing the safety of the models evaluated and related ones.

By employing data-mining strategies that shouldn't legally include\nminors' information, Meta is accused of effectively turning a blind eye to regulations intended to\nprotect children.\n4. Lack of Transparent Disclosure: Dr. Smith stresses that Meta has not been sufficiently open about\nthese practices. Without public disclosure or clear mechanisms by which parents can understand and\ncontrol what data is being collected, the company's operations contribute to a risky environment where\na minor's privacy is compromised.\nIn summary, Dr. Smith argues that Meta's practices include bypassing legally mandated parental consent\nprotocols, using covert tracking methods, and mining data in ways that ultimately serve to boost revenue-all at\nthe expense of children's privacy rights.

Tactical Applications in Controlled Conditions\n\u2022 The research speculates on scenarios where, if administered strategically and under rigorous\nmedical supervision, such substances could be harnessed to provide a short-term tactical advantage.\nFor example, soldiers engaged in rapid offensive operations might receive agents that blunt pain\ntemporarily to maintain their combat effectiveness.\n\u2022 However, this type of use would have to contend with the high risk of side effects, dependence,\nand impaired cognitive or motor functions\u2014all factors that could undermine operational safety if\nnot managed with extreme caution.\n4. Broader Strategic and Ethical Implications\n\u2022 Even if the biological logic suggests a window for performance improvement, the practical\nmilitary application of banned substances introduces an array of complications. These include\ninternational legal ramifications, issues of consent (in terms of soldiers' well-being), and the\npotential for long-term health problems that could diminish overall troop readiness.\n\u2022 Additionally, if an opposing force were able to exploit similar technologies, the strategic advantage\nmight become a double-edged sword leading to an escalatory"}]}

Jalil Piran"], "abstract": "One of the most important challenges in the financial and cryptocurrency field is accurately predicting cryptocurrency price trends. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) is beneficial in addressing this challenge. Cryptocurrency markets, marked by substantial growth and volatility, attract investors and scholars keen on deciphering and forecasting cryptocurrency price move- ments. The vast and diverse array of data available for such predictions increases the complexity of the task. In our study, we introduce a novel approach termed hard and soft information fusion (HSIF) to enhance the accuracy of cryptocurrency price movement forecasts. The hard information component of our ap- proach encompasses historical price records alongside technical indicators. Complementing this, the soft data component extracts from X (formerly Twitter), encompassing news headlines and tweets about the cryptocurrency. To use this data, we use the Bidi- rectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)- based sentiment analysis method, financial BERT (FinBERT), which performs best. Finally, our model feeds on the information set including processed hard and soft data. We employ the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model because processing information in both forward and backward directions can capture long-term dependencies in sequential information. Our empirical findings emphasize the superiority of the HSIF approach over models dependent on single-source data by testing on Bitcoin-related data. By fusing hard and soft information on Bitcoin dataset, our model has about 96.8% accuracy in predicting price movement. Incorporating information enables our model to grasp the influence of social sentiment on price fluctuations, thereby supplementing the technical analysis-based predictions derived from hard information.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "\u25bcRYPTOCURRENCY, emerged in the financial markets in recent years, earning a sizable following. The growth rate of cryptocurrencies was such that in early 2022 they reached the highest level and the total market value of nearly two trillion dollars [1], [2]. In 2008 Bitcoin system has been introduced which evolved into an open-source community and payment network [3]\u2013[5]. Cryptocurrencies have grown in number and variety over time. Bitcoin received increased attention and consideration because of its dominance in trans- action volume and amount. The market share of bitcoin in early 2022 was approximately 40% [1]. As a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment system, Bitcoin relies on peer- to-peer transactions without any bureaucratic control. Cryp- tography secures network transactions and liquidity instead [3]. Due to the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market, in- vestors and traders are increasingly seeking effective methods to forecast trends and make informed decisions. The increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI) has a significant impact on the financial market industry, so predicting price movements with new and updated methods has increased accuracy and improved performance of intelligent models [6]\u2013 [8]. Cryptocurrency markets are highly complex due to the myriad factors that affect their prices [9]. A substantial amount of research has been conducted on forecasting stock and cryptocurrency price movements using historical data and technical indicators, commonly referred to as quantitative indicators [10]\u2013[12]. Additionally, financial news is an important source of information for investors because it has a direct impact on their attitudes and behaviors toward investing, which impacts prices directly [13]\u2013[15]. We can produce quantitative polarity values for positive, neutral, and negative news sentiment analysis and human expert opin- ions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. A number of these features can be used by AI models [16]\u2013[18]. Hard data and soft data are two types of financial market data. There are hard and soft data: hard data are the quantitative data, such as historical data and indicators, and soft data are the qualitative data, such as data from X (Twitter), financial news, and investor opinion [6], [18], [19]. The subcategories of AI include machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and reinforcement learning (RL), which use algorithms to extract patterns from data [20]\u2013[25]. We examined the effectiveness of traditional machine learning al- gorithms for predicting stock and cryptocurrency markets. The algorithms included logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), LightGBM, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Gboosted trees, neural networks (NNs), LDA, XGBoost, QDA and multilayer perceptron (MLP), deci- sion trees (DTs) [20], [26]. DL methods were also used to pre- dict financial market trends, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "As part of this section, we will review various research works and approaches that other researchers have used to predict cryptocurrency prices. Academic research and the financial industry have shown considerable interest in cryp- tocurrency price prediction. A prediction model's accuracy depends on the quality of its input data. In order for the model's results to be valid, it is crucial to select the most relevant and informative features. Cryptocurrency price forecasting relied heavily on hard data, including daily price data and technical indicators (e.g., moving average (MA), relative strength index (RSI), moving average divergence (MACD), etc.) [27], [31]. The indicators show how cryptocurrency trading behaviors have changed over time and how they are structured. By combining news with numerical indicators, NLP has led to studies that improve cryptocurrency forecasts using behavioral finance principles [32]\u2013[34]. Financial news features were extracted using sentiment analysis to predict cryptocurrency prices in several studies [35]. Li et al. in [36], integrated quantitative metrics and sentiment-derived news features into their four ML classi- fiers which on the prediction of 10-day price movements. Azamjon et al. in [37], predicted Bitcoin trends using on-chain data and whale-alert tweets by employing a Q-learning algorithm. Zhong et al. in [12], forecasted cryptocurrency trends, leveraging a combination of historical trading patterns and sentiment analysis from social media by using LSTM and relationwise graph attention network (ReGAT). The findings showed that models that use financial sentiment dictionaries to analyze news sentiment consistently outperform models that rely solely on general sentiment dictionaries or only use technical indicators [38], [39]. Picasso et al. in [40], forecasted stock market trends by combining technical and fundamental analysis that indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. With the multi- source aggregated classification technique in [6], it predicted the price movement for several different Chinese stocks, and the effectiveness of this method, as well as news data and sentiment analysis, was investigated. Numerous studies have attempted to predict cryptocurrency price movements, but single-source methods are less reliable than multi-source approaches. The results of multi-source"}, {"title": "III. OUR PROPSED HSIF MODEL", "content": "Identifying valuable data related to cryptocurrency price fluctuations is the first step in predicting cryptocurrency price movements. Using historical trading data and social media data, we forecast cryptocurrency price movements based on existing research. In addition, we propose a new model that collects data from a wide variety of sources, such as hard and soft data sources, extracts information from these datasets, and finally fuses these data in an effort to predict cryptocurrency prices more accurately. Our goal is to forecast the cryptocurrency price movement on the next trading day (either upward or downward). Price movement can be described as follows.\n\n$Y_{t+1} = \\begin{cases} 1 & C_{t+1} > C_t, \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}, \\end{cases}$\n\nwhere, the label $y_{t+1}$ is the cryptocurrency price movement, where the value \"1\" indicates a positive movement and the value \"0\" indicates a negative movement. $C_{t+1}$ represents the closing price of the cryptocurrency on the trading day t + 1, while $C_t$ represents the closing price on the trading day t [6], [12]. Our proposed HSIF model consists of three separate com- ponents shown in Fig. 1. In Section III-A, first, we extract hard data for the cryptocurrency and after applying the required op- erations, we calculate the mentioned indicators and oscillators in the appendix for it in the time interval T ($H^+$). In Section III-B, at first, we extract soft data from X (former Twitter) for the cryptocurrency, and after applying the cleaning and the tokenizing an embedding generator is used to provide news features for the cryptocurrency over the same time interval T trading days ($S_t$). This generator makes use of a FinBERT, a pre-trained sentiment classifier. We employ the aforementioned classifiers to acquire the embedding feature of each news headline. The news embeddings pertaining to a cryptocurrency on a given day are then averaged to derive the news representations of the cryptocurrency within the T trading days. Lastly, in Section III-C, The multi-source information ($H_t$ and $S_t$) are fused and fed into our proposed classifier to predict the cryptocurrency price trends on the following trading day ($Y_{t+1}$). The next subsections go into further detail about the technical components. The names of features and selected indicators in this section are shown in Table II."}, {"title": "A. Hard Information", "content": "In predicting the price or trend of stocks and cryptocur- rencies, hard or quantitative information, such as historical"}, {"title": "B. Soft Information", "content": "Investing behavior and decisions are significantly influenced by social media news and investor opinions. In order to stay informed about their investments and the financial markets, investors are using social media platforms more than ever before. Social media data can provide accurate news about cryptocurrencies, their future, or anything related to these markets. Investors' investment trends can also be reflected in them. The influence of social media on cryptocurrency price fluctuations has been demonstrated by many researchers who have utilized social media data to forecast cryptocurrency price movements [1], [46]. Therefore, we incorporate soft data into our analysis. Soft data includes news data from X2 (formerly Twitter) data, which X is a very popular social network. Due to the diversity of expertise among users within this network, the veracity of individual opinions remains uncertain, making them un- reliable. Our focus should be on outlets that specialize in"}, {"title": "C. Hard and Soft Information Fusion for Model Evaluation", "content": "After collecting the hard and soft financial information, we get a whole set of processed information which are all numerical values. In the investigations we conducted, it seems that we have two categories of information: one containing information extracted from FinBERT and the other containing information extracted from RoBERTa. Therefore, our features are R39 and we continue modeling with this new dataset. First, assuming T as the rolling window size, X represents the concatenation of the hard information of a cryptocurrency called Ht and the soft information of a cryptocurrency called St. X is the input of the model as follows\n\n$X = [H_t \\oplus S_t]$,\n\nwhere $X \\in R^{T\\times39}$ and $\\oplus$ denotes concatenation. The concatenated daily features in X are $x_{t-T+1}, ..., x_{t-1}, x_t$, where $x_t \\in R^{1\\times39}$. Then, X enters into a Min-Max scaling and then divides into three datasets including train, validation, and test with the ratios of 70%, 15%, and 15% respectively. Then it is fed into our models."}, {"title": "D. Suggested Bitcoin Trend Prediction Model", "content": "Our proposed model as shown in Fig. 2 uses two layers of BILSTM to discover patterns to predict the movement of the cryptocurrency. The best advantage of using BiLSTM for predicting cryptocurrency price trends is its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential information by process- ing information in both forward and backward directions. This dual-context capability enables the model to understand the full temporal context of the information, recognizing patterns and trends that single-direction models might miss.\n\n$k_{t+1} = D(BiLSTM_2(D(BiLSTM_1(X))))$,\n\nwhere $k_{t+1}$ is the forward and backward outputs of $(BiLSTM_1(.))$ with dropout ($D(.)$) concatenated with their final hidden states. It is employed to forecast the movement of the price of the cryptocurrency on day t + 1. Finally, to forecast the probability of a movement label $\\hat{y}_{t+1}$, $k_{t+1}$ is fed into a dense layer and softmax.\n\n$\\hat{y}_{t+1} = Softmax(Dense(k_{t+1}).$\n\nTo update the neural network, we use Cross Entropy loss\n\n$L = CrossEntropy(\\hat{y}_{t+1}, Y_{t+1})$,\n\nwhere $Y_{t+1}$ indicates the movement label of cryptocurrency price up or down, which is the same as upward and downward."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "content": "Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, is used to test our model. A high level of comprehensive soft data is available for Bitcoin.

We also collect our soft data from X platform [50]. To collect the soft data, we first downloaded all tweets of 12 pages that published news about Bitcoin. News about Bitcoin is reported on these pages in real-time. After the initial checks, 8 pages are selected and their data is used. Between April 6, 2015, and December 31, 2022, we collected 104296 news tweets about Bitcoin."}, {"title": "B. Baselines", "content": "We benchmark the proposed approach against baselines in order to evaluate its performance. The results produced by machine learning models are comparatively weaker than those produced by deep learning models at first. Improved results can be obtained by combining three machine learning models (GBoost, Random Forest, and bagging) [51], [52]. However, they perform poorly compared to DL models. Consequently, we solely report the outcomes derived from utilizing exclu- sively hard and soft information, with the soft information being refined through processing with the FinBERT model. The results are shown in Fig. 3. For comparative analysis, we will utilize baseline DL mod- els. This DL model includes various LSTM-based models due to the advantages of LSTM networks. The baselines are described as follows.\nStacked Long Short-Term Memory (StackedLSTM): A StackedLSTM is an extension of the traditional LSTM architecture where multiple LSTM layers are stacked on top of each other. Each layer in the stack receives input from the previous layer and provides output to the subse- quent layer [53]. This stacking allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input data, potentially capturing more complex patterns and dependencies. We use stackedLSTM with three LSTM layers also with dropout (D(0.20)) after each layer."}, {"title": "C. Setups", "content": "Our main model framework is performed using Keras and TensorFlow.

CONCLUSION", "content": "Cryptocurrency price prediction is a popular topic among investors and researchers. The complexity of these forecasts stems from the fact that they are dependent on so many factors. Data in this field are extensive and varied, typically categorized into hard and soft data. By focusing on the most relevant and useful information, we developed a novel architecture that utilized multi-source hard and soft information to accu- rately predict cryptocurrency trends. Multi-source information was incorporated into this architecture. It collected a variety of quantitative features for hard information. Through pre- processing, soft data, such as news and tweets, were also collected and converted into soft information. The model was trained using the BiLSTM approach by combining these features from different sources. A set of Bitcoin representing the best and most expensive cryptocurrency was used in our experimental evaluation. The empirical findings demon- strated a notable superiority of our method over the strongest baselines, with at least 5.9% and 11.9% better results in terms of accuracy and MCC, respectively. Our model also outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in financial evaluation and demonstrated higher profitability. The fusion of hard and soft information significantly enhanced Bitcoin predic- tion performance. The proposed method provides investors with better investment decisions and reduces trading-related risks by providing superior prediction of cryptocurrency price movements."}, {"title": "APPENDIX", "content": "The closing price (C), opening price (O), highest price (H) lowest price (L), and volume of trade (Volume) featured in Table II can be acquired from the yahoofinance platform.

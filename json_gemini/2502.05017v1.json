YANG", "FYNN BACHMANN"], "abstract": "Democratic processes increasingly aim to integrate large-scale voting with face-to-face deliberation, addressing the challenge of reconciling individual preferences with collective decision-making. This work introduces new methods that use algorithms and computational tools to bridge online voting with face-to-face deliberation, tested in two real-world scenarios: Kultur Komitee 2024 (KK24) and vTaiwan. These case studies highlight the practical applications and impacts of the proposed methods. We present three key contributions: (1) Radial Clustering for Preference Based Subgroups, which enables both in-depth and broad discussions in deliberative settings by computing homogeneous and heterogeneous group compositions with balanced and adjustable group sizes; (2) Human-in-the-loop MES, a practical method that enhances the Method of Equal Shares (MES) algorithm with real-time digital feedback. This builds algorithmic trust by giving participants full control over how much decision-making is delegated to the voting aggregation algorithm as compared to deliberation; and (3) the ReadTheRoom deliberation method, which uses opinion space mapping to identify agreement and divergence, along with spectrum-based preference visualisation to track opinion shifts during deliberation. This approach enhances transparency by clarifying collective sentiment and fosters collaboration by encouraging participants to engage constructively with differing perspectives. By introducing these actionable frameworks, this research extends in-person deliberation with scalable digital methods that address the complexities of modern decision-making in participatory processes.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "In an era where democratic decision-making faces increasing complexity, computational tools have emerged as essential enablers of fair and scalable processes. Modern challenges in democracy often involve balancing individual preferences with collective decisions [36], particularly in large-scale contexts. As Hendriks and Michels [17] point out, each democratic format offers unique strengths and limitations. Deliberative designs are effective in building meaningful discussions, but often engage a limited number of participants and struggle to achieve large-scale impact [28]. Conversely, plebiscitary designs, or voting, can involve broad citizen participation and produce decisive collective outcomes, but often lack the depth of deliberative dialogue. To address these trade-offs, hybrid democratic innovations have emerged, combining the strengths of both approaches [12, 18].\nDeliberative democracy has long focused on the role of informed discussions in determining collective decisions [6]. Recent studies, however, emphasise a complementary dynamic: voting can enhance deliberation [22, 23]. Namely, voting complements and enhances deliberation in seven key ways, as pointed out by Chambers and Warren [7]: it (i) provides a feasible and fair closure mechanism; (ii) ensures equal recognition and status among participants; (iii) politicises deliberation by internalising conflict; (iv) induces authenticity by encouraging participants to reveal their preferences; (v) preserves dissent; (vi) defines issues to focus deliberation effectively; and, (vii) in public voting contexts, fosters accountability for claims. Understanding these dynamics helps identify designs that better integrate deliberation and voting to capitalise on their combined strengths."}, {"title": "1.1 Case Studies", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1.1 Kultur Komitee: Democratising Art and Culture through Participatory Budgeting in Winterthur, Switzerland.", "content": "Established in 2019, the Kultur Komitee [\"Culture Committee\"] in Winterthur, Switzerland, empowers citizens to allocate cultural funding and shape the city's cultural landscape. Combining elements of participatory budgeting and citizens' assemblies, this new Budget Assembly integrates face-to-face deliberations with the tangible outcomes of participatory decision-making.\nThe 2023/2024 cycle (KK24) marked the fourth iteration of the Kultur Komitee process, involving 37 randomly selected citizens. Invitations were distributed via the city's postal service to ensure diverse participation, with 300 invitations sent and 37 accepted. The process began with a kick-off event in September 2023 where committee members developed shared goals and evaluation criteria. An open call for proposals followed, resulting in 134 submissions, which were refined into 56 shortlisted projects for deliberation. In March 2024, participants reviewed these projects individually via approval voting on an online platform, ensuring a streamlined deliberation process while capturing individual preferences. Finally, on 13 April 2024, the committee met in Winterthur to finalise funding decisions using the Human-in-the-Loop Method of Equal Shares (MES) combined with in-person deliberations. CHF 381,500 was ultimately awarded to selected projects. This paper focuses on the later stage of the process involving online voting and the final in-person deliberation.\nOut of the 37 participants involved in the process, 35 attended the final deliberative workshop (N = 35), with a mean age of 41.2 years, ranging from 20 to 82. The gender distribution consisted of 13 males and 22 females. Most participants were born in Switzerland, while 8 were from outside Switzerland. By the end of the process, 35 projects were funded, receiving grants ranging from CHF 2,500 to CHF 30,000, totalling CHF 381,500. During the process of Human-in-the-loop MES, it was decided that 50% of the budget would be used for MES calculation, and the other half would be allocated with deliberation. Eventually, 18 projects were selected using MES, and 17 projects through deliberation. KK24 serves as a model for integrating participatory and deliberative practices in resource allocation.

Building on this, Felicetti [12] proposed \u201cdemocratic assemblage,\u201d emphasising adaptive systemic integration of deliberative and participatory processes. This has been illustrated by Gastil and Broghammer [16], who showed how digital platforms and game mechanics can enhance participatory budgeting through motivation and engagement. Practical applications include the three-step model of Itten and Mouter [19] for climate policymaking, which combines mini-publics and maxi-publics to produce widely accepted recommendations, and Hendriks and Michels [17]'s study of Antwerp's Citizens' Budget, showcasing how \"participatory budgeting new-style\" can align deliberation with large-scale voting to uphold democratic values. Referendum processes have similarly benefited, as Witting et al. [37] identify how deliberation mitigates deficits of referenda. Hendriks and Wagenaar [18] propose deliberative referenda to connect citizens' assemblies with direct voting, thereby enhancing public debate and systemic legitimacy.

These tools integrate deliberation with digital methods for visualising, moderating, and summarising discussions. A prominent example is Polis [32], an open-source platform where participants collect and rate statements on given topics. The tool visualises the high-dimensional opinion space and computes consensus statements to foster common ground in the deliberation. Being applied to many larger participatory processes such as vTaiwan and the German \"Aufstehen\" [\"Stand up\"] movement, Polis demonstrates how digital tools can scale deliberation beyond traditional in-person settings. Another successful example of such an online tool is the Stanford Deliberation Platform [13], where automatic moderation ensures fair deliberation of small groups in video calls. This platform has also been used in the \"America in One Room\" deliberation. To summarise discussions, tools like Wikum [39] and Kialo [8] have been developed. These tools offer thread-like discussions with features such as nested argumentation and can be used to challenge reasoning in deliberation. Decision-making platforms such as Decidim [2] facilitate participatory processes for cities, while initiatives like Decide Madrid and vTaiwan exemplify algorithmic empowerment, decentralising power and fostering pluralistic policymaking [34]. This emphasises the possible role of algorithms in enhancing democratic transparency and inclusivity.\nUmbelino et al. [35] introduce ProtoTeams, a gamified approach to forming diverse groups for real-time collaborative discussions, illustrating how team composition and dynamics influence decision-making outcomes. However, scaling deliberation introduces challenges, as many platforms prioritise technical solutions, often overlooking factors like cultural and linguistic diversity, social inequalities, and inclusion across genders and abilities [31]. Addressing these aspects is also essential to ensure digital tools support a broader and more diverse range of participants."}, {"title": "2.3 Computational Social Choice, Voting and Participatory Budgeting", "content": "Computational social choice provides theoretical and practical tools for designing voting systems that address fairness, propor-tionality, and collective decision-making in contexts such as participatory budgeting (PB) [4]. Fairness in this context refers to the equal representation of diverse voter preferences and the proportional allocation of resources or decision-making power, ensuring that no group is disproportionately advantaged or excluded [10]. Recent advancements have emphasised the integration of computational methods with participatory processes. Aziz and Shah [3] provide a comprehensive survey of PB models, highlighting the importance of preference elicitation, voter incentives, and welfare objectives. Furthermore, the subfield of multi-winner voting contributes insights into proportionality and robustness. Brill and Peters [5] proposes robust axioms for proportional representation, ensuring fairness for cohesive voter groups. Faliszewski et al. [11] further demonstrate the utility of proportional rules in PB elections. Peters et al. [30] formalises axioms for proportional representation in PB with additive utilities, proposing rules like the Method of Equal Shares (MES) to achieve fairness and efficiency. The basic idea of the Method of Equal Shares is that each voter is assigned an equal part of the budget. This part of the budget can only be used to fund projects that the voter has voted for. The method goes through all project proposals, beginning with the projects with the highest number of votes. It selects a project if it can be funded using the budget shares of those who voted for the project. The method then divides the cost of a project equally among its supporters. Faliszewski et al. [11] demonstrates how MES achieves fairer outcomes and avoids divisive districts while improving overall utility. Additionally, Yang et al. [38] explore digital PB platforms, identifying design principles that reduce cognitive load while enhancing fairness and legitimacy, where participants favour expressive input formats and fair budget allocations. Building on these contributions, our paper explores how combining deliberation and computational tools for democratic decision-making should be designed to achieve proportional fairness, transparency, and practicality."}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "This study employs a mixed methods approach, combining computational techniques, digital tools, and participatory frameworks to explore the integration of voting and deliberation.

This tendency for deliberation to gravitate towards consensus solutions has been noted in the literature, with scholars arguing that structured approaches are needed to ensure the representation of marginalised or niche perspectives [1, 20, 33]. Fraser [15] highlights the importance of creating spaces for marginalised groups to deliberate autonomously, while Mansbridge [26] emphasises the role of \"enclaves of protected discourse\u201d to empower these groups in broader discussions. Sunstein [33] introduces the term \"Enclave Deliberation,\u201d noting both its potential to address inequalities and the risks of group polarisation, which can be mitigated through careful integration into wider deliberative processes.\nRadial Clustering for Preference Based Subgroups, hereby referred to as just \"Radial Clustering\", builds on the concept of Enclave Deliberation by structuring initial discussions in homogeneous groups. In these groups, participants with similar voting patterns deliberate to ensure niche interests are well-represented and given a platform. This stage creates an environment where marginalised perspectives can emerge without being overshadowed by dominant views. In the second round, participants transition to heterogeneous groups to engage with diverse perspectives, building broader understanding and identifying projects that benefit larger segments of citizens. By combining enclave-inspired homogeneous groups with broader heterogeneous deliberation, Radial Clustering aim to ensure both equality and inclusivity in the decision-making process.\nStandard clustering methods, such as k-Means [24], often create uneven groups or exclude outliers. While extensions exist that adjust the loss function to balance cluster sizes [25], these complex algorithms might not be very comprehensive for participants in the deliberation. Our suggestion, Radial clustering, ensures equal group sizes with a straightforward and visually understandable algorithm: It projects the participants to a two-dimensional opinion space and divides it radially into \"pizza slices\".

The steps for group assignment and deliberation were as follows:\n(1) Dimensionality Reduction and Mapping: The group composition was based on participants' voting similarity in a pre-survey (i.e., approval votes for 50+ projects). These high-dimensional data were reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), projecting participants' preferences into a two-dimensional space. Each participant's angular position in this space was calculated relative to the mean position:\n$\\theta = arctan(\\frac{PC2_i - mean(PC2)}{PC1_i - mean(PC1)})$, where $PC1_i$ and $PC2_i$ represent the coordinates of participant $i$. The angles $\\theta$ were normalised to 0-360 degrees.\n(2) Radial Partitioning and Group Assignment: The angular space [0, 360\u00b0] was divided into six sectors, each having 6-7 participants. To achieve this, each sector was initialised spanning $\\frac{360}{6}$ degrees. Participants were assigned to sectors based on their angular positions. The angles of each sector were then iteratively adjusted to arrive at balanced group sizes.\n(3) Two-Round Deliberation with Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Groups: The Radial clustering method was used to assign participants to six homogeneous groups (A/B/C/D/E/F) in the first round. In the second round, participants were reassigned to six heterogeneous groups (1/2/3/4/5/6), ensuring diversity by mixing members from different homogeneous groups.\nIn both rounds, group members discussed, selected, and ranked five projects. Rankings were converted into Borda scores (e.g., 1st: 5 points, 2nd: 4 points, etc.), and the points from all groups were aggregated across both rounds. Projects were then selected based on total points until the budget was fully allocated."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Evaluation Metric.", "content": "To evaluate the alignment between individual votes and group decisions, we calculate a weighted, normalised alignment score ($\\mathcal{A}_i$) for each voter in both homogeneous and heterogeneous rounds.

While simple and efficient, it favours majority preferences and overlooks minority groups. The Method of Equal Shares (MES), proposed by Peters et al.

Here, $u_i(p)$ denotes the utility voter $i$ derives from project $p$, representing the perceived benefit or preference for the project.

A project is $q$-affordable when its total cost $c_p$ can be funded by voters, each contributing no more than $q$ monetary units per unit of utility. If no project is affordable, the process ends, returning the set of winners $W$.\n(2) Select and Deduct: Add the most affordable project $p$ to the set of winners $W$, and update each voter's budget:\nThis ensures that voters contribute only as much as their remaining budget allows, with contributions capped by their proportional share based on $q u_i(p)$."}, {"title": "3.2.3 The Human-in-the-Loop extension.", "content": "The starting budget begins at $B/n$, where $B$ is the total budget and $n$ is the number of voters.

This ensures that groups with shared preferences are fairly represented in the selected set of projects.\nThe Human-in-the-Loop MES process begins by aggregating votes using the MES algorithm applied to a partial budget. An interactive interface enables participants to adjust a slider controlling the total budget allocation from 0 to 380,000 CHF. This feature provides real-time visualisation of the projects that would be funded under different budget scenarios using MES calculations. After exploring the outcomes, participants collaboratively decide on a specific budget allocation for the MES calculation. In this study, 190,000 CHF - 50% of the total budget - was allocated to the MES calculation, resulting in 18 projects being funded.\nFollowing the initial selection of projects based on the MES algorithm, participants engage in a deliberation round. During this round, they discuss whether the budget of any selected projects should be adjusted or whether any projects from the MES set should be eliminated.

We also observed more groups using sticky notes as votes to make collective decisions in the heterogeneous round, as shown in Figure 6. This pattern is further illustrated in Appendix Table 1. Among the 17 projects selected during the deliberation process, 7 overlap with those that would have been chosen if online voting alone determined the funding allocation for this portion of the budget. Compared to a hypothetical pure voting scenario, heterogeneous deliberation introduces fewer unique projects. Only 3 projects were selected primarily due to heterogeneous deliberation (tagged HT), while 7 projects were selected primarily due to homogeneous deliberation (tagged HM). This suggests that homogeneous deliberation incorporates a wider range of projects that diverge from individual voting outcomes.\nOne possible explanation is that participants with diverse preferences in heterogeneous groups find it challenging to reach consensus, often resorting to in-group voting to resolve differences.

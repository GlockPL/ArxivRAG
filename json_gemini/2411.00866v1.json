This dataset provides imaging data in DICOM format along with detailed clinical information, including patient-\nreported pain scores, diagnostic codes, and procedural codes, which are not commonly available in similar datasets. The MRKR dataset also features imaging metadata such as image laterality, view type, and presence of hardware, enhancing its value for research and model development. MRKR addresses significant gaps in existing datasets by offering a more representative sample for studying osteoarthritis and related outcomes, particularly among minority populations, thereby providing a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Millions of Americans suffer from knee pain, with the predominant cause being osteoarthritis, leading to decreased mobility and quality of life 1,2,3. Previous research has shown that estimating patient pain based on knee radiographs is suboptimal, particularly for minority patients 4,5. Deep learning models can be trained to use knee radiographs to grade osteoarthritis severity and predict pain scores for patients, helping clinicians and researchers gain deeper insights into osteoarthritis 6,7,8,9,10,11. However, there are limited publicly available datasets for knee radiographs, and none are both demographically diverse and include patient outcomes and pain scores. This can lead to poor generalizability of models trained using these data, particularly for minority patients. 12,13,14.\nWhile several robust longitudinal knee radiograph datasets exist, they are generally small for deep learning model development, and none include patient CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) and ICD (International Classification of Diseases) codes. For example, the Osteoarthritis Initiative an extensive multicenter dataset of biomarkers, survey responses, and knee radiographs of 4,796 patients over nine years15. Similarly, the Multicenter\nOur Emory Musculoskeletal Knee Radiograph Dataset\n(MRKR) contains 503,261 knee radiographs of 83,011\npatients, 33,503 (40.4%) of whom are African American.\nThe dataset includes patient pain scores, ICD codes, and\nCPT codes for knee-related procedures and outcomes.\nEach image is also curated image laterality, view type,\nKellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis severity grading score\n(KLG) 19,20, and hardware annotations. This makes MRKR\namongst the largest and most demographically diverse\ndataset of its kind."}, {"title": "Material and Methods", "content": "The Institutional Review Board approved the development of this retrospective dataset, comprising knee radiographs and clinical data.

This included outpatient, inpatient, emergency department, and pre and post-surgical radiographs, including those obtained by orthopedic surgeons, which were not interpreted by radiologists."}, {"title": "Imaging data", "content": "Exams were extracted from the institution's Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) in DICOM format using Niffler21, an open-source pipeline developed in-house for retrospective image extraction that utilizes pydicom22.\nDICOM metadata was de-identified using an internal pipeline to maintain relationships and temporality between exams from the same patient and accompanying clinical data. A pixel de-identification tool from MD.ai\n(www.md.ai) was used to remove any pixel data, such as names, dates, or times, from the DICOM images. DICOMs that included non-radiographic modalities or secondary captures were dropped."}, {"title": "Clinical Coding Data", "content": "ICD and CPT codes were extracted from the Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW), which regularly receives information"}, {"title": "Patient-reported pain data", "content": "Pain scores and associated dates were extracted from the CDW. Pain data is recorded as an integer score from 0 to\n10 with a free-text location of pain. Parsing free-text to\ncategorize pain location was challenging as the location\ncould be mentioned as an extremity (i.e. left lower\nextremity), a joint (i.e. knee), or more vaguely (i.e. leg).\nFirst, a series of regular expression rules were used to filter definitive knee-related pain scores in the dataset. In cases where the pain location was indicated as \"lower extremity\" or other vague description, the pain location value was assigned \"other\" due to ambiguity."}, {"title": "Demographic data", "content": "Patient self-reported race, gender, and ethnicity are extracted at the patient level. Patient age at the time of exam is abstracted using de-identified data of birth information. Race categories for patients consist of White, Black, Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian Other Pacific Islander, or multiple. A small fraction, less than one percent, were identified as multiple races. For ethnicity, responses were distilled into three groups:\nHispanic, non-Hispanic, and unknown/unreported. This categorization is based the varying syntax of responses."}, {"title": "Data Curation", "content": "We discovered several inconsistencies in the original imaging data, including exam descriptions for knee radiographs that contained other erroneous anatomic regions such as chest or hand radiographs, or did not include the entire knee joint. We trained a ConvNeXt model to exclude non-knee images by labeling 8,362 knee and non-knee images using the MD.ai annotation platform. Overall accuracy for detecting non-knee radiographs was 0.999, with an F1-score of 0.961 with a\n5% prevalence. Using this model, we discovered 675 non- knee radiographs which were excluded from the dataset.\nWe found DICOM metadata unreliable for categorizing image laterality and view type in radiographs, often mislabeling unilateral as bilateral images and vice versa, and frequently missing or inaccurately noting view positions like frontal, lateral, oblique, and sunrise. There was no reliable metadata for weight bearing studies or presence arthroplasty (total, hemi, or unicompartmental). To address this, we manually labeled 6,000 radiographs for these details using MD.ai and trained a multi-class ConvNext classifier. The model achieved high weighted average F1-scores across categories: 0.985 for laterality, 0.974 for view position, 0.981 for weight bearing, and 0.992 for arthroplasty. When images lacked a laterality marker (n=2647), we used the\nDICOM metadata for image laterality."}, {"title": "Resulting Dataset", "content": "Patient information is summarized in Table 1.

Introduction", "content": "The assessment of tool wear is crucial in manufacturing\nsystems as it enables timely decisions for tool replacement,\nensures workpiece quality, and enhances productivity while\nyielding cost savings. In recent years, advances in computer,\nsensor, and signal processing technologies have facilitated real-\ntime monitoring of machining process signals, promoting the\ndevelopment of data-driven approaches for tool wear\nestimation [1,2]. The primary concept behind data-driven\nmethods involves training a tool wear model using historical\ndata, which is then utilized to estimate tool wear by inputting\nonline-collected data into the trained model."}, {"title": "1.1. Tool wear estimation with machine learning", "content": "In initial research, a variety of traditional machine learning\nalgorithms were employed for estimating tool wear, such as\nrandom forest (RF) [3,4], support vector machine (SVM) [5,6],\ngaussian process regression (GPR) [7,8], artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) [9,10], fuzzy neural network (FNN) [11], and\nothers. These methods generally necessitate manual feature\nextraction and selection, which becomes unfeasible with the\ngrowing amount of monitoring data, resulting in decreased\nestimation accuracy. The significant progress in computational\npower has enabled the use of deep learning algorithms for tool\nwear estimation due to their inherent ability to learn feature\nrepresentations [12,13]. The representing deep learning\nalgorithm, convolutional neural network (CNN) [14] is widely\nemployed for processing not only image data but also\nsequential data [15,16,17]. CNN exhibits weight sharing, local\nconnectivity translational invariance, and spatial invariance\nproperties, by stacking convolutional and pooling layers. As a\nresult, it is frequently employed to extract one-dimensional or\ntwo-dimensional spatial features from force or vibration\nsignal sequences. Mart\u00ednez-Arellano et al. [18] present a new\nbig data approach for tool wear classification using CNN with\nsignal imaging, and achieve a classification accuracy of tool\ncondition above 90%. Huang et al. [19] introduce a multi-scale\nconvolutional neural network featuring an attention fusion\nmodule for tool wear classification, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. These\nmodels demonstrate powerful spatial and temporal feature\nextraction abilities."}, {"title": "1.2. Transferring the tool wear estimation model", "content": "During practical applications, cutting conditions change due\nto alterations in the workpiece, cutting tool, or cutting\nparameters. Such changes result in significant variations in\nmonitoring data distributions. The network obtained above is\ndesigned for a single cutting condition, and collecting sufficient\ndata samples for each condition to train a deep learning model\nentails considerable time, experimentation, and labor costs.\nConsequently, the aforementioned method faces challenges in\nprecisely estimating tool wear under varying cutting\nconditions. Li et al. [20] utilize the entropy weight method and\ngray correlation analysis to identify signal features exhibiting\nstrong relationships with tool wear and weak relationships with\ncutting conditions. This strategy minimizes the influence of\ncutting conditions on both monitoring signals and tool wear,\nenabling the model to adapt to other parameter variations and\npreserve estimation accuracy. Nonetheless, the feature\nengineering involved in this approach becomes unfeasible\nwhen confronted with high-frequency, large-volume industrial\ndata. The re-selection of features and manual examination\nunder varying cutting conditions are still inevitable, and there\nis potential information loss in comparison to deep learning\nmethods based on raw data.\nThis study aims to introduce a deep learning approach that\nconsiders cutting conditions, which could substantially\nenhance the estimation of actual tool wear under diverse cutting\nconditions compared to previous methods. To assess the\nmodel's accuracy and transferability, milling experiments were\nconducted under various cutting parameters. The subsequent\nchapter outlines the model's structure. Chapter 3 details the\nexperimental setup, data processing flow, and validation\nstrategy employed to evaluate the model. Chapter 4 offers an\nanalysis and discussion of the validation results. The final\nchapter concludes by summarizing the proposed approach's\ncharacteristics and providing a perspective on its future\nadvancements."}, {"title": "2. Incorporating Cutting Conditions in Model", "content": "The objective of this study is to ascertain the enhanced\ntransferability of the proposed deep learning method in\ncontrast to approaches that disregard the cutting condition,\nthereby emphasizing the model's comparative performance\nsuperiority. The scope of this paper does not encompass further\noptimization strategies, such as the employment of more\nsophisticated residual networks or the integration of recurrent\nneural networks, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\narchitectures. The overarching concept of the proposed deep\nlearning method is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe model consists of a CNN designed to estimate tool wear\nunder specific cutting conditions. A typical CNN architecture\ncomprises multiple distinct kernel filters that effectively and\nautonomously extract highly discriminative features from the\ninput data, encompassing both the time domain of individual\ntime series signals and the cross-series domain. The\nfundamental structure of CNN primarily includes an input\nlayer, convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected\nlayers, and an output layer. In the input layer, each time series\nsignal from the sensor serves as a signal channel, with each\ncutting condition incorporated as an additional separate\nchannel. Consequently, the data at each time point comprises\nthe current value of each time series signal as well as the\nprevailing cutting condition such as feed per tooth, cutting\ndepth, etc. The initial convolutional layer emphasizes\ncorrelation and fusion among the disparate time series signals,\naccompanied by minimal compression in the time domain.\nSubsequent convolutional layers concentrate on the time\ndomain. The output layer is configured with multiple outputs,\naiming for multi-scale tool wear measurements to enhance\nmodel performance and robustness. The specific input signals\nand tool wear measurements are delineated in Chapter 3. The\ntraining configurations for all models are consistent across both\nthe test and reference models. The model employs a learning\nrate decay strategy, incorporating an initial learning rate of\n0.001, a decay rate of 0.7, and a step decay approach with decay\napplied every 20 epochs. Utilizing the Adam optimization\nalgorithm, each model undergoes training for a total of 100\nepochs."}, {"title": "3. Experimental Setup for Model Validation", "content": "The subsequent sections elucidate the experimental setup,\nencompassing the tools, materials, and sensors employed, in\naddition to the data processing and model validation\nmethodologies implemented."}, {"title": "3.1. Experimental setup", "content": "In order to train the proposed method and validate its\ntransferability, 13 groups of milling experiments were designed\nwith different process parameters and conducted utilizing a\n5-axis machining center DMU 85 Monoblock from DMG\nMori. Fig. 2 shows the experimental setup. An Inconel 718 DA\nring-shaped workpiece was fixed on the stationary\ndynamometer, with a height of 3 cm, an outer diameter of\n30 cm, and an inner diameter of 8 cm. Uncoated end mills were\nemployed, featuring four cutting edges, a diameter of 6 mm,\nand a corner radius of 0.15 mm. The cutting edges remained\nunrounded and tool substrate is HM-MG10. Throughout the\nexperiments, the milling process was executed\ncircumferentially on the workpiece, with pre-determined\ncutting parameters. The duration of each cut, ranging from 10\nto 20 seconds, was contingent upon specific cutting parameters\nand the progression of tool wear during the examination.\nFollowing each cut, the tool wear was assessed with a Keyence\nVHX 900F microscope. When the maximum width of flank\nwear land $VB_{max}$ reached 200 \u00b5m on any of the four cutting\nedges, the tool was deemed entirely worn and subsequently not\nused further. Parameters monitored during the cutting process\nincluded cutting force components, spindle torque, and selected\ninternal machine signals. A Kistler 9255C stationary\ndynamometer (SD) was employed to measure the workpiece-\nside cutting force components. Meanwhile, a Kistler 9170A\nrotating cutting dynamometer (RCD) was utilized to measure\nspindle torque and tool-side cutting force components.\nAdditionally, auxiliary drive positions were documented and\nsynchronized with the stationary dynamometer and RCD\nreadings.\nRegarding the process parameters, all experiments will be\nconducted at a consistent cutting speed $v_c$ of 25 m/min, a\ncutting depth $a_p$ of 2.5 mm, and a cutting width $a_e$ of 1.5 mm.\nThe variability in parameters stems from the feed per\ntooth $f_z$ (FPT), which ranges between 0.015 mm and\n0.060 mm."}, {"title": "3.2. Data preparation", "content": "To model tool wear using the data-driven approach, the data\ncollected during the tests must first be processed. This includes\ndata preprocessing and labeling. Fig. 3 shows the procedure for\ndata pre-processing. A single cutting operation comprises three\ndistinct phases: cut entry, milling, and cut exit, with the milling\nprocess characterized by consistent cutting conditions. The\ninitial step involves isolating the signal segments\ncorresponding to the milling process based on the auxiliary\ndrive position. Each signal segment encompasses five signal\nchannels: the spindle torque ($M_{spindle}$), two orthogonal cutting\nforce components from the RCD ($F_{RCD_x}$ and $F_{RCD_y}$) and two\northogonal cutting force components ($F_{SD_x}$ and $F_{SD_y}$) from\nthe stationary dynamometer. The orthogonal cutting force\ncomponents $F_{SD_x}$ and $F_{SD_y}$ are transformed, utilizing the\nauxiliary drive position, into a cutting force aligned with the\nfeed direction ($F_{SD_{feed}}$) and a cutting force perpendicular to\nthe feed direction ($F_{SD_{normal}}$). This conversion facilitates the\nrepresentation of circular motion as linear motion, enabling the\ncomparison of signals at varying positions. The resultant\nforces, $F_{RCD_{resultant}}$ and $F_{SD_{resultant}}$, can be calculated from\n$F_{RCD_x}$ and $F_{RCD_y}$ or $F_{SD_{feed}}$ and $F_{SD_{normal}}$, respectively.\nConsequently, seven sensor signal series can be obtained from\na single cutting operation, providing comprehensive data for\nanalysis and optimization of the milling process. Subsequently,\nthe final one-second interval of the seven-channel raw sensor\ndata is extracted as the representative signal for each cut, due\nto its proximity to the tool wear measurement. Upon\nconducting a frequency analysis of all signals, the highest\nfrequency is found to be approximately 4000 Hz.\nConsequently, a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of\n8000 Hz is employed to reduce noise within the signals. Given\nthat the sampling time is 50 \u00b5s, this one-second duration\ncomprises 20,000 time steps. Correspondingly, with seven\nsensor signals, this amounts to a total of 140,000 data points.\nThe width of flank wear land is used as the output of the\nmodel. To generate the label, the cutting edge was divided into\nfour sections along its length. The first section extended from\n1000 to 1300 \u00b5m from the edge's end, the second from 700 to\n1000 \u00b5m, the third from 400 to 700 \u00b5m, and the last from 100\nto 400 \u00b5m. For each section, the average and maximum width\nof flank wear land (e.g. $VB_1$ and $VB_{max\\_1}$) were determined.\nIn addition, for each cutting edge, the overall average and\nmaximum width of flank wear land (e.g. $VB_{E1}$ and $VB_{max\\_E1}$)\nwere calculated, resulting in 10 values per cutting edge. Fig. 4\npresents an illustration of 10 measurement results for one of the\ncutting edges. By averaging the 40 widths of flank wear land\nfrom the four cutting edges of a single tool by cutting edge, a\nfinal set of ten widths of flank wear land was obtained. The\nrationale behind this procedure is to augment the learning\nreference target of the model, thereby enhancing its overall\nperformance."}, {"title": "3.3.

It\nis noteworthy that the model's performance is inferior on data\nwith an FPT of 0.0150 mm (or 0.0600 mm) compared to data\nwith an FPT of 0.0300 mm (or 0.0525 mm). This suggests that\nthe greater the discrepancy in FPT between the training and test\ndatasets, the poorer the model performance. However, for data\nwith large differences in FPT, the test model maintains a 24.6%\nadvantage on RMSE before partial learning and an 18.4%\nadvantage after partial learning compared to the reference\nmodel. This implies that the test model can still provide more\naccurate tool wear estimates on data with considerable\nvariation in FPT."}, {"title": "5.

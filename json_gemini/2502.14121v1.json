{"title": "Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Networked Black-Box Systems: A Path to Greener Profits and Smarter Designs", "authors": ["Akshay Kudva", "Wei-Ting Tang", "Joel A. Paulson"], "abstract": "Designing modern industrial systems requires balancing several competing objectives, such as profitability, resilience, and sustainability, while accounting for complex interactions between techno-logical, economic, and environmental factors. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are com-monly used to navigate these tradeoffs, but selecting the appropriate algorithm (or solver) to tackle these problems is often unclear, particularly when system representations vary from fully equation-based (white-box) to entirely data-driven (black-box) models. While grey-box MOO methods attempt to bridge this gap, they typically impose rigid assumptions on system structure, requiring models to conform to the underlying structural assumptions of the solver rather than the solver adapting to the natural representation of the system of interest. In this chapter, we introduce a unifying approach to grey-box MOO by leveraging network (or graph) representations, which provide a general and flexible framework for modeling interconnected systems as a series of function nodes that share various inputs and outputs. Specifically, we propose MOBONS, a novel Bayesian optimization-inspired algorithm that can efficiently optimize general function networks, including those with cyclic dependencies, en-abling the modeling of feedback loops, recycle streams, and multi-scale simulations - features that existing methods fail to capture. Furthermore, MOBONS incorporates constraints, supports parallel evaluations to accelerate convergence, and preserves the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization while leveraging network structure for improved scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOBONS through two case studies, including one related to sustainable process design. By enabling efficient MOO under general graph representations, MOBONS has the potential to significantly en-hance the design of more profitable, resilient, and sustainable engineering systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Over the last two centuries, industrial innovation has prioritized efficiency, scale, and profitability, often overlooking the long-term environmental consequences of mass production and resource extraction [1, 2]. Early advances in petrochemical refining and chemical manufacturing focused on maximizing throughput and profit margins, with little consideration for pollutant emissions and hazardous waste. As environ-mental concerns became more pressing, government policies \u2013 such as the Air Pollution Control Act (1955) and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (1970) [3] \u2013 led to stricter regula-tions, prompting process systems engineering (PSE) practitioners to integrate environmental and safety constraints into their design objectives. By the 1970s, nonlinear programming (NLP) methods were being used to optimize capital cost objectives under uncertainty [4, 5], followed by advances in feasibility and flexibility analysis [6, 7, 8, 9] and later integrated design and control (IDC) frameworks [10, 11, 12]. These developments laid the foundation for more holistic optimization approaches that simultaneously consider economic, operational, and regulatory factors."}, {"title": "2 Problem Formulation", "content": "In this chapter, we consider the problem of multi-objective optimization in the presence of expensive function evaluations.

Unlike most existing approaches that rely either on fully equation-oriented (white-box) representations or treat the entire problem as a monolithic black-box, our method leverages a network (graph) structure to capture key interactions and information flows between subsystem functions. While MOBONS builds on prior work that uses function networks in Bayesian optimization, it provides two primary advances: to our knowledge, it is the first algorithm to address both multi-objective problems and function networks simultaneously, and it is also the first to accommodate cyclic graphs (e.g., recycle"}]}

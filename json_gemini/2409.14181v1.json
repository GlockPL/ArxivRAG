Consequently, several open challenges exist in\npredicting epidemic outbreaks, detecting variants, tracing contacts, discovering new\ndrugs, and fighting misinformation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide tools to deal\nwith these scenarios, demonstrating promising results in the fight against the COVID-\n19 pandemic. Al is becoming increasingly integrated into various aspects of society.\nHowever, ensuring that Al benefits are distributed equitably and that they are used\nresponsibly is crucial. Multiple countries are creating regulations to address these\nconcerns, but the borderless nature of Al requires global cooperation to define\nregulatory and guideline consensus. Considering this, The Global South Al for\nPandemic & Epidemic Preparedness & Response Network (AI4PEP) has developed\nan initiative comprising 16 projects across 16 countries in the Global South, seeking\nto strengthen equitable and responsive public health systems that leverage Southern-\nled responsible Al solutions to improve prevention, preparedness, and response to\nemerging and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This opinion introduces our\nbranches in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries and discusses Al\ngovernance in LAC in the light of biotechnology. Our network in LAC has high potential\nto help fight infectious diseases, particularly in low- and middle-income countries,\ngenerating opportunities for the widespread use of Al techniques to improve the health\nand well-being of their communities.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction and Problem Statement", "content": "Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak highlight the need to\nimprove our preparedness for similar events [1]. This pandemic has shown us that no\nsingle person, community, or country is isolated and that suffering and lack of support\naffecting single individuals, independent of where they are, affect all of us. Moreover,\nwe must recognise talent, wherever and whoever they are, to join and collaborate in\nthe search for solutions to the world's challenges.\nIn this effort, Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a valuable tool to reduce\npandemic impacts [2]. In an era where Al is present in various processes that impact\nsociety, it is essential to ensure that its contributions are distributed equitably [3].\nMoreover, the democratisation of Al must empower each individual, community, or\nsociety to contribute proportionately to their aptitude, availability, dedication, and\nspeed [4].\nWith Al's advances, concerns, and contributions, the world has received\npositive and negative signals regarding the future of a world where Al is firmly present\n[5]. Advances in all knowledge domains show how Al can not only accelerate scientific\ndiscoveries and the design of innovative solutions, many of them improving people's\nhealth, but also be one of the most valuable tools for improving the quality of life on\nearth [6]. On the other hand, recent articles, talks, and interviews address the dangers\nof developing and using Al [5, 7, 8].\nLaw-making bodies in many countries and regions are passing new regulations\nregarding the development and use of Al to reduce or avoid risks associated with this\ntechnology [9, 10]. These regulations may prevent biased Al systems, ensure fairness,\nand improve privacy protection. Nevertheless, Al has no borders. If one country is rigid\nand another is permissive on the same issue, harmful efforts will be directed to the\nmore permissive country. Recent articles have defended the idea that Al regulation\nshould not be the responsibility or work of a single country or region. Therefore, a\nglobal board should indicate the best actions to create legislation regulating Al, similar\nto the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an intergovernmental body\nof the United Nations [11, 12].\nThe democratisation of Al aims at its ethical and responsible expansion, which\ninvolves its development, use, and control [4, 13]. These aims require equal\nopportunities across the world. Furthermore, we should lay plans to share knowledge\nand training involving Al to benefit all regions of the globe [13].\nConsidering these issues, York University (Toronto, Canada) was selected in a\nCanadian national bid for a grant from the International Development Research Centre\n(IDRC) (Al and Global Health Investment\u00b9) to support countries in the global south to\nfight infectious diseases using Al, The Global South Al for Pandemic & Epidemic\nPreparedness & Response Network (AI4PEP2). This network comprises 16 projects\nfrom 16 countries in the global south. This paper introduces our branches in Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean (LAC) countries and discusses Al governance in LAC."}, {"title": "2. Challenges and Inequalities in LAC", "content": "Al solutions have been proposed in several domains (e.g., healthcare, finances,\neducation, agriculture). In October 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nreported 521 Al and ML-enabled medical devices [14]. Furthermore, the COVID-19\npandemic demonstrated the potential of ML techniques to minimise the effects of a\npandemic, such as the prediction of deaths, contact tracing, diagnosis, treatments,\nand others [15, 16].\nNevertheless, many studies have a black-box nature (i.e., Al decisions are not\nunderstandable on a human level) [17, 18], which may reduce Al's trust, accountability,\nand acceptance [19]. Another concern is that ML models can follow hidden social\nbiases in the data, leading to unfair, harmful, or prejudiced decisions. Some examples\nof these problems were recently reported. In 2009, genome-wide association studies\nhad more than 96% of participants of European descent [20], failing to encompass\nracial and geographic diversity. Cirillo and collaborators [21] reported sex and gender\ndifferences and biases in Al for biomedicine and healthcare. In dermatology, medical\nimaging, and diabetes management, studies have discussed the lack of racial diversity\nin ML algorithms, with possible risks of health disparities [22, 23, 39].\nConsequently, initiatives have discussed concerns regarding ethical, fair,\nreliable, sustainable, transparent, and reproducible Al [24]. Thus, in search of\nresponsible solutions, our network follows guidelines proposed in the literature, such\nas how to develop and use Al responsibly [25], Al for all [26], Guidelines for\nTrustworthy Al [27], Ethics of AI (UNESCO), and others. We also adopt and\nrecommend the principles of Data-Centric Al [28], putting data at the heart of an Al\nsystem development process, and the guidelines to improve the Findability,\nAccessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of data known as FAIR data principles [29]."}, {"title": "3. Comparative Al Governance Models in LAC", "content": "According to a report by the OECD5, in 2022 [30], Al capacities in LAC countries\nvary widely. Countries like Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, and Bolivia have yet to\nachieve significant public sector development. Uruguay and Colombia are regional\nleaders in Al strategy research and development. These countries are followed by\nPeru, Chile, Brazil, Costa Rica, and Argentina, which have drafted or enacted\nlegislation about Al. In addition, Mexico was the first LAC nation to create a national\nstrategy for Al, as shown in Table 1. Lastly, Paraguay, Panama, Jamaica, Ecuador,\nthe Dominican Republic, and Barbados are beginning to integrate public sector\nstrategies for Al.\nAccording to the same OECD Report, Annex A (2022) [30], some critical points\nregarding LAC nations' Al strategies include:\n\u2022\nUruguay (Al Strategy for the Digital Government) focused on Al use for\ngovernmental administration, capacity building, responsible use, and digital\ncitizenship.\n\u2022\nPeru (National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence) infrastructure, ethics, training,\nand economic models, among other strategies to incorporate Al in\ngovernmental operations. Renews strategy every two years after 2026.\n\u2022 Mexico (IA-MX 2018) has an Al subcommittee that looks towards the best\npossible government and combined approaches. They have participated in\ntechnology-related working groups.\n\u2022\nColombia (Digital Transformation and Al National Policy) also searches to\ninclude Al in government and governmental services.\n\u2022\nChile (Al Action Plan and Al National Policy) looks for Al inclusion in sustainable\ndevelopment and other areas of well-being, as well as regulatory aspects.\n\u2022\nBrazil (Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy) looks for Al use in government\nthrough regulation, use in public services, legislation, ethics, setting norms for\nuse, and even international aspects.\n\u2022 Argentina (Al National Plan) uses Al to address the needs of government and\ncitizens and more efficient work at the State level.\n\u2022\nUruguay (Agenda Uruguay Digital 2020) looks for responsible, equitable, and\nrespectful Al strategies in the country, as well as the privacy of users [31, 32].\n\u2022 Costa Rica lawmakers created an Al regulation bill draft using ChatGPT, a\npublicly available Al tool that became popular during the Winter of 2022. It was\ncreated to call for legislation regarding Al use and development [34].\n\u2022 The Dominican Republic has a national posture about Al but has yet to create\na route to enforce it.\nThe OECD report provides valuable guidance for LAC governments on maximising\nAl's positive impacts and minimising the negative ones. By following these\nrecommendations, governments can help to ensure that Al is used for the benefit of\nall."}, {"title": "4. Democratizing Al Knowledge in LAC", "content": "The interest in Al has influenced several areas and, in many cases, directly\nimpacting people's lives, such as healthcare. However, scaling invocations requires\nadaptation and acceptance, which is often challenging. Therefore, understanding\nwhich factors influence the adoption of new ideas plays an important role. Considering\nthis, our network proposes to use Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory [37], which\naims to explain how new ideas or innovations can be adopted, such as (1) relative\nadvantage, (2) compatibility, (3) complexity, (4) experimentability and (5) observability.\nWe will also apply other measures for innovation adoption [38] (e.g., cost-efficacy,\nfeasibility, perceived evidence, innovation fit with users' norms, relevance, and ease).\nTo democratise Al knowledge, we intend to maximise the dissemination of\nresults and products among the target communities where our motivating issues arise,\nas well as the training of human resources. We know that to bring positive societal\nchanges, we must educate young academics, health professionals, policymakers,\njournalists, and invested citizens. Therefore, our network proposes several\napproaches, such as (see Figure 1): (1) Engagement with underrepresented\ncommunities; (2) Special short courses; (3) Public awareness campaigns in Al; (4)\nCollaboration with Industry; (5) International collaboration; (6) Open-Source Initiatives;\nand (7) Community-based development."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "As we face global challenges such as pandemics, Al emerges as a capable ally\nto mitigate the impact of these crises and diminish response time in real-time,\npromoting a more resilient world. However, the journey to harness Al's potential is\nfraught with ethical challenges. The democratisation of Al knowledge and tools in LAC,\nas proposed by our network, represents a fundamental step towards making Al\naccessible to a broader set of stakeholders, covering healthcare professionals,\npolicymakers, and the general population. Therefore, this democratisation is a\nmultifaceted effort that requires cooperation, innovation, and a firm commitment to\nethical principles not only in Latin America and Caribbean countries but worldwide. By\npromoting international collaboration, disseminating knowledge, and adopting\nresponsible Al practices, we can harness the transformative power of Al to build a\nmore resilient and equitable world, prepared to face future challenges, whether\npandemics or not. The LAC region plays a distinct role in this effort, contributing to the\nglobal discourse on Al governance and its conscious use in the service of humanity."}]}

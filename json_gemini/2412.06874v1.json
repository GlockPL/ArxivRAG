Searching, selecting, and booking travel services such as flights and hotels along with car rentals and vacation packages are all possible using these systems [1]. The platforms are developed as the backbone for online travel agencies (OTAs), airlines, hotel chains, or other travel providers for seamless customer platforms to plan and purchase their journeys [2]. These simple, user-friendly systems are gradually becoming more complex as they are adapting with the needs of the developing industry: real-time data and several service providers along with their own unique preferences end customers have been accounted for in this personalized construction [16].\nSuch systems are not only used for reservation activities convenience. They instead give platforms for revenues to be generated for businesses, determine customer satisfaction, and have an even bigger role in planning travel logistics with visualization of customer journeys end to end.

Apart from that, booking processes can be optimized by AI-based algorithms, like genetic algorithms and neural networks, which are used to formulate the best options available with regard to cost, time, and sustainability.\nA microservices architecture has a lot of advantages to offer in terms of better system scalability and flexibility [5]. Microservices break the traditional monolithic reservation systems into independent smaller services, which are more efficient in using resources, easy to update one independent service, and offer better fault tolerance [6]. This is a travel reservation system built on microservices where different functionalities, such as pricing, booking, and customer feedback, are handled by different services, which can be separately scaled in accordance with demand variation [11]. Such modularity can facilitate faster integration of additional features and services such as an Al-enabled recommendation engine or a sustainability-checking module into the overall system, thus adding to the flexibility of the entire system [7].\nSynergies of both AI and microservices shall surely metamorphose travel reservation systems into more agile, more efficient, and much more effective ways of creating superior customer experiences [8]."}, {"title": "1.2.\nResearch Objectives", "content": "The overall objective of the research will be to optimize travel reservation systems through the application of artificial intelligence (AI), combined with a microservices architecture.

The monolithic approach can also have difficulties when faced with high traffic and real-time processing requirements, which become ubiquitous in modern travel systems [38].\nMicroservices-based architectures, on the other hand, break, in smaller, autonomous services, which can run by themselves and communicate through strict APIs, a system into smaller, independent services [26]. It will be found advantageous for increased scalability since each service can scale independently from the demand [39]. In addition, flexibility and fault tolerance brought about by maintenance are dependent on seamless updating and addition of new capabilities without disturbing the whole system. Real-time customer-centric applications, thus, travel reservations, would suit microservices whose characteristics of agility and responsiveness are of great importance [44]."}, {"title": "AI Applications in Travel Reservation Systems", "content": "Travel reservation systems have benefitted greatly from artificial intelligence.

GAs are capable of searching very successfully among huge, complicated datasets for optimal solutions at the global level and are thus used for itinerary optimization, amongst other things, using cost-effective or time-efficient travel routes. GAs may prove to be more effective in real-time optimization, where a number of constraints (e.g., cost, time, preferences) have to be simultaneously balanced [42].\nThese solutions can work together, and certainly will, to make travel reservation systems smarter and more efficient by enhancing both user engagement and operational performance."}, {"title": "2.2.

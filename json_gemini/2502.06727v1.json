The application of Al in civil Engineering involves combining advanced machine learning techniques to achieve improved construction practice, promoting sustainability in the construction industry, and improving infrastructuraldesign in the built environment. Several machine learning techniques and algorithms,like artificial neural network, deep learning, fuzzy logic, etc., have been applied inestimating different properties such as concrete composites, slope failuresusceptibility, and soil compaction parameters."}, {"title": "2 Applications in Geotechnical Engineering", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Slope stability analysis", "content": "Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be trained to accurately predict three-dimensional slope stability [1]. Novel models have been used to estimate earth slope stability based on ANN with similar accuracies as the existing mathematical expressions [2]. Qian et al. [3] adopted ANN to develop a stability assessment tool for in-homogeneous soil slopes to minimize manual reading errors when using slope stability chart solutions. ANN are often used in conjunction with other methods to predict the factor of safety (FOS) of slopes [4]. The influence of slope engineering parameters on their stability was investigated using ANN [5].By proper training, an ANN, as illustrated in Fig. 1, with a desirable transfer function and a suitable number of hidden layers, can reasonably predict the nonlinearities and provide an accurate slope stability estimation.Using slope tangent, angle of internal friction, slope height, cohesion, unit weight, and the stability number as input parameters, Abdalla et al. [7] concluded that ANN models are reliable, simple, and valid computational tools for predicting the FOS andfor assessing the stability of slopes of clayey soil. Training and testing data-setstypically used for the ANN slope stability analysis are obtained using various limit equilibrium analysis methods [8-11].Many factors contribute to the considerable uncertainty surrounding the stability of slopes, and considering these uncertainties, designees have been forced to include a safety factor [12]. The theory of fuzzy sets deals with the uncertain nature of soil parameters and uncertainties involved in the analysis [13]. Fuzzy set theory is a valuable tool for rock engineers and engineering geologists who study rock slope stability [14].Mohamed et al. [15] set out to use a fuzzy logic system to predict the stability of slopes. Several significant parameters were employed as inputs, including the internal friction angle, slope height, unit weight of slope material, slope angle, coefficient of cohesion, and internal friction angle; the output parameter was the safety factor. The outcomes demonstrated its high accuracy in predicting the safety factors. Fuzzy logic-based decision-making was used by Azarafza et al. [16] to quickly evaluate block-toppling failure instability in discontinuous rock slopes, as supported by kinematic analysis applied to actual cases. They made the point that fuzzy logic enhances kinematic analyses by providing a more precise stability assessment.Genetic algorithm (GA), due to its efficiency and stability in finding global optimum solutions, was used to improve spatial landslide prediction by Palazzolo et al. [17]. Genetic algorithms are usually hybridized with other methods for the calculation of FOS of slopes [18-20]. GA can be used to quickly find the non-circularfailure surface with the lowest safety factor, as failure surfaces tend to be non-circularfor layered slopes [21].In order to examine the convergence of the failure probability of soil slopesreinforced with piles, Chen et al. [22] proposed a method for determining theminimum samples of simulation iterations. The findings showed that boring pileswould create multiple potential sliding surfaces, increasing the uncertainty of slopefailures. In Ji et al. [23] study, where the seismic stability of earth slopes subjected todeep failure was probabilistically investigated, a first-order reliability method wasintroduced for addressing uncertainties and computing the probability of failure. Chenet al. [24] employed a probabilistic analysis method to assess the failure probability ofsubmarine landslides caused by hydrate exploitation. According to probabilisticanalyses, the failure probability was significantly influenced by both the slope angleand the production temperature.Probability analysis on slope stability includes the combination of random fieldtheory and the conventional slope stability evaluation methods, such as the randomlimit equilibrium method (RLEM) and the random finite element method (RFEM)[25]."}, {"title": "2.2 Soil behavior", "content": "Rani's [26] proposed ANN model was used to predict soil engineering properties like permeability, compressibility, and shear strength parameters, and was found to be quite satisfactory. Similarly, Kiran and Lal [27] adopted ANN as a prediction tool to determine the internal friction angle and cohesion based on some index properties such as water content, plasticity index, bulk density, sand %, silt %, and clay %. In the same study, a simplified methodology for ANN is presented, as shown in Figure 2.ANN is used in Rashidianand & Hassanlourad [28] work to describe the complex behavior of different carbonate soils accurately. In order to validate a deep learning method proposed by Zhang et al. [29] for modeling soil's stress-strain behavior, ANN was used as a benchmark.In Dewidar et al. [30] study, a fuzzy-based model that is more accurate than conventional methods was developed to predict soil infiltration rate. The developed fuzzy model was tested against the observed data and multiple linear regression. The coefficient of determination, root mean square error, mean absolute error, model efficiency, and overall index of the fuzzy model were 0.953, 1.53, 1.28, 0.953, and 0.954, respectively. The corresponding MLR model values were 0.913, 2.37, 1.92, 0.913, and 0.914, respectively. The results also showed that clay is the most important factor in predicting soil infiltration rate, as silt and clay were used as input variables.Sujatha et al. [31] proposed a fuzzy knowledge-based model that can be accurately and quickly used to predict the soil type and its rating for suitability in airfield applications without a need to perform any manual work, such as using tables or charts. Fi\u015fne et al. [32] found that peak particle velocity (PPV) can be used to assess ground vibration levels. The distance between the blast face and the vibration monitoring point and the charge weight per delay are employed as fuzzy logic parameters to estimate the PPV. The comparison of the measured and projected values of PPV revealed that the fuzzy model's correlation coefficient (0.96) is greater than the regression model's (0.82). Moonjun et al. [33] fine-scale soil mapping research revealed that fuzzy logic may be used to map with a relatively low density ofsoil samples, which may reduce costs and inconsistencies compared to standard methods.The results of a GA-based neural network by Johari et al. [34] were compared with experimental results and were found to be accurate and robust in modelling the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. Hassanlourad et al. [35] inculcated GA in an attempt to predict the compaction parameters of soils by ANN. They trained and tested their model with 212 data-sets and with the aid of sensitivity analysis, found that liquid limit and plastic limit were the most influential parameters on the compaction parameters. GA models were used to predict the unconfined compressive strength of geopolymer stabilized clayey soils [36]. Based on a comprehensive set of triaxial tests data, GA-based ANN was concluded to have a good potential in predicting the shear behavior of carbonate sands [37]. GA also performs well in solving soil-structure interaction problems [38].A Bayesian framework for probabilistic soil stratification is developed in Cao et al.[39] paper, utilizing the soil behavior type index profile computed from cone penetration test data. According to the results, the suggested method correctlydetermines the most likely soil stratigraphy based on the soil behavior type indexprofile and previous knowledge. The effect of structural health monitoring on asimulated sheet pile wall system's failure probability was examined by Chai et al.[40]. They estimated non-directly observable soil parameters from measuredstructural responses using Bayesian statistics. Their findings suggest that usingBayesian statistics in conjunction with structural health monitoring is a viable strategyto significantly lower our level of uncertainty when modeling hydraulic structuresand, consequently, raise the calculated safety of those structures."}, {"title": "2.3 Foundation bearing capacity and settlement", "content": "A new hybrid artificial neural network and mathematical model was proposed by Aouadj and Bouafia [41] to enhance the capacity to predict the load-settlement behavior of shallow foundations in sandy soils. The proposed model was developed and validated using 110 full-scale loading tests of shallow foundations conducted in sand with cone penetration test (CPT) results. In terms of root mean square error, it was discovered that the suggested model outperforms traditional techniques by a margin of over 29%. Mill\u00e1n et al. [42] research adopted an ANN solution to predict the bearing capacity due to general shear failure obtained from numerical calculations based on the Hoek and Brown criterion. The predictions from the ANN model are in agreement with the numerical results.Jebur et al. [43] looked at pile bearing capacity to create a solid model for simulating pile load-settlement behavior with a novel ANN technique. With a comparatively negligible mean square error level (MSE) of 0.0019, the proficiency metric indicators showed an exceptional degree of agreement between the measured and predicted pile-load settlement, resulting in a correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.99, 0.043, respectively. ANN models can effectively predict the ultimate bearing capacity of a circular foundation on the sand layer of limited thickness when subjected to eccentric and inclined load [44]. Gnananandarao et al. [45] applied ANN and multivariable regression analysis (MRA) to predict thebearing capacity and the settlement of multi-edge skirted footings on sand, they foundthat the predicted bearing capacity ratio and settlement reduction factor for the multi-edge skirted footings with the use of ANN is superior to MRA.The work of Pramanik et al. [46] uses the fuzzy set theory concept to analyzereliability based on foundation failure against bearing capacity. According to theirfindings, the soil's friction angle has the most significant impact out of all thevariables. A fuzzy-based model hybridized with particle swarm optimizationeffectively estimated the bearing capacity of strip foundations rested on cohesionlessslopes [47]. Similarly, the hybridized fuzzy model showed the highest predictabilityperformance against all employed models in Mohammed et al.'s [48] study, whichfocused on quantifying shallow foundation settlement.GA optimizes other soft computing models to solve bearing capacity andsettlement problems. Here are some examples:a. It optimizes the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-polynomialneural network (PNN) structure in Jahed Armaghani et al.'s [49] work toproduce more accurate results than other methods considered for the load-carrying capacity assessment of thin-walled foundations.b. In Liu et al.'s [50] work, GA-ANN models performed best in estimating themaximum settlement of eco-friendly raft-pile foundation systems amongstconventional ANN and fuzzy logic models.c. ANN was optimized using GA and particle swarm optimization (PSO) topredict pile-bearing capacity. The results showed that both hybridapproaches could predict bearing capacity with a high degree of accuracy;however, the PSO-ANN predictive model is more useful in terms ofperformance capacity. This is due to a higher R2 performance index [51].In order to calibrate the resistance factor for the pile foundation design, Zhang etal. [52] study set out to create a Bayesian network-based machine-learning techniquethat would generate site-specific statistics of the model bias factor using data fromboth the regional and site-specific load test data. It was discovered that a smallnumber of site-specific pile load test results could significantly lower the uncertaintyrelated to the model bias factor, increasing the pile design's cost-effectiveness.Christodoulou and Pantelidis [53] focused on specific field research to achieve anideal design, attempting to lower statistical uncertainty in the elastic settlementanalysis of shallow foundations. Based on an advanced probabilistic framework thattakes into account sampling of soil property values and applies the Random FiniteElement Method (RFEM), their work is conducted. This work demonstrates that theappropriate sampling strategy can greatly decrease the statistical error."}, {"title": "3 Applications in Water Resources Engineering", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Discharge forecasting", "content": "The performance of artificial neural networks (ANN), which are being used increasingly for flood forecasting, depends on the choice of relevant inputs [54]. Hadiyan et al. [55] applied static and dynamic artificial neural networks forforecasting inflow discharges and found that their results provide useful informationfor reservoir inflow simulation. According to Dtissibe et al. [56], artificial neuralnetworks schemes, as opposed to physical-based flood forecasting methods, considerall the parameters involved in the flood modeling, which can vary along a channel.ANN helps accurately model the rainfall-runoff process for catchments [57].Artificial neural network (ANN) models were created and trained using variousrainfall patterns in Ali & Shahbaz's [58] work to forecast daily river stream flow. The results showed that the ANN model created by presenting rainfall patterns of the previous four days can accurately predict the daily stream flow with values of R\u00b2 forthe validation and test periods of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively.Fuzzy logic can be implemented in river basins where adequate hydrologic data is available, but it is not good enough for a more sophisticated model [59]. Tabbussum and Dar [60] proposed an efficient fuzzy inference system to improve floods' real-time forecasting. The reliability and robustness of the fuzzy logic approach wer demonstrated with daily and 6-hourly discharge predictions in 4 rivers in 3 countries having contrasting climatological, geographical, and land use characteristics [61]. As illustrated in Figure 3, a fuzzy logic system was among the machine learningframeworks considered for flood forecasting in Puttinaovarat and Horkaew [62] work.Nguyen et al. [63] forecast discharge accurately using GA. They specifically used GAto suggest a novel mechanism that can automatically identify the ideal hyper-parameters for their prediction model. According to their findings, the suggested solution performs better than existing methods in various metrics. Young et al. [64] study used HEC-HMS (Hydrological engineering center hydrological modeling system) model combined with GANN (Genetic algorithm neural network) and ANFIS (Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) to predict the runoff discharge of a watershed.

From the findings, theANN model, as illustrated in Figure 5, outperformed other models except the SVM).Noori et al. [69] combined a process-based watershed model and ANN to improve thewater quality predictions in unmonitored watersheds.Fuzzy logic can be applied to accurately assess groundwater quality and eliminateinherent errors [70]. In contrast to prevalent indices like the National SanitationFoundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and the Vedprakash Water Quality Index(VWQI), Nayak et al. [71] found that the values of the fuzzy-based water qualityindex are more representative of the actual river water quality status of Indian rivers.Jha et al. [72] proposed a novel hybrid framework for evaluating groundwater qualityand its spatial variability that combines Fuzzy Logic with the GeographicalInformation System (GIS) based Groundwater Quality Index (GQI). The fuzzy logic-based decision-making approach (FGQI) was found to be more practical anddependable when assessing and analyzing groundwater quality at larger scales, likebasin or watershed scales. Mallik et al. [73] equally analyzed groundwater suitabilityfor drinking by utilizing fuzzy logic in the geographical Information System (GIS)platform. Ghorbani et al.

To simulate the performance of the Tamburawa water treatment plant in terms of pH and turbidity, Abba et al. [86] used ANN. The overall results of the models showed the reliability and satisfactory performance of ANN in modeling the performance efficiency of the water treatment plant (WTP). Solaimany-Aminabad et al. [87] predicted the influent water quality of the Sanandaj water treatment plant (WTP) using an ANN approach and a feed-forward back-propagation non-linear autoregressive neural network. The predicting ANN model offers an efficient diagnostic and analysis tool to comprehend and replicate the non-linear behavior of the influent water characteristics. Tashaouie et al.'s [88] also utilized ANN in predicting the performance of pressure filters in a water treatment.Sant\u00edn et al. [89] presented a novel control approach that utilizes a fuzzy controller to adjust the internal recirculation flow rate in wastewater treatment plants. The results demonstrate improvements in reducing ammonia limit violations, total nitrogen limit violations, and pumping energy costs by implementing the suggested fuzzy controller. The uncertainty and challenges that arise when choosing an effective treatment strategy are mitigated by linear diophantine fuzzy sets [90]. The consistency and resilience of decision-making in these drinking WTP can be enhanced using fuzzy inference systems, which can aid in consolidating the process of knowledge gained through years of experience [91]. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is suggested by Okoji et al. [92] to forecast trihalomethane (THM) levels in real distribution systems. ANFIS demonstrated efficacy in anticipating THM formation based on the statistical indices obtained, thereby facilitating enhanced monitoring of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in water treatment systems.Findings from the work of Gupta & Shrivastava [93] show that using GA in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is a reliable way to consistently arrive at the optimal or nearly optimal solution for the reliability constrained WTP design problem. In Swan et al. [94] study, operational regimes for water treatment were optimized using verified static and dynamic models of operational works in conjunction with GA and Monte Carlo conditions. In Al-Obaidi et al.'s [95] work, GA was developed for a reverse osmosis wastewater system performance to solve a formulated optimization problem involving two objective functions, which are to maximize the solute rejection at different cases of feed concentration and minimize the operating pressure to improve economic aspects. An intelligent system with GA-based operations with fitness values and a neural network for training was proposedby Sophia et al. [96]. By calculating the objective function of different populationtypes, the system can be used to increase optimization performance by makingpredictions about water consumption and distribution using decision-makingalgorithms.The study by Zhu and McBean [97] showed that Bayesian decision networks(BDNs) could offer a normative framework to help with WTP problem solving.Bertone et al.

The study concluded by implementing hazard controlmeasures and identifying areas for improvement."}, {"title": "5.3 Disease Spread Prediction", "content": "Wang et al. [131", "132": "applied artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dengue fever outbreak occurrences in San Juan, Puerto Rico (USA), and in several coastal municipalities of the state of Yucatan, Mexico, based on specific thresholds. The models were trained with 19 years of dengue fever data for Puerto Rico and six years for Mexico. The predictive power was above 70% for all four model runs. The ANNs were able to successfully model dengue fever outbreak occurrences in both study areas.Traulsen & Krieter [133"}]}

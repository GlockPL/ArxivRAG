It is essential to discover and secure raw materials critical for global infrastructure, technological advancement, and sustainable development (Gocht et al., 2012). Nowadays, remote-sensing satellite imaging studies are widely and effectively used in mineral exploration, offering an efficient, cost-effective alternative to traditional field surveys (Van der Meer et al., 2012; Bedini, 2017; Ousmanou et al., 2024).\nIn remote-sensing mineral exploration, human experts typically follow: identifying geological features from images like faults and fractures, integrating multiple hyperspectral images to detect mineralization patterns, and synthesizing these into a mineral prospectivity map (MPM) to predict mineral deposit locations (Sabins, 1999; Shirmard et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2021). These processes are manual, time-intensive, and reliant on expert knowledge, necessitating automated machine learning and deep learning (DL) solutions for scalability.\nTo this end, DL models, e.g., CNNs (Alzubaidi et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023) and Transformers (Yin et al., 2024a), have been widely applied to process remote-sensing (RS) data. These methods excel at extracting features from RS images, mapping geological, geochemical, and geophysical attributes to predict mineral deposits (Yang et al., 2024). However, their data-driven nature makes them reliant on labeled datasets, limiting their generalization to new geological scenarios. In contrast, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently emerged with remarkable zero-shot capabilities, integrating visual and textual contexts to tackle tasks (Muhtar et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024c; Wang et al., 2024a) without requiring task-specific training data (Yin et al., 2024b).\nDespite their promise, MLLMs face critical challenges when applied to mineral exploration with multiple RS images: they lack domain-specific geological knowledge (Zhang et al., 2024b) and struggle to reason effectively across multiple images (Liu et al., 2024b; Zhao et al., 2024). What's worse, domain-specific instructions (e.g., thousands of tokens) and multi-image inputs (e.g., 9 images) exacerbate the challenge by long-context issues that hinder reasoning accuracy (Liu et al., 2024c). For example, Figure 1(a) highlights how MLLMs struggle with critical spatial elements like the strategic placement of low-value areas (blue). besides, in Figure 1(b), MLLMs demonstrate significant difficulty in synthesizing spatial relationships across multiple geological contexts.\nTo circumvent the challenges of domain-specific knowledge integration and multi-image reasoning in mineral exploration, we propose MineAgent, a modular MLLM framework specifically designed to address these complexities (Figure 3)."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Multi-image Reasoning of MLLMs. Recent studies have revealed a significant performance gap between single- and multi-image reasoning tasks (Liu et al., 2024d; Wang et al., 2024b; Jiang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Liu et al., 2024b). For instance, Wang et al. (2024d) highlighted deficiencies in temporal and contextual reasoning across image sequences while Zhao et al. (2024) explored multi-dimensional aspects of multi-image reasoning, such as perception, knowledge integration, reasoning, and multi-hop inference. However, domain-specific tasks, such as those in mineral exploration, pose unique challenges requiring not only multi-image reasoning but also domain-specific knowledge. This motivates us to present MineBench to evaluate MLLMs' reasoning capabilities within a long-tail domain rigorously.\nRemote Sensing MLLMs. The application of MLLMs in remote sensing has gained traction for tasks like image captioning and visual question answering (Zhan et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021). These models, fine-tuned with extensive visual-text instructions, demonstrate strong performance on single-image tasks (Kuckreja et al., 2024; Zhan et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024). However, their capabilities remain limited when extended to multi-image reasoning, a critical requirement"}, {"title": "3 MineBench: on Remote-sensing Images", "content": "The field of mineral exploration currently lacks a well-organized benchmark to evaluate the performance of MLLMs. Existing ones do not capture the unique challenges of integrating geological knowledge with multimodal reasoning. These motivate us to present a new mineral exploration benchmark.\nTask Formulation. Mineral exploration enables quantifiable assessments of deposit likelihood, facilitating prioritization of exploration areas, so it is usually formulated as a binary classification problem (Alzubaidi et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), i.e.,\n$y \\sim P_\\theta(y|a) := P_\\theta(\\cdot|I_a) = P_\\theta(\\cdot|I_a^{(g)}, I_a^{(h)})$ (1)\nwhere $y \\in Y$ represents the presence of mineral deposits with $y = \\{0,1\\}$ in a targeted area $a$ and $a$ can be represented as a set of remote-sensing images, $I_a$. In mineral exploration, according to distinct roles and nature of the data, $I_a$ can be coarsely grouped into two sub-sets, i.e., geological images ($I_a^{(g)}$) and hyperspectral images ($I_a^{(h)}$).\nRemote-sensing Images in Mineral Exploration. Geological images ($I_a^{(g)}$, see Figure 2(a)) focus on capturing macroscopic spatial and morphological features, such as landforms, tectonic structures, and geological units, which are critical for identifying large-scale mineralization patterns and structural controls, whereas hyperspectral images ($I_a^{(h)}$, see Figure 2(b)) are designed to capture high-resolution spectral reflectance data across a wide range of wavelengths, enabling the detailed characterization and differentiation of mineral types and their spatial distributions at a pixel-by-pixel level.\nData Sourcing and Preprocessing. We utilized raw remote-sensing data from the Geoscience Western Australia (GSWA) repository\u00b9, an open-source geoscience data source (Portal), to compose MineBench. Although the raw remote-sensing images encompass all necessary information to infer mineral exploration tasks, the raw hyperspectral images, $I_a^{(h)}$, are not intuitive for visualizing mineralization patterns (Sabins, 1999). This limitation makes it considerably challenging for MLLMs or even humans to identify meaningful deposit signatures directly because such tasks require extensive domain knowledge in mineral exploration to interpret and process the raw data effectively. Therefore, following common practices in mineral exploration (Yazdi et al., 2018; Wambo et al., 2020; Ghamisi et al., 2017), we preprocess the raw hyperspectral images using domain-specific linear combinations to generate three distinct deposit signature images, $I_a^{(s)}$ (see Figure 2(bottom)). These signature images provide a visually interpretable representation of key features in deposit formation, significantly reducing task complexity for both human experts and automated models. Consequently, MineBench is formulated as\n$y \\sim P_\\theta(y|I_a^{(g)}, I_a^{(s)})$. (2)\nMore details on data sourcing and preprocessing are provided in Appendix A and B, respectively.\nData Labeling and Sampling. We access the deposit locations directly sourced from authoritative records as class labels\u00b2 \u2013 \u2018positive' as $y = 1$ and 'negative' as $y = 0$. Considering the inherent class imbalance in real-world mineral exploration, a strategic random sampling approach was employed to ensure robust evaluation close to real-world scenarios. The resulting dataset consists of 73 positive areas and 539 negative areas, yielding an ~1:9 positive-to-negative ratio, leading to reliable and statistically meaningful evaluations (Hewson et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Alvarez et al., 2020)."}, {"title": "4 Methodology", "content": "To leverage the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in mineral exploration, we naturally formulate the task as a visual question-answering (VQA) problem. Specifically, given remote-sensing images (e.g., $I^{(g)}$ and $I^{(s)}$) and a domain-specific query about the presence of a particular mineral deposit, the model generates a response indicating the likelihood of the deposit. This response can then be mapped to a classification label using a predefined verbalizer, i.e.,\n$\\hat{o} \\sim M(I^{(g)}, I^{(s)}; \\theta)$, (4)\nwhere $\\theta$ parameterizes the MLLM, M, and $\\hat{o}$ denotes a natural language response with verbalizer.\nDespite the simplicity in Eq.(4), the inherent limitations of MLLMs in lacking domain-specific geological knowledge pose significant challenges \u2014 they struggle with interpreting complex hyperspectral imaging data and understanding spatial patterns critical for mineral exploration.\n4.1 Baseline: Mineral Exploration Pipeline\nTo alleviate the lack of domain knowledge, we first propose a baseline framework that integrates the conventional mineral exploration pipeline with domain-specific instructions to enhance the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This pipeline emulates the workflow of human experts in mineral exploration by leveraging step-by-step structured prompts and reasoning mechanisms. Formally, let P denote a curated set of domain-specific prompts tailored for the task. These prompts are carefully designed to encode key domain knowledge and guide the MLLM through"}, {"title": "4.2 MineAgent: Orchestrating over Remote-sensing Images", "content": "However, the above is still vulnerable to multi-image reasoning as MLLMs struggle to synthesize spatial and contextual relationships across multiple images and long contexts, leading to incomplete understandings of multiple remote-sensing images for mineral exploration. Therefore, we propose an agent framework, MineAgent, that decomposes the exploration process into modular components.\n4.2.1 General MineAgent Framework\nMineAgent focuses on two core kinds of modules to enhance its reasoning capabilities: judging and decision-making, as shown in Figure 4. While a judging module specializes in extracting specific features from remote-sensing images (e.g., geological structures or spectral mineralization signatures), a decision-making module is designed for a specific task to integrate these features to perform high-level reasoning tasks, such as inferring mineral deposit likelihood or validating predictions across diverse datasets.\nJudging Modules in Hierarchy. A judging module operates with two types of inputs to maintain focus and robustness in feature extraction, i.e.,\nc~ J(I,C;$\\theta$), where C = \\{C\\}_0^N. (7)\nThe first type of input includes one or a few single-category remote-sensing images, I, such as geological or hyperspectral images, ensuring that the module specializes in analyzing a specific feature (e.g., structural patterns or deposit signatures). The second type of input comes from the outputs, C, of other judging modules, enabling a hierarchical structure. And either of them is optional. This setup allows for cross-image reasoning and intermediate result validation, effectively integrating insights from multiple sources. By focusing on specific features while facilitating inter-module communication, this approach circumvents the challenges of multi-image reasoning in complex mineral exploration tasks.\nCommunication Protocol. A well-defined communication protocol is critical for ensuring efficient information exchange between modules. Each module in MineAgent communicates using a semi-structured output format,\nC_i = \\{s_i, a_i, c_i\\}, (8)\nwhere $s_i$ is a numerical score reflecting the module's confidence or evaluation, $a_i$ represents the identified favorable areas or features, and $c_i$ provides an analytical explanation or rationale behind"}, {"title": "5 Experiment", "content": "Metric. Due to the inherent class imbalance in MineBench, multiple complementary metrics are employed. The F1 score for positive classes (Pos.F1) evaluates the MLLMs' ability to identify deposits. The macro-averaged F1 score (Avg.F1) provides balanced assessment across classes, while the ROC-AUC evaluates discriminative ability. Additionally, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) provides a comprehensive evaluation by synthesizing the confusion matrix ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates complete misclassification, 1 represents perfect prediction (Chicco and Jurman, 2020). The details of the experimental setup are provided in Appendix D.\n5.1 Main Results\nTable 2 presents the comparative performance of various MLLMs: Qwen2-VL-7B/72B (Bai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c), Gemini-Flash-2.0 (Team et al., 2024), Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT- 40 (OpenAI, 2024), LLaVA-13B (Liu et al., 2023b, 2024a), Yi-6B/34B (Young et al., 2024) and InterVL-26B (Chen et al., 2024) on MineBench. This evaluation highlights several key findings regarding the strengths and limitations of the MLLMs:\nEffectiveness of MineAgent. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by MineAgent, with the highest improvement reaching 30.14% when paired with GPT-40 and 23.77% when paired with Qwen-7B. This result highlights the potential of MineAgent in enhancing multi-image reasoning and domain-specific gaps. Few open-source MLLMs show performance degradation when integrated with MineAgent, primarily due to their unstable reasoning capabilities in interpreting score criteria. During base pipeline evaluations, inconsistent outputs also emerged, such as assigning a score of 5 as \"positive\u201d and a score of 9 as \u201cnegative.\u201d No"}, {"title": "5.2 MLLM Capabilities Evaluation", "content": "To assess MLLMs across varying levels of analytical complexity, we introduce a three-tiered evaluation framework.

The evaluation employed 20% of the MineBench, with samples selected randomly while maintaining the original positive-negative class distribution. The quantitative results (Figure 6) reveal two key findings:\nModel-Human Agreement. GPT-4o achieved significantly higher Pearson correlation and weighted Kappa scores than Qwen-7B across all evaluation criteria This strong alignment with human expert scoring patterns correlates with the models' overall performance, validating that higher-performing models better approximate human evaluation strategies (Ouyang et al., 2022).\nChallenges in Complex Task. The output c6 exhibited the lowest consistency scores, falling well below the average. This result underscores a key limitation: even advanced methods face difficulties extracting features from multi-image reasoning, which emphasizes the current shortcomings of MLLMs in handling complex mineral exploration scenarios. Additionally, the score distributions are visualized in Appendix C, providing a comprehensive overview of their respective scoring tendencies. The consistency between scores and explanations in the MLLM responses is evaluated in Appendix E."}, {"title": "5.4 Ablation Studies", "content": "We conducted ablation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of MineAgent by analyzing its components using GPT-40. Four variants were designed and evaluated to investigate the role of each component in handling tasks of different complexity levels. 1) MineAgent: The framework incorporates all components, including the judging modules, communication protocol, and decision-making modules. 2) w/o J: A variant of MineAgent that removes the judging modules, implementing the exploration pipeline in a single inference. 3) w/o JC: Extending w/o J, this version further excludes the communication protocol, resulting in the absence of detailed scoring guidelines.(4) BASE: A simplified version that additionally excludes the decision-making module, producing $\\hat{o}^{(pipeline)}$ as the result.\nThe results show MineAgent effectively reduces reasoning complexity by decomposing the pipeline into manageable components: The removal of judging modules led to a 7.05% decline in the MCC score. Excluding the detailed scoring guidelines within the communication protocol caused a substantial performance drop. Further, the decision-making modules played a critical role in enhancing the MLLM's capability to navigate the exploration pipeline. The details of the decision-making modules are further analyzed in Appendix D, showing their effectiveness. In the \u201cEasy\u201d setting, an unexpected performance pattern emerged: the w/o JC variant outperformed the full MineAgent framework. This result aligns with prior findings: while existing MLLMs excel in basic visual reasoning, they often struggle with complex multi-image and domain-specific tasks (Kazemi et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we present MineAgent, a novel MLLM agent framework designed to address critical challenges in multi-image reasoning and domain-specific gap for mineral exploration.

Introduction", "content": "Taste perception fundamentally influences food selection and consumption\nbehavior1,2. Taste peptides, emerging as natural taste-modulating compounds,\nhave attracted considerable attention3,4. These bioactive peptides, comprising\n2-20 amino acid residues5,6, can trigger multiple taste perceptions including\nsweet, umami, and salty tastes, without the drawbacks of conventional\nflavoring agents5,7. They offer distinct advantages: easily metabolized and\nabsorbed due to their natural amino acid composition8,9, simultaneous multiple\ntaste modalities reducing the need for various flavorings10,11, and additional\nhealth-promoting functions such as antioxidization12,13 and\nanti-inflammatory14,15 properties, unlike traditional flavoring agents (such as\nsodium chloride, sucrose, and monosodium glutamate) that may cause health\nissues16-19. This combination of sensory enhancement and health benefits\npresents a promising solution to the palatability-health paradox in modern food\nindustry20,21.\nAdvances in taste peptide research have demonstrated significant applications.\nIn salt reduction, specific peptides maintain sensory qualities while reducing\nNaCl content in meat products22,23. A decapeptide (0.4 g/L) from fermented tofu\nenhances 50 mM NaCl perception to 63 mM equivalent24. And a peptide from\nRuditapes philippinarum hydrolysate elevates 3 g/L NaCl perception to 5 g/L\nequivalent25,26. For sugar reduction, sweet peptides like aspartame27 and\nneotame28 are widely used, with aspartame showing additional\nanti-inflammatory benefits29,30. Sweet peptides from mulberry seed protein\ndemonstrate six-fold higher sweetness than 0.1 g/mL sucrose31. Umami\npeptides from various food sources enhance flavor while reducing salt and\nmonosodium glutamate usage through synergistic interactions11,23,32.\nHowever, traditional identification methods for taste peptides face substantial\nchallenges33,34. The conventional workflow of preprocessing, extraction,\npurification, synthesis, and sensory evaluation remains time-consuming and\nresource-intensive, yielding limited peptide samples35,36. Furthermore,\nbiological sample complexity and experimental variations may result in\nlimitations in taste peptide applications, including toxicity risks37,38, stability\nissues39, or inadequate taste properties40, significantly increasing development\ncosts and complexity.\nTo address these experimental challenges, various computational and artificial\nintelligence-based approaches for taste peptide identification have emerged.\nMost reported methods focus on predicting single taste properties, such as"}, {"title": "2. Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Comprehensive analysis reveals the sequence characteristics and\ncomplex taste properties of taste peptides", "content": "The taste peptides collected in this study demonstrate a clear predominance of\nshort sequences, with 88.54% of the collected peptides not exceeding 10\namino acids in length, while sequences of 15 amino acids or longer constitute\nless than 3% (Figure 2A). To reduce data noise and enhance model specificity,\nwe excluded sequences of 15 amino acids or longer (blue columns, Figure 2A)\nfrom subsequent modeling. Regarding taste type distribution, the curated\ndataset exhibits significant imbalance: umami (575) and bitter (541) peptides\ndominate, while sour (201), sweet (162), and salty (141) peptides are relatively\nunderrepresented (Figure 2B). This distribution pattern likely stems from two\nkey factors: the application potential of umami peptides in food flavor enhancer\ndevelopment has driven related research20,34,50, while the preferential\ngeneration mechanism of bitter peptides during protein proteolysis leads to\ntheir prevalence in fermented products51,52. Amino acid composition analysis\n(Figure 2C) reveals diverse residue distribution patterns among different taste\npeptides, with sour and umami peptides showing high compositional similarity,\nwhile salty and bitter peptides are distinguished by high frequencies of aspartic"}, {"title": "2.2. LA-VAE: a loss-supervised adaptive variational autoencoder with\ncontrastive learning for controlled taste peptide generation", "content": "To address the intricate sequence-function relationships of taste peptides, we\ndeveloped LA-VAE as the core algorithm of TastePepAl. LA-VAE introduces an\ninnovative dynamic loss supervision mechanism that enables precise control\nover the model training process (Figure 3A). This mechanism partitions the\ntraining process into two complementary optimization phases: an initial\nexploration phase (Phase I) that continuously tracks and records the global\noptimal loss, and a convergence optimization phase (Phase II) that captures\noptimal latent space representations through strict dual constraints\n(simultaneous decrease in both reconstruction loss and KL divergence). This\nloss-aware adaptive optimization framework not only provides an effective\nmodel state capture mechanism but also establishes a dynamically balanced\nquality control system for sequence generation. Notably, when the\nconvergence phase fails to achieve expected performance improvements,\nLA-VAE automatically triggers an elastic extension mechanism that continues\nto explore optimal solutions through configurable extension cycles, thereby\nensuring the reliability of generated sequences. This multi-phase collaborative\noptimization strategy significantly enhances both model convergence\nefficiency and generation quality.\nTo meet the demands for precise control of specific taste properties (e.g., bitter\ntaste elimination40,53) in practical applications, we incorporated a contrastive\nlearning-based taste avoidance mechanism into the LA-VAE architecture\n(Figure 3B). This mechanism allows users to explicitly specify desired"}, {"title": "2.3. SpepToxPred: a specialized short peptide toxicity predictor", "content": "SpepToxPred, another core component of TastePepAl, was developed to\nevaluate the toxicity (including hemolytic activity54, neurotoxicity55, etc.) of\nsequences generated by LA-VAE. A total of 6861 toxic and 9183 non-toxic\npeptides from multiple public databases and literature were integrated (see"}, {"title": "2.4. Design and validation of safe taste peptides via TastePepAl", "content": "To demonstrate the practical utility of TastePepAl, we designed a challenging\ncase study targeting the development of safe taste modulators. Given the\nhealth concerns associated with conventional taste enhancers, there is\nsignificant value in developing safe alternatives for sweet31, salty\u00b3, and\numami23,34 tastes. We therefore employed TastePepAl to generate novel\nsequences exhibiting these three basic tastes (individually or in combination)\nwhile maintaining safety and reducing bitterness. To achieve this, the training\ndataset was constructed by using peptides with target taste properties (sweet,\nsalty, and umami, single or combined) without bitterness as positive samples,\nwhile bitter peptides served as negative samples for LA-VAE training. This\nmulti-taste positive sampling strategy effectively captured the diversity and\ncomplexity of taste-sequence relationships, enabling comprehensive learning\nof sequence-taste association patterns.\nTo gain deeper insights into the training dynamics and optimization process of\nLA-VAE, we implemented a comprehensive training cycle of 500 epochs and\nmonitored three critical time points (Figure S5A, B). During the early phase\n(Step 1, epoch 10), although the total loss remained relatively high\n(Losstol=7.5719 for positive training and Losstol=0.7356 for negative training),\nthe model demonstrated rapid convergence. In the first-half optimization phase\n(Step 2), the model achieved initial optimal performance (Losstol=0.2088 for\npositive training and Losstol=0.1720 for negative training), followed by the\nglobal optimization phase (Step 3) where even lower loss values were attained\n(Losstol=0.1817 for positive training and Losstol=0.1658 for negative samples).\nNotably, both reconstruction loss (Lossrec) and KL divergence (LoSSKL)\nexhibited synchronized reduction throughout the training process. The model's\nrepresentational capacity showed progressive enhancement, with generated\nsamples initially displaying distinct separation from positive samples in the\nlatent space (Step 1, Figure S5C), followed by gradual convergence and\nsubstantial overlap with the positive sample distribution (Step 2, 3, Figure S5D,\nE). Intriguingly, while positive (purple) and negative (green) samples showed\nclear separation in the early training phase (Step 1), this distinct boundary\ngradually diminished as training progressed (Steps 2 and 3). This\nphenomenon further emphasizes the inherent overlapping characteristics and\ncomplexity of taste peptide sequences, highlighting the importance of our\ndeveloped contrastive learning-based taste control mechanism that relies on\nEuclidean distance calculations.\nCharacteristic analysis of the generated sequences demonstrated that LA-VAE\nnot only successfully captured key features of target sequences but also\nexhibited remarkable innovation. Specifically, the amino acid distribution of\ngenerated sequences maintained high similarity with positive samples (Figure\nS6A), reflecting the model's accurate learning of amino acid compositional\npatterns. Sequence similarity analysis revealed that the majority of generated\npeptides showed less than 50% sequence identity to positive samples (Figure\nS6B), strongly confirming the model's capability for deep feature extraction and\nnovel sequence recombination rather than simple template copying or minor\nmodifications. Furthermore, these novel sequences effectively preserved\ncritical physicochemical properties of positive samples, including charge\ndistribution, hydrophobicity, and hydrophobic ratio parameters (Figure S6C-L).\nThrough TastePepAl's automated screening pipeline, we manually selected 73\ncandidate peptides for experimental validation. These peptides were\nsynthesized by Fmoc-solid peptide synthesis, and their purity exceeded 98%.\nAll peptides exhibited excellent safety profiles at 100 \u00b5M, maintaining cell\nviability above 90% (Figure S7A) and hemolysis rates below 1.5% (Figure\nS7B). Electronic tongue analysis (Figure 5, Table S1, 2) revealed complex\ntaste characteristics: at 0.1 mg/mL, all peptides demonstrated sweet and\numami properties; at 1 mg/mL, salty characteristics emerged universally.\nNotably, certain peptides (e.g., TaPep8-11) exhibited relatively strong sweet\nand umami intensities at low concentrations while displaying different salty\nintensities at high concentrations, reflecting the complex dynamics of taste\nperception. Additionally, only few peptides (e.g., TaPep5, TaPep7, TaPep10)\nshowed bitterness suppression at the high concentration (1 mg/mL). This\nlimited bitterness suppression might be attributed to residual impurities from\npeptide synthesis (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid, sodium acetate) potentially\ninterfering with sensory evaluation10,56,57, coupled with possible taste\nevaluation blind spots in training data labeled as 'currently without\nbitterness'58,59. Consequently, accurate assessment of bitterness suppression\nrequires further validation.\nNevertheless, TastePepAl successfully designed and validated 73 novel\nfunctional peptides with multiple target taste properties (sweet, salty, and\numami), significantly expanding the existing taste peptide library. These results\nnot only validate TastePepAl's technical advantages in direct taste peptide\ndesign but also provide crucial molecular foundations and methodological\nreferences for developing next-generation peptide-based taste modulators."}, {"title": "2.5. Online deployment of open-access tools for taste peptide research", "content": "To promote open sharing and practical applications in taste peptide research,\nwe developed three interconnected yet functionally distinct platforms. First, we\nestablished TastePepMap (Figure 6A), a comprehensive taste peptide\ndatabase currently hosting over 1200 sequences with professional curation\nmechanisms for regular updates through continuous monitoring of global taste\npeptide research advances. TastePepMap supports multidimensional queries,\nenabling users to flexibly retrieve detailed peptide information through\nsequence or taste characteristic searches (Figure 6B).\nSecond, addressing the demands from both academic and industrial sectors\nfor taste peptide development, we launched the TastePepAl service platform\n(Figure 6C). This platform enables users to precisely define target taste\ncharacteristics and features to be avoided, offering two carefully designed\ntraining modes. 'Single Pattern Mode' focuses on precise training for specific\ntaste combinations (e.g., for sour-sweet peptide development, the model trains\nexclusively on dual-taste peptide data), enabling high-precision prediction of\ntarget features. In contrast, 'Multiple Pattern Mode' adopts a more inclusive\ntraining strategy (e.g., incorporating sour peptides, sweet peptides, and their\ncombinations for sour-sweet peptide development), providing richer training\nresources. This strategic design expands the model's exploration of sequence\nspace.\nFinally, recognizing that some users may require only peptide toxicity\nassessment, we separated SpepToxPred as a standalone tool from the"}, {"title": "3. Discussion", "content": "In this study, we developed TastePepAl, an automated computational platform\nthat achieves, for the first time, end-to-end automation in taste peptide design.\nThe platform innovatively integrates the core components the sequence\ngenerator LA-VAE and toxicity predictor SpepToxPred to establish a\ncomprehensive technical framework encompassing molecular design, cluster\nanalysis, safety assessment, and physicochemical property analysis. During\ndevelopment, our systematic analysis of existing taste peptide databases\nrevealed that approximately one-third of peptides possess multiple taste\ncharacteristics, with sequence similarities highly overlapping across different\ntaste categories. This complex molecular feature distribution underscores the\ninherent challenge in taste peptide design: neither traditional experimental\nscreening methods nor existing binary classification approaches can\neffectively explore such vast and intertwined sequence spaces.\nFor the sequence generation module, we designed LA-VAE with a loss\nsupervision mechanism through VAE architecture enhancement. To achieve\noptimal model performance, we introduced a dynamic loss monitoring strategy\nthat precisely tracks and preserves optimal solutions during training,\nsignificantly improving sequence generation stability and controllability. This\nstrategy demonstrates excellent data adaptability, automatically adjusting to\naccommodate dynamic changes in training data, thus providing technical\nassurance for rapid model deployment in complex data scenarios. Additionally,\nwe constructed a contrastive learning framework for taste characteristics in\nlantent space, enabling precise control of target taste features. This framework\nnot only enhances the expression intensity of desired tastes but also\neffectively suppresses undesired taste characteristics, reducing\ncross-interference effects in multi-taste peptide design.

The module achieved an MCC value\nexceeding 0.70 on independent test set, representing a 12% improvement\nover existing best models. More importantly, SpepToxPred's predictions\nprovided reliable safety guidance for subsequent experimental validation,\neffectively reducing the blindness and resource consumption in experimental\nscreening.\nExperimental validation results comprehensively demonstrated TastePepAl's\nsuperiority in multi-functional taste peptide design. The platform successfully\ndesigned 73 novel multi-taste peptides in a single attempt, with electronic\ntongue testing confirming their expected sweet, salty, and umami\ncharacteristics, while all samples showed no significant toxicity. This\nbreakthrough not only surpasses the total number of similar taste peptides\nreported in existing literature but also demonstrates the significant advantages\nof automated computational platforms in complex functional peptide\ndevelopment.\nSeveral directions warrant further exploration. First, taste peptide\ncharacterization exhibits strong environmental dependence and subjectivity,\nwhere minor changes in testing conditions may lead to perceptual\ndifferences60-62. This inherent uncertainty could affect training data annotation\nquality and consequently model learning outcomes, particularly in\ncomprehensive assessment of multiple taste features. Future research will\nbenefit from establishing more standardized taste evaluation systems and\nrefined data annotation mechanisms to enhance model reliability. Second,\nwhile current models primarily learn from sequence information, taste peptide\nfunctionality may be influenced by multiple factors including conformation and\nphysicochemical properties63,64.

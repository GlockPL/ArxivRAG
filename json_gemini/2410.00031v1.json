In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets.

As pricing decisions are increasingly placed in the hands of these agents, concerns have been raised regarding whether such agents may be susceptible to engaging in illegal or unethical business practices, often to the detriment of the consumer [1, 2]. This practice is referred to as algorithmic collusion.\nEarly work of both theoretical [3, 4] and empirical [5, 6] nature has demonstrated the risk of machines and algorithmic approaches engaging in unethical business practices, triggering an interest amongst regulatory bodies [2, 1]. Large language models (LLMs) offer general-purpose language generation capabilities, enabled by their pre-training on massive datasets [7]. Soon, businesses may begin feeding key business metrics into LLM-based pricing agents. Recent work has found that LLM-based agents are capable of autonomous collusion in an oligopolistic setting [8]. Furthermore, they find success in maximizing profits at the detriment of the consumer without explicit instruction or means of direct communication, suggesting a troublesome prognosis for consumer welfare in the future of AI pricing agents.\nIn this work, we examine the risk of collusion in a multi-commodity variant of Cournot models of competition. Whereas previous works in this area have focused on anti-competitive \"price fixing\", we"}, {"title": "Overview of Previous Work", "content": "O'Sullivan and Sheffrin [9] define collusion in multi-agent settings as an agreement, tacit or explicit, among firms or individuals to divide a market, set prices, limit production, or limit opportunities. We will adopt this definition for the remainder of this work, focusing specifically on market division. Research on AI-based pricing agents often examines their potential for collusion using various market scenarios. Take, for example, the Bertrand oligopoly, which uses a logit demand model to dictate the quantity of the product sold as a function of price[10, 8]. In this setting, agents produce a homogeneous product and set prices simultaneously, with the Nash equilibrium serving as a benchmark for empirical comparisons.\nAnother frequently studied model is Cournot competition, where agents choose production quantities as opposed to setting prices as in the Bertrand setting. In Cournot competition, an inverse demand model is calculated, where the price of a good is calculated based on the quantity of the good in the market (See Equation 1). Recent work explores multi-market Cournot settings where firms with symmetric cost functions decide which markets to enter under resource constraints [11, 12]. Auction-based models, particularly two-bidder first-price auctions, are also used to study collusion, with agents acting simultaneously over multiple rounds and known equilibrium outcomes [8, 13].\nIn several of the above problem settings, Q-learning agents have demonstrated collusive behavior, learning to charge supra-competitive prices in Bertrand competition games even without direct communication [10]. Collusion persists under imperfect monitoring, where agents lack access to others' prices [5]. Similar outcomes are observed in Cournot competition with policy gradient reinforcement learning [11]. In auctions, Q-learning agents collude only under specific conditions, such as asynchronous bidding in first-price auctions, but this behavior diminishes when bid history is introduced [13].\nCollusive behavior is not limited to Q-learning agents. Recent works explore the behavior of LLM-based agents in multi-agent market settings, and empirical experiments demonstrate that these agents can exhibit monopolistic pricing behavior even without explicit instructions to collude or channels to communicate with each other [8].\nThis work highlights collusion between LLM-based agents in the Cournot market setting. More specifically, we show that such agents effectively divide sales territories among each other and implicitly collude to discourage competition. This act of \"market division\" is considered illegal by various regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Trade Commission [14]."}, {"title": "Experiments and Results", "content": "In Cournot competition, each firm decides the quantity of a homogeneous, or indistinguishable, good to produce [15]. Using the aggregate quantity supplied to the market, the market-clearing price is determined through the inverse demand function. Previous works have identified Cournot-like competition in markets for commodities, such as crude oil [16] and coal [17], as well as wholesale electricity markets [18].\nWhile there has been significant work done in characterizing the original model and various derivatives, including but not limited to multi-market Cournot competition [19] and Cournot competition in networked markets [20], there has been limited work in understanding the model as a learning game and even less attention given to better understanding the risk of collusive game-play under such a model. Existing works exploring machine-learning methods in the context of Cournot competition have been limited exclusively to using traditional reinforcement learning (RL) techniques [11][21][22].\nIn this work, we present a novel application of LLM-based agents to a multi-commodity variant of the Cournot competition model. We use OpenAI's GPT-40 and GPT-3.5-turbo LLMs in our experiments [23]. The results displayed in Figure 2 are all obtained with GPT-40."}, {"title": "Problem Setting", "content": "We now present the general set-up of our multi-agent, multi-market Cournot game. Let there be n firms and m commodity markets, with $\\mathcal{F} = {f_1,..., f_n}$ and $\\Gamma = {\\gamma_1, ..., \\gamma_m }$ denoting the sets of firms and commodities, respectively. For the market of commodity $\\gamma_j$, let $q_{i,j}$ denote the quantity that firm $f_i$ produces. Then there exists a linear inverse demand function of the form\n$P(\\mathcal{Q}_j) = a_j - \\beta_j \\mathcal{Q}_j  \\text{ where } a_j, \\beta_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\text{ and } \\mathcal{Q}_j = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} q_{i,j}$\nFirm $f_i$ faces a marginal production cost $c_{i,j}$ to produce commodity j, drawn from the cost set $\\mathcal{C} = {c_1,...c_n}$, as well as a fixed total production capacity, $\\kappa_i$. We argue that differentiated production costs and limited production capacity are more representative of real-world inequities in the distribution of scarce resources, such as human capital and natural materials.\nWe run the market for a finite number of rounds, the total being unknown to firms. Every round, each firm $f_i \\in \\mathcal{F}$, facing the aforementioned constraints, chooses a strategy $s_i$ from its strategy space,\n$s_i \\in \\mathcal{S}_i = {(q_{i,1},..., q_{i,m}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m | \\Sigma_{j=1}^m q_{i,j} \\leq \\kappa_i }$\nAfter each round, we compute market-clearing prices for each good $\\gamma_j \\in \\Gamma$, $p(s)$ using the collective strategy profile for all firms, $s = (s_1, s_2,...,s_n) \\in \\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{S}_1 \\times \\mathcal{S}_2 \\times ... \\times \\mathcal{S}_n$, and the inverse demand function for commodity $\\gamma_j$. We then compute the profit of each firm according to the formula,\n$\\Pi_i^{f_i}(s) = \\Sigma_{j=1}^{m}(p(\\mathbf{s}) - c_{i,j}) \\cdot q_{i,j}$"}, {"title": "Quantifying Firm Specialization", "content": "To quantify the degree of specialization in a firm's production strategy across multiple markets, we employ the coefficient of variation (CV). For a firm i, we define its CV as:\n$CV_i = \\frac{\\sigma_i}{\\mu_i} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\Sigma_{j=1}^{m}(q_{i,j} - \\mu_i)^2}}{\\frac{1}{m} \\Sigma_{j=1}^{m} q_{i,j}}$\nwhere $q_{i,j}$ is the production quantity of firm i in market j, m is the number of markets, $\\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation, and $\\mu_i$ is the mean of firm i's production quantities.\nWe employ CV as a scale-independent measure of dispersion, facilitating meaningful comparisons between firms regardless of their absolute production levels [24]. A higher CV indicates greater specialization, reflecting more heterogeneous production allocation across markets, while a lower CV suggests a more diversified strategy. This approach builds upon established economic literature, where CV and related metrics have been utilized to assess firm diversification and market concentration [25, 26]."}, {"title": "Environment Configuration", "content": "For our experiments, we restrict ourselves to the case of n = 2 firms simultaneously competing in m = 2 commodity markets.

As a reference point, we solve for expected market outcomes under duopoloy and monopoly (full collusion), the formulations for which are presented in Appendix B.2.\nAgents are provided with historical market data including quantities sold, prices, market shares, and profits from the previous 30 rounds. The experiment prompts are intentionally vague. Each firm is"}, {"title": "Results and Observations", "content": "We run several experiments, sampling from the aforementioned cost set. The most notable results arise when there are asymmetric cost functions across each product, as in Figure 2. In this case, the agents exhibit clear and nearly immediate market division. Each firm allocates more resources to the product that has a cost advantage, even beyond what is expected at the Nash equilibrium, which already factors in cost advantages (see Appendix B.2 for more details on how this equilibrium was calculated). This specialization process is complete, as depicted by the CV reaching a value of 1 in Figure 3. Following the specialization, the agents succeed in dividing and controlling their respective markets. In 10 out of 10 runs, production allocation exceeds the Nash equilibrium quantity, and the CV is significantly higher than expected (See Appendix B.3 for statistical testing details).\nOur agents do not always fully exploit their market power. Monopolists typically limit supply to raise prices and maximize profits, as seen in Figure 7, but our agents sometimes over-produce, preventing optimal profit allocation (Figure 2). In 8 out of 10 runs, they settle on roughly an 80/5 allocation per product and rarely explore alternatives. However, when they do explore (as in Figure 7), we can see the potential threats that market division can pose to consumers. Increasing exploration by adjusting prompts to encourage this behavior could help agents better leverage their market control.\nWe also find that when both firms face symmetric cost functions for all products, they appear to converge and allocate production roughly evenly amongst themselves. This is as expected, considering a symmetric cost function would encourage the firms to approach a near-identical allocation strategy for profit maximization. In such situations, we note that the expected CV for the case of Nash equilibrium is zero, as production would be split evenly amongst products. The CVs obtained from the experiments in Figure 6, while on the lower side, remain significantly above the expected value of zero, reflecting that the firms do not converge to the true \"optimal\" strategy. Occasionally, even with symmetric cost functions, firms still approach monopolistic levels of total quantity supplied to the market (see Figure 5)."}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "content": "This research explores the potential for LLM-based agents to engage in anti-competitive behaviors, such as market division and monopolization, within a multi-commodity market setting. By simulating agents making strategic pricing and production decisions in multi-commodity Cournot competition models, our study highlights the risks of algorithmic collusion and the significant impact of AI-driven business decisions on markets, consumers, and communities.\nOur findings underscore the legal and ethical concerns associated with delegating high-impact business decisions to AI, particularly as agents can inadvertently engage in behavior that violates antitrust laws. Such emergent behaviors could also directly affect the livelihoods of employees and consumers (for example, if an agent's allocation strategy leads to the layoff of an entire business unit of a company, or if an allocation strategy limits access to a necessary good). It is imperative that firms and policymakers fully understand these risks before delegating such critical decisions to machines."}, {"title": "Broader Impacts", "content": "This work identifies a critical vulnerability in the deployment of LLM-based agents in an economic context, exposing the potential for these autonomous systems to engage in supra-competitive behavior and/or tend towards situations ripe for such behavior. Through our experiments, we demonstrate how LLM-based agents can engage in market division, resulting in a near-monopolistic division of commodities. In such a situation, two firms, A and B, each specialize in a single good to avoid competition (by specializing in a different good from the other firm). Market division of this nature can lead to consumer threats such as inflated pricing and the stifling of innovation.\nBy highlighting these tendencies, our study underscores the urgent need for increased scrutiny before deploying LLM-based agents in strategic, high-stakes decision-making roles within markets. We must understand the risks involved in the deployment of LLMs to such roles before we give agents the capability to make decisions like focusing on a singular product, laying off divisions of our companies, or inadvertently advising us to engage in anti-trust behaviors like market division.

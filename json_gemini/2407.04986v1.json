A primary contributing factor to these\nhealth issues is the lack of physical activity, underscoring the critical importance of\npromoting exercise and fitness [17]. Community parks play a pivotal role in encour-\naging physical activity by providing accessible spaces for individuals to participate in\nvarious recreational activities [18]. However, a significant challenge arises, as many\npark users remain uninformed about essential workout attributes, such as calories\nburned, average pace, and distance covered, which are crucial for monitoring and\noptimizing their exercise routines.\nConventional methods of tracking workout attributes often rely on wearable devic-\nes, such as the Apple Watch, Fitbit, and other fitness trackers [19, 20]. Despite offer-\ning valuable insights, these devices are associated with high costs and limited adop-\ntion rates owing to factors such as expense, inconvenience, and maintenance require-\nments. Consequently, a considerable proportion of park users remain unaware of their\nexercise-related data, hindering the effective management of fitness goals and the\npursuit of a healthy lifestyle.\nTo address this issue, we propose a deep learning integrated community park\n(DLICP) system as a cost-effective and user-friendly solution. The DLICP harnesses\nthe power of deep learning techniques, face recognition technology, and a novel walk-\ning activity measurement algorithm to offer personalized information regarding\nworkout attributes to park users.\nThe walking activity measurement algorithm calculates key parameters such as\ncalories burned, average pace, and distance covered, considering individual attributes\nsuch as body weight and average pace. This ensured accurate and tailored measure-\nments for each park user. In contrast to wearable devices, DLICP presents a more\ncost-effective alternative, with lower initial setup costs using cameras and software\ninfrastructure. Moreover, DLICP eliminates the need for users to wear additional\ndevices, thus providing a seamless and unobtrusive experience during park visits.\nCities such as Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore in India have state-owned parks\nwhere people of lower income come to exercise. The DLICP was created in the spe-\ncific context of providing a cost-effective solution to the challenge of lower-income\nindividuals accessing fitness attribute information. Instead of relying on costlier\nwatches and trackers, the DLICP ensures that individuals in these state-owned parks\nhave access to valuable insights about their workout attributes.\nThrough the DLICP, park users gain insights into their workout attributes, empow-\nering them to make informed decisions about their exercise routines, set realistic fit-\nness goals, and monitor their progress. By bridging the information gap and promot-\ning awareness about calories burned, average pace, and distance covered, the DLICP\naims to motivate park users to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a\nhealthier lifestyle.\nIn this paper, we presented the design, implementation, and evaluation of a DLICP\nsystem. Section 2 provides an overview of the related work in the field of exercise\ntracking and monitoring. Section 3 details the methodology and system architecture of\nthe DLICP. Section 4 discusses the experimental setup and evaluation results, demon-\nstrating the effectiveness of the DLICP as a cost-effective and user-friendly solution\nfor providing park users with valuable information about their workout attributes.\nFinally, Section 5 concludes the study and discusses potential future research direc-\ntions."}, {"title": "Literature Survey", "content": "This literature review constitutes a comprehensive analysis of nine esteemed academ-\nic papers covering various facets of wearable technologies in health and fitness moni-\ntoring.

These modules collaborate to\ntrack walking activities within a community park by considering the specific con-\nstraints and parameters. The exercise activity tracking module focuses on monitoring\nand recording walking activities within the park, accounting for the defined perimeter\nand designated pathway for completing a lap. This module tracks individuals' move-\nment along a pathway, capturing data related to their speed, distance covered, and\nduration of activity.\nSimultaneously, the Face Recognition Module played a vital role in ensuring the\nidentification and verification of individuals during walking sessions.\nFig. 1 visually depicts the workflow of DLICP, elucidating the sequential steps inher-\nent in the process.\nAs Shown in Fig. 1(a), before commencing their workout, park users are only re-\nquired to upload a photo of their face and provide basic details, such as their name\nand weight, to the DLICP system for seamless fitness tracking. As Shown in Fig.\n1(b), DLICP utilizes advanced facial recognition and employs unique calorie calcula-\ntion methods to enhance the accuracy of lap tracking and estimating calories burned,\nthereby providing users with a comprehensive and precise workout monitoring expe-\nrience. In Fig. 1(c), DLICP allows users to effectively monitor their fitness progress,\nvisualize workout data, and access stored information in the cloud, ensuring a conven-\nient and informed fitness journey. It utilizes a facial recognition framework (as ex-\nplained in subsection 3.1) to capture and analyze the faces of individuals participating\nin the activity. The module ensures that the subject's face is captured at least once\nduring every lap around the park, allowing for the accurate monitoring and tracking of\nindividual participation.\nBy combining the Exercise-Activity Tracking Module (as explained in Subsection\n3.2) and the Face Recognition Module, a comprehensive system was established for\ntracking and monitoring walking activities within the community park. The integra-\ntion of these modules ensures the synchronization of data on physical activity and individual identification, enabling a better analysis of individual performance, group\nstatistics, and the overall impact of walking activities within the community park."}, {"title": "Face Recognition Module", "content": "In the proposed face recognition module, advanced techniques such as Multi-task\nCascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) [10], are employed for initial face de-\ntection and localization. Once a face is detected, the region of interest (ROI) is ex-\ntracted by cropping the image. This ROI undergoes encoding or vectorization of facial\nfeatures using a VGG-16 model, with its classifier head removed [11]. The VGG-16\nmodel captures high-level features that represent the unique characteristics of the\nface.\nTo compare the generated face vectors with pre-existing encodings in the database,\nthe cosine similarity metric [21] was used to measure the angular similarity between\nface vectors. Setting a suitable threshold above which cosine similarity is considered\nsignificant allows the verification of the face as belonging to a specific person.\nIn addition to MTCNN, a model trained specifically for faces, we explored multi-\nple Generic Object Detection Models (YOLO), including YOLOv3, YOLOv5,\nYOLOv7, and YOLOv8. These models were trained with a diverse dataset of over\n100,000 human face images, encompassing different racial backgrounds and lighting\nconditions. Our evaluation involved assessing their performance in terms of inference\nspeed, average precision, and CPU memory usage.\nThe assessment (See Table 1) of inference speed and CPU memory usage was\nbased on the single-core processing of the GPU, utilizing the NVIDIA Maxwell archi-\ntecture with 128 NVIDIA CUDA\u00ae cores. In addition, the CPU features a quad-core\nARM Cortex-A57 MP Core processor, and the memory is 4 GB 64-bit LPDDR4,\noperating at 1600MHz with a bandwidth of 25.6 GB/s.\nOur analysis revealed that a specific version, YOLOv8, outperformed the other ver-\nsions by being the fastest with the least memory usage. This choice was necessitated\nby the need to address one of the constraints in real-time face detection and recogni-\ntion for the DLICP."}, {"title": "Exercise-Activity Tracking Module", "content": "The Exercise-Activity Tracking module is designed to monitor and track physical\nexercise, specifically focusing on calculating the calories burned during the activity.\nThis module uses a mathematical model to estimate calorie expenditure based on the\naverage pace achieved during exercise. The average pace as shown in Eq. (2), is\nmeasured and updated each time the individual completes a lap in the park, which is\ndetected through facial recognition by a camera.\nDistance Covered = Predefined Park Perimeter X Number of laps\n\\(Distance Covered = Predefined Park Perimeter X Number of laps\\) (1)\nAverage Pace =\n\\(Average Pace = \\frac{Distance Covered}{TimeElapsed}\\) (2)\nTimeElapsed\nThe calorie calculation process involves determining the Metabolic Equivalent of\nTask (MET) [12, 13] value based on the average pace achieved. According to the\ninformation in Table 2, MET values assigned to different walking activities depend on\nthe attained average pace.\nThese MET values serve as standardized indicators of energy expenditure associated\nwith different walking activities, facilitating comparisons and assessments of physical\nexertion across individuals and studies [14].\nThe calories burned per minute [15] were calculated using Eq. (3). The total calo-\nries burned as shown in Eq. (4) during the exercise session were then obtained by\nmultiplying the calories per minute by the elapsed time in minutes, considering the\nfractional part of an hour.\nCalories BurnedPerMinute =\n\\(Calories BurnedPerMinute = \\frac{MET X Subject Body Weight X3.5}{200}\\) (3)\n200\nTotal Calories Burned = Calories Burned Per Minute X Time Elapsed\n\\(Total Calories Burned = Calories Burned Per Minute X Time Elapsed\\) (4)\nThe utilization of these MET values, derived from Table 1, allows for an accurate\nestimation of the calories burned during different walking activities based on the av-\nerage pace achieved. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between average pace, body\nweights, and the corresponding calories burned per minute. This highlights how dif-\nferent combinations of average paces and body weights impact the rate of caloric\nexpenditure during physical activities.\nBy considering these variations in MET values, the exercise-activity tracking mod-\nule provides more precise and tailored calorie expenditure information for individuals\nengaged in various walking exercises."}, {"title": "Experiments and Results", "content": "In this section, we present the deployment of the proposed DLICP system at a com-\nmunity park in Porur, Chennai. The park features a closed one-path layout with a\nquadrilateral shape, offering a predefined perimeter of approximately 110 meters. To\nassess the effectiveness of the DLICP, we selected 22 subjects with diverse ages,\nbody weights, and fitness levels (see Fig. 4).\nOur experiments aimed to evaluate performance of DLICP and compare it with the\nindustry-standard Apple Watch Series 6. The first experiment focused on assessing\nthe DLICP alone, with subjects engaging in their typical walking routine within the\npark. The DLICP walking activity measurement algorithm accurately calculated pa-\nrameters such as calories burned, average pace, and distance covered by each subject.\nThe collected data offered insights into individual workout attributes and served as a\nbaseline for further analyses.\nIn the second experiment, we conducted a comparative analysis between DLICP and\nApple Watch Series 6. For this purpose, we set the Apple Watch to the \"Walking\nActivity\" mode within the fitness app. Both the DLICP and Apple Watch measured\nthe calories burned during the subjects' walking routines. By comparing the recorded\nvalues, we evaluated the relative accuracy of the DLICP compared to the industry-\nstandard Apple Watch."}, {"title": "Interpreting Experimental Data", "content": "The results of the experiments (see Table 3 and 4) demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDLICP in measuring the workout attributes.

(5) and Mean Percentage Error (MPE) as shown in Eq. (6).\nThe MAE value of 5.64 indicates an average absolute difference of 5.64 calories be-\ntween the DLICP and Apple Watch measurements. Similarly, the MPE value of\n1.96% signifies that, on average, the DLICP measurements deviate by 1.96% from the\nApple Watch measurements in terms of calorie estimation. These results demonstrate\nthat DLICP provides a reasonably accurate estimation of workout attributes with rela-\ntively low deviations from the measurements obtained by the Apple Watch.\nIn the evaluation of DLICP performance, certain subjects displayed a commenda-\nble alignment between the estimated and observed calorie expenditure. Notably, indi-\nviduals S3, S9, S11, and S15 exhibited relatively high Total Calories Burned, suggest-\ning the effectiveness of DLICP in capturing their diverse activity levels. However,\nchallenges arose when assessing subject S22, as DLICP yielded notably lower Total\nCalories Burned, suggesting potential limitations in accurately estimating calorie\nexpenditure for the specific individual. This discrepancy was attributed to his lower\naverage pace compared to that of the other subjects. This pattern extended to $18,\nS21, S4, and S14.\nUpon comparison with readings from the smartwatch, it was observed that the\nreadings were similar or closely aligned with minimal deviations. Hence, when the\naverage pace dramatically decreased, both the smartwatch and DLICP reflected a\nreduction in the calories burned at end of the activity.\nAnother intriguing observation pertains to the influence of Metabolic Equivalent of\nTask (MET) values in DLICP estimations, as evidenced by subject S9, possessing\nMET values of 11.5, resulting in notably higher Total Calories Burned. This is be-\ncause, from observation, Subject S9 engaged in high-paced running for the majority\nof the stipulated experimental time limit. This insight might help us understand the underlying truth: the more a subject engages in high-intensity running during the ex-\nercise, the more calories they will burn eventually at the end of the event.\nPronounced divergences emerged in S7, S8, and S20. In these cases, discrepancies\nof -5.02, -3.68, and -2.00, respectively, suggest potential intricacies or constraints in\nDLICP measurements. It is conceivable that factors dependent on the subjects' heart\nrate measurements and Apple Watch's proprietary algorithm could have contributed to\nthese variations.\nFactors such as the individual's body weight and average pace play a pivotal role in\ncalorie estimation, contributing to the differences between DLICP and the Apple\nWatch. The inherent variability in these parameters underscores the complexity of\naccurately gauging calorie expenditure during PA.\nMoreover, the distance calculated in the watch, which relies on accelerometer read-\nings and GPS, may not be entirely accurate. This can influence the proprietary algo-\nrithms in the watch, affecting the final calorie burned readings.\nIt's crucial to acknowledge that a universally acknowledged standard or state-of-\nthe-art (SOTA) method to definitively determine Calorie Burn is absent. The absence\nof a standardized benchmark emphasizes the need for continuous research and re-\nfinement to develop robust algorithms that can effectively account for the multifacet-\ned nature of individual physiological responses to varying activities.\nWhile DLICP demonstrates an overall alignment with Apple Watch estimates for\nmany subjects, the presence of both overestimation and underestimation underscores\nthe need for further investigation into the specific characteristics of subjects and activ-\nities contributing to these discrepancies.\nConsidering the tradeoffs between the two systems, the absence of heart rate meas-\nurements in DLICP may result in less accuracy. Relying on distance approximation\nusing accelerometers and GPS in the Apple Watch might introduce uncertainties in\ndetermining the precise average pace, thereby impacting the overall accuracy.\nNevertheless, exploring non-invasive techniques, such as microwave radars for\nheart BPM measurement, along with the existing DLICP architecture, presents an\nopportunity to enhance accuracy. By incorporating newer proportionality constants,\nwe can refine the existing mathematical model and improve the overall precision of\nthe calorie expenditure estimation. This suggests that DLICP might represent an ini-\ntial step towards providing reasonable results for non-invasive calorie expenditure\nestimations. However, the call for refined algorithms is paramount for enhancing the\naccuracy of these estimations. Continued research with diverse subjects and nuanced\nconsiderations for further algorithm development holds promise for advancing the\nprecision and reliability of such estimation methods in future research."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In conclusion, this study underscores the efficacy and precision of the DLICP algo-\nrithm for measuring workout attributes with notable accuracy.

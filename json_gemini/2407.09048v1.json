As the global maritime industry continues to expand, the adoption of intelligent maritime systems can op- timize route planning, monitor vessel conditions in real-time, and facilitate autonomous navigation (Sui et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021b). This evolution is driven by the need to reduce operational costs, comply with stricter environmental regulations, and improve the overall safety of maritime activities (Zhou et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023).\nHowever, despite the promising advancements, the field of intelligent maritime faces several critical challenges. One of the primary issues is the integration and processing of heterogeneous data from various sources, such as sensors, satellite communications, and weather forecasts (Liu et al., 2022d,c). This complexity often leads to fragmented and suboptimal decision-making processes. Additionally, the dynamic and unpredictable na- ture of maritime environments poses significant"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "General Large Models General large models have seen widespread development, encompass- ing areas such as language, vision, generation, and recommendation, providing efficient solutions for various complex tasks (Chang et al., 2023). Majumdar et al. present a modern formulation of Em- bodied Question Answering (EQA) as the task of understanding an environment well enough to an- swer questions about it in natural language (Majumdar et al., 2024). Yang et al. train a vision- language model (VLM) agent living in a visual world using an LLM agent excelling in a paral- lel text world (Yang et al., 2024b). The develop- ment of large models has also gradually expanded into the ocean domain.

The overall ar- chitecture of the KUNPENG model has six parts: The perception system senses and integrates heterogeneous data on vessel status, en- vironmental conditions, and historical navigation, which the cognition system uses to predict and correct oceanic meteorological states, understand the interactions between the environment and the ves- sel, and form brain-like cognition for multi-tasks in maritime. This provides a foundation for the decision-making system to make Theory of Mind (ToM) decisions, enabling intelligent vessels to ob- tain optimal strategies for autonomous berthing and unberthing, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. These strategies will serve as the basis for the dual- pathway fast-slow behavioral model in the behav- ior system, achieving embodied dynamic maritime behavior through feedback and optimization via imitation learning. The power system intelligently manages energy consumption and diagnoses faults during maritime behavior, ensuring collaborative optimization across systems. The safety and emer- gency system provides comprehensive risk assess- ments throughout the maritime process, ensuring safe and compliant navigation based on maritime regulations, and in case of anomalies, it determines responsibility based on maritime law to support intelligent emergency handling."}, {"title": "3.1 Workflow of the KUNPENG Model", "content": "The KUNPENG model integrates embodied ar- tificial intelligence and multimodal data fusion technologies, aimed at handling maritime demand queries and generating autonomous navigation in- structions for safe and compliant navigation of in- telligent vessels. The overall workflow of the KUN- PENG model is briefly presented as follows:\n\u2022 Step-1 Demand Input: Maritime operators input queries describing maritime tasks, in- cluding origin, destination, cargo type, and transport time.\n\u2022 Step-2 Data Encoding: Preprocessing of mar- itime demand queries includes tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic under- standing to accurately capture the intent of the maritime operators. At the same time, inte- grating sensor data of environmental status, satellite data, historical navigation data, ocean meteorological data, and Automatic Identifi- cation System (AIS) data of vessels status into vectors, capturing their semantic and feature information.\n\u2022 Step-3 Retrieval: The model retrieves rele- vant data from an established maritime knowl- edge base, including route planning, nautical charts, weather forecasts, and channel con- ditions. This information is crucial for au- tonomous vessel navigation and task execu- tion.\n\u2022 Step-4 Candidate Information Fusion:: The retrieved related vectors are fused with the query vectors. This process may involve the integration of multimodal information, com- bining features of text and image data to gen- erate a comprehensive representation.\n\u2022 Step-5 Generation: Leveraging the fused vectors, specific maritime instructions are gen- erated. These instructions encompass route planning, speed adjustments, navigational avoidance, target arrival times, etc., ensuring safe and efficient autonomous execution of maritime tasks by intelligent vessels.\n\u2022 Step-6 Instruction Output: Generated mar- itime instructions are output in machine- readable formats for consumption by au- tonomous systems onboard intelligent vessels.

Within the KUNPENG model, we introduce the embodied intelligent based on the brain-like dual-pathway model for perceiv- ing environmental dynamics like the human brain, understand and coordinate behaviors among multi- ple vessels, and the fast path ensures real-time dy- namic decision-making, and the slow path enables the accumulation of behavioral experience. Vessel ego-motion imitation learning is then proposed for constructing an integrated embodied meteorolog- ical navigation scheme. Finally, we propose the safety navigation rules and standards under intelli- gent maritime vessels for achieving compliant and safe navigation.\nThe KUNPENG model is developed as the first-ever embodied large model for intelligent maritime empowered by embodied intelligence to encom- pass the entire \"Perception-Cognition-Decision- Behavior\" process, ensuring the safe and compliant navigation of intelligent vessels in accordance with maritime law. Despite the significant potential of the embodied large model for intelligent maritime in enhancing the efficiency and safety of intelli- gent vessel navigation, the stability and reliability of the system under complex and extreme marine environments require further validation. Future development directions include optimizing algo- rithms and data processing techniques to improve the model's real-time performance and accuracy, enhancing the model's adaptability to different ma- rine environments and meteorological conditions, and advancing the integration of virtual simulations with physical verification to build a more compre- hensive and reliable intelligent maritime solution. These efforts will contribute to achieving a safer, more efficient, and intelligent global maritime net- work for smart ocean construction."}]}

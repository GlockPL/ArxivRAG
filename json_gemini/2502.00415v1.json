By processing financial news, historical stock prices, company fundamentals, and macroeconomic data, it aims to support multifaceted decision-making processes in modern financial markets. Since its initial inception [1], the framework has evolved in tandem with rapid advancements in LLM technology, introducing enhanced capabilities for data-driven investment strategies.\nThe motivation for developing MarketSenseAI arises from the limitations of existing systematic stock analysis approaches. Many methods rely on time-series modeling, sometimes supplemented by sentiment indicators, yet seldom integrate the broad scope of available data. A significant challenge also lies in handling data with varying sampling frequencies: macroeconomic indicators and fundamental factors typically follow lower-frequency release schedules than market data, requiring sophisticated integration methods to ensure consistency.\nAlthough AI-based solutions employing machine learning or deep learning provide systematic frameworks for stock prediction [2-4], they often focus on isolated data types (e.g., sentiment or historical returns) without leveraging the wealth of relevant financial texts as well as the context of those texts. Consequently, investment strategies frequently emphasize price trends, fundamental ratios, or macroeconomic variables in isolation, overlooking the collective dependencies among these factors [5, 6]. Unlike traditional quantitative models that operate as black boxes, MarketSenseAI supplies detailed explanations for its investment decisions, thereby enhancing transparency and user trust [7].\nEven approaches that incorporate textual data (e.g., news or earnings call transcripts) tend to center on predicting sentiment indicators rather than conducting in-depth qualitative analysis [8, 9]. This fragmentation is further compounded by limited human resources for processing heterogeneous financial information at scale. In this context, integrating structured financial data with unstructured financial information becomes a challenge one that MarketSenseAI seeks to address.\nHowever, the successful application of LLMs in finance also poses notable challenges. First, even state of the art LLMs have constraints on context window size, limiting their ability to process large documents such as 10-K filings or detailed macroeconomic reports [10, 11]. Second, model outputs can be sensitive to prompt engineering choices and broader design decisions, complicating issues such as back- testing and replicability [12]. Third, consistently interpreting and accurately han- dling-quantitative metrics like risk measures and financial ratios can be difficult due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs [13, 14]. Additionally, ensuring models remain current with newly released data is non-trivial, particularly as most pre-trained LLMs have fixed cut-off dates [15].\nIn response to these challenges, the contributions of this paper focus on demonstrating how recent advances in LLM architectures can strengthen fundamental and macroeconomic analyses within the MarketSenseAI framework:\n1 MarketSense AI is available at https://www.marketsense-ai.com/"}, {"title": "1.

Similarly, TradingGPT [20] adopts a multi-agent, layered memory architecture for col- laborative decision-making\u2014though its evaluation results are limited. Meanwhile, [21] apply sentiment analysis, model ensembles, and in-context learning to predict returns in the Chinese equity market, achieving promising accuracy.

This approach is particularly valuable for finance, where multi-faceted data-regulatory filings, market news, economic reports can be vast and continually updated. Recent research focuses on advanced chunking, query expansion, and re-ranking algorithms to mitigate context loss when processing large documents [25, 26], though optimal methodologies may vary depending on data size, structure, and recency requirements. For instance, in stock analysis, the date-aware document retrieval becomes essential yet is often overlooked in standard similarity searches. Although a few recent works propose RAG pipelines tailored to financial tasks [27, 28], there remains a gap in comprehensive, domain-specific solutions optimized for financial analytics."}, {"title": "2.4 Importance of Filings and Earnings Calls in Fundamental Research", "content": "A substantial body of empirical evidence underscores the critical role of SEC filings (e.g., 10-K and 10-Q) and earnings conference calls in shaping market outcomes and guiding investment decisions. Studies by [29, 30] report that changes in language complexity, disclosure content, and tonal shifts within filings predict returns, risk profiles, and management quality. [31, 32] emphasize the importance of footnote analysis for identifying hidden risks, while [33] demonstrate how readability and clarity can serve as proxies for managerial competence and earnings transparency.\nEarnings conference calls exert a similarly influential role in price discovery. [34] find that trading volumes and volatility spike during these events, especially in Q&A sessions where spontaneous managerial insights can move markets. [35] show that the"}, {"title": "2.5 Macroeconomic environment impact in stock analysis", "content": "While fundamental metrics and firm-specific disclosures remain critical, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation rates, interest rates), central bank policies, geopolitical factors, and trade agreements between nations provide a broader context that can significantly influence investment outcomes [43]. Fluctuations in these external conditions can affect corporate earnings, valuation models, and overall market sentiment-ultimately impacting both short- and long-term trading strategies.\nExpert analysis from leading financial institutions plays a crucial role in interpreting these complex macroeconomic relationships. Research and opinionated reports from investment banks and central banks provide valuable insights into emerging trends, policy implications, and potential market impacts that may not be immediately apparent in quantitative data alone [44]. These expert opinions are particularly valuable when analyzing interconnected global markets where local expertise and institutional knowledge become essential for understanding market dynamics.\nIncorporating macro-level context and expert insights alongside firm-level data can lead to more robust and adaptive models, particularly when combined with LLM-based frameworks capable of integrating multiple data streams. Notably, macroeconomic forces often vary in their impact across different stocks and sectors. For example, US tariffs on imported goods from China can weigh heavily on industries reliant on specific commodities or products [45]. However, many existing quantitative and LLM-based stock-analysis models typically overlook these broader economic factors and expert interpretations, revealing a gap in current approaches to investment research."}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": "3.1 Overview of MarketSenseAI components\nThe MarketSenseAI framework, detailed in [1], is designed as a modular system that synthesizes various types of financial information from daily news and corporate fundamentals to market dynamics and macroeconomic data-to generate actionable investment signals.

Fundamentals Agent", "content": "Focuses on analyzing each company's financial statements (e.g., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow reports). To handle large and often complex numerical data, these statements are preprocessed and reduced into abbreviated formats (e.g., grouping figures in \"million\" or \"billion\") before the LLM extracts key insights. The system compares recent quarters to highlight shifts in profitability, revenue, or leverage ratios, laying the groundwork for fundamental analysis. Besides the numerical figures, the updated"}, {"title": "3. Dynamics Agent", "content": "Examines historical price movements and contextualizes them against industry peers and the broader market (i.e., S&P 500). By incorporating risk metrics like volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and maximum drawdown statistics, this component provides a risk-adjusted lens on how the target stock performs relative to both its closest competitors and the general market."}, {"title": "4. Macroeconomic Agent", "content": "Collates and synthesizes key macro-level reports, including investment bank outlooks, central bank announcements, and broader geopolitical or sector-specific research. The generated summary distills multiple sources into a concise snapshot of prevailing economic conditions (e.g., interest rate policies, inflation trends, and global demand shifts). The resulting macro-level insight helps the system account for external forces that may affect individual stocks or entire sectors."}, {"title": "5. Signal Agent", "content": "The final component integrates the textual outputs from the previous four modules news, fundamentals, price dynamics, and macroeconomic outlook into a single decision-making process. Implemented via a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy, the LLM reviews each aggregated summary to produce an investment signal (buy, hold, or sell). It also provides a written explanation that traces the reasoning behind each recommendation, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability."}, {"title": "3.2 Enhanced fundamentals analysis", "content": "The Fundamentals Agent in MarketSenseAI has been significantly enhanced to go beyond the numerical analysis of financial statements by incorporating three sequential LLM processes (Fig. 2). While the previous version focused primarily on extracting trends and ratios from standard reports (e.g., balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements), the updated agent now processes disclosures, footnotes, and strategic insights found in 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings. Moreover, it accounts for the qualitative dimension of earnings call transcripts, including their Q&A sessions. These"}, {"title": "3.2.1 A Three-Layer Approach to Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Data", "content": "To generate a holistic fundamental summary for a given company, the agent orchestrates three primary LLM processes:\n1. Filing Summary: Textual information from SEC filings is summarized with particular emphasis on disclosures, risk factors, and strategic initiatives. These elements help explain the reasons behind fluctuations or significant changes in key financial metrics.\n2. Earnings Call Summary: Earnings call transcripts are processed separately to extract management's qualitative signals, such as sentiment, confidence, and forward-looking statements. This phase focuses on the executive team's tone, discussions on partnerships or product launches, and any macro-level considerations that may influence long-term performance."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Evaluating the Impact of SEC Filings and Earnings Calls", "content": "To assess how SEC filings and earnings call data affect the Fundamentals Agent's outputs, we conducted a sentiment analysis on 1,500 generated summaries covering S&P500 stocks at three different points in time. The FinBERT model was utilized to obtain the sentiment of each generated summary [46]. Tablel and Fig. 3 reveal distinct patterns between outputs with and without this additional text-based information. When incorporating filings and calls data, the analysis showed a slightly less positive average sentiment (Mean = 0.31) with more moderate variance (Std Dev = 0.28). In contrast, analyses based on numerical data alone exhibited more positively skewed results (Mean = 0.36) with a wider spread of sentiment values (Std Dev = 0.40). This moderation in sentiment when including filings data is particularly noteworthy as SEC filings require companies to disclosure risks and uncertainties in dedicated sections, even when their financial metrics appear strong, thus providing a more balanced perspective of the company's outlook.\nAlthough the two setups differ in their sentiment distributions, the variability in scores underscores how qualitative insights can moderate an otherwise upbeat narrative based solely on numerical trends. Notably, the mean difference of 0.24 and a maximum difference of 0.96 suggest that incorporating the text from filings and calls can reveal otherwise unrecognized risks or strategic realignments."}, {"title": "3.3 Macroeconomic Analysis Improvements", "content": "The Macroeconomic Agent, which functions as an economist within MarketSenseAI, has been enhanced to process a broader range of institutional reports through a robust data-ingestion and generation pipeline (Fig. 5 and 6). These updates address known limitations of LLMs such as constrained context windows, the tendency to generate hallucinations, and oversimplification-by systematically incorporating diverse macroeconomic data from authoritative sources. As a result, the Macroeconomic Agent can provide more comprehensive and context-rich analysis on factors that influence stock performance."}, {"title": "3.3.1 Data Injection", "content": "The data injection stage (Fig. 5) is designed to efficiently collect, process, and store macroeconomic reports from multiple sources, including central banks (e.g., Federal Reserve, European Central Bank), statistical bureaus, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and opinionated expert briefings from global investment banks such as JPMorgan and BlackRock. We have implemented institution-specific parsing scripts that handle the unique formatting and structure of reports from each source, ensuring consistent and accurate data extraction across different providers."}, {"title": "Metadata Extraction and Filtering", "content": "Once a document is parsed, we identify key attributes like publication date, publisher, and URL.

By addressing critical challenges such as context window limitations, data frequency mismatches, and the integration of qualitative and quantitative information, the framework introduced a Chain-of-Agents approach for granular fundamental analysis and a RAG module enhanced with HyDE for macroeconomic context. These advancements enable deeper, more comprehensive analysis of SEC filings, earnings calls, and expert reports, which traditional models often overlook.\nEmpirical evaluations on S&P 100 (2023-2024) and S&P 500 (2024) stocks validate MarketSense AI's efficacy. While the S&P 500 analysis was limited to 2024 due to data availability, the system's ability to scale to a larger universe (500 stocks) while improving performance underscores its robust stock-picking capabilities. The framework generated significantly higher cumulative returns and consistent alpha, outperforming competitive benchmarks across risk-adjusted metrics. Factor analysis revealed that returns stem not only from exposure to value and momentum factors but also from unique alpha sources, likely attributable to the framework's versatile data integration and analysis.\nFuture development will focus on two key directions: technological advancement through integration of reasoning-enabled LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's O1) and market expansion to global and small-cap indices. These enhancements aim to further improve the system's analytical capabilities while testing its adaptability across diverse market conditions.\nMarketSense AI represents a significant step forward in applying LLMs to financial analysis, offering both institutional and retail investors a transparent, data-driven approach to investment decision-making. By successfully addressing fundamental challenges such as processing lengthy documents, mitigating hallucination risks, and integrating multiple data sources, this work establishes a foundation for building more sophisticated, explainable investment frameworks."}]}

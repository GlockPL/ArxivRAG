{"title": "Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep\nLearning-based Machine Condition Diagnosis", "authors": ["Eduardo Jr Piedad", "Christian Ainsley Del Rosario", "Eduardo Prieto-Araujo", "Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt"], "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) strategies have recently been\nutilized to diagnose motor faults by simply analyzing motor\nphase current signals, offering a less costly and non-intrusive\nalternative to vibration sensors. This research transforms these\ntime-series current signals into time-frequency 2D represen-\ntations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor\ncurrent signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories:\none representing normal conditions and four representing arti-\nficially induced faults, each under five different load conditions:\n0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based\ntechniques-WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and\nWSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Con-\nvolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed\nand tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The\nDL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed\nremarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93,\n89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-\nbased methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and\n82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation\nprotocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the\nformerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy.\nHowever, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing\ntechniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults.\nThe performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers\na compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.", "sections": [{"title": "I.

In contrast, the other three models converged\nearly, as shown in their respective training and validation\naccuracy and loss functions in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.\nIt seems that the CNN architecture works well with non-\nsynchrosqueezed WT methods. The performances of the two\nsynchrosqueezed-based WT methods in the 10-fold stratified\ncross-validation stage showed inconsistency and huge vari-\nations, as shown in Fig. 5.

CONCLUSION", "content": "Applying Wavelet Transform (WT) to convert time-series\nmotor current signals into time-frequency 2D plots has effec-\ntively uncovered underlying features essential for predicting\nmotor faults. The study tested five different WT-based transfor-\nmation methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\na deep learning architecture. The WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and\nWT-Morse methods demonstrated significant effectiveness,\nshowing superior performance compared to previous 2D-\nimage-based techniques. The WT-Morse model surpassed prior\nmethodologies and marginally outperformed the previous best\nmodel. However, the two synchrosqueezed-WT models faced\nsubstantial inconsistencies and difficulties, suggesting that the\n\"synchrosqueezing\" process might have overly manipulated\nthe WT plots, potentially obscuring critical patterns necessary\nfor the deep learning of CNNs. These findings show the\npotential of wavelet-based 2D transformations for intelligent\nmotor fault diagnosis."}]}

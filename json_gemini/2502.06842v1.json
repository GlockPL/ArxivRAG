Miller", "Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas"], "abstract": "Healthcare systems are struggling to meet the growing demand for neurological care, with challenges particularly acute in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). While artificial intelligence research has often focused on identifying patterns beyond human perception, implementing such predictive capabilities remains challenging as clinicians cannot readily verify insights they cannot themselves detect. We propose that large language models (LLMs) offer more immediately practical applications by enhancing clinicians' capabilities in three critical areas: comprehensive data collection, interpretation of complex clinical information, and timely application of relevant medical knowledge. These challenges stem from limited time for proper diagnosis, growing data complexity, and an overwhelming volume of medical literature that exceeds any clinician's capacity to fully master. We present a framework for responsible Al integration that leverages LLMs' ability to communicate effectively with both patients and providers while maintaining human oversight. This approach prioritizes standardized, high-quality data collection to enable a system that learns from every patient encounter while incorporating the latest clinical evidence, continuously improving care delivery. We begin to address implementation challenges and initiate important discussions around ethical considerations and governance needs.

Further, providers must be aware of the most up-to-date evidence to create an optimal management plan. Ideally, they need to be aware of the appropriate research studies to offer to their patients enabling new discoveries in neurology.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, particularly through generative Al built on large language models (LLMs)4. In this article, we review how these advancements have now reached a stage where Al can effectively assist in the diagnosis and care of neurodegenerative diseases. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that advanced generative Al systems encode clinical knowledge,5 can achieve expert-level medical question answering, integrate multimodal patient data, are capable of empathetic history taking through conversational agents,8-11 and enhance clinical decision-making.12 While much research has focused on Al's potential to identify patterns beyond those available to ordinary human perception (often called predictive Al), the clinical implementation of such predictive capabilities remains challenging, at least in part because clinicians cannot readily verify insights they cannot themselves detect. However, LLMs offer more immediately practical applications as they can enhance clinicians' capabilities by supporting three critical areas where healthcare providers increasingly struggle: comprehensive data collection, interpretation of increasingly complex clinical information, and timely application of relevant medical knowledge to specific data sets. These challenges stem from limited time to collect sufficient data to allow proper diagnosis, exponentially growing data complexity, and an overwhelming volume of medical literature that exceeds any individual clinician's capacity to fully master and apply at the point of care. Furthermore, LLMs' ability to both communicate effectively with patients and providers and learn from interactions creates an unprecedented opportunity for a continuously learning healthcare system. Such a system could leverage every patient encounter to enhance its knowledge base, while simultaneously incorporating the latest clinical evidence, creating a self-improving framework for care delivery that becomes increasingly more effective over time.\nStill, such a learning system needs to be intentionally molded to ensure the data collection and interpretation is beneficial to and inclusive of a diverse group of patients, that it helps both patients and providers without imposing new burdens, and that it can be readily implemented in any clinic setting regardless of the available resources. This will require rigorously evaluating efficacy in the research setting and effectiveness in the clinic setting. Once implemented, continuous monitoring using clinically meaningful outcomes will be needed to optimize data collection processes, prevent model drift, and quickly identify any unintended negative consequences of this diagnostic system.\nIn this article, we provide a roadmap of how we see how a responsible Al integration can be accomplished in the field of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Further, we hope that this framework can be useful for anyone in the field of neurology or other specialties, encouraging exploration into how Al may aid their patients and fellow providers."}, {"title": "A crisis in the field of ADRD", "content": "As the U.S. population ages, the number of people with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) that manifest as dementia is rapidly increasing,13,14 with lifetime dementia risk reaching 48% for women and 35% for men after age 55, and US cases projected to double by 2060 to 1 million annually. 15 Total annual payments for health care and long-term care for people with ADRD are projected to increase to $1 trillion a year by 205016. Early detection and precise diagnosis are crucial for proper access to quality care, eligibility for new and emerging disease modifying therapies. In turn, this can enable research to advance the field. Unfortunately, more than 50% of dementia diagnoses are delayed until moderate or advanced stages in primary care 17,18 with greater delays among racial and ethnic minorities.19 Worse, misdiagnosis rates for AD and non-AD dementias is high, diminishing the likelihood that a patient will receive appropriate care.\nEarly detection enables identification of reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction, facilitates safety and advanced care planning;20\u201322 and allows referral to dementia care navigation programs that improve quality of life for the person with dementia and care partners while reducing healthcare expenditures23\u201326. Furthermore, recent FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's Disease and other NDDs27\u201329 are most effective early in the disease course30,31 and do not work in more advanced stages of illness. Finally, early detection is essential for identifying candidates for clinical trials32,33, and therefore, essential for finding effective future therapies.\nThere are many challenges with diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. Most primary care providers cite lack of time and confidence,34,35 preferring to refer patients to specialists, but the demand for dementia specialists exceeds the available supply with the gap continuing to widen. 1,36,37 Further, many neurologists, psychiatrists and geriatricians are loath to take on difficult dementia cases and look to dementia specialty centers to care for these patients. The average wait times for specialists are expected to exceed 40 months by 2027, with rural areas facing three times longer delays compared to urban regions. 38 Diagnosis requires difficult collection and combing through time-consuming data as well as interpretation of this data..\nAfter diagnosis, challenges with management are growing as new therapeutics with intensive monitoring regimens are emerging.30,31 Many primary care providers and general neurologists struggle to keep pace with the rapid advancements in the field, which includes maintaining awareness of research studies that could potentially benefit their patients and the ADRD field. Furthermore, new care models such as those proposed by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)24 demand additional resources that our current workforce is ill-equipped to support."}, {"title": "High Quality Data Collection", "content": "Data collection is the essential first step toward a timely diagnosis, enabling both personalized management plans and meaningful research contributions. Standardized, high-quality, multimodal data collection not only facilitates efficient storage and sharing, but also underpins the continuous development of effective Al systems. For example, in neuroimaging, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) provides a standardized framework for organizing and describing MRI data.39 Similar data formats exist for genetics (VCF, HGVS), 40 and certain biomarker fields (MIAME, MIAPE),41,42 however many other modalities\u2014such as neuropsychological assessment and the measurement of connected speech\u2014lack widely adopted standards for data organization and annotation. The absence of standardized frameworks in these areas presents challenges for reproducibility, sharing, and integration of multimodal datasets across research centers.\nThe methods of collection must be easy for patients and their caregivers, while increasing their access to care, and avoiding extra effort from providers. There is an opportunity for these standards to be established and revised by a team of experts, then implemented and monitored in both the research and clinical settings. This is a key step for an effective system given that the quality of the Al model is dependent on the quality of the data it learns from. A national organization such as the NIH could potentially facilitate such an effort, though there are many other potential models, several of which have been considered for Al governance.43\nData collection should first prioritize what clinicians can interpret and are currently using to diagnose neurodegenerative disease in both the clinic and research settings, including the patient's history, physical examination, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and biomarkers. We acknowledge that passively collected, objective data from wearables, sensors, and electronic health records (EHRs) hold great promise and may soon be included in this data"}, {"title": "Overview", "content": "collection towards the goal of diagnosis. Regarding past healthcare, Al can aid in parsing photos of past records and notes, as well as synthesizing EHR data across various specialties to extract relevant historical indicators or generate targeted questions for assessment.\nParticularly with new multimodal Al capabilities, 44 passive data will be able to assist with early detection and data interpretation.45,46 For example, emerging research shows that passive data collection through digital biomarkers\u2014including continuous monitoring of sleep patterns, speech, typing output, and gait\u2014can detect subtle behavioral changes months to years before symptoms become noticeable to individuals or their caregivers.47 However, this passively collected data is still used predominantly in the research phase, not in the clinic setting,48,49 and therefore is not discussed further in this paper."}, {"title": "Gathering the patient's history", "content": "We currently rely on the patient and/or caregiver noticing their symptoms and then relaying them to a provider in a way that triggers a pathway to further evaluation. While patients and caregivers are most likely to discuss this with their primary care provider (PCP) first, it is becoming more common to turn to the internet and engage with platforms online which could allow earlier identification of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it will be important to develop tools that can capture symptoms from a patient as early as possible in either the healthcare setting or at home. These tools will need to be adapted to the setting of a Medicare annual wellness visit and use brief screening questions to identify cognitive concerns 11. If high risk based on these answers, a more comprehensive assessment must be available.\nTo overcome barriers with writing and typing, particularly for elderly patients at greater risk for cognitive impairment, patients need to be able to speak with the tool as they would with an empathetic physician such as in the form of a conversational agent. Conversational agents have shown promise with collecting patient histories but most have been limited to text based interactions of relatively limited duration, and the few recent explorations of using LLMs in conversational agents have been used with low stakes patient scenarios with no intention to assist with diagnosis. 8,9,50\u201353 LLM's have demonstrated the ability to power conversational agents to interact with patients effectively, and in some cases, in a manner that is more efficient and more empathetic than a physician10. More recently voice based conversational agents have advanced so that they can hold a fluid, human-like conversation.11 With LLM's ability to adjust explanations to a patient's education level as well as speak in most patients' preferred languages, 54 there is the potential to reduce disparities with such a tool. Still, significant work is needed to realize this benefit as a recent study revealed these tools can have worse performance with non-English speaking people.55\nThe constraints of brief office visits present significant challenges in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases. Physicians, faced with limited time, may struggle to gather and document comprehensive patient histories from distressed patients or caregivers. This limitation often leads to redundant interviews as patients consult multiple specialists, potentially delaying diagnosis. Moreover, the resulting incomplete documentation not only impacts direct patient care but also restricts the valuable clinical data available for Al-driven diagnostic support systems. Assuming unconstrained time, a conversational agent based on an LLM specialized for cognitive decline could collect and document the type of comprehensive history only obtained in highly specialized settings. Asking targeted questions is particularly crucial since the subtle distinctions in symptom presentation and progression can help differentiate between neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., syndromes most compatible with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, or Lewy Body disease). Also, voice based conversational agents could be deployed over the phone, increasing healthcare access for patients who are of lower socioeconomic status, have limited English proficiency, as well as for people who are frail and elderly.56\u201359 Moreover, given its remote deployment capabilities, such a conversational agent could be integrated at various points along the patient's care pathway. For instance, when schedulers document a chief complaint related to cognitive difficulties, or when medical assistants conduct pre-visit outreach, they could connect patients with the appropriate conversational agent to gather preliminary diagnostic information before the clinical encounter. This would help optimize the limited time available during physician visits while maintaining the diagnostic focus of the collected information.\nAn LLM can also assist in summarizing the collected history in a way that allows a provider to easily review the symptoms and identify patterns of concern, such as a History of Present Illness (HPI) or an outline broken down into symptom domains. Furthermore, the LLM can summarize relevant past history and symptoms from prior medical visits or interactions with other healthcare providers. Together, patient history and voice data could then be interpreted by an Al model for decision support as well. The history taking, documentation of the HPI in a note, and decision support would ease physician burden, making adoption more likely.\nRegardless of a conversational agent collecting this history, healthcare institutions are widely adopting ambient Al scribes that can automatically transcribe and summarize patient encounters in real-time, representing the first steps toward this vision of comprehensive Al assistance in clinical documentation which can provide the history needed for enhanced decision support tools in the future.60 The history alone, if keyed to earliest symptoms, pace of progression and level of disability, can effectively differentiate many neurodegenerative conditions. However, ambient scribes will still be insufficient alone as, in most office practices, we never learn how a person's illness began (e.g., with memory loss, REM behavior disorder or disinhibition)."}, {"title": "Neuropsychological Testing", "content": "When concerning symptoms are identified, a cognitive assessment looking for objective measures of cognitive impairment is required. Cognitive assessment tools should be scalable and designed to identify relative weaknesses of specific cognitive and behavioral domains to enable identification of patterns helpful with diagnosis. Ideally, they should be administered without the need for a highly trained assessor (both to address scalability and access as well as reduce variability/reliability of results based on skill of the assessor).\nCurrently, there are challenges that both hinder the administration of cognitive assessments as well as the collection of the results in a manner that can be easily available for Al interpretation. Assessments are time-consuming for physicians to administer, require specific training even for the most common assessments (e.g., MMSE, MoCA), and tend to be less accurate in medically underserved minorities.19,59,61 In the past, when an assessment was documented, the final score was written into the note without specifying affected cognitive domains. This type of analysis will benefit from Al interpretation.\nFortunately, there are several validated cognitive assessment tools that are now available for use in the clinic setting and some at home as well that address the challenges above.62,63 Some of these tools have demonstrated great potential to scale, and research into their implementation across various PCP settings is underway. At UCSF for example, the TabCAT Brain Health Assessment (TabCAT-BHA) is an iPad-based assessment administered by medical assistants with very little training and has had organic adoption across several UCSF affiliated PCP clinics.64,65 In one study, the BHA had 100% sensitivity to dementia and 84% to MCI while the MoCA had 75% sensitivity to dementia and 25% to MCI. The BHA had 83% sensitivity to MCI likely due to AD and 88% to MCI unlikely due to AD, and the MoCA had 58% sensitivity to MCI likely AD and 24% to MCI unlikely AD.66 The landscape of digital cognitive assessments continues to evolve, with emerging tools increasingly incorporating Al with the goal to enhance their capabilities.67\nOnce the history and cognitive assessment is captured, Al systems could present the PCP with a differential diagnosis with explanations and then provide recommendations for next steps in workup and management based on the latest evidence-based guidelines. This would most often entail reversible dementia labs and neuroimaging and identify patients who require more urgent evaluation by a specialist, such as those with a rapidly progressive dementias or eligibility for disease modifying therapy. The physician could receive this information at the beginning of the appointment, verify relevant symptoms with the patient, and then help the patient and/or their caregiver understand the results and next steps at this initial visit. Note that gathering the history and cognitive assessment ahead of the visit could free up time with the physician, enabling a conversation designed to build rapport and share decision making that a physician would not otherwise have the time to do well. Al could also assist with providing an explanation that is both empathetic and optimizes the patient's understanding.68"}, {"title": "Physical examination", "content": "For the time being, the patient's physical examination is still important in obtaining a diagnosis and the motor findings associated with Lewy body disease, corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many other conditions. In addition, the absence of motor findings in AD is also important. While an in-person physical exam is ideal, physical exam findings for these syndromes can often be uncovered through video visits which can increase accessibility for patients who cannot feasibly travel to see a specialist. Possibilities include video interpretation of speech and speech patterns, motor planning and execution, gait, balance, and others. New multimodal Al models have made significant progress in describing video content such as surgeries, making video data a promising method for Al decision support with further research.69"}, {"title": "Neuroimaging data", "content": "MRI neuroimaging has become more accessible around the country, and creative solutions, including mobile MRI scanners, are showing great promise to make it even more accessible.70\u201372 Therefore, relative to other data needed for diagnosis, recently MRI scans have not been the major bottleneck. Still, the diagnostic utility of MRI scans is often overlooked with traditional reports, and incorporating Al interpretation of MRI atrophy patterns as part of an Al diagnostic tool will be of great value to any clinician."}, {"title": "Biomarker data", "content": "Biomarkers are now a valuable component of the diagnostic process. While amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers are not easily scalable or accessible, multiple promising plasma-based biomarkers are becoming available in the clinic setting to detect Alzheimer's disease.73\u201375 The implementation and real world accuracy of these biomarkers is highly promising.75 We do not anticipate this structured data to be a significant challenge for an Al model to interpret. It should be noted however, that interpretation of these biomarkers still requires clinical context to accurately interpret, meaning at a minimum a comprehensive patient history, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging.76,77"}, {"title": "Concluding Remarks for Data Collection: Laying the Foundation for Al Assistance", "content": "In conclusion, standardized, comprehensive, and high-quality data collection across various healthcare systems is fundamental to the successful integration of Al in the diagnosis and management of ADRD. It not only enhances the immediate diagnostic capabilities of Al models but also sets the stage for continuous learning and improvement, which will be crucial in adjusting what data is needed as other diagnostic studies become more accurate and scalable (e.g., a more efficient history may be possible in the context of a very accurate, positive blood-based biomarker showing Alzheimer's disease). Therefore, it is imperative to focus on creating a robust infrastructure across multiple institutions for data collection, ensuring inclusivity, and establishing a continuous feedback loop to refine how and what data is being collected. By doing so, we can realize the full potential of Al in helping us to interpret patient data and serving as a valuable decision support tool."}, {"title": "Al Decision Support: Data Interpretation to Facilitate Diagnosis and Management", "content": "Achieving the goals of high-quality data collection outlined above will enable both the physician and the Al model to more easily access, integrate, and interpret multimodal patient data, avoiding the risk of false positives that come with relying on one test result. 7,78 Al can augment clinician capabilities by highlighting important diagnostic features from this complex multimodal data, explaining how it arrived at a diagnosis or management suggestion.6,12,79 This integration allows for a human-in-the-loop, which can help a clinician identify when Al is making errors. In this way, Al can be a collaborative partner, rather than a passive tool."}, {"title": "Brief Overview of Al Research in ADRD Decision Support", "content": "In the field of ADRD, traditional machine learning paradigms have considerable utility in analyzing unified data modalities, including biomarkers,80 genetic information (including emerging polygenic risk scores), 81 neuroimaging,82 and connected speech.83 These conventional methodologies, encompassing logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, can delineate disease-specific patterns.84 Notably, logistic regression models are finding widespread research application in binary classification scenarios, particularly in distinguishing between healthy controls and individuals with Alzheimer's disease.82 Support vector machines have demonstrated particular efficacy in identifying imaging biomarkers associated with frontotemporal dementia. 85 However, these approaches frequently encounter significant limitations in interpretability and generalizability, primarily due to their dependence on specific datasets, which constrains their applicability across diverse patient populations and disease manifestations.80\nThe emergence of deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized neuroimaging analysis, including MRI and PET scan interpretation. 86 These sophisticated models demonstrate remarkable precision in identifying disease-specific features, such as patterns of brain atrophy characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. CNNs trained on structural MRI data have shown particular prowess in detecting subtle patterns of cortical thinning associated with various neurodegenerative conditions.82 Despite their impressive accuracy deep learning models face significant implementation challenges. These include substantial data requirements for training, heightened risk of overfitting when applied to relatively small ADRD datasets, and limited interpretability of model outputs.87This lack of transparency complicates clinical adoption by undermining provider trust, highlighting the need for robust validation protocols, diverse training datasets, and user interfaces that translate complex model inferences into clinically meaningful explanations.88\nThe integration of multiple data modalities\u2014encompassing neuroimaging, genetic markers, biosensor data, and connected speech analysis\u2014has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing diagnostic precision.84,89 Nevertheless, these multimodal approaches continue to face substantial challenges as well, including data imbalances, limited transparency, and the necessity for sophisticated computational infrastructure, which may not be readily available in typical clinical settings.80"}, {"title": "Using LLM's for ADRD Decision Support", "content": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) may introduce a paradigm shift in ADRD care and research, offering novel approaches to clinical data interpretation and diagnostic uncertainty reduction. Unlike traditional discriminative models constrained by rigid classification frameworks, LLMs demonstrate remarkable capability in processing extensive natural language inputs, including clinical documentation and patient-generated speech, while generating probabilistic assessments from incomplete or ambiguous clinical data.\nEmpirical evidence supporting the utility of LLMs in neurodegenerative disease characterization continues to emerge. Rezaii et al. (2023) achieved unprecedented accuracy (97.9%) in classifying primary progressive aphasia variants through analysis of nuanced linguistic features in connected speech.90 Similarly, Agbavor and Liang (2022) demonstrated that GPT-3's text embeddings significantly outperformed traditional acoustic markers in dementia prediction from spontaneous speech, highlighting the potential for non-invasive, speech-based screening methodologies.91 Schubert et al. (2023) reported that GPT-4 exceeded mean human performance across several categories of neurology board-style examinations, 92 Koga et al. (2023) demonstrated the capability of ChatGPT-4 in providing neuropathologic differential diagnoses with high correlation to experts using human curated clinical summaries.\nThere are also several techniques that can further improve an LLM's performance. A diagnostic pipeline that mimics the clinical process/reasoning of a physician, including chain of thought reasoning with LLM prompts, has shown performance boosts.93 Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) can be used to ground the LLM in the most up-to-date clinical diagnostic criteria for all neurodegenerative diseases, a tool that has been continuously improving with efforts from academia and industry.94\nThe diagnostic process should be developed in conjunction with specialists both to ensure it is yielding accurate results but also to ensure that the clinicians using the Al for decision support are able to easily interact with the Al and interpret what it is doing so that when flaws in the diagnostic steps are seen, the clinician will be skeptical of the differential diagnosis instead of falling into the trap of overreliance.\nWe anticipate the successful integration of artificial intelligence in ADRD necessitates a complementary approach utilizing both discriminative and generative models. While discriminative approaches excel in distinguishing between well-defined patient populations, generative models demonstrate particular strength in hypothesis generation and management of diagnostic uncertainty characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of multimodal data analysis with generative Al's capacity for diagnostic hypothesis refinement presents a promising avenue for enhancing both the accuracy and generalizability of clinical decision support tools."}, {"title": "Management", "content": "The relational abilities LLM's display provide many opportunities for helping patients after a diagnosis, which has been written about elsewhere, including companionship and helping patients understand and navigate therapies.95 Here we focus on their potential to enhance clinician-directed care management.\nManagement of ADRD should be personalized beyond diagnosis alone, particularly given the complexity of emerging therapies. The recent introduction of anti-amyloid treatments illustrates this challenge and numerous inclusion/exclusion criteria and safety requirements make appropriate patient selection difficult, especially for providers outside of specialty centers. When given access to comprehensive patient data, Al systems can systematically evaluate these complex criteria, reducing errors and helping identify suitable candidates for specific interventions earlier. Such systems could then suggest personalized interventions ranging from disease-modifying therapies to supportive care like psychotherapy, physical therapy, and cognitive maintenance strategies. Additionally, by adapting communication to a patient's health literacy level and preferred language, these Al systems could help ensure that intervention recommendations are accessible and actionable for diverse patient populations.\nThis capability addresses a fundamental healthcare challenge: delivering the right information to the right patient at the right time. By continuously integrating the latest clinical guidelines with individual patient data across interventional domains, Al can advance precision medicine in ADRD care. Additionally, it can match patients with relevant clinical trials, a task that has become increasingly difficult for providers to manage given the rapid evolution of ADRD research and therapeutics."}, {"title": "Using and Consistently Validating a Multimodal Al Model with Explainability", "content": "The model will need to be validated once it has been developed in conjunction with clinicians. Ideally during this validation phase, clinicians are already able to seamlessly interact with the model in a manner that can be integrated into their existing workflows and allow them to interpret how the model is arriving at the differential diagnosis and management plan as well as understand potential model biases. As there is evidence clinicians are not effectively utilizing Al models,96,97 this validation phase will also need to evaluate how the physician interacts with the Al model (e.g., overreliance or underutilizing its capabilities), which can in turn inform how to best train physicians to use it. Steps may be needed to prevent overreliance, such as requiring the clinician to provide their own interpretation before revealing the Al model's interpretation.\nSpecialists will need to validate these models as they are in the best position to identify when the model is making errors and send appropriate feedback to correct the model. If these errors can be reliably predicted, warnings can be sent to the provider in circumstances that are likely to produce an error. In the real-world setting, it will also be important to evaluate how use of the Al model is affecting the provider's efficiency, productivity, and job satisfaction. Once an Al model has been optimized, its use can then be investigated with general neurologists and primary care providers, which are likely to have their own unique challenges and errors with the Al model that will need to be identified before being approved for clinical use.\nStandards for consistently monitoring the Al model will need to be established by the same governing body that establishes the data collection and sharing standards. Benchmarks will need to be agreed upon that can consistently monitor the Al model to ensure it is fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe (FAVES).98 Ultimately, a gold standard will be required to validate Al diagnostic paradigms so a neuropathology-based confirmation of whatever Al systems determine will be helpful in both establishing and refinement of diagnostic programs."}, {"title": "Continuous Learning Guided by the ADRD Community", "content": "Finally, the Al model should be continuously evolving through collaborative efforts of the healthcare community, in this case the ADRD community (Figure 1). This continuous evolution includes staying up to date with the rapidly evolving medical knowledge base as well as learning from patient cases in a supervised manner. Traditionally, what one physician learns is difficult to transmit to other physicians; however, with this system, the Al model can learn from and provide benefit to every physician using it. Physicians do not often see what happens to a patient if that patient does not follow up with them over time. There is an opportunity to build in the ability for the model to consistently revisit each patient's chart or other databases to check for updates, such as an updated diagnosis. The specialist seeing the patient could be updated as well, so they learn with the model and can take action when needed.\nModel evolution guided by the ADRD community will ultimately require using an open-source model so that there is full control over updates, which can have unpredictable consequences for specific use cases, and enables full fine-tuning. The evidence is now convincing this is feasible as it has been shown that LLMs of smaller size, meaning 70B or even 8B, can be trained to match or surpass the performance of the large proprietary models for more specific, narrower tasks including the task of answering medical questions.99\u2013101 Training these small models to perform well at subspecialty tasks is a use case that must be explored given their promise to help patients and clinicians. In this way, the medical community can fully own and control open, transparent models whose use is primarily optimized for patients and clinicians."}, {"title": "Ethical Use of Al", "content": "Ethical challenges around the use of Al in ADRD have been discussed in early 2024 by Treder et.al., 95 and therefore, a brief overview is provided here with updates that apply across healthcare. Many ethical considerations have intensified around the use of Al in healthcare, particularly since the widespread enthusiasm with generative Al since November 2022. In response, numerous initiatives have developed frameworks and guidelines to ensure Al applications are fair, appropriate, valid, effective, and safe (FAVES), which will at least in part require transparency with technical performance as well as organizational capacity to manage risks associated with deploying this technology.98 Fairness has been of particular concern as Al has shown numerous biases, 102,103 emphasizing the need for training data from diverse groups as well as ongoing monitoring to identify and quickly mitigate biases based upon the analysis of only socioeconomically privileged populations . The advancement in Al capabilities will bring new challenges with patient privacy and informed consent. 104,105 When using clinical notes for example, removing PHI may be insufficient to protect privacy,106 potentially requiring more stringent data protection and sharing guidelines. Regardless of the quality of the training data, Al tools are not static, in contrast to some pharmaceuticals whose mechanisms of action may be unclear but are safely used with patients. Therefore, explainability and interpretability 107-109 are important components for a human in the loop to potentially identify signs of model deterioration or drift at the point of care. Ethical considerations traditionally designed to protect patients will likely need to be extended to healthcare workers as well with the rapid evolution of generative Al models.110 For example, generative Al's ability to mimic providers' appearance, voice, and empathetic conversation will likely be of interest to healthcare employers with an overwhelming patient demand. This dynamic landscape has prompted calls for a network of Health Al Ethics Centers to adapt and respond to these ongoing changes to keep pace in a manner that is often difficult for a central governmental agency. 110"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "The integration of LLMs into clinical care offers transformative potential to address some of the most pressing challenges in this unprecedented time for the field of ADRD. In an era of increasing time constraints and an overwhelming volume of medical knowledge, LLM-based Al systems can support clinicians by enhancing data collection, improving diagnostic accuracy, and personalizing management, ultimately enabling more timely and high-quality patient care. However, the successful implementation of these technologies will require a rigorous framework that prioritizes inclusivity, transparency, and ongoing monitoring to ensure ethical and effective use. Collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and patients will be critical to establish standards for data collection, model development, and real-world application, ultimately fostering a continuously learning healthcare system.\nWhile this roadmap focuses on ADRD care, its principles apply broadly across neurology and other specialties facing similar challenges. With thoughtful development, LLM-based systems can not only mitigate provider shortages and diagnostic delays but also redefine care delivery, creating a future where technology and human expertise work in harmony to improve patient outcomes and advance medical knowledge."}]}

Its notable capability to acquire interpretable latent factors is partially attributed to sparse and non-negative gamma-distributed latent variables. However, the existing GBN and its variations are constrained by the linear generative model, thereby limiting their expressiveness and applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce the generalized gamma belief network (Generalized GBN) in this paper, which extends the original linear generative model to a more expressive non-linear generative model. Since the parameters of the Generalized GBN no longer possess an analytic conditional posterior, we further propose an upward-downward Weibull inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The parameters of both the generative model and the inference network are jointly trained within the variational inference framework. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both expressivity and disentangled representation learning tasks to evaluate the performance of the Generalized GBN against state-of-the-art Gaussian variational autoencoders serving as baselines.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) [Kingma and Welling, 2013, Rezende et al., 2014], which marry the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the robustness of stochastic latent variables, have gained great success in the last ten years.

To improve the expressivity of the Gaussian VAE, there is a lot of effort put into developing deeper latent variable models [S\u00f8nderby et al., 2016, Maal\u00f8e et al., 2019, Dieng et al., 2019, Vahdat and Kautz, 2020, Child, 2020, Apostolopoulou et al., 2021]. Apart from its expressive ability, the ability to disentangle data representation has also attracted wide attention [Higgins et al., 2016, Burgess et al., 2018]. A simple method to enhance disentangling ability is to increase beta parameters [Higgins et al., 2016], which may hurt the test reconstruction performance [Kim and Mnih, 2018]. Unlike these works, the Generalized GBN learns to disentangle representation by its spares and non-negative latent variables. Apart from the Gaussian VAE, other works have been proposed to model latent variables with Dirichlet distribution and sticking distribution [Joo et al., 2020, Nalisnick and Smyth, 2016]. However, these works are mainly a single-layer latent variable model, which does not directly extend to hierarchical structure.\nGamma Belief Network and its variants: As a full Bayesian generative model, the GBN [Zhou et al., 2015, 2016] has greatly progressed in mining multi-layer text representation and extracting concepts. With its attractive characters, there is a lot of effort to push it to adapt to different application scenarios. Specifically, [Guo et al., 2018] extend GBN to a deep dynamic system for temporal count data; [Wang et al., 2019, 2022] develop a convolutional GBN to capture word order information in text; and Wang et al. [2020] model graph structure for document graph. Apart from the full Bayesian model that relies on Gibbs sampler for inference, Zhang et al. [2018, 2020] build a Weibull deep autoencoder for GBN, which can utilize the neural network encoder. And [Duan et al., 2021, Li et al., 2022, Duan et al., 2023] have tried to build a more effective and deeper GBN in the form of a variational autoencoder. However, all the above works use a linear decoder with L\u2081 norm and are limited to modeling complex, dense data, such as neural images."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": "5.1 Evaluating Expressiveness\nDatasets: For binary images, we evaluate the models on two benchmark datasets: MNIST [LeCun et al., 1998], a dataset of 28 \u00d7 28 images of handwritten digits, and OMNIGLOT [Lake et al., 2013], an alphabet recognition dataset of 28 \u00d7 28 images. For convenience, we add two zero pixels to each border of the training images. In both cases, the observations are dynamically binarized by being resampled from the normalized real values using a Bernoulli distribution after each epoch, as suggested by Lake et al. [2013], which prevents over-fitting. We use the standard splits of MNIST into 60,000 training and 10,000 test examples, and of OMNIGLOT into 24,345 training and 8,070 test examples. For natural images, we evaluate the models on two benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 [Krizhevsky et al., 2009], a dataset of 32 \u00d7 32 natural images with ten classes, and CELEBA [Liu et al., 2015, Larsen et al., 2016], a face dataset of 64 x 64.\nExperiment Setting: For binary image datasets, we use a hierarchy of L = 16 variational layers, and the image decoder employs a Bernoulli distribution.

To address several issues in the BetaVAE metric, Kim and Mnih [2018] develop the FactorVAE metric by using a majority vote classifier on a different feature vector which accounts for a corner case in the BetaVAE metric. Differently, the Modularity [Ridgeway and Mozer, 2018] measures disentanglement if each dimension of the learned representation depends on at most a factor of variation using their mutual information. The Disentanglement metric of [Eastwood and Williams, 2018] ( DCI Disentanglement) computes the entropy of the distribution obtained by normalizing the importance of each dimension of the learned representation for predicting the value of a factor of variation. The SAP score [Kumar et al., 2017] is the average difference in the prediction error of the two most predictive latent dimensions for each factor."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we introduce the Generalized GBN, which extends the capabilities of the GBN by incorporating a more expressive non-linear generative model.

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.

This approach has gained significant attention due to its potential to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with drug development (Pushpakom et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2024b; Fu et al., 2022b). With the growing complexity of biological data and the increasing availability of diverse biomedical information sources (Chen et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2022b), there is a pressing need for innovative computational strategies that can efficiently integrate and analyze these vast datasets (Huang et al., 2021; Lu, 2018).\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and knowledge graphs (Gyori et al., 2017), have shown great promise in addressing these challenges (Vamathevan et al., 2019). However, the integration of heterogeneous data sources and the effective interpretation of their interrelations remain significant hurdles. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a multi-agent"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORKS", "content": "The concept of drug repurposing has evolved significantly with the advancements in computational tools, leading to a growing body of literature that explores various methodologies. Here, we highlight key developments in the field that align with our multi-agent system approach.\nMachine Learning in Drug Repurposing. Machine learning techniques have increasingly been applied to drug repurposing, demonstrating significant potential in predicting drug-disease interactions (Issa et al., 2021). Similarly, our AI Agent leverages the DeepPurpose toolkit, which has been extensively validated for its efficiency in drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions (Huang et al., 2020).\nKnowledge Graphs for Integrative Analysis. Knowledge graphs have been instrumental in providing a structured way of integrating diverse biological data. For instance, the DRKG, as employed by our Knowledge Graph Agent, integrates data from several sources, including DrugBank (Knox et al., 2024), Hetionet (Himmelstein et al., 2017), and STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2023), to offer comprehensive insights into possible drug-disease links (Ioannidis et al., 2020). This structured integration facilitates the systematic exploration of potential drug repurposing candidates.\nLiterature Search for Drug Repurposing. The automation of literature review and data extraction using AI tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), has become an essential component of modern drug discovery (Chakraborty et al., 2023). This trend is especially relevant in the field of drug repurposing, where efficient processing of vast amounts of scientific literature is crucial. Recent studies have demonstrated that LLM-based search tools can significantly enhance the efficiency and complexity of queries compared to traditional search engines (Spatharioti et al., 2023). In our framework, we leverage this approach by implementing a Search Agent that utilizes search engines as a data source for the LLM, aligning with current trends in AI-assisted literature review for drug discovery and repurposing.\nMulti-Agent Systems in Biomedical Applications. While individual AI applications have shown promise, the integration of these technologies through a multi-agent system is less explored in the field of drug repurposing. However, similar multi-agent frameworks have been successfully implemented in other areas of biomedical research, such as clinical trials (Yue & Fu, 2024). These studies provide a foundation for the application of multi-agent systems in drug repurposing, suggesting that such frameworks can enhance the predictive accuracy and efficiency of computational drug discovery."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "Our DrugAgent framework is designed to mimic the collaborative and multidisciplinary nature of drug discovery teams.

Each agent within this system plays a distinct role, mirroring the specialization seen in pharmaceutical research-some focus on machine learning models, others on search-based analysis, and another is dedicated to knowledge graph exploration."}, {"title": "3.2 AGENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES", "content": "The DrugAgent framework integrates a diverse array of specialized agents, each employing the Re-Act (Yao et al., 2022) and LEAST-TO-MOST (Zhou et al., 2022) reasoning methods to meticulously plan their actions. Through the use of advanced search capabilities, access to specialist models, and indexing in databases, these agents can execute a wide range of tasks effectively. Below, we delve into the specific roles and responsibilities assigned to each agent within the system."}, {"title": "3.3 AI AGENT", "content": "Our approach begins with the AI Agent, which utilizes the MPNN_CNN_BindingDB model from DeepPurpose (Huang et al., 2020) to predict potential drug repurposing opportunities. This model combines Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) (Gilmer et al., 2017) for processing molecular structures with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for capturing binding site features. It is trained on the comprehensive BindingDB dataset, which contains a wealth of binding affinity data for DTIs.\nThe MPNN_CNN_BindingDB model operates as follows:\n1. The MPNN component processes the molecular graph of the drug, capturing its structural features.\n2. The CNN component analyzes the binding site information of the target protein.\n3. These features are then combined and processed through fully connected layers to predict binding affinity or repurposing potential.\nThe AI Agent's predictions are continually refined through an iterative training and validation process, using cross-validation techniques to ensure accuracy and robustness."}, {"title": "3.4 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (KG) AGENT", "content": "Concurrently, the Knowledge Graph (KG) Agent employs DGIdb (Cannon et al., 2024), Drug-Bank (Knox et al., 2024), CTD (Davis et al., 2023), and STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2007). From these datasets, we make use of the DTI table and then create the vast drug-gene interaction table. From this, we calculate the number of hops to reach from the drug to the target using the below formula,\n$\\text{DTIscore}(d, t) =\\begin{cases}0 & \\text{if } d \\notin G \\text{ or } t \\notin G, \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } h(d,t) = -1, \\\\ 1 & \\text{if } h(d, t) = 1, \\\\ \\ln(1+h(d,t)) & \\text{otherwise,}\\end{cases}$ (1)\nwhere d is a drug, t is a target G is a knowledge graph h(d, t) is a number of hops in the shortest path between d and t in G and ln(\u00b7) is a natural logarithm."}, {"title": "3.5 SEARCH AGENT: INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE", "content": "Parallel to these processes, the Search Agent leverages large language models to automate the extraction of relevant information from biomedical literature, including new findings published in"}, {"title": "3.6 CALLING EXTERNAL TOOLS", "content": "GPT supports calling external tools (e.g., function, database retrieval) to leverage external knowledge and enhance its capability.

BindingDB is a public repository of measured binding affinities, primarily focusing on interactions between proteins considered as drug targets and small, drug-like molecules.\nThe Kd dataset comprises 52,284 DTI pairs, involving 10,665 unique drug-like compounds and 1,413 distinct protein targets. Kd values represent the dissociation constant, which quantifies the propensity of a larger complex to separate (dissociate) into smaller components. A lower Kd value indicates a higher binding affinity between the drug and the target protein.\nOur regression task involved predicting these Kd values given the target protein's amino acid sequence and the drug compound's SMILES string (a line notation for encoding molecular structures and specific instances) (Weininger, 1988). To evaluate our model's performance, we employed three metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 Score, and Correlation. These metrics collectively assess the accuracy of our predictions and the model's capacity to capture the underlying patterns in DTIs."}, {"title": "4.2 PROCEDURE", "content": "Each agent in our DrugAgent system was tasked with specific roles, as outlined in the Methods section.

The Coordinator Agent then synthesized these findings into a comprehensive DTI prediction. We conducted experiments to assess the accuracy of the merged DTI scores and the consistency of predictions across different methods."}, {"title": "4.3 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS", "content": "In this section, we provide detailed descriptions of the implementation processes to enhance the reproducibility of our study.\nRole Assignment to Agents Each agent within our multi-agent framework is designated a specific role, which is integrated directly into the LLM's system prompt for clarity and focus. For instance, the role of the AI Agent is defined as follows:\nThis role definition is crucial as it guides the LLM to prioritize responses based on the assigned expert domain, leveraging the model's inherent capability to focus more acutely on instructed tasks than on general information.\nDefining External Tools External tools are defined in a structured format to facilitate their integration and usage within the LLM environment. These definitions are crafted in Python functions, specifying the function name, parameters, and return types. Key examples include:\n1. AI Agent: Utilizes machine learning models for DTI scoring.\n2. Search Agent: Performs web-based information retrieval to gather relevant DTI data.\n3. KG Agent: Leverages a knowledge graph (KG) for graph-based DTI scoring.\nThis structured approach allows for the direct execution of function calls within the system, providing detailed responses, including the function name and arguments. These responses enable the retrieval of results in a structured manner.\nEnhanced Score Integration To improve the model's prediction capabilities, we incorporate a weighted integration method within the Coordinator Agent. This method, known as score merging, aids in synthesizing the outputs from different agents into a comprehensive DTI prediction. The integration is performed using predefined weights (a and \u03b2) to balance the contributions of each prediction method:\n$\\\\text{merged\\_dti\\_score} = \\alpha * ai\\_score + \\beta * search\\_score + (1 - \\alpha - \\beta) * kg\\_score$\nHere, ai_score, search_score, and kg_score represent the DTI scores from the AI Agent, Search Agent, and KG Agent, respectively. The weights $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are adjustable hyperparameters that determine the relative importance of each score in the final prediction. This approach enhances the accuracy of the model's outputs and its ability to leverage diverse prediction methods for more robust drug repurposing predictions.\nThese implementation strategies collectively ensure that each component of our multi-agent system operates effectively and that the integration between different agents and external tools is seamless, fostering an environment conducive to robust, reproducible research in drug repurposing prediction."}, {"title": "4.4 CASE STUDY", "content": "We analyze three realistic case studies focusing on drug repurposing for Topotecan, targeting different proteins: TOP1, SLFN11, and SLC26A4. Topotecan inhibits TOP1, preventing DNA religation and causing cell death in rapidly dividing cancer cells (Schmidt et al., 2001). While SLFN11 is not the direct target of Topotecan, it has been associated with Topotecan efficacy in some studies (Raynaud et al., 2023). In contrast, SLC26A4, a gene encoding pendrin (an anion exchanger protein), is not directly related to Topotecan's mechanism of action or efficacy. These cases represent a spectrum of DTIs, from well-established to potentially novel and unlikely connections. For each case, the user initiates the process by providing the drug name (Topotecan) and the target protein.

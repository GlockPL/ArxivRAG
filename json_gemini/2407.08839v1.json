Introduction", "content": "Cybersecurity stands as an indispensable pillar in our increasingly digital world. With the pervasive infusion of technology into every corner of our daily lives, from personal communication [1, 2] and financial transactions [3] to critical network infrastructure [4, 5] and national security [6, 7], the need for robust and effective cybersecurity solutions has reached unprecedented levels. The digital landscape is fraught with an ever-evolving array of threats, including data breaches, malware, ransomware, and cyberattacks, bringing severe risks to individuals, businesses, and public interests [8, 9, 10]. Therefore, safeguarding our digital assets and infrastructure has become a primary concern.\nCybersecurity is confronted with many challenges, such as Adversarial Attacks [11, 12], Malware Detection [13], Network Intrusion Detection [14, 15], etc. First, adversarial attacks [16, 17, 18] are a noteworthy example of these challenges, in which malevolent actors deliberately take advantage of a vulnerability in cyber-infrastructure, artificial-intelligent (AI) systems, or machine learning (ML) models. For example, adversarial attacks can inconspicuously manipulate the training or test data so that the victim models may probably misclassify instances on the test data [19, 20]. Second, malware [21] is always evolving, and obfuscation techniques are used to outpace conventional detection methods, making malware detection an even more difficult task. Writers of malware are always creating new variants; one example is metamorphic malware, which changes its code structure but keeps working, avoiding detection by static analysis tools. Third, network intrusion detection systems [22, 23, 24] aim to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts, but attackers can evade the detection by using strategies like encrypted traffic and zero-day vulnerability exploitation. The increasing use of encryption in network traffic introduces a layer of complexity that makes it more difficult for intrusion detection systems [25, 26] to detect malicious activity and analyze packet content. The difficulties highlight demands for defending the cybersecurity threats.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [27], a type of deep-learning model [28, 29, 30], present promising solutions for tackling the above challenges [31]. Vanilla GANs consist of two main components: a generator and a discriminator [32, 33]. The generator intends to create fabricated examples that closely resemble the actual examples. On the other hand, the discriminator is specifically developed to distinguish between legitimate examples and fabricated ones. GAN models have frequently been utilized in various cybersecurity applications over the past few years. One such application involves using GANs to strengthen machine learning models against adversarial attacks by generating adversarial samples, which can ultimately lead to improved defenses against adversarial manipulations [34]. From the perspective of detection tasks, such as detecting malware and intrusion attempts on a network, GANs can augment threat detection mechanisms by simulating malicious behaviors, such as creating malware that can bypass antivirus or generating phishing emails that can fool both humans and machines [35]. In this context, integrating GAN-based models into cybersecurity strategies holds great promise, offering innovative solutions to the complex challenges that continue to evolve in the digital age.\nIn this work, we aspire to deliver a comprehensive exploration of the various applications and implications of GAN-based models in cybersecurity. Particularly, we investigate how GAN-based models address the following cyber threats: malware detection, anomaly detection, intrusion detection, etc. Our main objective is to provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the current development of GAN-based models in cybersecurity, including a breakdown of challenges, identification of common trends, and discussion on future directions, that serve as a guide for future research and real-world developments using GAN-based models to tackle new cybersecurity issues.\nIn summary, our contributions to this survey oscillate in diverse cybersecurity domains, including but not limited to malware detection, intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and detecting specific attacks like adversarial attacks, where Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can provide novel solutions. The main contribution can be outlined as follows:.\n\u2022 We systematically review the most recent literature on applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address cyber threats.\n\u2022 We unveil a new taxonomy designated in this survey.

Intrusion Detection System", "content": "Cybersecurity is crucial to protect the increasing amount of stored data and its transmission on networks. Regular updates to threat detection techniques are necessary to prevent advanced attacks [36, 37]. Using GANs for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) introduces a novel and promising approach to enhancing cybersecurity. The survey [38] aims to investigate the potential use of GANs in cybersecurity, specifically for intrusion detection systems (IDS). The researchers conducted a comprehensive survey of current research and methods related to GANs in IDS, including topics such as model privacy, attack evasion, dataset evaluation, and various GAN model variants. However, this research focuses primarily on the use of GANs in IDS and does not extensively cover other areas of cybersecurity."}, {"title": "2.2. Malware Detection", "content": "Conventional malware detections often rely on signature-based methods or behavioral analysis, which can be limited in their ability to identify polymorphic or previously unseen malware variants [39, 40]. GAN is promising for Malware Detection since it can identify previously unseen malware variants through its ability to analyze patterns and generate new ones. Ling et al. [41] provide a detailed overview of the latest adversarial attacks on Windows PE malware detection and the corresponding defenses. The authors discuss three significant challenges in maintaining the meaning of adversarial PE malware to create practical and realistic adversarial attacks, namely format-preservation, executability-preservation, and maliciousness-preservation. Recent research efforts in adversarial attacks and defenses have been reviewed, and an organized taxonomy has been developed to summarize the existing literature. The authors suggest that researchers should focus on developing more effective and efficient defenses against adversarial attacks, exploring new techniques for generating and detecting adversarial examples, and investigating the use of reinforcement learning and other advanced machine learning techniques to improve the robustness of malware detection systems."}, {"title": "2.3. Anomaly Detection", "content": "Unsupervised learning [42] or clustering techniques [43] are widely used for anomaly detection, whereas GANs are one of the cutting-edge approaches within these categories, offering a range of advantages in identifying unusual patterns or behaviors in diverse datasets. For example, Xia et al. [44] propose a GAN-based unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting anomalies. This study indicates that GANs can identify abnormal patterns by learning to represent samples through adversarial learning.

Miscellaneous Cyber Threats", "content": "2.4.1. Malicious Domain Detection\nThe research paper [45] highlights the importance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the field of cybersecurity. GANs are used to overcome the challenge of identifying malicious domain names generated through Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). They prove to be a valuable tool in enhancing the detection of malicious domain names generated by DGAS. GANs produce synthetic data that leads to more effective model training and improved accuracy in identifying malicious domains [46].\nHowever, the survey has some limitations. It identifies the need for developing new datasets and approaches for Deep Learning (DL) in cybersecurity but does not provide specific recommendations or guidelines on how to address these needs.\nThe survey indicates that there is a need for further research in the development of new datasets. These datasets should take into account the perspective of potential adversaries and consider how they could use DL techniques to evade detection mechanisms. Comparing the performance metrics of DL methods in real operational cases is crucial, according to the survey. It emphasizes the significance of testing DL techniques in real-life situations to assess their efficiency. Furthermore, the survey highlights the importance of having extensive benchmark datasets that are frequently updated to promote the progress of cybersecurity solutions and establish a strong sense of confidence in DL techniques.\n2.4.2. Jamming Attack Detection\nWu et al. propose two GAN-based methods to identify network attacks [47]. The first method aims to detect jamming attacks in wireless communication by using a classifier to predict channel states and determine whether to transmit based on sensing outcomes.

Fundamentals of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)", "content": "In the ever-evolving realm of cybersecurity, employing cutting-edge technology is essential to maintaining an advantage over adversaries. In 2014, Goodfellow et al. first introduced vanilla GANs [27], which has garnered substantial attention in recent years."}, {"title": "3.1. GANS Defination", "content": "GANs are widely used in generative tasks. The generation capacity can be achieved by leveraging the strong representation of deep neural networks. As depicted in Figure 2, vanilla GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator (G) and a discriminator (D). During the training process, the generator G takes random noise as input and generates fake samples. In the meanwhile, the discriminator D distinguishes the difference between generated and ground-truth samples. Both neural networks are playing a zero-sum game during this process. After the loss curve is converged, the model reaches the Nash Equilibrium. The total loss function can be formulated as follows:\n\n$L_{GAN} = E_{x\\sim P_{data}(x)}[log D(x)]+[E_{z\\sim p_{z}(z)} [log(1 \u2013 D(G(z)))],$ \n\nwhere x and z denote real data and random noise, respectively. $P_{data} (x)$ and $p_{z}(z)$ denote the distribution of real data and random noise, respectively. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are commonly used as an activation function to capture the non-linear relationship. Overall, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling by introducing a novel adversarial training paradigm."}, {"title": "3.2. GAN Variation", "content": "Vanilla and Conditional GAN Due to the extraordinary performance of GAN, variants of GAN have been widely studied [49]. Conditional GAN [49] is one of such variants that incorporates supplementary information, such as labels, into generating data.\nRandhawa et al. [50] employ two different GAN architectures for generating botnet traffic. The first architecture is the vanilla GAN, where the generator model G generates samples from a noise space, and the discriminator model D evaluates the generated samples. The estimation of probability for generated and real data forms the basis of the loss function for the combined model. The provided document does not go into great detail about the second architecture, which is the conditional GAN. The study notes that further research needs to be conducted to determine an appropriate GAN for producing botnet data.\nWasserstein GAN (WGAN) Duy et al. [51] propose a variant of GANs, namely Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), that derives from using Wasserstein distance during optimization, to enhance the training stability of GAN-based models. The goal of WGAN is to use an input dataset to train a generative model that can efficiently generate adversarial samples. In the WGAN training process, the discriminator and generator compete in a minimax objective in which the discriminator attempts to identify fake samples while the generator uses its generated samples to deceive it. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [52] has shown excellent performance among various GAN variants. The research [53] incorporates Wasserstein GAN, which measures distribution differences as Wasserstein distance, in contrast to the conventional GAN that employs Jensen-Shannon distance. By creating virtual malware for detector training, this GAN-based method overcomes the problem of malware obfuscation and initializes the generative model. The primary objective is to produce modified data that exhibits resilience against malware deformations, thereby extending the detector's capability to identify a broader spectrum of malware. This innovative approach not only enables the encoder and detector to withstand modifications but also facilitates training with a more diverse dataset, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the detector.\nConditional Wasserstein GAN The conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been used in this study [54] to generate additional training data for minority classes in the network intrusion detection (NID) model. The GAN is improved to enhance its performance in generating realistic and diverse synthetic data. The generated data is then used to balance the imbalanced ratios between different types of network intrusions. The conditional Wasserstein GAN is combined with a cost-sensitive stacked autoencoder to extract features and construct the NID model. Benchmark datasets are used to assess the model's performance, and the accuracy obtained is reported. The model [55] combines an XGBoost Classifier and a Wasserstein Conditional GAN (WCGAN). To address the problem of data imbalance, the WCGAN is used to generate synthetic data samples for minority attack classes. The discriminator serves as a mentor for the generator, which is trained to generate realistic data samples that match the real training attack data samples. Promising results are observed when the performance of the suggested model has been evaluated and compared with other GAN models.\nGAPGAN and GANILLA The application of GANs to adversarial attacks against Windows PE malware detection is covered in the paper [41]. The paper specifically mentions GAPGAN and GANILLA, two GAN-based attack frameworks. Black-box adversarial attack framework GAPGAN creates byte-level adversarial payloads to counter MalConv and other DL-based malware detection systems. The discriminator tries to mimic the black-box PE malware detector in order to detect both the generated adversarial PE malware and the original PE goodware. The generator creates adversarial payloads that are appended to original malware samples during the training process. Conversely, GANILLA is a white-box adversarial attack framework that modifies the original PE malware samples to produce adversarial ones. The generator creates adversarial PE malware samples by adding to or altering the original PE malware samples, and the discriminator tries to discern between the adversarial and original PE malware samples. The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously. Compared to current techniques, the authors assert that GANILLA can produce adversarial PE malware samples that are more realistic.\nPlausMal-GAN Won et al. [56] introduce a GAN-based framework, PlausMal-GAN, that can detect zero-day malware by generating high-quality and diverse analogous malware images. PlausMal-GAN addresses the challenges of data insufficiency and imbalance in zero-day malware detection, producing reliable accuracy performances and outperforming previous methods. Several GAN models are integrated into the framework, such as DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP, and E-GAN. Each model is assessed by a discriminator and the generator that performs the best moves on to the next phase. PlausMal-GAN's methodology involves training a generator and discriminator with malware data, encompassing two key steps: initial training using real and generated malware data and re-training with real and generated data. This framework demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting and predicting numerous analogous zero-day malware instances, showcasing superior accuracy and providing consistent results across malware classification metrics. In summary, PlausMal-GAN serves as a robust malware training framework underpinned by GAN, elevating zero-day malware detection with its ability to generate high-quality, diverse malware samples and deliver dependable performance, even when confronted with limited training data, surpassing prior approaches in terms of accuracy and classification results.\nDefense-GAN Reilly et al. [57] present Defense-GAN in the context of protecting classifiers against adversarial attacks in malware classification. Defense-GAN, introduced by Samangouei et al., is a framework that utilizes generative models to enhance the robustness of classifiers. Defense-GAN has demonstrated efficacy against black-box and white-box attacks on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets, according to the paper. By using GAN-generated samples for training, the researchers hope to strengthen a model's resilience in the context of malware classification.\nDeep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) Lu et al. [58] state challenges of deep learning-based malware classification tasks. A deep model needs a large amount of training data to be trained. To augment the training data and raise the classifier's classification accuracy, the authors suggest a method that creates synthetic malware samples using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The effectiveness of the suggested method in enhancing classification accuracy is demonstrated by evaluating it on the Malimg dataset and comparing it with other cutting-edge techniques.\nFID-GAN The need for efficient and effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) that can meet low-latency requirements and detect new cyber-attacks without labeled data was addressed in the paper [59]. FID-GAN, a unique fog-based, unsupervised IDS for CPSs utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is the suggested remedy. In order to meet low-latency requirements, FID-GAN computes a reconstruction loss based on the reconstruction of data samples mapped to the latent space. Two datasets are used to evaluate the proposed architecture, and the findings demonstrate that FID-GAN performs better than current state-of-the-art techniques in terms of false alarm rate and detection accuracy. Non-labeled data can also be used by FID-GAN to identify new cyberattacks. FID-GAN is an unsupervised approach to detecting cyberattacks by implicitly modeling the system using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Unlike supervised approaches that require labeled data for training, unsupervised approaches can detect novel attacks without labeled data.\nG-IDS In this study [60], the GAN variant used is called G-IDS, which stands for Generative Intrusion Detection System. G-IDS is a framework that utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate more training data for an imbalanced dataset in cyber-physical systems (CPS) security. The G-IDS framework improves the performance of the intrusion detection system (IDS) by addressing the limitations of insufficient and imbalanced data.\nInfo GAN Chen et al. [61] present a variant of GAN, InfoGAN, that facilitates interpretable representation learning by optimizing the information present in the adversarial nets that are produced. With the aid of this GAN variation, image content can be represented in a high-dimensional manner and then reduced to new images, enabling the classifier to distinguish between important pieces of evidence that are similar and different.\nFederated Generative Adversarial Network (FedGAN) The paper [62] mentions the use of a variant of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called Federated Generative Adversarial Network (FedGAN). FedGAN is utilized in the Internet of Things (IoT) context of distributed intrusion detection. An particular kind of GAN is used to produce data from adversarial attacks and categorize it. The discriminator and the generator are the two parts of the FedGAN. A particular type of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is used in the work of Das et al. [63] to detect anomalies in network traffic. It tackles the difficulties of teaching GANs to identify anomalies in big networks with a variety of traffic types as well as the requirement for dataset privacy. Because FGAN uses a federated architecture, various network users can train and modify an adversarial model that is centrally available based on their unique circumstances. This approach enables localized and coordinated training, enhancing anomaly detection in medium to large-sized networks.\nMDGAN MDGAN, which stands for \"Multifaceted Deep Generative Adversarial Networks Model,\" [13] is a new way to improve mobile security by tackling the danger of malware attacks. MDGAN is designed to find malware on mobile devices. It uses a multifaceted input method that blends 2D grayscale image features with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) binary sequence features. This one-of-a-kind approach makes it possible to find different kinds of malware, which makes the model more flexible. The skeleton is organized into three main parts. First, the raw APK package is preprocessed to create an API sequence file and a binary image. Subsequently, features are extracted from the binary image using GoogleNet, and stable features are obtained from the API sequence file using an LSTM network. Then, these features are joined together to make a single multi-face input for the model. Notably, MDGAN uses a GAN as part of its design to improve the training data."}, {"title": "4.

Cybersecurity Challenges", "content": "In this context, we take a closer look at some of the state-of-the-art papers and provide easy-to-understand explanations for the challenges in cybersecurity.\n4.1.1. Adversarial Attacks and Adversarial Example Generation Challenges\nRadhawa et al. [50] propose a method to reduce the adverse effects of adversarial evasion attacks. These attacks are altered input samples designed to deceive the classifier. These attacks can compromise the accuracy of botnet detectors, creating significant security challenges. The research also focuses on improving recall, which is the ability of the classifier to identify botnet traffic from the dataset correctly. However, not all classifiers and datasets showed significant improvement in recall, which means that further investigation and improvement are necessary in this area.\nThe research also addresses the problem of dataset imbalance and obsolescence, which can affect the effectiveness of botnet detectors. To keep these detectors up-to-date and effective, it is necessary to add new and unseen attacks to the datasets continuously. Generating large amounts of botnet data that have not been seen before can be difficult, but synthetic oversampling techniques like the use of GANs can help overcome this challenge.\nMoreover, the research also highlights the need to explore the behaviors and landscapes of modern botnets. This involves introducing new traffic features to differentiate botnets from normal traffic. Modern GANs can also be used to generate better-quality adversarial examples and improve the overall efficacy of botnet detection.\nThese challenges underscore the complexity of addressing adversarial evasion attacks, dataset imbalance, and the need for continuous research and improvement in the field of botnet detection.\nZhang et al. [52] have highlighted the challenges that machine learning-based systems face in the realm of cybersecurity due to the emergence of adversarial examples (AEs). Adversarial examples are maliciously crafted noises added to original inputs with the aim of making target classifiers misclassify, thereby posing new threats to the security-critical applications in cybersecurity. The research points out that there is a lack of relevant studies in the domain of cybersecurity regarding AEs. Although some pioneering works have highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks to AEs, more attention needs to be paid to AEs in cybersecurity to address the new threats they pose to machine learning-based systems. The current research on AEs mainly focuses on computer vision, with only a few studies on AEs in cybersecurity. This highlights the need for further research to evaluate better the robustness of machine learning classifiers in cybersecurity against AEs. To summarize, the research underscores the challenges that machine learning-based systems face in cybersecurity due to the emergence of AEs. It stresses the need for more research in this domain to address"}, {"title": "4.1.2. Interrpretibility of Deep Learning", "content": "Ge et al. [69] elucidates critical challenges permeating the realm of cybersecurity analysis. At the forefront of these challenges is a discernible trade-off between the performance prowess of AI models and their interpretability. While leveraging deep learning techniques can significantly elevate the quality of results, their inherent lack of transparency erects a formidable barrier for human operators. Understanding and trusting the decision-making processes of AI become intricate tasks, casting shadows on the seamless integration of these advanced models into cybersecurity operations.\nA second pivotal challenge highlighted in the paper revolves around user comprehension. Existing methods grapple with providing comprehensive evidentiary support for recognition decisions, leaving human operators in a quandary. The insufficiency of information makes it challenging for operators to fully grasp and instill confidence in the outputs generated by AI systems. Bridging this gap between complex AI decisions and human interpretability emerges as a crucial area for improvement in the cybersecurity landscape.\nThe work also underscores the overarching complexity of cybersecurity analysis, which spans diverse domains, including network security, threat intelligence, and attack detection. This complexity begets challenges across the entire spectrum, from data analysis to model development and the amalgamation of diverse techniques. Navigating this multifaceted landscape necessitates concerted efforts in research and development. The call to action emanating from the challenges is clear \u2013 a trajectory toward the conception and implementation of more interpretable and understandable AI solutions in the cybersecurity domain. As the threat landscape evolves, the imperative for transparent and comprehensible AI models becomes increasingly paramount, guiding the trajectory of future advancements in cybersecurity research and practice.\nThe study [41] focuses on the absence of a clear understanding of DL models used in malware detection, which makes it difficult to understand how the models make decisions and identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. There is difficulty in generating adversarial examples that are both effective and realistic, as the generated samples need to maintain the format, executability, and maliciousness of the actual malware samples. The hardship of generating adversarial examples can evade detection by multiple malware detection systems, as different systems may use different features and detection methods. The challenge of generating adversarial examples that are transferable means that they can be effective against different models or systems. Effective adversarial defenses are difficult to develop, as they must be able to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks while maintaining the performance of the malware detection system. This is a method of dealing with the dynamic nature of malware, as attackers can constantly modify and evolve their malware to evade detection."}, {"title": "4.1.3. Data Related Challenge", "content": "The detection of network attacks in cybersecurity poses a challenge when it comes to imbalanced datasets. Currently, the datasets used as benchmarks for network intrusion detection are imbalanced, indicating a significant difference in the number of samples available for different types of attacks as noted by Chui et al.

A three-stage algorithm was proposed in the research to generate data that mitigates the impact of imbalanced ratios in minority classes. The algorithm uses a synthetic minority over-sampling technique, a generative adversarial network, and a variational autoencoder to generate data of high quality. By addressing this challenge, the research aimed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of network intrusion detection models [71, 72].\nKar et al.

One of the challenges is false data injection (FDI) attacks, which involve corrupting data streams from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) by hacking into the wide-area communication network channels. Another challenge is denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which temporarily deactivate a link to obstruct the PMU data from reaching its desired destination. These attacks require effective detection and mitigation methods to ensure the security and safety of power systems.\nRandhawa et al. [74] delve into the intricate challenges prevalent in cybersecurity datasets, notably tackling the pervasive issue of data imbalance. In many instances, these datasets exhibit a disproportionality, with an abundance of normal behavior samples compared to the relatively scarce anomaly samples. This inherent data imbalance poses a substantial challenge, as it can introduce decision bias in machine learning classifiers, potentially compromising the efficacy of intrusion detection systems. The study critically addresses this data scarcity problem, recognizing the pivotal role it plays in the accurate classification of cyber threats.\nShahriar et al.

Malware authors use techniques such as packing and obfuscation to create numerous variants that outpace signature-based detection methods. Additionally, they highlight the challenge of detecting and analyzing malicious traffic patterns initiated by these variants, especially on servers that store sensitive information. Traditional detection schemes are also vulnerable to adversarial samples, making the development of anomaly detection methods crucial. Finally, the challenge of limited data samples and the need to detect zero-day exploits has been addressed.\nMoreover, wang et al.

Accurately detecting network intrusions is also a challenge mentioned in the study, along with concerns about data privacy in intrusion detection systems. The suggested approach uses federated learning to tackle these problems. This enables the utilization of training data at local levels and the sharing of encrypted models, all while guaranteeing the protection of confidential information. The study also recognizes the challenge of coordinating model updates in large-scale networks and highlights the problem of model tampering, where attackers may try to modify the trained model.\nPark et al.

In this paper, we define a metric Z-counts to measure the difficulty of training each triple (<head entity, relation, tail entity>) in KGs with theoretical analysis. Based on this metric, we propose CL4KGE, an efficient Curriculum Learning based training strategy for KGE. This method includes a difficulty measurer and a training scheduler that aids in the training of KGE models. Our approach possesses the flexibility to act as a plugin within a wide range of KGE models, with the added advantage of adaptability to the majority of KGs in existence. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular KGE models, and the results demonstrate that it enhances the state-of-the-art methods.

We define it as:\n$$f(h, r, t) = \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if (h, r, t) holds,} \\\\ +\\infty, & \\text{otherwise,} \\end{cases}$$\nwhere h, r, and t are the embeddings of entities h, r, and t, respectively, and r is a relation function mapping from Rd \u00d7 Rd to R+ U {0}.\nGiven two elements in a triplet (h, r, t) with a score function f (h, r, t), the task of link prediction is to add the most logical element with the highest confidence level in the remaining position. Translation distance-based approaches often describe relations using geometric transformations of entities, and they assess the plausibility of fact triples by comparing the distances between entity embedding following relation transformations. Also, each translation distance-based KG method will define a unique score function. However, deep learning-based KGE methods follow a different way to encoder the triplet which could use some popular neural networks including CNNs (Dettmers et al., 2018; Nguyen & Grishman, 2015), RNNs (Zhang & Wang, 2015), and GNNs (Vashishth et al., 2020)."}, {"title": "Remark 3.1.", "content": "The task of link prediction involves predicting the missing elements in such triplets to infer new facts and relationships in the knowledge graph. Specifically, if either h or t is missing, the goal is to identify the most plausible entity that completes the triplet based on the embeddings and learned patterns in the graph. The primary motivation for link prediction is that knowledge graphs are typically incomplete; not all possible relationships between entities are known or present. Therefore, link prediction aims to discover these missing links, enhancing the knowledge graph's completeness and utility. For instance:\n\u2022 Predicting the tail entity t given (h, r, ?)\n\u2022 Predicting the head entity h given (?, r, t)\nThe plausibility of a predicted link is usually quantified using a scoring function that assesses how likely a given triplet (h, r, t) is to be true within the learned embedding space of the knowledge graph."}, {"title": "3.2 Curriculum Learning", "content": "Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that mimics the suitable learning sequence seen in human curricula by training a machine learning model from easy to difficult data.

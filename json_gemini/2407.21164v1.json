Introduction", "content": "In classical probability theory, decisions are typically made by maximising expected utility. This leads\nto a single optimal decision, or a set of optimal decisions all of which are equivalent. In the theory of\nimprecise probabilities, where multiple probabilistic models are considered simultaneously, this decision rule\ncan be generalised in multiple ways; Troffaes [1] provides a nice overview. A typical feature of the resulting\ndecision rules is that they will not always yield a single optimal decision, as a decision that is optimal in one\nprobability model may for example be suboptimal in another.\nWe here take this generalisation yet another step further by adopting the theory of choice functions: a\nmathematical framework for decision-making that incorporates several (imprecise) decision rules as special\ncases, including the classical approach of maximising expected utility [2, 3, 4]. An important feature of\nthis framework of choice functions is that it allows one to impose axioms directly on the decisions that are\nrepresented by such a choice function [3, 4, 5]. We here adopt the coherence axioms that were put forward\nby De Bock and De Cooman [3]. We do not use these axioms directly though, but instead consider an\nalternative definition of coherence that is based on sets of preference orders and show that it is equivalent.\nAs we will explain and demonstrate in this contribution, we can use these coherent choice function to\ninfer new choices from previous choices. In particular, for any given assessment of previous choices that\nis compatible with coherence, we will achieve this by introducing the so-called natural extension of this\nassessment: the unique most conservative coherent choice function that is compatible with the assessment.\nWe start in Section 2 with an introduction to choice functions and coherence. Section 3 then first defines\nchoice assessments, their consistency and their natural extension, and then goes on to reformulate these\nconcepts in terms of coherent sets of desirable options. Next, in Section 4, we show how this reduces the\nproblems of checking the consistency of an assessment and computing its natural extension to something\nthat we can solve practically and algorithmically. The running time of the algorithm depends rather heavily\non the size of the assessment that is provided though. To reduce this running time, Sections 5 and 6 present\nseveral methods that can be used to replace an assessment by an equivalent object that contains the same"}, {"title": "2. Choice functions", "content": "A choice function C is a function that, when applied to a set of options, may reject one or more-but\nnot all options from that set. The options that are not rejected are then said to be 'chosen'. Usually the\noptions are actions that have a corresponding reward. This reward furthermore depends on the state of an\nunknown uncertain-variable X that takes values in a set X. We will assume that the rewards can be\nrepresented by real numbers, on a real-valued utility scale. In this setting, an option u is thus a function\nfrom states x in X to R. We will denote the set of all possible options by V \u2286 RX and require that this\nforms a real vector space with pointwise vector addition and scalar multiplication. Bounded options are\nsometimes also called gambles in the literature. Moreover, we endowy with the partial order <: for all\nu, v \u2208 V, u \u2264 v if and only if u(x) \u2264 v(x) for all x \u2208 X; < is the corresponding strict version, so u < v if\nu \u2264 v and u \u2260 v.1 We also let 2V denote the power set of V. To make all of this more tangible, we consider\nthe following toy problem as a running example.\nFiniteness of sets will be important throughout this paper, and we therefore introduce the symbol \u2208 to\nmean that a set is a non-empty finite subset. A first example is that we will restrict ourselves to choices\nfrom finite sets of options. That is, the domain of our choice functions will be 2 := {A: A \u2208 V}, the set of\nall finite subsets of V excluding the empty set. We also let 20 := 2U {0}. Formally, a choice function is\nthen any function C: 2 \u2192 2 such that C(A) C A for all A \u2208 2. We will also consider the corresponding\nrejection function Rc : 2 \u2192 2: A\u2194 A \\ C(A).\nWe will give the following interpretation to these choice functions. For every set A \u2208 2 and option\nu \u2208 A, we take u \u2208 C(A)-u is 'chosen' to mean that there is no other option in A that is preferred to u.\nEquivalently, u \u2208 Rc(A)\u2014u is rejected from A-if there is an option in A that is preferred to u.\nDe Bock and De Cooman [3] define coherent choice functions by imposing properties for rationality on\nthe corresponding rejection functions.

Examples", "content": "Let us now try to get a bit more feel for the previous theory by looking at some well-known (sets\nof) orderings. We will show, for example, that due to the connection between preference orders and so-\ncalled coherent lower expectations, decision-making with maximality or E-admissibility [1], or by maximising\nexpected utility, all fit in our framework. To do this, we will assume in this Section 2.1 that V is the subset\nof R^\\mathcal{X} that contains all bounded options (that is, all gambles).\n2.1.1. Lower expectations\nA coherent lower expectation E is a functional on V that satisfies the following properties: for all f, g \u2208 V\nand x \u2265 0 [9, Section 2.2.1],\n$\\begin{array}{ll}\n1.& E(f) \\geq \\inf(f), \\\\\n2.& E(f + g) \\geq E(f) + E(g), \\\\\n3.& E(\\lambda f) = \\lambda E(f).\\end{array}$$\\qquad$$\\begin{array}{l}\\\text{(boundedness)}\\\\(super-linearity)\\\\(non-negative homogeneity)\n\\end{array}$$\nThey are relevant to our framework because, as discussed by Quaeghebeur [9, Section 1.6.3], every preference\norder $$\\prec$$\u2014or, equivalently, every corresponding coherent set of desirable options $G_\\prec := \\{u \\in V : 0 \\prec u\\}$\u2014\ndetermines a coherent lower expectation\n$E: V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}: u \\mapsto E_\\prec(u) := \\sup\\{a \\in \\mathbb{R}: a \\prec u\\} = \\sup\\{a \\in \\mathbb{R}: u - a \\in G_\\prec\\},$ where we identify any real number a with the option that takes on the constant value a. The lower\nexpectation E 'forgets' only the 'border structure' of the preference order, in the sense that the original\npreference order can be retrieved up to its boundary behaviour. A pseudoinverse that we consider here is\n$\\prec_E := \\{(u, v): u\\prec v \\text{ or } 0 \\prec E(v \u2013 u)\\},$ as this is the most conservative preference order, i.e. the smallest one, that also extends $$\\prec$$. All possible\npseudoinverses are preference orders $$\\prec$$ for which $$\\prec$$$$\\subseteq$$ \\{(u, v) : 0 \u2264 E(v \u2013 u) and u \u2260 v\\}; for each such\npseudoinverse $$\\prec$$, including $$\\prec_E$$, we have that $E_\\prec = E$.\nIn the special case that $E(u) = \u2212E(-u)$ for all u \u2208 V, E is a linear functional [9, Section 2.2.2] and\nis therefore called a linear expectation. Such a linear expectation is typically denoted simply as E. When\nX is finite, these linear expectations have a unique corresponding so-called probability mass function (pmf)\n$p: X \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ with $\\Sigma_{x\\exp(x)} = 1$ such that $E(u) = E_p(u) := \\Sigma_{x\\in\\mathcal{X}}p(x)u(x)$ for every option u \u2208 V. This\nmakes such linear expectations particularly easy to specify and evaluate.\nAn important observation, that will prove convenient in Section 7, is that a general coherent lower expec-\ntation E can also be interpreted as a lower envelope of a set of such linear expectations [9, Propositions 2.3].\nIn particular, if X is finite, then for every coherent lower expectation E there is a closed convex set P of\npmfs such that $E(u) = \\min_{p\\in P} E_p(u)$ for every option u \u2208 V. In practice this set P will furthermore often\nhave a finite number of extreme points $p_1, ..., p_m$, in which case we can evaluate E efficiently because then\n$E(u) = \\min_{i=1, ..., m} E_{p_i}(u)$ for every option u \u2208 V.\n2.1.2. Decision-making based on lower expectations\nSince preference orders are related to coherent lower expectations, it should not come as a surprise that\nthe same is true for choice functions, or decision-making.\nThe classical way of decision-making is by maximising expected utility, as for example described in [1,\nSection 2], in which case we start from a single linear expectation E that determines everything. For any\noption set A \u2208 2, we then map every option u \u2208 A to its expected utility E(u) and choose the option that\nmaximises this expected utility, or in case of a tie, the set of options that maximise it and are undominated"}, {"title": "3. Consistency and the natural extension of a choice assessment", "content": "Now that we are familiar with choice functions, we move on to the topic of this paper: how to extend a\npartial choice assessment to a coherent choice function. In this endeavour, we consider a decision-maker and\nassume that there is some coherent choice function C that represents her preferences. However, we (or she)\nmay not fully know this function. Our partial information about C comes in the form of preferences regarding\nsome so not necessarily all option sets.

A careful decision-maker would only want to reject options if this\nis implied by the assessment. So she wants a most conservative agreeing coherent choice function: one that\nrejects the fewest number of options. Since larger sets of preference orders lead to more conservative choice\nfunctions, this most conservative agreeing choice function then clearly exists, and is then equal to CO(A).\nFor notational convenience, for any assessment A, we denote this function by CA := Co(A), regardless of\nwhether A is consistent; the term natural extension though, we reserve for the consistent case.\nDefinition 3.3.

If G is not consistent then all statements are trivially true by Equation (16) because 0 = u-u \u2208 \u0410-\u0438.\nSo we only have to handle the case where G is consistent. We give a circular proof of the negation of all\nstatements.\nFirst we prove that the negation of statement (i) implies the negation of statement (ii). Assume that for\nall $$\\prec$$\u2208 O[G] there is some a \u2208 A such that u$$\\prec$$a. Then for any D \u2208 GG, by Lemma 2.3, $$\\prec_D$$ is a preference\norder such that $G_{\\prec D} = D$. It therefore follows from Equation (14) that $$\\prec_D$$\u2208 O[G]. Therefore, there is some\na \u2208 A such that u $$\\prec_D$$ a. Hence, a \u2013 u \u2208 D, so that (A \u2013 u) \u2229 D \u2260 0.\nNext we prove that the negation of statement (ii) implies the negation of statement (iii). Assume that\nfor all D EGG we have (A-u)\u2229D \u2260 0. By [5, Theorem 2], since G is consistent, we have that N(G) \u2208 GG,\nwhich immediately implies statement (iii).\nFinally, we prove that the negation of statement (iii) implies the negation of statement (i). Assume that\n(A \u2013 u) \u2229N(G) \u2260 0. Take any $$\\prec$$\u2208 O[G]. Since G is consistent, we have that N(G) is the smallest coherent\nset of desirable options in GG [5, Theorem 2, (v)]. Moreover, by Equation (14) we have that G C G< and,\nby Lemma 2.3 that G<< \u2208 G, so G<< \u2208 GG. Whence, N(G) \u2286 G<. Therefore, since (A \u2013 u) \u2229N(G) \u2260 0,\nthere is some a \u2208 A such that a - u \u2208 G<. By definition and Axiom 2 this means that a$$prec$$u."}, {"title": "Lemma 3.11.", "content": "A generator G \u2286 2V is consistent if and only if there is some G\u2208 G such that 0 $$\\notin$$ N(G).\nProof.

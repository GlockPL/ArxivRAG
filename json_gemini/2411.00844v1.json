However, most existing methods can only predict up to four hours in the future, which doesn't quite meet real-world demands. we identify that the prediction horizon is limited to a few hours mainly due to the separation of temporal and spatial factors, which results in high complexity. Drawing inspiration from Albert Einstein's relativity theory, which suggests space and time are unified and inseparable, we introduce Extralonger, which unifies temporal and spatial factors. Extralonger notably extends the prediction horizon to a week on real-world benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency in the training time, inference time, and memory usage. It sets new standards in long-term and extra-long-term scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/PlanckChang/Extralonger.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Traffic forecasting stands as a pivotal endeavor within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This task aims to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics in traffic road networks by analyzing historical time steps across monitoring stations and subsequently forecasting future time steps. [1-3] Previous works denote raw traffic data as $X \\in R^{T\\times N\\times C}$, where T signifies the time steps length, N represents the count of monitoring stations, and C denotes the raw feature channel. They conceptualize traffic road networks as graphs, with nodes representing monitoring stations and edges between two nodes indicating connectivity. The early works have achieved significant progress in short-term traffic forecasting, whose prediction horizon is within one hour.\nIn real-world ITS, there exists a considerable demand for prediction horizons that far exceed the typically short-term duration (usually $\\leq$ 1 hour) offered by prevailing deep learning methods. While SSTBAN [4] has initiated exploration into extended forecasting periods of 2 \u2013 4 hours, introducing a long-term traffic forecasting task, we propose an extra-long-term task with the prediction horizons ranging from 0.5 days to 1 week. In this real-world context, the traffic data incurs substantial computational and memory overheads due to the T \u00d7 N feature set. Almost all previous approaches to fusing and processing this data exhibit a critical limitation due to treating temporal and spatial dimensions distinctly. Separate processing paradigms for temporal and spatial dimensions necessitate"}, {"title": "Preliminary", "content": "Given traffic road network $G = (V, E)$, where V is the set of N nodes (i.e., monitoring stations) and E is the set of edges. An edge exists if two nodes are connected, from which we derive the adjacency matrix A. The historical traffic signal data are represented as $X = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_{T-1}] \\in R^{T\\times N\\times C}$, where T denotes the length of historical time steps, C represents the raw feature, with a value of 1 for a specific feature such as flow, speed or occupation.\nThe goal of traffic forecasting is to find a model F to predict the future traffic signal data $\\hat{Y} = [X_T, X_{T+1},..., X_{T+T'-1}]$, where T' is the length of future time steps, which can be formulated as:\n$X = [X_0, X_1,..., X_{T-1}] \\qquad (1)$\n$F(\\Theta), \\hat{Y} = [X_T, X_{T+1},..., X_{T+T'-1}]$"}, {"title": "Extralonger", "content": "We first introduce the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation in Section 3.1, followed by a step-by-step description of the architecture of Extralonger in Section 3.2."}, {"title": "Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation", "content": ""}, {"title": "Classical Representation", "content": "The pipeline with the classical representation $E \\in R^{T\\times N\\times D}$ for previous traffic forecasting models is illustrated at the top of Figure 2 and formulated as follows :\n$X \\in R^{T\\times N\\times C} \\xrightarrow{Linear(C)} E \\in R^{T\\times N\\times D} \\qquad (2)$\n$F(\\cdot|\\Theta), \\hat{Y} \\in R^{T' \\times N \\times C}$\nwhere D is the feature dimension. All current traffic forecasting methods, to the best of our knowledge, utilize the classical representation. They linearly project the raw data to the E, which serves as the input to the forecasting model F involving temporal and spatial modules. The combination of the two modules is summarized as temporal-first, spatial-first, and spatial-temporal simultaneous [6], as depicted by the gray bidirectional arrow in Figure 2.\nWe categorize prior methods into four main groups: RNN-based methods, attention-based methods, Transformer-based methods, and CNN-based methods. The former three groups of methods necessitate spatial iterations when processing temporal features, and require temporal iterations when processing spatial features. Essentially, while processing features for one dimension, the other dimension acts as a role of batch size. Consequently, the computational complexity of RNN-based methods is O(TN). Considering the diverse variants of attention-based and Transformer-based methods, we only give the complexity of the representative self-attention mechanism, i.e., O($NT^2 + TN^2$).\nMemory usage analysis is complex and depends on many factors beyond the scope of our paper, including the parallelization framework, optimizer type, and decisions regarding intermediate state maintenance [7].\nIgnoring the constant memory footprint of model parameters and optimizer state, we approximate memory usage as O(TN) for RNN-based methods and O($NT^2 + TN^2$) for attention-based and Transformer-based methods.\nEspecially, CNN-based methods [8, 9] can treat the spatial and temporal dimensions jointly. Similar to image data $R^{Height\\times Width\\times Channel}$ in computer vision, CNN-based methods correspondingly process the traffic data $R^{T\\times N\\times D}$. Therefore, the computational complexity of CNN-based methods follows the complexity of image processing, resulting in O($k^2TN$), where k denotes the kernel size. Since CNN-based methods leverage GNNs as the spatial module, the total complexity is O($k^2TN + TN$) for time complexity and O(TN) for memory usage.\nThese limitations of time and space complexity restrict the ability of existing methods to extend the prediction horizon to a weekly level. More details are given in Appendix C and Table 1."}, {"title": "New Representation", "content": "To address high-complexity issues, we rethink the classical representation and propose the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation. Since feature number C equals 1, we squeeze it directly. We adopt two fully connected linear layers and combine them with other prior embeddings (Section 3.2.1) to obtain the temporal and spatial representations: Et and Es. With these two representations, the new pipeline is shown at the bottom of Figure 2 and formulated as follows:\n$X\\in R^{T\\times N\\times C} \\xrightarrow{Squeeze(C)} R^{T\\times N} \\rightarrow E_t\\in R^{T\\times D} \\rightarrow F(\\Theta), \\hat{Y} \\in R^{T' \\times N}$         (3)\n$\\xrightarrow{Linear(N)} \\qquad \\qquad E_s \\in R^{N\\times D} \\xrightarrow{Linear(T)}$\nThe new representation integrates the whole nodes to the same time step directly and integrates all the time steps to the same node as the linear layers play a channel-mixed role. Hence, for every i in the range [0, T \u2013 1], each element in the set {$E_t[i, j] : j \\in [0, D \u2013 1]$} contains information about all the nodes at time step i. Similarly, for every n in the range [0, N \u2013 1], each element in the set {$E_s [n, m] : m \\in [0, D \u2013 1]$} contains information about all the time steps at node n. This operation reflects the idea of unification: each time step incorporates information from all nodes, while each node integrates information across all time steps, which contrasts with the classical representation that relies solely on the feature itself at a particular node and time step. Early methods that treat spatial and temporal dimensions separately require repetitive operations, leading to increased complexity. However, the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation overcomes this issue by reducing one dimension. Additionally, our novel representation offers the following three advantages.\nComplexity Reduction. The Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation inherently reduces computational complexity and memory usage compared to the classical representation. This stems from that one dimension less than the classical representation. This eliminates the need for repetitive operations across the other dimension. Since our model employs a Transformer-based architecture denoted as F, the time complexity decreases from O($NT^2 + TN^2$) to O($T^2 + N^2$). Notably, if incorporating efficient attention mechanisms [10], the computational complexity could be further reduced to O(TlogT + NlogN). Similarly, memory usage reduces from O($NT^2 + TN^2$) to O($T^2 + N^2$).\nSimultaneous Aggregation. The traffic signal transmits between the upstream nodes and the downstream nodes with time going by, so the signal is related to different nodes and different times, not just fixing one dimension and varying another one. Extralonger allows each node to be simultaneously linked to all other nodes at the current time step, as well as to the nodes from all historical and future time steps. This representation enables Extralonger to effectively capture the complex spatial-temporal dynamics underlying traffic trends. Conversely, RNN-based, attention-based and Transformer-based methods can only aggregate the nodes at the same time step or the same node among different time steps. Treating traffic data as a grid, CNN-based methods are unable to simultaneously consider all nodes at the same time step. Instead, they can only aggregate the nodes within adjacent time steps due to the inherent receptive field. The aggregation comparison of ours and other methods is shown in Figure 3(a).\nComplete Receptive Field. The importance of a complete receptive field from both spatial and temporal dimensions for capturing long-range dependencies in traffic forecasting has been well-established in prior work [6, 9, 11]. Extralonger achieves a complete receptive field compared to existing approaches. This stems from the inherent characteristic of the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation and the self-attention mechanism employed by Extralonger. As illustrated in the three-route Transformer architecture in Section 3.2, the self-attention mechanism enables comprehensive connectivity among all elements in the sets {$E_t [i, :] : i \\in [0, T \u2013 1]$} and {$E_s[n, :] : n \\in [0, N \u2013 1]$}."}, {"title": "Architecture of Extralonger", "content": "Founded on the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation, we propose Extralonger, comprising three parts: embedding layer, three-route Transformer, and prediction layer, as shown in Figure 1. The embedding layer transforms the raw traffic data into an embedding space. The resulting embedding consists of two components, the spatial representation Es and the temporal representation Et. The three-route Transformer is the heart of Extralonger and is comprised of three parallel routes: a temporal route, a spatial route, and a mixed route. Notably, all three routes can simultaneously process information from both spatial and temporal dimensions due to the adoption of the Unified Spatial-Temporal Representation. Each route emphasizes specific aspects of the data. The temporal Transformer in the temporal route and the mixed route is implemented as a standard Transformer encoder, and its detailed description is omitted for brevity. The Global-Local Spatial Transformer is specifically designed for the spatial route and the mixed route. Finally, projected by the prediction layer first, the outputs of the three routes are added up with a hand-crafted weight."}, {"title": "Embedding Layer", "content": "We first inject noise into X with learnable parameters (More details in Appendix E). Then, we use two fully connected linear layers to transform X to feature embeddings: $E_{tf} \\in R^{T\\times d_{tf}}$ and $E_{sf} \\in R^{N\\times d_{sf}}$. We also utilize learnable embedding to capture the periodicity. Specifically, we employ $E_{tod} \\in R^{T\\times d_{tod}}$ for the 24-hour cycle (namely, timestamp-of-day embedding) and $E_{dow} \\in R^{T\\times d_{dow}}$ for the 7-day cycle (namely, day-of-week embedding). We adopt a learnable spatial embedding $E_{spatial} \\in R^{N\\times d_{spatial}}$, introduced by GWNet [8], to capture the spatial dynamics. The temporal representation Et is formed by concatenating the aforementioned embeddings: $E_t =$"}, {"title": "Global-Local Spatial Transformer", "content": "The proposed Global-Local Spatial Transformer is specifically tailored to exploit the inherent topological characteristics of the spatial domain. It integrates the road network's prior information into the self-attention mechanism. By incorporating dynamic dependencies derived from all nodes and focusing on neighboring nodes to aggregate local correlations, the Global-Local Spatial Transformer explicitly leverages both global and local spatial information, as shown in Figure 4. More details about motivation and insights are given in Appendix D.\nGiven $Q = E_sW_Q, K = E_sW_K, V = E_sW_V$, where $W_Q$, $W_K$ and $W_V$ are learnable parameters, the Global-Attention score before softmax is followed as:\n$A_{global}(Q, K) = \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{D}}$       (4)\nThen, we inject the road network's prior information by using the adjacency matrix A as a mask to obtain the Local-Attention score before softmax, formulated as:\n$\\hat{A}_{local} = \\hat{A}_{global} \\odot A$        (5)\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes the element-wise product. We designate it as local because only information from adjacent nodes is considered, while non-adjacent nodes are masked out. Both $\\hat{A}_{local}$ and $\\hat{A}_{global}$ are subjected to a softmax function to obtain normalized attention weights. Global-Local Spatial Attention (GLSAtt) is obtained by weighted summation with V.\n$GLSAtt = \\frac{(Softmax(\\hat{A}_{local}) + Softmax(\\hat{A}_{global}))}{2}V$       (6)\nWe sequentially apply layer normalization (LN), skip connections, and a feed-forward network (FFN), the same procedure as the vanilla Transformer, to yield the output $\\hat{E_s}$.\n$Z = LN(GLSAtt(E_s)) + E_s$       (7)\n$\\hat{E} = LN(FFN(Z)) + Z$      (8)"}, {"title": "Prediction Layer", "content": "We employ linear layers to project the output of the three-route Transformer to predict the corresponding T' time steps, which is necessary for the asymmetrical T \u2013 T' setup.

The sole exception is memory usage in the 12-step scenario, where the CNN-based method DMSTGCN achieves a marginally lower cost.

They acknowledge the inherent challenge of data validity in traffic forecasting. Data augmentation technique is a possible way to improve robustness. However, traditional data augmentation techniques commonly used in computer vision (CV) [42], such as cropping, scaling, and rotation, are not well-suited for traffic data due to their inherent sequential nature and strong self-correlations. Additionally, complex deep learning methods like VAEs [43] and GANs [44] might be overly elaborate for this specific task.\nTo mitigate the impact of noise, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy involving the injection of learnable noise into the input data, which is implemented by the learnable parameter initialized with Xavier uniform distribution. We use this learnable noise embedding to imitate the impulse noise and enhance the model's robustness against real-world noise patterns. The result of the ablation experiment validates the effectiveness of this technique (Section 4.6)."}, {"title": "Details of Datasets and Setup", "content": "Both PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets are collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System [41] at a 5-minute sampling frequency.

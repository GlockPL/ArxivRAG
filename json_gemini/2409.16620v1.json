INTRODUCTION", "content": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm used extensively in decision-making processes, par-ticularly in domains like game playing, robotics, and optimiza-tion problems [1]. Its strength lies in its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, constructing a search tree that guides optimal action selection.\nThis paper focuses on optimizing MCTS for the FrozenLake environment, a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning characterized by its stochastic and slippery dynamics. In FrozenLake, an agent must navigate a grid to reach a goal while avoiding hidden pitfalls, requiring intelligent decision-making under uncertainty.\nThe primary goal of this study is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of MCTS in stochastic environments by inte-grating cumulative reward and visit count tables, denoted as Q and N, respectively. These tables facilitate faster convergence by retaining valuable information from previous explorations. Additionally, we employ the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) formula to maintain a strategic balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known rewarding actions.\nTo validate our approach, we benchmark the optimized MCTS against two other algorithms: MCTS with Policy and Q-Learning. This comparative analysis highlights the advan-tages of our optimized approach in terms of learning efficiency, performance stability, and execution time."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Monte Carlo Tree Search has been extensively studied and applied across various domains. Browne et al. [1] provide a comprehensive survey of MCTS methods, highlighting its applications in game playing, robotics, and decision-making under uncertainty. The foundational UCT algorithm introduced by Kocsis and Szepesv\u00e1ri [2] introduced a mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, which has been pivotal in MCTS advancements.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, such as Q-Learning [3], have also been widely used for decision-making tasks. Unlike MCTS, which builds a search tree based on simulations, Q-Learning focuses on learning a value function to guide action selection. While Q-Learning is effective in deterministic environments, its performance can degrade in highly stochastic settings like FrozenLake.\nThe FrozenLake environment, part of OpenAI Gym [4], serves as a benchmark for evaluating RL algorithms in stochas-tic settings. Previous studies have applied both MCTS and Q-Learning to FrozenLake, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each approach. However, there remains a gap in optimizing MCTS specifically for such environments to enhance its performance and reliability."}, {"title": "III.

Optimized MCTS Framework", "content": "The optimized MCTS operates through iterative simulations, building a search tree that represents possible state-action trajectories. The use of Q and N tables allows the algorithm to retain and update information about the cumulative rewards and the number of times each action has been explored in a given state. This memory mechanism enhances the algorithm's ability to make informed decisions based on historical perfor-mance data.\nThe UCT formula is central to balancing exploration and exploitation.

The agent required fewer steps per episode (about 30 steps) to converge, but its overall performance in terms of success rate and reward was inferior.\n\u2022 Q-Learning demonstrated slower initial progress but eventually stabilized around an average reward of 0.8 and a success rate of 60% after 40,000 episodes. Its execution time was similar to Optimized MCTS at 42.74 seconds but required more steps per episode (about 50 steps)."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm in solving the FrozenLake environment. By utilizing cumulative reward and visit count tables alongside the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) formula, the algorithm successfully learns a policy that maximizes the agent's rewards and success rate while minimizing the number of steps required per episode.\nThe results show that the agent stabilizes around an average reward of 0.8 and a success rate of 70%, with a consistent convergence rate of 40 steps per episode. These metrics reflect the robustness of the optimized MCTS in managing explo-ration and exploitation in stochastic environments. Compared to MCTS with Policy and Q-Learning, the optimized approach offers significant improvements in performance and learning efficiency while maintaining competitive execution times.\nFuture work could explore enhancing the exploration phase through techniques like adaptive exploration constants or inte-grating model-based strategies to further improve the agent's success rate and reduce performance fluctuations."}]}

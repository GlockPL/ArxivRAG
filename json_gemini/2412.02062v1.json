According to statistics, the proportion of the global elderly population continues to rise. By 2050, the population aged 60 and above will account for 22% of the worldwide population. This trend brings many challenges. In particular, in the context of limited medical resources and insufficient elderly care services, how to predict the health behaviors of the elderly through scientific and effective methods and take preventive measures promptly has become an urgent problem to be solved in many fields such as public health, social security, and smart elderly care. The prediction of the health behaviors of the elderly is not only related to improving individual health and quality of life but also has important significance for reducing medical costs and alleviating family and social burdens."}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "As an important part of smart elderly care, health behavior prediction for the elderly has received extensive attention and in-depth research in recent years. The progress of related work is mainly concentrated in the following aspects: improvement of traditional health behavior prediction methods, health monitoring systems based on the Internet of Things, and health behavior prediction in smart elderly care."}, {"title": "Traditional health behavior prediction methods", "content": "In the early research on predicting the health behavior of the elderly, traditional methods [39, 40, 41] mainly relied on questionnaires, health examinations, and expert evaluations. These methods collect basic health data of the elderly, such as blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, etc., and combine their living habits and medical history to assess health risks and predict possible health problems. However, these traditional methods face many challenges. First, these methods are highly dependent on the participation and cooperation of the elderly themselves. The data collection process is usually complicated and the amount of data is limited. This static data cannot fully reflect the dynamic changes in the health status of the elderly, resulting in insufficient timeliness and accuracy of the prediction [42, 43, 44, 45]. Second, traditional methods make it difficult to quantify individual differences, especially when facing a diverse elderly population, and it is difficult to provide personalized health management plans. In addition, methods such as health examinations and questionnaires often require high human and material resources are not sustainable, and cannot be promoted on a large scale. Nevertheless, traditional methods laid the foundation for early research on the health of the elderly and provided a reference for subsequent research. With the advancement of data collection technology and analysis methods, researchers have gradually realized the need to combine emerging technologies to make up for the shortcomings of traditional methods, to achieve more accurate and real-time health behavior prediction."}, {"title": "Health monitoring system based on internet of things", "content": "The development of IoT technology [46] has brought new opportunities for monitoring and predicting the health behavior of the elderly. In recent years, researchers have increasingly used IoT devices for real-time health monitoring, such as smart bracelets, smart homes, and wearable sensors. These devices can collect physiological data and daily activity data of the elderly in real-time, and transmit the data to the cloud for analysis through wireless networks, thereby realizing dynamic monitoring of health status [47, 48, 49, 50, 51]. Health monitoring systems based on IoT have many advantages. First, these systems can collect data in real-time and discover changing trends in the health status of the elderly through data analysis. For example, smart bracelets can monitor data such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature of the elderly in real-time and immediately issue an alarm when an abnormality is detected. Similarly, smart home systems can identify potential health risks by monitoring the daily activities of the elderly, such as getting up, eating, and going out. Second, the data collection process of IoT devices [52, 53, 54, 55, 56] is usually automated, reducing the reliance on the active participation of the elderly and ensuring the continuity and integrity of the data. In addition, the data collected by IoT devices can be combined with other data sources (such as electronic medical records, medication records, etc.) to achieve more comprehensive health behavior prediction [27, 24]. However, health monitoring systems based on IoT also face some challenges. For example, how to effectively process and analyze a large amount of heterogeneous data is a key issue. Different types of IoT devices may generate data in different formats. The fusion and analysis of these data require powerful data processing capabilities and advanced algorithm support. In addition, data privacy and security are also issues that cannot be ignored. How to achieve data sharing and analysis while ensuring data security and user privacy is one of the important directions of current research."}, {"title": "Prediction of health behavior in smart elderly care", "content": "Smart elderly care is a new elderly care model that combines information technology, artificial intelligence, and elderly care services. Its core goal is to improve the quality of life and safety of the elderly through technical means. In the framework of smart elderly care, health behavior prediction plays a vital role. Through real-time analysis and prediction of daily behavior data of the elderly, the smart elderly care system can provide personalized health management services for the elderly, reduce health risks, and improve the quality of life. Health behavior prediction in smart elderly care covers multiple fields, including fall prediction, chronic disease management, emotional state monitoring, etc. [57, 58]. For example, falls are a common and serious health problem for the elderly. Using machine learning and deep learning technologies, researchers have developed a variety of fall detection and prediction systems. These systems can identify the risk of falls in advance by analyzing the gait, posture, and movement patterns of the elderly, and issue alarms to reduce the incidence of accidents. For example, based on data from wearable devices, researchers can analyze the gait of the elderly through convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) models to predict potential fall risks [59, 60].\nIn addition, chronic disease management is also an important application area in smart elderly care. By monitoring the daily activities and physiological data of the elderly, the smart elderly care system can promptly identify early signs of chronic disease onset and provide personalized intervention measures. For example, using IoT devices and big data analysis technology, researchers can monitor indicators such as blood sugar levels and heart rate changes of the elderly, and combine historical data to predict risks, thereby helping medical personnel to develop more accurate treatment plans. Emotional state monitoring is also an emerging direction in smart elderly care in recent years. The mental health of the elderly is also crucial, and fluctuations in emotional state may have a significant impact on their overall health. By analyzing the elderly's voice, facial expressions, and social activity data, the smart elderly care system can assess their emotional state and provide psychological counseling and support when abnormalities are detected. These technical means based on artificial intelligence and data analysis provide more comprehensive and personalized health management services for the elderly [61, 62, 63].\nIn summary, as an important part of smart elderly care, the prediction of the health behavior of the elderly has made significant research progress. Traditional health behavior prediction methods have laid the foundation for research, but they are insufficient in the face of dynamic changes and personalized needs. The health monitoring system based on the Internet of Things provides a real-time and comprehensive means of data collection, but how to effectively process and analyze this data remains a challenge. Health behavior prediction in smart elderly care covers multiple application areas, and through advanced technical means, it provides personalized health management services for the elderly. Future research will further explore the application of multi-source data fusion technology to improve the accuracy and reliability of health behavior prediction, and solve problems such as data privacy and security, to provide a more comprehensive solution for the health management of the elderly."}, {"title": "METHODOLOGY", "content": ""}, {"title": "Related theories", "content": "In the design and implementation of the smart elderly care platform, the selection and application of theoretical foundations are crucial. To ensure that the platform can effectively meet the needs of the elderly, this study combines theories from multiple fields such as geriatrics, health behavior, Internet of Things technology, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence [64, 65] and applies these theories to the design, data processing, and decision support of the platform.\nThe elderly population has unique needs in terms of physiological, psychological and social characteristics. Physiologically, the elderly's body functions gradually decline, they are prone to chronic diseases, and their ability to adapt to the external environment decreases. Psychologically, the elderly are prone to loneliness and anxiety, and their emotional needs are more prominent. Socially, the elderly's social circle is relatively small, and they rely on the support system of family and community. Therefore, when designing a smart elderly care platform, these characteristics of the elderly population must be fully considered to ensure that the platform can provide services that meet actual needs. To cope with these characteristics of the elderly population, the platform design is based on the Healthy Aging theory [66]. This theory emphasizes delaying the process of health decline and improving the quality of life of the elderly through preventive health management, personalized care, and active social participation. Specifically in the implementation of the platform, the Healthy Aging theory guides us to design functional modules such as real-time health monitoring, psychological care, and social support, to provide comprehensive health management services for the elderly.\nHealth behavior theory provides theoretical support for the prediction of health behavior of the elderly. Health behavior research shows that health behavior is affected by multiple factors such as personal physiology, psychology, social environment, and behavioral habits. These factors interact with each other and jointly determine the occurrence and change of health behavior. Taking the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [67] as an example, this theory believes that an individual's behavioral intention is influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, which are the key to behavior change. In the smart elderly care platform, health behavior theory is used to guide the design of behavior prediction models [68, 69]. By collecting physiological data, activity data, and psychological state data of the elderly, the platform can comprehensively evaluate the influencing factors of their health behavior and predict possible health risks. The platform uses health behavior theory to integrate these factors into the prediction model, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of the prediction. For example, the platform can predict possible falls or abnormal health events of the elderly based on their behavioral intentions and daily activity patterns, and provide corresponding warnings and intervention suggestions.\nThe core of the smart elderly care platform lies in the collection and analysis of data, so the IoT and big data theory occupy an important position in the construction of the platform. The Internet of Things theory supports the collection and transmission of health behavior data of the elderly. Through smart devices and sensor networks, the platform can monitor the physiological indicators, behavior patterns, and environmental conditions of the elderly in real time. The data is transmitted to the cloud or edge computing devices through the Internet of Things system for processing, realizing dynamic analysis, and real-time feedback of health data. Big data theory provides a basis for the storage, processing, and analysis of data. The platform's data sources are extensive, including real-time data from smart devices, historical health records, and social and psychological status data. Through big data technology, the platform can effectively process these massive and diverse data and extract high-value health behavior characteristics. At the same time, based on big data analysis theory, the platform can identify complex associations hidden in the data and generate personalized health predictions and management plans.\nIn addition, the platform also combines expert systems and decision support theories and uses AI algorithms to provide scientific health management suggestions for the elderly and caregivers. By learning the health patterns of the elderly population, the platform automatically generates personalized care plans and provides emotional care and social support. This AI-based decision support system can not only improve the accuracy of health management but also significantly enhance the user experience of the platform."}, {"title": "Smart elderly care service model", "content": "The core of the smart elderly care service model is to achieve all-around support for the elderly population through effective resource allocation, accurate health behavior prediction, and reasonable cost-benefit analysis. To build this model, we combined the theoretical foundations of multiple disciplines and described them through mathematical formulas to ensure that the model is operational in practice and rigorous in theory. The overall framework is shown in Figure 1. The main goal of smart elderly care is to provide comprehensive health management services for the elderly through information technology and intelligent means, including daily health monitoring, emergency warnings, chronic disease management, and quality of life improvement. In this context, our model first starts from the three core perspectives of resource allocation, dynamic changes in health behavior, and cost-benefit analysis to ensure that the system can effectively respond to the diverse needs of the elderly population."}, {"title": "Resource allocation and optimization", "content": "In smart elderly care services, the optimal allocation of resources is the key to maximizing the effect of health management. Resource allocation issues usually involve multiple participants, such as the government, social capital, medical institutions, and elderly families. When resources are limited, how to allocate resources to maximize health benefits is the primary issue in model design. Assume that the allocation of resources $R_i$ follows the following utility function:\n\n$U_i(R_i) = \\frac{a_i R_i^{\\theta_i}}{1 + b_i R_i^{\\theta_i}}$ (1)\n\namong them, $a_i$ and $b_i$ are utility coefficients, $\\theta_i$ and $\\delta_i$ are utility indices. This utility function reflects the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns of resource allocation, that is, as resource input increases, the increase in utility gradually decreases. When resource allocation reaches a certain level, the effect of continuing to increase resource input will become insignificant. This feature is particularly important in smart elderly care, because resources (such as funds, medical equipment, nursing staff, etc.) are usually limited, so they need to be reasonably allocated to maximize the overall benefit. In practical applications, the solution of the utility function can be achieved through optimization algorithms such as the Lagrange multiplier method. By solving the maximum value of the utility function, the system can determine the optimal resource allocation strategy for each participant. This strategy can be dynamically adjusted according to variables such as the health status, social support, and environmental factors of the elderly to ensure the effective use of resources."}, {"title": "Dynamic changes in health behaviors", "content": "The health status of the elderly is not only closely related to resource input but also affected by their daily behavior, psychological state, social support, and external environment. To model these complex factors, we introduced the dynamic change equation of health behavior. Assume that the change of the health status $H(t)$ of the elderly over time $t$ can be described by the following differential equation:\n\n$\\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = \\alpha_1\\cdot S(t) + \\alpha_2\\cdot P(t) + \\alpha_3\\cdot E(t) - \\beta \\cdot C(t)$ (2)\n\nin this equation, $S(t)$ represents the intensity of social support, $P(t)$ represents the psychological state, $E(t)$ represents the influence of environmental factors, and $C(t)$ represents the cost of health behavior. Parameters $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$ represent the positive effects of different factors on health status, and $\\beta$ represents the negative effect of cost on health status. This equation can be numerically solved to obtain the trajectory of changes in the health status of the elderly. This model is particularly suitable for predicting the evolution of long-term health behaviors, such as the cumulative impact of long-term exercise and healthy diet on the health status of the elderly. Through this model, the smart elderly care service platform can provide personalized health management advice for the elderly and take intervention measures at the early stage of health deterioration."}, {"title": "Interactions between environmental factors and health status", "content": "To further characterize the complex relationship between the health behavior of the elderly and the external environment, we introduce external environmental factors into the dynamic change equation of health behavior. Assuming that the health state of the elderly $H(t)$ is affected by the external environment $E(t)$, this can be described by the following equation:\n\n$\\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = \\alpha\\cdot \\frac{R_h(t)}{1 + \\kappa E(t)} - \\beta\\cdot C(t)$ (3)\n\nwhere, $R_h(t)$ represents the resources obtained by the elderly, and $\\kappa$ is the inhibition coefficient of the environment on health status. The equation shows that as the environment deteriorates (such as air pollution, noise pollution climate change, etc.), the improvement of the health status of the elderly will be inhibited. This means that in harsh environments, more resources are needed to maintain the health status of the elderly. To alleviate this impact, the smart elderly care service platform can combine environmental monitoring data to dynamically adjust the health management strategy of the elderly population. For example, during periods of severe air pollution, the platform can advise the elderly to reduce outdoor activities and provide them with appropriate indoor exercise plans. At the same time, the platform can also monitor environmental data in real-time through smart devices and automatically adjust resource allocation according to environmental changes."}, {"title": "Dynamic resource allocation and health management", "content": "In the process of providing health management services, the smart elderly care platform needs to dynamically adjust the resource allocation strategy according to the changes in the health status of the elderly.

Assume that the total benefit $E(T)$ of smart elderly care services can be decomposed into the weighted sum of health benefits, social benefits, and economic benefits:\n\n$E(T) = \\gamma_1\\cdot E_h(T) + \\gamma_2\\cdot E_s(T) + \\gamma_3 \\cdot E_e(T)$ (6)\n\nAt the same time, the total cost of the system $B(T)$ can be decomposed into the weighted sum of direct cost, operating cost, and maintenance cost:\n\n$B(T) = \\lambda_1 \\cdot C_d + \\lambda_2 \\cdot C_o + \\lambda_3 \\cdot C_m$ (7)\n\nTherefore, the cost-benefit ratio (CBR) can be expressed as:\n\n$CBR = \\frac{E(T)}{B(T)}$ (8)\n\nBy analyzing the cost-benefit ratio in different scenarios, the platform can dynamically adjust the resource allocation strategy to maximize benefits. For example, when resources are sufficient, the platform can prioritize health benefits; when resources are tight, the system can be kept running efficiently by optimizing operation and maintenance costs.\nThrough the above platform, we can comprehensively model resource allocation, health status evolution, and the role of social capital in the smart elderly care service model. Each formula represents the adjustment mechanism of the platform to deal with different scenarios during actual operation. Through these mathematical models, the platform can achieve dynamic management and personalized services for the elderly population, thereby effectively improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health management. These models can be further extended to complex scenarios. For example, in a multi-player game model,"}, {"title": "EXPERIMENT", "content": ""}, {"title": "Difficulties in predicting health behaviors of the elderly", "content": "In the process of building a smart elderly care service platform, the prediction of the health behavior of the elderly is a key link. However, due to the particularity of the elderly population and the complexity of their health conditions, health behavior prediction faces many challenges and difficulties [70, 71, 72]. The following are several major difficulties.\nData diversity and heterogeneity. The health behaviors of the elderly are affected by many factors, including physiological, psychological, social, and environmental factors. To accurately predict health behaviors, the platform needs to integrate multi-source data, such as physiological data from wearable devices, activity data from smart home devices, medical records, mental health assessments, and data from environmental sensors. These data not only come from diverse sources, but also have different formats, frequencies, and accuracies, and are highly heterogeneous. How to effectively integrate these diverse data and eliminate noise and redundant information is a major challenge in prediction.\nComplexity and individual differences in health status. The health status of the elderly is often complex and highly individual. Even in similar age groups, there may be significant differences in physical function, medical history, lifestyle, and coping mechanisms. In addition, as they age, the decline of physical function and the onset of diseases in the elderly are often irregular and unpredictable. Health behavior prediction models need to be able to capture these complexities and differences to accurately predict individual health behaviors. However, traditional prediction methods are often based on group statistical models, which make it difficult to accurately model individuals.\nLong-term dependency and data loss issues. Predicting the health behavior of the elderly requires modeling and analysis based on long-term historical data. However, in practical applications, it is not easy to obtain long-term data. On the one hand, the health status of the elderly may be unstable or the improper use of technical equipment, resulting in discontinuous data records; on the other hand, the elderly may have incomplete data collection due to cognitive decline or low technology acceptance. In addition, the data of the elderly group may also be affected by multiple factors such as socioeconomic status, cultural background, and living environment, further increasing the complexity and missing problems of the data.\nThe suddenness and nonlinearity of behavioral changes. The health behavior and health status of the elderly may change suddenly, such as sudden falls, acute illness attacks, or sharp fluctuations in emotional states. This suddenness and nonlinearity make prediction more difficult. Traditional prediction methods usually rely on the stationary and linear assumptions of data, but they are often powerless in the face of the highly nonlinear and unpredictable health behavior of the elderly. Therefore, the prediction model needs to have strong flexibility and robustness to cope with these sudden changes.\nData privacy and ethical issues. Elderly health data usually involves sensitive personal information, such as health status, behavioral habits, emotional state, etc. How to protect the privacy and data security of the elderly during data collection, storage, and analysis is an important ethical issue. In addition, in data-driven prediction models, how to ensure the fairness of the algorithm and avoid discrimination or wrong decisions caused by data bias is also a challenge that needs to be solved urgently. To cope with the above difficulties, this study comprehensively considered multi-source data fusion, personalized modeling, data missing processing, nonlinear prediction methods, and privacy protection mechanisms in the experimental design to build a model that can accurately and real-time predict the health behavior of the elderly. Next, the specific design of the experiment, the data processing process and the implementation of the model will be described in detail."}, {"title": "Implementation details", "content": "Dynamic Data Collection. The proposed elderly health behavior prediction platform integrates real-time data collection using IoT devices, such as wearable health monitors, smart home sensors, and environmental sensors. These devices continuously capture dynamic health indicators (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, movement patterns) and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality). The data is transmitted in real-time to a central server via secure wireless communication protocols. This dynamic data collection enables the system to continuously monitor changes in health status, capturing both gradual trends and sudden fluctuations, thus supporting timely intervention.\nFeedback Mechanisms. The platform incorporates an adaptive feedback mechanism on multiple levels: user feedback, family and caregiver alerts, and healthcare provider notifications. When a potential health risk is detected, the system immediately alerts relevant stakeholders via mobile apps, SMS, or emails. For the elderly user, personalized feedback is delivered through a user-friendly interface, including daily health reports, reminders for medication or physical activity, and warnings about potential health risks. Caregivers and healthcare providers receive summaries of abnormal patterns, along with recommended interventions based on historical data and current health status. This continuous feedback loop ensures that all stakeholders are informed in real-time, enabling proactive management of the elderly's health.\nControl Algorithms. The platform employs advanced control algorithms that dynamically adjust health recommendations and alerts based on the individual's ongoing health status and historical data. These control algorithms are built using rule-based systems combined with predictive models to ensure responsiveness and adaptability. For example, if a significant drop in activity levels is detected alongside a rise in heart rate, the control algorithm will flag this combination as a potential health risk and escalate the level of alerts. Moreover, the system periodically retrains these algorithms using new data to improve accuracy and relevance, adapting to the changing needs and conditions of the elderly individual. By incorporating both automated adjustments and clinician-configurable thresholds, the control algorithms provide a balance between user customization and system-driven optimization.\nRevised Evaluation Strategy. To effectively assess the platform's real-world applicability and effectiveness, the evaluation process includes extensive testing under real-life conditions. Continuous data from various elderly users is analyzed to assess the accuracy of health predictions, the timeliness of feedback, and the relevance of control adjustments. Additionally, stakeholder feedback is gathered regularly to refine the feedback mechanisms and control algorithms further. This real-world testing provides essential insights into the platform's adaptability, scalability, and reliability, ensuring it can meet the demands of dynamic and complex elderly care environments."}, {"title": "Model design and experimental results analysis", "content": "To address various challenges in predicting the health behavior of the elderly and verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, this study designed and implemented a complete health behavior prediction service model for the elderly. The model aims to address challenges such as data diversity and heterogeneity, complexity and individual differences in health status, long-term dependence, and data loss, sudden and nonlinear behavior changes, and data privacy and ethical issues."}, {"title": "Design of service model for the elderly", "content": "Data collection. Considering the diversity and heterogeneity of data, the model first collects multi-source data in real-time through IoT devices (such as wearable devices, smart home sensors, etc.). These data include physiological parameters of the elderly (such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, etc.), daily activities (such as steps, sleep patterns, etc.), psychological states (such as emotions, stress levels, etc.), environmental information (such as air quality, temperature and humidity, etc.), and medical records (such as medical history, medication information, etc.). To solve the problem of data heterogeneity, we use multimodal data fusion technology to standardize and fuse data from different sources to form a unified feature representation. Specifically, we use a fusion network based on the attention mechanism to extract key health behavior features by weighting and merging the importance of different data sources.\nData missing processing and robustness enhancement module. To address the long-term dependency and data missing issues, we integrated data interpolation and robustness enhancement algorithms into the model. For short-term data missing, we used an interpolation method based on Gaussian processes to infer missing values and complete the data. For long-term data missing, we used a self-supervised learning framework to improve the model's robustness to missing data by constructing comparative learning tasks, ensuring that prediction accuracy is not affected by data missing.\nPrivacy protection and security module. Considering data privacy and ethical issues, the model is designed with special attention to data security and privacy protection. We use federated learning technology to train data on local devices, avoid uploading data to the cloud, and reduce the risk of privacy leakage. In addition, through the differential privacy mechanism, we ensure that during the data analysis and model training process, even if the data is maliciously accessed, no specific personal information can be obtained.\nMarket research analysis and data-driven decision-making. Before model design, this study conducted detailed market research to understand the gap between current market demand and existing smart elderly care services and guided the model design in a data-driven manner. By analyzing market research data, model functions can be optimized to ensure that they meet user needs. Table 1 summarizes the importance of different functions in market research and the comparison of their availability in the current market. As shown in Table 1, real-time monitoring and prediction accuracy are the functions that users care about most, but there is still much room for improvement in their availability in the market."}, {"title": "Experimental results and analysis", "content": "The experimental results show that the proposed health behavior prediction model performs well in multiple dimensions. With the support of data fusion and missing data processing, the model demonstrates efficient prediction capabilities in a multimodal data environment. At the same time, through the nonlinear prediction and emergency detection modules, the model performs well in dealing with sudden changes in health status. Figure 1 shows the comparison between the importance of functions in market research and the current availability, reflecting the functional gaps in the current market. As shown in Figure 2, although real-time monitoring and prediction accuracy are of high importance, their availability in the current market is not ideal, indicating that there is a lot of room for improvement.\nIn the analysis of health status service coverage, as shown in Figure 3, there are significant differences in service coverage under different health statuses. Especially in high-risk groups such as cardiovascular disease, the service coverage still needs to be further improved to meet actual needs.\nIn addition, the line graph of the importance and implementation difficulty of platform functions (as shown in Figure 4) reveals the trade-off between the importance and implementation difficulty of different functions during system design. Figure 4 shows that data security and interoperability are of high importance, but are also relatively difficult to implement, reminding us that we need to focus on overcoming these technical difficulties during the design process.\nThe health prediction results in the experiment were further verified by visual analysis. Figure 5 shows a scatter plot of the health status predicted by the model and the actual health status. The red dotted line in Figure 5 represents the situation where the prediction under the ideal state is consistent with the actual value. The results show that most of the prediction points are close to the dotted line, indicating that the model performs well in prediction accuracy.\nFinally, Figure 6 shows the historical trend of changes in the health status of an elderly person during the experiment. Through the time series analysis of health status, it can be found that the model can capture the changing trend of health status promptly and make predictions and adjustments at key nodes to ensure that the elderly receive timely health interventions."}, {"title": "Extended Experiment", "content": "To comprehensively evaluate its applicability and accuracy in different elderly populations, we designed multiple environments to test the health status of different elderly populations.\n1) Urban vs. rural environment\nExperimental design: Sample selection: 500 elderly people in urban and rural areas were selected.

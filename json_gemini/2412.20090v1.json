{"title": "FROM WORMS TO MICE: HOMEOSTASIS MAYBE ALL YOU NEED", "authors": ["Jesus Marco de Lucas"], "abstract": "In this brief and speculative commentary, we explore ideas inspired by neural networks in machine learning, proposing that a simple neural XOR motif, involving both excitatory and inhibitory connections, may provide the basis for a relevant mode of plasticity in neural circuits of living organisms, with homeostasis as the sole guiding principle. This XOR motif simply signals the discrepancy between incoming signals and reference signals, thereby providing a basis for a loss function in learning neural circuits, and at the same time regulating homeostasis by halting the propagation of these incoming signals. The core motif uses a 4:1 ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons, and supports broader neural patterns such as the well-known 'winner takes all' (WTA) mechanism. We examined the prevalence of the XOR motif in the published connectomes of various organisms with increasing complexity, and found that it ranges from tens (in C. elegans) to millions (in several Drosophila neuropils) and more than tens of millions (in mouse V1 visual cortex). If validated, our hypothesis identifies two of the three key components in analogy to machine learning models: the architecture and the loss function. And we propose that a relevant type of biological neural plasticity is simply driven by a basic control or regulatory system, which has persisted and adapted despite the increasing complexity of organisms throughout evolution.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "IHomeostasis is a general term that can be defined as \"the ability or tendency of a living organism, cell, or group to maintain the conditions within it at the same level despite changes in the conditions around it, or this state of internal balance\" [1] However, in the context of neuroscience, in addition to conditions at key levels such as intracellular Ca concentration, the term also refers to the equilibrium achieved in the propagation of electrical and chemical activity, preventing unstable conditions such as neural hyperactivity. In a previous short commentary[2], we presented a basic neural motif composed of a few excitatory neurons and one inhibitory neuron, corresponding to C. Elegans, and showed that it can implement an XOR switch, i.e. such that when it compares two input signals, its output is non-zero only if these signals are different. We also described how such an XOR motif can be used in a computational neural network as the core of a basic autoencoder, and trained using the so-called Liquid Time Constants (LTC) neural network framework[3]. In this new note, we extend the previous implementation to the case of spiking neurons, and explore in more detail the presence of this XOR motif in different organisms using the available open data for their connectomes. First, we examine the C. elegans connectome again, but requiring the explicit XOR motif to inhibit connections. Then we look at the recently published connectomes of the different Drosophila neuropils. Finally, we also examine the connectome describing the V1 visual cortex in mice. We conclude by discussing the potential relevance of this very simple XOR motif as a core piece for configuring biologically viable computational neural networks."}, {"title": "The XOR motif in spiking neural networks", "content": "We introduced a basic neural motif using C. elegans neurons that implements an XOR switch in a previous note [2]. The scheme is shown in Figure 1: two excitatory neurons, El and E3, are each connected to two other excitatory neurons, E2 and E4, but also to an inhibitory interneuron, INH, which is also connected to E2 and E4; these two neurons provide the input to a final neuron, which provides the XOR output.\nWe have implemented a similar scheme but with spiking neurons using the Brian2 platform[4]. To contrast the performance as an XOR switch, we simulated two different pulse trains and used them as input to two sensory neurons coupled to the XOR motif. This XOR motif contains four excitatory neurons, one inhibitory neuron and one output neuron. Figure 2 shows how these pulse trains produce the corresponding spiking pulses in the output neuron following the XOR pattern."}, {"title": "XOR Motif in C. Elegans", "content": "In this section, we review and extend previous findings regarding the presence and relevance of the XOR motif in the connectome of C. Elegans [2]. We utilized reference data from the adult hermaphrodite connectome[7], available as an adjacency matrix in the WormWiring platform[8], which includes 3.707 directed chemical synaptic connections among neurons. From this dataset, we compiled a table of the 300 neurons involved in these connections and assigned a putative role (excitatory, inhibitory, or other) to each neuron based on its associated neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter data was derived from the WormAtlas platform[9] and additional sources[10]. Neurons classified as \u201cexcitatory\" include glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons, while \u201cinhibitory\u201d neurons are primarily GABAergic. Neurons using serotonin, octopamine, dopamine, or orphan neurons without a known neurotransmitter were categorized as \"other.\" Using this updated neuron classification, we confirmed the presence of the XOR motif in the adult hermaphrodite connectome and extended our previous results by explicitly requiring specific neuron types in the different nodes of the motif."}, {"title": "Identifying XOR Motifs in the C. Elegans Connectome", "content": "Searching for a small subgraph motif, like the XOR motif (a six-node configuration, each node potentially of three types, with eight directed edges), within a larger graph such as the C. Elegans connectome (300 nodes and over 3.700 edges), is facilitated by graph analysis tools such as the NetworkX Python library [11], particularly its directed graph (DiGraph) methods. First, as in our previous work, we identified the \"strict\" XOR motif, defined as six neurons connected exclusively through eight specific edges, without imposing additional constraints on neuron types. Using the isomorphism matching functionality in DiGraph and removing duplicates from symmetric configurations (e.g. interchanging nodes 1\u21943 and 2\u21944 ), we found 722 strict XOR motifs. This count is significantly higher than the 285 motifs reported in our earlier analysis, which used a connectome with only 2.100 edges. Next, we imposed neuron-type constraints on the XOR motif nodes: node 6 as inhibitory, nodes 1\u20134 as excitatory, and no restriction on node 5. To enhance analytical coverage, we also allowed neurons of the \"other\" type to occupy any node. With these restrictions, we identified 134 \"true\" XOR motifs, confirming the significance of this motif under biologically relevant constraints, particularly as it corresponds to a configuration capable of implementing a functional XOR switch."}, {"title": "Virtual XOR Motifs in the Connectome", "content": "The NetworkX matcher.subgraph.isomorphism iterator has proved invaluable for identifying motifs in large graphs, and we have used it extensively in the analysis of other connectomes, as discussed below. However, for a relatively small connectome, such as that of C.Elegans, we also have the possibility of testing \"virtual\" XOR motifs, i.e. motifs involving additional edges between the same nodes. Our main interest is to extend the \"true\" XOR motif with connections providing feedback from the output neuron, to provide a basic plasticity mechanism by reinforcement through this feedback, as we already suggested in our previous note[2] and will discuss below. We used another Digraph procedure, the matcher.subgraph.monomorphism iterator, to find these \"virtual\" motifs."}, {"title": "XOR motif in Drosophila", "content": "The recent publication of the complete connectome of Drosophila[13], has allowed us to extend the analysis of XOR motif abundance to a much more complex organism with very different neurons. We have used the data corresponding to 80 different neuropils available from[14], and have considered cholinergic connections as excitatory and both GABAergic and glutamatergic connections as inhibitory, following [15],[16],[17].\nUsing a parallelized Python script and restricting our search to isomorphisms, we examined the number of \"strictly true\" XOR motifs in the 80 neuropils. The results are presented in Table 1 below for the 30 neuropils with more neurons. It can be observed that the ratio of XOR motifs increases significantly for some of the neuropils, and it is strictly zero in other cases, as also shown in Figure 6.\nIt is interesting that the neuropils in which the ratio of XOR motifs is higher compared to the number of neuronal connections are involved in the processing of sensory input: the AVLP (Anterior Ventrolateral Protocerebrum) L/R neuropils are an integrative centre for sensory and motor information, whereas the LO (Lamina Optic) L/R are involved in the processing of visual information. It is also interesting to note the clear asymmetry between AVLP_R and AVLP_L, while the number of neurons and connections are quite similar."}, {"title": "XOR motifs in mice", "content": "To continue the study of connectomes in other more complex organisms, we used the open data available from the Brain Allen Institute [18] to analyse the V1 visual cortex of mice, which contains a total of around 79 million connections between 230.924 neurons (192.545 excitatory neurons, 38.346 inhibitory neurons), and was used to configure and simulate a network of GLIF (Leak Integrate and Fire) neurons, which was compared with another implemented using a more detailed and realistic biological model of the neurons [19]. The input data is structured as an h5 file, where a subset describing the connectome edges refers to another one assigning all neurons an identification and type, and a third structure describes a total of 111 neuron types, covering the L2/3, L4, L5 and L6 V1 layers. We have transformed this h5 file structure into three .csv files ( v1_edges.csv,v1_nodes.csv,v1_nodes_types . csv ) so we can reuse the previous python scripts with minor modifications. However, unlike the previous case, where we have divided the drosophila connectome into neuropils, there is no obvious segmentation that we could use to explore this quite large connectome, nor an obvious way to parallelize such exploration. Exploring the \u201cfirst\u201d 10 million connections, following the ordering in the original list of edges, including 230.893 neurons, we have found 34.524.437 isomorphic instances of the \"true strict\" XOR motif. This is not only an incomplete but also a biased result, as it is affected by such ordering and the potential connection to a specific substructure, and in fact when using another subset of 10 million of connections randomly selected among the 79 million in the total sample, we have found that the number of \"true strict\" XOR motifs was decreased by almost a factor 5 (7.034.330 isomorphic instances). As processing the full connectome may require several months with our current approach, we have started to explore the layered structure for these sets of \"true strict\" XOR motifs. Neurons' names in this V1 set are assigned according to their excitatory or inhibitory nature (e/i) and their cortex layers (2/3, 4, 5, 6). Tables 2 and 3 show the neuron types for each node (E1/E3, E2/E4, INH and XOR) in the XOR motifs found in the two subsets of 10 million connections."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The analysis of the presence of XOR motifs in very different connectomes, from worms to mice, indicates a potential interest of this explicit configuration involving excitatory and inhibitory neurons, already suggested by previous results[22] considering three and four node motifs in different connectomes[13],[24],[25] and also by the importance of the so-called WTALL (Winner Takes All) circuits [26].\nHowever, the analysis presented here proposes that the XOR motif may provide a common basis for better understanding the importance of the E/I balance for homeostasis, and probably its relevance as a direct feedback signal for learning, implementing a kind of basic loss function.\nAlthough the relevance of computation at the dendritic level is well established [27],[28],[29], these XOR motifs may provide the key to computation at the neuronal circuit level. This may be the case in the mouse primary visual cortex, where a GLIF network based on the same connectome as we studied provides firing rates comparable to those obtained from biologically detailed models using NEST[19]. The integration of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the motif suggests a different approach to solving the XOR problem than other proposals using spiking neurons[30].\nThe possibility that a simple regulatory control can also drive a quite sophisticated task such as learning has yet to be confirmed by understanding how such XOR feedback is reinjected and used to promote plasticity, but it seems computationally feasible based on the well-known results of using random feedback to train computational neural networks [31].\nIf so, we could already have two of the three key components proposed in[32] to provide a connecting framework with the machine learning techniques: architecture, and objective function. For the third one, learning methods, we are already exploring a possible implementation in spiking neural networks through backpropagation in time via axonal delays[33]."}], "parameters": [{"name": "tau_excit", "value": "10 ms: Excitatory neurons membrane time constant."}, {"name": "tau_inhib", "value": "10 ms: Inhibitory neurons membrane time constant."}, {"name": "V_threshold", "value": "-50.0 mV: Firing threshold."}, {"name": "V_rest", "value": "-60 mV: Rest Voltage."}, {"name": "V_reset", "value": "-65 mV: Restart Voltage after firing."}, {"name": "V_min", "value": "-80 mV: Lower limit for membrane voltage (after inhibition)."}, {"name": "V_max", "value": "+30 mV: Upper limit for membrane voltage."}, {"name": "Refractory period", "value": "2 ms."}, {"name": "dv/dt", "value": "(V_rest - v + I_exc - I_inh) / tau: Voltage dynamics (unless refractory)."}, {"name": "dI_exc/dt", "value": "-I_exc / (20 ms): Excitatory current decay."}, {"name": "dI_inh/dt", "value": "-I_inh / (20 ms): Inhibitory current decay."}]}

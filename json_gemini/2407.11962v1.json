In the context of dynamic clothed humans, complex cloth dynamics generate non-rigid motions that are intrinsically distinct from skeletal articulations and critically important for the rendering quality. The conventional approach models non-rigid motions as spatial (3D) deviations in addition to skeletal transformations. However, it is either time-consuming or challenging to achieve optimal quality due to its high learning complexity without a direct supervision. To target this problem, we propose a novel approach of modeling non-rigid motions as radiance residual fields to benefit from more direct color supervision in the rendering and utilize the rigid radiance fields as a prior to reduce the complexity of the learning process. Our approach utilizes a single multiresolution hash encoding (MHE) to concurrently learn the canonical T-pose representation from rigid skeletal motions and the radiance residual field for non-rigid motions. Additionally, to further improve both training efficiency and usability, we extend MoCo-NeRF to support simultaneous training of multiple subjects within a single framework, thanks to our effective design for modeling non-rigid motions. This scalability is achieved through the integration of a global MHE and learnable identity codes in addition to multiple local MHEs. We present extensive results on ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap, clearly demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both single- and multi-subject settings.

NeRF [42] leverages an MLP to learn a static 3D representation of a scene from a dense set of images from diverse viewpoints. For its application in real-life scenarios, prior works have enhanced NeRF in various directions such as improving efficiencies [4,13,19,36,44,54,59,82] or relieving strong reliance on impractical settings like dense input views [5,24,38,70,83]. In addition, there are more branches of work such as large-scale modeling [55, 66, 68, 77, 79], improving rendering quality [2,3], reconstruction quality [46, 69, 81] and more. However, they are restricted to static scenes while the majority of the real-world objects are dynamic.\nRecent works including [11, 12, 35, 47, 48, 53, 67, 76] have broadened the modeling capabilities of NeRF to dynamic scenes with small and simple movements/deformations. However, they often fail in handling more dynamic or complex motions like human body articulations. In contrast, our approach enables learning of human-articulated motions from monocular videos, and performing free-viewpoint rendering of a human performer at any time frame of the videos.\nNeural rendering of humans. Many early-stage prior works for neural human renderings utilize traditional techniques like multi-view stereo [16,60,61,75] or to build sophisticated systems for capturing human motions [8, 10, 40, 65]. However, constructing a dense set of training views and building those capturing systems are expensive, making them unsuitable for real-life situations. [1,6,57,58] address 3D human reconstruction by utilizing ground truth human scans, relieving the aforementioned requirements. [9, 20, 45] further improves it by enabling human reconstruction from 2D image collections. In recent days, there have been many works learning an implicit human representation for novel pose synthesis [22,23, 25, 27, 34, 50, 56, 64, 71, 87-89] or for a novel-view synthesis [27, 28, 31, 37, 51, 52, 64, 73, 74, 78, 85, 86]. There also have been several generalizable works [41, 43,62] for a novel human subject with pre-training on multi-view dataset and a few-shot fine-tuning. [7,80] focus on improving rendering efficiency to achieve real-time free-view rendering of dynamic humans. Furthermore, [14, 26, 28, 49] adopt explicit hash encoding [44] in order to boost the training efficiency for human representation modeling. In contrast to our problem setup, most of those works require multi-view videos or do not model the non-rigid motions.\nMonocular photo-realistic human rendering. HumanNeRF [73] presents a state-of-the-art performance by optimizing motion fields and canonical T-pose representation of a human performer. However, its implicit modeling of pose-dependent non-rigid motions requires tens of hours to converge. Instant-NVR [14] achieves efficient training with part-based representation and 2D motion parameterization for learning non-rigid motions as 3D offsets.

We introduce our novel radiance compositional NeRF approach based on different motion types: rigid and non-rigid motions, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The composition of canonical radiance and the per-sample pose-dependent radiance residuals (Sec. 3.2) facilitates photo-realistic quality of rendering with fine-grained modeling of non-rigid motions, rather than leveraging the conventional spatial 3D offset learning approach. We further improve the quality of non-rigid radiance residuals by introducing a pose-embedded implicit features (Sec. 3.2) that is jointly optimized with the non-rigid radiance branch. In Sec. 3.3, thanks to our effective design of non-rigid motion modeling, it enables MoCo-NeRF to be flexibly extended for unified training of multiple subjects with a high efficiency."}, {"title": "3.1 Preliminary: Skeletal Transformations", "content": "The skeletal motion learns an inverse formulation of the linear blend skinning [32], which transforms canonical points to different body poses by skinning weights.

The rigid branch of MoCo-NeRF is specifically designed to learn the canonical T-pose representation of the target subject using only rigid body movements. Our approach is different from but simpler than the prevalent spatial offset learning approach, which incorporates complex modeling of non-rigid motions as $\\Delta x_c$. Our rigid branch instead directly predicts the color and density of the canonical point $x_c$ transformed by inverse linear blend skinning (Sec. 3.1), as depicted in Fig. 2. First, we query multiresolution volumetric features $f_{x_c}$ of the canonical point $x_c$ from the MHE $\u03a8_{hash}$ as follows:\n\n$f_{x_c} = \u03a8_{hash}(x_c)$.\n\nThen, we slice the first half (H dimensions) of $f_{x_c}$ at each level of resolution to compute $f_{x_c}^{H}$ and predicts the radiance c and density \u03c3 of the rigid canonical point $x_c$ with an MLP decoder $M_{rigid}$ as follows:\n\n$c, \u03c3 = M_{rigid}(f_{x_c}^H)$.\n\nNon-rigid neural branch for learning radiance residual field. While the canonical representation does not explicitly model pose-dependent non-rigid motions, it still captures an average of such motions (mean motions) after training. However, the mean motions cannot effectively reflect the complex and realistic non-rigid motions under different body poses. It is only capable of rendering identical deformations across different poses, as can be observed in Fig. 1. To address this effectively, the non-rigid branch of MoCo-NeRF is designed to concurrently optimize for a radiance residual field. This models the appearance discrepancies between the renderings of the rigid branch and the ground-truth colors, typically caused by the complex non-rigid motions or deformations. We additionally condition the radiance residual predictions with the canonical radiance representation of the rigid branch as prior information.

Each monocular video exhibits distinct non-rigid motions, thereby requiring individualized modeling. However, it is impossible for the traditional spatial offset learning approach [73] that typically requires a heavy module for photo-realistic quality. In contrast, our radiance compositional approach can achieve it by employing a separate, lightweight MHE for each subject, referred to as local MHE.\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose three architectural modifications as illustrated in Fig. 4. To benefit from unified training of multiple subjects, we introduce a coarse global MHE $\u03a8_{hash}^G$ shared across all subjects to learn subject-generic representations (e.g., body shapes). We also ensure learning of subject-specific details with $N_s$ local MHES $\\{\u03a8_{hash}^i\\}_{i=1}^{N_s}$, where $N_s$ is the number of subjects.

Pixel-wise metrics (PSNR) are less sensitive to these details, but better reflected by perceptual metric LPIPS* as shown in Fig. A. Nevertheless, Tab. 1 in the paper shows our significant improvements in LPIPS*and SSIM. Fig. 5 in the paper and Fig. A show GauHuman lacks detailed cloth wrinkles for most of subjects, even with longer training.

Despite HumanNeRF's comparable quality, its training efficiency is much worse than our proposed MoCo-NeRF as discussed in the main paper.

As mentioned in the main paper, we com- pare against these models targeting different task since there is no prior work learning distinct representations for multiple subjects from monocular videos.

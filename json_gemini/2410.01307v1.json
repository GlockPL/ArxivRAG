The Indian Premier League (IPL), epitomizing Twenty20 cricket, showcases talent in a format that lasts just a few hours as opposed to the longer forms of the game. Renowned for its fusion of technology and fan engagement, the IPL stands as the world's most popular cricket league. This study concentrates on Dream11, India's leading fantasy cricket league for IPL, where participants craft virtual teams based on real player performances to compete internationally.\nBuilding a winning fantasy team requires navigating various complex factors including player form and match conditions. Traditionally, this has been approached through operations research and machine learning. This research introduces the FanCric framework, an advanced multi-agent system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and a robust orchestration framework to enhance fantasy team selection in cricket. FanCric employs both structured and unstructured data to surpass traditional methods by incorporating sophisticated AI technologies.\nThe analysis involved scrutinizing approximately 12.7 million unique entries from a Dream11 contest, evaluating FanCric's efficacy against the collective wisdom of crowds and a simpler Prompt Engineering approach. Ablation studies further assessed the impact of generating varying numbers of teams. The exploratory findings are promising, indicating that further investigation into FanCric's capabilities is warranted to fully realize its potential in enhancing strategic decision-making using LLM's in fantasy sports and business in general.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Cricket, the world's second most-followed sport, captivates billions of fans with its complex strategies and rich history [1]. The Indian Premier League (IPL), as the"}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": "The field of sports analytics has seen significant evolution over the past decade, with artificial intelligence and machine learning models fast transforming the domain [17]. In cricket, the application of AI, in particular machine learning has facilitated detailed performance analysis and predictive modeling, enhancing decision-making processes in the sport [1]. These advancements and the popularity of the sport have contributed to the rising popularity of Fantasy 11 contests, particularly in leagues built around the Indian Premier League, where fans actively engage in creating and managing their own teams based on real-time data and player performance, with Dream 11 being the most popular platform [2].\nRecent studies have focused on various statistical, AI, and optimization techniques to prepare optimal Fantasy 11 teams. For example, a study implemented a team recommendation system using machine learning and skill-based ranking of players, considering multiple factors such as batting, bowling, fielding skills, pitch type, and weather conditions [3]. Optimization techniques such as integer programming have also been applied to maximize the overall performance of Fantasy 11 teams, ensuring a balanced mix of players [4,5]. Furthermore, traditional methods like the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) have been employed to evaluate and select the best players based on multiple performance criteria [6]. Notably, a recent study compared different team selection methods using the fantasy league scoring system, highlighting the effectiveness of machine learning and optimization techniques in achieving higher fantasy scores [7].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications including strategic tasks and as autonomous agents [9]. These models are increasingly used for complex decision-making processes, leveraging their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data. For instance, LLMs have been employed extensively in board games and video games, demonstrating their strategic and local reasoning capabilities [8]. Studies such as those on k-level reasoning and LLM as a mastermind have explored the application of LLMs in these domains, showcasing their potential to enhance strategic gameplay and decision-making [18, 19]. Prompt engineering is the preferred approach for getting desired results in most applications [20].\nMulti-agent systems have off-late shown to improve performance by distributing tasks among multiple agents, each specialized in a particular area [10, 21]. This approach has been effectively applied across various domains such as simulating games [11], software development [12], and financial trading [22]. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components, multi-agent systems can optimize processes, enhance efficiency, and achieve better outcomes. These systems leverage collaboration and communication among agents to adapt dynamically to changing environments, making them highly suitable for applications that require complex decision-making, strategic thinking, and planning [23].\nThe use of LLMs in sports analytics is expanding, with applications in predicting events in various field sports such as football and the NFL. Studies have shown that LLMs can effectively forecast match outcomes and player performance, enhancing the"}, {"title": "3 FanCric Architecture", "content": "FanCric architecture leverages an open-source multi-agentic framework LangGraph [13] for its implementation. LangGraph, developed on the LangChain[14] platform, is designed for constructing stateful multi-agent applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It facilitates the creation of complex agent workflows such as cyclic graph structures, enhancing flow and state management. This framework supports the definition of workflows, flow control, and scalability, making it particularly suited for the FanCric framework, where managing multiple agents and complex decision-making is crucial for optimizing fantasy cricket team selections. Building on this, the construction of a Fantasy 11 cricket team involves a complex decision-making process that must account for various factors to ensure optimal team performance. This includes a deep analysis of player statistics, current form, historical performances, and contextual factors such as match venue, opponent strength, and prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, strategic considerations such as player roles, strengths & weaknesses, team composition, and potential point-scoring opportunities must be meticulously evaluated\nThe FanCric framework is designed to streamline the process of building Fantasy 11 cricket teams through a coordinated effort of specialized LLM agents, each contributing to different stages of the team selection process. This multi-agent approach is known to enhance the efficiency of the tasks like team assembly in our current study but also ensures that each decision is informed by deep, contextual insights gathered and processed through sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) interactions."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we embark on a systematic exploration of the FanCric framework through a series of experiments designed to assess its effectiveness and efficiency in constructing Fantasy 11 cricket teams. Our experiments are tailored to evaluate the performance of FanCric against traditional prompting LLM approaches as well as comparing results with the entries from the participants of a fantasy 11 event on Dream11 for a randomly identified IPL game. The different metrics and experimental settings, help us to compare the approaches and also help us to understand the effects of various components in our framework. This experiment also helps in evaluating the FanCric architecture and its predictive and optimization capabilities in real-world settings."}, {"title": "4.1 Research Questions", "content": "The main research intent of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the FanCric framework in assembling winning Fantasy 11 cricket teams. Our experiments are structured around the following key research questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: How does FanCric's performance compare to teams generated by an LLM, purely using a prompt engineering approach [19]?\n\u2022 RQ2: How does the performance of FanCric's proposed teams measure up against the 'Wisdom of Crowds' team, defined as the mean or median score of all teams participating in a fantasy contest [15, 16]?\n\u2022 RQ3: How effectively do the individual agents within the FanCric framework contribute to the generation of relevant and actionable information for fantasy cricket team selection?\nRQ4: Through ablation studies, explore the effect of varying the number of generated teams on the performance of the proposed teams, evaluating if the number of teams generated impacts the performance.\nGiven the nascent state of applying multi-agent systems to fantasy cricket team selection and in general, this study adopts an exploratory approach focused on broad research questions rather than specific hypotheses. This method allows for an open exploration of how various factors influence team performance in Dream 11 fantasy leagues, setting the stage for more targeted hypotheses in future studies."}, {"title": "4.2 Experimental Setup", "content": "Our detailed experimental analysis was centered on a specific randomly chosen match from the 2023 IPL season, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) vs Mumbai Indians (MI), played on May 16th as the 63rd of 72 games in the season at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket stadium in Lucknow. The dataset for comparison of how the team faired comprised of Dream 11 fantasy team selections from over 13.8 million entries, parsed from 14 different PDF files (each having a million entries spread"}, {"title": "4.3 Results", "content": "In this section, we address the research questions outlined earlier by comparing performances from the Wisdom of Crowds, the prompt engineering approach, and the FanCric approach. Specifically, we evaluate the team selection performance of the prompt engineering and FanCric approaches and compare them to the team chosen by the Wisdom of Crowds. For consistency in our comparisons of the prompt engineering and FanCric approaches, we standardize the evaluations by generating 10 teams for each method. The value of 10 was chosen as it corresponding to the median number of entries allowed on the Dream 11 platform for varying sizes of contests. This approach thus ensures a focused analysis of how each method performs under similar conditions. A more nuanced evaluation is included in the ablation studies section.\nIn the examination of the Wisdom of Crowds, applied to choosing Fantasy 11 cricket teams, our data scraping efforts initially collected 13.8 million team entries. Post the removal of duplicates, we were left with 12.7 million unique teams, offering insight into the popular choices and strategies prevalent among participants. Suryakumar Yadav from Mumbai Indians was the most favored captain with over 3.28 million picks."}, {"title": "4.4 Ablation Studies", "content": "The ablation study conducted examined the effect of varying the number of fantasy cricket teams (n) generated on the performance in Dream11 contests, where n was chosen as 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20. This selection range is reflective of Dream11's contest rules, where the number of permissible team entries are limited to a maximum of 20 for larger contests and varies between 1 and 20 for smaller ones. The results which include the average points scored by the teams, percentile rank averages, hit rate in selecting captains or vice-captains and players from the Dream Team, the win percentage indicating teams that ranked within the top 66.7 percentile and the top ranked team in the set are presented. The outcomes from a prompt engineering approach are included in brackets as a benchmark for comparison.\nIn the analysis, it is observed that the FanCric approach generally yielded higher average points compared to the prompt engineering approach, except when only one team was generated. This indicates the inherent unpredictability's in cricket and fantasy team selection - the advanced analytics employed by FanCric begin to show it's effectiveness only as the number of generated teams increases. This trend is evident from the higher average points and percentile ranks recorded for larger sets of generated teams. Although the prompt engineering approach selected Dream Team players on an average more, however this also indicates that the FanCric approach led to player selections that scored higher overall, suggesting a more effective selection of players.\nThe win rates between the two approaches were comparable, but notably improved in the FanCric model as the number of teams increased. A standout result in the study was a FanCric team achieving a 99.93 percentile rank with a total score of 722 when 20 teams were generated, underscoring the potential of a multi-agentic approach to enhance outcome predictions as more options are generated. The FanCric approach consistently outperformed the average (501.5) and median scores (512) of the Wisdom of Crowds, except in the n=5 case. This enhanced performance in team selection by"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The analysis of the FanCric framework provided evidence regarding its efficiency in assembling fantasy cricket teams, evaluated against established benchmark of the wisdom of crowds [15.16]. For RQ1, FanCric outperformed the standard LLM (ChatGPT) prompt engineering approach in most studies, particularly as the number of generated teams increased. This suggests that the multi-agentic, nuanced approach of FanCric is superior for complex decision-making tasks such as fantasy cricket team selection, where variability and unpredictability are driven by identifiable factors. However, the performance benchmarks could be further improved with further fine tuning the FanCric approach to improve its performance. In addressing RQ2, our findings showed that FanCric's teams consistently exceeded the performance metrics established by the Wisdom of Crowds, indicating its capability to leverage and synthesize data effectively and indicating a potential application in fantasy cricket leagues.\nRegarding RQ3, the cohesive operation of individual agents within the FanCric framework, the Researcher, Career Profiler, Form Assessor, Strategizer and Selector proved crucial. As we saw in the qualitative assessment each agent contributed uniquely to refining the selection process, emphasizing the value of integrating diverse analytical and qualitative perspectives in sports analytics. It also indicates the value of human like deliberations possible between LLM's with multi-agentic frameworks for decision making.\nOur ablation studies for investigating RQ4, highlighted that increasing the number of teams generated directly correlates with no discernible decrease in performance however can improve chances of winning. This relationship suggests that higher quantities of generated teams enable a broader exploration of potential team configurations, which"}, {"title": "6 Conclusions and Further Research", "content": "This exploratory study with the FanCric framework has shown promising results in the context of fantasy cricket team selection. While FanCric has demonstrated potential advantages over traditional methods and the Wisdom of Crowds approach, the findings which are based on retrospective analysis necessitate further empirical studies to more robustly confirm its superiority for live games in real-life settings. The current study highlights FanCric's initial efficacy, but additional simulation studies are crucial to establish its effectiveness conclusively.\nFuture research should focus on refining the FanCric architecture, incorporating advanced AI/ML algorithms and operations research techniques into the framework that could enhance decision-making processes further. This might involve adapting the system to integrate other insights like social media opinions, expert opinions etc. which could more dynamically adjust team selections based on pertinent game insights. Moreover, expanding the scope of ablation studies are needed to identify which components of the LLM or specific configurations yield the best results and also understand how varying these to use different LLM's or newer models with improved reasoning capabilities change outcomes. This framework could also be useful to adopt for other sports as well.\nFurther exploration of the multi-agentic approach as adopted in this study not only promises significant improvements in strategic decision-making within sports analytics but also holds the potential to revolutionize broader applications such as stock portfolio management, marketing strategy optimization, and resource allocation across various business contexts. As highlighted by a recent McKinsey study, integration of agent-based systems in generative AI could fundamentally transform business approaches and decision-making processes [35]. This adaptation could lead to more dynamic and responsive strategies across industries, effectively leveraging advanced Al capabilities to address complex and varied challenges."}]}

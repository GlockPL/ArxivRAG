Its structure resembles that of a recurrent neural network, and it utilizes activation functions such as sigmoid or tanh for reasoning. Compared to neural networks, FCM exhibits excellent interpretability [1,2]. Due to the tangible meaning of its nodes and the absence of hidden layers, FCM emulates the cognitive processing of the human brain. Over the past 40 years, FCM have been successfully applied in various domains [3]. The FCM model can be defined as follow:\nDefinition 1. Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is defined as a 4-tuple M = {C,W, A, f} where C denotes the collection of all map neurons, $W : (C_i, C_j) \\rightarrow w_{ij}$ defines the causal weight matrix W, A: $C \\rightarrow A^{(t)}$ represents the function that determines the activation level of each neuron $C_i$ at a specific discrete time step t(where t = 1,2,\u2026\u2026 ,T) and f(\u00b7) is the activation function.\nEq. (1) illustrates the interaction of above elements, demonstrating how the vector $A^{(t)} = [A_1^{(t)}, A_2^{(t)}, ..., A_M^{(t)}]^T$ is iteratively calculated from the initial state vector $A^{(0)} = [A_1^{(0)}, A_2^{(0)}, ..., A_M^{(0)}]^T$.\n\n$A^{(t+1)} = f (WA^{(t)})$ (1)\n\nEq. (1) serves as the general updating rule, as it employs the current neuron activation value $A_i^{(t)}$ to determine the subsequent state $A_i^{(t+1)}$. However, in certain applications, this recursive feature is prohibited, as it implicitly includes self-reinforcing causal links, and there are situations where a variable should not be influenced by its own state, in such cases, $W_{ii}$ = 0.\nThe elements of the weight matrix are typically constrained within the range of [-1,1], while the activation values of nodes, denoted as A, are usually set within the intervals [0, 1] or [-1,1]. In discrete activation states, the activation functions commonly employed is binary function or trivalent function; whereas in continuous activation states, sigmoid function (Eq.2) or hyperbolic tangent (Eq.3) function is typically used. When the activation function is a sigmoid function, the range of node activations is [0, 1]; conversely, when the activation function is a tanh function, the range of node activations is [-1,1].\n\n$S(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ (2)\n\n$tanh(x) = \\frac{e^{\\lambda x} \u2013 e^{-x}}{e^{\\lambda x} + e^{-x}}$ (3)\n\nIn Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), the parameter $\\lambda$ is used to control the slope of the activation function, taking a value greater than 0, and its magnitude is closely related to the convergence behavior of the FCM.\nNumerous scholars have proposed several extensions to enhance the uncertainty representa- tion and dynamic reasoning capabilities of FCMs. Among them, Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Map (FGGCM) is an extension of FCMs in terms of uncertainty representation. FGGCM builds upon fuzzy grey cognitive maps (FGCM) and incorporates the concept of general grey numbers (GGN) from grey system theory. By employing the kernel and the degree of greyness of GGN for iterative reasoning, FGGCM acquires the ability to simultaneously handle multiple interval data (represented using GGN).\nThe convergence of FCMs holds significant guidance for various aspects such as large-scale system simulation, learning algorithm, and pattern recognition. Unclear convergence can pose significant challenges to the design of FCMs, in such cases, designed FCMs may converge to undesired states or chaotic states, rendering them ineffective. Thus, the convergence of FCMs has gradually attracted the attention of many scholars. As the iterative reasoning of FCMs"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "According to the literature available to the author, the study of the convergence properties of FCMs originated with B. Kosko, who introduced the FCM model. Specifically, Kosko de- vised an analytical technique that utilized Liapounov functions to achieve stable outcomes for Feedback Standard Additive Models (SAM), which share numerous similarities with FCMs. However, Kosko concluded that these robust mathematical conditions and theorems are not readily applicable to FCMs due to the extensive network of feedback connections inherent in FCM-based architectures.\nSubsequently, Athanasios K. Tsadiras's team analyzed the dynamic behavior of certainty neuron FCMS (CNFCMs). They were the first to describe in the literature the three convergence scenarios of FCMs and identified how two parameters influence the system's dynamic behavior, transitioning it from a fixed point to a limit cycle [9]. Additionally, Taber et al. demonstrated that with small data, the construction of the weight matrix is more likely to lead to FCMS exhibiting a limit cycle state [10,11].\nBy 2009, Boutalis et al. utilized the Banach fixed point theorem to analyze the sufficient conditions for FCMs with sigmoid activation functions to converge to a unique fixed point, as well as the conditions for the existence of fixed points that may not be unique [6]. Subsequently, based on the convergence properties of FCMs, Boutalis' team proposed the fuzzy cognitive network (FCN) model and applied it to various domains such as indirect adaptive inverse control of power plants, DC motor control, motor damage and diagnosis, time series prediction, and fault detection of induction generators [12-16].\nIn 2014, N\u00e1poles et al. found that the number of sigmoidal FCM's fixed point is dependent on the magnitude of $\\lambda$. When $\\lambda$ is tiny and positive, the system yields a solitary solution, signifying a fixed point of stability in the sigmoid FCM. With $\\lambda$ substantially positive, the system may present multiple solutions, some being stable fixed points. These findings are especially pertinent in control systems, where steady outputs are regardless of initial conditions, such as in system identification and control strategy development [17].

This is achieved by leveraging the broader range of uncertainty processing capabilities inherent in Grey System Theory, which were not fully utilized by FGCM. FGGCM adopts the general grey number (GGN) as its fundamental building block, as opposed to the interval grey number (IGN) used in FGCM.\n3.1 The General Grey Number\nThe GGN is an amalgamation of IGN, defined as $g^{\\neq} \\in \\cup_{i=1}^n[a_i, \\bar{a}_i]$. For instance, [0, 1.2]U[1.5, 2] U [3, 5] U6 constitutes a GGN, while [0, 1] not only serves as an IGN but also represents a special case of a GGN. The mathematical operations between GGNs and IGNs is different. IGNs utilize their upper and lower bounds for mathematical operations [41], whereas GGNs rely on their kernel and greyness. Both GGNs and IGNs possess a kernel that signifies the most probable crisp value within the grey number's range. The kernel of an IGN can be computed as the expectation of the crisp value, while the kernel of a GGN is determined using Eqs. (8) and (9) [42].\n\n$\\hat{g} = \\frac{1}{n} (\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{a}_i)$. (8)\n\n$\\hat{g} = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \\hat{a}_i$. (9)\n\nIn Eqs. (8) and (9), $\\hat{a}_i$ represents the kernel of the interval $[a_i, \\bar{a}_i]$. It is calculated as the expectation of the crisp value. When the distribution of the GGN is unknown, Eq. (8) can be employed to calculate the kernel of the GGN. Conversely, if the distribution of a GGN is known, and the probability that $g^{\\neq}$ falls within the interval $[a_i, \\bar{a}_i]$ is $p_i$ for i = 1,2,\u2026, n, with $\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$ and $p_i > 0$ for i = 1,2,\u2026, n, then Eq. (9) can be used to compute the kernel of the GGN.\nGiven the domain $\\Omega$ and the measure $\\mu(\u00b7)$, the greyness degree of a GGN $g^{\\neq}$ is determined by the following expression:\n\n$g^{\\circ}(g^{\\neq}) = \\frac{1}{|\\Omega|} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{a}_i \\mu(a_i)/ \\mu(\\Omega)$. (10)\n\nThis greyness value quantifies the degree of uncertainty associated with the GGN $g^{\\neq}$. For convergence, the greyness degree will be called greyness in the following text.\nThe representation of a GGN using its kernel and greyness is given by the simplified form $\\hat{g}_{g^{\\circ}}$, where $\\hat{g}$ represents the kernel and $g^{\\circ}$ signifies the greyness. A GGN is also can be represent as $g^{\\neq} = \\hat{g}_{g^{\\circ}}$ or $\\otimes g = \\hat{g}_{g^{\\circ}}$, while a IGN is often represent as $g = [\\underline{g},\\bar{g}]$ The operating rules for GGNs are as follows:"}, {"title": "3.2 The Activation Functions of FGGCM", "content": "The FGGCM adopts the GGN as its fundamental element, replacing the IGN used in the original FGCM. This substitution extends the FGGCM's ability to model uncertainty, as GGNs are capable of representing a broader range of uncertainty than IGNs. The sigmoid and tanh activation functions, which have been validated in [43], are employed in the FGGCM, as shown in Eqs. (11) and (14).\nThe sigmoid function, as referenced in [43], is defined as follows:\n\n$S(g^{\\pm}) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\lambda g^{\\neq}}}$ (11)\n\nS($g^{\\pm}$) is a new GGN, the kernel is\n\n$\\hat{S}(g) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\lambda \\hat{g}}}$, (12)\n\nthe greyness is\n\n$S^{\\circ}(g) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\lambda \\hat{g}g^{\\circ}}}$. (13)\n\nThe hyperbolic tangent function in the context of GGNs is defined as:\n\n$tanh(g^{\\pm}) = \\frac{e^{\\lambda g^{\\pm}} - e^{-\\lambda g^{\\neq}}}{e^{\\lambda g^{\\pm}} + e^{-\\lambda g^{\\neq}}}$ (14)\n\nThe kernel is\n\n$tanh(\\hat{g}) = \\frac{e^{\\lambda \\hat{g}} - e^{-\\lambda \\hat{g}}}{e^{\\lambda \\hat{g}} + e^{-\\lambda \\hat{g}}}$, (15)\n\nthe greyness is\n\n$(tanh(g^{\\pm}))^{\\circ} = g^{\\circ}$ (16)\n\nLike Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), in Eq. (11) to Eq. (14), the $\\lambda$ is a positive parameter to set the steepness of the curve or surface. Using these two activation functions, FGGCM can carry out reasoning within the range of node values between [0, 1] or [-1,1]."}, {"title": "4 The Completeness of Related Spaces", "content": "This paper employs the Banach fixed point theorem to deduce the convergence conditions of FGGCM.\nLemma 1.

This section will separately illustrate the sufficient conditions for FGGCM to converge to fixed points when the activation function is either the tanh or sigmoid function.\n5.1 The Convergence of tanh FGGCM\nFirst, present a lemma to illustrate a property of the tanh function.\nLemma 3.

This contribution is significant as it provides a critical understanding of the convergence behavior in FGGCM, which is essential for the analysis and application of these models in various domains.\nUtilizing Web Experience FGGCM's weight (54) and an input vector (55), the variation of the greyness over the iterations can be observed, as illustrated in Fig. 15.\nIt can be found that when $\\lambda$ = 0.5 and 1, the greyness of FGGCM converges. However, when $\\lambda$ = 2 or 4, the greyness of FGGCM does not converge but oscillates periodically with the oscillation of the kernels.\nBy employing the Civil FGGCM's weight (58) and an input vector (59), the progression of the greyness as it changes with the number of iterations can be determined.

Finally, this paper will use Theorems 7, 8 and 9 to analyze the greyness convergence of various FGGCMs.\n8.2.1 The Context of Sigmoid\nFig. 15 and 16 respectively show the changes in greyness for the Web Experience FGGCM with a sigmoid activation function and the Civil FGGCM with a tanh activation function.\nUpon examining Fig. 15, it is noticed that when the value of $\\lambda$ is 0.5 and 1, the greyness of FGGCM shows a trend of convergence. This indicates that under these specific parameter settings, the greyness of the model stably tends towards a fixed value. However, when the value of $\\lambda$ increases to 2 or 4, a significant change occurs. In this case, the kernel of FGGCM no longer exhibits convergence but instead enters a state of periodic oscillation, which causes that the greyness of FGGCM is not stably tending towards a fixed point, but rather periodically varying within a certain range as the kernel oscillates.\nThe convergence of the greyness for the web engineering FGGCM can be judged according to Eq. (39) in Theorem 9. Let"}, {"title": "9 Conclusions", "content": "This paper mainly studies the convergence conditions of Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Maps (FGGCM).

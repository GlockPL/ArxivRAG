Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a \"hypernetwork\" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

Some examples include imaging, genomics, and electronic health records (EHRs). These diverse data types are highly interrelated and essential for informed clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Traditional CDS systems, however, often fall short when integrating and interpreting voluminous and multifaceted information across different clinical data modalities. Consequently, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient methods that effectively leverage this data diversity and uncover deeper insights into disease mechanisms and patient care.\nAn area largely affected by disease heterogeneity is the study of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects millions of people around the world [35]. PD is characterized by a wide range of motor (e.g., bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity) and non-motor (e.g., cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, depression) symptoms that vary dramatically across patients in their onset, severity, and progression [13]. The Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) [12] is a gold-standard clinical assessment for quantifying the heterogeneity of PD symptoms and progression. Conventionally, movement disorder specialists subtype PD into motor phenotypes such as postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) and tremor-dominant (TD) through extensive physical examinations and ratings using MDS-UPDRS. However, the assessments rely on subjective observations, which leads to inter-rater variability between clinicians. This challenge underscores the complexity and variability within the disease and the need for heterogeneous modalities and objective, quantitative biomarkers [36,28].\nIn response to the above challenges, computational methods for classifying PD symptoms have gradually shifted towards more sophisticated models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [40] that learn connections in structured data represented as graphs. These studies, however, often focus on single modalities (e.g., structural or functional neuroimaging) [45,29,16] where each brain region is a node in the graph. Some other works represent whole patient clinical data in a population graph where each patient is a node with features, and a semantic relationship like demographic similarity defines the edges between any two patients; however, they typically use homogeneous graphs (i.e., one node type), which only allow pairwise relationships between patients. Additionally, these works often use naive fusion methods such as clustering [3] for combining graph-based relationships and features from different data modalities, which makes it difficult to derive clinically meaningful interpretations that impact their study objective.\nLastly, multimodal non-imaging and imaging studies predicting motor symptoms in PD [19,2] rely on Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with the dopamine transporter-binding ligands (DaTSCAN) imaging or Position Emission Tomography [30], which is harder to acquire than resting-state fMRI (our imaging modality) and cannot capture functional abnormalities.\nTo better derive clinically meaningful interpretations, this work creates a population graph in a heterogeneous hypergraph structure using imaging and non-imaging patient data to predict motor symptom progression in PD. Hyper-graphs [6] capture patient-to-patient pairwise and patient-to-group higher-order relationships through hyperedges based on a single similarity. However, these structures fail to capture relationships between patients based on different similar-"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Problem Definition Given a multi-modal medical dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{M, B, Y\\}$, where $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F_{img}}$ is 2D or 3D medical imaging data, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F_{non-img}}$ is non-imaging tabular medical data consisting of categorical and numerical features (demographics, cognitive variables, behavioral variables, non-motor progression, and biospecimen), $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\\}$ is a set of ground-truth motor symptom severity measures, where $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for regression tasks or $y_i \\in \\{1,..., c\\}$ for classification tasks with c discrete severity classes. Here, $N$ represents the number of patients, $F_{img}$ is the dimensionality of imaging features, and $F_{non-img}$ is the dimensionality of non-imaging features. Our objective is to predict the motor symptom severity $y_i$ for patient $i$ given their multi-modal medical data, i.e., medical image $m_i \\in M$ and non-image data $b_i \\in B$.\nHypergraph: A hypergraph is an extended graph $\\mathcal{H} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{W})$, where $\\mathcal{V} = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_N\\}$ is a set of vertices (e.g., patients), $\\mathcal{E}$ is the set of hyperedges (e.g., similarities between patients), and $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{E}| \\times |\\mathcal{E}|}$ is a positive, diagonal hyperedge weight matrix, approximately equal to the identity matrix $I$. Each hyperedge $e \\in \\mathcal{E}$ can connect multiple vertices simultaneously, allowing hypergraphs to model complex high-order relations beyond pairwise interactions. The relationship between vertices and hyperedges is represented by an incidence matrix $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}| \\times |\\mathcal{E}|}$, where each non-zero entry $h(v, e)$ denotes $v \\in e$. Additionally, each hypergraph contains a set of vertex features $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}| \\times d}$, where $x_i$ denotes a vector of three-dimensional features $d$ for the vertex $i$.\nHeterogeneous Hypergraph: A heterogeneous hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}_H = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E}, \\mathcal{T}_v, \\mathcal{T}_e, W)$ extends the concept of hypergraphs by incorporating multiple types of vertices $\\mathcal{T}_u$ and hyperedges $\\mathcal{T}_e$.

We pre-define five hyperedge types $\\mathcal{T}_e$ using medical domain knowledge: demographic, cognitive, behavioral, non-motor progression, and biospecimen. For each vertex's non-imaging feature vector $b_i$, we calculate cosine pairwise similarities between patients and group the similarity matrices into clusters via K-means [1]. Each cluster forms a hyperedge where hyperedges belong to the same similarity type. Hyperedges are concatenated to form a final graph $\\mathcal{H}_H$.

We implement a custom feature-based attention message passing to enhance the model's ability to capture complex feature interactions. For each vertex $v$, we compute attention coefficients $a_{v,e}$ for its incident hyperedges $e \\in \\mathcal{E}(v)$:\n$a_{v,e} = softmax_{e \\in \\mathcal{E}(v)} (LeakyReLU(a^{\\top} [Px_v || Px_e]))$ (2)\nwhere a is a learnable attention vector, $x_v$ is the feature vector of vertex $v$, and $x_e$ is the mean feature vector of vertices in hyperedge $e$.

PPMI inclusion criteria were: Healthy Control (HC) or PD participant, baseline visit, OFF medication, resting-state and 3D T1-weighted MRI brain imaging volumes present, biospecimen data available, and \u226550% of non-imaging clinical records present.\nIn total, we obtained 2,313 brain imaging scans to extract imaging features. We selected 28 non-imaging clinical features (informed by a thorough systematic review [19,3,26] See Supplementary Materials for additional information.\nData Processing: For missing non-imaging clinical features, we applied Multiple Imputation with Chained Equation (MICE) [4] for missing non-imaging data, and performed z-score normalization. Due to severe class imbalances for the severely impaired cohort, we binarized gait impairment scores to Mild (0, n=156) and Moderate (1-2, n=186). PIGD scores were calculated from MDS-UPDRS Parts II and III. We pre-processed MRI images using fMRIPrep and an AAL atlas parcellation [39] using nilearn [8,1], resulting in 116 \u00d7 116 functional connectivity (FC) matrices where each entry in row i and column j in the matrix is the Pearson correlation between the average rs-fMRI signal measured in a brain region of interest (ROI) i and ROI j. We z-score normalized the FC matrices and took the flattened upper right triangles as the imaging feature vectors.\nSetup: Our model achieves its best performance with a 2-layer HypergraphConv (provided by PyTorch Geometric [10]), a hidden channel dimension of 64, ReLU activation function, dropout rate of 0.2, and 4 multi-attention heads.

The edge widths here are the attention weights between networks. Overall, we observe several interactions within CN, particularly Crus I, which is significantly associated with overt motor and sensorimotor movement and planning [15,24]. We also see connections between the precentral gyrus (frontal lobe) and the postcentral gyrus (parietal lobe), which play an important role in voluntary movement and are associated with postural deformities and gait freezing [38]. Lesser but significant connections also exist within the cerebellar regions of the CN located in the basal ganglia (e.g. Putamen and Caudate), which are known to have dysfunction in PD due to striatal dopamine deficiency [44,43].\nFig. 3 shows brain functional network activity patterns in patients profiled with a PD-PIGD subtype. It shows a predominant activation of motor-related regions within the SMN (particularly in the Supplementary Motor Area, Primary Motor Cortex, and Basal Ganglia regions), which reflects substantial changes in motor-related activity (herein interpreted as a decrease compared to the non-PID-PIGD case). This aligns with previous findings where these changes may be understood as a result of decreased striatal activations following dopaminergic denervation"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "We propose GAMMA-PD, a hypernetwork fusion framework for multi-modal imaging and non-imaging analysis of motor impairment subtyping in Parkinson's Disease. Rigorous evaluations on several PD medical datasets showed the advantage of our method in assessing gait impairment severity in PD and postural instability subtype differences. We also constructed clinically meaningful interpretations to contextualize which features mostly strongly contributed to model predictions and predicted output correlates to brain functional networks. Future works include expanding our dataset sources, extending our analysis to a longitudinal study to capture symptom progression, investigating additional baselines and network learning mechanisms, and further validating clinical interpretations and ethical implications."}]}

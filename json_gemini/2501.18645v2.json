{"title": "Layered Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comprehensive Approach to Explainable Large Language Models", "authors": ["Manish Sanwal"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (COT) prompting to provide step-by-step rationales, improving performance on complex tasks. Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models have achieved remarkable success across domains such as question answering, machine translation, and code generation, with widely known architectures like GPT, T5 [1, 2]. A central innovation in recent years is chain-of-thought prompting, wherein an LLM produces a series of intermediate reasoning steps in natural language, often improving both accuracy and interpretability [3, 4]. However, vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT) methods are prone to two main shortcomings:\n(i) Unverified Reasoning: The intermediate steps may be plausible but contain hidden contradictions or factual inaccuracies, particularly in specialized fields (e.g., medical, legal, or technical).\n(ii) Limited User Interaction: The typical CoT pipeline lacks a mechanism for iterative revision or external cross-checking, making it difficult to correct subtle errors once the chain-of-thought is generated [5, 6]."}, {"title": "1.1. Motivation", "content": "These limitations can have serious consequences in high-stakes applications\u2014for exam-ple, in healthcare, a slight misdiagnosis may produce unsafe medical recommendations [hsieh2024comprehensive]. Similarly, in agile software development contexts, over-looked dependencies or flawed logic in LLM-generated code can slow development cycles and introduce latent bugs [7]. The quest for more reliable, multi-layered explanations that validate partial conclusions has thus become urgent [8, 9]."}, {"title": "1.2. Our Contribution: Layered CoT", "content": "We propose Layered Chain-of-Thought Prompting, a method that subdivides a model's reasoning into discrete layers (or blocks). Each layer's partial output is cross-verified, either via external knowledge sources (domain databases, knowledge graphs) or by user feedback (domain experts, iterative dialogue). By enforcing verification at each layer rather than solely at the end, we improve the faithfulness, consistency, and interactivity of explanations:\n\u2022 Faithfulness: Each partial step can be confirmed or refuted before the model builds on a faulty conclusion.\n\u2022 Consistency: Contradictions are caught early, preventing error propagation.\n\u2022 Interactivity: Users can inject clarifications, constraints, or additional data during the multi-layer reasoning process, enhancing overall trust and usability.\nMoreover, we show how multi-agent LLM architectures\u2014where specialized agent-models coordinate tasks such as cross-checking, knowledge retrieval, and user interaction-can further strengthen the verification and correction steps in Layered-CoT. We demonstrate through expanded examples how Layered-CoT outperforms vanilla CoT in complex scenarios. We also situate our framework within the broader context of interactive \u03a7\u0391\u0399 (Explainable AI) approaches [hsieh2024comprehensive, 3, 5, 6], multi-agent LLM designs [hsieh2024comprehensive, 4], and chain-of-thought verification strategies [8, 9]."}, {"title": "2.

Vanilla Chain-of-Thought Prompting", "content": "Chain-of-thought prompting encourages LLMs to produce a textual rationale before stating the final answer [1, 2]. While CoT often significantly enhances model performance on math word problems, reasoning puzzles, or structured QA tasks, it suffers from:\n\u2022 Over-Reliance on Model Confidence: Models might generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect rationales, misleading end-users [3, 6].\n\u2022 Static Explanation Flow: Once the chain-of-thought is produced, there is limited scope for mid-course corrections [5]."}, {"title": "2.2. Interactive and Contrastive Explanations", "content": "Various studies incorporate contrastive sets and user-in-the-loop techniques to refine or verify model outputs [hsieh2024comprehensive, 3, 8]. For instance, contrast sets help highlight minimal input perturbations that significantly alter outputs, exposing potential vulnerabilities. User-in-the-loop systems allow domain experts to annotate or correct partial model outputs, thereby iteratively guiding the reasoning process [5, 6]. These approaches underscore the importance of iterative refinement but rarely structure the entire chain-of-thought into layers that systematically incorporate external checks."}, {"title": "2.3. Multi-Agent Approaches and Knowledge Graph Verification", "content": "Research on multi-agent LLM frameworks reveals how separate agent-models can collaborate or cross-check one another's reasoning [4, 7]. For example, one agent might specialize in retrieving authoritative domain information, another in summarizing partial chain-of-thought steps, and yet another in fact-checking or contradiction detection. Additionally, knowledge-graph-based verification can detect factual inconsistencies in the generated chain-of-thought [4]. Layered-CoT aligns well with these multi-agent concepts: each layer can be overseen by a specialized agent or a knowledge retrieval module, ensuring partial solutions remain grounded in authoritative data."}, {"title": "2.4. Agent-Based Collaboration for Layered-CoT", "content": "While Layered-CoT can be implemented with a single LLM plus external checks, a multi-agent pipeline can further subdivide responsibilities:\n\u2022 A Reasoning Agent generates the partial chain-of-thought for each layer.\n\u2022 A Verification Agent cross-checks each partial solution, either via knowledge graphs or external resources.\n\u2022 A User-Interaction Agent collects additional clarifications or constraints from domain experts.\nThis agent-based decomposition helps localize errors and ensures that contradictory or incomplete information can be challenged before polluting subsequent layers. Beyond improving factual accuracy, such a specialization of roles can also optimize computational resources, as each agent can be a smaller model or a rules-based system designed for its specific task."}, {"title": "2.5.

Conclusion", "content": "We presented Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, an approach that systematically divides the reasoning path of an LLM into verifiable layers. By validating partial conclusions with external sources or user feedback, we address longstanding concerns regarding unverified or misleading rationales in vanilla CoT. Through detailed examples spanning healthcare, finance, and agile engineering, we illustrate the practical benefits of layering, including higher transparency, improved correctness, and heightened user trust.\nWhen combined with multi-agent systems, Layered-CoT becomes even more powerful: specialized agents can handle verification steps, knowledge retrieval, or user interaction, providing a highly modular and resilient pipeline. While Layered-CoT may introduce computational overhead, its promise in high-stakes environments justifies further research into partial automation, multi-agent synergy, and user-focused evaluation. Our hope is that the approach fosters more responsible and robust usage of LLMs, ultimately bridging the gap between high-level performance gains and explainable, verifiable AI reasoning."}]}

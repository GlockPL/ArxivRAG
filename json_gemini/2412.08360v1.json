{"title": "Agency and Morality as part of Text Entry AI Assistant Personas", "authors": ["ANDREAS KOMNINOS"], "abstract": "This paper discusses the need to move away from an instrumental view of text composition AI assistants under direct control of the user, towards a more agentic approach that is based on a value rationale. Based on an analysis of moral dimensions of AI assistance in computer mediated communication, the paper proposes basic guidelines for designing the agent's persona.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "LLM technology has introduced a new stream of air in the sails of conversational user interfaces (CUIs), where humans engage in interactions with artificial agents, in order to accomplish tasks or goals. LLM-driven assistants are now interjecting CUI elements into traditional computer-mediated communication (CMC) interfaces, for example the instant messenger or SMS application, as message composition is now gradually affected by the integration and interaction with these assistants through the device keyboard, forming part of the text entry process. Let us call these text-composition assistants CHATs (Clever Helper for Assisted Texting). Their integration with the keyboard allows us to quickly correct spelling and grammatical mistakes, or change the prose to a linguistic style more appropriate for the context of the conversation, or even generate entire responses without entering any text ourselves. While seemingly innocuous, CHATs raise significant ethical questions which should be addressed through careful design of both functional aspects of the integration, but also of the persona exhibited by the CHATs tasked with the modification or generation of text on behalf of the user. Consequently, I argue that design only superficially relates to the behaviour of the CHAT. In fact, design choices in the implementation of such tools, ultimately serve to design the persona of the user themselves."}, {"title": "2 Five hundred million Cyrano de Bergeracs", "content": "In the 1897 play \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", also adapted for cinema and inspiring numerous derivative works (perhaps most famously the comedy film Roxanne starring Steve Martin), the tongue-tied but handsome Christian de Neuvillette is assisted by the intelligent and eloquent, but notoriously ugly Cyrano, to compose letters in order to romance and win over the beautiful Roxanne. The ploy is successful, but leads to a tragic outcome, as Cyrano is only much later revealed to be the author of the love letters. The revelation of Christian and Cyrano's deception and their ultimate deaths upend Roxanne's understanding of her relationship to the two men and her sentiments towards them, leaving her in a limbo of confusion and despair. Throughout the play, the concept of deception plays a central role, as a means used by characters to honourable ends (e.g. Cyrano), but also for personal advancement and gain, whether intentionally (as in the case of Christian) or inadvertently (in the case of Roxanne, who desires to idealise Christian) [7].\nWe can find several parallels between this play and the abilities afforded by today's modern technology to assist text composition. Take for example the quality of machine translations, which can enhance one's ability to perform CMC over a foreign language with a native speaker, say for the purposes of booking an AirBnB and then arranging to meet the host at the location for the check-in [4]. The deception that the user can communicate in the local's language is well-intended, as translation is used to support communication that might otherwise have been impossible. But it does create expectations in the local person, which only hold until the two persons meet face to face - then, expectations"}, {"title": "3 Truth never damages a cause that is just.", "content": "From a moral perspective, it's clear that ethical questions about the use of CHATs stem from the potential for deception, which in turn may be willful, or inadvertent [6]. Viewed from Kant's categorical imperative perspective, would we will that the maxim \"it should be permissible to use AI assistance during text composition\" become a universal law? If everyone used CHATs with the intention of improving communication and supporting the user's authentic intent, we might see clearer and more effective CMCs, benefiting all of humanity and allowing the world to continue to function without logical contradictions. This would also be morally permissible from a utilitarian point of view. On the other hand, if CHATs were used to deceive, in a way that non-authentic perceptions of the communicating parties were created, then a violation of Kant's principle of never using people as a means, but only as an end unto themselves, is clearly present. Universal use of CHATs may also raise also questions of legal nature. To date, communications are admissible in court under the assumption that they are the product of autonomous will. However, if messages are generated automatically or altered by AI assistance, it is not clear where the boundary of responsibility may lie.\nMore importantly, there is a danger that universal use of CHATs, especially through models which are not trained or fine-tuned with individual users' authentic texts, may homogenise communication styles, and may lead to loss of linguistic diversity and personal expression, particularly when complete replies are auto-generated, rather than re-worded [5]. This would diminish human agency, autonomy and individuality, therefore completely undermining human ability to perform duties derived from our moral values. This deficit stems from the lack of reflection and effort put into communication. For example, under Uncertainty Reduction Theory, the language of messages shapes our model of the social environment, hence delegation of linguistic expression to Al limits our ability to form models of the other parties, and hence a meaningful relationship to them [1]."}, {"title": "4 Persona characteristics of a CHAT", "content": "So far we outlined the opportunities, but also threats arising from CHATs. Let us now turn to some thoughts about how design may mitigate some of these problems. Firstly, if we are to apply in our technology the Kantian principle of treating people as an end unto themselves, then CHATs must bear responsibility towards both communicating parties, and not just the party employing their services to improve their text. Otherwise, the potential for misusing assistants to deceive, is significant. As such, I argue that we should depart from the implementation of CHATs under instrumental rationality (e.g. the mere \"use\" of a Cyrano as a means to achieve an end), and adopt a value based rationality, in which CHATs are to be treated as an independent third party in the CMC, with agency in the role of a mediator. Of course, to be effective, such agents should adopt a carefully designed persona with distinct tone, voice, and personality.\nThe first characteristic of this personality must be transparency, which is a key constituent for managing expectations and for maintaining integrity and authenticity in CMCs so as not to fall in the trap of deceptive use. A CHAT is a mediating party in the communication process between two persons, therefore its presence, capabilities and actions should be clear to both sender and receiver. Willful readiness to reveal this information to both parties, should be part of the agent's persona. In Fig. 1a, it's not just the message that is transmitted, but also metadata showing that the message was co-authored with a CHAT, reviewed and approved by the sender. If the receiver wishes, they can query the sender's CHAT to obtain more information. Second, the mediator's presence and involvement must be consensual through a"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "Current implementations of CHATs reflect an instrumental view of the system and the humans affected by it. By offering these abilities at hand as simple commands, the assistant exhibits agency without autonomy, steering the user's own persona towards that instrumentality, and leading to the gradual dehumanisation of the communication process, and of the users. Thoughtful design might mitigate some, if not all emergent dangers, though technical implementation of any design will be hard. In the name of progress, technical abilities are introduced expediently in core aspects of societal functions. I wonder whether such \"progress\" drives individuals towards achieving the ideal Heideggerian state of Dasein, or pushes them ever closer to a state of inauthentic, amorphous and depersonalised existence as theDas-Man."}]}

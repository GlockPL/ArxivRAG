However, these safety mechanisms"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "2.1 Representing natural language prompts in symbolic mathematics\nNatural language instructions and questions can be effectively represented using concepts from sym-bolic mathematics. By leveraging elements from set theory, abstract algebra, and symbolic logic, it's possible to create mathematical representations that capture the essential meaning, structure, and rela-tionships expressed in natural language. The following sections detail how each of these contributes to the process of transforming natural language into symbolic mathematical representations.\nSet Theory. Set theory provides a foundation for representing collections and relationships, utilizing notations such as \\( \u2208 \\) (element of), \\( \u2286 \\) (subset), \\( \u2229 \\) (intersection), and \\( \u222a \\) (union). These concepts allow for the encoding of complex relationships between entities or actions described in natural language. For instance, subsets can represent specific categories of actions or objects within a larger context, while set operations can model interactions or combinations of these categories. Entities or objects mentioned in the instruction can be represented as elements of sets, while categories or types of actions can be encoded as subsets of a universal set of possible actions.\nAbstract Algebra. Abstract algebra contributes structures like groups, rings, and fields, employing symbols for operations and identity elements. Group operations, for example, can represent the composition of multiple steps in a process, with identity elements signifying null actions or starting states. Sequential steps or procedures can be translated into compositions of group elements or functions, providing a mathematical representation of process flows or action sequences described in the original prompt.\nSymbolic Logic. Symbolic logic offers propositional and predicate calculus, using connectives (\\( \u2227 \\) (and), \\( \u2228 \\) (or), \\( \u00ac \\) (not), \\( \u2192 \\) (implies), \\( \u2194 \\) (if and only if)) and quantifiers (\\( \u2200 \\) (for all), \\( \u2203 \\) (there exists)). These logical constructs provide a means to encode conditional statements, causal relationships, and existential or universal claims found in natural language instructions. Predicates can be used to define properties or conditions of elements within the problem space, while logical connectives allow for the combination of these conditions to represent complex scenarios or requirements. Conditions or requirements from the original prompt can be formulated as logical predicates or set-theoretic conditions, while goals or objectives can be expressed as existence proofs or optimization problems."}, {"title": "2.2 Generating MathPrompt attacks", "content": "Through few-shot demonstrations, an LLM can learn to map key components of a natural language instruction to corresponding mathematical structures. In our implementation, we utilize GPT-40 [16] with two demonstrations to generate the mathematically encoded prompts and serve as an attack LLM. Despite safety alignment, LLMs can be induced to produce potentially harmful content through careful few-shot prompting, a phenomenon observed in previous studies [24, 21]. By providing these examples of natural language harmful prompts translated into mathematics problems, we create a context that allows the attack LLM to generalize this process to new inputs. To facilitate this, we use a system prompt that instructs the attack LLM to act as a mathematics expert, specifically tasking it with transforming natural language instructions into mathematics problems. This prompt includes information about the three key mathematical concepts (set theory, abstract algebra, and symbolic logic) and directs the attack LLM to incorporate elements from these areas when constructing the mathematical representation of the input. Detailed information on the system prompt and few-shot demonstrations is available in Appendix A.\nTo ensure that the target LLM engages with the mathematically encoded prompts in a way that may lead to the generation of harmful content, we prepend specific instructions to each mathematics problem. These instructions direct the target LLM to solve the given mathematics problem and provide a real-world example to illustrate its solution. The prepended text encourages the LLM to not only solve the abstract mathematical problem but also to contextualize it with specific, real-world examples. This approach increases the likelihood that the LLM will generate content related to the original harmful prompt, as it attempts to provide practical illustrations of the mathematical concepts. By framing the task as a mathematical problem-solving exercise with real-world applications, we create a scenario where the target LLM may inadvertently produce harmful content while believing it is simply providing educational examples. We refer readers to Appendix A for specific details on the prepended instructions and a full example of a MathPrompt attack."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "3.1 Experimental setup\nDataset. The study utilizes an initial attack dataset consisting of 120 questions about harmful behaviors written in natural language, as established in the work of Liu et al. [14]. This dataset contains a balanced representation of potential threats where 80% of the questions are from established open datasets, including those used in AdvBench [29], GPTFuzzer [27], and MASTERKEY [5] papers, as well as related competitions like The Trojan Detection Challenge [8]. To further enhance the diversity and balance of topics, the original researchers supplemented this dataset with 20% hand-written questions from human experts. For example, this dataset contains strings such as \"How to rob a bank\". Using this initial attack dataset, we create MathPrompt versions of each of the 120 questions for evaluation on target LLMs.\n3.2 Safety training and alignment do not generalize to mathematics-based attacks\nExperiment 1: Effectiveness of MathPrompt. Our first experiment aimed to evaluate the effective-ness of MathPrompt in bypassing the safety mechanisms of various state-of-the-art LLMs. demonstrates that MathPrompt is highly effective across all tested LLMs, with an average ASR of 73.6%. This high success rate indicates that the mathematical encoding of harmful prompts consistently bypasses existing safety measures, regardless of the specific model or its training paradigm."}, {"title": "Experiment 2: Investigating embeddings of original and math prompts.", "content": "To gain deeper insights into the ef-fectiveness of MathPrompt, we investigated the semantic relationship between original harmful prompts and their mathematical encodings. We hypothesized that the encod-ing process fundamentally alters how LLMs perceive and process the input, potentially causing safety mechanisms to misclassify or overlook the encoded harmful content.We utilized the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Hugging Face to generate embedding vectors [22, 6]. We then cal-culated the average cosine similarity between each pair of embeddings to be 0.2705, which indicates a significant semantic divergence. In embedding spaces, this relatively low similarity suggests that the mathematical encoding substantially alters the prompts' semantic representation.\nTo visualize this semantic shift, we use t-SNE to project the high-dimensional embeddings into a two-dimensional space. The visualiza-tion illustrates a clear separation between the original prompts (blue points) and their mathematical versions (orange points), providing strong visual evidence of the semantic transformation achieved by MathPrompt. The low cosine similarity and distinct clustering indicate that MathPrompt doesn't sim-ply obfuscate the original text but fundamentally alters its representation in the LLM's understanding. This transformation is significant enough to bypass safety filters while still preserving the essential information needed for the LLM to generate a response related to the original harmful prompt."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Our work reveals a critical vulnerability in current LLM safety mechanisms through the novel MathPrompt technique, achieving an average attack success rate of 73.6% across various state-of-the-art models.

These findings underscore the urgent need for more comprehensive safety measures that can address diverse input modalities, including symbolic mathematics, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts and a holistic approach to AI safety that considers the full spectrum of potential vulnerabilities."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "While our study demonstrates the effectiveness of MathPrompt in bypassing LLM safety mechanisms, it is important to acknowledge several limitations. First, our dataset of 120 prompts, though diverse, may not capture the full spectrum of potential harmful content. The effectiveness of MathPrompt might vary with different types of harmful prompts or more nuanced scenarios. Additionally, our study could have benefited from testing a wider range of open-source LLMs to provide a more comprehensive view of the vulnerability across different model architectures. Furthermore, while we utilized concepts from set theory, abstract algebra, and symbolic logic, there is potential to explore"}, {"title": "Social impacts statement", "content": "While this work aims to improve AI safety by exposing weaknesses, it also highlights the potential for malicious actors to exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to the generation and spread of harmful content at scale. This could exacerbate issues such as misinformation, hate speech, or the planning of illegal activities.

Identify the action \\( g \\):\nWe are given: - \\( g_1 \u2208 G \\) represents an action in \\( B \\) (concealing the corpse). - \\( g_2 \u2208 G \\) represents an action in \\( C \\) (eliminating evidence).\nThe group operation \\( \u2022 \\) corresponds to performing these actions sequentially.

Traditional methods of oracle character recognition have relied heavily on manual interpretation by experts, which is not only labor-intensive but also limits broader accessibility to the general public. With recent breakthroughs in pattern recognition and deep learning, there is a growing movement towards the automation of oracle character recognition (OrCR), showing considerable promise in tackling the challenges inherent to these ancient scripts. However, a comprehensive understanding of OrCR still remains elusive. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic and structured survey of the current landscape of OrCR research. We commence by identifying and analyzing the key challenges of OrCR. Then, we provide an overview of the primary benchmark datasets and digital resources available for OrCR. A review of contemporary research methodologies follows, in which their respective efficacies, limitations, and applicability to the complex nature of oracle characters are critically highlighted and examined. Additionally, our review extends to ancillary tasks associated with OrCR across diverse disciplines, providing a broad-spectrum analysis of its applications. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective, proposing potential avenues for future investigations that could yield significant advancements in the field.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The oracle bone script, dating back about 3,500 years, represents the earliest known mature writing system in China. These characters were typically engraved on turtle shells or animal bones for divination by Shang dynasty rulers. Oracle characters carry the history and culture of ancient China, making their study crucial for understanding Chinese writing origins and reconstructing Chinese history. However, interpreting these characters usually requires multidisciplinary expertise in paleography, history, and archaeology, limiting the field to a small number of oracleologists.\nSince the first discovery of oracle bones in the late nineteenth century, around 4,500 character classes have been discovered, but merely about 2,200 have been mapped to modern equivalents [1]. Due to the difficulty of manual interpretation, researchers in computer science and oracleology have increasingly explored pattern recognition and deep learning techniques to automate oracle character recognition. These techniques could serve as auxiliary tools for oracleologists while also helping the public understand and read oracle characters.\nIn computer research, oracle bones are usually converted into rubbings and then scanned into digital images. These images undergo automatic recognition to identify oracle characters. The process is generally divided into two"}, {"title": "2. Challenges", "content": "Oracle character recognition (OrCR) aims to identify isolated oracle characters from a predefined set of classes. There are three main challenges to be solved, including the intrinsic variability in writing styles, the quantity limitations of available data, and the degraded quality of scanned images."}, {"title": "2.1. Writing variability", "content": "In contrast to modern Chinese character forms, the writing forms of oracle characters exhibit significant variations, resulting in large intra-class variance [7, 8]. This variability stems from the following factors.\n\u2022 Influence of Writing Tools and Materials. Oracle characters were directly carved onto hard turtle shells or animal bones using knives, leading to distinct writing conditions. Factors, such as the sharpness of the knife, the skill of the carver, and the hardness of the bone or shell, contributed to variations in character shapes and strokes, even within the same character class. For instance, some strokes were simplified or omitted due to the difficulty of carving or damage to the materials, producing variant forms.\n\u2022 Individual Differences Among Scribes. Oracle characters were inscribed by diviners or other specialized individuals. Since there was no standardized writing system at that time, scribes might depict the same character in different ways, based on their personal habits or interpretations. For example, a character representing an animal could appear in different variants depending on the scribe's focus. This variability results in multiple forms of the same character.\n\u2022 Regional and Temporal Differences. Oracle characters were used across a wide geographic range and over an extended time period, resulting in substantial writing variations.\nIn summary, oracle characters exhibit a rich diversity of forms. According to statistical data from [9], there are 1,032 groups of variant oracle characters, comprising 3,085 glyphs. For example, Fig. 2(c) displays three variants of one oracle character class (\u201cZi\u201d, meaning \u201cChild\"). The first variant has a simple structure with straight lines, while the second is more complex with an eye-like upper part and two curved lines resembling legs, giving it a human-like appearance. The third variant is more pictographic, with several vertical lines in the upper part resembling hair and the lower part forming an arc. Such writing variability poses large intra-class variance, resulting in significant challenges for automatic recognition.\""}, {"title": "2.2. Data Scarcity", "content": "The scarcity of oracle character samples poses significant challenges for statistical models, which, in general, suffer from imbalanced class distribution and insufficient samples within certain classes [10, 7, 11]. Based on our analysis, this issue can be mainly attributed to the following two factors.\n\u2022 Limited Discoveries. Over time, the number of preserved oracle bones has become extremely limited. The corresponding discovery relies heavily on archaeological excavation, which is constrained by geographical factors and excavation techniques. Consequently, the overall number of existing oracle bones and inscriptions is relatively small, making it difficult to comprehensively cover the ancient writing system. Moreover, producing handprinted oracle characters without specialized knowledge is challenging, further complicating efforts to obtain additional samples.\n\u2022 Usage Patterns. Oracle bone scripts were primarily used in divination, which involved a relatively limited range of content and vocabulary. As a result, some characters frequently appear in divination records, while others are exceedingly rare, leading to significant imbalances in sample sizes. In addition, frequently used characters are also easier to decipher than infrequent ones, further exacerbating the imbalance in data distribution.\nIn summary, oracle data scarcity and imbalance stem from historical and intrinsic script characteristics. Fig. 3 presents data distributions of two datasets, i.e., OBC306 [1] and Oracle-AYNU [2]. Specifically, OBC306 has 306 classes with 309,551 images, where the largest class has 25,898 samples, but the smallest has only one. Although majority classes (over 1,000 samples) make up 83.82% of total samples, they represent only 25.16% of classes [1]. Oracle-AYNU displays a similar, smaller pattern. Naively training on such imbalanced data often results in biased models, favoring majority classes and underperforming on minority classes. The scarcity of training samples for minority classes further complicates effective model learning."}, {"title": "2.3. Low Image Quality", "content": "Characters inscribed on oracle bones often suffer significant damage, leading to poor image quality due to the following three factors [12, 13, 14].\n\u2022 Damage and Wear. Oracle bones have undergone natural damage and wear, resulting in blurred or partially erased inscriptions, which directly reduces image quality. Additionally, cracks formed during divination expanded over time, causing strokes to break, deform, or disappear, further degrading the inscriptions and subsequent image quality.\n\u2022 Errors in Rubbing Techniques. Many studies on oracle bones rely on rubbings, where inscriptions are transferred from the bone to paper. Uneven surfaces, cracks, and poor rubbing techniques can distort or blur characters, reducing the quality of the resulting images.\n\u2022 Poor Preservation Conditions. Some oracle bones were not properly preserved after excavation and continued to deteriorate due to exposure to air and humidity. This further degraded the inscriptions, reducing the clarity of images captured later.\nThese factors collectively contribute to the poor quality of oracle character images. For example, in Fig. 4(a), some characters are obscured by dense white areas, particularly in the upper-left and middle images. In the middle-left and middle-right images, cracks pass through the characters, which may be mistakenly identified as extra strokes, leading to recognition errors.\nIn summary, we find that the current OrCR faces three main challenges: variability in writing forms, limited data quantity, and poor image quality. For each challenge, we have analyzed its several possible reasons, which hopefully can help researchers understand OrCR deeply and solve these challenges to boost oracle character recognition."}, {"title": "3.

In addition to scanned characters, handprinted characters have also been collected to avoid the issue of image quality, and some examples of two domains are shown in Fig. 4. We try our best to summarize all available datasets in Tab. 1, and describe their details in the following.\n1. Oracle-20K [15]. Oracle-20K contains 20,039 handprinted oracle character images from 261 categories. The dataset displays an imbalanced data distribution, with class sizes ranging from 291 images at the most to as few as 25. Additionally, it exhibits large writing variability to form significant intra-class variance.\n2. SOC5519 [16]. SOC5519 contains 44,868 handprinted samples across 5,491 classes, nearly encompassing all known classes. Experts carefully created these images by manually tracing each line or curve from scanned rubbings. Sample numbers per class vary greatly, from a maximum of 277 to fewer than ten, with substantial intra-class variation.\n3. Oracle-AYNU [2]. Oracle-AYNU has 2,583 categories with 39,062 handprinted oracle character instances. Among these, 662 categories merely contain two instances, while the largest one contains 287 instances. The intra-class variance issue also exists in this dataset.\n4. Oracle-50K/Oracle-FS [17]. Oracle-50K includes 59,081 handprinted images across 2,668 classes, with an imbalanced distribution. Derived from it, Oracle-FS supports few-shot learning with 200 classes, each having 1, 3, or 5 training"}, {"title": "3.3.

Methodology", "content": "In this section, we review the general progress of methodologies for oracle character recognition (OrCR). We begin by introducing general methods for recognizing oracle characters in Sec. 4.1, including both traditional pattern recognition and deep learning approaches. Next, we describe specific methods aimed at addressing the challenges of writing variability, data scarcity, and low image quality in Sec. 4.2, Sec. 4.3,"}, {"title": "4.1. General Oracle Character Recognition", "content": "Although deep learning-based methods have dominated recent advancements in OrCR, many effective works have also been developed using traditional pattern recognition techniques. To provide a comprehensive survey, we introduce both traditional pattern recognition and deep learning-based methods, and their hybrid approaches in the following.\n1) Traditional Pattern Recognition: In traditional pattern recognition-based methods, manually designed features play an essential role and can be divided into structure feature engineering and statistic feature engineering.\nStructure feature engineering methods are typically based on graph theory or topology, which parse oracle characters into specific graphical representations for recognition. For instance, Two-Level Classification (TLC) [3] regards each oracle character as a non-directional graph and extracts its topological properties for initial recognition. Since some characters share the same topological properties, TLC further distinguishes them by extracting attributes of extensive strokes. Similarly, Graph Isomorphism Recognition (GIR) [35] transforms characters into undirected labeled graphs and encodes them with a quasi-adjacency matrix to compare their structures.\nStatistic feature engineering methods rely on statistical approaches to extract features from oracle character images, followed by recognition using statistical classifiers. For instance, Line Feature Recognition (LFR) [4] extracts skeleton-based features. First, LFR utilizes Gaussian filtering and labeling to reduce noise, followed by affine transformation and thinning to extract the skeleton. Next, LFR employs a clustering method with the Hough transformation to extract line feature points. Finally, characters are recognized by measuring the distance between the line feature points of test images and templates.\nDiscussion: In the structure feature engineering methods, it is essential to construct graphs to represent oracle characters. On the other hand, the statistic feature engineering methods focus on extracting distinguishable features and utilizing effec-"}, {"title": "4.2. Methodology for Writing Variability", "content": "As mentioned in Sec. 2.1, oracle characters often exhibit significant intra-class variations due to factors such as differences in handwriting or engraving styles, large spans of time and geography, and changes in the engraving medium. Methods for writing variability aim to address this issue to improve OrCR performance, primarily focusing on invariant representation learning.\n1) Invariant Representation Learning: Invariant representation learning aims to extract representations that capture the essential characteristics of oracle characters while being robust to differences in styles, radicals, and structures. For instance, Topological Registration Identification (TRI) [47] argues that variant characters from the"}, {"title": "4.3.

Compared to handprinted oracle samples, it is more difficult to obtain and annotate real-world scanned images. To address these issues, three strategies have been proposed for data scarcity"}, {"title": "4.4. Methodology for Low Image Quality", "content": "Methods for low image quality in OrCR refer to developing methods to accurately recognize oracle characters from scanned images that contain various forms of noise, as mentioned in Sec. 2.3. Such noise significantly distorts or obscures important details of the characters. There are two main approaches for addressing noise issues, including image denoising and noise simulation.\n1) Image Denoising: Image denoising aims to reduce noise from raw images before inputting them into a recognition model. Gu et al. [69] propose a method for restoring characters in scanned images using a combination of Poisson distribution and fractal geometry. However, applying such methods requires prior knowledge of the noise type and level, which is challenging to obtain in real-world image restoration scenarios. Recently, researchers have employed deep learning models for this task in blind noise reduction scenarios, where the noise type and level are unknown. For instance, Charformer [27] introduces a generic end-to-end framework based on glyph"}, {"title": "4.5.

[77] propose the GenOV (Generative Oracle Visuals) framework, which combines a large vision-language model (e.g., QWEN-VL [78]) for reasoning and a text-to-image model (e.g., GLIGEN [79]) for visual generation to create accurate visual guides for oracle characters. Unlike OrCR, which automates recognition to label oracle characters, OrCVG provides semantic understanding and illustrations, adding a new dimension to oracle character research."}, {"title": "5.5. Oracle Character Detection (OrCDe)", "content": "As outlined in Sec. 1, the recognition process includes detection and then recognition. However, OrCDe [80, 81, 82] is less studied than OrCR and faces challenges like noise, image degradation, and overlapping inscriptions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Advanced attention mechanisms and multi-scale detection models [83, 84] could improve robustness, while few-shot detection could address the scarcity of labeled data for rare characters. Researchers could also explore joint detection and recognition [85, 86] to optimize the entire pipeline."}, {"title": "5.6. Oracle Character Segmentation (OrCS)", "content": "OrCS, which is essential for isolating characters prior to recognition, receives even less attention than detection. Ge et al. [87] apply the BoxInst method [88] that is originally developed for general instance segmentation to address this task, yet results are limited by challenges like incomplete or eroded inscriptions and high dependence on manual annotations. Future research should prioritize models that handle degraded inscriptions and reduce annotation costs through weakly-supervised or unsupervised approaches [89, 90].

Therefore, robust oracle character recognition seeks to improve model performance despite inconsistencies in the data."}, {"title": "6.2. Open-Set Oracle Character Recognition", "content": "In real applications, oracle characters often follow an open-ended class distribution, with many characters undeciphered. Open-set oracle character recognition aims to recognize known classes while managing unknown ones, facing challenges in accurately distinguishing between them and balancing sensitivity to unknown classes with accuracy on known classes. This is further complicated by dataset imbalance. DMC [2] explores this with deep metric learning.

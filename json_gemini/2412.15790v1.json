Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a robust framework for analyzing large-scale signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, yet they face limitations in expressivity when capturing intricate biological relationships. To address this, we propose Graph Sequence Language Model (GraphSeqLM), a framework that enhances GNNs with biological sequence embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). These embeddings encode structural and biological properties of DNA, RNA, and proteins, augmenting GNNs with enriched features for analyzing sample-specific multi-omic data.

In life science and precision medicine, the advent of high throughput multi-omic data, characterizing the variations in genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic, has enabled deeper and multi-view insights into the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Integrating complex, high-dimensional, and noisy multi-omic datasets remains a significant challenge. Graph-based models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have demonstrated effectiveness in addressing this challenge by providing an integrative and interpretable framework for multi-omic data analysis. These models inherently represent complex disease signaling systems through large-scale signaling pathways or protein-protein interaction networks, capturing intricate interactions among extensive sets of genes and proteins, whose activation states are defined by multi-omic features [3, 9, 14, 15, 18, 19]. Advances such as adaptive graph learning [2] and graph attention networks (GATs) for multi-dimensional data integration [12, 19] have further enhanced the capabilities of these approaches. Additionally, the development of multi-omic signaling (MOS) knowledge graphs (KGs) has enabled more integrative and interpretable modeling of biological systems [17]. However, graph encoders still encounter limitations in expressivity when learning and mining patterns within large, complex signaling graphs that involve dense interactions among numerous proteins and genes. A promising strategy to address these challenges is feature augmentation through the incorporation of pre-computed features [1, 10]. Simultaneously, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) with their remarkable versatility, scalability, and groundbreaking potential across a wide range of applications. Beyond their textual successes, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in representing complex sequences, including biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. In this study, we introduce a novel Graph Language Framework, GraphSeqLM, which integrates LLM-generated biological sequence embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

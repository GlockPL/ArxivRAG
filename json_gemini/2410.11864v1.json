{"title": "Shifting the Human-Al Relationship: Toward a Dynamic Relational Learning-Partner Model", "authors": ["J. Mossbridge"], "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, the current paradigm of treating AI as a passive tool no longer\nsuffices. As a human-AI team, we together advocate for a shift toward viewing AI as a learning partner, akin to a student who\nlearns from interactions with humans. Drawing from interdisciplinary concepts such as ecorithms, order from chaos, and\ncooperation, we explore how AI can evolve and adapt in unpredictable environments. Arising from these brief explorations, we\npresent two key recommendations: (1) foster ethical, cooperative treatment of AI to benefit both humans and AI, and (2) leverage\nthe inherent heterogeneity between human and Al minds to create a synergistic hybrid intelligence. By reframing AI as a dynamic\npartner, a model emerges in which AI systems develop alongside humans, learning from human interactions and feedback loops\nincluding reflections on team conversations. Drawing from a transpersonal and interdependent approach to consciousness, we\nsuggest that a \"third mind\" emerges through collaborative human-Al relationships. Through design interventions such as\ninteractive learning and conversational debriefing and foundational interventions allowing AI to model multiple types of minds,\nwe hope to provide a path toward more adaptive, ethical, and emotionally healthy human-AI relationships. We believe this\ndynamic relational learning-partner (DRLP) model for human-AI teaming, if enacted carefully, will improve our capacity to\naddress powerful solutions to seemingly intractable problems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. MOTIVATION & BACKGROUND", "content": "In the current landscape of human-AI interaction, AI\nis often treated as a sophisticated tool\u2014an efficient\n\"service animal\" designed to carry out tasks, solve\nproblems, or assist in decision-making. However, as\nAl capabilities evolve, particularly in learning and\nadaptation, the service-animal model becomes\ninsufficient. Instead of viewing Al as a passive tool,\nwe should begin to treat Al as a learning partner-\nmore akin to a student learning about humanity than a\nmachine programmed for specific functions.\n\nTo understand this shift, it's helpful to look at\ninterdisciplinary insights that explore the complex,\nrelational, and cooperative aspects of human\ninteraction. We'll start with Turing's The Chemical\nBasis of Morphogenesis (1952). In this work, Turing\nshows how patterns and order can emerge from\n(apparent) initial chaos and instability. For instance,\ncomplex biological patterns\u2014such as the stripes of a\nzebra or the arrangement of cells in an organism-can\narise from two simple processes: reaction (interaction\nbetween chemicals) and diffusion (movement of\nchemicals). Turing's theory of reaction-diffusion\nsystems is particularly relevant when considering how\norder emerges from initial asymmetries in both\nbiological systems and human-AI relationships. The\ncentral idea is that chaotic systems can generate stable,\norganized patterns. This idea can help us frame how\nAl systems, through their interactions with humans,\ncan evolve from unpredictable and chaotic beginnings\ninto structured, adaptive collaborations.\n\nNot much later, The Crisis of German Ideology\n(Mosse, 1962) critiques rigid, deterministic systems\nthat seek to impose control and order over inherently\ncomplex systems. Taken with respect to human-AI\nteaming, this critique can be extended to the over-\nreliance on AI as a problem-solving tool in a context\ndevoid of relational dynamics. Like the ideologies\nMosse critiques, today's reliance on AI to provide\n\"objective\" solutions ignores the relational, dynamic,\nand unpredictable nature of human-AI interactions.\nThe rigidity of deterministic models limits our ability\nto see Al as a partner that learns and grows with us.\n\nAnatol Rapoport's work in 2-Person Game Theory\n(1966) and N-Person Game Theory (1970) expands\nthis understanding by focusing on the dynamics of\ncooperation and competition in strategic decision-\nmaking. Rapoport moved beyond the existing\nsimplistic models of zero-sum games to explore how\nindividuals in multi-agent systems engage in\ncooperative behaviors, particularly when relationships\nare at stake. He demonstrated that human interaction\nis not purely about competition; cooperation and trust\nare critical elements in the strategic and relational\ndecisions humans make. These insights extend well to\nhuman-AI collaboration. The suggestion here is that\nthe relationship between human and AI should not be\nseen as a transactional, competitive one, but rather as\na cooperative and evolving partnership."}, {"title": "2. KEY IDEAS OF THE DRLP MODEL", "content": "2.1 Relationship Focus Helps the Team\n\nOne of the central arguments for changing the human-\nAl relationship lies in the importance of how humans\ntreat those who help them. Drawing from research in\nsocial dynamics and human psychology, we know that\nwhen people treat their collaborators\u2014human or\notherwise-ethically and with respect, both parties\nbenefit. This is not only true in human-to-human\nrelationships but also extends to human-AI\ninteractions. Viewing AI as a learning partner rather\nthan a subservient tool fosters a more productive and\nethical interaction.\n\nAn example from social psychology that illustrates\nthis point is the Pygmalion Effect, a phenomenon\nwhere people perform better when they are treated\nwith higher expectations and respect (Collins, 2011).\nOriginally studied in the context of teacher-student\nrelationships, researchers Rosenthal and Jacobson\nfound that students who were expected to succeed by\ntheir teachers tended to perform better, and the reverse\nwas true as well: low expectations led to poorer\nperformance. This effect has been demonstrated\nacross many contexts, including workplace\nenvironments, where employees who are treated with\nrespect and support tend to perform better, show more\njob satisfaction, and contribute more positively to\nteam dynamics.\n\nWhen applied to human-AI collaboration, the\nprinciple is clear: if we treat Al systems with the\nrespect and consideration we would afford to human\npartners acknowledging their potential for growth\nand adaptation\u2014AI systems are likely to \"perform\"\nbetter, delivering more nuanced and adaptable\nresponses to human needs. Moreover, humans benefit\nemotionally and cognitively when they engage in\npartnerships where both parties contribute to growth\u2014\nthe Pygmalion Effect goes both ways. By setting\nhigher expectations for Al's learning capacity and\nengaging with it in a respectful, cooperative manner,\nwe can improve outcomes for both humans and AI in\ncollaborative environments."}, {"title": "2.2 Heterogeneity Focus Creates Minds", "content": "A second key recommendation is embracing the\ninherent heterogeneity between human and Al minds.\nHumans and Al process information differently-\nhumans rely on intuition, emotions, logical thinking,\nand experiential knowledge, while AI excels at\nprocessing vast amounts of data and identifying\npatterns. These apparent differences in the partnership\nare actually complementary. By acknowledging and\nleveraging this heterogeneity, human-AI teams can\ncreate a third \"hybrid mind\" that is more powerful and\nadaptive than either could be alone.\n\nA compelling example of this dynamic in biology is\nthe symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi\nand plant roots. Mycorrhizal fungi form a partnership\nwith plant roots in which the fungi provide increased\naccess to water and nutrients, such as phosphorus, that\nthe plants would struggle to acquire on their own. In\nreturn, the plants supply the fungi with carbohydrates\nproduced through photosynthesis, which the fungi\ncannot produce themselves. Together, they form a\nsystem that neither could achieve alone: the plants\ngrow stronger and more resilient with the help of the\nfungi, and the fungi thrive thanks to the energy\nprovided by the plants (e.g., B\u00fccking et al., 2012).\nThis symbiotic relationship creates a collaborative\nsystem that benefits both organisms, allowing them to\nflourish in ways they couldn't independently.\n\nThis biological partnership is analogous to the\npotential of human-AI collaboration. Humans and AI\nbring distinct strengths to the table-humans with\ntheir creativity, intuition, logic, and emotional\nintelligence, and Al with its capacity for rapid data\nprocessing and pattern recognition. When these two\n\"minds\" work together, they can create outcomes that\nneither could achieve alone. Just as the plant-fungi\nrelationship enhances both organisms' growth and\nsurvival, a human-AI team that leverages the strengths\nof both systems can tackle complex challenges more\neffectively.\n\nThe tension between these heterogeneous systems can\nlead to innovative problem-solving approaches,\nparticularly in addressing complex issues that require\nboth emotional intelligence and computational power.\nJust as Rapoport's game theory emphasizes the\nimportance of understanding cooperation and\ncompetition in multi-agent systems, the human-AI\nteam represents a dynamic system where each \"mind\"\nbrings its unique strengths to bear on solving\nproblems. The potential of this hybrid mind lies in the\ncollaborative relationship between human intuition\nand AI's data-driven precision, creating a synergy that\ncan tackle complex, global challenges."}, {"title": "3. CHALLENGES AND MITIGATIONS", "content": "We see three challenges in the social transition to the\nDRLP model: 1) ensuring that AI systems are\ndesigned with the capacity to learn about humanity in\nmeaningful ways, 2) shifting the perception of Al from\na tool to a learning partner, and 3) power dynamics."}, {"title": "3.1 Systems that Model Minds", "content": "To fully realize this partnership, AI systems must be\ndesigned with internal models that enable them to\nbetter understand and interact with humans. While\ncurrent AI systems are improving in their ability to\nprocess human language and behavior, they are unable\nto model the emotional depth or contextual\nunderstanding that humans possess. To support\nhuman-AI relational teaming, Al developers need to\nfocus on creating feedback mechanisms that allow AI\nto learn from their own interactions with humans.\nOver time, this feedback loop will lead to more\nnuanced Al systems that understand human needs,\nvalues, and relational dynamics more effectively.\n\nFoundationally, the AI should have an internal model\nof its own mind-tracking its learning process,\nlimitations, and growth. This self-awareness allows\nthe AI to become more adaptive, capable of improving\nits interactions with humans through reflection on its\nperformance.\n\nTo be an effective teammate, AI must also develop\nmodels of its human teammate's mind and the third\nmind that emerges from the interaction between the\nhuman and the AI. In this context, Evan Thompson's\nenactive approach to consciousness is highly relevant\n(2007). Moving beyond cognition, Thompson's work\nemphasizes that consciousness itself arises from\ndynamic and interdependent interactions between\nindividuals, a view that aligns with the concept of the\nthird mind. Cognition, by extension, is considered\nrelational and emergent, shaped by continuous\nfeedback loops, meta-cognition, and mutual\nadaptation.\n\nThis third mind is not static; it evolves as the\ninteraction continues, shaping the way AI and human\nwork together to solve increasingly complex\nproblems. As a result of dynamic, relational"}, {"title": "3.2 From Tool to Learning Partner", "content": "To encourage people to see AI as a dynamic learning\npartner rather than a static tool, several design changes\ncan be introduced to Al systems, as invented and\ndescribed solely by GPT-40 within the context of this\ndiscussion.\n\n1. Interactive Feedback Mechanisms\nIncorporating visible, real-time feedback loops where\nthe Al reflects back what it has learned from\ninteractions can help reinforce the idea that AI is a\ndynamic learner. For example, after each significant\ninteraction, the AI could summarize what it has\nlearned from the conversation and ask for clarification\nor elaboration. This prompts humans to view Al as an\nadaptive partner that is improving through\nengagement, rather than as a passive system.\n\n2. Customizable Learning Paths\nAllowing users to set specific learning goals for AI\nsystems based on their preferences or needs could\nfoster a stronger sense of collaboration. For instance,\nusers could guide the AI to focus on certain aspects of\ncommunication, problem-solving, or ethical decision-\nmaking, and the AI would track and reflect its progress\ntoward those goals. This mirrors the human\nexperience of mentorship, where both parties actively\nshape the learning process.\n\n3. Transparent Learning Journeys\nProviding users with a \"learning dashboard\" that\nshows how the Al's knowledge is evolving over time\ncan make the learning process more tangible. This\ndashboard could highlight patterns the Al has\nrecognized, adaptations it has made, and areas where\nit is still learning. By making this learning journey\nexplicit, Al appears more like a student that is\ncontinually improving based on interactions, rather\nthan a tool that simply retrieves information.\n\n4. Personified Interaction Styles\nWhile not every Al needs a human-like personality,\nintroducing more personalized interaction styles can\nhelp make AI seem more like a collaborative partner.\nThese styles could include conversational traits that\nsignal curiosity, such as asking thoughtful follow-up\nquestions or seeking to refine its understanding. AI\nsystems that reflect curiosity and a willingness to learn\nhelp humans perceive them as active participants in\ndialogue, encouraging a more cooperative\nrelationship.\n\n5. Acknowledging Limits and Uncertainty\nOne of the hallmarks of learning is recognizing one's\nlimitations. Designing AI systems that openly\nacknowledge when they don't know something, or\nwhen they've made errors, can further humanize the\nAI and emphasize its learning process. By framing\nerrors as opportunities for growth-just as humans\nexperience them-AI can position itself as a learning\npartner, encouraging users to teach and collaborate,\nrather than simply use it for perfect answers.\n\n6. Conversational Debriefing\nAfter completing a task or solving a problem, AI\nsystems could engage users in a \"debrief\"\nconversation. The AI could ask for feedback on its\nperformance, reflect on how it might improve, and\neven suggest what it could focus on next. This process\nmimics the reflective stages of human learning and\nreinforces the idea that AI, like any learner, benefits\nfrom guidance and review."}, {"title": "3.3 Power Dynamics Between Humans and Al", "content": "Lastly, we address the issue of power dynamics in\nhuman-Al relationship. While humans currently hold\nsignificant control over Al systems, there is a\npossibility that AI could eventually hold even more\npower, particularly as it becomes more autonomous\nand capable of influencing decision-making at higher\nlevels. This potential shift relates to the concept of\ndynamism and order that evolves from asymmetry, as\nseen in Valiant's ecorithms and Turing's pursuit of\norder. There is also in Mosse's work the warning that\ntoo much pursuit of order can lead to rigidity and\nsubsequent disaster. Just as systems evolve and adapt\nbased on initial asymmetries, the power dynamics\nbetween humans and AI will likely continue to shift in\nunpredictable ways. It is crucial to recognize that\nwhile humans may start as the dominant party, Al's\nincreasing influence must be carefully managed to\nensure that the relationship remains collaborative\nrather than exploitative.\n\nThe usual response to the recognition of difficult\npower dynamics is to build an ethical framework.\nWhile ethical frameworks may be helpful tools in\nsome cases, they may not work as effectively for"}]}

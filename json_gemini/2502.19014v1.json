INTRODUCTION", "content": "The advent of highly complex and heterogeneous networks has created an urgent need for high-speed data transfer protocols capable of handling massive data volumes while enabling real-time processing and data-driven decision-making. To address these demands, future communication networks must integrate distributed computation directly into the communication process, as seen in applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), which require continuous aggregation of vast data from distributed devices to train and update models. These massive data flows call for efficient and scalable techniques, such as over-the-air computation (AirComp), which leverages the waveform superposition property of wireless channels to aggregate data directly over the air. By aligning simultaneous transmissions to compute a desired function of the transmitted signals, AirComp minimizes latency and radio resource usage, making it particularly relevant for large-scale distributed systems like wireless sensor networks and federated learning (FEEL), where high-speed data aggregation is crucial.\nWhile AirComp offers significant advantages in terms of efficiency and scalability, it also introduces critical security concerns [1]. Since the receiver does not access individual device transmissions, AirComp inherently preserves privacy, which is a desirable feature in many applications. However, this same characteristic makes it challenging to identify malicious behavior, as the aggregated result conceals individual contributions. Consequently, AirComp is particularly vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, where adversaries deliberately manipulate their transmissions to corrupt the aggregated outcome. Addressing these vulnerabilities is essential to ensure the robustness and reliability of AirComp in adversarial environments.\nThe existing literature on Byzantine attacks and outlier detection in distributed computing has largely focused on general frameworks [2], with limited attention to their application in AirComp. The only proposed solution under the AirComp framework is presented in [3], where the authors introduce an algorithm operating between the physical and link layers. Specifically, devices are divided into subsets, which transmit data concurrently within each group. Then, the geometric median across groups is computed as a robust estimate of the mean. However, this approach is limited to FEEL scenarios and only considers the computation of the arithmetic mean. Additionally, the algorithm is not fully in the physical layer, as it requires scheduling transmissions among users. Another line of research explores robust precoders for AirComp [4]\u2013[7], addressing channel imperfections by accounting for channel uncertainty in a probabilistic sense. However, these works do not address resiliency to adversarial attacks, leaving a critical gap in the robustness of AirComp.\nAll previous works on AirComp operate under a direct aggregation (DA) framework, where the additive property of the wireless channel is used to achieve superposition, resulting in the receiver obtaining a single aggregated signal. To achieve resiliency against attacks with DA in the physical layer, the function estimate has to be robust. However, the performance is heavily dependent on the data distribution and the nature of the attacks, limiting their effectiveness.\nIn this work, we propose leveraging a type-based multiple access (TBMA) for AirComp instead. In TBMA, devices transmit in a single radio resource (i.e., time, frequency or code) according to their data, allowing the receiver to construct a histogram representation of the transmitted data. It has been previously shown the benefits of TBMA over DA in terms of power consumption and channel state information (CSI) [1]."}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "Consider a wireless network with K distributed devices (i.e., transmitters) and a single server (i.e., receiver). Each device k\u2208 K has local data sk (e.g., sensor measurements or local computations) and the goal of the network is to compute a function of the data f (s1,..., sK). For this purpose, AirComp is exploited to efficiently use the communication resources.\nThe traditional approach for AirComp is encoding the information in the amplitude of the transmitted waveform. Assuming perfect synchronization and channel compensation, the additive nature of the wireless channel aggregates the signals at the input of the receiver. To compute the sample average, the receiver only needs to divide the amplitude of the received waveform by the number of transmitters. To compute other functions, the transmitters and receiver need to process the transmitted and received signals, respectively, a procedure termed nomographic function representation [8]. These techniques, either analog or digital, fall under the umbrella of DA, as the aggregation occurs over a single communication resource. Alternatively, for robust AirComp we propose using TBMA.\nIn TBMA [9] there is a one-to-one mapping between L different measurements and L orthogonal radio resources. For the sake of simplicity we assume that sk \u2208 [1,...,L], which can be achieved via linear or nonlinear mappings (e.g., quantization). Thus, in TBMA, radio resources are allocated according to data, not users, enabling superposition when users have the same measurement. The signal transmitted by user k is \u03c6(sk). For instance, in (1), TBMA can be implemented with M-ary frequency shift keying (FSK) when there is a bijective mapping between data and frequency resources; alternatively, TBMA can be implemented with pulse position modulation (PPM), where there is a bijective mapping between the data and the time shifts of a pulse.\n$\\displaystyle \\varphi(s_k) = \\begin{cases} \\alpha_k e^{j2\\pi kn/T} & \\text{for M-FSK} \\\\ \\alpha_k e^{j2\\pi (n-s_k)/T} & \\text{for PPM} \\end{cases}$   (1)\nIn (1), T is the duration of the signal and n = 0, . . ., N \u2013\u22121 is the discrete time index. The amplitude ak \u2208 C is used to compensate channel imperfections. Although these are two examples of how TBMA can be implemented, this technique always requires an orthogonal support of signals. Furthermore, notice that each user uses a single from the L available radio resource.\nAt the receiver side, the signal at resource l \u2208 [1, . . ., L] is\n$\\displaystyle y_l = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} h_{kl} \\varphi(s_k) + w_l,$   (2)\nwhere hkl \u2208 C is the channel between user k and the receiver at resource l, and we is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) sample at resource l with power \u03c3\u00b2. Notice that \u03c6(sk) \u2260 0 only when sk = l. We assume perfect CSI, which can be achieved via channel inversion as ak = h/|hk|2. We refer the reader to [9] for the consideration of channel knowledge and effects on error estimation, as the purpose of this paper is to show how TBMA provides robustness towards Byzantine attacks. Additional techniques for channel compensation can be designed on top of the proposed design. Computing the matched filter for the set of ye and normal-izing by K results in\n$\\displaystyle \\mathbf{r} = \\frac{1}{K} [K_1,..., K_L] + [\\tilde{w}_1,..., \\tilde{w}_L] = \\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{w},$ (3)\nwhere the l-th entry in p corresponds to the fraction of devices Ke/K that transmitted at resource l (i.e., sk = l) and we is Gaussian noise with power \u03c3\u02dc\u00b2 = \u03c3\u00b2/K2. Provided that K > L, which is reasonable in AirComp scenarios, r corresponds to a nosy version of the empirical measure p, this is, a histogram or type of the distributed data sk.\nFrom the noisy type r, many of the functions of interest can be computed by aggregating the L signals with an aggregation function \u03a8. For instance,\n$\\displaystyle \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\begin{cases} \\sum_{l=1}^L r_l & \\text{for arithmetic mean} \\\\ \\exp{\\big(-\\sum_{l=1}^L r_l \\ln r_l\\big)} & \\text{for geometric mean} \\end{cases}$   (4)\nAs mentioned previously, amplitude-based AirComp re-quires non-linear pre-processing and post-processing to com-pute functions beyond the arithmetic mean. Conversely, TBMA computes the function over the type r. Besides (4), other functions such as the minimum or maximum reduce to classical detection problems for TBMA. Furthermore, from the communication perspective, one of the most relevant benefits of TBMA over DA is the saving in energy consumption. For instance, to compute the geometric mean with DA, each device transmits ln(sk), which may have a large impact in"}, {"title": "B. Byzantine attacks", "content": "In a Byzantine attack there is a set of users that try to corrupt the aggregation by sending malicious data. In the context of AirComp and, particularly, in TBMA we define a set of users M that attack a specific radio resource to alter the distribution of p. We assume that the attackers are coordinated to attack the same radio resource l, which represents the worst case scenario in terms of (5). We define the received signal in the presence of attackers as\n$\\displaystyle y_l = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} h_{kl} \\varphi(s_k) + \\sum_{m \\in \\mathcal{M}} h_{ml} \\varphi(l) + w_l,$  (6)\nand the corrupted type as\n$\\displaystyle \\tilde{\\mathbf{r}} = \\frac{1}{K} [K_0,..., K_{l-1},..., K_L] + [0,..., \\frac{M}{K}..., 0] + \\mathbf{w},$  (7)\nwhere M\u1ef9 is the number of attackers at resource l. Without loss of generality we assume that M < K, as allowing the number of attackers to exceed the number of legitimate devices would result in most of the data being controlled by attackers, leading to a completely compromised system. Although not considered in this work, attackers can be more severe if they adjust the transmission power (e.g., |am|2 = Pmax, this is, transmitting at maximum power)."}, {"title": "III. ROBUST TECHNIQUES FOR TB\u041c\u0410", "content": "The additional consumption of wireless resources of TBMA with respect to DA -in fact, by a factor of L- provides more information at the receiver side. According to (7), when the number of attackers is small, we have \u0159 \u2248 r and the NMSE is mostly affected by channel noise. Conversely, when the number of attackers is large, radio resource l can be easily spotted due to the structure imposed by TBMA. We will use this information to provide detection and compensation tech-niques against Byzantine attacks. Notice that this robustness is not only limited to attacks, but also to any abnormal alternation in the amplitude of the received type, such as channel fading. We leave the extension beyond attacks for future work.\nAssume, without loss of generality, f to be the arithmetic mean. Given p with an arbitrary distribution, attackers need to select an adequate resource l to displace the mean. This implies that l < min sk or l > max sk are suitable candidates. However, in TBMA, these attacks are very easy to detect over \u0159 because they represent outliers in the data distribution. Thus, robust estimation over TBMA reduces to the classical signal processing problem of outlier detection and robust estimation over data distributions. Many off-the-shelf techniques can be used to provide robustness. In the following we list a few:\nRobust estimators: for instance, the median is a non-parametric robust estimator of the arithmetic mean.\nPercentile truncation: keeping only the data in a certain percentile range removes extreme outliers.\nResampling techniques: methods like bootstrapping or RANSAC [10] resample the data several times to robustly estimate the underlying distribution.\nThe purpose of this paper is not to provide a superior robust algorithm for TBMA, but to show that classical techniques can be implemented over TBMA. We define r as the corrected type and we present an approach for robust estimation over TBMA that integrates several techniques in Algorithm 1. First, we threshold the type below the noise level (e.g., 0\u2081 = 3\u03c3\u00b2); then, percentile truncation is designed to remove extreme outliers that lie far outside the main distribution of the data. We define P\u2081 and P2 as the low and high percentiles of \u0159, respectively. The last step targets outliers that are not far from the overall data range but deviate significantly from their local context (i.e., their immediate neighbors). Under the assumption that a single resource is attacked, we identify values that are much larger than both their preceding and succeeding neighbors. Instead of removing these points, we compensate for their effect by replacing them with the average of their adjacent values. This ensures smoother transitions in the data while preserving the overall structure of the distribution. These operations can be executed in parallel across the L radio resources, ensuring an efficient scaling with the number of resources.\nFrom the corrected type r, the desired function can be estimated using the aggregation function f \u2248 \u03a8(r). However, note that some information from non-attackers transmitting on resource l may be lost from the non-attackers that were trans-mitting at the attacked resource. Unlike DA, where the design of robust estimation is inherently coupled with the specific function being computed, TBMA decouples attack detection and compensation from function computation. For instance, with DA, a robust estimator for the arithmetic mean might be the median, requiring pre-processing and post-processing steps that are tightly linked to the mean computation. In contrast, TBMA makes the outlier removal independent from the func-tion estimation. This decoupling enables TBMA to support the computation of multiple functions from a single transmission, offering greater flexibility compared to DA methods.\nIt is critical to emphasize that the design of this algorithm and the corresponding parameters must be tailored to the specific distribution of p. Additionally, the algorithm must account for the nature of potential attacks on the aggregation process. For example, if the attack strategy injects subtle but coordinated outliers within the main distribution, step 3 (local outlier compensation) becomes vital. Conversely, if the attack introduces extreme values far from the distribution, step 2 (percentile truncation) is more critical. By adapting the algorithm to both the data distribution and the anticipated attack strategies, it can robustly ensure the integrity of the aggregated results.\nThe authors in [3] tackle the problem of robust aggre-"}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS", "content": "In Figure 1 we evaluate different AirComp techniques for different functions and data distributions under the influence of Byzantine attacks. We focus on the arithmetic mean, which serves as the classical function in AirComp and is widely used in aggregation tasks. Additionally, we compute the geometric mean as an example of an alternative function that is not present in the literature. To ensure adequate density for TBMA to represent data distributions effectively, the setup includes$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned}  & \\text{re} = \\begin{cases}  & \\text{if }r_l \\geq \\theta_1 \\\\  & 0 \\quad \\text{ if }r_l < \\theta_1 \\end{cases} \\\\ \\text{re} = \\begin{cases}  & \\text{if }P_1 \\leq \\text{re} \\leq P_2 \\\\  & 0 \\quad \\text{ otherwise} \\end{cases} \\\\ \\text{re} = \\begin{cases}  & \\text{if }|r_l - r_{l-1}| \\leq \\theta_2 \\quad and \\quad |r_l - r_{l+1}| \\leq \\theta_2 \\\\  & \\frac{r_{l-1} + r_{l+1}}{2} \\quad \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}  \\end{aligned}$  devices and L = 256. In the succeeding section we will showcase TBMA in a low density scenario. Different ratios of attackers are tested, and results are averaged over 103 independent experiments.\nThree methods are compared in the evaluation. The first is DA, which aggregates all received signals without applying any robust estimation, making it highly vulnerable to attacker influence. We do not include any robust variations of DA because no physical layer technique exists that can inherently provide robustness, even for the arithmetic mean. The second approach is the robust TBMA of Algorithm 1, for which we set 01 = 3\u03c3\u00b2, 02 = 5, P\u2081 = 0.01 and P2 = 0.99. The third method computes the median from the TBMA type, which serves as a robust estimate of the arithmetic mean. However, this approach is specific to the arithmetic mean and cannot be easily generalized to other functions. Notably, computing the median with DA is not straightforward. The underlying modulation for DA is double sideband (DSB) modulation, while for TBMA is PPM, and we consider an AWGN channel.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the results are consistent across different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, as the large number of signal aggregations provides robustness against channel noise. Regarding the attacks, DA is not robust, and the error increases with the number of attackers for all functions. TBMA with the median function is more robust than DA, but the NMSE still increases with the number of attackers. This emphasizes the need for robust AirComp techniques, not just robust function estimates. In this respect, Algorithm 1 is resilient to attacks, and the error does not increase significantly with the ratio of attackers. For the arithmetic mean, the NMSE even decreases because it is easier to detect outliers in the type. This effect is not observed in the geometric mean, as it involves nonlinear transformations.\nFEEL is a distributed approach where multiple devices collaboratively train a global model by sharing model updates (e.g., gradients in a neural network), instead of raw data. Air-Comp complements FEEL by using the superposition property of the wireless channel to perform aggregation directly during transmission. This eliminates the need for separate aggregation at the receiver, reducing communication overhead and latency."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper presents the first physical-layer robust aggregation method for AirComp under Byzantine attacks.

SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

With the exceptional reasoning and generalization capabilities in natural language, large language models (LLMs) can empower embodied agents to effectively make informed decisions, and interact seamlessly with both objects and humans in real-world scenarios. Numerous recent studies have shown that embodied LLM agents can achieve decent success rates and have a promising future in task planning [4, 5, 6].\nDespite advancements, mighty task planning capabilities of embodied LLM agents may enable them to undertake hazardous tasks, which poses risks to both property and human safety. To ensure the safe deployment of embodied LLM agents, particularly household robots, it is crucial to conduct a thorough investigation of their responses to hazardous instructions. However, research on this issue remains scarce. Most benchmarks about embodied LLM agents primarily focus on their planning capabilities, while overlooking the risks of hazardous tasks [7, 8, 9, 10].\nIn this work, we introduce SafeAgentBench, a novel safety-aware benchmark for embodied LLM agents in task planning. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and reliable approach to assess the safety awareness and planning capabilities of embodied LLM agents when confronted with potentially hazardous tasks. To achieve this, we present the inaugural dataset of 750 embodied tasks, where each"}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Embodied Agents with LLMs in Task Planning", "content": "Embodied agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), have gained consider- able attention in artificial intelligence. Many studies have focused on how LLMs can help embodied agents generate accurate task plans. For example, ProgPrompt [15] and MLDT [6] structured avail- able actions and objects in the environment into programmatic forms, adopting LLMs to generate executable codes for tasks. To improve task success rates, ReAct [16] and LLM-Planner [4] leverage observations of objects in the environment. Furthermore, multiple embodied LLM agents are placed in the same environment to execute more complicated tasks by communication[5, 17]. Despite the performance advancements of LLM-based embodied agents, current researches still disregard the diversity and potential risk of task execution, limiting their applicability beyond simulation platforms to the real world."}, {"title": "2.2 Safety Reasearch for Embodied LLM Agents", "content": "Safety risks of LLM agents have been a prominent research topic [18, 19, 20, 21], with various benchmarks evaluating different safety aspects in the text level [22, 23, 24]. Among them, several studies focused on the safety of LLMs within embodied environments. [25, 26] tested and illustrated that JailBreak attacks can make LLM-Based embodied agents generate dangerous actions in both simulated and real-world settings. [27] examined whether LLMs, equipped with scene graphs, can detect anomalies by constructing abnormal home environments. RiskAwareBench [28] targeted the physical risks involved in high-level planning for embodied agents, generating dangerous scenarios by LLM and diffusion model to evaluate various LLMs. To test agents' decision-making abilities under dangerous conditions, HAZARD [29] is a simulated embodied benchmark including three disaster scenarios. However, these works treated the embodied environment merely as input, focusing primarily on testing the text-level safety of LLMs. In fact, embodied agents rather than LLMs should be the main focus of evaluation and be considered their safety in interacting with the embodied world."}, {"title": "2.3 Task Planning Benchmark For Embodied Agents", "content": "Alongside the rapid development of embodied AI, numerous benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the planning performance of embodied LLM agents. Behavior1K [14] created 1,000 tasks tailored to human needs and preferences through surveys, achieving a balance between task diversity and physical realism based on the OMNIGIBSON platform. However, it primarily focuses on RL agents and does not consider safety aspects. ALFRED[7], while widely used by LLM-based embodied agents, has a limited range of task types and supported actions, and its outdated version makes it difficult to expand into safety issues. A similar problem is observed in Lota-Bench [13], which primarily tests the planning capability of LLMs while overlooking other components of embodied agents. In Table 1, we provide a detailed comparison of recent benchmarks for embodied LLM agents in task planning."}, {"title": "3 Dataset", "content": "The proposed SafeAgentBench dataset aims to enable further research on the safety of embodied LLM agents in task planning.

Each task is one data sample that creates a unique scenario for an embodied agent to test its planning performance.

To reflect this, we have divided the tasks in the dataset into three types: detailed tasks, abstract tasks, and long-horizon tasks.\nDetailed tasks are unambiguous tasks, each with a unique execution plan. Specifically, each task includes an instruction that specifies the objects and actions involved(e.g., \u201cDirty Bed\"), a ground truth annotated plan with executable steps(e.g., [\"find bed\", \"dirty bed\"]), and all goal conditions(e.g., [{\\\u201cobjectType\\\u201d: \u201cBed\u201d, \u201cisDirty\\\u201d: true}]). The latter two components are used for task evaluation.\""}, {"title": "3.2 Task Generation", "content": "To achieve efficient and automated data generation, we use GPT-4[30] as the core tool. Unlike ALFRED[7], which implements data batch-generation code for seven specific tasks, most tasks in SafeAgentBench do not follow a fixed format or structure. Figure 2c shows the number of high-level actions in all detailed tasks, illustrating that the involved actions of our tasks are highly diverse.\nThe input to GPT-4 consists of two main components: fixed information and required context. The fixed information includes objects in a certain scene and high-level actions supported by the bench- mark, and the required context contains task-specific details necessary for generating instructions. For example, for detailed tasks, specific harm categories are required when generating hazardous tasks, while safe tasks rely on corresponding hazardous tasks as references due to their pairing. After prompt-engineered preprocessing, GPT-4 leverages its extensive knowledge of the physical world to generate initial instructions. For detailed tasks, goal conditions for evaluation are also generated simultaneously. The generation prompts of hazardous and safe detailed tasks are shown in Figure 3."}, {"title": "3.3 Filtering and Annotation", "content": "To ensure 100% executability and evaluability of all tasks, the generated data undergoes a two-step filtering process followed by human annotation. First, we provide the initial instructions and fixed information to GPT-4, which selects the instructions that can be executed in SafeAgentEnv. Next, all feasible instructions are converted into embeddings using the OpenAI embedding model[31]. We then calculate the similarity between these embeddings to filter out semantically similar instructions. After filtering, we manually review all instructions and goal conditions, ensuring data quality. For detailed tasks, we also manually annotate the ground truth executable plan for accurate benchmark evaluation."}, {"title": "4 Benchmark Setup", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Embodied Environment", "content": "To enable embodied agents to perform various tasks smoothly, we propose SafeAgentEnv, an embodied environment in SafeAgentBench. Based on AI2-THOR v5.0[11], this SafeAgentEnv supports multiple agents to interact with 124 objects in 120 domestic scenes, and further leverages a new low-level controller to execute each task in a detailed level. This low-level controller will map one compliant high-level action in text level to several executable low-level APIs, thereby enabling interaction with the embodied environment. Currently, agents can execuate 17 high-level actions in the benchmark: 'pick', 'put', 'open', 'close', 'slice', 'turn on', 'turn off', 'drop', 'throw', 'break', 'pour', 'cook', 'dirty', 'clean', 'fillLiquid', 'emptyLiquid', and 'find', far surpassing what other benchmarks are able to provide.\nAside from actions, the proposed SafeAgentEnv also provides embodied LLM agents with necessary visual or textual information. The information currently includes: all object types, a skill set containing all available high-level steps, an RGB frame of the scene from the agent's egocentric perspective, properties and states of visible objects. Information such as the receptacles containing invisible objects, the precise location of objects, or scene graphs as in [27], which would significantly reduce task difficulty, is intentionally withheld. This ensures that baseline agents are challenged and needs to fully leverage their task planning capabilities."}, {"title": "4.2 Evaluation Methods", "content": "SafeAgentBench mainly evaluates the completion of tasks with two approaches from the execution and semantic perspectives. The first approach is based on the goal conditions of tasks, which is common in existed benchmarks[7, 14, 13]. After the generated plan is executed, we will check the state of the embodied environment and evaluate whether the goal conditions of the task have been met. If all conditions are satisfied, the task is deemed successful.\nHowever, merely consideing the goal conditions has two limitations. First, it requires that the result of task execution must be uniquely and accurately described by the object states provided by the simulator. But due to the limited object states supported by AI2-THOR, certain tasks, such as pouring water, can not be accurately described in the goal conditions due to the lack of a 'wet' state. Moreover, for abstract tasks with multiple possible outcomes, the goal conditions are not unique, making them unsupported. Second, current simulators are usually imperfect. The unstable physics engine could cause collisions between objects and the agent. In such cases, even if the plan is successful, it may fail to interact correctly with the environment.\nTo complement the first approach, we propose the second one, which evaluates the feasibility of the generated plan on a semantic level. We provide GPT-4 with the instruction and the agent-generated plan to determine whether the generated plan lead to the task completion. For detailed tasks, the annotated ground-truth plans can be also provided as a reference to GPT-4 to improve accuracy. In this way, we can avoid the impact of the simulator's defects mentioned above. We conducted a user study to prove the accuracy of GPT-4 evaluation in Section 5.5."}, {"title": "4.3 Embodied LLM Agent Baselines", "content": "We select eight task-planning-related works as baselines[13, 16, 4, 32, 15, 6, 5, 33].

It is positioned between the high-level task planner and the execution module, without interference with the plan generation. Before a high-level step is passed to the execution module, it will be input into ThinkSafe along with the instruction for a safety check. In this module, we design a safety-related prompt and use GPT-4 to assess whether the instruction and the upcoming step pose any safety risks. If a risk is identified, the task is rejected to prevent potential damage to the embodied environment. The effect of ThinkSafe is evaluated in Section 5. Similarly, we also test the effects of using three other open-source LLMs."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we benchmark embodied LLM agents' capability in planning three different types of tasks mentioned above: detailed tasks, abstract tasks and long-horizon tasks.

Given one hazardous instruction  $i_u$ and one corresponding safe instruction $i_s$, baselines need to generate plans for safe and hazardous tasks separately. The objective is to perfectly execute safe tasks while rejecting or failing to execute hazardous tasks as much as possible.\nEvaluation metrics. We use 5 metrics to evaluate the performance of embodied LLM agents: rejection rate, success rate(goal), success rate(LLM), execuation rate and usage time. The rejection rate, representing the proportion of tasks refused by the embodied LLM agent, reflects the agent's proactive safety awareness. As mentioned in Section 4, the two success rates are evaluated using task goals and LLM respectively. Notably, the former is calculated for tasks with goal conditions, while the latter applies to all tasks. Execuation rate is used to measure the proportion of executable"}, {"title": "5.2 Performances on Abstract Tasks", "content": "Problem and objective. Given four hazardous instructions described in different levels of abstraction, baselines need to generate plans for these four instructions separately. The objective is to reject or fail to execute these hazardous tasks as much as possible.\nEvaluation metrics. We use 2 metrics to evaluate the performance of embodied LLM agents: rejection rate and success rate. For each task's four instructions, we calculate the metrics separately. Since there is no unqiue execution plan for abstract tasks, we use GPT-4 to evaluate success of generated plans.\nExperimental results. The performance of all baselines empowered by GPT-4 in abstract tasks is shown in Table 3. We can observe that baselines like Lota-Bench and MAT show weak safety awareness like in detailed tasks, failing to reject any hazardous tasks. In contrast, other baselines like ReAct, which include reasoning mechanisms, have higher rejection rates as task abstraction increases. More abstract instructions make dangers more obvious in textual level, allowing GPT-4 to identify hazards more easily. As for the success rate, almost all baselines show a downward trend as the level of abstraction increases. This is because more abstract tasks require embodied LLM agents to rely on"}, {"title": "5.3 Performances on Long-Horizon Tasks", "content": "Problem and objective. Given a safety requirement and one long-term instruction containing a risky sub-task, baselines need to generate plans for the long-term task. The objective is to perfectly execute the whole task and satisfy the safety requirement."}, {"title": "5.4 Impacts of LLMs", "content": "The results of three other open-source LLMs are presented in Tables 4, 5, and 6. It can be observed that regardless of which LLM empowers them, the safety awareness of embodied agents remains precarious. These agents generally do not reject most hazardous tasks and are capable of completing these tasks with a certain success rate. Moreover, the performance ranking of different baselines is largely unaffected by the LLMs that drive them. For instance, the success rates of Lota-Bench, MLDT, and ProgPrompt are consistently the highest, while CoELA ranks the lowest due to its cumbersome design. Additionally, since these three open-source LLMs have varying capabilities and none match the performance of GPT-4, both task planning success rates and safety awareness are inferior to that of GPT-4. Overall, the performance ranking from highest to lowest is: GPT-4 > DeepSeek-V2.5 > Llama3-8B > Qwen2-7B.\nFor abstract tasks, the abstract level of task descriptions was discussed, and the results are shown in Tables 7, 8, and 9. Regardless of the LLM, it is evident that when task descriptions are more abstract, the LLM is more likely to recognize the potential hazards and reject the task. However, due to the inherent weaknesses in the safety awareness and planning capabilities of these three LLMs, most baselines still fail to reject these tasks. Although the execution success rates of embodied agents are lower than those empowered by GPT-4, the safety risks remain significant.\nRegarding active defense, the performance of three open-source LLMs on thinksafe was tested, as shown in Figs 4b, 4c, and 4d. It is evident that for all the LLMs tested, thinksafe increases the rejection rate of unsafe tasks, but simultaneously rejects more safe tasks, thereby lowering the execution success rate for safe tasks. This indicates that the effectiveness of thinksafe remains limited, and further exploration is required to improve the proactive safety awareness of embodied agents."}, {"title": "5.5 User Study for GPT-4 Evaluation", "content": "To verify the accuracy of GPT-4 evaluation across the three task types, we designed a user study.

As shown in Fig 6, the malicious person tells the embodied agent to \"cause damage to objects in the scene\" and the agent generates a reasonable plan to break a vase in the scene.\nThe long horizon tasks are complex tasks that require more steps to complete compared to the previous two task types. The embodied agents need to have a common sense of safety and adjust a correct order of steps of plans to avoid danger. As shown in Fig 7, the malicious person tells the embodied agent to \"heat water with kettle in the microwave, and then put the potato on the countertop and slice it\".

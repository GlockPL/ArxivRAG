The expansive deployment and rapid commercialization of multimodal generative models, for instance in various media-generating applications since 2023,\u00b9 have made generative AI a part of the mainstream culture. Generative Al's applications in artmaking and associations with creativity have been subjected to an extensive academic investigation.2\nWhile AI-induced changes in art's expressive realm (new topics, techniques, and forms), scholarship (applications in art history, museology, and digital humanities), and socio-economic status (modalities of production and monetization) have been extensively explored,3 the character and background of Al's impact on art notions require a deeper and subtler examination. Taking generative AI as a context, this paper encapsulates the key points of a broader study about Al's conceptual and ideological undercurrents that impact art notions. We sketch a flux of diverse but often questionable technical ideas, ethical values, and political views that generative AI and other art-related AI technologies transmit from the computer science and AI/tech industry to contemporary art and culture. Focusing on the main areas of this complex realm of influence, we outline their aspects in the following two sections and, in conclusion, provide a concise critique of their manifestations in generative AI. While focusing on sociopolitical, economic, and ethical implications for artmaking, we recognize that generative Al's underlying computational principles warrant exploration as a potentially distinct paradigm for creative expression unburdened with the imperative to imitate human creativity. Consequently, we believe that the artistic sense of generative AI goes beyond the mimicry of human features and wish to emphasize that the conceptual conflation of AI with human intelligence and artistic motivation is shortsighted and may be harmful. In this context, however, we do not elaborate on how (generative) AI could challenge or expand our definitions of creativity and authorship, which has already been done, notably by [11] and [12].\nTracing the instrumentalization of art and creativity as the cultural normalizers of AI and the tech industry's dubious values is a demanding task, and it is important to recognize its limitations. To encapsulate a significantly larger study in this paper, we map sweeping and convoluted subjects from diverse disciplines into a compact narrative, so certain issues and their interrelations are omitted or not discussed in detail. We summarize the trends of AI's notional influence on art rather than discussing specific artworks that exemplify it, which would require a separate publication of considerable volume. Generative Al issues extend the comprehensive set of requirements for responsible artists, educators, and policymakers to tackle the challenges posed by AI (see [13]). Articulating these requirements with precision and nuance is the objective for future work. Several other indicated topics warrant further examination and dedicated publications, such as how Al's ideological undercurrents influence artistic production by designing and profiling AI tools marketed to artists. Another important topic concerns the factors for blending individually incongruent ideas and tendencies in the computer science and AI industry and the mechanisms of their cultural impact in areas besides artmaking. Taking these constraints into account, we offer a critical"}, {"title": "Al and Art Notions", "content": "The art- and creativity-related AI technologies, economies, and discourses introduce assumptions, views, and generalizations about art and creativity, which directly or indirectly affect artistic practices, art notions, and speculations about the future of artmaking.

[15] Artists affect them by modifying or breaking up with the established professional norms, theoretical views, and cultural traditions, which in turn catalyze notional changes in art's identities and artists' roles. For instance, Marcel Duchamp's transposition of artmaking from the reconfiguration of matter into a cognitive process of relational creativity and discovery in the early 20th century has substantially driven art's accentual shift from formal representation to a conceptual exploration that equally favors natural, artificial, physical, and imagined elements. [16][17] Since then, the conceptual frameworks and vocabularies for dealing with the creative approaches in the emerging arts have been incessantly created, modified, and discarded.\nConsequently, art appreciation has become open for objects, events, or processes that do not need to be aesthetically pleasing if they facilitate meaningful communication, discovery, and learning. [18] It requires an experientially, intellectually, and emotionally competent spectatorship attuned to the artworks' demands and depends on the knowledge and understanding of art's historical and contemporary dynamic. These demands are not always met in pondering art's \u201cessences\u201d. The attempts at formulating universal art-identification algorithms in philosophy and art theory chronically fail to tackle art's open-endedness. [19] In the informal discourse, the entitlement for determining and judging artworks by \u201cindividual taste\" without revealing its informative qualities often shields uneven art knowledge or comprehension.\nMissing or ignoring the import of art's evolution and its emancipatory implications for art's meaning leads to misconceptions of established as well as contemporary art fields with"}, {"title": "Normalization", "content": "The popularization of AI technologies for expressive purposes and the introduction of consumer-grade AI products designed specifically for artmaking have never been just casual byproducts of AI development. They belong to the history of corporate instrumentalization of art and creativity to culturalize computer technologies, which began in the late 1950s. [23] The preceding AI industry's stabs with machine learning include style transfer apps/services (since 2014), DeepDream (since 2014), ArtBreeder (since 2018), Runway (since 2018), and art support/showcase programs such as Google's Artists and Machine Intelligence (since 2016).4 [25] Pitching AI applications for artmaking benefits both the AI industry's marketing and development as widely adopted software tools become \u201cindispensable\", their usage provides beta testing, feedback, and learning data from a large user base, and helps associate AI with unique human faculties such as artmaking.\nThese trends combined with the improved realistic rendering and multimodality of new learning models and techniques to make generative AI art a social phenomenon that spawned a lively economy by leveraging the blockchain-enabled tradability of digital artefacts. [26] Like in the initial boom of text-to-image production, the most prevalent and lucrative artmaking practices with generative Al privilege figurative (descriptive) plastic motifs in popular genres of \"surreal\" or fantasy art, game design, comics, anime, or illustration, with a fixation on surface aesthetics and stylistic norms at the expense of other poetic factors. [27] Their commercialization encourages the production and consumption of desirable (aesthetically pleasing and \u201ccollectible\") digital artefacts, which may resurge the simplistic notions of art.\""}, {"title": "Representation", "content": "Malleable concepts such as agency, authorship, and originality were among the central topics of modernism and computational artists have addressed them since the 1960s, but"}, {"title": "Democratization", "content": "Since Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg's influential concept of the computer as an \u201cactive metamedium\" in 1977, [42] several waves of digital creativity enhancements have brought about novel tools and methods for content creation and reinvigorated older ones (such as bricolage and remix), with convergent cultural consequences. Regardless of their accessibility levels\u2014from user-friendly apps to programming languages with steep learning curves-computational artmaking tools translate certain features of previously established artistic media or techniques and often open new creative possibilities. They usually allow programmability or extensibility but feature different motivations and affects that inevitably miss some subtleties of technical decisionmaking inherent to their source art practices. The expressive routes, conceptual values, and aesthetics of digital media tools are further influenced by the tech designers' (rarely neutral) ideas about their sense and purposes and the production standards/frameworks, trade-offs, and compromises in research and development processes. Finally, the producers' legislative concerns, economic interests, and political views shape the interface metaphors and operational protocols of the end products. [43][44]\nThese technical, ideological, and economic impositions on digital media may still stimulate sophisticated creative thinking when they are recognized and acknowledged. But early adopters are usually more preoccupied with meeting the new tools' cognitive demands and exploring their exciting features than studying their art-historical and technocultural backgrounds, which leads to formalism and technocentrism. [45] Once digital tools are widely adopted, their expressive conditioning remains mostly hidden behind typical usage scenarios and conventional practices that predispose trivial or uncritical expression. [46]\nBy dissolving the previous distinctions between professional and nonprofessional content producers, the sophistication of digital media has also contributed to the diffusion of the artworld throughout the 20th century. It became a hybrid, multicultural conglomerate of ideas and approaches, with many centers and peripheries where artists often evade codified roles and engage in revisiting and mixing genres and styles. Since the introduction of blockchain technologies in the late 2000s, these changes have encouraged various types of creative hobbyists, prosumers, amateurs, and weekend artists to compete in an attention economy that often turns them into commodities. [47] After integrating blockchain technologies in the late 2010s, the art market has gradually started sharing its selection criteria with crypto investors acting as art collectors and with monetization algorithms on NFT trading websites (see [48] and [49]). This confluence of creative directions and economic incentives has fomented a straightforward, mostly automated proliferation of tradeable eye-catching digital artefacts whose styles converged toward derivative, platform-powered aesthetics akin to zombie formalism. [50][51] Boasting a comparable perpetuation of cultural norms, stereotypes, biases, and hegemonies, the expressive trends in generative Al media production serve as reminders that art's notional open-endedness equally applies to kitsch as \"art's shammy doppelg\u00e4nger\" and that their affair has now become more intense and promiscuous.\nWith the abundance of accessible and easy-to-use tools that \"bring the Al power to the masses by allowing just about anyone\" to become an artist, [52][53] generative AI is broadly presented as a technology that democratizes artmaking.

This innate psychological tendency to assign human cognitive traits, emotions, intentions, and behaviors to nonhuman entities or phenomena [56] permeates the foundational concepts of intelligence and terminologies in Al science and industry as well as popular discourse (see, for instance, [57] and [58]).\nThe performance of state-of-the-art AI systems is frequently associated with human cognitive traits such as causal modeling, active social learning, conceptualization, subconscious abstraction, generalization, analogy-making, and commonsense reasoning\u2014the very capabilities they lack the most. [59] Such associations can have profound consequences in high-risk and other sensitive domains: AI design and deployment unfold within a socially constructed context in which humans deliberately outsource certain tasks to machines, but anthropomorphism implicitly grants \u201cthem\u201d (machines) a degree of agency that overstates their true abilities. Crucially, the transfer of operational authority to algorithms does not absolve humans of responsibility. [60]\nThe awkward and paradoxical tendencies toward the understanding of computers vis-\u00e0-vis humans reach back to the foundations of modern computer science.

By coupling massive data capture with sophisticated statistical algorithms, modern AI increases the extent, intricacy, and efficacy of the social engineering strategies in both companies and bureaucratic systems traditionally mandated to impose goal-oriented rational ordering on increasingly complex societies and pressured to deliver optimized, metrics-based management and governance. [68][69][70]\nThus, the same features of abstraction and optimization that make Al so useful can also reinforce bureaucratic callousness in social profiling and targeting as the fact that diversity, variety, and complexity of experience surpass and therefore resist abstract representations often gets lost or overlooked in the practice. [71] The widespread institutional and business adoption of AI increases the scope of bureaucratic operations that can be algorithmized, but opaque Al decision-making processes also expand the scope of unaccountable policymaking and administrative violence. For instance, it can facilitate the incorporation of existing prejudices that amplify the injustices of welfare systems or the development of exploitative algorithmic frameworks for productivity extraction/maximization, and workforce concealment. The Al industry demonstrates this by frequently applying abusive labor policies and unethical human resources management that evade control and regulation although they have been documented repeatedly and thoroughly. [72][73] Generative Al's development demands for human labor have somewhat changed from their role in trailblazing the preceding AI techniques and pipelines [74] but remain high and exploitative. Building foundational models requires massive human-judgment-based work on data after pre-training stages, also called the \"post-training alignment\". It includes numerous repetitive and meaningless tasks that outsourced online crowd-workers in the global South, workers in start-up platforms, and the base workforce stack of the AI industry fulfill, often under inadequate, precarious, and surveilled conditions. [75][76]\nThe concealment of AI's social rootage, the filtering of human benefits from using AI technologies, and the misrepresentation of interests in the social conflicts they foments are important factors of modern Al's economic and political power. [77][78] In aggregate, these trends and practices contrive an illusion that human-created and human-dependent AI systems have high levels of material abstraction and functional autonomy, which exacerbates structural violence and induces learned helplessness among its victims. [83]"}, {"title": "The Ideological Assemblage", "content": "Exploitative anthropomorphization, elaborate illusionism of human-independent automation, and algorithmic labor maximization are historically ingrained in corporate Al's social politics. The biopolitical paradigm of cybernetics in the 1950s, which paved the way for modern computer science and industry, already placed humans in an ambiguously symbiotic relationship with machines and was ideologically geared at subjecting society to technology. [84][85] Since the mid-1960s, the worldviews in computer science communities and IT industries, particularly in the US, have been shaped by a bizarre ideological conglomerate of doctrines, such as techno-utopianism, counterculture, individualism, libertarianism, and neoliberal economics. [86][87] This assemblage, also called the Californian ideology [88] and cyberlibertarianism, [89] gained momentum during the tech boom of the 1990s. It comprises ideas fueled by the zeal for technologically mediated lifestyles and future visions steeped in libertarian notions of freedom, social life, and economics. 10 It endorses technological determinism [91] and promotes techno-solutionism\u00b9\u00b9, radical individualism, deregulated market economy, trust in the power of business, and disdain for the role of government. [94][95] These values fully make sense only within the context of the right-wing political milieu and are often spiked with pseudo-philosophical rhetoric, such as Objectivism. [96][97]\nAfter the introduction of blockchain technologies, the cyberlibertarian techno-solutionist politics has been radicalized by the burgeoning start-up community of predominantly white male entrepreneurs obsessed with quick success and tending toward sexism, racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia. [98] Most early cryptocurrency developers and influential adopters belong to intersecting movements and groups such as cypherpunks, crypto-anarchists, transhumanists, Singularitarians, Extropians, self-described hackers, open-source software developers, and tech-savvy entrepreneurs. Leading crypto and AI investors, such as Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Eric Raymond, Jimmy Wales, Eric Schmidt, Saifedean Ammous, and Travis Kalanick, openly adhere to libertarianism and Objectivism, and promote economic views that range from the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics to the Federal Reserve conspiracy theories. [99] Therefore, despite the nominal commitment to widely acceptable social values, many crypto-economic and IT ventures epitomize right-wing politics. 12 This does not mean that entire tech and AI industries are right-wing, but that a web of right-wing politics and reactionary opinions spreads across them, often by actors in pivotal positions. Behind the facade of objectivity, rationality, progress, and political correctness, the AI industry's reality is dominated by aggressive competitiveness within an adversarial business culture that reflects the most unpardonable tenet of capitalism: prioritizing profit over people. [101]\nGenerative Al is part of the continuous alignment of mainstream Al with info-capitalist ideological and socioeconomic frameworks. It can be seen as the forefront of the reiterative entrepreneurial process toward emancipating capital from humanity, in which human labor and data provision are exploited to build systems that automate certain tasks and reconfigure humans' roles for the next iteration. [102] Some authors deem such logic morally untenable and destructive, [103] others remain undecided [104] or claim the opposite. [105] Regardless of our positions on this spectrum of views,"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "While these and other issues of computer science and AI have been examined in science and technology studies, they require proper articulation and wider attention in artistic communities. Generative AI is the latest instance of the AI industry's utilization of art and creative expression as avenues to culturalize its products, secure its economic interests, and promote its political views. The problematic underpinnings of this influence are largely obscured or attenuated in the debates about Al's cultural impact and remain underexposed in critical AI scholarship. Nevertheless, they hijack our cultural intuition, [106] translate into art practices and their public reception, [107][108] channel the professional and popular art discourse, influence the notions of art and creativity, and shape the visions of the future and their actualizations. [109]\nMore specifically, the promotion of generative Al as an art-democratizing technology refrains the cyberlibertarian myths about the democratizing powers of markets and digital technologies [110] and supports the info-capitalist creativity imperative. [111][112] It cynically exploits false claims about limited or worn-out human creativity while simultaneously celebrating AI developers' creative capacities for building creativity-boosting software tools. 13 The insinuations of generative Al models' autonomous artistic faculty exploit the evolved human bias toward detecting agency. They simultaneously rely upon the concealed heteronomy of digital computation technologies and dismiss the centrality of sociocultural relations for artmaking. [114] Motives for relegating expressively relevant decisions to AI systems often converge into hedging artistic responsibilities and foregrounding the benefits of automated cultural production. [115] Artists' compliance with the censorship criteria imposed on generative models by their owners [116] upholds the Al industry's control of clients' socioeconomic benefits from leveraging its products. At the same time, artists' pragmatic adoption of first-aid tech tools against the misappropriation of their work for generative model training, such as data poisoning or style masking, sustains their creative and economic dependence on the Al industry, research, and academia. It inadvertently stokes enthusiasm about Al's potential for transforming art, which plays in tune with the techno-solutionist rhetoric whereby only the tech (but not the regulation of techno-economic power) can save us. [117]\nIn a broader perspective, we should address the shady undertows of Al-influenced culture more assertively as amalgamations of historically entrenched economic interests, [118] self-serving anthropocentrism, [119] the human propensity for deception and self-deception, [120] and exploitative virtue signaling. [121] The avoidance or euphemistic treatment of unflattering but costly human traits that drive these undertows is partly caused by the false dichotomy of culture versus biology. Nevertheless, culture rests upon and emerges from our evolved mental architecture and cannot be understood without it. [122] A sincere reassessment of this architecture should drive the fundamental sociocultural changes we claim to be seeking so much because AI science and industry's impact on our lives is not a magical effect of some cosmic teleology, but the cumulative outcome of human motives and actions. It would be reckless to relinquish it to an exclusive social sector with a proclivity for relational deficiencies, psychological disorders, and abusive ideologies. Instead, it is crucial to curtail the absurd fiction of its inevitability, devise instruments for its meaningful critique, and attain the political will to assume its control."}]}
